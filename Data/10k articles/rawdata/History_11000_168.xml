[https://books.google.com/books?id=157YAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=1000th+anniversary+of+christianization+of+rus&amp;dq=1000th+anniversary+of+christianization+of+rus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AGeQUqO-DcSlkQXsyoC4BA&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCQ "The Christianization of Ancient Russia: A Millennium, 988-1988."] UNESCO 1998. Accessed at Google Books 23 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the celebrations were planned for the church only. However, the anniversary became a statewide event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravmir.com/life-of-orthodox-church-from-kiev-to-vladivostok/ "Life of the Orthodox Church from Kiev to Vladivostok"] Pravmir.com photo report. 4 July 2013. Accessed in English 23 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; That this was allowed to occur marked a shift in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] policy concerning the church.&lt;ref&gt;Sajo (Ed.) et al [https://books.google.com/books?id=JxMVr0Fv5uAC&amp;dq=1000th+anniversary+of+christianization+of+rus&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s "The Law of Religious Identity: Models for Post-Communism."] Kluwer Law International, 1999

==Background==
On December 23, 1980, the [[Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church]] elected to "start preparing for the celebration of the Russian Orthodox Church of the forthcoming Great Jubilee."&lt;ref&gt;Определения Священного Синода. // ЖМП. 1981, № 2, стр. 4—5.&lt;/ref&gt; A Jubilee Committee, chaired by [[Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus'|Patriarch]] [[Patriarch Pimen I|Pimen]] convened. The committee assumed its task would be confined to the church.

===Danilov Monastery===
On May 17, 1983, in [[Moscow]], the buildings of the former [[Danilov Monastery]] were officially transferred to the control of the Church. The buildings became the domain and a "spiritual and administrative center" of the [[Moscow Patriarchate]].&lt;ref&gt;ЖМП. 1983, № 8, стр. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen to representing a new change in the attitude of the government to the needs of the Orthodox Church in the USSR. It was the first time a monastic cloister had been returned to the Church in the period since 1930. This generated interest about the upcoming anniversary in the general public. In 1984, there was political obstruction to the establishment of a monastic community at the Danilov monastery. When [[Konstantin Chernenko]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party]] died, the objections ended. In 1986, state policy on religion and the rights of religious citizens was further relaxed. The media was able to report about instances of persecution of religious citizens and the Church, and present the Church as a guardian of national culture and spirituality.

==Organisation==
The Soviet leadership was ultimately cooperative in the organisation of the celebrations. Bishops met at [[Novodevichy Convent]] from 28–31 March 1988. The minutes read,
: "Members of the Bishops' Pre-Council Meeting gratefully consider it necessary to note the positive attitude of the Soviet Government to the questions put forward by the Hierarchy of the Church".
On April 29, 1988, at the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], general secretary of the [[CPSU]] ([[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]]) met the [[Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia]], [[Patriarch Pimen I|Pimen]] and the permanent members of the [[Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church]] in order to discuss the anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;ЖМП. 1988, № 7, стр. 2—6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leustean L. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2oOht_5bg6UC&amp;dq=1000th+anniversary+of+christianization+of+rus&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s "Eastern Christianity and the Cold War, 1945-91."] Routledge, 2009
{{ISBN|0203865944}}, 9780203865941 p31. Accessed in English at Google Books, 23 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The success of this meeting was a signal to the government and to the people that the anniversary celebrations could be supported and shared. The  [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]], the museums of the [[Moscow Kremlin]], the Svyato-Vvedenskaya Kozelskaya Optina Pustyn Monastery of [[Kaluga]] and the cloisters at Yaroslavl were allocated for the use of the Church.

==Celebrations==
The main anniversary celebrations took place between June 5 and 12, 1988 in [[Zagorsk]] and [[Moscow]].

===Council meeting===
On June 6, 1988, the [[1988 Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church|1988 Local council meeting]] of the Russian Orthodox Church was opened at [[Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius]]. It closed on June 9, 1988.

===Re-opening of Danilov Monastery===
On June 12, 1988, Church leaders including the [[Patriarch of Antioch]], [[Ignatius IV of Antioch|Ignatius IV]], [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Patriarch Diodoros of Jerusalem|Diodoros I]], Patriarch Pimen, the Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia [[Ilia II]], Patriarch Teoctist of Romania, the Patriarch [[Maxim of Bulgaria]] and Archbishop of Cyprus [[Chrysostomos I of Cyprus|Chrysostomos I]] attended the re-opening of the Danilov Monastery and celebrated with the [[Divine Liturgy]].

=== Local Council and Honouring of Saints ===
June 6 in the [[Trinity-Sergius Lavra]] opened the [[1988 Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church|Local Council]], which lasted until June 9. Local Council was honoured as the saints [[Dmitry Donskoy]], [[Andrei Rublev]], [[Maximus the Greek]], [[Macarius, Metropolitan of Moscow|Metropolitan Macarius of Moscow]], [[Paisius Velichkovsky]], [[Xenia of Saint Petersburg]], [[Ignatius Bryanchaninov]], [[Ambrose of Optina]] and [[Theophan the Recluse]]. At the council also (for the first time since Sobor 1917-1918) discussed many topical issues of church life.

===Other festivities===
A gala concert was performed at the [[Bolshoi Theatre|Bolshoi]]. Many activities were broadcast on [[Television in the Soviet Union|national television]]. Celebrations took place in Moscow, [[Leningrad]], [[Novgorod]], [[Kiev]], [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], [[Minsk]] and in all the [[Eparchies of the Russian Orthodox Church]]. A commemorative 25 [[ruble]] coin featuring the monument of Volodymyr the great was minted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.museum-of-money.org/view/1000th_anniversary_of_christianity_in_russia/ "Volodymyr the Great"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231805/http://en.museum-of-money.org/view/1000th_anniversary_of_christianity_in_russia/ |date=2013-12-02 }} Museum of Money, Feodosia. 2013. Accessed 23 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; An open competition for the design of a new church to commemorate the anniversary was held by the Moscow Patriarchate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GtooAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=1000th+anniversary+of+christianization+of+rus&amp;dq=1000th+anniversary+of+christianization+of+rus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AGeQUqO-DcSlkQXsyoC4BA&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBw "The Current Digest of the Soviet Press, Volume 41, Issues 14-26."] American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies, 1989 University of Minnesota. Accessed at Google Books snippet view. 23 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boycott by Constantinople==
The [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]], [[Patriarch Demetrios I of Constantinople|Dimitrios I]] boycotted the event because of a disagreement over protocol. Instead, on February 28, 1988, [[Sunday of Orthodoxy]], a delegation from Russia, led by Archbishop [[Kirill I of Moscow|Kirill]] of Smolensk and Viazma visited [[Constantinople|Istanbul]].

==Awards==
On June 3, 1988, by decree of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]], Patriarch Pimen, Metropolitan of Kiev [[Philaret (Denisenko)]], Metropolitan [[Alexis II of Moscow|Alexius (Ridiger)]] of Leningrad, Archbishop [[Nicholas (Kutepov)]] of Gorky and Archbishop [[Alexander (Timofeyev)]] of Dmitrov were awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labor]]. Other Bishops were awarded the [[Order of Friendship of Peoples]].

Fadlo had studied at what later became the [[American University of Beirut]] and settled in Manchester as a cotton merchant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marmura|first1=Michael E.|title=Islamic Theology and Philosophy: Studies in Honor of George F. Hourani|date=1984|publisher=SUNY|location=New York|page=Introduction|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albert's brothers were [[George Hourani]], philosopher, historian, and classicist, and [[Cecil Hourani]], economic adviser to [[List of Presidents of Tunisia|President of Tunisia]] [[Habib Bourguiba]]. His family had converted from [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] to [[Church of Scotland|Scottish Presbyterianism]] and his father became an elder of the local church in Manchester. Hourani himself, in turn, [[Conversion to Christianity#Conversions.2Ftransfers to another Christian denomination|converted to Catholicism]] in adulthood. Fadlo had extensive business contacts with the Levantine community both in Manchester and in the Ottoman Empire, and Cecil Hourani commented on the household's mixed Anglo-Levantine culture:

''"... to my earliest memories in Manchester there were two faces: the one Near Eastern, Lebanese, full of poetry, politics, and business; the other partly Scottish Presbyterian, full of Sunday church-going and Sunday school, partly English through an English nanny and a succession of English and Irish cooks and maids."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=irtb55WDsjMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=history+of+the+arab+peoples+albert+hourani+presbyterian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-wera4MLeAhVGiCwKHYj9AcUQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=presbyterian&amp;f=false|title=A History of the Arab Peoples: Updated Edition|last=Hourani|first=Albert|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|isbn=9780571302499|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fadlo Hourani tried to enroll Albert into a [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]] in Manchester but it did not accept him as it did not take 'foreigners'; Fadlo instead opened an [[alternative school]] in which Albert studied until the age of fourteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://digirep.rhul.ac.uk/items/868a4006-2640-06b0-4ed4-cfce4279b814/1/Mohammed_Seddon.Muslim_and_Jewish_Communities_in_19C_Manchester.pdf |last=Seddon |first=Mohammad Siddique |title=Muslim and Jewish Communities in Nineteenth Century Manchester |publisher=[[Royal Holloway, University of London]] }}{{dead link|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later studied at [[Mill Hill School]], London&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''{{clarify|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; before attending [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], where he studied [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics|Philosophy, Politics, Economics and History]] (with an emphasis on [[international relations]] in the politics section of the degree), graduating [[first class degree|first in his class]] in 1936.

==Career==
He taught in 1938–39 at the [[American University in Beirut]], the first time he had lived in an Arabic speaking country&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Al-Sudairi|first1=Abdulaziz|title=A Vision of the Middle East: An Intellectual Biography of Albert Hourani|date=1991|publisher=I.B.Tauris|page=21|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[World War II]] he worked at the [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]] (aka Chatham House) and in the office of the British [[Minister of State]] in [[Cairo]]. After the war's end, he worked at the Arab Office in [[Jerusalem]] and London, where he helped prepare the Arab case for the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]].

He began his academic career, which would occupy the rest of his life, in 1948, teaching at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]], [[St Antony's College, Oxford|St. Antony's College]] (where he created and directed the college's Middle East Centre), the [[American University of Beirut]], the University of Chicago, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard. He ended his academic career as Fellow of St. Antony's and Reader in the History of the Modern Middle East at Oxford. Hourani trained more academic historians of the modern Middle East than any other university historian of his generation. Today his students can be found on the faculties of LSE, Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Yale, University of Pennsylvania, Columbia, MIT and the University of Haifa, among others.
He was appointed CBE in the [[1980 Birthday Honours]].

==Influence on Middle Eastern studies==
Hourani's most popular work is ''[[History of the Arab Peoples|A History of the Arab Peoples]]'' (1991), a readable introduction to the [[history of the Middle East]] and an international best seller. ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age 1789–1939'' (1962) is one of the first scientific attempts at a comprehensive analysis of the ''[[nahda]]'', the Arab revival of the 19th century, and the opening of the Arab world to modern European culture; it remains one of the major works on this subject. ''Syria and Lebanon'' (1946) and ''Minorities in the Arab World'' (1947) are other major works. He also wrote extensive works on the [[orientalism|orientalist]] perspective on Middle Eastern cultures through the 18th and 19th centuries, and he developed the influential concept of the "[[urban notables]]" – political and social elites in provincial Middle Eastern cities and towns that served as intermediaries between imperial capitals (such as [[History of Istanbul#Ottoman Empire|Istanbul under the Ottoman Turks]]) and provincial society.

The top book prize in the [[Middle Eastern studies]] field is named the [[Albert Hourani Book Award]] and it is given annually by the [[Middle East Studies Association of North America]] (MESA). Hourani was an Honorary Fellow of both MESA and the [[American Historical Association]] (AHA).

==Personal life==
[[File:WolvercoteCemetery HouraniAlbert.jpg|thumb|upright|Hourani's headstone in [[Wolvercote Cemetery]], Oxford]]
In 1955 Hourani married Christine Mary Odile Wegg-Prosser (born 1914), while teaching at Magdalen College, Oxford. He died in Oxford at the age of 77. His widow died in 2003. Both are buried in [[Wolvercote Cemetery]] in Oxford.

They had a daughter, Susanna Hourani, who became professor of [[pharmacology]] and Head of Department in the School of [[Biomedical sciences|Biomedical]] and [[Molecular physics|Molecular Sciences]] of the [[University of Surrey]].

'''Anders Winroth''' (born 1965 in [[Ludvika]] in [[Sweden]]) is a professor of medieval history at [[Yale University]].
==Life==
After graduation from [[Stockholm University]], Winroth did his master's and doctoral studies at [[Columbia University]] under [[Robert Somerville]], followed by [[postdoctoral research]] at the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle]], where he was the [[Sir_James_Knott,_1st_Baronet|Sir James Knott]] Research Fellow and worked with [[R. I. Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anders Winroth {{!}} Department of History|url=http://history.yale.edu/people/anders-winroth|publisher=Yale University}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Professor Winroth specializes in the history  of "medieval Europe, especially religious, intellectual and legal history as well as the Viking Age. He teaches both halves of the survey lecture course in medieval history, seminars in religious, legal, intellectual, and Scandinavian history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anders Winroth {{!}} Department of History|url=http://history.yale.edu/people/anders-winroth|publisher=Yale University}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He worked on the [[Decretum Gratiani|Decretum]] of [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]] and discovered that the original version, the so-called "first recension," was only about half the size of the commonly known text. Winroth also has a strong interest in Swedish genealogy.

Winroth was a [[MacArthur Fellows Program#2003|2003 MacArthur Fellow]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24397">The '''archaeology of religion and ritual''' is a growing field of study within [[archaeology]] that applies ideas from [[religious studies]],  theory and methods, anthropological theory, and archaeological and [[historical method]]s and theories to the study of [[religion]] and [[ritual]] in past human societies from a material perspective.

==Definitions==

Religion may be defined as “a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe, especially when considered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies, usually involving devotional and ritual observances, and often containing a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs,” &lt;ref name=dict&gt;Dictionary.com (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Religion) Based on the Random House Dictionary, Random House, Inc. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; whereas ritual is “an established or prescribed procedure for a religious or other rite.” &lt;ref&gt;Dictionary.com (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ritual) Based on the Random House Dictionary, Random House, Inc. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists may study the material traces of religious ritual (for example, the ritual destruction of ceramic vessels during the [[Aztec]] [[New Fire ceremony]] &lt;ref&gt;Elson, Christina and Michael E. Smith (2001) Archaeological Deposits from the Aztec New Fire Ceremony.  ‘’Ancient Mesoamerica, ‘’ Vol. 12, Issue 2, pp. 157–174&lt;/ref&gt;) or the material correlates of religion as a totalized worldview (for example, Elizabeth Kyder-Reid’s study of the Southern [[Redemptorist]]s’ reconfiguration of landscape and artifacts to reflect their ideals of community and poverty in material form &lt;ref&gt;Kyder-Reid, Elizabeth (1996)  The Construction of Sanctity: Landscape and Ritual in a Religious Community.  In ‘’Landscape Archaeology: Reading and Interpreting the American Historical Landscape.’’  Rebecca Yamin and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds.  University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

As in [[religious studies]] and the [[Anthropology of religion]], many archaeologists differentiate between “[[world religions]],” and “traditional” or “[[indigenous religions]].”  “World religions” are defined by Bowie (2000: 26) &lt;ref name="Bowie"&gt;Bowie, F.  (2000) The Anthropology of religion.  Oxford: Blackwell.  Quoted in Insoll, Timothy (2004) ‘’Archaeology, Religion, Ritual.’’  New York: Routeledge, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; as:

# Based on written scriptures.
# Has a notion of salvation, often from outside.
# Universal, or potentially universal.
# Can subsume or supplant primal religions.
# Often forms a separate sphere of activity.

while indigenous religions are defined as:

# Oral, or if literate, lacks written/formal scriptures and creeds.
# ‘This worldly’.
#  Confined to a single language or ethnic group.
#  Form basis from which world religions have developed.
#  Religious and social life are inseparable.&lt;ref name="Bowie"/&gt;

However, Timothy Insoll (2004: 9) &lt;ref&gt;Insoll, Timothy (2004) ‘’Archaeology, Religion, Ritual.’’  New York: Routeledge&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that these categorizations arise from a much-critiqued [[neo-evolutionism|neo-evolutionary]] perspective.  Strict dichotomies of religious forms may also contribute to skewing research toward state religions, leaving [[household]] religious practice, and the relationships between these, under-investigated (a trend noted by Elson and Smith, 2001 &lt;ref&gt;Elson, Christina and Michael E. Smith (2001:157) Archaeological Deposits from the Aztec New Fire Ceremony.  Ancient Mesoamerica, Vol. 12, Issue 2, pp. 157–174&lt;/ref&gt;).  Insoll (2004:9) argues that archaeologists may contribute to blurring the boundaries of world and indigenous religions.

The archaeology of religion also incorporates related anthropological or religious concepts and terms such as [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[tradition]], [[religious symbolism|symbolism]], and the [[sacred]].

==Theory==

===Anthropology of religion===

Theory within the archaeology of religion borrows heavily from the [[Anthropology of religion]], which encompasses a broad range of perspectives.  These include: [[Émile Durkheim]]’s functionalist understanding of religion as serving to separate the [[Sacred-profane dichotomy|sacred and the profane]];&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile. (1998)  ''The Elementary Forms of Religious Life.’’  Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]]’s idea of religion as “[[the opium of the people|the opium of the masses]]” or a [[false consciousness]],&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl (1992) ‘’Early Writings.’’  Penguin Classics.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clifford Geertz]]’s loose definition of religion as a “system of symbols” that orders the world,&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Clifford (1973:90) ''The Interpretation of Cultures.’’  New York: Basic Books.  P. 90&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Turner]]’s work on ritual, including [[rites of passage]] and [[liminality]],&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Victor (1995) ''The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure.’’  Aldine Transaction.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Weber]]’s religious types &lt;ref&gt;Heydebrand, Wolf (1994) ‘’Sociological Writings: Max Weber.’’  Continuum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and thoughts on the relationship between economics and religion;&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max (2002) ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism: and Other Writings.''  Trans. Peter Baehr.  Penguin Classics.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]’ structuralist understandings of [[totemism]] and [[myth]];&lt;ref&gt;Tremlett, Paul-François (2008) ‘’Lévi-Strauss on Religion: The Structuring Mind (Key Thinkers in the Study of Religion’’).  Equionox Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mary Douglas]]’ idea of the division of “[[Purity and Danger|purity and danger]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Mary (2003 [1966]) ''Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concept of Pullution and Taboo.''  Routledge Classics&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion, identity, and practice===

Archaeological studies of religion increasingly recognize religion as an organizing principle in social life, rather than as a separate sphere of activity.  They include religion as an axis of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] that structures social life and personal experience.  Therefore, entire artifact assemblages (rather than specifically “religious” artifacts, such as rosary beads) can be interpreted according to the ways that they simultaneously create, display, and constrain notions of self according to religious ideas.  For example, John Chenoweth (2009) &lt;ref name="Chenoweth, John M. 2009"&gt;Chenoweth, John M.  (2009)  Social identity, material culture, and the archaeology of religion: Quaker practices in context.  ''Journal of Social Archaeology'' 9: 319&lt;/ref&gt; interpreted ceramic assemblages and burials according to [[Quaker]] ideals of plainness and modesty.

Because social identity is both imposed and negotiated through social practice, including material practice, archaeologies of religion increasingly incorporate practice-based theory.  Building upon [[Anthony Giddens]]’ idea of structuration &lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1986) ‘’The Constitution of Society: Outline of A Theory of Structuration.’’  Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]’s ideas of both practice &lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre (1977) ‘’Outline of a Theory of Practice.’’  Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and cultural capital,&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre (1987) ‘’Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste.’’  Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; theories of material practice posit that people use material goods to negotiate their places within social structures.  Examples of the archaeological interpretation of religion and ritual as part of social negotiation, transformation or reinforcement include Chenoweth’s work on [[Quaker]] religious practice,&lt;ref name="Chenoweth, John M. 2009"/&gt; Kyder-Reid’s work on the Southern Redemptorists,&lt;ref&gt;Kyder-Reid, Elizabeth (1996)  The Construction of Sanctity: Landscape and Ritual in a Religious Community.  In ''Landscape Archaeology: Reading and Interpreting the American Historical Landscape.''  Rebecca Yamin and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds.  University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Timothy Pauketat’s work on feasting in [[Cahokia]] (Pauketat et al., 2002 &lt;ref&gt;Pauketat, Timothy, Lucretia S. Kelly, Gayle J. Fritz, Neal H. Lopinot, Scott Elias, and Eve Hargrave (2002) The Residues of Feasting and Public Ritual at Cahokia.  ''American Antiquity,'' Vol. 67, No. 2, pp. 257–279&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Religion, power, and inequality===

Because religion and political power are often intertwined&lt;ref&gt;Firth, Raymond (1981) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/676754 Spiritual Aroma: Religion and Politics].

State University of New York Press (August 13, 1991) {{ISBN|978-0791406519}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in early states, the archaeology of religion may also engage theories of [[power (philosophy)|power]] and [[Social inequality|inequality]].   John Janusek’s study of [[Tiwanaku]] religion, for example, explored the ways that religion served to integrate societies within the Andean state.&lt;ref&gt;Janusek, John Wayne (2006) The changing ‘nature’ of Tiwanaku religion and the rise of the Andean state.  ''World Archaeology'' Vol. 38(3): 469–492&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Colonialism|Colonial]] regimes frequently justified expansion through a commitment to religious conversion; archaeologies of coloniality may therefore intersect with the archaeology of religion.

''American Anthropologist'' 110(2): 191–203&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrate how religion has intersected with colonial regimes.

===Historical method and theory===

Historical archaeologists have made major contributions to the understanding of the religion and ritual of peoples who have remained underrepresented (or misrepresented) in the historical record, such as colonized peoples, indigenous peoples, and enslaved peoples.  Mandatory religious conversion was common in many colonial situations (e.g. the Spanish colonization of the Americas), which led to syncretic religious practice, rejection or resistance to new religions, covert practice of indigenous religions, and/or misunderstandings and misinterpretations of both indigenous and colonizer religions (Hanks 2010 &lt;ref&gt;Hanks, William F. (2010).  ''Converting Words: Maya in the Age of the Cross''.  Berkeley: University of California Press,&lt;/ref&gt; Klor de Alva 1982,&lt;ref&gt;Klor de Alva, J. Jorge (1982).  Spiritual Conflict and Accommodation in New Spain: Toward a Typology of Aztec Responses to Christianity.  In George A. Collier, Renato Rosaldo, and John D. Wirth (eds), ''The Inca and Aztec States, 1400–1800: Anthropology and History.''  New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; Wernke 2007&lt;ref name="Wernke, Steven 2007"&gt;Wernke, Steven (2007)  Analogy or Erasure?  Dialectics of Religious Transformation in the Early Doctrinas of the Colca Valley, Peru.  ''International Journal of Historical Archaeology'', Vol. 11, No. 2, June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;).

This research combines archaeological and anthropological method and theory with historical method and theory.  In addition to recovering, recording, and analyzing material culture, historical archaeologists use archives, oral histories, ethnohistorical accounts.  Researchers read texts critically, emphasizing the historical context of the documents (especially regarding underrepresented peoples whose voices may be distorted or missing) in order to better understand religious practices that may have been discouraged or even severely punished.  Combined archaeological, historical, and anthropological data sets may contradict each other, or the material record may illuminate the details of covert or syncretic religious practice, as well as resistance to dominant religious forms. For example, our understanding of the religious practice of enslaved peoples in the United States (e.g. Leone and Frye 2001,&lt;ref name="Leone, Mark P 2001"&gt;Leone, Mark P. and Gladys Marie Frye (2001) A Coherent Religion among African Slaves.  In ''Race and the Archaeology of Identity'', ed. By C. Orser.  University of Utah Press&lt;/ref&gt; Fennell 2007 &lt;ref name="Fennell, Christopher 2007"&gt;Fennell, Christopher (2007) ''Crossroads and Cosmologies: Diasporas and Ethnogenesis in the New World''.  University of Florida Press,&lt;/ref&gt;) has increased dramatically thanks to research in historical archaeology.

== Material correlates==

Because archaeology studies human history through objects, buildings, bodies, and spaces, archaeologists must engage theories that connect anthropological and sociological theories of religion to [[material culture]] and landscapes. Theories of materiality &lt;ref&gt;Meskell, Lynn (2005) ''Archaeologies of Materiality.''  Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; and landscape &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Matthew (2006) ''Ideas of Landscape.'' Wiley-Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; serve to connect human activities, experiences, and behaviors to social practices, including religion.  Theories of [[:wikt:embody|embodiment]] &lt;ref&gt;Hammelkis, Yannis, Mark Pluciennik, and Sarah Tarlow (eds) (2001) ''Thinking Through the Body: Archaeologies of Corporeality.''  Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; also serve to interpret human remains as they relate to religion and ritual.

The archaeology of religion makes use of the same material evidence as other branches of archaeology, but certain artifact classes are particularly emphasized in studying religion and ritual in the past:

*'''Human remains and [[burial]] assemblages''' can offer many clues to religious and ritual activity.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Christopher (1995) Mortuary Practices: Their Social, Philosophical-Religious, Circumstantial, and Physical Determinants.  ''Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory'', Vol. 2, No. 2, pp. 105–200&lt;/ref&gt;  Human remains themselves are used in all branches of archaeology for information on sex, age, occupation, and disease.  Methods of interment (including burial position, cremation, burial location, primary and secondary burials, etc.) contribute to understanding changing religious practice, as well as social difference within groups (e.g. Lohmann 2005 &lt;ref&gt;Lohmann, Roger Ivar (2005) The Afterlife of Asabano Corpses: Relationships with the Deceased in Papua New Guinea.  ''Ethnology,'' Vol. 44, No. 2, pp. 189–206&lt;/ref&gt;).  Total burial contexts, i.e., the setting, [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[ecofacts]], and human remains themselves, may provide evidence of religious beliefs about [[death]] and the afterworld.
*'''Religious buildings''', such as [[temple]] complexes, [[kivas]], and missions, are often used to examine communal religious and ritual activity (e.g. Barnes 1995,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Gina L. (1995) An Introduction to Buddhist Archaeology.  ‘’World Archaeology,’’ Vol. 27, No. 2, pp. 165–182&lt;/ref&gt; Graham 1998,&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Elizabeth (1998) Mission Archaeology.  ‘’Annual Review of Anthropology’’, Vol. 27, pp. 25–62&lt;/ref&gt; Reid ''et al.'' 1997 &lt;ref&gt;Reid, Andrew, Paul Lane, Alinah Segobye, Lowe Borjeson, Nonofo Mathibidi, and Princess Sekgarametso (1997) Tswana Architecture and Responses to Colonialism.  ''World Archaeology,'' Vol. 28, No. 3, pp. 370–392&lt;/ref&gt; ).  Part of [[archaeoastronomy]] is the investigation of how buildings are aligned to astral bodies and events, such as solstices, which often coincide with religious or ritual activities.  Archaeological examinations of religious buildings can reveal unequal access to religious knowledge and ritual.  Religious buildings frequently contain religious iconography that provides insight into the symbolic dimensions of religious life.
*Within landscape archaeology, '''sacred [[landscapes]]''' are an increasingly important focus of study (e.g. Clendinnen 1980 &lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen, Inga  (1980) Landscape and Worldview: The Survival of Yucatec Maya Culture under Spanish Conquest.  ''Comparative Studies in Society and History,'' Vol. 22, No. 3, pp. 374–393
&lt;/ref&gt;). Landscapes are imbued with sacred meaning throughout the world; [[aboriginal Australian]] [[songlines]], and the related belief that mythical events are marked on the landscape, are one example.  Human modifications to landscapes, such as Kyder-Reid’s study of the Redemtorists’ modifications of their estate to emphasize communality,&lt;ref&gt;Kyder-Reid, Elizabeth (1996)  The Construction of Sanctity: Landscape and Ritual in a Religious Community.  In ''Landscape Archaeology: Reading and Interpreting the American Historical Landscape. '' Rebecca Yamin and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds.  University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt; may point to the enactment of religious views.

*'''Religious iconography, [[symbols]]''',&lt;ref&gt;Robb, John E. (1998) The Archaeology of Symbols.  ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', Vol. 27, pp. 329–346&lt;/ref&gt; '''ethnographic texts and ethnographic analogy''' are important tools that archaeologists use to compare with the material record to examine religions in the past (e.g. Clendinnen 1980,&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen, Inga  (1980) Landscape and Worldview: The Survival of Yucatec Maya Culture under Spanish Conquest. ‘’ Comparative Studies in Society and History,’’ Vol. 22, No. 3, pp. 374–393&lt;/ref&gt; Elson and Smith 2001 &lt;ref&gt;Elson, Christina and Michael E. Smith (2001:157) Archaeological Deposits from the Aztec New Fire Ceremony.  ''Ancient Mesoamerica,'' Vol. 12, Issue 2, pp. 157–174&lt;/ref&gt;). Though texts are not direct “windows to the past,” particularly for societies with few or no written records, they are valuable lines of evidence that may be contradicted or supported by the material record.
*'''Common artifact classes''' such as [[ceramic art|ceramics]] have been increasingly reinterpreted within a religious framework. According to the idea of religion as a form of social practice and a total worldview, any artifact may potentially be used to embody religious ideas and ideals in material form.  Patterns of artifact and [[ecofact]] use within ritual contexts may expose preferences or sacred meanings of certain materials; the ritual use of [[pine]] among the ancient Maya is one example (Morehart, Lentz, and Prufer 2005 &lt;ref&gt;Morehart, Christopher T., David L. Lentz, and Keith M. Prufer (2005)  Wood of the Gods: The Ritual Use of Pine (PINUS SPP.) by the Ancient Lowland Maya.  ''Latin American Antiquity'’, 16(3), pp. 255–274&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Modern religious use of archaeological sites===
Contemporary religious groups often claim archaeological sites as part of their heritage, and make use of archaeological sites and artifacts in their religious practice (e.g. Wallis 2003 &lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Robert J. and Jenny Blain (2003) Sites, Sacredness, and Stories: Interactions of Archaeology and Contemporary Paganism.  ‘’Folklore’’, Vol. 114, No. 3, pp. 307–321&lt;/ref&gt;).  These practices and religious interpretations of sites may clash with archaeological interpretations, leading to disputes about heritage, preservation, use of sites, and the “ownership” of history (Bender 1999 &lt;ref&gt;Bender, Barbara (1999) ‘’Stonehenge: Making Space’’.

Biblical archaeology is a field of archaeology that seeks to correlate events in the Bible with concrete archaeological sites and artifacts (Meyers 1984,&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, Eric M.

The '''architecture of Mesopotamia''' is ancient architecture of the region of the Tigris–Euphrates river system (also known as [[Mesopotamia]]), encompassing several distinct cultures and spanning a period from the 10th millennium BC, when the first permanent structures were built, to the 6th century BC. Among the Mesopotamian architectural accomplishments are the development of [[urban planning]], the [[courtyard house]], and [[ziggurat]]s. No architectural profession existed in Mesopotamia; however, scribes drafted and managed construction for the government, nobility, or royalty.

==Building materials==
Sumerian masonry was usually mortarless although [[bitumen]] was sometimes used. Brick styles, which varied greatly over time, are categorized by period.&lt;ref&gt;Harmansah, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

*Patzen 80×40×15&amp;nbsp;cm: Late [[Uruk period]] (3600&amp;ndash;3200 BC)
*Riemchen 16×16&amp;nbsp;cm: Late [[Uruk period]] (3600&amp;ndash;3200 BC)
*Plano-convex 10x19x34 cm: [[Early Dynastic Period of Sumer|Early Dynastic Period]] (3100&amp;ndash;2300 BC)

The favored design was rounded bricks, which are somewhat unstable, so Mesopotamian bricklayers would lay a row of bricks perpendicular to the rest every few rows. The advantages to plano-convex bricks were the speed of manufacture as well as the irregular surface which held the finishing plaster coat better than a smooth surface from other brick types.

Bricks were sun baked to harden them. These types of bricks are much less durable than oven-baked ones so buildings eventually deteriorated. They were periodically destroyed, leveled, and rebuilt on the same spot. This planned structural life cycle gradually raised the level of cities, so that they came to be elevated above the surrounding plain. The resulting mounds are known as [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]s, and are found throughout the ancient Near East. Civic buildings slowed decay by using cones of colored stone, terracotta panels, and [[clay nail]]s driven into the adobe-brick to create a protective sheath that decorated the façade. Specially prized were imported building materials such as cedar from [[Lebanon]], [[diorite]] from [[Arabia]], and [[lapis lazuli]] from [[India]].

Babylonian temples are massive structures of crude brick, supported by [[buttress]]es, the rain being carried off by drains. One such drain at [[Ur]] was made of lead. The use of brick led to the early development of the [[pilaster]] and column, and of [[fresco]]es and enamelled tiles. The walls were brilliantly colored, and sometimes plated with [[zinc]] or gold, as well as with tiles. Painted ''[[terra-cotta]]'' cones for torches were also embedded in the plaster. Assyria, imitating Babylonian architecture, also built its palaces and temples of brick, even when stone was the natural building material of the country&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; faithfully preserving the brick platform, necessary in the marshy soil of Babylonia, but little needed in the north.

[[File:Human headed winged bull facing.jpg|thumb|right|An Assyrian [[lamassu]], [[Bas-relief]] c. 713–716 BC]]
As time went on, however, later Assyrian architects began to shake themselves free of Babylonian influence, and to use stone as well as brick. The walls of Assyrian palaces were lined with sculptured and coloured slabs of stone, instead of being painted as in [[Chaldea]]. Three stages may be traced in the art of these ''bas-reliefs'': it is vigorous but simple under [[Ashurnasirpal II]], careful and realistic under [[Sargon II]], and refined but wanting in boldness under [[Ashurbanipal]].

In Babylonia, in place of the ''bas relief'', there is greater use of three-dimensional figures in the round&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the earliest examples being the statues from [[Girsu]], that are realistic if somewhat clumsy. The paucity of stone in Babylonia made every pebble precious, and led to a high perfection in the art of gem-cutting. Two seal-cylinders from the age of [[Sargon of Akkad]] are among the best examples of their kind. One of the first remarkable specimens of early [[metallurgy]] to be discovered by archaeologists is the silver vase of [[Entemena]]. At a later epoch, great excellence was attained in the manufacture of such jewellery as earrings and bracelets of gold. Copper, too, was worked with skill; indeed, it is possible that Babylonia was the original home of copper-working.

The people were famous at an early date for their embroideries and rugs. The forms of Assyrian pottery are graceful; the porcelain, like the glass discovered in the palaces of [[Nineveh]], was derived from Egyptian models. Transparent glass seems to have been first introduced in the reign of Sargon. Stone, clay and glass were used to make vases, and vases of hard stone have been dug up at Girsu similar to those of the early dynastic period of Egypt.

The study of ancient Mesopotamian architecture is based on available [[archaeological]] evidence, pictorial representation of buildings, and texts on building practices. According to [[Archibald Sayce]], the primitive pictograms of the [[Uruk period]] era suggest that "Stone was scarce, but was already cut into blocks and seals. Brick was the ordinary building material, and with it cities, forts, temples and houses were constructed. The city was provided with towers and stood on an artificial platform; the house also had a tower-like appearance. It was provided with a door which turned on a hinge, and could be opened with a sort of key; the city gate was on a larger scale, and seems to have been double. ... Demons were feared who had wings like a bird, and the foundation stones&amp;nbsp;– or rather bricks&amp;nbsp;– of a house were consecrated by certain objects that were deposited under them."&lt;ref name="Sayce"&gt;[[Archibald Sayce|Sayce, Rev. A. H.]], Professor of Assyriology, Oxford, [https://archive.org/stream/archaeologyofcun00sayc/archaeologyofcun00sayc_djvu.txt "The Archaeology of the Cuneiform Inscriptions"], Second Edition-revised, 1908, Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, London, Brighton, New York; at pages 98–100 [https://archive.org/details/archaeologyofcun00sayc Not in copyright]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholarly literature usually concentrates on the architecture of temples, palaces, city walls and gates, and other monumental buildings, but occasionally one finds works on residential architecture as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Sally|last=Dunham|chapter=Ancient Near Eastern architecture|title=A Companion to the Ancient Near East|editor=Daniel Snell|location=Oxford|publisher=Blackwell|year=2005|pages=266–280|isbn=0-631-23293-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological surface surveys also allowed for the study of urban form in early Mesopotamian cities.

==Urban planning==
{{Main|Urban history}}
The Sumerians were the first society to construct the city itself as a built form. They were proud of this achievement as attested in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] which opens with a description of [[Uruk]]—its walls, streets, markets, temples, and gardens. Uruk itself is significant as the center of an urban culture which both colonized and urbanized western Asia.

The construction of cities was the end product of trends which began in the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. The growth of the city was partly planned and partly organic. Planning is evident in the walls, high temple district, main canal with harbor, and main street. The finer structure of residential and commercial spaces is the reaction of economic forces to the spatial limits imposed by the planned areas resulting in an irregular design with regular features. Because the Sumerians recorded real estate transactions it is possible to reconstruct much of the urban growth pattern, density, property value, and other metrics from cuneiform text sources.

The typical city divided space into residential, mixed use, commercial, and civic spaces. The residential areas were grouped by profession.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 2004, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; At the core of the city was a high temple complex always sited slightly off of the geographical center. This high temple usually predated the founding of the city and was the nucleus around which the urban form grew. The districts adjacent to gates had a special religious and economic function.

The city always included a belt of irrigated agricultural land including small hamlets. A network of roads and canals connected the city to this land. The transportation network was organized in three tiers: wide processional streets (Akkadian:''sūqu ilāni u šarri''), public through streets (Akkadian:''sūqu nišī''), and private blind alleys (Akkadian:''mūṣû''). The public streets that defined a block varied little over time while the blind-alleys were much more fluid. The current estimate is 10% of the city area was streets and 90% buildings.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2009"&gt;Baker, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The canals; however, were more important than roads for good transportation.

==Houses==
The materials used to build a Mesopotamian house were similar but not exact as those used today: mud brick, mud plaster and wooden doors, which were all naturally available around the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Nicholas Postgate, J N Postgate|title=Early Mesopotamia: Society and Economy at the Dawn of History|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; although wood was not common in some cities of Sumer. Most houses had a square center room with other rooms attached to it, but a great variation in the size and materials used to build the houses suggest they were built by the inhabitants themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/282/5393/1442 |title=The first cities: Why Settle Down? The Mystery of Communities  |doi=10.1126/science.282.5393.1442 |accessdate=2010-04-17 |volume=282 |journal=Science |page=1442}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smallest rooms may not have coincided with the poorest people; in fact, it could be that the poorest people built houses out of perishable materials such as reeds on the outside of the city, but there is very little direct evidence for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Susan Pollock|title=Ancient Mesopotamia|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residential design was a direct development from [[Ubaid house]]s. Although Sumerian [[cylinder seal]]s depict [[Mudhif|reed house]]s, the [[courtyard house]] was the predominant typology, which has been used in Mesopotamia to the present day. This house called ''[[É (temple)|é]]'' ([[Cuneiform]]: {{cuneiform|&amp;#x1208D;}}, {{transl|Xsux|E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}; [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]: e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; {{lang-akk|bītu}}) faced inward toward an open courtyard which provided a cooling effect by creating convection currents. This courtyard called ''tarbaṣu'' (Akkadian) was the primary organizing feature of the house, all the rooms opened into it. The external walls were featureless with only a single opening connecting the house to the street. Movement between the house and street required a 90° turn through a small antechamber. From the street only the rear wall of the antechamber would be visible through an open door, likewise there was no view of the street from the courtyard. The Sumerians had a strict division of public and private spaces. The typical size for a Sumerian house was 90 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2009"/&gt;

==Palace==
The [[palace]] came into existence during the Early Dynastic I period. From a rather modest beginning the palace grows in size and complexity as power is increasingly centralized. The palace is called a 'Big House' (Cuneiform: E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.GAL Sumerian e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-gal Akkdian: ''ekallu'') where the [[lugal]] or [[Ensí|ensi]] lived and worked.

The palaces of the early Mesopotamian elites were large-scale complexes, and were often lavishly decorated. Earliest known examples are from the [[Diyala River]] valley sites such as Khafajah and Tell Asmar. These third millennium BC palaces functioned as large-scale socio-economic institutions, and therefore, along with residential and private functions, they housed craftsmen workshops, food storehouses, ceremonial courtyards, and are often associated with shrines. For instance, the so-called "giparu" (or Gig-Par-Ku in Sumerian) at Ur where the Moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]]'s priestesses resided was a major complex with multiple courtyards, a number of sanctuaries, burial chambers for dead priestesses, and a ceremonial banquet hall. A similarly complex example of a Mesopotamian palace was excavated at [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in [[Syria]], dating from the [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian]] period.

Assyrian palaces of the Iron Age, especially at Kalhu/[[Nimrud]], Dur Sharrukin/[[Khorsabad]] and Ninuwa/[[Nineveh]], have become famous due to the [[Assyrian palace reliefs]], extensive pictorial and textual narrative programs on their walls, all carved on stone slabs known as [[orthostat]]s. These pictorial programs either incorporated cultic scenes or the narrative accounts of the kings' military and civic accomplishments. Gates and important passageways were flanked with massive stone sculptures of apotropaic mythological figures, ''[[lamassu]]'' and [[winged genie]]s. The architectural arrangement of these Iron Age palaces were also organized around large and small courtyards. Usually the king's throne room opened to a massive ceremonial courtyard where important state councils met and state ceremonies were performed.

Massive amounts of [[Nimrud Ivories|ivory furniture pieces]] were found in some Assyrian palaces pointing to an intense trade relationship with North Syrian [[Neo-Hittite]] states at the time. Bronze repousse bands decorated the wooden gates of major buildings, but were mostly looted at the fall of the empire; the [[Balawat Gates]] are the principal survivors.

==Temples==
{{see|É (temple)}}
Temples often predated the creation of the urban settlement and grew from small one room structures to elaborate multiacre complexes across the 2,500 years of Sumerian history. Sumerian temples, fortifications, and palaces made use of more advanced materials and techniques, such as [[buttress]]es, [[wiktionary:recess|recesses]], and [[Column|half column]]s. Chronologically, Sumerian temples evolved from earlier [[Ubaid period|Ubaid]] temples. As the temple decayed it was ritually destroyed and a new temple built on its foundations. The successor temple was larger and more articulated than its predecessor temple. The evolution of the [[É (temple)|E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.abzu]] temple at [[Eridu]] is a frequently cited case-study of this process. Many temples had inscriptions engraved into them, such as the one at [[Tell Uqair]]. Palaces and city walls came much later after temples in the [[Early Dynastic Period of Sumer|Early Dynastic Period]].

The form of a Sumerian temple is manifestation of Near Eastern [[cosmology]], which described the world as a disc of land which was surrounded by a salt water ocean, both of which floated on another sea of fresh water called [[apsu]], above them was a hemispherical firmament which regulated time. A world mountain formed an [[axis mundi]] that joined all three layers. The role of the temple was to act as that axis mundi, a meeting place between gods and men.&lt;ref&gt;Mendenhall, 1983 p205-208&lt;/ref&gt; The sacredness of 'high places' as a meeting point between realms is a pre-Ubaid belief well attested in the Near East back the Neolithic age. The plan of the temple was rectangular with the corners pointing in cardinal directions to symbolize the four rivers which flow from the mountain to the four world regions. The orientation also serves a more practical purpose of using the temple roof as an observatory for Sumerian timekeeping. The temple was built on a low terrace of [[rammed earth]] meant to represent the sacred mound of primordial land which emerged from the water called dukug, 'pure mound' (Sumerian: du&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-ku&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Cuneiform:) during creation.

The doors of the long axis were the entry point for the gods, and the doors of the short axis the entry point for men. This configuration was called the bent axis approach, as anyone entering would make a ninety degree turn to face the cult statue at the end of the central hall. The bent axis approach is an innovation from the Ubaid temples which had a linear axis approach, and is also a feature of Sumerian houses. An offering table was located in the center of the temple at the intersection of the axes.

Temples of the Uruk Period divided the temple rectangle into tripartite, T-shaped, or combined plans. The tripartite plan inherited from the Ubaid had a large central hall with two smaller flanking halls on either side. The entry was along the short axis and the shrine was at the end of the long axis. The T-shaped plan, also from the Ubaid period, was identical to the tripartite plan except for a hall at one end of the rectangle perpendicular to the main hall. Temple C from the Eanna district of [[Uruk]] is a case-study of classical temple form.

There was an explosion of diversity in temple design during the following Early Dynastic Period. The temples still retained features such as cardinal orientation, rectangular plans, and buttresses. Now however they took on a variety new configurations including courtyards, walls, basins, and barracks. The [[É (temple)|Sin Temple]] in [[Khafajah]] is typical of this era, as it was designed around a series of courtyards leading to a [[cella]].

The high temple was a special type of temple that was home to the patron god of the city. Functionally, it served as a storage and distribution center as well as housing the priesthood. The [[É (temple)|White Temple]] of [[Anu]] in [[Uruk]] is typical of a high temple which was built very high on a platform of adobe-brick. In the Early Dynastic period high temples began to include a [[ziggurat]], a series of platforms creating a stepped pyramid. Such ziggurats may have been the inspiration for the Biblical [[Tower of Babel]].

===Ziggurats===

[[Ziggurat]]s were huge pyramidal temple towers which were first built in Sumerian City-States and then developed in Babylonia and Assyrian cities as well. There are 32 ziggurats known at, or near, Mesopotamia&amp;mdash;28 in [[Iraq]] and 4 in [[Iran]]. Notable ziggurats include the [[Great Ziggurat of Ur]] near [[Nasiriyah]], Iraq, the [[Ziggurat of Aqar Quf]] near [[Baghdad]], Iraq, [[Chogha Zanbil]] in [[Khūzestān Province|Khūzestān]], Iran (the most recent to be discovered), and the [[Tappeh Sialk|Sialk]] near [[Kashan]], Iran. Ziggurats were built by the [[Sumer]]ians, [[Babylon]]ians, [[Elam]]ites, and [[Assyria]]ns as monuments to local religions. The earliest examples of the ziggurat were raised platforms that date from the [[Ubaid period]]&lt;ref name="Crawford, page 73"&gt;Crawford, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; during the fourth [[millennium]] BC, and the latest date from the 6th century BC. The top of the ziggurat was flat, unlike many pyramids. The step pyramid style began near the end of the Early Dynastic Period.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, pp. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt;

Built in receding tiers upon a rectangular, oval, or square platform, the ziggurat was a [[pyramid]]al structure. Sun-baked bricks made up the core of the ziggurat with facings of fired bricks on the outside. The facings were often glazed in different colors and may have had [[astrology|astrological]] significance. Kings sometimes had their names engraved on these glazed bricks. The number of tiers ranged from two to seven, with a shrine or temple at the summit. Access to the shrine was provided by a series of ramps on one side of the ziggurat or by a spiral ramp from base to summit. It has been suggested that ziggurats were built to resemble mountains, but there is little textual or archaeological evidence to support that hypothesis.

Classical ziggurats emerged in the Neo-Sumerian Period with articulated buttresses, vitreous brick sheathing, and [[entasis]] in the elevation. The Ziggurat of Ur is the best example of this style. Another change in temple design in this period was a straight as opposed to bent-axis approach to the temple.

Ur-Nammu's ziggurat at Ur was designed as a three-stage construction, but today only two of these survive. This entire mudbrick core structure was originally given a facing of baked brick envelope set in [[bitumen]], 2.5&amp;nbsp;m on the first lowest stage, and 1.15&amp;nbsp;m on the second. Each of these baked bricks were stamped with the name of the king. The sloping walls of the stages were buttressed. The access to the top was by means of a triple monumental staircase, which all converges at a portal that opened on a landing between the first and second stages. The height of the first stage was about 11&amp;nbsp;m while the second stage rose some 5.7&amp;nbsp;m. Usually, a third stage is reconstructed by the excavator of the ziggurat ([[Leonard Woolley]]), and crowned by a temple. At the C[[Dur-Untash|hogha Zanbil]] ziggurat, archaeologists have found massive reed ropes that ran across the core of the ziggurat structure and tied together the mudbrick mass.

The most notable architectural remains from early Mesopotamia are the temple complexes at [[Uruk]] from the 4th millennium BC, temples and palaces from the [[Early Dynastic Period of Sumer#Early Dynastic period|Early Dynastic]] period sites in the [[Diyala River]] valley such as Khafajah and Tell Asmar, the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] remains at [[Nippur]] (Sanctuary of [[Enlil]]) and [[Ur]] (Sanctuary of [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]]), Middle [[Bronze Age]] remains at Syrian-Turkish sites of [[Ebla]], [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], [[Alalakh]], [[Aleppo]] and [[Kultepe]], Late Bronze Age palaces at [[Bogazkoy]] (Hattusha), [[Ugarit]], [[Ashur]] and [[Nuzi]], Iron Age palaces and temples at [[Assyria]]n ([[Kalhu]]/Nimrud, [[Khorsabad]], [[Nineveh]]), [[Babylonia]]n ([[Babylon]]), [[Urartian]] ([[Tushpa]]/Van, [[Haykaberd]], Ayanis, [[Armavir, Armenia|Armavir]], [[Erebuni Fortress|Erebuni]], [[Bastam]]) and [[Neo-Hittite]] sites ([[Carchemish|Karkamis]], [[Tell Halaf]], [[Karatepe]]). Houses are mostly known from Old Babylonian remains at Nippur and Ur. Among the textual sources on building construction and associated rituals are Gudea's cylinders from the late 3rd millennium are notable, as well as the Assyrian and Babylonian royal inscriptions from the [[Iron Age]].

==Design of Assyrian buildings, fortifications and temples==
[[File:Mesopotamia male worshiper 2750-2600 B.C.jpg|thumb|[[Tell Asmar]] "Standing man" votive sculpture 2750-2600 B.C]]
The plans of all the Assyrian buildings are rectangular, and we know that long ago, as now, the Eastern architects used this outline almost invariably, and upon it reared some of the most lovely and varied forms ever devised. They gather over the angles by graceful curves, and on the basis of an ordinary square hall carry up a minaret or a dome, an octagon or a circle. That this was sometimes done in Assyria is shown by the sculptures. Slabs from [[Kouyunjik]] show domes of varied form, and tower-like structures, each rising from a square base. The resemblance between the ancient form of the dome and those still used in the Assyrian villages is very striking. Whether sloping roofs were used is uncertain. Mr. Bonomi believes that they were, and a few sculptures seem to support his view. Of the private houses nothing, of course, remains; but they are represented on the slabs as being of several stories in height, the ground floor as usual having only a door and no windows. All have flat roofs, and we gather from one of the bas-reliefs, which represents a town on fire, that these roofs were made, just as they now are, with thick layers of earth on strong beams. These roofs are well-nigh fireproof, and the flames are represented as stopped by them, and coming out of the windows. No remains of a window, or, so far as we are aware, of an internal staircase, have been found.

Of the fortifications we know much more. In the north wall of Nimroud fifty-eight towers have been traced, and at [[Kouyunjik]] there are large remains of three walls, the lower part being of stone, and the upper of sun-dried bricks. At [[Khorsabad]] there are the remains of a wall, still {{convert|40|ft|m}} high, built of blocks of stone 3 to {{convert|4|ft|m}} thick, and the evidences wanting as to finishing of these is completely supplied by the sculptures, which show an extraordinary resemblance to medieval works of the same class. Tier upon tier of walls are represented, enclosing a great tower or keep in the centre. The entrances are great arched gateways flanked by square towers. These and the other towers have overhanging parapets just like the mediaeval machicolations, and are finished at top with battlements, remains of which have been found at [[Kalhu|Nimrud]] and [[Kouyunjik]], and at [[Assur]], the capital of Assyria before Nineveh.

Of temples distinct from the palace we have a few supposed remains, but little is absolutely known as to their general form.

But in Chaldea there are some enormous masses of ruins, evidently remains of the vast mounds which formed the substructure of their temples. The grandest of all these and the most interesting is the temple of [[Nabu|Nabû]] at [[Borsippa]] (now Birs Nimrod), near [[Babylon]], which has been identified as the temple of the Seven Spheres. This was reconstructed by Nebuchadnezzar, as appears by a well-known inscription. Another example is at [[Ur|Mugheir]], which was {{convert|198|ft|m}} by {{convert|133|ft|m}} at the base, and is even now {{convert|70|ft|m}} high, and it is clear that both it and the Birs were built with diminishing stages, presenting a series of grand platforms, decreasing in length as they ascended, and leaving a comparatively small one at top for the temple cell. This has been found, it is supposed, at the Birs Nimroud, of vitrified brick made in ancient ovens.

==Landscape architecture==
Text sources indicate open space planning was a part of the city from the earliest times. The description of [[Uruk]] in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' tells of one third of that city set aside for orchards. Similar planned open space is found at the one fifth enclosure of [[Nippur]]. Another important landscape element was the vacant lot (Akkadian: ''kišubbû'').

External to the city, Sumerian irrigation agriculture created some of the first garden forms in history. The garden (sar) was 144 square cubits with a perimeter canal.&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia, [[Sumer]]&lt;/ref&gt; This form of the enclosed quadrangle was the basis for the later paradise gardens of [[Persia]].

In Mesopotamia, the use of [[fountain]]s date as far back as the 3rd millennium BC. An early example is preserved in a carved [[Babylonia]]n basin, dating back to ''circa'' 3000 B.C., found at [[Girsu]], [[Lagash]]. An ancient Assyrian fountain "discovered in the gorge of the Comel River consists of basins cut in solid rock and descending in steps to the stream." The water was led from small [[Channel (geography)|conduit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=fountain|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/214794/fountain|accessdate=2010-03-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100502072841/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/214794/fountain| archivedate= 2 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
The son of an [[East Germany|East German]] diplomat, Barth spent a large part of his early life in [[Hungary]], studying between 1977 and 1983 at the [[Eötvös Loránd University]] in [[Budapest]].   His subject here was [[Hungarian studies]] (especially [[philology]] and history).   He then worked in various academic institutions in [[East Germany]] until 1988 when he found himself banned from professional work.

After the [[Die Wende|reunification of Germany]], during the 1990s, he worked as an academic research assistant at the [[Free University of Berlin]].   Between May 2002 and September 2003 he was an academic research assistant focusing on the "Theory and history of power" (''"Theorie und Geschichte der Gewalt"'') at the [[:de:Hamburger Institut für Sozialforschung|Hamburg Institute for Social Research]].   Since then he has worked as a freelance historian, translator and academic journalist.

==Output==
Bernd-Rainer Barth has become known, in particular, as a producer and co-author for the biographical collection [[:de:Wer war wer in der DDR?|"Wer war wer in der DDR?" ("Who was who in the German Democratic Republic")]],&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbanken/&gt; a standard reference resource.  Barth has himself contributed to more than 600 of the entries in it.

He has also become known for a two volume study on [[Noel Field]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernd-Rainer Barth, [[:de:Werner Schweizer (Regisseur)|Werner Schweizer (Ed)]], [[:de:Thomas Grimm|Thomas Grimm]]: ''Der Fall Noel Field''. Basisdruck, Berlin 2006 {{ISBN|3861631377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Black Legend of the Spanish Inquisition''' is the hypothesis of the existence of a series of myths and fabrications about the [[Spanish Inquisition]] used as propaganda against the [[Spanish Empire]] in a time of strong military, commercial and political rivalry between European powers, starting in the 16th century. The propaganda depicts the inquisition as the [[epitome]] of human barbarity with fantastic scenes of tortures, witch hunting and evil friars. As such, it is a part of the [[Black Legend|Spanish Black Legend]] propaganda, as well as of [[Anti-Catholicism|Anti-Catholic propaganda]], and one of its most recurrent themes.

Historian Edward Peters defines it as: {{quote|a body of myths and legends that between the sixteenth and twentieth centuries, established the perceived character of inquisitorial tribunals that have influenced all subsequent attempts to recover the historical reality.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Edward (1989). ''Inquisition''. University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-06630-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Henry Kamen:  {{quote|At all times, imperial nations tend to suffer ... in the arena of public opinion, and Spain was no exception, becoming the first victim of a long tradition of polemic that picked on the Inquisition as the most salient point of attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kamen | first = Henry |authorlink=Henry Kamen | title = The Spanish Inquisition : A Historical Revision | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-0-300-18051-0 | page = 379}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

==Black legend==
The black legend mechanism operates by taking a fact (the Spanish Inquisition existed, it was a phenomenon of [[religious intolerance]], and it practiced torture), twisting it, mixing it with fabrications and blowing it out of proportion (the impossible and baseless numbers reported, that would account to 1/3 of the population and impact the economy in ways that were not observed, the fantastic descriptions of torture machines and stories of sadism and mutilation of millions of people, often fabricated in propaganda workshops&lt;ref&gt;art by Theodor de Bry&lt;/ref&gt;); ignoring or twisting the context (both religious intolerance and torture were common practices all across Europe, and among the manifestations of it the Spanish inquisition proved itself among the most mellow ones,&lt;ref&gt;Haliczer, Stephen, Inquisition and society in the kingdom of Valencia, 1478-1834, p. 79, University of California Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Edward, Inquisition, Dissent, Heterodoxy and the Medieval Inquisitional Office, pp. 92-93, University of California Press (1989), {{ISBN|0-520-06630-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;); ignoring any positive traits- it was the first judicial body in Europe that operated according to a system and not to judicial discretion, torture was restricted to 15 minutes per session and only allowed on adults under very specific conditions for a set number of times,&lt;ref name="Bethencourt, Francisco 1997"&gt;Bethencourt, Francisco. La Inquisition En La Época Moderna: España, Portugal E Italia, Silos Xv-xix. Madrid: Akal, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; inquisitors couldn´t draw blood, mutilate or cause any permanent harm in victims&lt;ref&gt;Kamen, Henry (1998). The Spanish Inquisition: a Historical Revision. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-300-07522-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; so water boarding was the most common method as opposed to the fantastic devices portrayed in propaganda,&lt;ref&gt;Scott, George Riley, The History of Torture Throughout the Ages, p. 172, Columbia University Press (2003) {{ISBN|0-7103-0837-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a doctor had to be present, (most inquisitors didn´t believe in witchcraft &lt;ref name="Bethencourt, Francisco 1997"/&gt; etc...); and finally systematically neglecting to mention similar actions by other institutions or nations. This construction, the black legend, turns a relatively regular or unremarcable- for the context- event into an exceptionality in scope and nature, attached to one nation alone. As such, the black legend of the inquisition is created to demonize the other- Spain and/or Catholicism- and maintained as self-justification for those whose´s own deeds are overshadowed or ignored.

==Origin==
[[Image:Torture Inquisition.jpg|thumb|300px|Typical 18th-century European image of the [[Inquisition]].]]
Kamen&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Kamen|Kamen, Henry]] (1999). ''The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision.'' Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-07880-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; establishes two sources for the Black Legend of the Spanish Inquisition. Firstly, an [[Catholicism in Italy|Italian Catholic]] origin, and secondly, a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] background in [[Central Europe|Central]] and Northern Europe. Most historians place most of the weight on the Protestant and Calvinist origin though, since in the Italian propaganda Spaniards were most often portrayed as [[atheists]] or Jews than as fanatics.&lt;ref&gt;Elvira, Roca Barea María, and Arcadi Espada. Imperiofobia Y Leyenda Negra: Roma, Rusia, Estados Unidos Y El Imperio Español. Madrid: Siruela, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
The increasing influence during the sixteenth century of the [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]] Crown and later of the Spanish one on the [[Italian Peninsula]] led [[public opinion]], including the [[Pope|Papacy]], to see the Spaniards as a threat. An unfavorable image of Spain grew that naturally ended up involving a negative view of the Inquisition. [[Revolt]]s against the Inquisition in Spanish Crown territories in [[Sicily]] occurred in 1511 and 1526 and mere rumors of the future establishment of tribunals caused riots in [[Naples]] in 1547 and 1564.

The ambassadors of the independent Italian governments promoted the image of an impoverished Spain dominated by a [[Tyranny|tyrannical]] Inquisition. In 1525, Contarini, [[Venice|Venetian]] ambassador, said that all tremble before the Inquisition. Another ambassador, Tiepolo, wrote in 1563 that everyone is afraid of its authority, which has absolute [[Political power|power]] over [[property]], life, [[honor]] and even the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s of men. He also, commented that the [[Monarchy of Spain|King]] favors it as a way to control the population. Ambassador Soranzo stated in 1565 that the Inquisition had greater [[authority]] than the King. [[Francesco Guicciardini]], [[Florence|Florentine]] ambassador at the court of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]], stated that Spaniards were "in appearance religious, but not in reality", almost the same words by Tiepolo in 1536.

In general, Italians considered the Inquisition as a necessary evil for the Spaniards, whose religion was questionable if not false, after centuries of mixing with Jews and [[morisco]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Arnoldsson (1960), p.20-22, 95; Peters (1989), p.132; García Cárcel (1997), p.27-29; Kamen (1999), p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, after 1492, the word [[marrano]] became synonymous with Spaniard and [[Pope Alexander VI]] was called the "circumcised marrano". 
However, it was seen as an insulting insinuation to place an inquisition in Naples since they "didn´t need an Inquistion". They were proper Christians, not half atheists half Jews in clear need of correction due to natural moral weakness and impure blood. The argument against the inquisition was often one of indignation and not of fear. When the Inquisition began to persecute [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], the explanation was that the Spaniards were by nature more prone to [[heresy]] than Italians, so it was still seen as not necessary in Italy.
Another force in this rejection was the force of the  [[Papal States]]. The Papal Inquisition had been operating in Naples as a way of controlling the territory since the Middle Ages. One of the reasons why Spain wanted to introduce the Spanish Inquisition instead was precisely to counter or reduce that foreign influence in Spanish territory, and as such the Pope and powers rival to Spain invited, or even brived, disobedience to try and preserve their power in Naples&lt;ref&gt;The Papacy and the Levant, 1204-1571. Setton, Kenneth Meyer. American Philosophical Society, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian sources can hardly be considered as "part of the legend" since their deformation of the facts is not systematic and sustained through time but a reasonable reaction to having a foreign institution imposed upon them, but have been used out of context once said legend was already established.

=== Habsburg Spain ===

The Spanish Inquisition was one of the administrative and juridic arms of the Spanish Crown. It was created, among other things, to keep both powerful noble families and the Roman Catholic Church in check. This sectors of society had the power to dispute, or dodge, the authority of the king at a local level, and were also the demographics with higher literacy rates, wealth, and international relationships.  
The main role of the Inquisition was to prevent internal division in the empire and, even though the religious aspect of it is overly emphasized in the popular image, the fragmentation of power and local coalitions to dispute Royal power were an important part of this cohesion as well. It investigated nobles who wished to put their own local interests over the interests of the crown, and the Pope's desires to intervene and gain control over the Empire, usually with the aid of foreign powers (here is where the religious aspect comes and mixes since said powers usually were Protestant). As an independent body from the Pope, the Spanish Inquisition also had the ability to judge clergy for both corruption and treason without the interference of the Pope, which allowed the king to hold clergy accountable in his realm and limit Papal influence in it. As a consequence, the Inquisition systematically ruffled the feathers of the most powerful people inside the Spanish Empire as well as in the Vatican.

The Spanish Inquisition's trial records show a disproportionate over-representation of nobility and clergy among those who are being investigated and prosecuted. The vast majority of the investigations that the Inquisition initiated itself (investigations on middle and low-class people were usually the consequence of the denounce of neighbors and rarely self-started by the institution). Among the trials, those who are conducted over nobility and clergy were also far more likely to be found guilty and convicted. While for the lay Spaniard who had no education to put their thoughts on paper nor the power to spread them, the Inquisition was far more compassionate and lenient than the civil alternative (the civil tribunals and the King's prisons, with no food and unrestricted use of torture), for the powerful the Inquisition was far worse than what they were used to in civil courts (no accountability at all). The sectors the Spanish Inquisition was designed to address and control were also the same sectors that had the education and resources to write and spread said writing, as well as the ones with something to win from any propaganda campaign. Either by accident, just as the result of mostly discontent people were the only ones who could write and talk about the institution internationally, or by design, the negative accounts from Spain's very international nobility constituted a large number of the total accounts of the Inquisition produced.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Elvira, Roca Barea María, and Arcadi Espada. Imperiofobia Y Leyenda Negra: Roma, Rusia, Estados Unidos Y El Imperio Español. Madrid: Siruela, 201&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestantism===
In Northern Europe, the religious confrontation and the threat of [[Spanish Empire|Spanish imperial]] power gave birth to the Black Legend, as the small number of Protestants who were executed by the Inquisition would not have justified such a campaign. Protestants, who had successfully used the [[News media|press]] to disseminate their ideas, tried to win with propaganda the war they could not win by force of arms.&lt;ref name=Madden&gt;Madden, Thomas F. (2004). [http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/madden200406181026.asp "The Real Inquisition: Investigating the popular myth."], ''National Review''&lt;/ref&gt;

On one hand, Catholic [[Theology|theologians]] criticized the [[Protestantism|Protestants]] as newcomers, who, unlike the Catholic Church could not prove a continuity from the time of Christ. On the other hand, Protestants theologians reasoned that this was not true and that theirs was the true Church which had been oppressed and persecuted by the Catholic Church throughout history.&lt;ref name=Madden/&gt; This reasoning, which was only outlined by [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and [[John Calvin|Calvin]], was fleshed out by later Protestant historiography identified with [[John Wycliffe|Wycliffe]] or the [[Lollardy|lollard]]s of England, the [[Hussite]]s of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] and the [[Waldensians]] of France. All this despite the fact that in the 16th century heretics were persecuted in both Catholic and Protestant countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lutheran]]s and Catholics were violently persecuted and tortured in the England of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] by civil courts. In Europe, [[Martin Luther|Luther]], [[John Calvin|Calvin]], [[Melanchthon]], [[Zwingli]] and other reformers persecuted the [[anabaptist]]s, catholics and jews. For more information see also [http://ic.net/~erasmus/RAZ247.HTM#VI.%20DEATH%20AND%20TORTURE%20FOR%20CATHOLICS%20AND%20PROTESTANT The Protestant Inquisition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516070550/http://ic.net/~erasmus/RAZ247.HTM#VI.%20DEATH%20AND%20TORTURE%20FOR%20CATHOLICS%20AND%20PROTESTANT |date=16 May 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 16th century the Protestant denominations had identified with the heretics of previous times and defined them as [[martyr]]s.

When the persecution of Protestants started in Spain the hostility felt towards the Pope was immediately extended to include the King of Spain, on whom the Inquisition depended, and the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s who carried it out. After all, the greatest defeat suffered by the Protestants had been at the hands of [[Charles I of Spain]] in the [[battle of Mühlberg]] in 1547. An image of Spain as the champion of Catholicism spread throughout Europe. This image was in part promoted by the Spanish crown.
[[Image:John Foxe from NPG cleaned.jpg|thumb|200px|right|John Foxe (1516–1587) in an engraving by an unknown artist.]]

This identification by the Protestants with heretics from the time of the conversion of [[Imperial Rome]] until the 15th century lad to the creation of [[Martyrology|martyrologies]] in Germany and England, description of the lives of martyrs in morbid detail, usually heavily illustrated, that circulated among the poorer classes and which incited indignation against the Catholic Church. One of the most famous and influential was the ''[[Book of Martyrs]]'' by [[John Foxe]] (1516–1587). Foxe dedicated an entire chapter to the Spanish Inquisition: ''The execrable Inquisition of Spayne''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/johnfoxe/main/7_1570_1062.jsp ''The execrable Inquisition of Spayne''] on [http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/johnfoxe/index.html John Foxe's Book of Martyrs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709092855/http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/johnfoxe/index.html |date=9 July 2011 }} Extract:
{{quote|The cruell and barbarous Inquisition of Spayne... now it is practised agaynst them that be neuer so litle suspected to fauour the veritie of þe Lorde. The Spanyardes, and especially the great diuines there do hold, that this holy and sacrate Inquisition can not erre, and that the holy fathers the Inquisitours, can not be deceaued... Three sortes of men most principally be in daūger of these Inquisitours. They that bee greatly riche, for the spoyle of their goods. They that be learned, because they will not haue their misdealynges and secret abuses to be espyed and detected. They that begyn to encrease in honor and dignitie, leste they beyng in authoritie, should worke them some shame, or dishonor... yea and thoughe no worde bee spoken, yet if they beare any grudge or euill will agaynst the partie, incontinent they commaunde him to be taken, and put in an horrible prison, and then finde out crimes agaynst him at leasure, and in the meane tyme no man liuyng so hardye once to open his mouth for him. If the father speake one worde for his childe, he is also taken, and cast into prison, as a fauourer of heretickes. Neither is it permitted to any person, to enter to the prisoner: but there he is alone, in such a place, where he can not see so much as the groūde, where hee is, and is not suffred eithre to read or write, but there endureth in darkenes palpable, in horrors infinite, in feare miserable, wrastlyng with the assaultes of death... Adde more ouer to these distresses &amp; horrors of the prison, the iniuries, threats, whippings &amp; scourgings, yrons, tortures, &amp; rackes, which they endure. Some tymes also they are brought out, and shewed forth in some higher place, to the people, as a spectacle, of rebuke and infamie... The accuser secret, the crime secret, the witnes secret: what soeuer is done, is secret, neither is the poore prisoner euer aduertised of any thyng.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the themes that are repeated later on are to be found in this text: anyone can be tried for any triviality; the Inquisition is infallible; people are usually accused to gain money, because of jealousy or to hide the actions of the Inquisition; if proof is not found it is invented; the prisoners are isolated with no contact with the outside world in dark dungeons where they suffer horrible torture etc. Foxe warned that this sinister organization could be introduced into any country that accepted the Catholic faith.

Another influential book was the ''Sanctae Inquisitionis Hispanicae Artes'' (''Exposition of the Arts of the Spanish Holy Inquisition'') published in [[Heidelberg]] in 1567 under the pseudonym [[Reginaldus Gonsalvius Montanus]]. It appears that Gonzalvius was a pseudonym of [[Antonio del Corro]], a Spanish Protestant theologian exiled in [[Holland]]. Del Corro added credibility to his tale with his knowledge of the tribunal. The book was an immediate success, two editions were printed between 1568 and 1570 in English and French, three in Dutch, four in German and one in Hungarian, and the book continued to be published and referenced until the 19th century.

The largely fabricated story relates the tale of a prisoner who passes through all the stages of the process and above all the interrogation, allowing the reader to identify with the victim. Del Corro's description presents some of the most extreme practices as being routine, such as the innocence of all the accused, the officials of the Inquisition are shown as being devious and vain and each step of the process is shown as a violation of [[natural law]]. Del Corro supported the initial purpose of the Inquisition which was to persecute false converts and he had not foreseen that his book would be used to support the Black Legend in a similar manner to that of [[Bartolomé de las Casas]]. He was convinced that the Dominican monks had converted the Inquisition into something execrable, that [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] was not aware of the true proceedings and that the Spanish people were opposed to the sinister organization.

=== Bourbon Spain ===

Spanish Bourbons brought French absolutism and centralization to a largely decentralized and relatively liberal nation. The reaction was one of resentment and further polarization of Spanish society as the high nobility and the church, happy with the new acquisition of power, sided and supported the French monarchy ("[[afrancesados]]") while other sectors got polarised in growing antimonarchic and anti-French hostility. This situation contributed to the feeding of the black legend of the Inquisition from both extrema. On one side, the court of Spain was suddenly dominated by French intellectuals that came along with the first Bourbon king. As a result, the predominant historiographic view was the French view, which portrayed Spain and the Inquisition as violent and barbaric as consequence of centuries of rivalry between both powers. Those Spanish intellectuals who wished to advance and earn recognition in the court had to adopt said views in order to earn respect. On the other extreme, the protection for the absolutist Bourbons of the church generated a growing identification of the church, the old regime, monarchic absolutism and the king. Eventually, antimonarchic intellectuals and Spaniards resenting the new rule started identifying with the alleged cruelties of the medieval church and the Inquisition as reflections of their own perceived oppression under the Bourbons. The Black Legend of the Inquisition, already created and packed for consumption through the XVI and XVII century by England, the Netherlands, and Germany, and introduced in Spain through France was adopted by both sides as throwing accusation. Since the legend used the alleged cruelty of the Inquisition to diminish both Spain and Catholicism, each side picked half of it and used it to either defend the "illustrated" French rule or to attack absolutism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
This strife provided with a new body of completely misinformed and undocumented texts on the Inquisition written by Spaniards as propaganda against certain aspects of the government. During the 18th century, the existence of said Inquisition itself seemed to calm the waters and most criticisms was focussed towards the past. During the severe unrest of the 19th century, it was turned by the king not against foreign powers but against Spanish liberals.&lt;ref&gt;‘Goya’s Inquisition: from Black Legend to Liberal Legend’, Vida Hispánica, no. 46, September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of these Spanish Liberal contributions to the black legend would be [[Goya]]'s engravings, [[José del Olmo]]’s narrative accounts, Francisco Rizi(Italian but Spanish sympathiser) engravings.&lt;ref&gt;Representational strategies of inclusion and exclusion in José del Olmo’s narrative and Francisco Rizi’s visual record of the Madrid Auto de Fe of 1680’, Romance Studies, vol. 29, no. 4, November 2011, pp.223-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

== European politics in the 16th century ==
A number of books appeared between 1559 and 1562 that presented the Inquisition as a threat to the liberties enjoyed by Europeans. These writings reasoned that those countries that accepted the Catholic religion not only lost their religious liberties but also their civil liberties due to the Inquisition. To illustrate their point they would describe [[autos-da-fé]] and tortures and they would provide numerous stories from people that had fled from the Inquisition. The [[Reformation]] was seen as a liberation of the human soul from darkness and superstition.

France, Britain and Holland had the most active presses on the continent and they were used very effectively as a means of defense when these countries felt threatened. The documents generated between 1548 and 1581 became reference materials in the studies of later historians.

=== Holland ===
There was a generally held fear in Holland dating from the reign of [[Charles I of Spain|Charles I]] that the king would try to introduce the Inquisition in order to reduce civil liberties, even though Phillip II had stated that the Spanish Inquisition was not exportable. Phillip II recognized that Holland had its own inquisition more ruthless than the one in Spain. Between 1557 and 1562 the courts in [[Antwerp]] executed 103 heretics, more than were killed in the whole of Spain in this same period. Various changes in the organization of the Dutch Inquisition increased people's fears of both the Spanish Inquisition and the local one. In addition, opposition grew to such an extent through the 16th century that it was feared anarchy would break out if Calvinism was not legalized.
[[Image:WilliamOfOrange1555.jpg|thumb|200px|right|William Of Orange (1533–1584) painted by C. Garschagen.]]
This fear was manipulated by Protestants and by those calling for Dutch independence in pamphlets such as ''On the Unchristian, tyrannical Inquisition that Persecutes Belief, Written from the Netherlands'' or ''The Form of the Spanish Inquisition Introduced in Lower Germany in the Year 1550'' published by Michael Lotter. In 1570, religious refugees presented a document to the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] entitled ''A Defence and true declaration of the things lately done in the lowe countrey'' which described not only the crimes perpetrated against Protestants but also accused the Spanish Inquisition of inciting revolts in Holland in order to force Phillip II to exercise a firm hand, and accused him of the death of [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias|Prince Carlos of Asturias]].

=== Great Britain ===
The English fear to a Spanish invasion since the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)|Anglo-Spanish War]], and the need of [[Elizabeth I of England]]to legitimate herself on the throne after 20 years of conspiracies against her stimulated anti-Spanish propaganda.

The Catholic monarchs in England, had created religious courts to fight against heresy, the last being created by [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]]. The English monarchs, above all Elizabeth I, preferred to create civil tribunals to repress religious dissidents, above all Catholics, distancing themselves from the previous practices. Catholic heretics were identified as traitors by a system that was not that much different from the Inquisition. It even went so far as to kidnap an English Catholic lawyer from the Netherlands, [[John Story (martyr)|John Story]], before taking him to England to be tortured, accused of treason and conspiracy and executed. The system by which the government insisted on trying traitors, not heretics, remained in place until the reign of [[James I of England|James I]] which maintained the illusion that the Inquisition was a catholic institution clearly identified with Spain and Rome.

In this way the religious fanatics gained the support of others who were more moderate and above all of the government, which financed pamphlets and published edicts. During this time many pamphlets were published and translated including ''A Fig for the Spaniard''.&lt;ref&gt;A list of some of these pamphlets and the text of ''A Fig for the Spaniard'' can be found at [https://web.archive.org/web/20071118191825/http://www.spanport.ucsb.edu/projects/ehumanista/projects/spanish_black_legend/01.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; A leaflet published by [[Antonio Pérez (statesman)|Antonio Pérez]] in 1598 entitled ''A treatise Paraenetical'' repeated William of Orange's claims conferring a tragic aspect to Prince Carlos of Asturias and one of religious fanaticism to Phillip II and the Inquisition that survived into modern era.

== The 17th century ==
During the 16th century some Catholic and Protestant thinkers had already begun to discuss the [[freedom of conscience]], but the movement was marginal up until the start of the 17th century. It considered that those states that carried out religious persecution were not only poor Christians,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacobus Acontius]] stated that "killing a man is not defending a doctrine, it is killing a man''&lt;/ref&gt; but also illogical,&lt;ref&gt;. The reasoning behind this is that no dogma is infallible, therefore it can not be used to persecute people&lt;/ref&gt; given that they acted on the basis of a conjecture and not a certainty. These thinkers attacked all types of religious persecution, but the Inquisition offered them a perfect target for their criticism. These points of view were most popular with the followers of minority religious beliefs, "dissidents", such as [[Remonstrants]], [[Anabaptist]]s, [[Quaker]]s, [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], [[Mennonite]]s etc. In fact, [[Philipp van Limborch]], the great historian of the Inquisition, was a Remonstrant and Gilbert Brunet, an English historian of the [[Reformation]] was a [[Latitudinarian]].

Towards the end of the 16th century the [[religious wars in Europe]] had made it clear that any attempt to make religiously uniform states were bound to fail. Intellectuals, starting in Holland and France, affirmed that the State should occupy itself with the well-being of its citizens even if this allowed the growth of the heresy of allowing tolerance in exchange for social peace. By the end of the 17th century these ideas had spread to Central Europe and diversity was beginning to be considered more "natural" than uniformity, and that, in fact, uniformity threatened the richness of a nation. Spain was the perfect demonstration of this. It had started to decline economically by the middle of the 17th century and the expulsion of the Jews and other rich, industrious citizens was thought to be one of the main reasons for this decline. Also, the fines and seizures of property and wealth would make the problem worse, as the money was being directed to unproductive areas of the Catholic Church.

The Inquisition was therefore converted into an enemy of the state and as such was reflected as such in the economic and political tracts of the time. In 1673, [[Francis Willughby|Francis Willoughby]] wrote ''A Relation of a Voyage Made through a Great Part of Spain'' in which he concluded the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peters |first=Edward |date=1989 |title=Inquisition |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TnqLow3iKd4C&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=A+Relation+of+a+Voyage+Made+through+a+Great+Part+of+Spain#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20Relation%20of%20a%20Voyage%20Made%20through%20a%20Great%20Part%20of%20Spain&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=University of California Press |page=163 |isbn=0-520-06630-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The liberal European societies started to look down on those societies that maintained their uniformity, they were also the object of social analysis. The existence of the Inquisition in Portugal, Spain and Rome was thought to be due to the use of force or because the spirit of the people was weakened, it was not considered possible that the Inquisition was supported voluntarily. This supposed weakness of spirit combined with the strength of the Inquisition in these countries was predicted to lead to a lack of imagination and learning as well as hindering advances in science, literature and the arts. Spain, despite the golden age of the [[Siglo de Oro]] and although the Inquisition generally only focused on doctrinal matters, is represented after the 17th century as a country without [[Spanish literature|literature]], [[Spanish art|art]] or science.

As of the 17th century the "Spanish character" was included as part of the analysis of the Inquisition. This supposed "Spanish character" was publicized in many travel books which were the most popular type of literature of the period. One of the first and the most influential was written by the [[Countess d'Aulnoy]] in 1691 in which she consistently belittled Spanish achievements in the arts and sciences. Other notable books from the 18th century include those by Juan Álvarez de Colmenar, (1701), Jean de Vayarac (1718), Pierre-Louis-Auguste de Crusy, Marquis de Marcillac,&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Louis-Auguste de Crusy, Marquis de Marcillac, ''Nouveau Voyage en Espagne fait en 1777 &amp; 1778, dans lequel on traite des Moeurs, des Monumens anciens &amp; modernes, du Commerce, du Théâtre, de la Législation, des Tribunaux particuliers à ce Royaume &amp; de l'Inquisition; avec de nouveaux détails sur son état actuel, &amp; sur une procédure récente &amp; fameuse'', Londres 1782, P. Elmsly, 2 vol. in-8°. After classifying the Spanish as lazy, vengeful and proud he writes "aside from a crass ignorance, which is due to the education they receive and whose origins is in that court which meets in order to shame philosophy and the human spirit, I have not seen more than virtues in the Spanish.''&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Clarke,&lt;ref&gt;Anglican priest, in 1763 he published ''Letters concerning the Spanish Nation: Written at Madrid during the years 1760 and 1761''. Clarke excused the Spanish people's backwardness, blaming it on the Inquisition.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Swinburne]],&lt;ref&gt;(1743–1803); ''Travels through Spain in the Years 1775 and 1776''. Swinburne, for example, stated that [[Pablo de Olavide]], Mayor of [[Sevilla]], who was tried by the Inquisition in 1776 "was held prisoner in the dungeons of the Inquisition, where he will probably end his days." Olavide in fact fled to France where the philosophers received him as a hero. He was a victim of the [[Reign of Terror]] and so returned to Spain where his possessions were restored to him and he died peacefully in 1803.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tobias George Smollett]],&lt;ref&gt;(1721- 1771), in his book ''The present State of All Nations containing a geographical natural, commercial and political History of all the Countries in the Known World.'' London (1769), vol. V. pp. 205 onwards&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Twiss (writer)|Richard Twiss]] and innumerable others who perpetuated the Black Legend.&lt;ref&gt;For example, an anonymous book published in London in 1770 states that "...the mind of the inhabitants is darkened by superstition and the efforts of erudition are beset by the terrors of the Inquisition and many other shackles, by which the tyranny of the clergy maintains the people in slavery."&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that influential [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writers such as [[Pierre Bayle]] (1647–1706) obtained much of their knowledge of Spain from these stories.

== The Enlightenment ==
[[Montesquieu]] saw in Spain the perfect example of the maladministration of a state under the influence of the clergy. Once again the Inquisition was deemed to be guilty of the economic ruin of nations, the great enemy of political freedom and social productivity, and not just in Spain and Portugal, there were signs throughout Europe that other countries could come to be "infected" with this contagion. He described an Inquisitor as someone "separated from society, in a wretched condition, starved of any kind of relationship, so that he will be tough, ruthless and inexorable...". In his book "The Spirit of the Laws" he dedicates chapter XXV.13 to the Inquisition. The chapter is written in such a way as to call attention to a young Jew who was burnt to death by the Inquisition in [[Lisbon]]. Montesquieu is therefore one of the first to describe the Jews as victims.
[[Image:Voltaire.jpg|200px|thumb|Voltaire (1694–1778) painted by [[Nicolas de Largillière]].]]

No 18th-century author did more to disparage religious persecution than [[Voltaire]]. Voltaire did not have a deep knowledge of the Inquisition until later in life, but he often used it to sharpen his satire and ridicule his opponents, as shown by his Don Jerónimo Bueno Caracúcarador, an Inquisitor who appears in ''Histoire de Jenni'' (1775). In ''Candide'' (1759), one of his best known titles, he does not show a knowledge of the functioning of the Inquisition greater than that to be found in travel books and general histories. ''Candide'' includes his famous description of an ''[[auto-da-fé]]'' in Lisbon, a satirical gem, that introduces the Inquisition to comedy. Voltaire's attacks on the Inquisition became more serious and acute from 1761. He shows a better understanding and knowledge of the internal workings of the tribunal, probably thanks to the work of [[Abbe Morellet]] who he used extensively and to his direct knowledge of some cases, such as that of [[Gabriel Malagrida]], whose death in Lisbon caused a wave of indignation throughout Europe.

Abbe Morellet published his ''Petite écrit sur une matière intéresante'' and ''Manuel des Inquisiteurs'' in 1762.&lt;ref&gt;A summary / translation of the ''[[Directorium Inquisitorum]]'' by Nicolás Aymerich and also adding data from the work by Luís de Páramo. Roderich Usher, a character in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "The fall of the House of Usher" often read it.&lt;/ref&gt; Both works extracted and summarized the darkest parts of the Inquisition and focussed on the use of deception to secure convictions, thereby making procedures known that even the most bitter enemies of the Inquisition had ignored.

Abbe [[Guillaume-Thomas Raynal]] attained a fame equivalent to that of Montesquieu, Voltaire or [[Rousseau]] with his book ''Histoire philosophique et politique des établissements et du commerce des européens dans les deux Indes'', even to the point that in 1789 he was considered one of the fathers of the [[French Revolution]]. His ''History of the Indies'' gained fame thanks to its censorship and a number of editions were published in [[Amsterdam]], Geneva, [[Nantes]] and [[The Hague]] between 1770 and 1774. As one would expect, the book was also about the Inquisition. In this case Raynal did not criticize the deaths or the use of torture, instead he stated that thanks to the Inquisition Spain had not suffered religious wars. He thought that in order to return Spain to the [[Concert of Europe]] the Inquisition would need to be eliminated which would require the importation of foreigners of all beliefs as the only means of attaining "good results" in a reasonable amount of time; as he considered that the use of indigenous workers would take centuries to achieve the same results.

One of the most important works of the century, ''[[L'Encyclopédie]]'', dedicated one of its entries to the Inquisition. The article was written by [[Louis de Jaucourt]] a man of science who had studied at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] and who also wrote the majority of the articles about Spain. Jaucourt was not very fond of Spain and many of his articles were filled with invective. He wrote articles on Spain, [[Iberia]], Holland, [[wool]], [[monastery|monasteries]] and titles of the nobility etc. which were all derogatory. Although his article on wine praised Spanish wine his conclusion was that its abuse can cause incurable illnesses.

The article on the Inquisition is clearly taken from Voltaire's writings. For example, the description of the ''auto-da-fé'' is based on that given by Voltaire in ''Candide''. The text is a ferocious attack against Spain:&lt;ref&gt;English translators version of the authors translation into Spanish from the original French:
{{Quote|Il faut que le génie des Espagnols eût alors quelque chose de plus impitoyable que celui des autres nations. On le voit par les cruautés réfléchies qu'ils commirent dans le nouveau monde: on le voit surtout par l'excès d'atrocité qu'ils portèrent dans l'exercice d'une juridiction où les Italiens ses inventeurs mettaient beaucoup de douceur. Les papes avaient érigé ces tribunaux par politique, et les inquisiteurs espagnols y ajoutèrent la barbarie la plus atroce}} L'Encyclopédie Vol VIII, page 774 b&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|It is the genius of the Spanish to have something more ruthless than other nations...which is seen above all in the excess of atrocities they use in the exercise of an institution into which the Italians, its inventors, put a lot of sweetness. The Popes had built these courts with politics and the Spanish Inquisitors added the most atrocious barbarity.|Louis de Jaucourt, ''L'Encyclopédie''}} Repeating what Voltaire had already said: «The Inquisition would be the cause of the ignorance of philosophy that Spain lives in, thanks to which Europe and "even Italy" had discovered so many truths.»

After the publication of L'Encyclopédie came an even more ambitious project, that of the "Encyclopédie méthodique" which comprised 206 volumes. The article on Spain was written by Masson de Morvilliers&lt;ref&gt;Author of the famous question "What do we owe to Spain?  And during the last two centuries, the last four, the last ten, what has Spain done for Europe? The implied response being "nothing".&lt;/ref&gt; and it naturally mentions the Inquisition. He advances the theory that the Spanish monarchy is nothing more than the play thing of the church and specifically the Inquisition. That is to say, the Inquisition is the true government of Spain. He explains that the cruelty of the Spanish Inquisition is due, in part, to the rivalry between the [[Franciscan]]s and the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s. In [[Venice]] and [[Tuscany]] the Inquisition was in the hands of the Franciscans and in Spain it was in the hands of the Dominicans. Who "in order to distinguish itself in this odious task, were led to unprecedented excesses". He recounts the legend of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] who on seeing the death of two convicts commented "Here are two unfortunate men who are dying for something they believe in!"&lt;ref&gt;Translated from the French: ''Voilà duex hommes bien malheureux de mourir pour une chose dont ils sont persuadés!''&lt;/ref&gt; When the Inquisition was informed it demanded a [[Bloodletting|phlebotomy]] of the King whose blood was then burnt.

== The 19th and 20th centuries ==
The Historian [[Ronald Hilton]]&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, Ronald, [http://wais.stanford.edu/Spain/spain_blacklegendin18thcentury32502.html SPAIN: The Black Legend in the 18th century] (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; has attributed much importance to this 18th-century image of Spain. It would have given [[Napoleon]] the ideological justification for his [[Peninsular War|invasion]] in 1807: the enlightened French taking their light to the backward and benighted Spain. In fact, one of the reforms that Napoleon introduced in Spain was the elimination of the Inquisition.

In addition, Reverend Ingram Cobbin MA, in a 19th-century reissue of Foxe's ''The Book of Martyrs'' regaled his readers with the most fantastic tales about what the French troops found in the Inquisition's prison when they occupied Madrid&lt;ref&gt;Back translation from Spanish of Kamen's book; ''The Book of Martyrs'', ed. 1863, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|...they found instruments of torture of every sort... the third [machine found] was infernal, hung horizontally, into which the victim was tied: the machine hung between two collections of knives, located in such a way that turning the machine with a crank the flesh of the victims limbs was completely torn into small pieces. The fourth [machine] surpassed all the others in evil genius. Its exterior was a large richly dressed mannequin with the appearance of a beautiful woman with its arms extended ready to embrace her victim. A semicircle was drawn on the ground around it and the person that crossed this deadly mark touched a spring that caused the opening of the demonic machine, its arms grasped the victim and thousands of knives tore him to pieces.}}

=== America ===
In the same way that England had used the Black Legend as a political weapon in the 16th century, America used it during the [[Cuban War of Independence]]. The American politician and orator [[Robert Green Ingersoll]] (1833–1899) is quoted as saying:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/robert_ingersoll/spain_and_spaniard.html Spain and the Spaniard].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Spain has always been exceedingly religious and exceedingly cruel... they were fearful that if they should grant the least concession to the Moor, God would destroy them. Their idea was that the only way to secure divine aid was to have absolute faith, and this faith was proved by their hatred of all ideas inconsistent with their own... Spain has been and is the victim of superstition... Nothing was left but Spaniards; that is to say, indolence, pride, cruelty and infinite superstition. So Spain destroyed all freedom of thought through the Inquisition, and for many years the sky was livid with the flames of the Auto de fe; Spain was busy carrying fagots to the feet of philosophy, busy in burning people for thinking, for investigating, for expressing honest opinions. The result was that a great darkness settled over Spain, pierced by no star and shone upon by no rising sun.}}

In America in the 19th century, knowledge of the Inquisition was spread by Protestant polemical writers and historians such as Prescott and [[John Lothrop]], whose ideology influenced the story. Along with the myths woven around the [[Salem witch trials|execution of witches in America]] the myth of the Inquisition was maintained as a malevolent abstraction, sustained by anti-Catholicism.

According to Peters, the terms ''inquisition'', ''inquisitorial'' and ''witch hunt'' became generalized in American society in the 1950s to refer to oppression by its government,&lt;ref&gt;In fact in ''Tree of Hate'' (page 28) Philip Wayne Powell states that the terms ''inquisition'' and ''witch hunt'' had become interchangeable even though the Inquisition hardly ever persecuted witchcraft.&lt;/ref&gt; whether referring to the past or the present, this was possibly due to the influence of contemporary European authors. [[Carey McWilliams (journalist)|Carey McWilliams]] published ''Witch Hunt: The Revival of Heresy'' in 1950 which was a study of the [[Committee of Un-American Activities]] in which wide use was made of the term ''Inquisition'' to refer to the contemporary phenomenon of anticommunist hysteria. The tenor of the work was later widened in ''The American Inquisition, 1945–1960'' by [[Cedric Belfrage]] and even later in 1982 with the book ''Inquisition: Justice and Injustice in the Cold War'' by [[Stanley Kutler]]. The term ''inquisition'' has become so widely used that it has come to be a synonym for "official investigation, especially of a political or religious nature, characterized by its lack of respect for individual rights, prejudice on the part of the judges and cruel punishments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peters |first=Edward |date=1989 |title=Inquisition |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TnqLow3iKd4C&amp;pg=PA315&amp;lpg=PA315&amp;dq=Peters+Inquisition+official+investigation,+especially+of+a+political+or+religious+nature#v=onepage&amp;q=Peters%20Inquisition%20official%20investigation%2C%20especially%20of%20a%20political%20or%20religious%20nature&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=University of California Press |page=315 |isbn=0-520-06630-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Black Legend in Spain ==
The degree to which the Spanish people accepted the Inquisition is hard to evaluate.&lt;ref&gt;On one hand, none of the popular revolts of the 16th and 17th centuries attacked the Inquisition. The only problem occurred in 1640 when the Inquisitor was expelled from [[Barcelona]], however, this was not for being an Inquisitor but because he was Castilian. It was not until March 1820 that a mob attacked the palace of the tribunal in [[Madrid]], which was by that time virtually empty. On the other hand, it is clear that the [[converso]]s and the peoples of [[Aragon]], Catalonia and [[Navarre]] were to a greater or lesser extent opposed to the Inquisition. A few particular cases, such as the abuses of the Cordovan Inquisitor Diego Rodríguez Lucero or the trial against the Archbishop of Granada Hernando de Talavera caused the ire of the populace at large. The Castilian Parliaments (in 1518 in [[Valladolid]] and in 1520 in [[La Coruña]] etc) and that of [[Aragon]] tried on a number of occasions to limit the power of the Inquisition's Tribunal in order to remedy abuses but never with the intention of eliminating the institution.&lt;/ref&gt; Kamen tried to summarize the situation by saying that the Inquisition was considered as an evil necessary for maintaining order. It is not as if there were not any critics of the Tribunal, there were many as is evident from the Inquisition's own archives, but these critics are not considered relevant to the Black Legend. For example, in 1542 Alonso de Virués, humanist and Archbishop, criticized its intolerance and those that used chains and the axe to change the disposition of the soul; Juan de Mariana, despite supporting the Inquisition, criticized forced conversions and the belief in purity of blood ([[limpieza de sangre]]).

Public opinion slowly started to change after the 18th century thanks to contacts with the outside world, as a consequence the Black Legend began to appear in Spain. The religious and intellectual freedom in France was watched with interest and the initial victims of the Inquisition, conversos and moriscos, had disappeared. Enlightened intellectuals started to appear such as [[Pablo de Olavide]] and later [[Pedro Rodríguez, Conde de Campomanes|Pedro Rodríguez de Campomanes]] and [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]], who blamed the Inquisition for the injust treatment of the conversos. In 1811 [[Leandro Fernández de Moratín|Moratín]] published ''Auto de fe celebrado en la ciudad de Logroño'' &lt;ref&gt;A facsimile edition can be obtained from the Miguel de Cervantes Virtual Library: ''[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/FichaObra.html?Ref=7256 Auto de fe celebrado en la ciudad de Logroño en los días 7 y 8 de noviembre del año de 1610, siendo Inquisidor General el Cardenal, Arzobispo de Toledo, Bernardo de Sandobal y Roxas] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005125730/http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/FichaObra.html?Ref=7256 |date=5 October 2008 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; (Auto de fe held in the city of Logroño) which related the history of a large trial against a number of witches that took place in [[Logroño]], with satirical comments from the author. However, these liberal intellectuals, some of whom were members of the government, were not revolutionary and were preoccupied with the maintenance of the social order.

The Inquisition ceased to function in practice in 1808, during the [[Peninsular War|Spanish War of Independence]] as it was abolished by the occupying French government, although it remained as an institution until 1834.

A school of liberal historians appeared in France and Spain at the start of the 19th century who were the first to talk about Spanish decline. They considered the Inquisition to be responsible for this economic and cultural decline and for all the other evils that afflicted the country. Other European historians took up the theme later on and this position can still be seen today. This school of thought stated that the expulsion of the Jews and the persecution of the conversos had led to the impoverishment and decline of Spain as well as the destruction of the middle class.&lt;ref&gt;According to Kamen, none of these statements have never been proved; the Inquisition never interfered with commerce nor with industrial policy and although in the short term it is possible that it caused damage, even important damage, it could not have caused long term damage. (Kamen, pág. 313)&lt;/ref&gt; This type of author made [[Menéndez y Pelayo]] exclaim: {{quote|Why is there no industry in Spain? Because of the Inquisition. Why are the Spanish lazy? Because of the Inquisition. Why do the Spanish take a siesta? Because of the Inquisition. Why are there bull fights in Spain? Because of the Inquisition.|La ciencia española, Madrid, 1953, p. 102.}}

This school of thought along with the other elements of the Black Legend would form part of the Spanish anticlericalism of the end of the 19th century. This anticlericalism formed part of many other ideologies of the left wing, such as socialism, communism and [[anarchism]]. This is demonstrated by a statement made by the Socialist Member of Parliament Fernando Garrido in April 1869&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Garrido, Diario de Sesiones III, 1512 (30 April 1869), (cited by PETSCHEN, op. cit., Pp. 89); in [http://www.ucm.es/BUCM/revistas/inf/11370734/articulos/HICS9696110063A.PDF Una aproximación al anticlericalismo decimonónico] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117191507/http://www.ucm.es/BUCM/revistas/inf/11370734/articulos/HICS9696110063A.PDF |date=17 November 2010 }} by Mirta Núñez Díaz-Balart&lt;/ref&gt; that the Church had used the "Court of the Inquisition as an instrument for its own ends. The Church used the Inquisition to gag freedom of expression and impede the diffusion of the truth. It imposed a rigid despotism over three and a half centuries of Spanish history".

== Misunderstandings==

Some common mistakes when reporting inquisitorial activity done by XX century historians can´t be considered fully part of the black legend, even though they are likely prompted by assumptions created by the Black Legend in Historiography. They tend to steam from a lack of awareness of the modern-bourocratic nature of the Spanish Inquisition in a time in which most trials were still left to the judge´s personal discrection and will. This are the most common:

===Trial-Execution ratio===
====High Volume of Investigations====
Like a modern bureaucratic system, the Inquisitorial tribunal had the obligation to consider and investigate every single case that any cityzen of Spain brough to them, regardless of social level of the accuser or the previous opinion of the tribunal about the veracity of the claim. As a consequence the number of raw cases that the inquisition had to handle and the number of processes it opened was astronomical, even if the actual conviction rate of the Inquisitorial tribunal was really low, of 6% on average. The raw numbers of trials usually include cases of witchcraft or false accusations that were quickly identified as neighbour fabrications and dismissed by the system. For example, the Spanish Inquisition trialed 3687 people for witchcraft from 1560 to 1700, of which only 101 were found guilty.&lt;ref&gt;G. Parker, ‘some recent work on the inquisition in Spain and Italy ’, Journal of Modern History 54 (London, 1982) P.529&lt;/ref&gt; Other estimates of trial-conviction ratio for witchcraft are even lower.

A common mistake in inquisitorial Historiography has been to report the number of trials as number of convictions, or even of executions.&lt;ref&gt;J. Marchant, A Review of the Bloody Tribunal (1770)&lt;/ref&gt; Another common mistake has been to assume that the elevated number of trials indicated an active prosecution and search by the inquisitors instead of cases brought to them, or to assume a high ratio of conviction per trial instead of reading through the entire sentences. The mistake comes from the high trial-conviction ratio in cases of heresy observed in Northern Europe in the same period, where verdict was not based on a system but left to individual discretion.&lt;ref&gt;Elvira, Roca Barea María, and Arcadi Espada. Imperiofobia Y Leyenda Negro: Roma, Rusia, Estados UNIDO Y El Imperio Español. Madrid: Siruela, 201&lt;/ref&gt;

====Multiple Charges====
Another factor that contributed to the high number of inquisitorial investigations was this same low conviction ratio. Due to its reputation of-relative- impartiality during its first two centuries of existence, Spanish citizens preferred the inquisitorial tribunal to the secular courts and presented their cases to them whenever possible. Those held in secular prisons also did all they could to be transferred ti Inquisitorial prisons, since prisoners of the inquisitions had rights while those of the king did not. As such, defendants accused of civil infractions would blaspheme or self accuse of false conversion to be transferred to the Inquisition courts, which eventually made the Inquisitors elevate a complain to the king.&lt;ref&gt;Railings, Helen, The Spanish Inquisition, Blackwell Publishing (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor that contributes to inflate the number of trials the inquisition is reported to have conducted, especially regarding witchcraft and fasle conversions, were the groups of accusations that often were investigated together. Acusers tended to throw "witchcraft" or other vague accusations into the mix, along with legitimate claims. Those cases in which witchcraft was trialed along with other, serious accusations, are sometime reported as "trials of witchcraft by the inquisition". For example, [[Eleno de Céspedes]] was accused of witchcraft during his trial for "bigamy", and is often reported as "having been trialed for witchcraft by the inquisition", even if he was taken to court for different reasons, the accusation of witchcraft was thrown in during the trial by one of the court´s witnesses, recorded as the system demanded, and then promptly dismissed by the court as baseless and absurd.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Briggs, Witches and Neighbors: The Social and Cultural Context of European Witchcraft, Harper Collins, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of the Inquisitor===
In popular culture the Inquisitor is an all, powerful, evil and sadistic entity. Even serious work who didn´t take the time to investigate the Spanish legal system as a whole tend to make the mistake of attributing him more power in the final verdict than he held. As it has been estated, the Inquisitorial court was a court regulated by a system, not by a person, much like courts work in [[Judiciary of France|modern European democracies]]. The inquisition was merely a civil servant, a bureocrat. As such the inquisitor had no power to introduce his own judgment in the trials, he had power only to apply the law. This had its problems, but was more beneficial than not.

A popular example of this can be found in [[Alonso de Salazar Frías]]´s intervention in the[[Basque witch trials|case of the Witches of Zurragamurdi]], one of the few cases of witchcraft in Spain that ended in actual execution. During the trial, the Inquisitor Frías, whom like most educated Spaniards did not believe in witchcraft, refused to condemn the witches despite their voluntary confessions-no torture was used. He declared that "These women think that they can turn into ravens, but they are just mentally ill!" and " There were no witches in Spain until the French started talking and writing about them". However, he didn't have the power to arbitrary declare them innocent. The case was taken to the General-Inquisitor in Madrid, who agreed with Frías in considering that the women were not witches, just mentally disturbed. However, and even though both men considered that the women were not guilty, they had to be convicted because the neighbors refused to drop the charges and the legal requisites for conviction of any crime-voluntary confession of it combined with unanimous and consistent testimony from a lot of eyes witnesses- had been met. The judges had no right to make an arbitrary decision over the written law.&lt;ref&gt;Henningsen, Gustav (1980). The Witches' Advocate: Basque Witchcraft and the Spanish Inquisition (1609-1614). Reno: University of Nevada Press. {{ISBN|0-87417-056-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This shows both the bureocratic and modern nature of the SPanish Inquisition when compared to other European courts, and the limited power the inquisitors themselves held.

'''Callisthenes of Olynthus''' (({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|l|ɪ|s|θ|ə|ˌ|n|iː|z}}); {{lang-grc-gre|Καλλισθένης}}; c. 360 – 327 BC)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/articles/person/callisthenes-of-olynthus/|title=Callisthenes of Olynthus - Livius|website=www.livius.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Callisthenes}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a well-connected [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[historian]] in Macedon who accompanied Alexander the Great during the Asiatic expedition. The philosopher [[Aristotle]] was Callisthenes' great uncle.

==Early life==
His mother Hero was the niece of Aristotle, and daughter of [[Proxenus of Atarneus]] and [[Arimneste]], which made Callisthenes the great-nephew of Aristotle by his sister [[Arimneste]], Callisthenes' grandmother. They first met when Aristotle tutored [[Alexander the Great]]. 

==Career==
Through his great-uncle's influence, he was later appointed to attend Alexander the Great on his [[Alexander the Great's conquest of Persia|Asiatic expedition]] as the official historian.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Life of Greece|last = Durant|first = Will|publisher = Simon and Schuster|year = 1939|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 550|work = The Story of Civilization|volume = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first years of Alexander's campaign in Asia, Callisthenes showered praises upon the [[Macedon]]ian conqueror.  As the king and army penetrated further into Asia, however, Callisthenes' tone began to change.  He began to sharply criticize Alexander's adoption of [[Ancient Persia|Persian]] customs, with special scorn for Alexander's growing desire that those who presented themselves before him perform the servile ceremony of [[proskynesis]], a physical act of submission. In the end, Alexander did not continue the practice. 

==Death==
Callisthenes was later implicated by his former pupil and page to Alexander, [[Hermolaus of Macedon]] in a treasonous conspiracy to assassinate the king. He was thrown into prison where he died seven months later&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; from torture or disease. This event brought Alexander's relationship with Aristotle to a close.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

His death was commemorated in a special treatise (''Callisthenes or a Treatise on Grief'') by his friend [[Theophrastus]], whose acquaintance he made during a visit to [[Athens]].  There are nevertheless several different accounts of how he was executed.  [[Crucifixion]] is the method suggested by [[Ptolemy]], but [[Chares of Mytilene]] and [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia|Aristobulos]] agree that he died of natural causes while in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0585.html William Smith (ed.), ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' (1870), vol. 1, page 576] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019132956/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0585.html |date=2012-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
Callisthenes wrote an account of Alexander's expedition up to the time of his own execution, a history of Greece from the [[Peace of Antalcidas]] (387 BC) to the start of the [[Third Sacred War|Phocian war]], a history of the Phocian war (356 BC - 346 BC), and other works, all of which have perished.  However, his account of Alexander's expedition was preserved long enough to be mined as a direct or indirect source for other histories that have survived. [[Polybius]] scolds Callisthenes for his poor descriptions of the battles of Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, XII.17 "Polybius dedicated to Callisthenes a whole chapter in his 12th book called ''"On the Inexperience of Callisthenes as to the Provision of Deeds of War"''&lt;/ref&gt;

A quantity of the more legendary material coalesced into a text known as the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'', the basis of all the Alexander legends of the [[Middle Ages]], originated during the time of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]], but in its present form belongs to the 3rd century AD. Its author is usually known as '''pseudo-Callisthenes''', although in the Latin translation by [[Julius Valerius Alexander Polemius]] (beginning of the 4th century) it is ascribed to a certain Aesopus; Aristotle, Antisthenes, Onesicritus and [[Arrian]] have also been credited with the authorship.

There are also Syrian, Armenian and Slavonic versions, in addition to four [[Greek language|Greek]] versions (two in prose and two in verse) in the Middle Ages (see [[Karl Krumbacher|Krumbacher]], ''Geschichte der byzantinischen Literatur'', 1897, p.&amp;nbsp;849). [[Julius Valerius Alexander Polemius|Valerius]]'s translation was completely superseded by that of Leo, arch-priest of Naples in the 10th century, the so-called ''Historia de Preliis''.

{{italic title}}
The '''''Corpus Inscriptionum Etruscarum''''' (Body of Etruscan inscriptions) is a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] texts, collected by Karl Pauli and his followers since 1885. After the death of [[:sv:Olof August Danielsson|Olof August Danielsson]] in 1933, this collection was passed on to the [[Uppsala University Library]].

The ''CIE'' serves as a valuable reference index for many Etruscan texts, using a simple number system. For example, ''CIE'' 6 refers to the inscription ''mi avileś apianaś'' (I [am] of Avile Apiana.). There are other indices in existence as well.

'''David Cesarani''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (13 November 1956 – 25 October 2015) was an English historian who specialised in [[Jewish history]], especially [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="Haaretz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/1.682326|title=Prominent British Holocaust Historian David Cesarani Dies at 58|date=26 October 2015|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote several biographies, including ''[[Arthur Koestler]]: The Homeless Mind'' (1998).&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt;

==Early life and education==

Cesarani was born in London to Henry, a hairdresser, and Sylvia (née Packman).  An only child, he won a scholarship to [[Latymer Upper School]] in west London and went to [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], in 1976, where he gained a first in history. A master’s degree in Jewish history at [[Columbia University]], [[New York City|New York]], working with the scholar of Judaism [[Arthur Hertzberg]], shaped the rest of his career.  His doctorate at [[St Antony's College, Oxford]], looked into aspects of the history of the [[Interwar period|interwar]] [[History of the Jews in England|Anglo-Jewish community]].

Before he started his degree at Cambridge, Cesarani spent a gap year in Israel which involved working at a [[kibbutz]]. His involvement in [[Zionism]] was to be accompanied by nagging doubts that arose from this period, where he noted local Arabs were not accorded respect. He recalled the shock he felt on discovering that the kibbutzniks had not been forthcoming about the history of the fields where he worked, near [[Qaqun]].&lt;ref&gt;David Cesarani, 'Autobiographical Reflections on Writing History, the Holocaust and Hairdressing,' in Michael R.

==Academic career==
Cesarani held positions at the [[University of Leeds]], [[Queen Mary University of London]] and at the [[Wiener Library]] in London, where he was director for two periods in the 1990s.  He was [[Professor]] of Modern Jewish history at the [[University of Southampton]] from 2000 to 2004, and Research Professor in History at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]], from 2004 until his death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/26/david-cesarani The Guardian, Obituary, published 26 October 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Here he helped establish and direct the Holocaust Research Centre.

==The Arendt affair==
{{Coatrack|date=October 2018}}
In 2005, he published a biography of SS-''[[Obersturmbannführer]]'' [[Adolf Eichmann]]; titled ''Eichmann: His Life and Crimes'', it featured hitherto unused primary source material. The book has been noted in particular for its evaluation of [[Hannah Arendt]]'s account of Eichmann's arrest, trial and sentence.&lt;ref name=nyt-obit/&gt; In a review for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', British historian [[Ian Kershaw]] wrote that "a central purpose of Cesarani's penetrating and compelling study is to show how wrong Arendt's influential interpretation of Eichmann was, and how misleading the phrase 'banality of evil' has proved." A key charge of Cesarani was that Arendt's account of Eichmann's trial was hindered by prejudice towards the Eastern European Jewish background of the prosecutor, [[Gideon Hausner]].

Kershaw commended Cesarani's "expert guidance through the web of lies, deceit, and contradictions built into Eichmann's various tendentious accounts of his life and career. He hammers home the message that, far from being merely an industrious underling dispassionately implementing orders, Eichmann was a convinced anti-Semitic ideologue in a key position where he himself could initiate action and make things happen." He described Cesarani's "revision of Arendt's interpretation" of Eichmann as "an unideological bureaucrat diligently doing his job, the archetypal middle-manager on the lookout for career advancement, but otherwise without motive – 'the classic desk-killer who mechanically and thoughtlessly arranged for millions to die as the culmination of a routinised and sanitised process or destruction'" as "surely correct".&lt;ref name = "Telegraph review"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3621218/Nothing-banal-about-his-evil.html|title= Nothing banal about his evil|last=Kershaw |first=Ian |date= 25 July 2004 |newspaper= The Telegraph|accessdate= 6 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticising an influential and much-admired writer as Hannah Arendt raised controversy. An editor of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', Barry Gewen, while praising the "factual density" in Cesarani's book, dismissed what he described as Cesarani's "hostility" to Arendt and even suggested that Cesarani needed to "tear Arendt down to make space for himself." He further said that "Cesarani believes his details add up to a portrait at odds with Arendt's banal bureaucrat, but what is striking is how far his research goes to reinforce her fundamental arguments." He characterised Cesarani's statement, "She had much in common with Eichmann. There were two people in the courtroom who looked up to the German-born judges as the best of Germany and looked down on the prosecutor as a miserable Ostjude: one was Eichmann and the other was Hannah Arendt," as a "slur" which "reveals a writer in control neither of his material nor of himself."&lt;ref name = "NYT review"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/books/review/14gewen.html |title= The Everyman of Genocide |last= Gewen |first= Barry |date= 14 May 2006 |newspaper= The New York Times |accessdate= 27 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public activism==

===Holocaust consciousness===
Cesarani was a member of the [[Home Office]]' [[Holocaust Memorial Day (UK)|Holocaust Memorial Day]] Strategic Group and was once Director of the AHRC Parkes Centre, part of the [[Parkes Institute]] for the Study of Jewish/non-Jewish Relations. He was co-editor of the journal ''[[Patterns of Prejudice]]'' and the Parkes-Wiener Series of books on Jewish Studies (published by Vallentine-Mitchell). In February 2005, Cesarani was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for "services to Holocaust Education and advising the government with regard to the establishment of Holocaust Memorial Day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ushmm.org/research/center/fellowship/fellows/fellow.php?year=2008&amp;content=cesarani| title = Professor David Cesarani| accessdate = 6 July 2012| publisher = United States Holocaust Memorial Museum| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120719051811/http://www.ushmm.org/research/center/fellowship/fellows/fellow.php?year=2008&amp;content=cesarani| archivedate = 19 July 2012| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cesarani campaigned against [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]]s such as [[David Irving]] and [[Gerald Fredrick Töben|Fredrick Töben]], alongside fellow academic [[Peter Longerich]]. With regards to Holocaust denial, he wrote that "the fractional loss of liberty entailed in penalising the expression of neo-Nazi views or Holocaust denial seems a small price to pay compared to what can follow if the far right is shielded all the way into power".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = David Cesarani: The limits of free speech|url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/03/race.austria|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[D. D. Guttenplan|David Guttenplan]] described Cesarani's position in the wake of the [[Irving v Penguin Books Ltd|Irving v Lipstadt trial]] as "more dangerous than anything David Irving has ever said or written."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guttenplan|first=David|title=The Holocaust on Trial: History, Justice and the David Irving Libel Case (2nd Edition)|year=2002|publisher=Granta|location=London|isbn=1-86207-486-0|pages=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli–Arab conflict and Zionism===
Cesarani believed that Israel's [[Right to exist#Israel|right to exist]] is unquestionable, and that "[d]enying the right of Israel to exist begs some serious questions."&lt;ref name="Crace"/&gt; He was strongly critical of academic and business boycotts against Israel in the United Kingdom. However he was also critical of Israeli government policy, conduct and expansionist sentiments.

He was an advisory editor of [[Engage (organisation)|Engage]], a web-based campaign that emerged from opposition to the AUT boycott. In his words Engage was "careful to stress that criticism of Israel's Government or Israeli society is not a priori anti-Semitic. What Engage objects to is the demonisation of Israel, the application of double standards intended to criminalise one state and those who support it, and the unique denial to the Jews of any right to nationhood." Cesarani decried anti-Semitic incidents and expressions in relation to the boycotts in British universities as well as the "apathy" of student bodies such as the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]]. Cesarani concluded "It should not be like this. It is possible to support the Palestinian struggle against the occupation and for a viable state without endorsing the murder of innocents or conspiracy theories about Jews. British universities are a meeting place of different nationalities and ethnic and faith groups. The boycott campaign, anti-Israel motions, double standards and violent rhetoric poison this precious environment."&lt;ref name="bds bs"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cesarani |first=David |title=The Left's 'anti-Semitism' can't go unchallenged |url=http://www.engageonline.org.uk/blog/article.php?id=470 |accessdate=6 November 2015 |newspaper=The Times |date=2 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615011329/http://www.engageonline.org.uk/blog/article.php?id=470 |archivedate=15 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cesarani rejected suggestions that incidents such as the attack on a Kosher shop in Paris following the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]] in January 2015 were a sign of universal anti-Semitism. He wrote that "The current hysteria about the 'rise of anti-semitism' and the flight of Jews from Europe is deeply regrettable. There is no 'wave' of anti-semitism." The basis of his argument was that Jews were not socially or legally isolated "as they were in the 1930s and 1940s, but find themselves enjoying unprecedented solidarity." He further emphasised that Jewish communities "on both sides of the English Channel rallied and continued to thrive" following targeted attacks by Palestinian Arab terrorists in the 1970s and 1980s and wrote that the "current press hyperbole shows not only ignorance about what the situation was like 70–80 years ago, but what it was like just 20–30 years before now."&lt;ref name="antisemitism wave"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cesarani|first=David|title=There Is No 'Wave' of Anti-Semitism|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/david-cesarani/anti-semitism-charlie-hebdo_b_6542550.html|accessdate=26 January 2015|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also attacked Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] for "fear mongering" and asserted that Jews, non-Jews and Muslims were standing "shoulder to shoulder" against a common terrorist threat.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KXlpvKTzSw&lt;/ref&gt;

He saw the controversy over the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] as being unimportant, and that it is used as a photo opportunity for the world's media. Of the wall itself "it's a concern if land is misappropriated from the Palestinians, or if Palestinian lives become intolerable, but its true significance is in the total disintegration of trust between Jews and Palestinians", though he also believed some reactions to the barrier have been under-reported, for example that "some Arab towns, especially in southern Galilee, have welcomed the wall as a means of preventing Palestinians entering Israeli towns and adding to the unemployment and instability."&lt;ref name="Crace"/&gt;

==Death==
David Cesarani died on 26 October 2015, after he had had surgery the previous month to remove a cancerous spinal tumour. He had been diagnosed with the cancer in July 2015. He spent the week before his operation checking the footnotes for his final book at the [[Institute of Historical Research]] in London, and was still writing ten days before his death. He had completed two works: ''Final Solution: The Fate of the Jews 1933–1949'' and ''Disraeli: The Novel Politician'' which were both scheduled to be published in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishlives.org/content/obiturary-times-uk-david-cesarani |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117010032/http://www.jewishlives.org/content/obiturary-times-uk-david-cesarani |archivedate=17 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francisco Ferreira Drummond''' (21 January 1796 – 9 November 1858) was a historian, [[Paleography|palaeograph]], musician and politician from a locality of [[Vila de São Sebastião]] on the island of [[Terceira]], the Portuguese [[Azores]].  He was a historic publisher occupying a better part of his work with documenting the [[History of the Azores]] (primarily from the island of Terceira), where he was responsible for writing the ''Anais da Ilha Terceira'' (''''Annals of the island of Terceira'''').

==Biography==
Francisco Ferreira Drummond was born in the modern parish of Vila de São Sebastião, [[Terceira Island|Terceira]].  He was the son of Tomé Ferreira Drumond, a wealthy landowner, and his wife Rita de Cássia, who delivered Francisco at home on 21 January 1796 and baptized six days later.

The Drummond family was intimately linked to the first educational classes and administrators of the Vila de São Sebastião: Tomé would hold the presidency in 1821, and his older brother, José Ferreira Drummond, was the Ordinance Captain, dominating the local political life for various decades.

Francisco, since his infancy, revealed a vocation in languages and music, under the influence of his paternal uncle the Kings-Master Francisco Machado Drummond. Concluding his early primary instruction, he studied [[Latin]], logic and rhetoric. His musical abilities provided his with a nomination to the organists chair at the Parochial Church in Praia da Vitória in 1811 (at the time he was 18 years old), a position he retained until his death. Complimenting this role, he was an organ craftsman assistant, and called on to perform maintenance on organs throughout the island.

===Liberal Wars===
With the elevation of the São Sebastião to the status of municipality, he was elected secretary for the municipal chamber in 1822. It was also in this year that the new Portuguese constitutional framework would establish a liberal form of government. In the following year, the Vila-Francada in Portugal (1823) ushered in political persecution of constitutionalists, in which Terceira was not immune. Francisco Ferreira, as with others, saw themselves forced to escape, on 27 July, to the island of Santa Maria, then São Miguel and Madeira, eventually terminating in Lisbon, where he remained exiled for less than a year. With the failure of Prince [[Miguel of Portugal|Miguel's]] Abrilada rebellion (30 April 1824), Francisco was able to return to Terceira.  From there he participated in the struggles of the [[Liberal Wars|Portuguese Civil War]] (1828–1834), which he later described in the ''Anais da Ilha Terceira''.

===Later life===
Returning to São Sebastião, he took on the position of secretary for orphans, then administrative secretary for the municipal council and [[notary]]. In 1836, he was elected President of the municipal government, a position he held for three years. During his tenure he defended the interests of an autonomous municipality, as well as guaranteeing the construction of aqueducts and channels to transport potable waters from the springs near Cabrito for mills. At the time it was the largest hydraulic public work in Terceira, and one of the largest in the Azores.

In 1839, he was elected Solicitor General for the Junta Geral, while exercising for many more years the role of ombudsman for the Santa Casa da Misericórdia. Ferreira Drummond also supported the fight against the extinction of the municipality of São Sebastião, and through his activity was able to delay its implementation from 24 October 1855 until 1 April 1870.

He died at the age of 63, in the home offered by the Santa Casa da Misericórdia along the Travessa da Misericórdia, in the Vila de São Sebastião.

In 1951, Francisco Ferreira Drummond was honoured a small monument in Rossio, Vila de S. Sebastião.

'''Gunnar Svante Paulsson''' (also known as '''Steve Paulsson'''&lt;ref name=toi/&gt;) is a Swedish-born Canadian historian, university lecturer and author who has taught in Britain, Canada, Germany and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{worldcat|id=lccn-n00051856}}&lt;/ref&gt; He specializes in history of [[The Holocaust]] and has been described as "an expert on that period".&lt;ref name=toi&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/hitler-joins-us-gun-debate/|title=Hitler joins US gun debate|last=Geller|first=Adam|date=23 March 2013|work=Times of Israel|access-date=8 June 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his 2002 book, ''[[Secret City: The Hidden Jews of Warsaw 1940-1945]]''.

==Education and career==
Paulsson graduated from [[Carleton University]] in 1968 with a degree in psychology, and worked in an unrelated career until 1989, when he began graduate study in history at the [[University of Toronto]].  He completed a [[D.Phil.]] ([[Ph.D.]]) in Modern History in 1998 at [[Oxford University]], while simultaneously holding the position of Lecturer and Director of the Stanley Burton Centre for Holocaust Studies at the [[University of Leicester]] in 1994–98.  He then served as the Senior Historian in the Holocaust Exhibition Project Office at the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London in 1998–2000. He was the Koerner visiting fellow and lecturer at the [[Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies]], and Pearl Resnick fellow at the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies at the [[US Holocaust Memorial Museum]]. He has also taught at the [[University of Toronto]], [[Viadrina University]] and the [[University of Siena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/default/e/B001HCV83S/|title=Amazon.com: Gunnar S.

Paulsson is best known for his book, ''Secret City: The Hidden Jews of Warsaw 1940-1945'' (Yale University Press, 2002), and his article, "The Bridge over the Øresund: the Historiography on the Expulsion of the Jews from Denmark, 1943."

==''Secret City''==
Paulsson's book, ''[[Secret City: The Hidden Jews of Warsaw 1940-1945|Secret City]]'', is a social history of the Jews who escaped from the Warsaw ghetto and tried to survive, living illegally "on the Aryan side". In its original form as his doctoral thesis, it was awarded the Franklin Prize in Contemporary History (1998). The English edition was awarded the biennial PSA/Orbis (now Kulczycki Prize) in 2004, and the Polish edition, ''Utajone Miasto: Żydzi po "aryjskiej" stronie Warszawy 1940-1945'' (Znak, 2007) was awarded the inaugural Moczarski Prize ''[[:pl:Nagroda Historyczna im.

'''Historical ecology''' is a research program that focuses on the interactions between [[human]]s and their environment over long-term periods of time, typically over the course of centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Crumley, C. L. (1987). Historical ecology. In ''Regional dynamics: Burgundian landscapes in historical perspective'', eds. C. L. Crumley, W. H. Marquardt, pp. 237-264. New York:Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to carry out this work, historical ecologists synthesize long-series data collected by practitioners in diverse fields.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Scholl, Michael D., D. Seth Murray and Carole L. Crumley

&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than concentrating on one specific event, historical ecology aims to study and understand this interaction across both time and space in order to gain a full understanding of its cumulative effects. Through this interplay, humans adapt to ''and'' shape the environment, continuously contributing to [[landscape]] transformation. Historical ecologists recognize that humans have had world-wide influences, impact landscape in dissimilar ways which increase or decrease species diversity, and that a holistic perspective is critical to be able to understand that system.&lt;ref name="Balee1"&gt;Balée, W. (1998). "Historical ecology: Premises and postulates". In W. Balée (Ed.), Advances in Historical Ecology, (pp 13-29). Columbia University Press, New York. {{ISBN|0-231-10633-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piecing together landscapes requires a sometimes difficult union between [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s, close attention to geographic and temporal scales, a knowledge of the range of human ecological complexity, and the presentation of findings in a way that is useful to researchers in many fields.&lt;ref&gt;Crumley, Carole L.

1994. Historical Ecology:a Multidimensional Ecological Orientation. In Historical Ecology: Cultural Knowledge and Changing Landscapes, ed. C.L. Crumley, pp. 1-16. Santa Fe: School  of American Research Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Those tasks require theory and methods drawn from [[geography]], [[biology]], [[ecology]], [[history]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and other disciplines. Common methods include historical research, climatological reconstructions, plant and animal surveys, archaeological excavations, [[ethnography|ethnographic interviews]], and landscape reconstructions.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==History==
The discipline has several sites of origins by researchers who shared a common interest in the problem of ecology and history, but with a diversity of approaches.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; [[Edward Smith Deevey, Jr.]] used the term in the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deevey | first1 = E. S. | year = 1964 | title = General and historical ecology | url = | journal = BioScience | volume = 14 | issue = 7| pages = 33–35 | doi=10.2307/1293234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to describe a methodology that had been in long development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deevey | first1 = E. S. | year = 1944 | title = Analysis and Mexican archaeology: an attempt to apply the method | url = | journal = American Antiquity | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 135–149 | doi=10.2307/275110}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Deevey wished to bring together the practices of "general ecology" which was studied in an experimental laboratory, with a "historical ecology" which relied on  evidence collected through fieldwork. For example, Deevey used [[radiocarbon dating]] to reconcile biologists’ successions of plants and animals with the sequences of [[material culture]] and sites discovered by archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deevey | first1 = E. S. | year = 1969 | title = Coaxing history to conduct experiments | url = | journal = BioScience | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 40–43 | doi=10.2307/1294629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, members of the history department at the [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]] organized a lecture series entitled "Historical Ecology: Essays on Environment and Social Change"&lt;ref&gt;Bilsky, L. J., ed. (1980) ''Historical ecology: essays on environment and social change''. Port Washington, NY: Kenniket Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors noted the public’s concerns with pollution and dwindling natural resources, and they began a dialogue between researchers with specialties which spanned the social sciences. The papers highlighted the importance of understanding social and political structures,  personal identities, perceptions of nature, and the multiplicity of solutions for environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;Moneyhon, C. H. (1980). Introduction. In ''Historical ecology: essays on environment and social change''.ed. L. J. Bilsky, pp. 3-8. Port Washington, NY, Kenniket Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of historical ecology as a coherent discipline was driven by a number of long-term research projects in historical ecology of tropical, temperate and arctic environments:

E.S. Deevey's Historical Ecology of the Maya Project (1973-1984) was carried out by archaeologists and biologists who combined data from lake sediments, settlement patterns, and material from excavations in the central [[Petén District]] of [[Guatemala]] to refute the hypotheses that a collapse of Mayan urban areas was instigated by faltering food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rice | first1 = D. | last2 = Rice | first2 = P. | year = 1984 | title = Lessons from the Maya | url = | journal = Latin American Research Review | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 7–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carole L. Crumley's Burgundian Landscape Project (1974–present) is carried out by a multidisciplinary research team aimed at identifying the multiple factors which have contributed to the long-term durability of the agricultural economy of [[Burgundy, France]].&lt;ref&gt;Carole L. Crumley, W. H. Marquardt (1987) ''Regional Dynamics: Burgundian Landscapes in Historical Perspective''. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas H. McGovern's Inuit-Norse Project (1976–present) uses archaeology, environmental reconstruction, and textual analysis to examine the changing ecology of Nordic colonizers and indigenous peoples in [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], [[Faeroes]], and [[Shetland]].&lt;ref&gt;McGovern, T. 1981.

Cambridge: Cambridge  University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the approaches to historical ecology have been expanded to include coastal and marine environments:

Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary Project (1984–present) examines [[Massachusetts]], USA cod fishing in the 17th through 19th centuries through historical records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenberg | first1 = A.A. | last2 = Bolster | first2 = W.J. | last3 = Alexander | first3 = K.E. | last4 = Leavenworth | first4 = W.B. | last5 = Cooper | first5 = A.B. | last6 = McKenzie | first6 = M.G. | year = 2005 | title = The history of ocean resources: modeling cod biomass using historical records | doi = 10.1890/1540-9295(2005)003[0078:thoorm]2.0.co;2 | journal = Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 84–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Florida Keys Coral Reef Eco-region Project (1990–present) researchers at the [[Scripps Institute of Oceanography]] are examining archival records including natural history descriptions, maps and charts, family and personal papers, and state and colonial records in order to understand the impact of over-fishing and habitat loss in the [[Florida Keys]], USA which contains the third largest coral reef in the world.

Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Historical Ecology (2008–present) seeks to collect relevant historical data on fishing, whaling, and trade of the furs of aquatic animals in order form a baseline for environmental restorations of the [[California]], USA coast.&lt;ref&gt;Selbie, Hugo (2008) Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Historical Ecology Phase 1: Historical Sources Survey Report.

==Relations with other disciplines==

[[File:Idaho Falls Idaho Temple 2.jpeg|thumb|Manmade nature: In [[Idaho Falls, Idaho]], these waterfalls replaced naturally occurring ones]]
Historical ecology is interdisciplinary in principle; at the same time, it borrows heavily from the rich intellectual history of [[environmental anthropology]]. Western scholars have known since the time of [[Plato]] that the history of environmental changes cannot be separated from human history. Several ideas have been used to describe human interaction with the environment, the first of which is the concept of the [[Great Chain of Being]], or inherent design in nature. In this, all forms of life are ordered, with Humanity as the highest being, due to its knowledge and ability to modify nature. This lends to the concept of another nature, a manmade nature, which involves design or modification by humans, as opposed to design inherent in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Glacken, C. (1956). Changing ideas of the habitable world. In W. L. Thomas (Ed.), Man's role in changing the phase of the Earth (pp 73). Chicago: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in environmental transformation continued to increase in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, resulting in a series of new intellectual approaches. One of these approaches was [[environmental determinism]], developed by geographer [[Friedrich Ratzel]]. This view held that it is not social conditions, but environmental conditions, which determine the culture of a population. Ratzsel also viewed humans as restricted by nature, for their behaviors are limited to and defined by their environment. A later approach was the historical viewpoint of [[Franz Boas]] which refuted environmental determinism, claiming that it is not nature, but specifics of history, that shape human cultures. This approach recognized that although the environment may place limitations on societies, every environment will impact each culture differently. [[Julian Steward]]'s [[cultural ecology]] is considered a fusion of environmental determinism and Boas' historical approach. Steward felt it was neither nature nor culture that had the most impact on a population, but instead, the mode of subsistence used in a given environment.

Anthropologist [[Roy Rappaport]] introduced the field of ecological anthropology in a deliberate attempt to move away from cultural ecology. Studies in ecological anthropology borrow heavily from the natural sciences, in particular, the concept of the ecosystem from [[systems ecology]]. In this approach, also called systems theory, ecosystems are seen as self-regulating, and as returning to a state of equilibrium. This theory views human populations as static and as acting in harmony with the environment.&lt;ref name="balee2"&gt;Balée, W. (2006). "The research program of historical ecology". Annual Review of Anthropology. Vol. 35, pp5.1-5.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The revisions of anthropologist [[Eric Wolf]] and others are especially pertinent to the development of historical ecology. These revisions and related critiques of environmental anthropology undertook to take into account the temporal and spatial dimensions of history and cultures, rather than continuing to view populations as static. These critiques led to the development of historical ecology by revealing the need to consider the historical, cultural, and evolutionary nature of landscapes and societies. Thus, historical ecology as a research program developed to allow for the examination of all types of societies, simple or complex, and their interactions with the environment over [[Philosophy of space and time|space and time]].

==Landscapes in historical ecology==

In historical ecology, the [[landscape]] is defined as an area of interaction between human culture and the non-human environment.  The landscape is a perpetually changing, physical manifestation of history.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, T. G. (2000). Landscape, ecology and ecosystems management. Retrieved March 15, 2008, from Cooperative Extension Service, University of Kentucky Web site: http://www.ca.uky.edu/agc/pubs/for/for76/for76.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Historical ecology revises the notion of the [[ecosystem]] and replaces it with the landscape. While an ecosystem is static and cyclic, a landscape is historical. While the ecosystem concept views the environment as always trying to return to a state of equilibrium, the landscape concept considers "landscape transformation" to be a process of evolution. Landscapes do not return to a state of equilibrium, but are palimpsests of successive disturbances over time.&lt;ref name=balee2 /&gt; The use of "landscape" instead of "ecosystem" as the core unit of analysis lies at the heart of historical ecology.

[[File:Carl O. Sauer.jpg|thumb|left|Geographer Carl O. Sauer]]
Various individuals and schools of thought have informed the idea of the landscape as historical ecologists conceive of it. The Old English words ''landskift'', ''landscipe'' or ''landscaef'' refer to environments that have been altered by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Calder, W.'', 1981 Beyond the View - our changing landscapes''. Inkata Press, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, J.B., 1986, "The vernacular landscape", in Penning-Rowsell, E.C. &amp; D. Lowenthal, ''Landscape Meanings and Values'', Allen &amp; Unwin, London, p 65-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = James | first1 = P.E. | year = 1934 | title = The terminology of regional description | url = | journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 78–79 | doi=10.1080/00045603409357125}}&lt;/ref&gt; As this etymology demonstrates, landscapes have been conceived of as related to human culture since at least the 5th century CE. Cultural and historical geographers have had a more recent influence. They adopted this idea from nineteenth-century German architects, gardeners, and landscape painters in Europe, Australia, and North America.&lt;ref name=Olwig&gt;Olwig, K (2002). ''Landscape, nature, and the body politic''. Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Landscapes are not only physical objects, but also "forms of knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Carol. 1991. ''On Site: Architectural Preoccupations.'' Princeton: Princeton Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Landscapes have cultural meanings, for example, the sacredness in many cultures of burial grounds. This recognition of landscapes as forms of knowledge is central to historical ecology, which studies landscapes from an anthropocentric perspective.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt;

The idea of the cultural landscape is directly attributed to American geographer [[Carl Sauer]]. Sauer's theories developed as a critique of environmental determinism, which was a popular theory in the early twentieth century. Sauer's pioneering 1925 paper "The Morphology of Landscape" is now fundamental to many disciplines and defines the domain. In this, the term landscape is used in a geographical sense to mean an arbitrarily selected section of reality; morphology means the conceptual and methodological processes for altering it. Hence to Sauer, wherever humans lived and impacted the environment, landscapes with determinate histories resulted.&lt;ref name="Kenzer, M. S. 1985"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kenzer | first1 = M. S. | year = 1985 | title = Milieu and the 'intellectual landscape': Carl O. Sauer's undergraduate heritage | url = | journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers | volume = 75 | issue = 2| pages = 258–270 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1985.tb00085.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perception of the landscape in historical ecology differs from other disciplines, such as [[landscape ecology]]. Landscape ecologists often attribute the depletion of biodiversity to human disturbance. Historical ecologists recognize that this is not always true. These changes are due to multiple factors that contribute to the ever-changing landscape. Landscape ecology still focuses on areas defined as ecosystems.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = M. G. | year = 2005 | title = Landscape ecology in North America: Past, present and future | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 86 | issue = 8| pages = 1967–1974 | doi=10.1890/04-0890}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, the ecosystem perpetually returns to a state of equilibrium. In contrast, historical ecologists view the landscape as perpetually changing. Landscape ecologists view noncyclical human events and natural disasters as external influences, while historical ecologists view disturbances as an integral part of the landscape's history. It is this integration of the concept of disturbance and history that allows for landscape to be viewed as [[palimpsest]]s, representing successive layers of change, rather than as static entities.

Historical ecologists recognize that landscapes undergo continuous alteration over time and these modifications are part of that landscape's history. Historical ecology recognizes that there is a primary and a secondary succession that occurs in the landscape. These successions should be understood without a preconceived bias against humanity. Landscape transformations are ecological successions driven by human impacts.  Primary landscape transformations occur when human activity results in a complete turnover of species and major [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] modifications in certain habitats while secondary landscape transformations involve human-induced changes in species proportions. The stages of landscape transformation demonstrate the history of a landscape. These stages can be brought on by humans or natural causes.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt; Parts of the Amazon rainforest exhibit different stages of landscape transformation such as the impact of indigenous [[slash-and-burn]] horticulture on plant species compositions. Such landscape transformation does not inherently reduce biodiversity or harm the environment. There are many cases in which human-mediated disturbance increases biodiversity as landscapes transform over time.

Historical ecology challenges the very notion of a pristine landscape, such as virgin rainforests.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt; The idea that the landscape of the New World was uninhabited and unchanged by those groups that did inhabit it was fundamental to the justifications of colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Denevan | first1 = William | year = 1992 | title = The Pristine Myth: The Landscape of the Americas in 1492 | url = | journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers | volume = 82 | issue = 3| pages = 369–385 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1992.tb01965.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, perceptions of landscape have profound consequences on the histories of societies and their interactions with the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Sluyter, Andrew (2002) [https://books.google.com/books/about/Colonialism_and_landscape.html?id=XA6R9UG2WxQC ''Colonialism and Landscape: Postcolonial Theory and Applications'']. New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; All landscapes have been altered by various organisms and mechanisms prior to human existence on Earth. Humans have always transformed the landscapes they inhabit, however, and today there are no landscapes on Earth that have not been affected by humans in some way.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt;

Human alterations have occurred in different phases, including the period prior to [[industrialization]]. These changes have been studied through the archeological record of modern humans and their history. The evidence that classless societies, like [[foragers]] and trekkers, were able to change a landscape was a breakthrough in historical ecology and anthropology as a whole.&lt;ref name=balee2/&gt; Using an approach that combines history, ecology, and anthropology, a landscape's history can be observed and deduced through the traces of the various mechanisms that have altered it, anthropogenic or otherwise. Understanding the unique nature of every landscape, in addition to relations among landscapes, and the forms which comprise the landscape, is key to understanding historical ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Sauer, C. 1969 (1925). "The morphology of landscape." In J. Leighly (Ed.), ''Land and Life'' (pp 312-343). Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human-mediated disturbance==

[[File:Dalbek P1210001.JPG|thumb|Man-made irrigation canal]]
''Homo sapiens'' have interacted with the environment throughout history, generating a long-lasting influence on landscapes worldwide. Humans sometimes actively change their landscapes, while at other times their actions alter landscapes through secondary effects. These changes are called human-mediated disturbances, and are effected through various mechanisms. These mechanisms vary; they may be detrimental in some cases, but advantageous in others.&lt;ref name="Kenzer, M. S. 1985"/&gt;

Both destructive and at times constructive, [[anthropogenic fire]] is the most immediately visible human-mediated disturbance, and without it, many landscapes would become denatured.&lt;ref&gt;Pyne, S.

Columbia University Press, New York. {{ISBN|0-231-10633-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have practiced [[controlled burn]]s of forests globally for thousands of years, shaping landscapes in order to better fit their needs. They burned vegetation and forests to create space for crops, sometimes resulting in higher levels of species diversity. Today, in the absence of indigenous populations who once practiced controlled burns (most notably in [[North America]] and [[Australia]]), naturally ignited wildfires have increased. In addition, there has been destabilization of "ecosystem after ecosystem, and there is good documentation to suggest fire exclusion by Europeans has led to floral and faunal extinctions."&lt;ref name="Kenzer, M. S. 1985"/&gt;

[[Invasive species|Biological invasions]] and the spread of [[pathogen]]s and [[disease]]s are two mechanisms that spread both inadvertently and purposefully. Biological invasions begin with introductions of foreign species or biota into an already existing environment. They can be spread by stowaways on ships or even as weapons in warfare.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; In some cases a new species may wreak havoc on a landscape, causing the loss of native species and destruction of the landscape. In other cases, the new species may fill a previously empty niche, and play a positive role. The spread of new pathogens, viruses, and diseases rarely have any positive effects; new pathogens and viruses sometimes destroy populations lacking immunities to those diseases. Some pathogens have the ability to transfer from one species to another, and may be spread as a secondary effect of a biological invasion.

Other mechanisms of human-mediated disturbances include [[water management]] and [[soil management]]. In [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] Europe, these have been recognized as ways of landscape alteration since the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Cicero]] noted that through fertilization, irrigation, and other activities, humans had essentially created a second world.&lt;ref name=balee2 /&gt; At present, [[fertilization]] yields larger, more productive harvests of crops, but also has had adverse effects on many landscapes, such as decreasing the diversity of plant species and adding pollutants to soils.

===Anthropogenic fire===

Anthropogenic fire is a mechanism of human-mediated disturbance, defined within historical ecology as a means of altering the landscape in a way that better suits human needs.&lt;ref name=Balee1 /&gt; The most common form of anthropogenic fire is controlled burns, or broadcast burning, which people have employed for thousands of years.  Forest fires and burning tend to carry negative connotations, yet controlled burns can have a favorable impact on landscape diversity, formation, and protection.

Broadcast burning alters the biota of a landscape. The immediate effect of a forest fire is a decrease in diversity. This negative impact associated with broadcast burning, however, is only temporary. Cycles of burning will allow the landscape to gradually increase in diversity. The time required for this change is dependent on the intensity, frequency, timing, and size of the controlled burns. After a few cycles, however, diversity increases. The adaptation to fire has shaped many of Earth's landscapes.

[[File:SwiddenFire6.jpg|thumb|A swidden fire, an example of a controlled burn]]
In addition to fostering diversity, controlled burns have helped change landscapes. These changes can range from grasslands to woodlands, from prairies or forest-steppes, to scrubland to forest. Whatever the case, these transformations increase diversity and engender landscapes more suitable to human needs, creating patches rich in utilitarian and natural resources.&lt;ref name=balee2 /&gt;

In addition to increasing diversity of landscapes, broadcast burning can militate against catastrophic wildfires. Forest fires gained a negative connotation because of cultural references to uncontrolled fires that take lives and destroy homes and properties. Controlled burns can decrease the risk of wildfires through the regular burning of undergrowth that would otherwise fuel rampant burning. Broadcast burning has helped to fireproof landscapes by burning off undergrowth and using up potential fuel, leaving little or no chance for a wildfire to be sparked by lightning.&lt;ref name=Balee1 /&gt;

Of all of the mechanisms of human-mediated disturbances, anthropogenic fire has become one of great interest to ecologists, geographers, soil scientists, and anthropologists alike. By studying the effects of anthropogenic fires, anthropologists have been able to identify landscape uses and requirements of past cultures. Ecologists became interested in the study of anthropogenic fire as to utilize methods from previous cultures to develop policies for regular burning. Geographers and soil scientists are interested in the utility of anthropic soils caused by burning in the past. The interest in anthropogenic fire came about in the wake of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. This time period included a mass migration from rural to urban areas, which decreased controlled burning in the countryside. This led to an increase in the frequency and strength of wildfires, thus initiating a need to develop proper prevention methods.&lt;ref name="Kenzer, M. S. 1985"/&gt; Historical ecology focuses on the impact on landscapes through human-mediated disturbances, once such being anthropogenic fire. It is a fusion of ecological, geographical, anthropological, and pedological interests.

===Biological invasions===
[[File:Lymantria dispar MHNT Chenille.jpg|thumb|''Lymantria dispar'']]
Biological invasions are composed of exotic biota that enter a landscape and replace species with which they share similarities in structure and ecological function. Because they multiply and grow quickly, invasive species can eliminate or greatly reduce existing flora and fauna by various mechanisms, such as direct competitive exclusion. Invasive species typically spread at a faster rate when they have no natural predators or when they fill an empty niche. These invasions often occur in a historical context and are classified as a type of human-mediated disturbance called human-mediated invasions.

Invasive species can be transported intentionally or accidentally. Many invasive species originate in shipping areas from where they are unintentionally transported to their new location. Sometimes human populations intentionally introduce species into new landscapes to serve various purposes, ranging from decoration to erosion control. These species can later become invasive and dramatically modify the landscape. It is important to note that not all exotic species are invasive; in fact, the majority of newly introduced species never become invasive.&lt;ref name=balee2 /&gt; Humans have on their migrations through the ages taken along plants of agricultural and medicinal value, so that the modern distribution of such favored species is a clear mapping of the routes they have traveled and the places they have settled.

One example of an invasive species that has had a significant impact on the landscape is the [[gypsy moth]] (''Lymantria dispar''). The foliage-feeding gypsy moth is originally from temperate [[Eurasia]]; it was intentionally brought to the United States by an [[entomologist]] in 1869. Many specimens escaped from captivity and have since changed the ecology of deciduous and coniferous forests in North America by defoliation. This has led not only to the loss of wildlife habitat, but also other forest services, such as carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling. After its initial introduction, the continued accidental transport of its larvae across North America has contributed to its population explosion.&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, P.C. and A.M. Liebhold. "Gypsy Moth." pp. 238-241 in: D. Simberloff and M. Rejmanek, eds., ''Encyclopedia of Biological Invasions'', University of California Press, Berkeley, California&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the medium of introduction, biological invasions have a considerable effect on the landscape. The goal of eliminating invasive species is not new; Plato wrote about the benefits of biotic and landscape diversity centuries ago. However, the notion of eliminating invasive species is difficult to define because there is no canonical length of time that a species must exist in a specific environment until it is no longer classified as invasive. European forestry defines plants as being archaeotypes if they existed in Europe before 1500 and neophytes if they arrived after 1500. This classification is still arbitrary and some species have unknown origins while others have become such key components of their landscape that they are best understood as keystone species. As a result, their removal would have an enormous impact on the landscape, but not necessarily cause a return to conditions that existed before the invasion.

===Epidemic disease===
[[File:San tribesman.jpg|thumb|A San Tribesman: Those living in dry climates have fewer intestinal parasites.]]
A clear relationship between nature and people is expressed through human disease. Infectious disease can thus be seen as another example of human-mediated disturbance as humans are [[Host (biology)|hosts]] for infectious diseases. Historically, evidence of epidemic diseases is associated with the beginnings of agriculture and sedentary communities. Previously, human populations were too small and mobile for most infections to become established as [[chronic diseases]]. Permanent settlements, due to agriculture, allowed for more inter-community interaction, enabling infections to develop as specifically human pathogens.&lt;ref name="Newson, L.A. 1998 pp 42-63"&gt;Newson, L.A. (1998) "A historical-ecological perspective on epidemic disease." In W. Balee (Ed.). ''Advances in historical ecology'' (pp 42-63). New York: Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|0-231-10633-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holistic and interdisciplinary approaches to the study of human disease have revealed a reciprocal relationship between humans and parasites. The variety of parasites found within the human body often reflects the diversity of the environment in which that individual resides. For instance, Bushmen and Australian [[Australian Aborigines|Aborigines]] have half as many intestinal parasites as African and Malaysian hunter-gatherers living in a species-rich tropical rainforest. Infectious diseases can be either chronic or acute, and epidemic or endemic, impacting the population in any given community to different extents. Thus, human-mediated disturbance can either increase or decrease species diversity in a landscape, causing a corresponding change in [[pathogenic diversity]].&lt;ref name="Newson, L.A. 1998 pp 42-63"/&gt;

===Transformation of waterways===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Amazonia5.jpg |thumb|Satellite view of anthropogenic transformation of [[Amazon basin]] waterways near the city of Manaus, Brazil along the north bank of the Negro River, 11 miles (18 km) above its confluence with the Amazon]] --&gt;

Historical ecologists postulate that landscape transformations have occurred throughout history, even before the dawn of [[western culture|western civilization]]. Human-mediated disturbances are predated by soil [[erosion]] and animals damming waterways which contributed to waterway transformations. [[Landscape]]s, in turn, were altered by waterway transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, M. (1992). ''So shall you reap''. New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; Historical ecology views the effects of human-mediated disturbances on waterway transformation as both subtle and drastic occurrences. Waterways have been modified by humans through the building of irrigation canals, expanding or narrowing waterways, and multiple other adjustments done for [[agricultural]] or transportation usage.

The evidence for past and present agricultural use of [[wetlands]] in [[Mesoamerica]] suggests an evolutionary sequence of landscape and [[waterway]] alteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Surian | first1 = N. | last2 = Rinaldi | first2 = M. | year = 2003 | title = Morphological response to river engineering and management in alluvial channels in Italy | journal = Geomorphology | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 307–326 | doi=10.1016/s0169-555x(02)00219-2| bibcode = 2003Geomo..50..307S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pre-Columbian]], indigenous agriculturalists developed capabilities with which to raise crops under a wide range of ecological conditions, giving rise to a multiplicity of altered, cultivated landscapes. The effects of waterway transformation were particularly evident in Mesoamerica, where agricultural practices ranged from swiddening to multicropped hydraulically transformed wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;Whitmore, T. M. &amp; Turner, B. L. II. (1992). "Landscapes of a cultivation in Mesoamerica on the eve of the conquest." ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', 82 (3), 402-425. {{jstor|2563353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manaus-Amazon-NASA.jpg|thumb|right|[[Manaus]], the largest city on the Amazon, as seen from a [[NASA]] satellite image, surrounded by the muddy Amazon River and the dark Rio Negro]]

Historical ecologists view the [[Amazon basin]] landscape as cultural and embodying social labor. The [[Amazon River]] has been altered by the local population for crop growth and water transportation. Previous research failed to account for human interaction with the Amazon landscape. Recent research, however, has demonstrated that the landscape has been manipulated by its [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] population over time. The continual, natural shifting of rivers, however, often masked the human disturbances in the course of rivers. As a result, the indigenous populations in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] are often overlooked for their ability to alter the land and the river.&lt;ref name=Raffles&gt;Raffles, H. The Amazon: a natural landscape?
http://www.india-seminar.com/2000/486/486%20raffles.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[waterway]] transformation has been successfully identified in the Amazon landscape. Clark Erickson observes that pre-Hispanic [[savanna]] peoples of the [[Bolivia]]n Amazon built an [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] landscape through the construction of raised fields, large settlement mounds, and earthen causeways. Erickson, on the basis of location, form, patterning, associations and ethnographic analogy, identified a particular form of earthwork, the zigzag structure, as fish [[weir]]s in the savanna of [[Baures]], Bolivia. The artificial zigzag structures were raised from the adjacent savanna and served as a means to harvest the fish who used them to migrate and spawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erickson | first1 = C. L. | year = 2000 | title = An artificial landscape-scale fishery in the Bolivian Amazon | url = http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/%7Ecerickso/fishweir/articles/Nature1.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = | pages = 190–193 | bibcode = 2000Natur.408..190E | doi = 10.1038/35041555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further evidence of waterway transformation is found in [[Igarapé]] [[Guariba]] in Brazil. It is an area in the Amazon basin where people have intervened in nature to change rivers and streams with dramatic results. Researcher Hugh Raffles notes that British [[naturalists]] [[Henry Walter Bates]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] noted waterway transformation as they sailed through a canal close to the town of Igarapé-Miri in 1848. Archival materials identifies that it had been dug out by slaves. In his studies he notes an abundance of documentary and anecdotal evidence which supports landscape transformation by the manipulation of waterways. Transformation continues in more recent times as noted when in 1961, a group of villagers from Igarapé Guariba cut a canal about two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) long across fields thick with tall [[papyrus]] grass and into dense tropical rain forest. The narrow canal and the stream that flowed into it have since formed a full-fledged river more than six hundred yards wide at its mouth, and the landscape in this part of the northern Brazilian state of [[Amapá]] was dramatically transformed.&lt;ref name=Raffles/&gt;

In general, with an increase in global population growth, comes an increase in the [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] transformation of waterways. The [[Sumer]]ians had created extensive irrigations by 4000 BC. As the population increased in the 3,000 years of agriculture, the ditches and canals increased in number. By the early 1900s, ditching, dredging, and diking had become common practice. This led to an increase in [[erosion]] which impacted the landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Siemens, A. H. (1983, April). "Wetland agriculture in Pre-Hispanic [[Mesoamerica]]." ''Geographical Review'', 73 (2), 166-181 {{jstor|214642}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human activities have affected the natural role of rivers and its communal value. These changes in waterways have impacted the floodplains, natural tidal patterns, and the surrounding land.&lt;ref&gt;Carlisle, B. &amp; Smith, T. (2007, October 15). "Reviving a river." Retrieved March 28, 2008, from Massachusetts Wetlands Restoration Program Web site: http://www.mass.gov/czm/coastlines/2006/ebbflow/river.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of understanding such transformation is it provides a more accurate understanding to long-standing popular and academic insights of the Amazon, as well as other [[ecological]] settings, as places where [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] populations have dealt with the forces of [[nature]]. Ecological landscapes have been portrayed as an [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], not a [[society]]. Recent studies supported by historical ecologists, however, understand that ecological landscape like the Amazon are biocultural, rather than simply natural and provide for a greater understanding of [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] transformation of both [[waterways]] and [[landscapes]].&lt;ref name=Raffles/&gt;

===Soil management===

[[Soil management]], or direct human interaction with the soil, is another mechanism of anthropogenic change studied by historical ecologists. Soil management can take place through rearranging soils, altering drainage patterns, and building large earthen formations. Consistent with the basic premises of historical ecology, it is recognized that anthropogenic soil management practices can have both positive and negative effects on local [[biodiversity]]. Some agricultural practices have led to organically and chemically impoverished soils. In the North American Midwest, industrial agriculture has led to a loss in [[topsoil]]. Salinization of the [[Euphrates River]] has occurred due to ancient Mesopotamian irrigation, and detrimental amounts of zinc have been deposited in the New Caliber River of Nigeria.&lt;ref name=Erickson&gt;Erickson, C. &amp; Balée, W. (2006). In time and complexity in historical ecology: Studies in the neotropical lowlands (pp 7-12). New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, soil management practices may not have any effect on soil fertility. The iconic mounds of the Hopewell Indians built in the Ohio River valley likely served a religious or ceremonial purpose, and show little evidence of changing soil fertility in the landscape.

The case of soil management in the Neotropics (including the Amazon) is a classic example of beneficial results of human-mediated disturbance. In this area, prehistoric peoples altered the texture and chemical composition of natural soils. The altered black and brown earths, known as Amazon Dark Earths, or [[Terra preta]], are actually much more fertile than unaltered surrounding soils.&lt;ref name=Erickson/&gt; Furthermore, the increased soil fertility improves the results of agriculture. Terra preta is characterized by the presence of [[charcoal]] in high concentrations, along with pottery shards and organic residues from plants, animal bones, and feces. It is also shows increased levels of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, zinc, and manganese; along with high levels of microorganic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Terra preta web site. School of geosciences and geography (Universität Bayreuth). Retrieved on April 5, 2008, from {{cite web |url=http://www.geo.uni-bayreuth.de/bodenkunde/terra_preta/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025170240/http://www.geo.uni-bayreuth.de/bodenkunde/terra_preta/ |archivedate=2005-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now accepted that these soils are a product of a labor-intensive technique termed [[slash-and-char]]. In contrast to the commonly known [[slash-and-burn]] technique, this uses a lower temperature burn that produces more charcoal than ashes. Research shows these soils were created by human activity between 9000 and 2500 years ago. Contemporary local farmers actively seek out and sell this dark earth, which covers around 10% of the Amazon basin. Harvesting Terra preta does not deplete it however, for it has the ability to regenerate at the rate of one centimeter per year by sequestering more carbon.&lt;ref name=sington&gt;Sington, D. (Director) (2002). Horizon: The secret of El Dorado [Videotape]. BBC Horizon Series. London: Dox Productions.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DirkvdM santa fe scorched.jpg|thumb|Scorched land resulting from slash-and-burn agriculture]]
Interest in and the study of Amazon dark earths was advanced with the work of Wim Sombroek. Sombroek's interest in soil fertility came from his childhood. He was born in the Netherlands and lived through the Dutch famine of 1944. His family subsided on a small plot of land that had been maintained and improved for generations. Sombroek's father, in turn, improved the land by sowing it with the ash and cinders from their home. Sombroek came across Terra preta in the 1950s and it reminded him of the soil from his childhood, inspiring him to study it further. Soil biologist from the University of Kansas William W. Woods is also a major figure in Terra preta research. Woods has made several key discoveries and his comprehensive bibliography on the subject doubles in size every decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marris | first1 = E. | year = 2006 | title = Putting the Carbon back: Black is the new green | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 442 | issue = | pages = 624–626 | doi=10.1038/442624a | pmid=16900176| bibcode = 2006Natur.442..624M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, forests are well known for having greater biodiversity than nearby savannas or grasslands. Thus, the creation of ‘forest islands’ in multiple locations can be considered a positive result of human activity. This is evident in the otherwise uniform savannas of Guinea and central Brazil that are punctured by scattered clumps of trees.&lt;ref&gt;Fairhead, J. &amp; Leach, M. (1996). ''Misreading the African landscape: Society and ecology in a forest-savanna mosaic.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  These clumps are the result of generations of intense resource management. Earth works and mounds formed by humans, such as the Ibibate mound complex in the Llanos de Mojos in Bolivia, are examples of built environments that have undergone landscape transformation and provide habitats for a greater number of species than the surrounding wetland areas.&lt;ref name=sington/&gt;  The forest islands in the Bolivian Amazon not only increase the local plant species diversity, but also enhance subsistence possibilities for the local people.

==Applied historical ecology==

Historical ecology involves an understanding of multiple fields of study such as archaeology and cultural history as well as ecological processes, species diversity, natural variability, and the impact of human-mediated disturbances. Having a broad understanding of landscapes allows historical ecology to be applied to various disciplines.   Studying past relationships between humans and landscapes can successfully aid land managers by helping develop holistic, environmentally rational, and historically accurate plans of action. As summarized in the postulates of historical ecology, humans play significant roles in the creation and destruction of landscapes as well as in ecosystem function. Through experience, many indigenous societies learned how to effectively alter their landscapes and biotic distributions. Modern societies, seeking to curtail the magnitude of their effects on the landscape, can use historical ecology to promote sustainability by learning from the past. Farmers in the Amazon region, for example, now utilize nutrient-rich terra preta to increase crop yields&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = German | first1 = L.A. | year = 2003 | title = Historical contingencies in the coevolution of environment and livelihood: contributions to the debate on Amazon Black Earth | url = http://www.soils.wisc.edu/soils/courses/875/14Exemplary(A).pdf | format = PDF | journal = Geoderma | volume = 111 | issue = | pages = 307–331 | doi=10.1016/s0016-7061(02)00270-7 | bibcode=2003Geode.111..307G}}&lt;/ref&gt; much like the indigenous societies that lived long before them.

Historical ecology can also aid in the goals of other fields of study. [[Conservation biology]] recognizes different types of land management processes, each attempting to maintain the landscape and biota in their present form. [[Restoration ecology]] restores sites to former function, structure, and components of biological diversity through active modification of the landscapes. Reclamation deals with shifting a degraded ecosystem back toward a higher value or use, but not necessarily to its original state. Replacement of an ecosystem would create an entirely new one. Revegetation involves new additions of biota into a landscape, not limited to the original inhabitants of an area.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, M.L., Gibbs, J.P. (2006) ''Fundamentals of Conservation Biology''. 3rd ed. (pp 252-276). Malden, Massachusetts, Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-3545-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each method can be enriched by the application of historical ecology and the past knowledge it supplies. The interdisciplinary nature of historical ecology would permit conservation biologists to create more effective and efficient landscape improvements. Reclamation and revegetation can use a historical perspective to determine what biota will be able to sustain large populations without threatening native biota of the landscape.

A tropical forest in particular needs to be studied extensively because it is a highly diverse, heterogeneous setting. Historical ecology can use archaeological sites within this setting to study past successes and failures of indigenous peoples.  The use of swidden fires in Laos is an example of historical ecology as used by current land managers in policy-making. Swidden fires were originally considered a source of habitat degradation. This conclusion led the Laos government to discourage farmers from using swidden fires as a farming technique. However, recent research has found that swidden fires were practiced historically in Laos and were not, in fact, the source of degradation. Similar research revealed that habitat degradation originated from a population increase after the Vietnam War. The greater volume of people compelled the government to put pressure on farmers for increased agricultural production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robichaud | first1 = W. G. | last2 = Sinclair | first2 = A. R.E. | last3 = Odarkor-Lanquaye | first3 = N. | last4 = Klinkenberg | first4 = B. | year = 2009 | title = Stable Forest Cover Under Increasing Populations of Swidden Cultivators in Central Laos: the Roles of Intrinsic Culture and Extrinsic Wildlife Trade | url = http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss1/art33/ | journal = Ecology and Society | volume = 14 | issue = 1| page = 33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Land managers no longer automatically eliminate the use of swidden fires, but rather the number of swidden fires that are set for government-sponsored agricultural purposes.

The San Francisco Estuary Institute also uses historical ecology to study human impacts on the California landscape to guide environmental management.&lt;ref&gt;Grossinger, R.M., Striplen, C.J., Brewster, E., Beller, E.E., Askevold, R. 2007. "Historical landscape ecology of an urbanized California valley: wetlands and woodlands in the Santa Clara Valley." ''Landscape Ecology''. :103-120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whipple | first1 = A. | last2 = Grossinger | first2 = R.M. | last3 = Davis | first3 = F.W. | year = 2011 | title = Shifting Baselines in a California Oak Savanna: Nineteenth Century Data to Inform Restoration Scenarios | url = | journal = Restoration Ecology | volume = 19 | issue = 101| pages = 88–101 | doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2009.00633.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the wetlands of Elkhorn Slough near [[Monterey, California]], sought to enhance conservation and restoration activities. By using historical data such as maps, charts, and aerial photographs, researchers were able to trace habitat change to built structures that had negatively altered the tidal flow into the estuaries dating from the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyke | first1 = E.V. | last2 = Wasson | first2 = K. | year = 2005 | title = Historical Ecology of a Central California Estuary: 150 Years of Habitat Change | url = http://www.elkhornslough.org | journal = Estuaries | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 173–189 | doi=10.1007/bf02732853}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study further suggested using techniques that "imitate the complex structure of natural tidal wetlands and maintain connectivity with intact wetland habitats as well as with adjoining subtidal and upland habitats."

The '''history of professional wrestling''', as a [[Performing arts|performing art]], started in the early 20th century, with predecessors in [[funfair]] and [[Variety act|variety]] [[High striker|strongman]] and wrestling performances (which often involved [[match fixing]]) in the 19th century.

[[Professional wrestling]] is a popular form of entertainment in [[Australia]], [[North America]], [[Latin America]], [[Europe]] and [[Japan]]. [[History of wrestling#Modern history|Wrestling as a modern sport]] developed in the 19th century out of traditions of [[folk wrestling]], emerging in the form of two styles of regulated competitive sport, "[[Freestyle wrestling|freestyle]]" and "[[Greco-Roman wrestling#History|Greco-Roman]]" wrestling (based on British and continental tradition, respectively), summarized under the term "[[amateur wrestling]]" by the beginning of the [[Olympic sport|modern Olympics]] in 1896. The separation of "[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work (noun)|worked]]", i.e. purely performative, choreographed wrestling ("admitted fakery" or "[[kayfabe]]") from competitive sport begins in the 1920s.

Its popularity declined during World War II, but it was revived in the late 1940s to 1950s, the First Golden Age of professional wrestling in the United States, during which [[Gorgeous George]] gained mainstream popularity. In Mexico and Japan, the 1940s-1950s was also a Golden Age for professional wrestling, with [[El Santo|Santo]] becoming a Mexican folk hero, and [[Rikidōzan]] achieving similar fame in Japan.

There was a marked decline in public interest in the 1970s and early 1980s, but with the advent of cable television in the mid 1980s, there followed a Second Golden Age as the United States experienced a [[1980s professional wrestling boom|professional wrestling boom]], with protagonists such as [[Andre the Giant]], [[Randy Savage]], [[Ric Flair]], and most notably [[Hulk Hogan]]. The nature of professional wrestling was changed dramatically to better fit television, enhancing character traits and storylines. Television has also helped many wrestlers break into mainstream media, becoming influential celebrities and icons of [[popular culture]]. Wrestling's popularity boomed when independent enthusiasts unified and their media outlets grew in number, and became an international phenomenon in the 1980s with the expansion of the [[History of WWE#World Wrestling Federation|World Wrestling Federation]] (now known as World Wrestling Entertainment, shortened to simply [[WWE]]). Throughout the 1990s, professional wrestling achieved highs in both viewership and financial success during a time of fierce competition among competing [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotions]], such as World Wrestling Federation, [[World Championship Wrestling]] and [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]].

Since the mid 2000s, there has been another decline in popularity of professional wrestling; [[Pro Wrestling Noah]]'s ''Power Hour'' and [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]]'s ''World Pro Wrestling'' have been largely relegated to the midnight hours by their broadcasters and WWE's [[List of current WWE programming|television programs]] have seen all-time low ratings. This was paralleled with a renewed interest in competitive combat sports with the rise of [[mixed martial arts]].

== Origin ==
{{further|History of wrestling|All-in professional wrestling}}
A tradition of combining wrestling and showmanship originates in [[July Monarchy|1830s France]], when showmen presented wrestlers under names such as “Edward, the steel eater”, “Gustave d’Avignon, the bone wrecker”, or “Bonnet, the ox of the low Alps” and challenged members of the public to knock them down for 500 [[French franc#French Empire and Restoration|franc]]s.&lt;ref name="FILA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=100246&amp;lang=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011195312/http://fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=100246&amp;lang=en|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 October 2011|title=Roots and history of Olympic wrestling|last=Anon|work=International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles|publisher=FILA|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, French showman, Jean Exbroyat formed the first modern wrestlers’ circus troupe and established a rule not to execute holds below the waist&amp;nbsp;— a style he named "flat hand wrestling". This new style soon spread to the rest of Europe, the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], Italy, Denmark and Russia under the names of [[Greco-Roman wrestling]], Classic wrestling or French wrestling. By the end of the 19th century, this modern "Greco-Roman" wrestling style went on to become the most fashionable sport in Europe, and in 1898 the Frenchman [[Paul Pons|Paul Pons, “the Colossus”]] became the first Professional World Champion.&lt;ref name="FILA"/&gt;

The modern style of professional wrestling, popularized by the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] during the late 19th century, is called the [[catch wrestling|catch-as-catch can]] style. Originally thought of as unorthodox and more lax in style, [[catch wrestling]] differs from Greco-Roman in its allowed grapples; Greco-Roman strictly prohibits grabbing below the waist, while catch wrestling allows holds above and below the waist, including leg grips. Both catch wrestling and Greco-Roman were popular, and fully competitive, amateur and professional sports. But, from the late 19th century onwards, a sub-section of catch wrestling changed slowly into the choreographed sport entertainment now known as "professional wrestling", recognized as much for its theatrical antics and entertainment as wrestling ability.&lt;ref name=historian&gt;{{cite news|first=Matthew |last=Lindaman|title=Wrestling's Hold on the Western World Before the Great War|publisher=Historian, The|date=June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 20th century, wrestling was introduced to the public as part of a [[variety act]] to spice up the limited action involved in the bodybuilder strongman attractions. One of its earliest stars was a Cornish-American ex-miner named [[Jack Carkeek]], who would challenge audience members to last 10 minutes with him. The development of wrestling within the UK brought legitimate [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] grappler [[Georg Hackenschmidt]] to the country, where he would quickly associate himself with promoter and entrepreneur Charles B. Cochran. Cochran took Hackenschmidt under his wing and [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]] him into a match in which Hackenschmidt defeated another top British wrestler, Tom Cannon, for the [[European Greco-Roman Heavyweight Championship|European Greco-Roman title]]. This gave Hackenschmidt a credible claim to the world title, cemented in 1905 with a win over [[American Heavyweight Championship|American Heavyweight Champion]] [[Tom Jenkins (wrestler)|Tom Jenkins]] in the [[United States]]. Hackenschmidt took a series of bookings in [[Manchester]] for a then impressive £150 a week. Noting Hackenschmidt's [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Legit|legitimately]] dominant style of wrestling threatened to kill crowd interest, Cochran persuaded Hackenschmidt to learn showmanship from Cannon and wrestle many of his matches for entertainment rather than sport; this displayed the future elements of [[sports entertainment]]. Numerous big name stars, both beloved [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyfaces]] and hated [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]], came and went during the early inception of wrestling within the UK, with many, like Hackenschmidt, leaving for the US. The resulting loss of big name stars sent the business into decline before the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 halted it completely.

Wrestling's popularity experienced a dramatic tailspin in 1915 to 1920, becoming distanced from the American public because of widespread doubt of its legitimacy and status as a competitive sport. Wrestlers during the time recount it as largely faked by the 1880s. It also waned due to [[Frank Gotch]]'s retirement in 1913, and no new wrestling superstar emerging to captivate the public's eye.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch1/&gt; In response, three professional wrestlers, [[Ed Lewis (wrestler)|Ed Lewis]], [[Billy Sandow]], and [[Toots Mondt]], joined to form their own promotion in the 1920s, modifying their in-ring product to attract fans. The three were referred to as the "[[Gold Dust Trio]]" due to their financial success. Their promotion was the first to use time-limit matches, "flashy" new holds, and signature maneuvers.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg45/&gt; They also popularized [[tag team]] wrestling, introducing new tactics such as distracting the referee, to make the matches more exciting.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg45/&gt; Rather than paying traveling wrestlers to perform on certain dates and combining wrestlers in match-ups when they were available, they decided to keep wrestlers for months and years at a time, allowing long-term angles and feuds to develop.

In the late 1920s, the success of the more [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work (noun)|worked]] aspects of professional wrestling in America, like [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmickry]] and [[Professional wrestling holds|submission holds]], were introduced to British wrestling. Amateur wrestler, [[Atholl Oakley|Sir Atholl Oakley]] got together with fellow grappler Henry Irslinger to launch one of the first promotions to employ the new style of wrestling which was coined "All-in" wrestling. The great demand for wrestling meant there were not enough skilled amateurs to go around, and many promoters switched to more [[Hardcore wrestling|violent styles]], with weapons and chairshots part of the proceedings. Women wrestlers and mud-filled rings also became common place. In the late 1930s, the [[London County Council]] banned professional wrestling, leaving the business in rough shape just before [[World War II]].

== Australia ==
{{main|Professional wrestling in Australia}}
Professional wrestling in Australia first gained distinction in the early 20th century, however there were very few shows promoted. Nonetheless, there were stars such as [[Clarence Weber]], [[Jack Carkeek]], [[Clarence Whistler]], and [[Georg Hackenschmidt]]. As time went on, the sport's popularity began to grow, particularly in the 1930s as people sought to find relief from the [[Great Depression]]. Throughout the 1940s professional wrestling suffered due to [[World War II]] but in the 1950s reached new highs as many stars from overseas were imported and created larger crowds and, in turn, a larger market. Established names such as [[Lou Thesz]], [[Jerry Graham|Dr. Jerry Graham]] and [[Gorgeous George]] toured the country during the decade.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Australia established its only major [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] in [[World Championship Wrestling (Australia)|WCW Australia]]. WCW had a television deal with the [[Nine Network]], the first in Australia to do so and attracted crowds between 2,000 and 9,000 people on a weekly basis. International stars such as [[Alex Iakovidis]], [[Killer Kowalski]], [[Ray Stevens (wrestler)|Ray Stevens]], [[Dominic DeNucci]], [[Mario Milano]], [[Spiros Arion]], [[Karl Gotch]], [[Bruno Sammartino]], [[Gorilla Monsoon]] and local stars Ron Miller and [[Larry O'Dea]] were all involved with the promotion which grew steadily through the 1960s and was a well-known product in the 1970s. However, with the introduction of [[World Series Cricket]], WCW was left with no television deal and was forced to close down in 1978. This sent the Australian market into a large decline. With no access to any product anywhere in the world, the Australian market was almost dead until then [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] became a prominent figure in professional wrestling in the mid-1980s.

Australia has depended on the [[North America]]n product since 1985. Hosting tours in 1985 and 1986 kept a solid viewing in the sport through programs such as ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars of Wrestling]]'' and ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]''. Small local promotions, as well as internationally publicized organizations and tours such as [[World Wrestling All-Stars]] and ''[[Hulkamania: Let The Battle Begin]]'' have tried to take advantage of the popularity of professional wrestling in more recent times, but there has been nothing of note since the demise of World Championship Wrestling in 1978.

== Japan ==
{{main|Puroresu}}
The dominant styles of Japanese professional wrestling were set in place by the two dominant promotions in Japan. [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]], headed by [[Antonio Inoki]], used Inoki's "strong style" approach of wrestling as a simulated combat sport. Wrestlers incorporated kicks and strikes from martial arts disciplines, and a strong emphasis was placed on [[submission wrestling]]. [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]], under the direction of [[Shohei Baba]], used a style referred to as "King's Road". The "King's Road" style was in large part derived from American wrestling, particularly the style of top wrestlers in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]], such as [[Dory Funk, Jr.]], [[Terry Funk]], and [[Harley Race]], all of whom wrestled for Baba in Japan. As such, "King's Road" placed a heavy emphasis on working of holds, brawling, and the storytelling elements of professional wrestling. Throughout the 1990s, three individual styles — [[Shoot wrestling#Shoot-style|shoot style]], [[lucha libre]], and "[[Hardcore wrestling|garbage]]" — were the main divisions of [[Independent circuit|independent promotion]]s, but as a result of the "borderless" trend of the first decade of the 21st century to have interpromotional matches, the line between rules among major-league promotions and independents has for the most part been blurred to standardization.

[[File:Rikidouzan.jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[Rikidōzan]] was a huge star in Japan in the 1950s, and he is commonly credited with bringing professional wrestling to Japan]]
Puroresu done by female wrestlers is called ''joshi puroresu''. Female wrestling in Japan is usually handled by promotions that specialize in ''joshi puroresu'', rather than divisions of otherwise male-dominated promotions as is the case in the United States (the only exception was [[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling|FMW]], a men's promotion which had a small women's division, but even then depended on talent from women's federations to provide competition). However, ''joshi puroresu'' promotions usually have agreements with male puroresu promotions such that they recognize each other's' titles as legitimate, and may share [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Card|card]]s. [[All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling]] was the dominant ''joshi'' organization from the 1970s to the 1990s. AJW's first major star was Mach Fumiake in 1974, followed in 1975 by [[Jackie Sato]] and Maki Ueda, known as The Beauty Pair. The early 1980s saw the fame of [[Jaguar Yokota]] and [[Devil Masami]]. That decade would later see the rise of [[Chigusa Nagayo]] and [[Lioness Asuka]], known as The Crush Gals, who as a tag team achieved a level of unprecedented mainstream success in Japan, unheard of by any female wrestler in the history of professional wrestling all over the world. Their long running feud with [[Kaoru Matsumoto|Dump Matsumoto]] and her Gokuaku Domei (loose translation: "Atrocious Alliance") stable would become extremely popular in Japan during the 1980s, with their televised matches resulting in some of the highest rated in Japanese television as well as the promotion regularly selling out arenas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresu.com/zenjo/|title=All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling|accessdate=|date=August 2001|format=|work=|publisher=Puroresu Dojo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its beginning, Japanese professional wrestling depended on [[television]] to reach a wide audience. [[Rikidōzan]]'s matches in the 1950s, televised by [[Nippon Television|Nippon TV]], often attracted huge crowds to Tokyo giant screens. Eventually [[TV Asahi]] also gained the right to broadcast JWA, but eventually the two major broadcasters agreed to split the talent, centering about Rikidōzan's top two students: NTV for Giant Baba and his group, and Asahi for Antonio Inoki and his group. This arrangement continued after the JWA split into today's major promotions, New Japan and All Japan, led by Inoki and Baba respectively. In 2000, following the [[Pro Wrestling Noah]] split, NTV decided to follow the new venture rather than staying with All Japan. Nowadays, however, mirroring the decline that professional wrestling in the U.S. had in the 1970s and early 1980s; NOAH's ''Power Hour'' and New Japan's ''World Pro Wrestling'' have been largely relegated to the midnight hours by their broadcasters. The advent of [[cable television]] and [[pay-per-view]] also enabled independents such as RINGS to rise. [[WOWOW]], a television network, had a working agreement with Akira Maeda that paid millions to RINGS when he was featured, but eventually was scrapped with Maeda's retirement and the subsequent RINGS collapse.

Since its establishment professional wrestling in Japan has depended on [[Gaijin|foreigners]], particularly North Americans, to get its own stars over. As a result of the introduction of [[lucha libre]] into Japan, major Mexican stars also compete in Japan. The most popular Mexican wrestler to compete in Japan is [[Mil Máscaras]], who is credited with introducing the high-flying moves of lucha libre to Japanese audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=9D757C0F-3048-826A-C4A84E2793E5A01B|title=The Wrestling Gospel According to Mike Mooneyham&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113174457/http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=9D757C0F-3048-826A-C4A84E2793E5A01B|archivedate=2008-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Russian Federation ==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2017}}
The ancestor of modern professional wrestling was the so-called "French wrestling" which was widespread in Europe, including in Russia, the Motherland of a famous wrestler Ivan Poddubny. After the revolution, the interest in "French wrestling" in Russia's missing. Interest to wrestling in Russia back in the 1980s, when the Soviet Union began to arrive with performances by international stars. In the 1990s of the records of the fighting of professional wrestling sometimes shown on cable TV or sold on VHS. In the late 1990s-early 2000s wrestling has become more widespread in the vast national television.

In 2002, the Federation of wrestling have appeared in Russia. In November 2002, in Moscow, the Independent Federation of wrestling held its first championship. Since 2003, IWF hosts a monthly show "danger Zone" since 2005, a special annual show "Wrestleada" - with the participation of foreign wrestlers and the "President's Cup" - with the mass elimination match. Since 2010 - annual show "King of Hardcore". From September to December 2006 abridged version of the show "danger Zone" was broadcast on the television channel 7TV, FROM May 2007 until the end of 2007 on TV "Russian extreme". After that, from May 2008 to mid-2010 and again on the television channel 7TV.

[[File:Rey619.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Rey Mysterio]] hitting the "[[Professional wrestling attacks#Tiger feint kick|619]]" on [[Eddie Guerrero]]]]
In the early 20th century, professional wrestling was mostly a regional phenomenon in Mexico until [[Salvador Lutteroth]] founded the ''[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre]]'' ("Mexican Wrestling Enterprise") in 1933, giving the sport a national foothold for the first time. The promotion company flourished and quickly became the premier spot for wrestlers. As television surfaced as a viable entertainment medium during the 1950s, Lutteroth was then able to broadcast his wrestling across the nation, subsequently yielding a popularity explosion for the sport. Moreover, it was the emergence of television that allowed Lutteroth to promote ''lucha libre'''s first breakout superstar into a national pop-culture phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bongo.net/papers/lucha.htm|title=The History of Lucha Libre&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913065250/http://www.bongo.net/papers/lucha.htm|archivedate=2012-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, ''lucha libre'' would be forever changed when a silver-masked wrestler, known simply as [[El Santo]] ("The Saint"), first stepped into the ring. He made his debut in [[Mexico City]] by winning an eight-man [[Professional wrestling battle royal|battle royal]]. The public became enamored by the mystique and secrecy of Santo's personality and he quickly became the most popular ''luchador'' in Mexico. His wrestling career spanned nearly five decades, during which he became a folk hero and a symbol of justice for the common man through his appearances in [[comic book]]s and [[Lucha film|movies]], while the ''lucha libre'' received an unparalleled degree of mainstream attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/bios/halloffame/santobio.html|title=Professional Wrestling Online Museum - Ring Chronicle Hall of Fame Inductee - El Santo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other legendary ''luchadores'' who helped popularize the ''lucha libre'' include; [[Gory Guerrero]], who is credited with developing moves and holds which are now commonplace in professional wrestling; [[Blue Demon]], a contemporary of Santo and possibly his greatest rival; and [[Mil Máscaras]] ("Man of a Thousand Masks") who is credited with introducing the high flying moves of ''lucha libre'' to audiences around the world. He achieved international fame as one of the first high-flyers, something he was not considered in Mexico where he fell under the mat-power category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lethalwrestling.com/opinions/news_content.php?fileName=730|title=Lucha Legends: Gory Guerrero&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/d/demoazul.htm|title=Blue Demon|website=www.internationalhero.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresudojo.com/articles/sayama-mascaras.html|title=Interview: Mil Mascaras and Satoru Sayama|website=Puroresu Dojo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Luchadores'' are traditionally more agile and perform more [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques|aerial maneuvers]] than professional wrestlers in the United States who, more often, rely on power moves and strikes to subdue their opponents. The difference in styles is due to the independent evolution of the sport in Mexico beginning in the 1930s and the fact that ''luchadores'' in the [[Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|cruiserweight]] division (''peso semicompleto'') are often the most popular wrestlers in Mexican lucha libre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luchalibreusa.com/about.php :: Lucha Libre USA ::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Luchadores'' execute high flying moves characteristic of lucha libre by utilizing the [[wrestling ring]]'s ropes to catapult themselves towards their opponents, using intricate combinations in rapid-fire succession, and applying complex submission holds. ''Lucha libre'' has several weight classes, many catered to smaller agile fighters, who often make their debuts in their mid-teens. This system enables dynamic high-flying ''luchadores'' such as [[Rey Mysterio|Rey Mysterio, Jr.]], [[Juventud Guerrera]], [[Super Crazy]] and [[Místico]], to develop years of experience by their mid-twenties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2006/06/17/1638198.html|title=Lucha Libre 101|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:374844934 cb21e817e0.jpg|thumbnail|left|200px|A ''lucha libre'' tag team match]]
''Lucha libre'' is also known for its [[tag team]] wrestling matches. The teams are often made up of three members, instead of two as is common in the United States. These three man teams participate in what are called '' trios'' matches, for tag team championship belts. Of these three members, one member is designated the captain. A successful fall in a ''trios'' match can be achieved by either pinning the captain of the opposing team or by pinning both of the other members. A referee can also stop the match because of "excess punishment". He can then award the match to the aggressors. Falls often occur simultaneously, which adds to the extremely stylized nature of the action. In addition, a wrestler can opt to roll out of the ring in lieu of tagging a partner or simply be knocked out of the ring, at which point one of his partners may enter. As a result, the tag team formula that United States tag matches tend to follow does not apply to ''lucha libre'' because the race to tag is not a priority. There are also two-man tag matches (''parejas'') as well as "four on four" matches (''atomicos'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stason.org/TULARC/sports/pro-wrestling/8-6-Lucha-Libre-confuses-me-what-are-the-rules.html|title=8.6. Lucha Libre confuses me, what are the rules?|first=Stas Bekman: stas (at)|last=stason.org|website=stason.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wrestling mask|Masks]] (''mascaras'') have been used dating back to the beginnings of ''lucha libre''. Early masks were very simple with basic colors to distinguish the wrestler. In modern ''lucha libre'', masks are colorfully designed to evoke the images of [[animal]]s, [[Deity|gods]], ancient [[hero]]es, and other [[archetype]]s, whose identity the ''luchador'' takes on during a performance. Virtually all wrestlers in Mexico would start their careers wearing masks, but over the span of their careers a large number of them would be unmasked. Sometimes, a wrestler slated for retirement would be unmasked in his final bout or at the beginning of a final tour, signifying loss of identity as that character. Sometimes, losing the mask signifies the end of a gimmick with the wrestler moving on to a new gimmick and mask. The mask is considered "sacred" to a degree, so much so that fully removing an opponent's mask during a match is grounds for disqualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.thedailyaztec.com/media/storage/paper741/news/2002/12/05/Tempo/Who-Was.That.Masked.Man-758787-page2.shtml|title=Who Was That Masked Man? - Tempo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212190019/http://www.thedailyaztec.com/2.7443/1.810061-1.810061|archivedate=2009-02-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During their careers, masked ''luchadores'' would often be seen in public wearing their masks and keeping up the [[kayfabe]] of ''lucha libre'' while other masked wrestlers would interact with the public and press normally. However, they would still go to great lengths to conceal their true identities; in fact, the mask is synonymous with the ''luchador''. ''Luchadors'' whose masks are removed or damaged in the ring would often allow themselves to be pinned in the scripted context of the match's storyline, to preserve their identity. El Santo continued wearing his mask after retirement, revealed his face briefly only in old age, and was buried wearing his silver mask. With the importance placed on masks in ''lucha libre'', losing the mask to an opponent is seen as the ultimate insult and can at times seriously hurt the career of the unmasking wrestler. Putting one's mask on the line against a hated opponent is a tradition in ''lucha libre'' as a means to settle a heated [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] between two or more wrestlers. In these battles, called ''luchas de apuestas'' ("matches with wagers"), the wrestlers "wager" either their mask or their hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2004/09/08/620727.html|title=Viva la lucha libre!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''luchas de apuestas'' match was presented on July 14, 1940 at Arena México. The defending champion Murciélago was so much lighter than his challenger Octavio that he requested a further condition before he would sign the contract: Octavio would have to put his hair on the line. Octavio won the match and Murciélago unmasked, giving birth to a tradition in lucha ''libre''.&lt;ref name="LuchaBook"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lourdes Grobet|author2=Alfonso Morales|author3=Gustavo Fuentes|author4=Jose Manuel Aurrecoechea|title=Lucha Libre: Masked Superstars of Mexican Wrestling|page=115|publisher=Trilce|year=2005|isbn=978-1-933045-05-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting loss of big name stars sent the business into decline before the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 halted it completely.

While [[amateur wrestling]] continued as a legitimate sport, grappling as a promotional business did not catch on until the late 1920s when the success of the more [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work (noun)|worked]] aspects of professional wrestling in America, like [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmickry]] and [[Professional wrestling holds|submission holds]], were introduced to British wrestling. Amateur wrestler, [[Atholl Oakley|Sir Atholl Oakley]] got together with fellow grappler Henry Irslinger to launch one of the first promotions to employ the new style of wrestling which was coined "All-in" wrestling. Under the [[British Wrestling Association]] banner, Oakley's promotion took off with the likes of Tommy Mann, Black Butcher Johnson, [[Jack Pye]], [[Norman Ansell|Norman the Butcher]], College Boy, and Jack Sherry on the roster while Oakley himself would win a series of matches to be crowned the first [[British Heavyweight Championship|British Heavyweight Champion]]. The business was reaching one of its highest points at the time, with the best part of forty regular venues in [[London]] alone. The great demand for wrestling, however, meant there were not enough skilled amateurs to go around, and many promoters switched to more [[Hardcore wrestling|violent styles]], with weapons and chairshots part of the proceedings. Women wrestlers and mud-filled rings also became common place. In the late 1930s, the [[London County Council]] banned professional wrestling, leaving the business in rough shape just before [[World War II]].

It was the promoters themselves who revolutionized the business during this time by using America's [[National Wrestling Alliance]] territory system under the guise of an alliance of promoters attempting to regulate the sport and uphold the committee's ideas to, in fact, create a promotional cartel designed to carve up control of the business between a handful of promoters - which it did in 1952 under the name of [[Professional wrestling in the United Kingdom#Joint Promotions|Joint Promotions]]. By agreeing to rotate talent, and block out rival promoters, Joint Promotions was soon running 40 shows a week, while leaving wrestlers with little bargaining power. One of Joint Promotions' first moves was establishing (and controlling) the championships. At first, this proved a profitable venture, with title matches leading to raise ticket prices. However, perhaps inevitably, attempts to extend this success by bringing in additional titles led to overexposure. While the World and British titles had some credibility (particularly as they were often placed on the more legitimate wrestlers), the addition of European, Empire/Commonwealth, Scottish, Welsh, and area championships got out of hand, and at one point there were conceivably 70 different titleholders to keep track of within Joint Promotions alone.

[[File:Finlay wiki.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Dave Finlay|Dave 'Fit' Finlay]] wrestled for [[ITV Network|ITV]]'s [[World of Sport (UK TV series)|World of Sport]] before finding international success in [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] and [[WWE]]]]
But while titles had some success, it was television that took British wrestling to the next level. The first show aired on ABC and ATV (the weekend franchise holders on [[ITV Network|ITV]]) on 9 November 1955, featuring Francis St Clair Gregory (father of Tony St Clair) versus [[Mike Marino]] and Cliff Beaumont vs Bert Royal live from [[West Ham]] baths. The show was successful, and wrestling became a featured attraction every Saturday afternoon from Autumn to Spring each year. In 1964, it went full-time as part of the ''[[World of Sport (UK TV series)|World of Sport]]'' show. Televised wrestling allowed wrestlers to become household names and allowing personality to get a wrestler [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Over|over]] just as much as size. The exposure of wrestling on television proved the ultimate boost to the live event business as wrestling became part of mainstream culture. By the mid-1960s, Joint Promotions had doubled their live event schedule to somewhere in the region of 4,500 shows a year. Every town of note had a show at least once a month, and at some points more than 30 cities had a weekly date. The success of wrestling on television did however create a better opportunity for the independent groups. The [[Professional wrestling in the United Kingdom|British Wrestling Federation]] name was used for a rival championship, built around Heavyweight champion [[Bert Assirati]] who split away Joint Promotions while still champion and though Joint Promotions vacated the title, Assirati continued to claim it within BWF. BWF would later build itself around a new champion in [[Shirley Crabtree]], a young body builder who won the title after it was vacated by Assirati who retired through injury in 1960. BWF disappeared, together with the young Shirley Crabtree in the early 1960s. The opposition to Joint came from the young Australian promoter, Paul Lincoln.

By 1975, the stranglehold of Joint promotions had almost crumbled, with many of its founding members retiring and the company being bought out several times, leading to the wrestling industry being run by a public company with little experience of the unique business. Finally, promotions were left in the hands of Max Crabtree, the brother of [[Shirley Crabtree|Shirley]], who was headhunted by Joint as the most experienced booker still in the business. Crabtree produced the next boom in British wrestling by creating the legend of "Big Daddy", the alter ego of Shirley, who had been unemployed for the best part of 15 years. Basing a whole cartel around one performer, however, though good for television, did nothing for live events and promotion once again began losing interest. On 28 September 1985, ''World of Sport'' was taken off the air. Wrestling instead got its own show, but the time slot changed from week to week, slowly driving away the regular audience. Far worse for Joint Promotions, however, was that with their contract up, they were forced to share the TV rights as part of a rotation system with All Star Promotions and America's [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF).

Until 2004, British wrestling took a back seat to professional wrestling in [[North America]] as no British television company would broadcast local events. During this time, smaller [[Professional wrestling promotion|wrestling companies]] expanded with evermore growing fan bases. The British style of wrestling is more traditional and [[Professional wrestling holds|technically oriented]] as opposed to the [[Professional wrestling throws|power moves]] displayed by their North American counterparts, as well as the high flying [[lucha libre]] moves performed by their [[Mexico|Mexican]] counterparts. The slogan/philosophy of British wrestling is simply "We wrestle!"; many old style British wrestlers rarely have [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Signature move|signature]] or [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Finisher|finishing moves]] but instead employ a large array of technical holds and [[Pin (amateur wrestling)|pins]] to win matches. In 2005, British television network [[ITV Network|ITV]] tried to make use of the revived popularity of professional wrestling by starting a Saturday night prime time show called ''[[Celebrity Wrestling]]'', featuring celebrities in wrestling style bouts. However, this concept failed due to low ratings.

{{main|History of professional wrestling in the United States}}
Professional wrestling, in the sense of traveling performers paid for mass entertainment in staged matches, began in the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] period in the late 1860s and 1870s.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch1&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|chapter=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, wrestlers were often athletes with amateur wrestling experience who competed at traveling carnivals with [[Carny|carnies]] working as their promoters and bookers. Grand circuses included wrestling exhibitions, quickly enhancing them through colorful costumes and fictional biographies for entertainment, disregarding their competitive nature.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch1/&gt; Wrestling exhibits during the late 19th century were also shown across the United States in countless "athletic shows" (or "at shows"), where experienced wrestlers offered open challenges to the audience.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch1/&gt; It was at these shows, often done for high-stakes gambling purposes, that the nature of the sport changed through the competing interests of three groups of people: the [[impresario]]s, the carnies, and the [[Barnstorm (sports)|barnstormers]].&lt;ref name=hooker-ch1/&gt;

During the late 19th century-early 20th century, wrestling was dominated by [[Martin Burns|Martin "Farmer" Burns]] and his pupil, [[Frank Gotch]]. Burns was renowned as a competitive wrestler, who, despite never weighing more than 160 pounds during his wrestling career, fought over 6,000 wrestlers (at a time when most were competitive contests) and lost fewer than 10 of them.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch3&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|chapter=Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also gained a reputation for training some of the best wrestlers of the era, including Gotch, known as one of America's first sports superstars.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch3/&gt; Gotch, regarded as "peerless" at his peak, was the first to actually claim the world's undisputed heavyweight championship by beating all contenders in North America and Europe. He became the world's champion by beating European wrestling champion [[Georg Hackenschmidt]], both in 1908 and 1911, seen by modern wrestling historians as two of the most significant matches in wrestling history.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch3/&gt; 
Wrestling's popularity experienced a dramatic tailspin in 1915 to 1920, becoming distanced from the American public because of widespread doubt of its legitimacy and status as a competitive sport. Wrestlers during the time recount it as largely faked by the 1880s. It also waned due to Gotch's retirement in 1913, and no new wrestling superstar emerging to captivate the public's eye.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch1/&gt;

Following the retirement of Gotch, professional wrestling (except in the Midwest) was losing popularity fast. Media attention focused on the illegitimacy of wrestling instead of its athleticism, and without a superstar like Gotch, no major personality reached a wide fanbase.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg45&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, three professional wrestlers, [[Ed Lewis (wrestler)|Ed Lewis]], [[Billy Sandow]], and [[Toots Mondt]], joined to form their own promotion in the 1920s, modifying their in-ring product to attract fans. The three were referred to as the "[[Gold Dust Trio]]" due to their financial success. Their promotion was the first to use time-limit matches, "flashy" new holds, and signature maneuvers.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg45/&gt; They also popularized [[tag team]] wrestling, introducing new tactics such as distracting the referee, to make the matches more exciting.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg45/&gt; Rather than paying traveling wrestlers to perform on certain dates and combining wrestlers in match-ups when they were available, they decided to keep wrestlers for months and years at a time, allowing long-term angles and feuds to develop. This was the key to their success; they were able to keep wrestlers from their competition, and were able to have regular wrestling cards.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg45/&gt; Their business succeeded quickly, gaining popularity for its freshness and unique approach to wrestling; a traveling stable of wrestlers.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg46&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trio gained great popularity nationwide during their best years, roughly 1920 to 1925, when they performed in the Eastern territory, acquiring fans from the highly exposed big cities.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg46/&gt; The Trio was dealt a severe blow by [[Stanislaus Zbyszko]], when he beat the rookie [[Wayne Munn]] for their world heavyweight championship, against the original booking.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg47&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Zbyszko quickly [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Drop|dropped]] the title to [[Joe Stecher]], a rival of Ed Lewis, making the situation worse for the Trio.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg47/&gt; Stecher was afraid of losing his championship, refusing to wrestle many contenders as a result. The Trio responded by calling the Munn-Zbysko match illegitimate, and reinstated Munn as champion, but quickly had him drop it to Lewis. This left two champions, Ed Lewis and Joe Stecher, who were regarded as the dominant wrestlers of the period.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg48&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stecher and Lewis did agree to a unification match years later, in 1928, when Stecher gave in and lost the title to Lewis.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg48/&gt;

=== 1887–1950s ===
In 1948, wrestling reached new heights after a loose confederation was formed between independent wrestling companies. This was known as the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA). In the late 1940s to 1950s, the NWA chose [[Lou Thesz]] to unify the various world championships into a single "World Heavyweight" title. Thesz's task was not easy, as some promoters, reluctant to lose face, went so far as to [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] title matches to keep their own champions popular with the fans.

Following the advent of [[television]], professional wrestling matches began to be aired nationally during the 1950s, reaching a larger fanbase than ever before. This was a time of enormous growth for professional wrestling, as rising demand and national expansion made it a much more popular and lucrative form of entertainment than in decades previous. This was called a "Golden Age" for the wrestling industry. It was also a time of great change in both the character and professionalism of wrestlers as a result of the appeal of television. Wrestling fit naturally with television because it was easy to understand, had drama, comedy and colorful characters, and was inexpensive for production.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg101&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sex,lies&gt;{{cite book|last=Assael|first=Shaun|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1948 to 1955, each of the three major television networks broadcast wrestling shows; the largest supporter being the [[DuMont Television Network]].&lt;ref name=sex,lies/&gt; By the late 1950s, professional wrestling had lost its high ratings, and producers, realizing that they had overexposed it, soon dropped most wrestling shows from their lineups.&lt;ref name=sex,lies-pg11&gt;{{cite book|last=Assael|first=Shaun|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining televised wrestling promoters had small, local [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] shows, which network producers placed as late-night fillers rather than signature programming.&lt;ref name=sex,lies-pg13&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|last=Assael|first=Shaun|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoters used localized television as a weapon for eliminating the competition by purchasing airtime from rival territories, effectively putting them out of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NWA Professional Wrestling Territories.png|330px|thumb|The [[List of National Wrestling Alliance territories|NWA territory system]] in North America]]
The NWA was the most dominant wrestling body in the 1950s, and numerous wrestling promotions had been under its leadership. Many promoters, however, viewed it as a crooked tyrant, holding back innovative changes in the sport. It was during this time that several promoters found reason to leave the organization, managing to find niches in the United States. The most prominent of these were the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), which became the most popular wrestling promotion during the 1960s, and the New York-based [[Capitol Wrestling Corporation]] (later named [[World Wide Wrestling Federation]]). As a top wrestler in the 1950s, Verne Gagne formed his own promotion in the NWA in 1957, which soon became the lead promotion with Gagne winning the [[World Heavyweight Championship (Omaha version)|World Heavyweight Championship of Omaha]]. After unsuccessfully lobbying for a title match with the NWA Champion, however, Gagne broke away from the NWA in 1960, renaming his promotion the American Wrestling Association, and making it the dominant organization of the 1960s. Named the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship|AWA World Heavyweight Champion]] soon after, Gagne was the top wrestler, and engaged in many feuds with heel wrestlers, most notably [[Nick Bockwinkel]], and was the AWA's top draw until his retirement in 1981. [[Vince McMahon, Sr.|Vincent J. McMahon]] also withdrew the Capitol Wrestling Corporation from the NWA in 1963, as the NWA Champion Lou Thesz was not a strong draw in the area, and in 1979 shortened Worldwide Wrestling Federation to [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF).

=== 1970s–1980s ===
However, with wrestling's decline in the 1970s, the WWF, without its top draw, [[Bruno Sammartino]] as champion, suffered a blow, and had to rejoin the NWA in 1971. The WWF, however, rebounded after [[André the Giant]] became the company's top superstar when he joined the company in 1973. He was soon the top superstar of all professional wrestling. André became so popular that all NWA territories and the AWA used him, as well. In spite of all this, the NWA as a unit was still on top and gained huge dominance through [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] (GCW), becoming the first nationally broadcast wrestling program on cable television in 1979. It aired on the TBS network.&lt;ref name="Molinaro-Slam"/&gt; By 1981, GCW became the most watched show on cable television.&lt;ref name="Molinaro-Slam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingFeatures/tbs1-can.html|title=End of an era on TBS: Solie, Georgia and 'Black Saturday'|last=Molinaro|first=John|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vince McMahon (Dec 2008).jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[Vince McMahon]], the owner of [[WWE]] (formerly World Wrestling Federation)]]
The 1980s — a time known as the [[1980s professional wrestling boom|1980s wrestling boom]] — represented professional wrestling's greatest period of televised entertainment, reaching widespread popularity among American youth, as well as producing some of its most spectacular characters. In comparison to the declining support of media outlets during the 1960s and 1970s, professional wrestling, notably the emerging World Wrestling Federation (WWF; abridged from WWWF in 1979), received great exposure through its reappearance on network television. The WWF expanded nationally through the acquisition of talent from competing promotions and, because it was the only company to air televised wrestling nationally, became synonymous with the industry, monopolizing the industry and the fanbase. The WWF's owner [[Vince McMahon|Vincent K. McMahon]] revolutionized the sport by coining the term "[[sports entertainment]]" to describe his on-screen product, downplaying the (still claimed) athletic competition in favor of entertaining viewers as well as enhancing its appeal to children. Most notable was the muscular Hulk Hogan, who marked the 1980s with his "all-American" persona. His sheer size, colorful character, and extravagance made his main events into excellent ratings draws. By January 1984, Hogan's legions of fans and his dominant role in the industry was termed "Hulkamania." The "Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection" was a period of cooperation and cross-promotion between the WWF and elements of the music industry. The WWF attracting a degree of mainstream attention with [[Cyndi Lauper]] joining in 1984 and WWF personalities appeared in her music videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/columns/misc/jakehamar04.html|title=Understanding The Mystique Of Captain Lou Albano|accessdate=2007-04-05|author=Hamir, Jake|date=March 2006|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the NWA's renowned and highly successful territory system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aw8hS9psIsI/TX2U4tyXq7I/AAAAAAAAAGo/pYb5ZvDMbOg/s1600/WrestlingTerritories.png|title=WrestlingTerritories.png |work=Freakin' Awesome Network Forums :: Freakin' Awesome Wrestling Forum :: (w)Rest of Wrestling|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was slowly dying, with [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP) became the center of the entire NWA. While the WWF had their major stars at almost all of their shows, the NWA could only manage to have a few of its stars at one show at a time, to promote the product in every territory. After the WWF gained huge dominance with [[WrestleMania]], Crockett responded to the success of the WWF and successfully acquired timeslots on TBS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingFeatures/tbs2-can.html|title=End of an era on TBS: Crockett, Flair and 'The Clashes'|website=slam.canoe.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would continue to buy out NWA promotions between 1985 and 1987 as well. The advent of nationwide television also weakened the system. Wrestlers could no longer travel to a new market and establish a new persona, since fans there already knew who they were. Meanwhile, McMahon took advantage of this phenomenon by purchasing promotions all over the continent, in order to produce a widely popular nationwide television program and make the WWF the only viewing choice.

To counter the NWA's primary [[Card (sports)#Supercard|supercard]], [[Starrcade]], the WWF created its flagship show, [[WrestleMania (1985)|WrestleMania]]. Large television networks also took wrestling into their weekly programming, including ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', premiering on [[NBC]] in 1985, the first wrestling show to air primetime since 1955. [[ESPN]] also began airing professional wrestling for the first time, first airing [[Pro Wrestling USA]] shows-which were created as an alliance between the NWA and AWA in 1984, in an effort to counter the national success the WWF was gaining-, and later AWA shows, after Pro Wrestling USA fell apart by 1986. [[WrestleMania III]], with a reported record attendance of 93,173 people, is widely considered to be the pinnacle of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania3.html|title=Steamboat - Savage rule WrestleMania 3|last=Powell|first=John|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first episode of ''[[WWF The Main Event#The Main Event I|The Main Event]]'' is still today the highest rated professional wrestling television show to date, with a 15.2 rating and 33 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/hall_of_fame/36592/|title=411's Wrestling Hall of Fame Class of 2006: Andre The Giant|publisher=411mania|date=2006-01-18|accessdate=2007-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After WrestleMania III, Crockett also acquired the Universal Wrestling Federation – which broke from the NWA in 1986 – and would also establish a second office in their old Dallas headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/jcp/jcp.htm|title=Jim Crockett Promotions (1985-1989)|website=www.kayfabememories.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; To fight the WWF's control of the industry, JCP took the NWA's pay-per-view names and used its best talent to draw ratings. Crockett was unable to beat McMahon, however, and McMahon took big bites out of Jim Crockett Promotions by successfully airing the 1987 Survivor Series and 1988 Royal Rumble on the same nights as Starrcade 1987 and the 1988 Bunkhouse Stampede ppv cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellaonline.org/articles/art53968.asp|title=The Royal Rumble|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This left him with no viable option other than selling out to media mogul Ted Turner, who renamed the promotion [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and continued to challenge McMahon's monopoly of the industry. Turner promised a more athletic approach to the product, making [[Ric Flair]] the promotion's marquee wrestler and giving young stars big storylines and championship opportunities.

=== 1990s–present ===
[[File:Milan Chris Jericho 2.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Chris Jericho]], the final recognized [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|WCW Champion]] and the first man to unify the title with the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]]]]
During the early 1990s, the growing WWF was being hindered by competing brands and nagging legal troubles. The largest troubles came from WCW, which competed for fans and dominated the industry during the years of 1997 to 1998. The WWF was forced to change itself to overcome its competition, remodeling itself with added bloodshed, violence, and more profane, sexually lewd characters. This new "[[Attitude Era]]" quickly dominated the style and nature of wrestling to become far more teen-oriented than ever before, and made the WWF regain its status as wrestling's top company. The image of WCW changed when [[Eric Bischoff]] was appointed Executive Vice President of WCW in late 1993. He signed former WWF stars and departed from their focus on in-ring action in favor of the WWF's approach. The WWF began to suffer immediately and started building new stars. The Monday Night Wars began in 1995, when WCW started ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]'', a show that ran directly against ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]''. While starting fairly even, the war escalated in 1996 with the formation of the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] stable, the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]]. They helped WCW gain the upper hand when they became the most powerful group in professional wrestling. WCW also came up with more legitimate, edgy storylines and characters over the WWF's cartoon style. Away from the WWF and WCW, a new breed of professional wrestling was beginning. NWA Eastern Championship Wrestling renamed itself [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) and left the NWA. ECW adapted a hardcore style of wrestling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Mick Foley|last=Foley|first=Mick|title=Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2000|isbn=0-06-103101-1|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it exposed the audience to levels of violence rarely seen in wrestling. The unorthodox style of moves, controversial storylines, and intense bloodthirst of ECW made it intensely popular among many wrestling fans in the 18- to 25-year-old demographic. Its intense fanbase, albeit a small constituency, reached near-cultism in the late 1990s and inspired the "hardcore style" in other wrestling promotions, namely WWF and WCW.

In 2001, the WWF (renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2002) became the dominant company in the global professional wrestling industry with the end of its two leading competitors, WCW and ECW. ECW was in dire financial straits earlier that year and Heyman filed for bankruptcy on April 4, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rise &amp; Fall of ECW: Extreme Championship Wrestling|last=Loverro|first=Thom|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2006|isbn=1-4165-1058-3|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; WCW continued to lose more money and finally ended on March 23, 2001 with McMahon buying it out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ringside: A History of Professional Wrestling in America|last=Beekman|first=Scott M.|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-275-98401-X|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WWE also eventually bought out ECW, leaving the company with no real competition in the professional wrestling market.

With a demand remaining for [[List of professional wrestling terms#Rasslin'|Southern-style]], ''[[lucha libre]]'', [[List of professional wrestling terms#Strong Style|strong style]] and [[hardcore wrestling]] that WWE was not fulfilling, new promotions attempted to offer an alternative to cater to this [[niche market]]. The most successful among these were [[Impact Wrestling|Impact Wrestling (initially known as NWA: Total Nonstop Action)]] and [[Ring of Honor]], both started up in 2002. Other independent promotions like [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] and [[Chikara (professional wrestling)|CHIKARA]] also began to gain more exposure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1654">'''Ida Mett''' (born '''Ida Gilman''', 20 July 1901 in [[Smarhoń]], [[Imperial Russia]] &amp;ndash; 27 June 1973 in [[Paris]], [[France]]) was a Belarusian-born [[anarchist]] and author.

Mett was an active participant in the [[Russian anarchist movement]] in [[Moscow]], and was arrested by Soviet authorities for subversive activities and escaped soon thereafter. From Russia, she fled to [[Poland]], later [[Berlin]], and eventually to Paris (1926) where she became active with Dielo Trouda Group and co-edited the ''[[Dielo Truda]]'' magazine.

Mett wrote ''The Kronstadt Commune'', a history of the [[Kronstadt rebellion|rebellion]] at [[Kronstadt]], in 1948. Published by the Spartacus publishing house, it subsequently re-awakened controversy over the events. She also authored ''The Russian Peasant in the Revolution and Post Revolution'' (1968) and contributed to various international periodicals. She died in Paris on 27 June 1973.

'''John Winston Howard''', {{post-nominals|country=AUS|size=100%|sep=,|OM|AC}} (born 26 July 1939) is a former Australian politician who served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia|25th Prime Minister of Australia]] from 1996 to 2007. He is the second-longest serving Australian Prime Minister, behind only Sir [[Robert Menzies]], who was in office for over 18 years. Howard was leader of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] from 1985 to 1989 and from 1995 to 2007.

Howard was born in [[Sydney]] and studied law at the [[University of Sydney]]. He was a commercial lawyer before entering parliament. A former federal president of the [[Young Liberals (Australia)|Young Liberals]], he first stood for office at the [[New South Wales state election, 1968|1968 New South Wales state election]], but lost narrowly. At the [[Australian federal election, 1974|1974 federal election]], Howard was elected to the [[Division of Bennelong]], which he would go on to represent until 2007. He was promoted to cabinet in 1977, and later in the year replaced [[Phillip Lynch]] as [[Treasurer of Australia]], remaining in that position until the defeat of [[Malcolm Fraser]]'s government [[Australian federal election, 1983|in 1983]].

In 1985, Howard was elected leader of the Liberal Party for the first time, thus replacing [[Andrew Peacock]] as [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]]. He led the [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal–National coalition]] to the [[Australian federal election, 1987|1987 federal election]], but lost to [[Bob Hawke]]'s Labor government, and was removed from the leadership in 1989. Remaining a key figure in the party, Howard was re-elected leader in 1995 (replacing [[Alexander Downer]]), and subsequently led the Coalition to victory at the [[Australian federal election, 1996|1996 federal election]].

After defeating [[Paul Keating]]'s Labor government in 1996, the [[Howard Government]] was re-elected at the [[Australian federal election, 1998|1998]], [[Australian federal election, 2001|2001]] and [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 elections]]. Howard's actions as prime minister included [[Gun laws in Australia|new gun laws]] (in response to the [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur massacre]]), the introduction of [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|a nationwide value-added tax]], [[Pacific Solution|immigration reform]], and [[WorkChoices|industrial relations reform]]. Australia also contributed troops to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|War in Afghanistan]] and the [[Iraq War]] under his government, and led the [[International Force for East Timor]]. The Howard government was defeated at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]], with the Labor Party's [[Kevin Rudd]] succeeding him as prime minister. Howard also lost his own seat at the election, becoming only the second prime minister to do so (after [[Stanley Bruce]] in 1929).

==Early life==
[[File:John Howard boy.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Photograph of John Howard as a boy, taken in the 1940s|John Howard as a boy, 1940s]]
John Winston Howard is the fourth son of Mona (''née'' Kell) and [[Lyall Howard]]. His parents were married in 1925. His older brothers were Stanley (1926–2014), Walter (b. 1929), and [[Bob Howard (academic)|Robert]] (b. 1936). Lyall Howard was an admirer of [[Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Garran|2004|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard's ancestors were English, Scottish, and Irish.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Van Onselen, Wayne Errington, John Winston Howard: The Definitive Biography, pp. 2–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard was born and raised in the Sydney suburb of [[Earlwood, New South Wales|Earlwood]], in a [[Methodist]] family.&lt;ref name="Kelly bio"&gt;{{Citation| last = Kelly | first = Paul | title = The Common Man as Prime Minister | work = The Australian | date = 19 May 1999 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother had been an office worker until her marriage. His father and his paternal grandfather, Walter Howard, were both veterans of the [[First Australian Imperial Force|First AIF]] in World War I. They also ran two [[Dulwich Hill, New South Wales|Dulwich Hill]] petrol stations where Howard worked as a boy.&lt;ref name="SMH_Petrol"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/06/18/1150569210879.html?page=fullpage | title=Tin soldered for the King in Howard's home | work=Sydney Morning Herald | date=19 June 2006 | accessdate=29 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lyall Howard died in 1955 when John was sixteen, leaving his mother to take care of John&lt;ref&gt;Birnbauer, Bill, "Rise Of A Common Man", ''The Age'', 4 March 1996&lt;/ref&gt; (or "Jack" as he was also known).&lt;ref name="SMH_Canterbury"&gt;{{Citation| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/09/17/1095394004427.html | title=Canterbury tales | work=Sydney Morning Herald | date=18 September 2004 | accessdate=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard suffered a hearing impairment in his youth, leaving him with a slight [[speech disorder|speech impediment]],&lt;ref name="transcript-lab_opening"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/media/pressrel/1ET06/upload_binary/1et061.pdf;fileType%3Dapplication%2Fpdf | title=Transcript of the Prime Minister the Hon. John Howard MP, opening of the child deafness research laboratories at The Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, East Melbourne | publisher=Parlinfo | date=16 February 2000 | accessdate=8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he continues to wear a hearing aid. It also influenced him in subtle ways, limiting his early academic performance; encouraging a reliance on an excellent memory; and in his mind ruling out becoming a [[barrister]] as a likely career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Onselen|Errington|2007|pp=21, 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard attended Earlwood Primary School and [[Canterbury Boys' High School]].&lt;ref name="SMH_Canterbury"/&gt; He won a citizenship prize in his final year at Earlwood (presented by local politician [[Eric Willis]]), and subsequently represented his secondary school at debating as well as [[cricket]] and [[rugby union]].&lt;ref name="The Sports Factor"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/sportsfactor/stories/2001/401143.htm| title=Beazley and Howard- Politics and Sport | publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date=26 October 2001 | accessdate=13 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cricket remained a lifelong hobby.&lt;ref name="Kelly bio"/&gt; In his final year at school he took part in a radio show hosted by [[Jack Davey]], ''Give It a Go'', broadcast on the commercial radio station, [[2GB]].&lt;ref name="young_howard_recording"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://australianpolitics.com/2002/06/09/john-howard-jack-davey-quiz.html|title=Recording Of John Howard At 16 On Jack Davey Quiz Show|publisher=australianpolitics.com |date=9 June 2002 |accessdate=19 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After gaining his [[Leaving Certificate]], he studied law at the [[University of Sydney]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree in 1961.&lt;ref name="SMH_Canterbury"/&gt; Howard began working for the firm of Stephen Jaques and Stephen as a junior solicitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Onselen|Errington|2007|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, he took a trip around the world, visiting Britain, Europe, Israel, India, and Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Onselen|Errington|2007|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to Sydney in 1965, he began working for [[Clayton Utz]], but "lacked the university grades and the social connections to be on track for a partnership". He subsequently moved to a smaller firm, which became Truman, Nelson and Howard after he was made a partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Onselen|Errington|2007|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard married fellow Liberal Party member [[Janette Howard|Janette Parker]] in 1971, with whom he had three children: Melanie (1974), Tim (1977) and Richard (1980).&lt;ref name="NAA_JanetteHoward"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/meetpm.asp?pmId=25 | title=Australia's Prime Ministers : John Howard | publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]] | accessdate=27 November 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070830111647/http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/meetpm.asp?pmId=25 |archivedate = 30 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career, 1957–77==
Howard joined the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] in 1957. He was a member of the party's New South Wales state executive and served as federal president of the [[Young Liberals (Australia)|Young Liberals]] (the party youth organisation) from 1962 to 1964.&lt;ref name="young_libs"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.younglibs.org.au/lifemembers.php | title=Young Liberals Life Members &amp; Past Presidents | publisher=[[Young Liberals (Australia)|Young Liberals]] |year=2006 | accessdate=8 July 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051221230853/http://www.younglibs.org.au/lifemembers.php |archivedate = 21 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard supported [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Australia's involvement]] in the [[Vietnam War]], although has since said there were "aspects of it that could have been handled and explained differently".&lt;ref name=4corners&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2004/s1212701.htm | title=John Howard Interview– 1996 | work=[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]] | date=19 February 1996 | accessdate=26 December 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511192636/http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2004/s1212701.htm | archive-date=11 May 2011 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Australian federal election, 1963|1963 federal election]], Howard acted as campaign manager for [[Tom Hughes (Australian politician)|Tom Hughes]] in his local seat of [[Division of Parkes (1901-69)|Parkes]]. Hughes went on to defeat the 20-year Labor incumbent, [[Les Haylen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/howard/before-office.aspx|title=John Howard - Before office|last=|first=|date=|website=National Archives of Australia|access-date=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1964, Howard travelled to [[London]] to work and travel for a period. He volunteered for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the electorate of [[Holborn and St Pancras South (UK Parliament constituency)|Holborn and St Pancras South]] at the [[1964 general election (UK)|1964 UK general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lazarus Rising|last=Howard|first=John|publisher=Harper Collins|year=2010|isbn=9780732289959|location=|pages=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, with the support of party power brokers [[John Carrick (Australian politician)|John Carrick]] and [[Eric Willis]], Howard was endorsed as candidate for the marginal suburban state seat of [[Electoral district of Drummoyne|Drummoyne]], held by Labor's [[Reg Coady]]. Howard's mother sold the family home in [[Earlwood, New South Wales|Earlwood]] and rented a house with him at [[Five Dock, New South Wales|Five Dock]], a suburb within the electorate. At [[New South Wales state election, 1968|the election in February 1968]], in which the incumbent state Liberal government was returned to office, Howard narrowly lost to Coady, despite campaigning vigorously.&lt;ref name="Drummoyne_1968"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1968/Drummoyne.htm |title=Drummoyne – 1968 |publisher=[[Parliament of New South Wales]] |date=25 July 2007 |accessdate=25 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929150140/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1968/Drummoyne.htm |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard and his mother subsequently returned to Earlwood, moving to a house on the same street where he grew up.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

At the [[Australian federal election, 1974|1974 federal election]], Howard successfully contested the [[Division of Bennelong]], located in suburban Sydney. The election saw the return of the [[Gough Whitlam]]-led Labor government. Howard supported [[Malcolm Fraser]] for the leadership of the Liberal Party against [[Billy Snedden]] following the 1974 election.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1994), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; When Fraser won office at the [[Australian federal election, 1975|1975 federal election]], Howard was appointed [[Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs]], a position in which he served until 1977.&lt;ref name="NMA"/&gt; At this stage, he followed the [[protectionist]] and pro-regulation stance of Fraser and the Liberal Party.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1994), pp. 101–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal Treasurer (1977–83)==

In December 1977, aged 38, Howard was appointed [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] in place of [[Phillip Lynch]].&lt;ref name="NMA"/&gt; He was the youngest Treasurer since [[Chris Watson]] in 1904. Fraser said in his memoirs that he appointed him despite his limited experience because "he was bright and he got across a brief well, and he was a good manager".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Malcolm Fraser]] and [[Margaret Simons]]|year=2011|title=Malcolm Fraser: The Political Memoirs|publisher=The Miegunyah Press|page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During his five years in the position, Howard became an adherent of [[market economics|free-market economics]],&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1994), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; which was challenging economic orthodoxies in place for most of the century.&lt;ref name="Kelly 1994, pp. 50-53"&gt;Kelly (1994), pp. 50–53.&lt;/ref&gt; He came to favour tax reform including broad-based taxation (later the [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|GST]]), a freer industrial system including the dismantling of the centralised wage-fixing system, the abolition of compulsory [[trade unionism]], privatisation and deregulation.&lt;ref name="Kelly bio"/&gt;

In 1978, the Fraser government instigated the Campbell Committee to investigate financial system reforms.&lt;ref name="Bell_21"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bell|2004|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard supported the Campbell report, but adopted an incremental approach with Cabinet, as there was wide opposition to deregulation within the government and the treasury.&lt;ref name="Bell_21"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kelly|1994|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of reform began before the committee reported 2½ years later, with the introduction of the tender system for the sale of Treasury notes in 1979, and Treasury bonds in 1982. [[Ian Macfarlane (economist)|Ian Macfarlane]] described these reforms as "second only in importance to the float of the Australian dollar in 1983."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/boyerlectures/stories/2006/1769925.htm Boyer Lecture 3: Reform and Deregulation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927135029/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/boyerlectures/stories/2006/1769925.htm |date=27 September 2011 }}''26 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Howard proposed a broad-based indirect tax with compensatory cuts in personal rates; however, cabinet rejected it citing both inflationary and political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1994), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; After the free-marketeers or "drys" of the Liberals challenged the protectionist policies of [[Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations (Australia)|Minister for Industry and Commerce]] [[Phillip Lynch]], they shifted their loyalties to Howard. Following an unsuccessful leadership challenge by [[Andrew Peacock]] to unseat Fraser as prime minister, Howard was elected deputy leader of the Liberal Party in April 1982. His election depended largely on the support of the "drys", and he became the party's champion of the growing free-market lobby.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1994), pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic crises of the early 1980s brought Howard into conflict with the economically conservative Fraser. As the economy headed towards the worst recession since the 1930s, [[Keynesian]] Fraser pushed an expansionary fiscal position much to Howard's and Treasury's horror. With his authority as treasurer being flouted, Howard considered resigning in July 1982, but, after discussions with his wife and senior advisor [[John Hewson]], he decided to "tough it out".&lt;ref name="Kelly 1994, pp. 50-53"/&gt; The 1982 wages explosion—wages rose 16 per cent across the country—resulted in [[stagflation]]; unemployment touched double-digits and inflation peaked at 12.5% (official interest rates peaked at 21%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title =F01 Interest rates and yields&amp;nbsp;– money market | publisher =[[Reserve Bank of Australia]] | url =http://www.rba.gov.au/Statistics/Bulletin/F01hist.xls | format =Excel file |accessdate=29 August 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070729185829/http://www.rba.gov.au/Statistics/Bulletin/F01hist.xls |archivedate = 29 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fraser Government with Howard as Treasurer lost the [[Australian federal election, 1983|1983 election]] to the Labor Party led by [[Bob Hawke]]. Over the course of the 1980s, the Liberal party came to accept the free-market policies that Fraser had resisted and Howard had espoused. Policies included low protection, decentralisation of wage fixation, financial deregulation, a broadly based indirect tax, and the rejection of counter-cyclical fiscal policy.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1994), p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition, 1983–96==
Following the defeat of the Fraser government and Fraser's subsequent resignation from parliament, Howard contested the Liberal leadership against [[Andrew Peacock]], [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership election, 1983|losing 36–20]]. However, he was re-elected as deputy leader. The Liberal Party were again defeated by Labor at the early [[Australian federal election, 1984|1984 election]]. In 1985, as Labor's position in opinion polls improved, Peacock's popularity sank and Howard's profile rose. Leadership speculation persisted, and Peacock said he would no longer accept Howard as deputy unless he offered assurances that he would not challenge for the leadership. Following Howard's refusal to offer such an assurance, Peacock sought, in September 1985, to replace him with [[John Moore (Australian politician)|John Moore]] as Deputy Leader.&lt;ref name="Barclay 264"&gt;{{Citation |last= Barclay |first= Glen |date=August 1986 |title= Australian Political Chronicle: July–December 1985 |journal= Australian Journal of Politics and History |volume= 32 |issue= 2 |page= 264 |issn=0004-9522}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party room re-elected Howard as deputy on 5 September, 38 votes to 31, which Peacock treated as a [[vote of no confidence]] in his leadership. He subsequently called [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill, 1985|a leadership ballot]], which he chose not to contest. Howard defeated [[Jim Carlton]] by 57 votes to six, thus becoming Leader of the Opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=George |url=http://poliquant.com/major-party-leadership-ballots-since-1966/ |title=poliquant.com |publisher=poliquant.com |date= |accessdate=17 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107042840/http://poliquant.com/major-party-leadership-ballots-since-1966/ |archivedate=7 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1994), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Leader of the Opposition (1985–89)===

In addition to the Howard–Peacock rivalry, Queensland National Party criticism of the federal Liberal and National leadership &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |doi= 10.1111/j.1467-8497.1987.tb00153.x |date=December 1987 |title= Australian Political Chronicle: January–June 1987 |journal= Australian Journal of Politics and History |volume= 33 |issue= 3 |pages= 279–285 |issn=0004-9522}}&lt;/ref&gt; culminated in longtime Queensland Premier [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] making a bid to become Prime Minister himself—the "[[Joh for Canberra]]" campaign. Keating campaigned against Howard's proposed tax changes forcing Howard to admit a [[double counting (accounting)|double-counting]] in the proposal,&lt;ref name="PKelly_EndOfCertainty1994"&gt;{{Citation|last=Kelly|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Kelly (journalist)|title=The End of Certainty: Power, Politics, and Business in Australia|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EKXBgmYeO2QC&amp;dq|accessdate=5 October 2007|publisher=[[Allen &amp; Unwin]]

|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; and emphasising to the electorate that the package would mean at that stage undisclosed cuts to government services.  Howard was not helped when the federal Nationals broke off the Coalition agreement in support of the "Joh for Canberra" push.  Bjelke-Petersen abandoned his bid for Prime Minister a month before the election.  However, the damage had already been done.  The end of the Coalition agreement led to a large number of three-cornered contests.  Additionally, a number of swing voters outside Queensland were alarmed at the prospect of Bjelke-Petersen holding the balance of power, and voted for Labor in order to ensure that the Liberals and Nationals would be defeated.  As a result, the Hawke Government was handily reelected, winning the most seats that Labor had ever won in an election.

====Social agenda====
In his social agenda, Howard promoted the traditional family and was antipathetic to the promotion of [[multiculturalism]] at the expense of a shared Australian identity.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1994), pp. 419.&lt;/ref&gt; The controversial immigration policy, ''[[One Australia policy|One Australia]]'', outlined a vision of "one nation and one future" and opposed multiculturalism.&lt;ref name="markus85"/&gt; Howard publicly suggested that to support "social cohesion" the rate of Asian immigration be "slowed down a little".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Onselen|Errington|2007|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comments divided opinion within the Coalition, and undermined Howard's standing amongst Liberal party figures including federal and state Ministers, intellectual opinion makers, business leaders, and within the Asia Pacific. Three Liberal MPs [[Crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] and two abstained in response to a motion put forward by Prime Minister Hawke to affirm that race or ethnicity would not be used as immigrant selection criteria. Many Liberals later nominated the issue as instrumental in Howard subsequently losing the leadership in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1994), pp. 427–428.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1995 newspaper article (and in 2002 as Prime Minister), Howard recanted his 1988 remarks on curbing Asian immigration.&lt;ref name="Aus_spice"&gt;{{Citation

In line with "One Australia's" rejection of Aboriginal land rights, Howard said the idea of an Aboriginal treaty was ''"repugnant to the ideals of One Australia"''&lt;ref name="markus85"/&gt; and commented ''"I don't think it is wrong, racist, immoral or anything, for a country to say 'we will decide what the cultural identity and the cultural destiny of this country will be and nobody else."''&lt;ref name="SMH_cricket"&gt;{{Citation | title = When talk of racism is just not cricket |work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date = 16 December 2005 | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2005/12/15/1134500961607.html |accessdate=19 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss of the leadership===
As the [[Early 1990s recession|country's economic position worsened]] in 1989, public opinion moved away from Labor, however there was no firm opinion poll lead for Howard or the Coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1994), p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt; In February, Liberal Party president and prominent businessman, [[John Elliott (businessman)|John Elliott]], said confidentially to Andrew Peacock that he would support him in a leadership challenge against Howard,&lt;ref name="PKelly_EndOfCertainty1994"/&gt; and in May a surprise leadership coup was launched, ousting Howard as Liberal leader. When asked that day whether he could become Liberal leader again, Howard likened it to ''"Lazarus with a triple bypass"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/02/28/1077677011993.html |title=Thoughts of a bypassed Lazarus|work=The Age | location=Melbourne|date=29 February 2004|accessdate=25 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the Liberal Party leadership to Peacock deeply affected Howard, who admitted he would occasionally drink too much.&lt;ref name="news_drunk"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22129486-2,00.html |title=Howard: 'I was drunk at work' |work=[[The Courier-Mail]] |date=25 July 2007 |accessdate=25 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903193447/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C23599%2C22129486-2%2C00.html |archivedate= 3 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Declining Peacock's offer of Shadow Education, Howard went to the backbench and a new period of party disunity ensued. Howard served as Shadow Minister for Industry, Technology and Communications, Shadow Minister Assisting the Leader on the Public Service, Chairman of the Manpower and Labour Market Reform Group, Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations and Manager of Opposition Business in the House.

Following the Coalition's [[Australian federal election, 1990|1990 election]] loss,  Howard considered challenging Peacock for the leadership, but didn't have enough support for a bid.  Ultimately, Peacock resigned and was replaced with former Howard staffer [[John Hewson]] who defeated [[Peter Reith]]. Peacock supported Hewson with generational change which took Howard's name out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EuqFg5dUmgQC&amp;pg=PA45 |title=The March of Patriots: The Struggle for Modern Australia |author=Kelly, Paul |authorlink=Paul Kelly (journalist) |page=45 |chapter=Big Bang Liberalism |publisher=Melbourne Univ. Publishing |year=2011 |location=Melbourne, Australia |isbn=0-522-85738-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard was a supporter of Hewson's economic program, with a [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST) as its centrepiece. After Hewson lost the "unloseable" [[Australian federal election, 1993|1993 election]] to [[Paul Keating]], Howard unsuccessfully challenged Hewson for the leadership. In 1994, he was again passed over for the leadership, which went to [[Alexander Downer]].

===Leader of the Opposition (1995–96)===
In January 1995, leaked internal Liberal Party polling showed that with gaffe-prone Downer as leader, the Coalition had slim chance of holding its marginal seats in the next election, let alone of winning government. Media speculation of a leadership spill ended when, on 26 January 1995, Downer resigned as Liberal Leader and Howard was elected unopposed to replace him.&lt;ref name="Ward 1995"/&gt; The [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] subsequently opened a large lead over Labor in most opinion polls, and Howard overtook [[Paul Keating]] as preferred prime minister. Hoping to avoid a repeat of 1993, Howard revised his earlier statements against [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] and Asian immigration, describing Australia as "a unique intersection between Europe, North America and Asia".&lt;ref name=4corners/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aus_spice"/&gt; This allowed Howard to campaign on a "small-target" strategy. He focused on the economy and memory of the early 1990s recession, and on the longevity of the Labor government, which in 1996 had been in power for 13 years.

===1996 election===

====First term, 1996–98====
By the time the writs were issued for the [[Australian federal election, 1996|1996 election]], the Coalition had been well ahead of Labor in opinion polls for over a year. The consensus of most opinion polls was that Howard would be the next prime minister.

With the support of many traditionally Labor voters—dubbed "[[Aussie battler|Howard battlers]]"—Howard and the Liberal-National Coalition swept to power on the back of a 29-seat swing. This was the second-worst defeat of an incumbent government since Federation. The Coalition only picked up a five percent swing, which is usually not enough to cause a change of government.  However, the Coalition took 13 seats off Labor in New South Wales, and won all but two seats in Queensland.  The Liberals actually won a majority in their own right with 75 seats, the most that the party had ever won.  It was only the third time (the others being 1975 and 1977) that the main non-Labor party has been even theoretically able to govern alone since the Coalition's formation.  Nevertheless, Howard kept the Nationals in his government.

Howard entered office with a 45-seat majority—the second-biggest majority in Australian history, only behind Fraser's 55-seat majority in 1975.  At the age of 56, he was sworn in as prime minister on 11 March 1996, ending a record 13 years of Coalition opposition.&lt;ref name="NMA"&gt;{{Citation| url=http://www.nma.gov.au/primeministers/john_howard | title=Prime Ministers of Australia: John Howard | publisher=[[National Museum of Australia]] | date=1 August 2007 | accessdate=14 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard departed from tradition and made his primary residence [[Kirribilli House]] in Sydney rather than [[The Lodge (Australia)|The Lodge]] in Canberra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Milne |first=Glenn |url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,21878816-5001021,00.html |title=PM hires out Kirribilli House |publisher=News.com.au |date=10 June 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the term Howard had championed significant new restrictions on gun ownership following the [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur massacre]] in which 35 people had been shot dead. Achieving agreement in the face of immense opposition from within the Coalition and some State governments, was credited with significantly elevating Howard's stature as prime minister despite a backlash from core Coalition rural constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = | title = The Howard Years (episode 4) | medium = TV Series | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | location = Australia |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kelly | first = Paul | title = A Year of Governing Cautiously | newspaper = The Weekend Australian | date = 1–2 May 1997| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nma.gov.au/primeministers/john_howard Prime Ministers of Australia: John Howard] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326111912/http://www.nma.gov.au/primeministers/john_howard |date=26 March 2016 }}, National Museum of Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8497.1995.tb01274.x | last = Ward | first = Ian | authorlink = Ian Ward (professor) | title = Australian Political Chronicle: January–June 1995 | journal = Australian Journal of Politics and History | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 444–448 |date=December 1995 | issn = 0004-9522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard's initial silence on the views of [[Pauline Hanson]]—a disendorsed Liberal Party candidate and later independent MP from the Brisbane area—was criticised in the press as an endorsement of her views.&lt;ref name=howardyearschronology&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/howardyears/chronology/assets/chronology.pdf The Howard Years&amp;nbsp;– Chronology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225161808/http://www.abc.net.au/news/howardyears/chronology/assets/chronology.pdf |date=25 February 2009 }}, [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]&lt;/ref&gt; When Hanson had made derogatory statements about minorities, Howard not only canceled her Liberal endorsement, but declared she would not be allowed to sit as a Liberal if elected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-20/liberal-party-dump-charlton-candidate-kevin-baker-over-lewd-web/4900436 Liberal candidate Kevin Baker quits race for Charlton over lewd website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031180105/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-20/liberal-party-dump-charlton-candidate-kevin-baker-over-lewd-web/4900436 |date=31 October 2016 }}. ABC News, 20 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Howard repudiated Hanson's views seven months after her maiden speech.&lt;ref name=howardyearschronology /&gt;

Following the [[Wik Peoples v Queensland|Wik Decision]] of the High Court in 1996, the Howard government moved swiftly to legislate limitations on its possible implications through the so-called [[Native Title Amendment Act 1998|Ten-Point Plan]].
[[File:HowardCohen97.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of Australian Prime Minister John Howard escorted by US Secretary of Defense William Cohen through an armed forces honor cordon into the Pentagon, June 1997|John Howard and US Secretary of Defense [[William Cohen]] in 1997]]
From 1997, Howard spearheaded the Coalition push to introduce a [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST) at the 1998 election. Before winning the Prime Ministership, Howard said that he considered the Coalition's defeat in 1993 to be a rejection of the GST, and as a result it would "never ever" be part of Coalition policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2006/s1582253.htm |title=A look back at Howard's ten years |publisher=ABC |location=Australia  |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A long-held conviction of Howard's, his tax reform package was credited with "breaking the circuit" of party morale—boosting his confidence and direction, which had appeared to wane early in the Government's second term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Onselen|Errington|2007|pp=272–273}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1998 election was dubbed a "referendum on the GST", and the tax changes—including the GST—were implemented in the government's second term after amendments to the legislation were negotiated with the [[Australian Democrats]] to ensure its passage through the Senate.

Through much of its first term, opinion polling was disappointing for the government.&lt;ref name="The Howard Years episode 1"&gt;{{cite video

 | last = Kelly | first = Paul | title = Howard's Big Picture and Big Gamble | work = The Australian | date = 23 September 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of Pauline Hanson, and the new restrictions on gun ownership drew many traditionally Coalition voters away from the Howard government. Also unpopular with voters were large spending cuts aimed at eliminating the budget deficit (and Howard's distinction between "core" and "non-core" election promises when cutting spending commitments), [[Workplace Relations Act 1996|industrial changes]] and the [[1998 Australian Waterfront Dispute|1998 waterfront dispute]], the partial sale of government telecommunications company [[Telstra]], and the Government's commitment to a GST.

Howard called a [[Australian federal election, 1998|snap election for October 1998]], three months sooner than required. The Coalition actually lost the national two-party preferred vote to Labor, suffering a 14-seat swing. However, the uneven nature of the swing allowed Howard to win a second term in government, with a considerably reduced majority (from 45 seats to 12). Howard himself finished just short of a majority on the first count in his own seat, and was only assured of reelection on the ninth count. He ultimately finished with a fairly comfortable 56 percent of the two-party preferred vote.

===Second term, 1998–2001===
In 1998, Howard convened a [[Australian Constitutional Convention 1998|Constitutional Convention]] which decided in principle that Australia should [[Republicanism in Australia|become a Republic]]. At the convention Howard confirmed himself as a monarchist, and said that of the Republican options, he preferred the minimalist model. Howard outlined his support for retaining the [[Monarchy in Australia|Australian constitutional monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/republic98/hansard/hans1.html |archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/nph-arch/1999/Z1999-Dec-10/http://www.theage.com.au/republic98/hansard/hans1.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 December 1999 |title=Pandora Archive |publisher=Pandora.nla.gov.au |date=23 August 2006 |accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite opinion polls suggesting Australians favoured a republic, a 1999 referendum rejected the model chosen by the convention.

Although new [[Indonesian President]] [[B.J. Habibie]] had some months earlier agreed to grant special autonomy to [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Indonesian-occupied]] [[East Timor]], his subsequent snap decision for a referendum on the territory's independence triggered a Howard and Downer orchestrated shift in Australian policy. In September 1999, Howard organised an Australian-led international peace-keeping force to East Timor ([[INTERFET]]), after [[pro-Indonesia militia]] launched a violent "scorched-earth" campaign in retaliation to the referendum's overwhelming vote in favour of independence. The successful mission was widely supported by Australian voters, but the government was criticised{{who|date=November 2010}} for "foreign policy failure" following the violence and collapse of diplomatic relations with Indonesia. By Howard's fourth term, relations with Indonesia had recovered to include counter-terrorism cooperation and Australia's $1bn [[Boxing Day Tsunami]] relief efforts, and were assisted by good relations between Howard and [[Indonesian President]] [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=AAP |url=http://en.epochtimes.com/news/6-3-6/38988.html |title=The Epoch Times &amp;#124; Indonesia-Australian Relationship Best Ever |publisher=En.epochtimes.com |date=6 March 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114112411/http://en.epochtimes.com/news/6-3-6/38988.html |archivedate=14 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.kbri-canberra.org.au/speeches/2005/050301e.htm |title='Indonesia&amp;nbsp;– Australian Relations: East Timor, Bali Bombing, Tsunami and Beyond' by Ambassador Imron Cotan |publisher=Kbri-canberra.org.au |accessdate=25 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107014127/http://www.kbri-canberra.org.au/speeches/2005/050301e.htm |archivedate=7 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his prime-ministership, Howard was resolute in his refusal to provide a parliamentary "apology" to [[Indigenous Australians]] as recommended by the 1997 "[[Bringing Them Home]]" Report.  Howard made a personal apology before the release of the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |title=The History of Apologies Down Under [Thinking Faith&amp;nbsp;– the online journal of the British Jesuits&amp;#93; |publisher=Thinkingfaith.org |accessdate=25 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202000730/http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |archivedate= 2 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Howard negotiated a "[[Motion of Reconciliation]]" with Aboriginal Senator [[Aden Ridgeway]]. Eschewing use of the word "sorry", the motion recognised mistreatment of Aborigines as the "most blemished chapter" in Australia's history; offered "deep and sincere ''regret''" for past injustices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=(Id:media/pressrel/23e06);rec=0; |title=ParlInfo&amp;nbsp;– Title Details |publisher=Parlinfo.aph.gov.au |accessdate=25 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019054901/http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p%3Bquery%3D%28Id%3Amedia/pressrel/23e06%29%3Brec%3D0%3B |archivedate=19 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his 2007 loss of the prime ministership, Howard was the only living former prime minister who declined to attend the February 2008 apology made by [[Kevin Rudd]] with bi-partisan support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Throughout 2002 and 2003 Howard had increased his opinion poll lead over Labor Party leader, [[Simon Crean]]. In December 2003, Crean resigned after losing party support and [[Mark Latham]] was elected leader. Howard called [[Australian federal election, 2004|an election for 9 October 2004]].

It also resulted the first, albeit slim, government majority in the Senate since 1981.

In 2006, with the government now controlling both houses of parliament for the first time since the Fraser era, industrial relations changes were enacted. Named "[[WorkChoices]]" and championed by Howard, they were intended to fundamentally change the employer-employee relationship. Opposed by a broad trade union campaign and antipathy within the electorate, WorkChoices was subsequently seen as a major factor in the government's 2007 election loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

In May 2006, the degradation of Aboriginal communities, and the frequent child sexual abuses that occurred within these, was brought to the forefront of the public's mind. In response to this, a report into child sexual abuse in the Northern Territory was commissioned. Following this, there was an intervention into these Northern Territory communities. This received widespread criticism, with some holding that it was no more than another attempt to control these communities. Howard was not exempt from this criticism on the grounds of racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=  Rhetoric, Aboriginal Australians and the Northern Territory Intervention: A Socio-legal Investigation into Pre-legislative Argumentation| doi=10.5204/ijcjsd.v5i1.285 | volume=5 | journal=International Journal for Crime, Justice and Social Democracy| page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Australian federal election, 2007}}
Leading up to the [[Australian federal election, 2007|24 November election]], the Coalition had been behind Labor in the polls for almost two years, a margin that grew even larger after Rudd became opposition leader. In the election, Howard and his government were defeated, suffering a 23-seat swing to Labor, which was almost as large as the 29-seat swing that propelled him to power in 1996. Howard lost his seat of Bennelong to former journalist [[Maxine McKew]] by 44,685 votes (51.4 percent) to Howard's 42,251 (48.6 percent).  The latest redistribution placed Bennelong right on the edge of seats Labor needed to win in order to make Rudd Prime Minister.  The ABC actually listed Bennelong as a Labor gain on election night.&lt;ref name='ABC2007ElectionBennelong'&gt;{{Citation

Media analysis of The Australian Election Study, a postal survey of 1,873 voters during the 2007 poll, found that although respondents respected Howard and thought he had won the 6-week election campaign, Howard was considered "at odds with public opinion on cut-through issues", his opponent had achieved the highest "likeability" rating in the survey's 20-year history, and a majority had decided their voting intention before the election campaign.&lt;ref name='AUS20080524_AustElectionSurvey'&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.smh.com.au/text/articles/2008/05/23/1211183103011.html |title=What made battlers turn the tide |author=Mark Davis |work=Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax |date=24 May 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Justus Scaliger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|æ|l|ɪ|dʒ|ər}}; 5 August 1540 – 21 January 1609) was a [[France|French]] religious leader and scholar, known for expanding the notion of classical history from [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] history to include [[Persian Empire|Persian]], [[Babylonia]]n, [[Jewish history|Jewish]] and [[History of ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian history]]. He spent the last sixteen years of his life in the [[Netherlands]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Scaliger was born at [[Agen]], the tenth child and third son of Italian scholar [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] and Andiette de Roques Lobejac. When he was twelve years old, he was sent with two younger brothers to the [[College of Guienne]] in [[Bordeaux]], which was then under the direction of [[Jean Gelida]]. An outbreak of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] in 1555 caused the boys to return home, and for the next few years Joseph was his father's constant companion and [[amanuensis]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Scaliger |volume=24 |pages=284–286 |first1=Richard |last1=Christie |first2=John |last2=Sandys |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of [[Latin language|Latin]] verse was the chief amusement of his father Julius in his later years, and he would daily dictate to his son between eighty and a hundred lines, and sometimes even more. Joseph was also required each day to write a Latin theme or declamation, though in other respects he seems to have been left to his own devices.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; He learned from his father to be not only a scholar, but also an acute observer, aiming at historical criticism more than at correcting texts.

===University and travels===
[[File:Scaliger.jpg|thumb|Josephus Justus Scaliger, painted by Paullus Merula, 3rd librarian of Leiden University, 1597.]]
After his father's death he spent four years at the [[University of Paris]], where he began the study of [[Greek language|Greek]] under [[Adrianus Turnebus]]. But after two months he found he was not in a position to profit from the lectures of the greatest Greek scholar of the time. He read [[Homer]] in twenty-one days, and then went through all the other Greek poets, orators and historians, forming a [[grammar]] for himself as he went along. From Greek, at the suggestion of [[Guillaume Postel]], he proceeded to attack [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and then [[Arabic language|Arabic]]; of both he acquired a respectable knowledge.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

His most important teacher was [[Jean Dorat]]. He was able not only to impart knowledge, but also to kindle enthusiasm in Scaliger. It was to Dorat that Scaliger owed his home for the next thirty years of his life, for in 1563 the professor recommended him to [[Louis de Chasteigner]], the young lord of [[La Roche-Posay]], as a companion in his travels. A close friendship sprang up between the two young men, which remained unbroken till the death of Louis in 1595. The travellers first went to [[Rome]]. Here they found [[Muretus|Marc Antoine Muret]], who, when at [[Bordeaux]] and [[Toulouse]], had been a great favourite and occasional visitor of Julius Caesar Scaliger at Agen. Muret soon recognized the young Scaliger's merits, and introduced him to many contacts well worth knowing.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

After visiting a large part of Italy, the travellers moved on to England and [[Scotland]], passing as it would seem La Roche-Posay on their way.&lt;ref&gt;Scaliger's preface to his first book, the ''Conjectanea in Varronem'', is dated there in December 1564.&lt;/ref&gt; Scaliger formed an unfavourable opinion of the English. Their inhuman disposition and inhospitable treatment of foreigners especially made a negative impression on him. He was also disappointed in finding only a few Greek manuscripts and few learned men. It was not until a much later period that he became intimate with [[Richard Thomson (theologian)|Richard Thomson]] and other Englishmen. In the course of his travels he had become a [[Protestant]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===France, Geneva, and France===
[[File:JJScaliger.jpg|thumb|Scaliger]]

On his return to France he spent three years with the Chastaigners, accompanying them to their different ''[[château]]x'' in [[Poitou]], as the calls of the civil war required. In 1570 he accepted the invitation of [[Jacques Cujas]] and proceeded to [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]] to study [[jurisprudence]] under the greatest living jurist. Here he remained three years, profiting not only by the lectures but even more by the library of Cujas, which filled no fewer than seven or eight rooms and included five hundred manuscripts.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The [[massacre of St Bartholomew]] — occurring as he was about to accompany the [[Jean de Montluc|bishop of Valence]] on an embassy to [[Poland]] — made Scaliger flee, together with other [[Huguenot]]s, for [[Geneva]], where he was appointed a professor in the academy. He lectured on the ''[[Organon]]'' of [[Aristotle]] and the ''De Finibus'' of [[Cicero]] to much satisfaction for the students, but not appreciating it himself. He hated lecturing, and was bored with the importunities of the fanatical preachers; and in 1574 he returned to France and made his home for the next twenty years with Chastaigner.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Of his life during this period we have interesting details and notices in the ''Lettres françaises inédites de Joseph Scaliger'', edited by Tamizey de Larroque (Agen, 1881). Constantly moving through [[Poitou]] and the [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]], as the exigencies of the civil war required, occasionally taking his turn as a guard, at least on one occasion trailing a pike on an expedition against the Leaguers, with no access to libraries, and frequently separated even from his own books, his life during this period seems most unsuited to study. He had, however, what so few contemporary scholars possessed—leisure, and freedom from financial cares.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Academic output===
It was during this period of his life that he composed and published his books of historical criticism. His editions of the ''Catalecta'' (1575), of [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] (1575), of [[Catullus]], [[Tibullus]] and [[Propertius]] (1577), are the work of a man determined to discover the real meaning and force of his author. He was the first to lay down and apply sound rules of criticism and emendation, and to change textual criticism from a series of haphazard guesses into a "rational procedure subject to fixed laws" ([[Mark Pattison (academic)|Mark Pattison]]).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

But these works, while proving Scaliger's right to the foremost place among his contemporaries as Latin scholar and critic, did not go beyond mere scholarship. It was reserved for his edition of [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]] (1579), and his ''De emendatione temporum'' (1583), to revolutionize perceived ideas of ancient [[chronology]]—to show that ancient history is not confined to that of the [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], but also comprises that of the [[Persia]]ns, the [[Babylonians]] and the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], hitherto neglected, and that of the [[Jews]], hitherto treated as a thing apart; and that the historical narratives and fragments of each of these, and their several systems of chronology, must be critically compared. It was this innovation that distinguished Scaliger from contemporary scholars. Neither they nor those who immediately followed seem to have appreciated his innovation. Instead, they valued his emendatory criticism and his skill in Greek. His commentary on Manilius is really a treatise on ancient [[astronomy]], and it forms an introduction to ''De emendatione temporum''; in this work Scaliger investigates ancient systems of determining [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]s, [[calendar]]s and computations of time.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Applying the work of  [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] and other modern scientists, he reveals the principles behind these systems.

In the remaining twenty-four years of his life he expanded on his work in the ''De emendatione''. He succeeded in reconstructing the lost ''Chronicle'' of [[Eusebius]]—one of the most valuable ancient documents, especially valuable for ancient chronology. This he printed in 1606 in his ''Thesaurus temporum'', in which he collected, restored, and arranged every chronological relic extant in Greek or Latin.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===The Netherlands===
[[File:Leiden - Breestraat 113.JPG|thumb|200px|Scaliger's home in Leiden, now Breestraat 113.]]
When in 1590 [[Justus Lipsius]] retired from the [[University of Leiden]], the university and its protectors, the [[Netherlands States-General|States-General]] of the [[Netherlands]] and the [[prince of Orange]], resolved to appoint Scaliger his successor. He declined; he hated lecturing, and there were those among his friends who erroneously believed that with the success of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] learning would flourish, and Protestantism would be no barrier to his advancement. The invitation was renewed in the most flattering manner a year later; the invitation stated Scaliger would not be required to lecture, and that the university wished only for his presence, while he would be able to dispose of his own time in all respects. This offer Scaliger accepted provisionally. Midway through 1593 he set out for the Netherlands, where he would pass the remaining sixteen years of his life, never returning to France. His reception at Leiden was all that he could have wished for. He received a handsome income; he was treated with the highest consideration. His supposed rank as a prince of [[Verona]] (a sensitive issue for the [[Scaligeri]]; see below) was recognized. Leiden lying between [[The Hague]] and [[Amsterdam]], Scaliger was able to enjoy, besides the learned circle of Leiden, the advantages of the best society of both these capitals. For Scaliger was no hermit buried among his books; he was fond of social intercourse and was himself a good talker.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

During the first seven years of his residence at Leiden his reputation was at its highest point. His literary judgement was unquestioned. From his throne at Leiden he ruled the learned world; a word from him could make or mar a rising reputation, and he was surrounded by young men eager to listen to and profit from his conversation. He encouraged [[Grotius]] when only a youth of sixteen to edit [[Martianus Minneus Felix Capella|Capella]]. At the early death of the younger [[Franciscus Dousa|Douza]] he wept as at that of a beloved son. [[Daniel Heinsius]], at first his favourite pupil, became his most intimate friend.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

At the same time, Scaliger had made numerous enemies. He hated ignorance, but he hated still more half-learning, and most of all dishonesty in argument or in quotation. Himself the soul of honour and truthfulness, he had no toleration for the disingenuous argument and the misstatements of facts of those who wrote to support a theory or to defend an unsound cause. His pungent sarcasm soon reached the ears of the persons who were its object, and his pen was not less bitter than his tongue. He was conscious of his power, and not always sufficiently cautious or sufficiently gentle in its exercise. Nor was he always right. He trusted much to his memory, which was occasionally treacherous. His emendations, if often valuable, were sometimes absurd. In laying the foundations of a science of ancient chronology he relied sometimes on groundless or even absurd hypotheses, often based on an [[imperfect induction]] of facts. Sometimes he misunderstood the astronomical science of the ancients, sometimes that of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] and [[Tycho Brahe]]. And he was no mathematician.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Scaliger vs. the Jesuits===
But his enemies were not merely those whose errors he had exposed and whose hostility he had excited by the violence of his language. The results of his method of historical criticism threatened the Catholic controversialists and the authenticity of many of the documents on which they relied. The [[Jesuits]], who aspired to be the source of all scholarship and criticism, saw the writings and authority of Scaliger as a formidable barrier to their claims. Muret in the latter part of his life professed the strictest orthodoxy, Lipsius had been reconciled to the Church of Rome, [[Isaac Casaubon]] was supposed to be wavering, but Scaliger was known to be an irreconcilable Protestant. As long as his intellectual supremacy was unquestioned, the Protestants had the advantage in learning and scholarship. His enemies therefore aimed, if not to answer his criticisms or to disprove his statements, yet to attack him as a man and to destroy his reputation. This was no easy task, for his moral character was absolutely spotless.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Veronese descent===
[[Image:Scaliger - Mesolabium, 1594 - 146259.jpg |thumb|''Mesolabium'', 1594]]

After several attacks purportedly by the Jesuits, in 1607 a new attempt was made. In 1594 Scaliger had published his ''Epistola de vetustate et splendore gentis Scaligerae et JC Scaligeri vita''. In 1601 [[Gaspar Scioppius]], then in the service of the Jesuits published his ''Scaliger Hypobolimaeus'' ("The Supposititious Scaliger"), a [[quarto]] volume of more than four hundred pages. The author purports to point out five hundred lies in the ''Epistola de vetustate'' of Scaliger, but the main argument of the book is to show the falsity of his pretensions to be of the family of La Scala, and of the narrative of his father's early life. "No stronger proof," says Pattison, "can be given of the impressions produced by this powerful [[philippic]], dedicated to the defamation of an individual, than that it had been the source from which the biography of Scaliger, as it now stands in our biographical collections, has mainly flowed."&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

To Scaliger, the publication of ''Scaliger Hypobolimaeus ''was crushing. Whatever his father Julius had believed, Joseph had never doubted himself to be a prince of Verona, and in his ''Epistola'' had put forth all that he had heard from his father. He wrote a reply to Scioppius, entitled ''Confutatio fabulae Burdonum''. In the opinion of Pattison, "as a refutation of Scioppius it is most complete"; but there are certainly grounds for dissenting from this judgment. Scaliger purported that Scioppius committed more blunders than he corrected, claiming that the book made untruthful allegations; but he did not succeed in adducing any proof either of his father's descent from the La Scala family, or of any of the events narrated by Julius prior to his arrival at Agen. Nor does Scaliger attempt a refutation of the crucial point, namely, that William, the last prince of Verona, had no son Nicholas, who would have been the alleged grandfather of Julius.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

But whether complete or not, the ''Confutatio'' had little success; the attack attributed to the Jesuits was successful. Scioppius was wont to boast that his book had killed Scaliger. The ''Confutatio'' was Scaliger's last work. Five months after it appeared, on 21 January 1609, at four in the morning, he died at Leiden in the arms of his son Heinsius.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; In his will Scaliger bequeathed his renowned collection of manuscripts and books (''tous mes livres de langues étrangères, Hebraiques, Syriens, Arabiques, Ethiopiens'') to [[Leiden University Library]].

==Sources==
One substantial biography of Joseph Scaliger is that of [[Jakob Bernays]] (Berlin, 1855). It was reviewed by Pattison in the ''Quarterly Review'', vol. cviii (1860), since reprinted in the ''Essays'', i (1889), 132–195. Pattison had made many manuscript collections for a life of Joseph Scaliger on a much more extensive scale, which he left unfinished. In writing the above article, [[Richard Copley Christie|Professor Christie]] had access to and made much use of these manuscripts, which include a life of Julius Caesar Scaliger. The fragments of the life of Joseph Scaliger have been printed in the ''Essays'', i. 196–245. For the life of Joseph, besides the letters published by Tamizis de Larroque (Agen, 1881), the two old collections of Latin and French letters and the two ''Scaligerana'' are the most important sources of information.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The complete correspondence of Scaliger is now available in eight volumes: ''The Correspondance of Joseph Justus Scaliger'', 8 vol. ; ed. by Paul Botley and Dirk van Miert. Supervisory editors [[Anthony Grafton]], Henk Jan De Jonge and Jill Kraye. Genève : Droz, 2012. (Travaux d'Humanisme et Renaissance ; 507). {{ISBN|978-2600-01638-4}}. 
	
For the life of Julius Caesar, the letters edited by his son, those subsequently published in 1620 by the [[President de Maussac]], the ''Scaligerana'', and his own writings are full of autobiographical matter, are the chief authorities. [[Jules de Bourousse de Laffore]]'s ''Etude sur Jules César de Lescale'' (Agen, 1860) and [[Adolphe Magen]]'s ''Documents sur Julius Caesar Scaliger et sa famille'' (Agen, 1873) add important details for the lives of both father and son. The lives by [[Charles Nisard]]—that of ''Julius et Les Gladiateurs de la république des lettres'', and that of Joseph ''Le Triumvirat littéraire au seizième siècle''—are equally unworthy of their author and their subjects. Julius is simply held up to ridicule, while the life of Joseph is almost wholly based on the book of [[Scioppius]] and the ''Scaligerana''.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

A complete list of the works of Joseph will be found in his life by Jakob Bernays. See also [[John Edwin Sandys|J. E. Sandys]], ''History of Classical Scholarship'', ii. (1908), 199–204.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; A technical biography is [[Anthony T. Grafton]], ''Joseph Scaliger: A Study in the History of Classical Scholarship'', 2 vol. (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1983, 1993).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2389">'''José María Ponce de León''' (1878–1924) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] historian and journalist. He was born in [[Uruachi]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] on March 13, 1878 and died in [[Chihuahua City]] on March 20, 1924. He was the son of Don [[Pedro Ponce de León]] and Paula Salmón.

==Education and career==
Ponce de León attended the St. Augustine College in the city of Chihuahua and later the Literary and Scientific Institute of Chihuahua in 1893. Without completing his studies he took up journalism  two years later, collaborating on ''La Idea Libre'', ''El Siglo XX'', ''El Norte'', ''El Correo de Chihuahua'' and other newspapers. From 1909 to 1911 he published the Chihuahua Magazine, which included several articles and papers on the history of Chihuahua. He was also a contributor to numerous national and international journals and a member of several scientific and cultural societies, including the Mexican Society of Geography and Statistics.

He worked for several years in the Magisterium of the city of Chihuahua. In 1905 he held the position of Chief Clerk in the Government Department, a post in which he remained until 1912. He returned to serve in the Administrative Office in 1913 and 1919 and several times he led the General Secretariat.

As head of statistics of the government of Chihuahua, which he led without prejudice, he published several important yearbooks and bulletins as well as other interesting works on the geography and history of the state, having been considered at the time as the first authority in the field.

== Critical reception ==
In 2013, [[Glen Bowersock|G.W. Bowersock]] said in a ''[[The New York Review of Books|New York Review of Books]]'' (NYRB) article that ''The Formation of Christendom'' had since its publication in 1987 meant "many historians suddenly discovered that early medieval Christianity was far more complex than they had ever imagined".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2013/11/21/storms-over-byzantium/|title=Storms over Byzantium|website=New York Review of Books|dead-url=|access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her book ''Unrivalled Influence: Women and Empire in Byzantium'' with its "comparative perspective on Byzantium, European Christendom, and Islam reflects a lifetime of distinguished work on the Byzantine Empire."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''Byzantium: The Surprising Life of a Medieval Empire'' (2007) was similarly well received by academic historians writing in the UK broadsheet press. [[Norman Stone]] commented in ''[[The Guardian]]'': "Herrin is excellent on the Ravenna of Justinian, with the extraordinary mosaics that somehow survived the second world war (when Allied bombing could be ruthless) and she is very good on that odd Byzantine (and Russian) phenomenon, the woman in power".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview7|title=Review, Byzantium, by Judith Herrin|website=The Guardian|dead-url=|access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded "Judith Herrin can work her way into the mind of Byzantium, and she gives prominence especially to the artistic side. A very good book, all in all."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', [[Noel Malcolm]] stated: "her general readers will mostly be people whose history lessons at school have left them thinking in terms of a West-centred sequence: 'Rome – Dark Ages – Middle Ages – Renaissance'. Their brains need some re-calibrating if they are to understand the rather different pattern of development that took place in the 'Rome of the East'; and that is the task which Judith Herrin has now performed, deftly and with much learning lightly worn".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/3667748/An-unusual-history-of-Byzantium.html|title=An unusual history of Byzantium|website=The Daily Telegraph|dead-url=|access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khatun''' ({{lang-uz|xotin}}, {{lang-fa|[[wikt:خاتون|خاتون]]}} ''khātūn''; [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]]: {{mongolUnicode|ᠬᠠᠲᠤᠨ|h}}, '''''khatun''''', хатан '''''khatan''''';  {{lang-ur|خاتون}} ''{{transl|ur|ALA|&lt;u&gt;kh&lt;/u&gt;ātūn}}'', plural {{lang|ur|خواتين}} ''{{transl|ur|ALA|&lt;u&gt;kh&lt;/u&gt;avātīn}}''; {{lang-bn|খাতুন}}; [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]]: &lt;span style="font-family: 'Surma';"&gt;'''ꠈꠣꠔꠥꠘ'''&lt;/span&gt; ; {{lang-tr|[[Wiktionary:hatun#Turkish|hatun]]}}) is a female title of [[nobility]] and counterpart to "[[Khan (title)|khan]]" or "[[Khagan]]" prominently used in the [[Turkic Khaganate]] and in the subsequent [[Mongol Empire]]. It is equivalent to "[[queen regnant]]" or "[[emperor|empress regnant]]", approximately.

== Etymology and history ==
Before the advent of [[Islam in Central Asia]], Khatun was the title of the queen of [[Bukhara]]. According to the [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]], "Khatun [is] a title of [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] origin borne by the wives and female relatives of the [[Göktürks|T'u-chüeh]] and subsequent Turkish rulers."&lt;ref name="FM"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mernissi, Fatima |title=The Forgotten Queens of Islam |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1993 |page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Benjamin Golden]] observed that the title ''qatun'' appeared among the [[Göktürks]] as the title for the [[khagan]]'s wife and was borrowed from [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] ''xwāten'' "wife of the ruler"&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Benjamin Golden]] (1998), "Turks and Iranians: An historical sketch" ''in'' {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Johanson|first1=Lars|last2=Csató|first2=Éva Ágnes|title=The Turkic Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rre5CAAAQBAJ|year=2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-82534-7}}, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, British [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] [[Gerard Clauson]] (1891–1974) defined ''xa:tun'' as "'lady' and the like" and says there is "no reasonable doubt that it is taken from Sogdian ''xwt'yn'' (''xwatēn''), in Sogdian ''xwt'y'' ('lord, ruler') and ''xwt'yn'' 'lord's or ruler's wife'), "which is precisely the meaning of ''xa:tun'' in the early period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Clauson, Gerard |title=An Etymological Dictionary of Pre-Thirteenth-Century Turkish |place=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1972 |pages=602–603}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern usage===
In [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], the language spoken in modern-day Bukhara, [[Uzbekistan]] the word is spelled ''[[wiktionary:uz:xotin|xotin]]'' and has come to simply refer to any woman. In [[Turkish language|Turkish]] it is written ''[[hatun]].'' The general Turkish word for 'woman', ''[[wikt:kadın|kadın]]'', is a [[doublet (linguistics)|doublet]] derived from the same origin.&lt;ref&gt;Clauson, p. 602.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Urdu]], the word ''khatun'' is used commonly to refer to any woman. The female title ''[[khanum]]'' is also used as the feminine counterpart of ''[[Khan (title)|khan]]''.

==Notable Khatuns==
* [[Börte]], wife of [[Genghis Khan]]
* [[Buluqhan Khatun]], wife of [[Abaqa Khan]]
* [[Bulugan]], wife of [[Temur Khan]]
* [[Chabi]], wife of [[Kublai Khan]]
* [[Despina Khatun]]

'''Königsberg''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkøːnɪçsˌbɛɐ̯k}}) is the name for a former German city that is now [[Kaliningrad]], [[Russia]]. Originally a [[Sambian]] or [[Old Prussians|Old Prussian]] city, it later belonged to the [[State of the Teutonic Order]], the [[Duchy of Prussia]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the [[German Empire]], the [[Weimar Republic]]  and [[Nazi Germany]] until 1945. After being largely destroyed in [[World War II]] by [[bombing of Königsberg in World War II|Allied bombing]] and
Soviet forces and annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] thereafter, the city was renamed [[Kaliningrad]]. Few traces of the former Königsberg remain today.

The literal meaning of Königsberg is 'King’s Mountain'. In the local [[Low German]] dialect, spoken by many of its [[Germans|German]] former inhabitants, the name was ''Kenigsbarg'' ({{IPA-de|ˈkʰeːnɪçsbarç|pron}}). Further names included {{lang-rus|Кёнигсберг, Королевец|r=Kyonigsberg, Korolevets}}, [[Old Prussian language|Old Prussian]]: ''Kunnegsgarbs, Knigsberg'', {{lang-lt|Karaliaučius}}, {{lang-pl|Królewiec}} and [[Yiddish]]: קעניגסבערג ''Kenigsberg''.

Königsberg was founded in 1255 on the site of the ancient [[Old Prussian]] settlement ''Twangste'' by the [[Teutonic Knights]] during the [[Northern Crusades]], and was named in honour of King [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]].&lt;ref name="Routledge Companion to Medieval Warfare"/&gt; A [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] port city, it successively became the capital of [[State of the Teutonic Order|their monastic state]], the [[Duchy of Prussia]] (1525–1701) and [[East Prussia]]. Königsberg remained the coronation city of the Prussian monarchy, though the capital was moved to [[Berlin]] in 1701.

A university city, home of the [[Albertina University]] (founded in 1544), Königsberg developed into an important German intellectual and cultural centre, being the residence of [[Simon Dach]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Käthe Kollwitz]], [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], [[David Hilbert]], [[Agnes Miegel]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Michael Wieck]] and others.

Between the thirteenth and the twentieth centuries, the inhabitants spoke predominantly [[German language|German]]{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}, but the multicultural city also had a profound influence on the Lithuanian and Polish cultures.&lt;ref name="zien"/&gt; The city was a publishing centre of Lutheran literature, including the first Polish translation of the [[New Testament]], printed in the city in 1551, the first book in the [[Lithuanian language]] and the first Lutheran catechism, both printed in Königsberg in 1547.

Königsberg was the easternmost large city in Germany until World War II. The city was heavily damaged by [[bombing of Königsberg in World War II|Allied bombing]] in 1944 and during the [[Battle of Königsberg]] in 1945; it was then captured and occupied by the Soviet Union on 9 April 1945. Its German population was [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|expelled]], and the city was repopulated with [[Russians]] and others from the Soviet Union. Briefly [[Russification|Russified]] as Kyonigsberg (Кёнигсберг), it was renamed "Kaliningrad" in 1946 in honour of Soviet leader [[Mikhail Kalinin]]. It is now the capital of Russia's [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], an [[enclave]] bordered in the north by [[Lithuania]] and in the south by [[Poland]].

There has been some [[Königsberg question|discussion of the territory's current legal status]], although this is largely academic. The [[Potsdam Agreement]] placed it provisionally under Soviet administration, but did not mention an explicit right of annexation. In the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Final Settlement]] treaty of 1990, [[Germany]] renounced all claim to it, but without specifically transferring its former title to any other party.&lt;ref name="lituanus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lituanus.org/1992_1/92_1_02.htm|title=THE STATUS OF THE KALININGRAD OBLAST UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW, LITHUANIAN QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ARTS AND SCIENCES|publisher=lituanus.org|accessdate=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of Kaliningrad history}}

===Sambians===
Königsberg was preceded by a [[Sambian]], or [[Old Prussians|Old Prussian]], fort known as ''Twangste'' (''Tuwangste'', ''Tvankste''), meaning Oak Forest,&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=QI0eAQAAMAAJ |page=609 |title=The Monthly Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as several Old Prussian settlements, including the fishing village and port [[Löbenicht|Lipnick]], and the farming villages [[Sackheim|Sakkeim]] and [[Tragheim|Trakkeim]].

===Teutonic Order===
During the conquest of the Prussian [[Sambians]] by the [[Teutonic Knights]] in 1255, Twangste was destroyed and replaced with a new fortress known as ''Conigsberg''. This name meant "King’s Barrow" ({{lang-la|castrum Koningsberg, Mons Regius, Regiomontium}}), honoring King [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Ottokar II]] of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], who paid for the erection of the first fortress there during the [[Prussian Crusade]].&lt;ref name="biskup"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koch, Hannsjoachim Wolfgang (1978). A history of Prussia. Longman P4&lt;/ref&gt; Northwest of this new [[Königsberg Castle]] arose an initial settlement, later known as [[Steindamm (Königsberg)|Steindamm]], roughly {{convert|4.5|mi|0|abbr=out}} from the [[Vistula Lagoon]].&lt;ref name="B174"/&gt;

The Teutonic Order used Königsberg to fortify their conquests in [[Sambia|Samland]] and as a base for campaigns against pagan [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]. [[Siege of Königsberg|Under siege]] during the [[Prussian uprisings]] in 1262–63, Königsberg Castle was relieved by the Master of the [[Livonian Order]].&lt;ref name="seward"/&gt;&lt;ref name="turnbull"/&gt; Because the initial northwestern settlement was destroyed by the Prussians during the rebellion, rebuilding occurred in the southern valley between the castle hill and the [[Pregolya River|Pregel River]]. This new settlement, [[Altstadt (Königsberg)|Altstadt]], received [[Kulm law|Culm rights]] in 1286. [[Löbenicht]], a new town directly east of Altstadt between the Pregel and the [[Schlossteich]], received its own rights in 1300. Medieval Königsberg's third town was [[Kneiphof]], which received town rights in 1327 and was located on an island of the same name in the Pregel south of Altstadt.

Within the [[state of the Teutonic Order]], Königsberg was the residence of the marshal, one of the chief administrators of the military order.&lt;ref name="christiansen"/&gt; The city was also the seat of the [[Bishopric of Samland]], one of the four [[diocese]]s into which [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] had been divided in 1243 by the [[papal legate]], [[William of Modena]]. [[Adalbert of Prague]] became the main [[patron saint]] of [[Königsberg Cathedral]], a landmark of the city located in Kneiphof.

Königsberg joined the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1340 and developed into an important port for the south-eastern Baltic region, trading goods throughout Prussia, the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]], and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. The chronicler [[Peter of Dusburg]] probably wrote his ''Chronicon terrae Prussiae'' in Königsberg from 1324–1330.&lt;ref name="Christiansen, p. 224"/&gt; After the Teutonic Order's victory over pagan [[Lithuanians]] in the 1348 [[Battle of Strawen]], Grand Master [[Winrich von Kniprode]] established a [[Cistercian nunnery]] in the city.&lt;ref name="christiansen1"/&gt; Aspiring students were educated in Königsberg before continuing on to higher education elsewhere, such as [[Charles University in Prague|Prague]] or [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]].&lt;ref name="Christiansen, p. 224"/&gt;

Although the knights suffered a crippling defeat in the [[Battle of Grunwald|Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg)]], Königsberg remained under the control of the Teutonic Knights throughout the [[Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War]]. Livonian knights replaced the Prussian branch's garrison at Königsberg, allowing them to participate in the recovery of towns occupied by [[Władysław II Jagiełło]]'s troops.&lt;ref name="urban"/&gt;
[[File:AGAD Stany pruskie oddaja swe ziemie krolowi polskiemu Kazimierzowi Jagiellonczykowi i koronie polskiej.jpg|thumb|266px|Prussian Confederation offered to incorporate Prussia into the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]], 1454, [[Central Archives of Historical Records]], Warsaw]]
In 1454 the [[Prussian Confederation]] rebelled against the Teutonic Knights and formally asked the Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon, to incorporate Prussia into the Kingdom of Poland as a fief. This marked the beginning of the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454-66)]] between the [[State of the Teutonic Order]] and the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]]. While Königsberg's three towns initially joined the rebellion, Altstadt and Löbenicht soon rejoined the Teutonic Knights and defeated Kneiphof in 1455. Grand Master [[Ludwig von Erlichshausen]] fled from the crusaders' capital at [[Castle Marienburg]] to Königsberg in 1457; the city's magistrate presented Erlichshausen with a barrel of beer out of compassion.&lt;ref name="koch2"/&gt; When [[Royal Prussia|western Prussia]] was transferred to victorious Poland in the [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)]], which ended the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)|Thirteen Years' War]], Königsberg became the new capital of the reduced monastic state, which became a fief of the [[Crown of the Polish Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="christiansen3"/&gt; The grand masters took over the quarters of the marshal. During the [[Polish-Teutonic War (1519–1521)]], Königsberg was unsuccessfully&lt;ref name="urban4"/&gt; besieged by Polish forces led by Grand Crown Hetman [[Mikołaj Firlej (?-1526)|Mikołaj Firlej]].

===Duchy of Prussia===
[[File:Kaliningrad 05-2017 img04 Kant Island.jpg|thumb|The 14th-century [[Königsberg Cathedral]]]]

Through the preachings of the [[Bishopric of Samland|Bishop of Samland]], [[Georg von Polenz]], Königsberg became predominantly [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] during the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref name="koch5"/&gt; After summoning a [[quorum]] of the Knights to Königsberg, Grand Master [[Albert, Duke of Prussia|Albert of Brandenburg]] (a member of the [[House of Hohenzollern]]) secularised the Teutonic Knights' remaining territories in Prussia in 1525 and converted to Lutheranism.&lt;ref name="christiansen6"/&gt; By paying [[Prussian Homage|feudal homage]] to his uncle, King [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund I of Poland]], Albert became the first duke of the new [[Duchy of Prussia]], a fief of Poland.

While the Prussian estates quickly allied with the duke, the Prussian peasantry would only swear allegiance to Albert in person at Königsberg, seeking the duke's support against oppressive nobility. After convincing the rebels to lay down their arms, Albert had several of their leaders executed.&lt;ref name="koch7"/&gt;

Königsberg, the capital, became one of the biggest cities and ports of ducal Prussia, having considerable autonomy, a separate [[parliament]] and currency. While [[German language|German]] served as the fief's official language, the city served as a vibrant center of publishing in both the [[Polish Language|Polish]] and [[Lithuanian Language]]s. The city flourished through the export of [[wheat]], [[timber]], [[hemp]], and [[furs]],&lt;ref name="koch8"/&gt; as well as [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]], [[tar]], and [[fly ash|ash]].&lt;ref name="northern"/&gt; Königsberg was one of the few Baltic ports regularly visited by more than one hundred ships annually in the latter 16th century, along with [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] and [[Riga]].&lt;ref name="northern9"/&gt; The [[University of Königsberg]], founded by Albert in 1544 and receiving the royal [[Law of Privilege|privilege]] from King [[Sigismund II Augustus]] of Poland in 1560, became a centre of Protestant teaching. The university had a profound impact on the development of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanian]] culture, and several important Lithuanian writers attended the ''Albertina''. The university was also the preferred educational institution of the [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] nobility.

The capable Duke Albert was succeeded by his feeble minded son, [[Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia|Albert Frederick]]. Anna, daughter of Albert Frederick, married Elector [[John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg|John Sigismund]] of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], who was granted{{by whom|date=January 2012}} the right of [[Order of succession|succession]] to Prussia on Albert Frederick's death in 1618. From this time the [[Elector of Brandenburg|Electors of Brandenburg]], the rulers of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], governed the Duchy of Prussia and Königsberg.

===Brandenburg-Prussia===

When Imperial and then [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] armies over-ran Brandenburg during the [[Thirty Years' War]] of 1618-1648, the Hohenzollern court fled to Königsberg. On 1 November 1641, Elector [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]] persuaded the Prussian diet to accept an [[excise tax]].&lt;ref name="koch10"/&gt; In the [[Treaty of Königsberg (1656)|Treaty of Königsberg]] of January 1656, the elector recognised his Duchy of Prussia as a fief of Sweden. In the [[Treaty of Wehlau]] in 1657, however, he negotiated the release of Prussia from [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish sovereignty]] in return for an alliance with Poland. The 1660 [[Treaty of Oliva]] confirmed Prussian independence from both Poland and Sweden.

In 1661 Frederick William informed the Prussian diet that he possessed ''jus supremi et absoluti domini'', and that the [[Prussian Landtag]] could convene with his permission.&lt;ref name="Koch56"/&gt; The Königsberg burghers, led by [[Hieronymus Roth]] of Kneiphof, opposed "the Great Elector's" [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] claims, and actively rejected the Treaties of Wehlau and Oliva, seeing Prussia as "indisputably contained within the territory of the Polish Crown".&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; Delegations from the city's burghers went to the Polish king, [[Jan Kazimierz]], who initially promised aid, but then failed to follow through.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; The town's residents attacked the elector's troops while local Lutheran priests held masses for the Polish king and for the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; However, Frederick William succeeded in imposing his authority after arriving with 3,000 troops in October 1662 and training his artillery on the town.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; Refusing to request mercy, Roth went to prison in [[Peitz]] until his death in 1678.&lt;ref name=Koch56/&gt;

The Prussian estates which swore fealty to Frederick William in Königsberg on 18 October 1663&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt; refused the elector's requests for military funding, and Colonel [[Christian Ludwig von Kalckstein]] sought assistance from neighbouring Poland. After the elector's agents had abducted Kalckstein, he was executed in 1672. The Prussian estates' submission to Frederick William followed; in 1673 and 1674 the elector received taxes not granted by the estates and Königsberg received a garrison without the estates' consent.&lt;ref name="koch11"/&gt; The economic and political weakening of Königsberg strengthened the power of the [[Junker]] nobility within Prussia.&lt;ref name="holborn"/&gt;

Königsberg long remained a centre of Lutheran resistance to [[Calvinism]] within [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]; Frederick William forced the city to accept Calvinist citizens and property-holders in 1668.&lt;ref name="clark12"/&gt;

===Kingdom of Prussia===
[[File:Preussen 1701 Königsberg.jpg|thumb|Coronation of [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]], [[King in Prussia]], in 1701.]]

By the act of coronation in [[Königsberg Castle]] on 18 January 1701, Frederick William's son, Elector Frederick III, became [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]], [[King in Prussia]]. The elevation of the Duchy of Prussia to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] was possible because the Hohenzollerns' authority in Prussia was independent of Poland and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Since "Kingdom of Prussia" was increasingly used to designate all of the Hohenzollern lands, former ducal Prussia became known as the [[Province of Prussia]] (1701–1773), with Königsberg as its capital. However, Berlin and [[Potsdam]] in Brandenburg were the main residences of the Prussian kings.

The city was wracked by [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and other illnesses from September 1709 to April 1710, losing 9,368 people, or roughly a quarter of its populace.&lt;ref name="northern13"/&gt; On 13 June 1724, [[Altstadt (Königsberg)|Altstadt]], [[Kneiphof]], and [[Löbenicht]] [[amalgamation (politics)|amalgamated]] to formally create the larger city Königsberg.

===Russian Empire===
During the [[Seven Years' War]] [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] troops occupied eastern Prussia at the beginning of 1758 . On 31 December 1757, Empress [[Elizabeth I of Russia|Elizabeth I]] of [[Empire of Russia|Russia]] issued an ''[[ukase]]'' about the incorporation of Königsberg into Russia.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; On 24 January 1758, the leading burghers of Königsberg submitted to Elizabeth.&lt;ref name="holborn14"/&gt; Five [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] general-governors administered the city during the war from 1758–62; they included [[William Fermor]] and [[Nikolaus Friedrich von Korff]]. With the end of the Seven Years' War the Russian army abandoned the town in 1763.&lt;ref name="anthropology"/&gt;

===Kingdom of Prussia===
After the [[Partitions of Poland|First Partition of Poland]] in 1772, Königsberg became the capital of the [[province of East Prussia]] in 1773, which replaced the Province of Prussia in 1773. By 1800 the city was approximately five miles ({{convert|5|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only}}) in circumference and had 60,000 inhabitants, including a military garrison of 7,000, making it one of the most populous German cities of the time.&lt;ref name="comparison"/&gt;

[[File:Reorganisation.jpg|thumb|Meeting of the [[Prussian Army]] reformers (''Heeresreform'') in Königsberg in 1807, [[lithograph]] by [[Carl Röchling]]]]

After Prussia's defeat at the hands of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1806 during the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]], King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] fled with his court from Berlin to Königsberg.&lt;ref name="koch15"/&gt; The city was a centre for political resistance to Napoleon. In order to foster [[liberalism]] and [[nationalism]] among the Prussian middle class, the "League of Virtue" was founded in Königsberg in April 1808. The [[First French Empire|French]] forced its dissolution in December 1809, but its ideals were continued by the ''[[Turnbewegung]]'' of [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]] in Berlin.&lt;ref name="koch16"/&gt; Königsberg officials, such as [[Johann Gottfried Frey]], formulated much of [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Stein]]'s 1808 ''Städteordnung'', or new order for urban communities, which emphasised self-administration for Prussian towns.&lt;ref name="holborn17"/&gt; The East Prussian ''[[Landwehr]]'' was organised from the city after the [[Convention of Tauroggen]].&lt;ref name="clark18"/&gt;

In 1819 Königsberg had a population of 63,800.&lt;ref name="holborn19"/&gt; It served as the capital of the united [[Province of Prussia]] from 1824–1878, when East Prussia was merged with [[West Prussia]]. It was also the seat of the [[Königsberg (region)|Regierungsbezirk Königsberg]], an administrative subdivision.&lt;ref&gt;Hauf, R (1980) The Prussian administration of the district of Königsberg, 1871-1920, Quelle &amp; Meyer, Wiebelsheim P21&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by the provincial president [[Theodor von Schön]] and the ''[[Königsberger Volkszeitung]]'' newspaper, Königsberg was a stronghold of [[liberalism]] against the conservative government of King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]].&lt;ref name="clark20"/&gt; During the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|revolution of 1848]], there were 21 episodes of public unrest in the city;&lt;ref name="clark21"/&gt; major demonstrations were suppressed.&lt;ref name="holborn22"/&gt; Königsberg became part of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 during the Prussian-led [[unification of Germany]]. A sophisticated for its time [[Königsberg fortifications|series of fortifications]] around the city that included fifteen forts was completed in 1888.&lt;ref name="Museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world-ocean.ru/en/monuments/posolstvo/past.php|title=The Past...|publisher=Museum of the World Ocean|accessdate=2011-01-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310062628/http://www.world-ocean.ru/en/monuments/posolstvo/past.php|archivedate=10 March 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extensive [[Prussian Eastern Railway]] linked the city to [[Breslau]], [[Toruń|Thorn]], [[Insterburg]], [[Eydtkuhnen]], [[Tilsit]], and [[Pillau]]. In 1860 the railway connecting [[Berlin]] with [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] was completed and increased Königsberg's commerce. Extensive electric tramways were in operation by 1900; and regular steamers plied to [[Klaipėda|Memel]], [[Tapiau]] and [[Labiau]], [[Zelenogradsk|Cranz]], Tilsit, and [[Danzig]]. The completion of a canal to Pillau in 1901 increased the trade of Russian grain in Königsberg, but, like much of eastern Germany, the city's economy was generally in decline.&lt;ref name="baltic"/&gt; The city was an important entrepôt for Scottish herring. in 1904 the export peaked at more than 322 thousand barrels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scottishherringhistory.uk/statistics/AnnualExport.html|title=Annual Statistics|author=|date=|website=scottishherringhistory.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900 the city's population had grown to 188,000, with a 9,000-strong military garrison.&lt;ref name="B174"/&gt; By 1914 Königsberg had a population of 246,000;&lt;ref name="baltic23"/&gt; [[Jew]]s flourished in the culturally pluralistic city.&lt;ref name="clark24"/&gt;

===Weimar Republic===
[[File:East Prussia 1923-1939.png|right|thumb|Königsberg within the borders of [[Province of East Prussia|East Prussia]] from 1919 to 1939.]]
Following the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], Imperial Germany was replaced with the democratic [[Weimar Republic]]. The Kingdom of Prussia ended with the abdication of the Hohenzollern monarch, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], and the kingdom was succeeded by the [[Free State of Prussia]]. Königsberg and [[Province of East Prussia|East Prussia]], however, were separated from the rest of Weimar Germany by the creation of the [[Polish Corridor]].

===Nazi Germany===
In the 1930s Nazis confiscated Jewish shops and, as in the rest of Germany, a [[Nazi book burnings|public book burning]] was organised, accompanied by anti-Semitic speeches in May 1933 at the Trommelplatz square. Street names and monuments of Jewish origin were removed, and signs such as "Jews are not welcomed in hotels" started appearing. As part of the state-wide [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service|"aryanisation" of the civil service]] Jewish academics were ejected from the university.&lt;ref&gt;Janusz Jasinski, Historia Krolewca, 1994, page 251-252&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932 the local paramilitary [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] had already started to terrorise their political opponents. On the night of 31 July 1932 there was a bomb attack on the headquarters of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] in Königsberg, the [[Otto Braun|Otto-Braun-House]]. The Communist politician Gustav Sauf was killed, and the executive editor of the Social Democrat ''"Königsberger Volkszeitung"'', Otto Wyrgatsch, and the [[German People's Party]] politician Max von Bahrfeldt were severely injured. Members of the [[Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold|Reichsbanner]] were attacked and the local Reichsbanner Chairman of [[Lötzen]], Kurt Kotzan, was murdered on 6 August 1932.&lt;ref name=Matull&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.fes.de/breslau/pdf/a20715/a20715_06.pdf|title=Ostdeutschlands Arbeiterbewegung: Abriß ihrer Geschichte, Leistung und Opfer

In July 1934 Adolf Hitler made a speech in the city, gathering 25,000 supporters.&lt;ref name="Jasinski 249"&gt;Janusz Jasinski, Historia Krolewca, 1994, page 249&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 the NSDAP alone received 54% of votes in the city.&lt;ref name="Jasinski 249"/&gt;
After the Nazis took power in Germany, opposition politicians were persecuted and newspapers were banned. The Otto-Braun-House was requisitioned and became the headquarters of the SA, which used the house to imprison and torture opponents. [[Walter Schütz]], a communist member of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], was murdered here.&lt;ref&gt;Matull, page 357&lt;/ref&gt; Many who would not co-operate with the rulers of [[Nazi Germany]] were sent to [[concentration camps]] and held prisoner there until their death or liberation.

In 1935, the [[Wehrmacht]] designated Königsberg as the Headquarters for [[Military district (Germany)|Wehrkreis I]] (under the command of General der Artillerie [[Albert Wodrig]]), which took in all of [[Province of East Prussia|East Prussia]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} According to the census of May 1939, Königsberg had a population of 372,164.&lt;ref name="autogenerated"/&gt;

====Persecution of Jews under the Nazi regime====
Prior to the Nazi era, Königsberg was home to a third of East Prussia's 13,000 Jews. Under Nazi rule, the Polish and Jewish minorities were classified as ''[[Untermensch]]'' and persecuted by the authorities. The city's Jewish population shrank from 3,200 in 1933 to 2,100 in October 1938. The [[Synagogue (Königsberg)|New Synagogue of Königsberg]], constructed in 1896, was destroyed during [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938); 500 Jews soon fled the city.

After the [[Wannsee Conference]] of 20 January 1942, Königsberg's Jews began to be deported to camps such as [[Maly Trostenets extermination camp|Maly Trostenets]], [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]], and [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]].&lt;ref name="Ost.net"/&gt;

====Persecution of Poles during World War II====
In September 1939, with the German invasion against Poland under way, the Polish consulate in Königsberg was attacked (which constituted a violation of international law), its workers arrested and sent to concentration camps where several of them died.&lt;ref name="Jasinski 256"&gt;Janusz Jasinski, Historia Krolewca, 1994, page 256&lt;/ref&gt; Polish students at the local university were captured, tortured and finally executed.&lt;ref name="Jasinski 256"/&gt; Other victims included local Polish civilians guillotined for petty violations of Nazi law and regulations such as buying and selling meat.&lt;ref name="Jasinski 256"/&gt;

In September 1944 69,000 slave labourers were registered in the city (not counting prisoners of war), with most of them working on the outskirts; within the city were 15,000 slave labourers.&lt;ref name="j257"&gt;Janusz Jasinski, ''Historia Krolewca'', 1994, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; All of them were denied freedom of movement, forced to wear a "P" sign, if Poles, or "Ost" sign, if they were from the Soviet Union, and were watched by special units of the Gestapo and Wehrmacht.&lt;ref name=j257/&gt; They were denied basic spiritual and physical needs and food, and suffered from famine and exhaustion.&lt;ref name=j257/&gt; The conditions of the forced labour were described as "tragic", especially for Poles and Russians, who were treated harshly by their German overseers. Ordered to paint German ships with toxic paints and chemicals, they were neither given gas-masks nor was there any ventilation in facilities where they worked, supposedly in order to expedite construction, while the substances evaporated in temperatures as low as 40 Celsius. As a result, there were cases of sudden illness or death during the work.&lt;ref name=j257/&gt;

====Destruction in World War II====
{{main|Bombing of Königsberg in World War II|Battle of Königsberg}}
In 1944, Königsberg suffered heavy damage from [[Bombing of Königsberg in World War II|British bombing attacks]] and burned for several days. The historic city centre, especially the original quarters Altstadt, Löbenicht, and Kneiphof, was destroyed, including the cathedral, the castle, all churches of the old city, the old and the new universities, and the old shipping quarters.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, M (1989) Second World War, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, P582-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people fled from Königsberg ahead of the [[Red Army]]'s advance after October 1944, particularly after word spread of the Soviet atrocities at [[Nemmersdorf massacre|Nemmersdorf]].&lt;ref name="berlin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="translated"/&gt;  In early 1945, Soviet forces, under the command of the Polish-born Soviet Marshal [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]], besieged the city that Hitler had envisaged as the home for a museum holding all the Germans had 'found in Russia'.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, M (1989) ''Second World War'', Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, P291&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Battle of Königsberg|Operation Samland]], [[Hovhannes Bagramyan|General Baghramyan's]] [[1st Baltic Front]], now known as the [[Sambia|Samland]] Group, captured Königsberg in April.&lt;ref name="generals"/&gt;  Although [[Hitler]] had declared Königsberg an "invincible bastion of German spirit", the Soviets captured the city after a three-month-long siege. A temporary German breakout had allowed some of the remaining civilians to escape via train and naval evacuation from the nearby port of Pillau. Königsberg, which had been declared a "fortress" (''[[German World War II strongholds|Festung]]'') by the Germans, was fanatically defended.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, A (2002) ''Berlin: The Downfall 1945'' Penguin Books. p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 January, during the [[Red Army]]'s [[East Prussian Offensive]], mostly Polish and Hungarian Jews from Seerappen, Jesau, [[Heiligenbeil concentration camp|Heiligenbeil]], Schippenbeil, and Gerdauen (subcamps of [[Stutthof concentration camp]]) were gathered in Königsberg by the Nazis. Up to 7,000 of them were forced on a [[Death marches (Holocaust)|death march]] to [[Sambia]]: those that survived were subsequently executed at [[Yantarny|Palmnicken]].&lt;ref name="Ost.net"/&gt;

On 9 April – one month before the end of the war in Europe – the German military commander of Königsberg, General [[Otto Lasch]], surrendered the remnants of his forces, following the three-month-long [[Battle of Königsberg|siege by the Red Army]]. For this act, Lasch was condemned to death, in absentia, by Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, M (1989) ''Second World War'', Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, P660&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the surrender, military and civilian dead in the city were estimated at 42,000, with the Red Army claiming over 90,000 prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, M (2005) 2nd ed ''Armageddon: The Battle for Germany 1944-45'', Pan Macmillan, P291&lt;/ref&gt; Lasch's subterranean command bunker is preserved as a museum in today's Kaliningrad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitkaliningrad.com/bunkermuseum.html |title=visitkaliningrad.com |publisher=visitkaliningrad.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-093-65, Flüchtlinge auf Schiff.jpg|thumbnail|Refugees fleeing from Königsberg before the advancing Red Army in 1945]]

About 120,000 survivors remained in the ruins of the devastated city. These survivors, mainly women, children and the elderly, plus a few others who had returned immediately after the fighting ended, were held as slave labourers until 1949. The vast majority of the German civilians left in Königsberg after 1945 died from disease or deliberate starvation, or in revenge-driven ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref name="cleansing1944"/&gt; The remaining 20,000 German residents were [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled]] in 1949–50.&lt;ref name="university"/&gt;

===Soviet/Russian Kaliningrad===
{{main|Kaliningrad}}

As agreed by the Allies at the [[Potsdam Conference]], northern Prussia, including Königsberg, was annexed by the USSR, which attached it to the [[Russian SFSR]]. In 1946, the city's name was changed to [[Kaliningrad]]. Northern Prussia remained part of the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991, and since then has been an [[enclave]] of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]].

==Demographics==
The vast majority of the population belonged to the [[Evangelical Church of Prussia]]. A majority of its parishioners were [[Lutherans]], although there were also [[Calvinists]].

===Jews===
[[File:Синагога Кёнигсберга 1.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Königsberg Synagogue|New Synagogue]]]]
{{main|History of the Jews in Königsberg}}
The Jewish community in the city had its origins in the 16th century, with the arrival of the first Jews in 1538. The first synagogue was built in 1756. A second, smaller synagogue which served Orthodox Jews was constructed later, eventually becoming the [[Königsberg Synagogue|New Synagogue]].

The Jewish population of Königsberg in the 18th century was fairly low, although this changed as restrictions&lt;ref name="Mendelssohn"/&gt; became relaxed over the course of the 19th century. In 1756 there were 29 families of "protected Jews" in Königsberg, which increased to 57 by 1789. The total number of Jewish inhabitants was less than 500 in the middle of the 18th century, and around 800 by the end of it, out of a total population of almost 60,000 people.&lt;ref name="Jasinski"/&gt;

The number of Jewish inhabitants peaked in 1880 at about 5,000, many of whom were migrants escaping [[pogroms]] in the [[Russian empire]]. This number declined subsequently so that by 1933, when the [[Nazis]] took over, the city had about 3,200 Jews. As a result of anti-semitism and persecution in the 1920s and 1930s two thirds of the city's Jews emigrated, mostly to the US and Great Britain. Those who remained were shipped by the Germans to concentration camps in two waves; first in 1938 to various camps in Germany, and the second in 1942 to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] in occupied [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Kaiserwald concentration camp]] in occupied [[Latvia]], as well as camps in [[Maly Trostenets extermination camp|Minsk]] in the occupied [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]].&lt;ref name="The Fall of Hitler's Fortress City: The Battle for Königsberg, 1945"/&gt;

===Lithuanians===
The [[University of Königsberg]] was an important centre of Protestant Lithuanian culture and studies.&lt;ref name="Piłat1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walenty Piłat|title=W kre̢gu kultur bałtyckich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RpMiAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=6 October 2012|year=1998|publisher=Wyższa Szkoła Pedagogiczna|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraomas Kulvietis]] and [[Stanislovas Rapalionis]] are also seen as important early Lithuanian scholars.&lt;ref name="Piłat1998"/&gt; [[Daniel Klein (grammarian)|Daniel Klein]] published the first Lithuanian grammar book in Königsberg in 1653.

During the Reformation Königsberg became a place of refuge for Polish Protestant adherents, a training ground for Polish Protestant clergy and a source of Polish Protestant literature.&lt;ref name="cambridge"/&gt; In 1564 [[Jan Mączyński]] issued his Polish-Latin lexicon at Königsberg.&lt;ref name="hippocrene"/&gt;

According to historian [[Janusz Jasiński]], based on estimates obtained from the records of St. Nicholas's Church, during the 1530s Lutheran Poles constituted about one quarter of the city population. This does not include Polish [[Catholics]] or [[Calvinists]] who did not have centralised places of worship until the 17th century, hence records that far back for these two groups are not available.&lt;ref name="Jasinski"/&gt;

From the 16th to 20th centuries, the city was a publishing centre of Polish-language religious literature. In 1545 in Königsberg a Polish catechism was printed by [[Jan Seklucjan]].&lt;ref name="bibel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cambridge27"/&gt; In 1551 the first translation of the [[New Testament]] in [[Polish language]] came out, issued by [[Stanisław Murzynowski]].&lt;ref name="bibel"/&gt; Murzynowski's collections of sermons were delivered by [[Eustachy Trepka]] and in 1574 by [[Hieronim Malecki]]. The works of [[Mikolaj Rej]] were printed here by Seklucjan.&lt;ref name="context"/&gt; [[Maciej Stryjkowski]] announced in Königsberg the publication of his ''Kronika Polska, Litewska, Żmudzka, i wszystkiej Rusi'' ("A Chronicle of Poland, Lithuania, Samogitia and all Rus").&lt;ref name="morf"/&gt;

Although formally the relationship of these lands with Poland stopped at the end of the 17th century, in practice the Polish element in Königsberg played a significant role for the next century, until the outbreak of World War II.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Before the second half of the 19th century many municipal institutions (e.g. courts, magistrates) employed Polish translators, and there was a course in the Polish language at the university.&lt;ref name="AugusiewiczJasiński2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sławomir Augusiewicz|author2=Janusz Jasiński|author3=Tadeusz Oracki|title=Wybitni Polacy w Królewcu: XVI-XX wiek|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L99oAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=7 October 2012|year=2005|publisher=Wydawnictwo "Littera"|isbn=978-83-89775-03-0|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polish books were issued as well as magazines with the last one being the ''Kalendarz Staropruski Ewangelicki'' (Old Prussian Evangelical Calendar) issued between 1866 and 1931.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt;

During the Protestant Reformation the oldest church in Königsberg, [[Steindamm Church|St. Nicholas]], was opened for non-Germans, especially Lithuanians and Poles.&lt;ref name="rautenberg"/&gt; Services for Lithuanians started in 1523, and by the mid-16th century also included ones for Poles.&lt;ref name="Andreas Osiander. Gesamtausgabe. Schriften und Briefe 1549 bis August 1551"/&gt; By 1603 it had become a solely Polish-language church as Lithuanian service was moved to St. [[St. Elisabeth's Church, Königsberg|Elizabeth]]. In 1880 St. Nicholas was converted to a German-language church; weekly Polish services remained only for Masurians in the [[Prussian Army]], although those were halted in 1901.&lt;ref name="Gause693"/&gt; The church was bombed in 1944, further destroyed in 1945, and the remaining ruins were dismantled after the war in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Wacław Podbereski, Sąsiedzi: Królewiec – Koenigsberg – Kaliningrad [w:] "Znad Wilii" nr 4(44) 2010, s. 113-117&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable people===
{{further|List of people from Königsberg}}
Königsberg was the birthplace of the mathematician [[Christian Goldbach]] and the writer [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]], as well as the home of the philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]], who lived there virtually all his life and rarely travelled more than ten miles ({{convert|10|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only}}) away from the city.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Rick. 2005. 'Kant 200 Years On'. ''Philosophy Now''. No. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant entered the university of Königsberg at age 16 and was appointed to a chair in metaphysics there in 1770 at the age of 46. While working there he published his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (arguing that knowledge arises from the application of innate concepts to sensory experience) and his ''[[Metaphysics of Morals]]'' which argues that virtue is acquired by the performance of duty for its own sake.&lt;ref name="introduction"/&gt; In 1736, the mathematician [[Leonhard Euler]] used the arrangement of the city's bridges and islands as the basis for the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg|Seven Bridges of Königsberg Problem]], which led to the mathematical branches of [[topology]] and [[graph theory]]. In the 19th century Königsberg was the birthplace of the influential mathematician [[David Hilbert]].

===Languages===
The language of government and high culture was [[German language|German]]. [[Low Prussian]] was widely spoken, but is now a [[moribund language]] as its refugee speakers are elderly and dying out.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} As the capital of the [[Prussia (region)|region of East Prussia]] which was a multiethnic territory, peoples speaking diverse languages such as [[Kursenieki#Language|Latvian]], [[Lithuanian Language|Lithuanian]], [[Masurian dialect|Polish]], and [[Yiddish Language|Yiddish]] were commonly heard on the streets of Königsberg. [[Old Prussian Language|Old Prussian]], a [[Baltic language]], became extinct in the [[18th century]].

===The visual and performing arts===
[[File:Normal koenigstor 1849.jpg|thumb|left|The [[King's Gate (Kaliningrad)|Königstor (King's Gate)]] in the 19th century]]
In the Königsstraße (King Street) stood the Academy of Art with a collection of over 400 paintings. About 50 works were by [[Italian art|Italian]] masters; some early [[Dutch art|Dutch]] paintings were also to be found there.&lt;ref name="baedeker"/&gt; At the [[King's Gate (Kaliningrad)|Königstor (King's Gate)]] stood statues of King [[Ottakar I of Bohemia]], [[Albert, Duke of Prussia|Albert of Prussia]], and [[Frederick I of Prussia]]. Königsberg had a magnificent Exchange (completed in 1875) with fine views of the harbour from the staircase. Along Bahnhofsstraße ("Station Street") were the offices of the famous Royal Amber Works – Samland was celebrated as the "[[Amber Coast]]". There was also an [[Koenigsberg Observatory|observatory]] fitted up by the astronomer [[Friedrich Bessel]], a botanical garden, and a zoological museum. The "Physikalisch", near the Heumarkt, contained botanical and anthropological collections and prehistoric antiquities. Two large theatres built during the [[Wilhelmine]] era were the Stadt (city) Theatre and the Apollo.

===Königsberg Castle===
[[File:Koenigsberg Schloss Ostseite 1900.jpg|thumb|Eastern side of Königsberg Castle, ca. 1900.]]
[[Königsberg Castle]] was one of the city's most notable structures. The former seat of the [[Grand Masters of the Teutonic Knights]] and the [[Dukes of Prussia]], it contained the [[Schlosskirche (Königsberg)|Schloßkirche]], or palace church, where [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]] was crowned in 1701 and [[William I, German Emperor|William I]] in 1861. It also contained the spacious Moscowiter-Saal, one of the largest halls in the [[German Reich]], and a museum of Prussian history.

===A center of education===
Königsberg became a centre of education when the [[University of Königsberg|Albertina University]] was founded by Duke Albert of Prussia in 1544. The university was opposite the north and east side of the [[Königsberg Cathedral]]. Lithuanian scholar [[Stanislovas Rapalionis]], one of founding fathers of the university, was the first professor of theology.&lt;ref name="zinkevi"/&gt;

===A multiethnic and multicultural metropolis===
As a consequence of the [[Protestant Reformation]], the 1525 and subsequent Prussian church orders called for providing religious literature in the languages spoken by the recipients.&lt;ref name="Bock127"/&gt; Duke Albrecht thus called in a Danzig (Gdańsk) book printer, [[Hans Weinreich]], who was soon joined by other book printers, to publish Lutheran literature not only in German and (New) Latin, but also in Latvian, Lithuanian, Old Prussian and Polish.&lt;ref name="Königsberger Buch- und Bibliotheksgeschichte"/&gt; The expected audience were inhabitants of the duchy, religious refugees, Lutherans in neighbouring Ermland (Warmia), Lithuania, and Poland as well as Lutheran priests from Poland and Lithuania called in by the duke.&lt;ref name=Bock127/&gt; Königsberg thus became a centre of printing German- and other language books:&lt;ref name="northern25"/&gt; In 1530, the first Polish translation of [[Luther's Small Catechism]] was published by Weinrich.&lt;ref name="Bock131"/&gt; In 1545, Weinreich published two Old Prussian editions of the catechism, which are the oldest printed and second-oldest books in that language after the handwritten 14th century "Elbing dictionary".&lt;ref name="Textarten im Sprachwandel. Nach der Erfindung des Buchdrucks"/&gt; The first Lithuanian-language book, ''Catechismvsa prasty szadei, makslas skaitima raschta yr giesmes'' by [[Martynas Mažvydas]], was also printed in Königsberg, published by Weinreich in 1547.&lt;ref name="Königsberger Buch- und Bibliotheksgeschichte26"/&gt; Further Polish- and Lithuanian-language religious and non-religious prints followed. One of the first [[newspaper]]s in [[Polish language]] was published in Königsberg in the years 1718-1720 ''[[Poczta Królewiecka]]''.&lt;ref name="zien"/&gt;

===Sports===

Sports clubs which played in Königsberg included [[VfB Königsberg]] and [[SV Prussia-Samland Königsberg]].  [[Lilli Henoch]], the world record holder in the [[discus]], [[shot put]], and [[4 × 100 meters relay]] events who was killed by the Nazis, was born in Königsberg,&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; as was [[Eugen Sandow]], dubbed the "father of modern bodybuilding". [[Segelclub RHE]], Germany's oldest [[sailing club]], was founded in Königsberg in 1855. The club still exists, and is now headquartered in [[Hamburg]].

===Cuisine===

[[File:Königsberger Marzipan.jpg|thumb|Königsberg-style marzipan]]
Königsberg was well-known within Germany for its unique regional cuisine. A popular dish from the city was [[Königsberger Klopse]], which is still made today in some specialist restaurants in Kaliningrad and present-day Germany.

Other food and drink native to the city included:

* [[Königsberger Marzipan]]
* [[Kopskiekelwein]], a [[wine]] made from [[blackcurrant]]s or [[redcurrant]]s
* [[Bärenfang]]
* [[Ochsenblut]], literally "ox blood", a champagne-burgundy cocktail mixed at the popular Blutgericht pub, which no longer exists

==Fortifications==
{{Main|Königsberg fortifications}}
[[File:Kaliningrad 05-2017 img30 Dohna Tower.jpg|thumb|Dohna Tower, the last to surrender after the Soviet [[Battle of Königsberg|storming of Königsberg]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="Königsberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.tourismkaliningrad.ru/attractions/museum/|title=Museums of Kaliningrad|publisher=Tourism Kaliningrad|accessdate=2011-01-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20101225150614/http://en.tourismkaliningrad.ru/attractions/museum/|archivedate=25 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[fortifications]] of Königsberg consist of numerous [[defensive walls]], forts, [[bastion]]s and other structures. They make up the First and the Second Defensive Belt, built in 1626–1634 and 1843–1859, respectively.&lt;ref name="Museum"/&gt; The 15 metre-thick First Belt was erected due to Königsberg's vulnerability during the [[Polish–Swedish wars]].&lt;ref name ="Museum"/&gt; The Second Belt was largely constructed on the place of the first one, which was in a bad condition.&lt;ref name ="Museum"/&gt; The new belt included twelve bastions, three [[ravelin]]s, seven [[spoil bank]]s and two fortresses, surrounded by water [[moat]].&lt;ref name ="Museum"/&gt; Ten brick gates served as entrances and passages through defensive lines and were equipped with [[moveable bridge]]s.&lt;ref name ="Museum"/&gt;

There was a [[Bismarck tower]] just outside Königsberg, on the Galtgarben, the highest point on the Sambian peninsula. It was built in 1906 and destroyed by German troops sometime in January 1945 [[East Prussian Offensive|as the Russians approached]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Bismarckturm]] Bismarck towers ([[German Wikipedia]])]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Galtgarben|Galtgarben (German Wikipedia)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lamberto Tassinari''' (born 1945) is a writer and editor best known for his book ''John Florio: The Man Who Was Shakespeare''. He is one of the founders of the transcultural magazine ViceVersa (not to be confused with [[Vice Versa (magazine)|a 1948 magazine of the same name]]), which he directed until its last issue in December 1996. Tassinari is one of the four writers to propose [[John Florio]] or [[Michelangelo Florio]], among those who contested the paternity of Shakespeare's work.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

'''Lipstick''' is a [[cosmetics|cosmetic product]] containing [[pigments]], [[oil]]s, [[wax]]es, and [[emollients]] that apply color, texture, and protection to the [[lip (mouth)|lips]].

Many colors and types of lipstick exist. Some lipsticks are also lip balms, to add color and hydration.

Although the name originally applied to the baton (stick) of material, within a tubular container, usually around 10mm in diameter and 50mm in length the term now generally relates to the material itself, regardless of method of application.

==History==
[[File:Red lipstick (photo by weglet).jpg|thumb|Close up of red lipstick]]
[[File:Black lipstick.jpg|thumb|Black lipstick]]

===Early history===
Ancient [[Sumer]]ian men and women were possibly the first to invent and wear lipstick, about 5,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Reading Our Lips: The History of Lipstick Regulation in Western Seats of Power |year=2006 |first=Sarah|last=Schaffer |publisher=Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard }} {{Dead link |date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They crushed [[gemstone]]s and used them to decorate their faces, mainly on the lips and around the eyes. Egyptians like Cleopatra crushed bugs to create a colour of red on their lips.&lt;ref name="lipstick3" /&gt; Women in the ancient [[Indus Valley Civilization]] may have used rectangular pieces of [[ochre]] with beveled ends as lipstick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Arts|last1=Mackay|first1=E.J.A.|volume=85|issue=4405|year=1937|title=Excavations at Chanhu-daro|page=527-545}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Egypt]]ians wore lipstick to show social status rather than gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/10018966/Schaffer06.html?sequence=2|title = The History of Lipstick Regulation in Western Seats of Power|date = May 16, 2006|access-date = Feb 8, 2016|website = Harvard.edu|publisher = Harvard|last = Schaffer|first = Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; They extracted the red dye from [[Seaweed|fucus-algin]], 0.01% [[iodine]], and some [[bromine]] mannite, but this dye resulted in serious illness. Lipsticks with shimmering effects were initially made using a [[Goniochromism|pearlescent]] substance found in fish scales.&lt;ref name="chemical1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/whatstuff/stuff/7728scit2.html|title=What's That Stuff?|publisher=Chemical and Engineering News|accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in the [[Minoan civilization]] colored their lips with bright red cosmetics. Lip paint in [[ancient Greece]] was initially restricted to prostitutes and courtesans, but expanded to the upper class between 700 and 300 BCE. Greek women colored their lips with cosmetics made from dyes containing [[Tyrian purple]], crushed [[mulberries]], and the toxic pigment [[vermilion]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Law School:[http://leda.law.harvard.edu/leda/data/788/Schaffer06.pdf Reading Our Lips: The History of Lipstick Regulation in Western Seats of Power] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905135116/http://leda.law.harvard.edu/leda/data/788/Schaffer06.pdf |date=2006-09-05 |page=4-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[China|Chinese]] made some of the first lipsticks that were made from [[beeswax]] over 1,000 years ago to protect the delicate skin of the lips. During the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907 CE), scented oils were added to them, which gave the mouth an enticing factor.

In Australia, [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] girls would paint their mouths red with [[ochre]] for puberty rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Richards, Beth|title=Blood of the Moon |journal=Herizons|date=1994|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2015}}
Lip colouring started to gain some popularity in 16th-century [[England]]. During the time of Queen [[Elizabeth I]] bright red lips and a stark white face became fashionable.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elizabethancostume.net/makeup.html Elizabethan Makeup&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, lipstick was made from a blend of [[beeswax]] and red stains from plants. Only upper class women and male actors wore makeup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elizabethan-era.org.uk/elizabethan-make-up.htm|title=Elizabethan Make-up|publisher=Elizabethanera. org.uk|accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout most of the 19th century, the obvious use of cosmetics was not considered acceptable in Britain for respectable women, and it was associated with marginalized groups such as actors and prostitutes.

By the end of the 19th century, [[Guerlain]], a French cosmetic company, began to manufacture lipstick. The first commercial lipstick had been invented in 1884, by perfumers in [[Paris, France]].

=== United States ===
In the 19th century, lipstick was colored with [[carmine]] dye. Carmine dye was extracted from [[cochineal]], scale insects native to Mexico and Central America which live on cactus plants. Cochineal insects produce carminic acid to deter predation by other insects. Carminic acid, which forms 17% to 24% of the weight of the dried insects, can be extracted from the insect's body and eggs. Mixed with aluminum or calcium salts it makes carmine dye (also known as cochineal).&lt;ref name="beautybook10" /&gt;{{rp|36}}

This lipstick did not come in a tube; it was applied with a brush. Carmine dye was expensive and the look of carmine colored lipstick was considered unnatural and theatrical, so lipstick was frowned upon for everyday wear. Only actors and actresses could get away with wearing lipstick. In 1880, few stage actresses wore lipstick in public.&lt;ref name="lipstick1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.enjoy-your-style.com/history-of-lipstick.html|title=A Brief History of Lipstick|publisher=Enjoy Your Style|accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lipstick2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://health.howstuffworks.com/skin-care/beauty/skin-and-makeup/lipstick.htm/printable|title=How Lipstick Works|publisher=Discovery Health|accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famous actress, [[Sarah Bernhardt]], began wearing lipstick and [[rouge (cosmetics)|rouge]] in public. Before the late 19th century, women only applied makeup at home. Bernhardt often applied carmine dye to her lips in public.&lt;ref name="beautybook10"&gt;{{cite book|last=Riordan|first=Theresa|authorlink = |title =Inventing Beauty: A History of the Innovations that Have Made Us Beautiful|publisher=Crown Publishing Group|date=2004-05-10|location=New York, NY|pages =36–60|url=|doi =|id = |isbn=0-7679-1451-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|36}}

In the early 1890s, carmine was mixed with an oil and wax base. The mixture gave a natural look and it was more acceptable among women. At that time, lipstick was not sold in screw up metal tube; it was sold in paper tubes, tinted papers, or in small pots.&lt;ref name="lipstick1" /&gt; The [[Sears Roebuck]] catalog first offered rouge for lips and cheeks by the late 1890s.

[[File:Lipstick (9178756966).jpg|thumb|A child with lipstick.]]
By 1912 fashionable American women had come to consider lipstick acceptable, though an article in the ''New York Times'' advised on the need to apply it cautiously.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', March 17, 1912, "The Art of Making Up":"There was a time when to confess to make up was to place one's self beyond the pale...We flaunt the vanity box these days as frankly as our ancestors did in the eighteenth century.... Touch the lips slightly with a lip-stick, but do not make your mouth look like raw beef."&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1915, lipstick was sold in cylinder metal containers, which had been invented by Maurice Levy. Women had to slide a tiny lever at the side of the tube with the edge of their fingernail to move the lipstick up to the top of the case,&lt;ref name="1920lipstick"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://beauty.about.com/cs/1920sbeauty/p/20lips.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060305002230/http://beauty.about.com/cs/1920sbeauty/p/20lips.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-03-05 |title=Clara Bow Lips – 1920s Beauty |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2010-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although lipsticks in push-up metal containers had been available in Europe since 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmetic Explosion That Started With A Lipstick|url=http://www.myartdecostyle.com/cosmetic-explosion-started-with-lipstick/|publisher=My Art Deco Style|accessdate=2014-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, the first swivel-up tube was patented by James Bruce Mason Jr. in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. As women started to wear lipstick for photographs, [[photography]] made lipstick acceptable among women.&lt;ref name="lipstick1" /&gt; [[Elizabeth Arden]] and [[Estée Lauder (person)|Estee Lauder]] began selling lipstick in their salons.&lt;ref name="lipstick2" /&gt;

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], metal lipstick tubes were replaced by plastic and paper tubes. Lipstick was scarce during that time because some of the essential ingredients of lipstick, [[petroleum]] and [[castor oil]], were unavailable.{{rp|50}} World War II allowed women to work in engineering and scientific research, and in the late 1940s, [[Hazel Bishop]], an organic chemist in New York and New Jersey, created the first long lasting lipstick, called No-Smear lipstick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berg|first=Rona|authorlink = |title =Beauty: The New Basics |publisher=Workman Publishing|date =2001-01-01|location=New York, NY|pages =144|url=|doi =|id = |isbn =978-0-7611-0186-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of Raymond Specter, an advertiser, Bishop's lipstick business thrived.

Another form of lip color, a wax-free, semi-permanent liquid formula, was invented in the 1990s by the Lip-Ink International company. Other companies have imitated the idea, putting out their own versions of long-lasting "[[lip stain]]" or "liquid lip colour."

== Lipstick trends ==
[[File:Taylor, Elizabeth posed.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Elizabeth Taylor]] helped to popularize red lipstick.]]
Throughout the early 20th century, lipstick came in a limited number of shades.

Dark red lipstick was one of the most popular shades throughout the 19th and 20th century, especially in the 1920s. [[Flappers]] wore lipstick to symbolize their independence. Lipstick was worn around the lips to form a "[[Cupid's bow]]," inspired by actress [[Clara Bow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cfa.ilstu.edu/lmlowel/THE334/1920s/1920sWomenReview.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723114722/http://www.cfa.ilstu.edu/lmlowel/THE334/1920s/1920sWomenReview.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-07-23|title=The Roaring 20s – Image Review|publisher=Illinois State University|accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, it was acceptable to apply lipstick in public and during lunch, but never at dinner.&lt;ref name="1920lipstick" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jan/17/fashion-red-lipstick-lauren-luke|title=Lipstick Follows Economy Into Red|publisher=The Guardian (U.K.)|date=2010-01-17|accessdate=2010-09-02 | location=London | first=Tracy | last=McVeigh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s, [[Elizabeth Arden]] began to introduce different lipstick colors. She inspired other companies to create a variety of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD1x2KmnX68 lipstick shades].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherrow|first=Victoria|authorlink = |title =For Appearance's Sake: The Historical Encyclopedia of Good Looks, Beauty, and Grooming|publisher=Greenwood Publishing|date=2001-03-30|location=Connecticut|pages =180|url=|doi=10.1336/1573562041 |id = |isbn =1-57356-204-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, lipstick was seen as a symbol of adult sexuality. Teenage girls believed that lipstick was a symbol of womanhood, yet adults saw it as an act of rebellion. Many Americans, especially immigrants, did not accept teenage girls wearing lipstick. A study in 1937 survey revealed that over 50% of teenage girls fought with their parents over lipstick.&lt;ref name="lipstick book" /&gt;

In the mid-1940s, several teen books and magazines stressed that men prefer a natural look over a made-up look. Books and magazines also warned girls that wearing cosmetics could ruin their chances of popularity and a career. The implication of these articles was that lipstick and rouge were for teen girls who acted very provocatively with men.&lt;ref name="lipstick book" /&gt; Despite the increased use of cosmetics, it was still associated with [[prostitution]]. Teen girls were discouraged from wearing cosmetics for fear that they would be mistaken for "loose" girls or prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forman-Brunell|first=Miriam|authorlink = |title =Girlhood in America: An Encyclopedia |publisher=ABC-CLIO|date =2001-06-01|location=Santa Barbara, California|pages =159|url=|doi =|id = |isbn =1-57607-206-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1950s, movie actresses [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Elizabeth Taylor]] helped bring back dark red lips. A 1951 survey revealed that two-thirds of teenage girls wore lipstick.

In 1950 chemist [[Hazel Bishop]] formed a company, Hazel Bishop Inc., to promote her invention of long-lasting, non-smearing 'kissproof' lipstick ("stays on you... not on him"), which quickly gained acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, December 10, 1998, obituary: 'Hazel Bishop, 92, an innovator who made lipstick kissproof'&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 1950s, a cosmetic company named Gala introduced pale shimmery lipstick. Later, [[Max Factor]] created a popular lipstick color called Strawberry Meringue. Lipstick manufacturers began creating lipsticks in [[lavender (color)|lavender]], [[pale pink]], [[white]], and [[peach (color)|peach]]. Since parents generally frowned on teen girls wearing red lipstick, some teen girls began wearing pink and peach lipsticks, which became a trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fashion-era.com/make_up_part_2.htm|title=Beauty and Make Up Fashion History After 1950|publisher=Fashion Era|accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; White or nearly white lipstick was popular in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="lipstick book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Claudia|authorlink = |author2=Jacqueline Reid-Walsh |title =Girl Culture: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Greenwood Publishing|date =2007-12-30|location=Connecticut|pages =396–397|url=|doi =10.1336/0313339082|id = |isbn =0-313-33908-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock groups such as the [[Ronettes]] and the [[Shirelles]] popularized white lipstick. Girls would apply white lipstick over pink lipstick or place under-eye concealer on their lips. During that time, many lipsticks were either matte, sheer, or slightly shiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.enjoy-your-style.com/white-lipstick.html|title=White Lipstick|publisher=Enjoy Your Style|accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, lipstick was associated with femininity. Women who did not wear lipstick were suspected of [[mental illness]] or [[lesbianism]].&lt;ref name="lipstick book" /&gt;

In the 1970s, a number of cosmetic companies introduced lipsticks in more unusual colors such as iridescent light blue ([[Kanebo]]), frosted lime green (''Conga Lime'' by [[Revlon]]), and silver sparkled navy blue (''Metallic Grandma'' by [[Biba]]). [[Make-up Art Cosmetics|M•A•C]] cosmetics continues to release limited edition and highly collectible lipsticks in a wide range of colors and finishes, including unusual hues of violets, blues, and greens.
[[File:Marilyn Manson Cannes.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Rocker [[Marilyn Manson]] helped popularize dark lipsticks in alternative subcultures.]]
Black lipstick became popular in the late 1970s and into the 1990s. In the 1950s, black lipstick had been worn by actresses starring in horror films. It became popular again due in part to [[punk subculture|punk]] and [[goth subculture|goth]] subcultures.

In the mid-1980s, so-called mood lipstick, akin to [[mood rings]], was sold to adults by mainstream cosmetic companies. This type of lipstick changes colors after it is applied, based on changes in skin's [[pH]] that supposedly reflect the wearer's mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mansour|first=David|authorlink = |title=From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|year=2005|location=Kansas City, Missouri|pages=319|url=|doi=|isbn=978-0-7407-5118-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously these had been available as little girls' play makeup. They had another resurgence in the very early 21st century, offered by inexpensive as well as more exclusive cosmetic lines, and color changing chemicals also appeared in [[lip gloss]], such as Smashbox O-Gloss, and [[Rouge (cosmetics)|blush]], such as [[Stila]] Custom Color Blush.

In the 1990s, lipstick colors became semi-matte. Shades of brown were very popular. These shades were inspired by several shows, such as "Friends". In the late 1990s and into the 21st century, pearl shades became very popular. Lipsticks were no longer matte or semi-matte, they were shiny and contained several interference pearls.

In 2012, bright bold lip colors became trendy again with saturated colors such as hot pink, neon, and orange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellasugar.com.au/2012-Critics-Choice-Awards-Beauty-Trend-Bold-Lipstick-21301625|title=2012 Critics' Choice Awards Beauty Trend: Bold Lipstick|first=Sarah|last=Macrae|work=POPSUGAR Beauty Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 and early 2015 nude lipsticks were coming up to be incredibly popular. These lipsticks follow the general trend where "less is more". Examples of celebrities promoting this trend are [[Paris Hilton]] and [[Gigi Gorgeous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestnudelipstick.com |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150416170024/http://www.bestnudelipstick.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-04-16 |title=Best Nude Lipstick |work=bestnudelipstick.com |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015 and 2016 liquid lipstick, which applies like a gloss but dries matte, became popularized with brands such as [[Anastasia Beverly Hills]]. Its most common form comes in a tube, applied with an applicator wand.

Lipstick also has many variations including [[lip balm|lip balms]], glosses, crayons, pencils, liners, and stains. Balms and glosses tend to be more translucent and not as dark or vibrant. Some individuals opt to buying lip balms and glosses over lipstick, as they get a more hydrating feeling from it.

A lipstick lesbian is a female who is typically attracted to other females, but she still remains feminine and has a “girly” identity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} The term lipstick lesbian became popular when used by writer Deborah Bergman, a reporter for The Los Angeles Times. While running the LA Times, she created Lesbian News. “The Lesbian News was in good part responsible for popularizing the ‘lipstick lesbian’ who had been born in L.A. and has more recently been made famous worldwide through the television series, The L Word” (Faderman 275).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gay L.A.: A History of Sexual Outlaws, Power Politics,  and Lipstick Lesbians.|last=Faderman, Lillian|first=Simmons, Stuart|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ingredients ==
Lipstick contains wax, oils, antioxidants, and emollients.&lt;ref&gt;Günther Schneider, Sven Gohla, Jörg Schreiber, Waltraud Kaden, Uwe Schönrock, Hartmut Schmidt-Lewerkühne, Annegret Kuschel, Xenia Petsitis, Wolfgang Pape, Hellmut Ippen and Walter Diembeck "Skin Cosmetics" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a24_219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wax provides the structure to the solid lipstick.  Lipsticks may be made from several waxes such as [[beeswax]], [[ozokerite]] and [[candelilla wax]]. Because of its high [[melting point]], [[carnauba wax]] is a key ingredient in terms of strengthening the lipstick. Various oils and fats are used in lipsticks, such as [[olive oil]], [[mineral oil]], [[cocoa butter]], [[lanolin]], and [[petrolatum]].

Lead and other trace metals are also found in many lipsticks.  It is impossible to know whether these metals are in the lipstick by looking at the ingredient list because they are not an intentional ingredient added, but rather, an unintentional contaminant.  These trace metals are naturally occurring and accidentally get taken up with other chemicals that are used in lipstick production.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Saleh|first=Iman|last2=Al-Enazi|first2=Sami|date=2011-07-01|title=Trace metals in lipsticks|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02772248.2011.582040|journal=Toxicological &amp; Environmental Chemistry|volume=93|issue=6|pages=1149–1165|doi=10.1080/02772248.2011.582040|issn=0277-2248}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Lead and other trace metals will not be listed in the ingredients section of different lipsticks.  Look for lead acetate, chromium, thimerosal, hydrogenated cottonseed oil, sodium hexametaphosphate on the ingredients list of lipsticks.  These chemicals contain trace amounts of naturally occurring metals, such as lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/lead-and-other-heavy-metals/|title=Lead And Other Heavy Metals - Safe Cosmetics|newspaper=Safe Cosmetics|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lipsticks get their colors from a variety of [[pigment]]s and lake dyes including, but not limited to bromo acid, D&amp;C Red No. 21, Calcium Lake such as D&amp;C Red 7 and D&amp;C Red 34, and D&amp;C Orange No. 17. Pink lipsticks are made by mixing white [[titanium dioxide]] and red shades. Both organic and inorganic pigments are employed.

Matte lipsticks contain more filling agents like [[silica]] but do not have many emollients. Creme lipsticks contain more waxes than oils. Sheer and long lasting lipsticks contain more oil, while long lasting lipsticks also contain [[silicone oil]], which seals the colors to the wearer's lips. Glossy lipstick contains more oil to give a shiny finish to the lips.

Shimmery or frost lipstick may contain [[mica]], [[silica]], and synthetic [[pearl]] particles, such as [[bismuth oxychloride]], to give them a glittery or shimmering shine.&lt;ref name="chemical1" /&gt;

Lipstick is made from grinding and heating ingredients. Then heated waxes are added to the mix for texture. Oils and lanolin are added for specific formula requirements. Afterwards, the hot liquid is poured into a metal mold. The mixture is then chilled. Once they have hardened, they are heated in flame for half a second to create a shiny finish and to remove imperfections.&lt;ref name="chemical1" /&gt;

== Lead traces ==
In 2007, a study by the [http://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/regulations/us-laws/lead-in-lipstick/ Campaign for Safe Cosmetics] released a report called [http://www.womensvoices.org/poison-kiss/ A Poison Kiss] that tested 33 popular brands of lipstick for its lead content.

In 2010, the FDA conducted an [http://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/productsingredients/products/ucm137224.htm#expanalyses expanded survey] on its previous study, which broadened the testing to 400 lipsticks that were available on the U.S. market at the time.  This study was done by Frontier Global Sciences, Inc. using the same testing method as 2009.  This study found an average of 1.11 ppm compared to the 1.07 ppm average in the 2009 study.  The maximum lead level found was 7.19 ppm in Maybelline’s Color Sensational 125 – Pink Petal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;   This is over two times the maximum limit found in the 2009 study.

Lead is not listed as an ingredient in lipstick, but trace amounts can be found in the mineral based additives.  Lead is naturally occurring in soil, water, and air.  This means that lead can find its way into the raw ingredients used in lipstick color additives.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics made a list of [http://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/lead-and-other-heavy-metals/ chemicals for concern] which can contain toxic chemicals such as lead.

While only trace amounts of lead are ingested from lipstick, lead accumulates in the body, which can lead to [[lead poisoning]].  The most common users of lipstick are teens and adult women.  A study done by the University of California – Berkley found that women applied lipstick anywhere from two to fourteen times a day.  This translates to up to 87 milligrams of product ingestion per day.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Lead ingestion is particularly concerning for pregnant women because lead can enter the fetus from the mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gondal, M.

Lipstick, as a physical evidence, may be found on [[clothing]], parts of the victim's or convict's body, a [[Facial tissue|tissue]], a [[cigarette]], etc. By comparing the composition of a lipstick smear with that of a victim or a witness, [[forensic science|forensic scientists]] can demonstrate direct or indirect proof of contact or a relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. Also, it is sometimes possible to extract [[saliva]] [[DNA]] from the lipstick print which might link a suspect to their presence at the [[crime scene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hartnell College Technical Note|url=http://www.hartnell.edu/sites/default/files/u276/lipcosmeticsdna.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various other methods of forensic lipstick analysis are used. For instance, a small amount of lipstick (approximately 10 μg) could lead to good comparisons in [[Thin Layer Chromatography]].

The '''Maimonidean Controversy'''  is the series of ongoing disputes between so called “philosophers” and so called “traditionalists”.  The principle part of the controversy took place in the thirteenth and fourteenth century,   but the questions raised have remained unresolved until today.  The debates initially centered around [[Maimonides]]’ writings after they had been made accessible to [[Jews in France|French rabbinic scholars]] by translation to [[Hebrew]] from [[Judeo-Arabic]] and stood in direct relation to Maimonides’ project of mediating Jewish tradition and [[Arabic Philosophy|Greco-Arabic philosophy and science]]. However, characters within the controversy can often not be clearly ascribed to one camp (“philosophy” or “tradition”), these are simplified and polemic categories, used in the literature contemporary to the controversy itself.

==The four phases of the controversy==

No other Jewish philosophical writings have produced such controversy as Maimonides’ [[Moreh Nevuchim|''More Nevuchim'']]. The Maimonidean Controversy is in secondary [[historiographic]] [[literature]] often divided into four phases where heated debate was not infrequently joined with reciprocal bans.

===First Stage: 1180-1204===

Already in the last years of Maimonides’ life a controversy erupted based on theological grounds when he critiqued the institution of exile Judaism within which geonim (rabbinic scholars), found a comfortable living through stipends or donations. Maimonides’ view was that they – like himself – should work in a second occupation to stustain themselves. This fell into a time when [[Shmuel ben Ali]] tried to minimize the [[Exilarch]]’s power for the benefit of the [[geonim]]. In addition to his institutional critique, in the introduction to his [[Mishne Torah]] Maimonides suggested that this work would make the employment of rabbinic scholars redundant. At this stage, even though some philosophical issues were discussed, mainly Maimonides’ revolutionary view on [[Talmud]] scholarship and Jewish leadership.

===First Stage in Europe===

The main subject of the controversy in Europe had been the [[Mishneh Torah|''Mishne Torah'']], as it had been written in Hebrew. His previous works had been produced in Arabic, and so were inaccessible to European scholars who were largely ignorant of Arabic. The controversy heated up, when most of Maimonides’ works had been translated to Hebrew, most notably his ''More Nevuchim'' in 1204 by [[Ibn Tibbon|Shmuel Ibn Tibbon]]. Maimonides’ works had in the Jewish scholarship immersed in Arab philosophy been hardly surprising, critique was mostly limited to his social criticism and his unconventional methodology. When his works reached Christian [[Europe]], however, they fell on largely traditional ground, in the sense that scholarship (neither Jewish nor [[Christian]]) had been largely unexposed to science or philosophy.

Maimonides didn’t provide any citations in his Mishne Torah, for which he was mainly criticized by the French [[Abraham ben David of Posquières|RaBaD]], Abraham Ben David of Posquières. His critical gloss ([[hasagah]]) to his introduction is since the 16th century included in the editions of the Mishne Torah. He also articulates a theoretical critique of Maimonides’ declaration of corporealist beliefs as heresy. Although it is never really clear whether Maimonides actually denies bodily resurrection, he is accused as such by RaBaD.

[[Meir ben Todros HaLevi Abulafia|RaMaH]], Rabbi Meir ben Todros HaLevi Abulafia, was initially an admirer of Maimonides. When he found, however, about charges against Maimonides being in denial of resurrection, he responded furiously and disappointedly. But when he saw Maimonides’ ambiguously apologetic ''[[Treatise on Resurrection]]'' (Maqalah fi Teḥiyat ha-Metim, 1190–91), published in response to the charges, he was calmed, convinced that Maimonides actually did believe in the bodily resurrection. After Maimonides’ death 1204, the controversy simmered down.

===Second Stage: 1230-1235===

Because of the aforementioned strangeness, with which the European scholars encountered Maimonides’ work, the locus of the second heating up of the controversy was Southern France. In addition, while initially Maimonides himself had been the object of controversy, in the second stage Maimonides’ work was only the platform on which the general conflict between philosophy and tradition could be contested. Maimonides’ work fell into a time of ideological formation of a Christian Europe, with the [[Crusades]] and the Spanish [[Reconquista]]. Mystical tendencies and [[kabbalah|kabbalistic]] circles were on the rise in Spain, philosophy had enjoyed a great flourishing also of Jewish authors under Muslim rule in [[Sepharad|al-Andalús]]. Maimonides’ projects to combine Jewish tradition with Greco-Arabic [[Aristotelianism]] – a problem already in the Talmud addressed as “Greek wisdom” (hokhmah yevanit).

Wolfson generalizes this to be an issue common to [[Latin]], Arabic and Jewish traditions who all attempted “[[Philo of Alexandria|Philonic]]” structures to combine reason with revelation.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, Philo: Foundations of Religious Philosophy in Judaism, Christianity and Islam (1947)&lt;/ref&gt; Between Philo and Maimonides stood for instance [[Ibn Daud]] or [[Saadia Gaon|Sa’adia Ga’on]] to attempt such a synthesis. Hence, what was new and provocative was not the intellectual project, but the European context in which it fell: with the [[conquest of Constantinople|fall of Constantinople]], Greek texts in their original became accessible to Christian scholars, posing a threat to the dogmatic faith, as the spreading universities did to [[monasteries]] as the monopolies of scholarship. While the church was involved on fronts against [[Catharism|Cathari]] and [[Albigenses|Albigense]] heresies, both anti-Maimonidean Rabbis and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Inquisition|inquisitors]] were quick to draw connections between those [[Albigensian Crusade|belligerents]] of the church and Maimonides’ thought.

On basis of theological (as denying miracles, regarding prophecy as purely natural, all undermining the authority of the text), exegetical (allegorization, denying historicity) and practical (suspected laxity in observance) arguments did the Rabbis of northern France issue a ban against Maimonides’ More Nevuchim and Sefer HaMada (the introduction to his Mishne Tora that contained philosophical readings) in 1232, lead by the *Nachmanideans *Yonah ben Abraham Gerondi and *Meshullam da Piera. Letters exchanged between [[David Kimchi]] and [[Yuda Alfakhar]] are preserved in [[Iggeroth Qena’oth]], it was suggested by S. Harvey that this served as model for [[Ibn Falaquera]]’s Epistle of Debate. Falaquera was participant in the third stage.

When, however, in 1232 Maimonides’ books were confiscated and burnt by Dominicans (although there are stories about this being initiated by anti-Maimonideans who brought the books to the attention of the authorities, the historical situation is more than unclear), the Jewish communities of the Provence, northern France and northern Spain were shocked and buried their belligerencies. [[Abraham ben Moses ben Maimon]], Maimonides’ son, is equally outraged when he hears of the accusations brought against his father in Europe. The desecration of Maimonides’ tomb and the burning of Talmudic literature in the 1240s in Paris set the debates aside for a few decades.&lt;ref&gt;D.J. Silver, Maimonidean Criticism and the Maimonidean Controversy, 1180–1240 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third Stage: 1288-1290===

The third stage is far less significant and involved a far lesser scope. It is, however, indicative for the diverging contexts of Christian Europe and Muslim-ruled North Africa and Middle East. [[Solomon Petit|Shlomo Petit]] had immigrated to Palestine in 1288 and taught Kabbalah in Acre where he continued agitating against Maimonides’ thought. He found himself, however, in an environment long accustomed to science and philosophy (other than his native Christian Europe), and earned not only ridicule playing on his name (peti-fool) but was also banned 4 times. He also seemed to have forgotten that he fell under the Egyptian [[nagid]]’s jurisdiction, who happened to be Maimonides’ grandson. Also Ibn Falaquera in Europe sends letters of opposition.&lt;ref&gt;J. Sarachek, Faith and Reason: the Conflict over the Rationalism of Maimonides (1935).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth Stage: 1300-1306===

In this last controversy, the entry of philosophy into tradition was not debated anymore – Maimonidean ideas had found support even amongst the traditionalists who now sought to limit the study of philosophical works at the expense of traditional scholarship. Kabbalistic practices and esoteric exegesis had become commonplace amongst the “philosophers”, on basis of which (especially astral magic – which, ironically, had been denied reality by the RaMbaM) they were accused for idolatry.

[[Abba Mari Astruc|Abba Mari Astruc HaYarḥi]] of Lunel approached [[Solomon Ben Abraham Adret|RaShbA]] (Rabbi Shlomo b. Abraham Adret) of Barcelona because he saw the philosopher’s allegorical interpretations and subsidizing of the Torah’s authority with Aristotle. RaShbA himself, however, had engaged in astral magic earlier in his life, and denied that it was in any way offensive to halakha. Nonetheless, in 1305 he issued a local ban against extreme allegory and the study of philosophy under the age of 25. The bone of content thus shifted to the age under which it was not permitted because possibly harmful to study philosophy.

[[Menachem ben Shlomo Meiri]] and [[Yedaiah ben Abraham Bedershi HaPnini]], Astruc’s main opponents, rejected these charges, as well as accusations for lax observance. [[Yaacov ben Abba Mari Anatoli|Ya‘akov b. Abba Mari Anatoli]] (1194–1296), however, in his Malmad HaTalmidim did draw heavily on [[allegorical interpretation]], including cosmological readings of Torah passages, ‘in the manner of the Christians’, as his opponents were quick to accuse him of.

Menachem ben Shlomo Meiri issued a counter-ban against Astruc, emphasizing that philosophy and “Greek wisdom” was as important as the study of the Torah, as long as they went hand in hand. HaPnini followed suit with a Letter of Apology (Kitav Hitnatslut), a sharp attack against the “traditionalists”. After this, the last stage of the controversy faded out, and found a shocking end in the [[Jews in France|expulsion of the Jews from France]] in 1306.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Sasson, Haim Hillel, et al. "Maimonidean Controversy." Encyclopaedia Judaica, edited by Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik, 2nd ed., vol. 13, Macmillan Reference USA, 2007, pp. 371-381.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aftermath ===
Even now, the Maimonidean project is not concluded, the question about the possibility or impossibility to combine Jewish tradition and science/philosophy was never resolved. For example, in the 16th century, [[Moshe Isserles]] defended philosophy against [[Solomon ben Jehiel Luria|Shlomo ben Yehiel Luria]]. While this continues to be debated (as it does in Christian, Muslim or secular cultures), Maimonides is today counted among the greatest of Jewish tradition. In fact, most opponents to philosophy made apologetically sure, that they could not be misunderstood in violating the authority of Maimonides.

==Life==
He was born in Sagawa town, [[Takaoka District, Kōchi|Takaoka]] gun, [[Kōchi Prefecture]] on 11 May 1872. After graduation from [[Tokyo Imperial University]] in 1900, he became professor at private Kumamoto Medical School in 1901. In 1909 and 1910, he studied in München and [[Bonn]] universities. He was appointed the president of Aichi Medical School in 1916. In 1925, he was appointed the president of Kumamoto Medical College and director of the Hospital. In 1929, he wrote ''The history of medical education in Higo (Kumamoto).'' In 1932, he retired from the Kumamoto Medical College. In 1932 and 1933, he travelled in Okinawa and on 29 May 1950 he died in his house.

==Okinawa==
Originally interested in history and travelling, he retired at age 60 from the university and travelled to Okinawa in 1932 and 1933. In 1932, a cameraman accompanied him and in 1933 he was accompanied by his wife, son, a cameraman and an artist. Many physicians who studied in his universities helped him (he used the Governor's car). Fortunately,  photographs of various scenes taken during his journey in Okinawa in 1932 and 1933, mostly in historical spots, were discovered and published in 2000. Since Okinawa was hit badly by the last war, these photographs were considered of inestimable value. The inclusion of himself in photographs served as a measure of various buildings.

==Medical education in Higo (Kumamoto)==
His famous book, ''Medical education in Higo'' dates back to 1758 when Saishunkan was established. This book has more than 800 pages.

==Yokoi Shōnan==
He studied [[Yokoi Shōnan]] and his book got a renewed interest. 2009 marked the 200th year after the birth of [[Yokoi Shōnan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Yokoi Shōnan]] (1938). Masatada Yamasaki Meiji Shoin&lt;/ref&gt; This book has more than 1300 pages.

**''A Moemorial Lecture'' by Dr. M. Yamasaki
***(Beginning) Motoda Toya (1801-1880), Yokoi Shōnan's devoted disciple and friend, exalted him as an unrivalled master of moral philosophy and a schlar suitable to be an Emperor's instructor, and adds, ''"I have made friends with many persons of repute in my life, but really can I remamber none with so broad a view and so highspirited as Yokoi, my instructor.  His clear judgement and keen observation can hardly be attained by others"''. Nagaoka Moriyoshi(1842-1906), one of his bosom friends, wrote a sonnet in praise of Yokoi in which he says, ''"Who on earth would dare to compete with him for gift and talent ?"''
***Katsu Kaishu(1823-1899), known to have had a very high opinion of his own wit and discernment, had to confess that Yokoi was surprisingly broadminded and towered above his contemporaries. He says, ''"During the eventful years of my life, I have come across two really formidable persons to deal with, namely, Saigo Nanshu''(1827-1877) ''and Yokoi Shonan. Well, Yokoi's knowledge of the world affairs was by no means rich, so I had been very often his teacher in that respect. On the other hand, his hightoned thinking and imagination was far beyond my reach."''

Okumiya graduated from the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy]] in 1930 as a midshipman. He was commissioned an ensign in April 1932, received his wings in November 1933 as a naval aviator, and was promoted to sub-lieutenant in the same month. He entered the Naval Air Corps at Omura, receiving promotion to lieutenant in December 1936. In 1937, he participated in the [[Panay incident|attack on the USS ''Panay'']].&lt;ref&gt;Peter B. Mersky.

Page 94&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to lieutenant-commander in October 1941, Okumiya served throughout [[World War II]], including on the [[Japanese aircraft carrier Ryūjō|aircraft carrier ''Ryūjō'']] and with the [[2nd Air Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy]]. During 1942–1943, he served as chief of staff of the 26th Naval Air Squadron, and was appointed to a staff post in August 1944.  He was promoted to his final rank of [[commander]] in November 1944. At the end of the war, Okumiya was interrogated by Allied intelligence officers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww2db.com/doc.php?q=121 Transcripts of Okumiya interrogation documents]. World War II Database&lt;/ref&gt; after which he was demobilised.

Following the [[occupation of Japan]], he joined the nascent [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]] in 1954. He returned to active duty in July 1957 with the rank of colonel, and was appointed commander of the air base at Utsunomiya.  He was promoted to major general in February 1958 and served as deputy head of Personnel and Training from August 1959 to April 1960. He commanded the 3rd Air Wing from Komaki Air Base in 1961, followed by command of the Ichigaya Air Base in 1962. He was promoted to lieutenant-general in 1963 and ended his career as commander of the ATC and Meteorological Group. He retired the following year.

Okumiya wrote extensively on Japan's role in [[World War II]]. He co-wrote with Mitsuo Fuchida ''Midway: The Battle that Doomed Japan; the Japanese Navy's Story'', published 1955. He also co-wrote, with Jiro Horikoshi and Martin Caidin, an historical account of the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]], titled ''Zero!'' The book was published in 1956.

'''Milton Osborne''' is an Australian [[historian]], author, and consultant specializing in [[Southeast Asia]].

He attended North Sydney Boys' High School, graduated from the [[University of Sydney]] and received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from [[Cornell University]]. Osborne held academic positions in Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Singapore. Osborne's main historical contribution had been to synthesize the history of the region as a whole, rather than concentrate on the histories of the present-day nations.

His Southeast Asia association began in 1959 with an Australian diplomatic posting to [[Phnom Penh]]. In 1980 and 1981 Osborne advised the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] on the Cambodian refugee problem. In 1982 he returned to Australia, working as Head of the Asia Branch of the [[Office of National Assessments]], also serving for a year as Head of Current Intelligence.

Osborne now lives in Sydney and continues to write while consulting on Asian issues, as well as having been a series editor on the ''Short History of Asia Series'' published by Allen and Unwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Curtis Andressen | author2= Milton Osborne (Editor) | title=A Short History of Japan From Samurai to Sony (Short History of Asia series, A)Paperback | publication-date=2003 | publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin | isbn=978-1-86508-516-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
After studying in [[Paris]] with masters like [[Fernand Braudel]], Le Roy Ladurie, and especially [[Louis Aragon]] and [[Elsa Triolet]], with whom he became friends he continued an academic career in Switzerland after earning his doctorate in letters to University of Lausanne. Thus he became from 1980 to 1992 professor at the Graduate Institute of European Studies in Geneva, founded in 1963 by [[Denis de Rougemont]], associate professor at the University of Neuchatel, and a professor at the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] from 1992 to his death.

His main topics of research in the humanities were European integration, the problem of East-West relations and the role of Switzerland in the chessboard of the world and its relations and interactions with him.

As he himself said in an interview with Swiss television, his cosmopolitan origins predisposed to this type of education and openness to the world, he says: "''I am a very complicated Switzerland to tell the truth [...] and also to add to the complication, my mother is of Dutch origin, the mother of my father was Belgian and my father was born in Germany, Switzerland I am a true and a true European'' "

==Pierre du Bois Foundation for Contemporary History==
At his death, his widow Irina du Bois de Dunilac created, according to the wishes of her late husband, the "Foundation Pierre du Bois" whose purpose is to stimulate and support research on the history of the present time, European and global. This foundation is especially available a scholarship to encourage and support a doctoral dissertation in the field of history of our time.

On Monday, December 8, 2008, Mr. [[Pascal Couchepin]], President of the [[Swiss Confederation]] has launched the Foundation at the Institute of International Studies and Development.

On this occasion, Pascal Couchepin spoke about "''the politician and the news''". He remembered Pierre du Bois and the friendship that bound them for almost half a century, highlighting its culture and elegance, and his love for discussion and to discover new things.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10568">[[File:Vakhtang-Almaskhan, Prince of Georgia 02.jpg|thumb|Vakhtang-Almaskhan, Prince of Georgia]]
'''Vakhtang''' ({{lang-ka|ვახტანგი}}) also known as '''Almaskhan''' (ალმასხანი) (22 June 1761 – 28 October 1814) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] prince royal (''[[batonishvili]]'') of the [[Bagrationi dynasty]], born to King [[Heraclius II of Georgia|Heraclius II]] and Queen [[Darejan Dadiani]]. He distinguished himself in the war with [[Iran]] in 1795 and was then active in opposition to his half-brother [[George XII of Georgia]] and the newly established [[Russian Empire|Russian]] administration in Georgia. In 1802 he surrendered to the Russian authorities and spent the rest of his life in [[St. Petersburg]], working on an overview of Georgia's history. In Russia he was known as the ''[[tsarevich]]'' Vakhtang Irakliyevich [[Gruzinsky]] ({{lang-ru|Вахтанг Ираклиевич Грузинский}}).

==Prince Royal==
Vakhtang was born in 1761 into the family of Heraclius II, King of [[Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakheti]] (and of [[Kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti|Kartli]] after 1762), and his third wife Darejan née Princess [[Dadiani]]. He was a namesake of his late half-brother, [[Vakhtang, son of Heraclius II of Georgia|Vakhtang]] (died in 1756), and also bore the second name, Almaskhan. After the death of his brother [[Levan, son of Heraclius II of Georgia|Levan]] in 1781, Vakhtang succeeded him to the princely [[appanage]] in the mountainous [[Duchy of Aragvi|Aragvi valley]], for which he codified the criminal and family law (განჩინება ბარისა და მთიურთა ადგილთა, ''The Regulations for the Lowlands and Highlands'') in 1782. In September 1795, Vakhtang fought in his father's ranks against the invading Iranian army of [[Agha Muhammad Khan]] at the [[battle of Krtsanisi]] in the course of which he commanded the last stand of [[Three Hundred Aragvians|his highlanders]] on the approaches of [[Tbilisi]].{{sfn|Megrelidze|1979|p=337}}{{sfn|Kikodze|1945|p=72}}

==Civil unrest==
After the death of Heraclius in 1798, Vakhtang joined his mother Queen Dowager Darejan and brothers, [[Iulon, son of Heraclius II of Georgia|Iulon]], [[Parnaoz, son of Heraclius II of Georgia|Parnaoz]], and [[Alexander, son of Heraclius II of Georgia|Alexander]], in opposition to his half-brother, King [[George XII of Georgia|George XII]]. The crisis was occasioned by George's renegation on the 1791 testament of Heraclius, requiring the king's successor to pass the throne not to his offspring, but to his eldest brother, thereby making Vakhtang the third in the line of succession, behind George and Iulon. George XII renewed Heraclius's quest for [[Russian Empire|Russian]] protection and obtained from [[Tsar of Russia|Tsar]] [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] recognition of his son, [[David, son of George XII of Georgia|David]], as heir-apparent on 18 April 1799.{{sfn|Lang|1957|p=230}}

By July 1800, the kingdom faced the prospect of imminent civil war as the rival factions mobilized their loyal forces. Iulon, Vakhtang, and Parnaoz blocked the roads to Tbilisi and attempted to rescue their mother, Queen Dowager Darejan, who had been forced by George XII into confinement at her own palace in [[Avlabari]]. The arrival of additional Russian troops under Major-General Vasily Gulyakov in September 1800 in Tbilisi made George XII's position relatively secure, but after his death in December 1800 the Russians prevented his heir David from acceding to the throne and went ahead with the outright annexation of Georgia to the Russian Empire. Vakhtang, who had by that time retired to his residence in [[Dusheti]], in the Aragvi valley, was suspected by the Russians of being responsible of sabotaging the Russian communications and being in touch with his rebellious brother Alexander, who had staged, with his [[Avar Khanate|Avar]] allies, an abortive invasion of the eastern Georgian province of [[Kakheti]] in November 1800.{{sfn|Gvosdev|2000|p=81}}

==Arrest and exile==
[[File:Vakhtang Iraklievich and Darya Georgievna of Georgia's grave in Blagoveschenskaya church 02 by shakko.JPG|thumb|Prince Vakhtang's grave in the Blagovecshenskaya church of Alexander Nevsky Lavra.]]
In July 1802, when the anti-Russian opposition became more vocal in Georgia, the Russians attempted to lure Vakhtang out of Dusheti. Vakhtang escaped from his castle to the mountains of [[Mtiuleti]], but, when the Caucasian Grenadier Regiment under the command of Major-General Sergei Tuchkov advanced into the area, he surrendered on 10 August 1802 to avoid bloodshed. He was brought to Tbilisi and placed under house arrest together with his mother Darejan at the palace of Avlabari.{{sfn|Tuchkov|1808|p=196}} On 19 February 1803, Vakhtang and his former foe, David, son of George XII, departed under the Russian military escort to St. Petersburg, where he died in 1814 and was interred at the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]].{{sfn|Megrelidze|1979|p=337}} The epitaph in Georgian, commissioned by Vakhtang's widow, laments his having died in a foreign land, not being able to see the motherland.{{sfn|Brosset|1840|pp=498–500}}

During the years in St. Petersburg, Prince Vakhtang wrote on the history and politics of his home country.{{sfn|Megrelidze|1979|p=337}} His reflections on the social and political issues in Georgia were translated by a Georgian, Igor Chilayev, into Russian and published as Письма царевича Вахтанга Ираклиевича (''The Letters of Prince Royal Vakhtang, son of Heraclius'') in St. Petersburg in 1812. Vakhtang also authored Обозрение истории грузинскаго народа (''Overview of the History of the Georgian Nation''), published in St. Petersburg in 1814. A portion of it, translated by the German scholar [[Julius Klaproth]], was published in English as "Sketch of the History of Georgia" in ''The Asiatic Journal'' in 1831.{{sfn|Vakhtang|1831|pp=228–238}}

==Family==
Vakhtang was married twice. The identity of his first wife, of the [[Tsulukidze]] princely family, is not known. He married secondly, in 1784, Princess Mariam (1769 – 27 September 1837), daughter of Prince David Andronikashvili and the Dame of the [[Order of Saint Catherine|Imperial Order of Saint Catherine]] (1810). He had no children.{{sfn|Montgomery|1980|p=66}}

'''Rebracketing''' (also known as '''resegmentation''' or '''metanalysis''') is a process in [[historical linguistics]] where a word originally derived from one source is broken down or bracketed into a different set of factors. It is a form of [[folk etymology]], where the new factors may appear meaningful (e.g. ''[[hamburger]]'' taken to mean a ''burger'' with ''ham''), or may seem to be the result of valid [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] processes.

Rebracketing often focuses on highly probable word boundaries: "a noodle" might become "an oodle", since "an oodle" sounds just as grammatically correct as "a noodle", and likewise "an eagle" might become "a neagle", but "the bowl" would not become "th ebowl" and "a kite" would not become "ak ite".

Technically, bracketing is the process of breaking an utterance into its constituent parts. The term is akin to [[parsing]] for larger sentences, but it is normally restricted to morphological processes at the sublexical level, i.e. within the particular word or [[lexeme]]. For example, the word ''uneventful'' is conventionally bracketed as &lt;nowiki&gt;[un+[event+ful]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and the bracketing &lt;nowiki&gt;[[un+event]+ful]&lt;/nowiki&gt; leads to completely different [[semantics]]. Re-bracketing is the process of seeing the same word as a different morphological decomposition, especially where the new [[etymology]] becomes the conventional norm. The name '''false splitting''', also called '''misdivision''', in particular is often reserved for the case where two words mix but still remain two words (as in the "noodle" and "eagle" examples above).

The name '''juncture loss''' may be specially deployed to refer to the case of an article and a noun fusing (such as if "the jar" were to become "(the) thejar" or "an apple" were to become "(an) anapple"). Loss of [[juncture]] is especially common in the cases of [[loanword]]s and loan phrases in which the recipient language's speakers at the time of the word's introduction did not realize an article to be already present (e.g. numerous Arabic-derived words beginning 'al-' ('the'), including "algorithm", "alcohol", "alchemy", etc.). Especially in the case of loan phrases, juncture loss may be recognized as substandard even when widespread (e.g. "the ''hoi polloi''", where Greek ''hoi'' = "the", and "the [[Magna Carta]]", in which no article is necessary because ''magna carta'' is borrowed rather than [[calque]]d, Latin's lack of articles makes the original term either implicitly definite or indeterminate with respect to definiteness [in this context, the former], and the English phrase's proper-noun status renders unnecessary any further determination through the use of an article).

As a statistical change within a language within any century, rebracketing is a very weak statistical phenomenon. Even during phonetic template shifts, it is at best only probable that 0.1% of the vocabulary may be rebracketed in any given century.

Rebracketing is part of the process of [[language change]], and often operates together with [[sound change]]s that facilitate the new etymology. 

Rebracketing is sometimes used for jocular purposes, for example ''psychotherapist'' can be rebracketed jocularly as ''Psycho the rapist'', and ''together in trouble'' can be rebracketed jocularly as ''to get her in trouble''.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 146 in [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2003), [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]]. [[Palgrave Macmillan]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in forming new words==

In [[English language|English]], the word adder derives from the [[Old English]] ''næddre'', snake, re-bracketed from "a nædder" to "an adder" (c. 14th century); the word "nedder" for snake is still present in some Northern English dialects. Similarly, "nickname" is a refactorization of "an ekename" (1303, ''ekename'' = additional, little name).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apron is thought to have been derived from the rebracketing of 'Napron' in the 15th century.

Ned or Neddy may have risen from generations of children hearing "mine Ed" as "my Ned" (''mīn'' is the [[Middle English]] form of the [[grammatical person|first person]] [[possessive pronoun]], and the ''my'' form was also emerging around the same time). Similarly "mine Ellie" → "my Nellie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

As another example, ''alone'' has its etymology in ''all''+''one'' (cognate to [[German language|German]] ''allein''). It was subsequently rebracketed as a+lone (akin to aflutter, afire), so the second part seemed likely to be a word, "lone".

==Examples==

* The word [[hamburger]]'s origins were in a form of ground meat dish originating from [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]] (where it is still called [[Steak tartare|Tartar steak]]). A possible bracketing for the original may be ''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[ham+burg]+er]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', but after its introduction into the [[United States]], it was soon factorized as ''[ham+burger]'' (helped by ''ham'' being a form of meat). This led to the independent suffix ''-burger'': chickenburger, fishburger, etc. In the original etymology, ''burg'' was town and ''burger'' was a resident, or something related to the town; after refactorization it becomes a chunk of meat for a sandwich, although a hamburger does not contain ham.&lt;ref&gt;

* The English word ''outrage'' is a [[loanword]] from French, where it was formed by combining the adverb ''[[:wikt:outre#French|outre]]'' (meaning "beyond") with the suffix ''[[:wikt:-age#French|-age]]''; thus, the original literal meaning is "beyondness" – that is, beyond what is acceptable. The rebracketing as a compound of ''out-'' with the noun or verb ''rage'' has led to both a different pronunciation than the one to be expected for such a loanword (compare ''umbrage'') and an additional meaning of "angry reaction" not present in French.
* The English ''helico•pter'' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''heliko-'' and ''pterōn'') has been rebracketed to modern ''heli•copter'' (as in [[jetcopter]], [[heliport]]).
* ''cybern•etics'': (from Greek ''kubernān'' and ''-ētēs'') has become modern ''cyber•netics'' (as in [[cyberspace]]).
* [[prosthodontics]] (= [[false teeth]]) is from ''prosth(o)''- + Greek ''odont''-; ''odont''- = "[[tooth]]", and ''prostho''- arose by misdivision of "[[prosthetic]]", which was treated as supposed stem ''prosth-'' and suffix ''-etic'', but actually came from Greek ''pros'' = "in front of" and ''thē-'' (the [[root (linguistics)|root]] of the verb ''tithēmi'' = "I place").
* The dog breed [[labradoodle|"labrad•oodle"]] (a cross between a [[Labrador Retriever]] and [[Poodle]]) has been rebracketed to "labra•doodle" leading to the "doodle" suffix in other poodle crossbreeds such as the [[goldendoodle]] and Aussiedoodle.
* The word ''[[alcoholism|alco•holic]]'' derives from ''[[alcohol]]'' (itself a junctureless rebracketing of Arabic ''al-kuḥl'') and ''ic''. Words for other addictions have formed by treating ''holic'' as a suffix: ''[[workaholic]]'', ''chocoholic'', etc.
* In Romance languages, repeated rebracketing can change an initial ''l'' to an ''n'' (first removing the ''l'' by analyzing it as the definite article ''l{{'}}'', and then adding ''n'' by rebracketing from the indefinite article ''un''), or the reverse. Examples include:&lt;ref&gt;Ti Alkire, Carol Rosen (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=9P3Ifze8gUQC&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;dq=unicorne%20licorne%20icorne&amp;pg=PA305#v=onepage&amp;q=unicorne%20licorne%20icorne&amp;f=false ''Romance Languages: A Historical Introduction''], p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;
** Latin *''libellu'' (English ''level'') becoming ''nivel'' in Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish, and ''niveau'' in French.
** Latin ''unicornuus'' (English ''unicorn'') became ''licorne'' in French, via ''unicorne'' &gt;&gt; ''un'' ''icorne'' (a unicorn), and finally, with juncture loss, ''l'icorne'' (the unicorn) &gt;&gt; ''licorne''.
* In [[Swahili language|Swahili]], ''kitabu'' ("book") is derived from [[Arabic]] ''kitāb''. However, the word is split as a native Swahili word (''ki'' + ''tabu'') and declined accordingly (plural ''vitabu''). This violates the original [[triliteral root]] of the original Arabic (''[[K-T-B]]'').
* Many words coined in a scientific context as neologisms are formed with suffixes arising from rebracketing existing terms. One example is the suffix ''-ol'' used to name [[alcohol]]s, such as [[methanol]]. Its origin is the rebracketing of ''al•cohol'' as ''alcoh•ol''. The word ''alcohol'' derives from the Arabic ''al-kuḥl'', in which ''al'' is the definite article and ''kuḥl'' (i.e., [[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]]), is based on the Semitic triliteral root ''{{nowrap|[[:wikt:ك_ح_ل#Arabic|K-Ḥ-L]]}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|methanol}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the suffix ''-ome'' as in ''[[genome]]'', obtained by rebracketing ''chromo•some'' as ''chromos•ome''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|genome}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Scottish Gaelic]] the [[definite article]] is pronounced run together with vowel-initial nouns without audible gap. (Compare [[French language|French]].) This union has provided a rich source of opportunities for rebracketing. Historically the article's various case-, number- and gender-specific forms ended in either a vowel, a nasal or an /s/, the latter later becoming an /h/ over time. Over time, the last syllable of the article was either eroded completely or weakened and partially lost, but where rebracketing had occurred, what had been the final consonant of the article came to be treated as the initial of the following noun. Example: &lt;i lang="gd"&gt;an inghnean&lt;/i&gt; ( &lt; &lt;i lang="cel"&gt;*(s)indā inigenā&lt;/i&gt;) gave rise to an alternative form &lt;i lang="gd"&gt;an ighean&lt;/i&gt; 'the girl' this in turn becoming &lt;i lang="gd"&gt;an nighean&lt;/i&gt;. As a second, more extreme example, the Scottish Gaelic words for 'nettle' include &lt;i lang="gd"&gt;neanntag, eanntag, deanntag&lt;/i&gt; and even &lt;i lang="gd"&gt;feanntag&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, many forms of the article cause grammatically-conditioned [[initial consonant mutation]] of the following noun. The original cause of this mutation in the [[Celtic language]]s was an across-the-board [[lenition|change of pronunciation]] of certain non-germinate consonants where they were either trapped between two vowels, or else between a vowel or certain other consonants. Mutation gave rise to yet more possibilities for reanalysis, the form &lt;i lang="gd"&gt;feanntag&lt;/i&gt; mentioned earlier possibly being one such example. Calder 'A Gaelic Grammar' (1923) has a useful list.

== Examples of false splitting ==

=== In English ===
{{Wiktionary category|type=examples of juncture loss in English|category=English nouns which have interacted with their indefinite article}}

As demonstrated in the examples above, the primary reason of juncture loss in English is the confusion between "a" and "an". In [[blackletter|Medieval script]], words were often written so close together that for some [[Middle English]] scholars it was hard to tell where one began and another ended. The results include the following words in English:
* [[Vipera berus|adder]]: Middle English ''a naddre'' ("a snake") taken for ''an addre''.
* [[pelvis|aitchbone]]: Middle English ''a nachebon'' ("a buttock bone") taken for ''an hach boon''.
* [[wikt:another#Usage notes|another]], formed by combining "an other" into one word, is sometimes colloquially split into "a nother" and a qualifier inserted as in "a whole nother issue".
* [[apron]]: Middle English ''a napron'' taken for ''an apron''.
* [[auger (drill)|auger]]: Middle English ''a nauger'' taken for ''an auger''.
* [[decoy]]: Most commonly thought to stem from Dutch ''de kooi'', in which ''de'' is the definite article and ''kooi'' means cage. An alternative theory is that the Dutch compound noun ''eendenkooi'', earlier spelled ''eendekooi'', meaning "duck decoy", from ''eend'' "duck" + ''kooi'', was reanalyzed and split, in the process of being transferred to English, as ''een dekooi'', in which ''een'' is the Dutch indefinite article. 
* [[wikt:eyas|eyas]]: Middle English ''a niyas'' (from French ''niais'' from Late Latin ''nidiscus'' (from Latin ''nidus'' = "nest")) taken for ''an eias''.
* [[humble pie]]: Middle English ''a numble'' taken for ''an umble'' (ultimately from Latin ''lumbulus'', this is also an example of [[Homorganic consonants|homorganic]]ness).
* [[wikt:impious|impious]]: originally ''im''-''[[wikt:pious|pious]]'', now pronounced as though ''[[wikt:imp|imp]]''-''ious''
* [[wikt:lone|lone]]: Middle English ''al one'' (all one) taken for ''a-lone''.
* [[newt]]: Middle English ''an eute'' (cognate with ''eft'') taken for ''a neute''.
* [[nickname]]: Middle English ''an eke name'' ("an additional name") taken for ''a neke name''.
* [[Wiktionary:nonce|the nonce]]: Middle English, for old English ''þen ānes'' (''the one [occasion]'').
* nuncle (dialectical form of [[uncle]]): Middle English ''mine uncle'' taken for ''my nuncle''.
* [[omelette]]: Seventeenth-century English loanword from French, developed there via earlier forms ''amelette'', ''alemette'' and ''alemelle'' from ''la lemelle'' ("the omelette") taken for ''l'alemelle''; ultimately from Latin ''lamella'' ("blade"), perhaps because of the thin shape of the omelette ([[SOED]]).
* ought ["zero"]: Middle English ''a nought'' ("a nothing") taken for ''an ought''. Ultimately distinct from Old English ''naught'' ("nothing"), of complex and convergent etymology, from ''na'' ("not") and ''wight'' ("living thing, man"), but cf. ''aught'' ("anything", "worthy", etc.), itself ultimately from ''aye'' ("ever") and ''wight'' ([[SOED]]).
* [[wikt:tother|tother]]: Old English (now dialectal) ''that other'' taken for ''the tother''.
* [[umpire]]: Middle English ''a noumpere'' taken for ''an oumpere''.

=== In French ===
In [[French language|French]] similar confusion arose between "le/la" and "l'-" as well as "de" and "d'-".

* French ''démonomancie'' ("[[methods of divination#D|demonomancy]]") taken for ''d'émonomancie'' ("of [[methods of divination#E|emonomancy]]").{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}
* [[Old French]] ''lonce'' ("[[lynx]]") taken for ''l'once'', thus giving rise to ''once'' (hence {{lang-en|ounce}}), now more often applied to the [[snow leopard]].
* Old French ''une norenge'' ('an orange') taken for ''une orenge''.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year = 2013 | title = orange ''n''.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and ''adj''.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary online | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | url =http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/132163 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''boutique'' from Greek-derived Latin ''apotheca'', a change found in some Romance languages (e.g. Italian ''bottega'', Spanish ''bodega'', Sicilian ''putìa''), a putative proto-Romance ''l'aboteca'' or ''l'abodega'' taken for ''la'' + [[lexeme]].

=== In Dutch ===
Dutch shares several examples with English, but also has some of its own. Many examples were created by reanalysing an initial ''n-'' as part of a preceding article or case ending.

* adder: As in English.
* arreslee ([[horse]]-drawn [[sleigh]]): From early modern Dutch ''een (n)arreslede'', from ''nar'' "fool, jester" + ''slede'' "sleigh".
* avegaar "auger": As in English.
* omelette: As in English.
* spijt "pity, regret": From Middle Dutch ''despijt'', from Old French ''despit'' "spite". Reanalysed as ''de spijt'' "the pity".

=== In Arabic ===

In [[Arabic language|Arabic]] the confusion is generally with non-Arabic words beginning in "al-" (''al'' is Arabic for "the").
* [[Alexander the Great]] has been interpreted in Arabic as ''Iskandar''; by extension
** Greek ''Alexandreia'' ([[Alexandria]]) taken for ''al Exandreia'' (and thus ''Al-Iskandariyah''; this is also an example of [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]]).
** Greek ''Alexandretta'' taken for ''al Exandretta'' (and thus ''Iskenderun''; this too is an example of metathesis).
* Visigothic ''Ulishbona'' ([[Lisbon]]) taken for ''ul Ishbona'' (and thus medieval Arabic ''al-Ishbūnah'').

===In Greek===

* Negroponte ([[Euboea]]) from στὸ Νεύριπον 'to Nevripos', rebracketing of στὸν Εὔριπον 'to Evripos', and then a [[folk etymology]] connecting it to Italian ''ponte'' 'bridge'&lt;ref&gt;[[Euboea#Name]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cattaro ([[Kotor]]) from Δεκάτερα, ''Decatera'' splitting to De Catera (of Catera) in Italian, then to Cattaro/Kotor.

== Examples of juncture loss ==

* ''ajar'' from ''on char'' ("on turn").
* ''[[alligator]]'' from Spanish ''el lagarto'' ("the lizard").
* ''alone'' from ''all one''.
* ''atone'' from ''at one''.

=== From Arabic "al" ===
Perhaps the most common case of juncture loss in English comes from the Arabic ''al'' (mentioned above), mostly via Spanish, Portuguese, and Medieval Latin:

==== Spanish ====
* Arabic ''al-faṣfaṣa'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as ''alfalfa'', [[alfalfa]].
* Arabic ''al-kharrūba'' in Spanish as ''algarroba'', [[carob]].
* Arabic ''al-hilāl'' in Spanish as ''alfiler'', pin.
* Arabic ''al-hurj'' in Spanish as ''alforja'', saddlebag.
* Arabic ''al-[[qadi|qāḍī]]'' in Spanish as ''alcalde'', [[alcalde]].
* Arabic ''al-[[qaid|qāʾid]]'' in Spanish as ''alcaide'', commander.
* Arabic ''al-[[Adder (disambiguation)|qaṣr]]'' in Spanish as ''alcázar'', [[alcazar (disambiguation)|alcazar]].
* Arabic ''al-qubba'' in Spanish as ''alcoba'', [[alcove (architecture)|alcove]].
* Arabic ''al-ʿuṣāra'' in Spanish as ''alizari'', [[Rubia|madder]] root.
* Arabic ''al-rub'' in Spanish as ''[[arroba]]'', a unit of measure.
* Arabic ''al-zahr'' ("the dice") in Spanish as ''azar'', "randomness", and in English as "[[hazard]]"

==== Portuguese ====
* Arabic ''al-bakūra'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as ''albacor'', [[albacore]].
* Arabic ''al-ġaṭṭās'' in Portuguese as ''alcatraz'', [[albatross]].

==== Medieval Latin ====
* Arabic ''al-ʾanbīq'' in [[Medieval Latin]] as ''alembicus'', [[alembic]].
* Arabic ''al-dabarān'' in Medieval Latin as ''Aldebaran'', [[Aldebaran]].
* Arabic ''al-ḥinnāʾ'' in Medieval Latin as ''alchanna'', [[henna]].
* Arabic ''al-ʿiḍāda'' in Medieval Latin as ''alidada'', sighting rod.
* Arabic ''al-jabr'' in Medieval Latin as ''algebra'', [[algebra]].
* Arabic ''al-Khwarizmi'' in Medieval Latin as ''algorismus'', [[algorism]].
* Arabic ''al-kīmiyāʾ'' in Medieval Latin as ''alchymia'', [[alchemy]].
* Arabic ''al-kuḥl'' (powdered [[antimony]]) in Medieval Latin as ''[[alcohol]]'', which see for the change of meaning.
* Arabic ''al-qily'' in Medieval Latin as ''alkali'', [[alkali]].
* Arabic ''al-qurʾān'' in Medieval Latin as ''alcorānum'', [[qur'an|Koran]].

==== Other ====
* Arabic ''al-ġūl'' in English as ''[[Algol]]''.
* Arabic ''al-majisti'' in French as ''almageste'', [[almagest]].
* Arabic ''al-minbar'' in [[Medieval Hebrew]] as ''ʾalmēmār'', [[bema]].
* Arabic ''al-qaly'' in English as ''alkali'', alkaline.
* Arabic ''al-kuħl'' in Old French as alcohol (modern French alcool), and in English as ''alcohol''.

===In Greek===
Junctural metanalysis played a role in the development of new words in the earliest period of Greek literature: during the oral transmission of the Homeric epics. Many words in the Homeric epics that are etymologically inexplicable through normal linguistic analysis begin to make some sense when junctural metanalysis at some stage in the transmission is assumed: e.g., the formula ''eche nedumos hypnos'' "sweet sleep held (him)" appears to be a resegmentation of ''echen edumos hypnos''. Steve Reece has discovered several dozen similar instances of metanalysis in Homer, thereby shedding new light on their etymologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homer's Winged Words: The Evolution of Early Greek Epic Diction in the Light of Oral Theory|last=Reece|first=Steve|publisher=Brill|year=2009|isbn=978-90-04-17441-2|location=Leiden and Boston|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juncture loss is common in later Greek as well, especially in place names, or in borrowings of Greek names in Italian and Turkish, where particles (εις, στην, στον, σε) are fused with the original name.&lt;ref name="Bourne1887" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marek Stachowski, Robert Woodhouse, "The Etymology of İstanbul: Making Optimal Use of the Evidence" ''Studia Etymologica Cracoviensia'' '''20''': 221–245 (2015) {{doi|10.4467/20843836SE.15.015.2801}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="luxoro"&gt;C.

A '''regnal year''' is a year of the reign of a [[monarch|sovereign]], from the [[Latin]] ''regnum'' meaning kingdom, rule.

The oldest dating systems were in regnal years,{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} and considered the date as an [[ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal]], not a [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]]. For example, a monarch could have a first year of rule, a second year of rule, a third year of rule, and so on, but not a [[year zero|zeroth year]] of rule. 

Applying this ancient [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] system to modern calculations of time, which include zero, is what led to the [[Millennium#Debate over millennium celebrations|debate over when the third millennium began]].

Regnal years are "finite era names", contrary to "infinite era names" such as [[Anno Domini|Christian era]], [[Japanese imperial year|Jimmu era]], [[North Korean calendar|Juche era]], and so on.

==Reckoning in various cultures==
In ancient times, [[calendar]]s were counted in terms of the number of years of the reign of the current [[monarch]]. Reckoning long periods of times required a [[king list]]. The oldest such reckoning is preserved in the [[Sumerian king list]].

In England, and later the United Kingdom, until 1963, each [[Act of Parliament]] was defined by its serial number within the session of parliament in which it was enacted, which in turn was denoted by the [[Regnal years of English monarchs|regnal year or years of the monarch]] in which it fell.

In Canada, acts of [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] are dated by the session, the Parliament, the regnal year, and the calendar year. So, for example, a bill passed in the second session during the period spanning 2007–2008 would be dated thus:
Second Session, Thirty-ninth Parliament,
56–57 Elizabeth II, 2007–2008

The [[Zoroastrian calendar]] also operated with regnal years following the reform of [[Ardashir I]] (3rd century).

While not strictly a regnal year, time in the United States of America can be derived from the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]] (July 4, 1776). For example, the [[United states constitution|U.S. Constitution]] is dated as signed in "the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and Eighty seven and of the Independence of the United States of America the Twelfth," and [[President of the United States|Presidential]] proclamations will often be ended "IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this [ordinal] day of [month], in the year of our Lord [year], and of the Independence of the United States of America the [year]." {{CURRENTYEAR}} is the {{ordinal|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1775}}}} year of the Independence of the United States of America on and after [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]] of that year. Time is also sometimes reckoned in terms (and sessions, if necessary) of [[United States Congress|Congress]]; e.g. House of Representatives Bill 2 of the 112th Congress is dated "112th CONGRESS, 1st Session".&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.2: 112 H.R. 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Regnal years were generally used for year marking in East Asia before the advent of era names. In China, the first continuous use of era names was in 140BC. Prior to that, years were usually marked as regnal years of the king or emperor.

From 140BC, an era name was assigned as the name of each year by the leader (emperor or king) of the [[East Asia]]n countries during some portion of their history. The people of the country referred to that year by that name. Era names were used for over two millennia by Chinese emperors and are still used in [[North Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Taiwan]]. It could last from one year to the length of the leader's reign. If it lasted more than one year, numbers were appended to the era name. If it lasted the entire length of the leader's reign, then that leader is often referred to by that name posthumously. However, the leader was often given a more complex formal [[posthumous name]] as well. It should not be confused with a [[temple name]], by which many leaders are known.

The [[Lanfang Republic]] era, [[Republic of Formosa]] era and [[Republic of China era]] are era names without an emperor. The [[:zh:孔子紀年|Confucius era]] and [[Juche calendar|Juche era]] are based on the year of birth of the thinker or [[Eternal President of the Republic|eternal president]]. The [[:zh:黃帝紀元|Huangdi era]], [[:zh:檀君紀元|Dangun era]] and [[Japanese_era_name#Imperial_year|kōki]] were counted in terms of the number of years of the reign of the first [[monarch]]. The [[Tibetan Empire]], [[Kingdom of Khotan]], [[Liao Dynasty]], [[Western Xia]], [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]], [[Kara-Khitan Khanate]], [[Mongol Empire]], [[Northern Yuan Dynasty]], [[Qing Dynasty]], [[Nguyễn Dynasty]], [[Joseon Dynasty]], [[:ja:共戴紀元|Bogd Khaanate of Mongolia]] and [[North Korea]] also use non-Chinese era names. Some are transliterations of their Chinese era names. Chinese era names were also employed in other East Asian countries.

Abolished era names may be reused, for example as a means of claiming or denying political legitimacy. An example of this is, that when the [[Yongle emperor]] usurped the throne from his nephew he dated the year of his accession as "洪武三十五年", the 35th year of his father, the [[Hongwu Emperor]]'s reign, i.e. 1402. Hongwu had in fact died in 1398, and the short reign of the [[Jianwen Emperor]], who ruled between 1398 and 1402 was written out of the official record. However, they would sometimes still be used. 景初四年 (240) was used on Japanese [[bronze mirrors]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zj-jtest.com/chrbwhtsh/rbwh4-1.htm 王勇著]&lt;/ref&gt; 廣德四年 (766) and 建中八年 (787) were used in a [[Western Regions]] tomb and a document.&lt;ref&gt;[http://military.china.com/zh_cn/history4/62/20050323/12189172_1.html 长河落日圆——详议安史之乱&amp;#91;中&amp;#93;(2)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kuchlug]] did not change the era name.{{clarify|date=July 2016}}

After the [[Ming Dynasty]] fell, the [[Joseon Dynasty]] still used [[Chongzhen]], and the [[Kingdom of Tungning]] still used [[Yongli]]  regnal years, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianhistory.com/data/articles/a02/1836.html  17、18世纪朝鲜使用中国年号问题]&lt;/ref&gt; thus denying the legitimacy of the Qing dynasty, and showing continued allegiance to the Ming regime. 

The short lived [[:zh:兴朝通宝|Daxi kingdom]], post [[Zhang Xianzhong]], used the [[Chinese calendar correspondence table|Ganzhi calendar]] without era names. [[Overseas Chinese]] used Longfei (龍飛) or Tianyun (天運).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xiao-en.org/cultural/magazine.asp?cat=34&amp;loc=zh&amp;id=1192 馬來西亞華人殯葬業的演變與挑戰中國長沙民政學院殯儀系主辦《現代殯葬教育十年慶典研討會》論文（上）]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese era names===
The Chinese eras (年號, niánhào) were used sporadically from 156 BC and continuously from 140 BC. Until 1367 AD several were used during each emperor's reign. From 1368 AD until 1912 AD only one era name was used by each emperor, who was posthumously known by his era name, which meant that the era name became equivalent to a regnal year. The tradition of Chinese era names survives in the Republic of China's [[Minguo calendar]], with ''Minguo'', the Chinese for Republic, taking the place of the era name.

===Japanese===
The official Japanese system or {{nihongo|''Gengō''|元号}} numbers years from the accession of the current [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]], regarding the calendar year during which the accession occurred as the first year. The current emperor [[Akihito]] succeeded to the throne on 7 January 1989 on the death of his father [[Hirohito|Emperor Shōwa]], and the new era name [[Heisei period|Heisei]] was decreed by the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]]. Thus the year 1989 corresponds to {{Nihongo|Heisei 1|平成元年|Heisei gannen|or "first year"}}. The system was in use sporadically from 645 and continuously from 701. Until 1867 several era names were used during each emperor's reign. From 1868 only one has been used by each emperor. Since 1868 each emperor has been known posthumously by his era name.

===Korean===
Korea used independent era names whilst reigning in all of its variety of nations. Korean endemic eras were used from 391 to 1274 and from 1894 to 1910. During the later years of the Joseon Dynasty, years were also numbered from the founding of that dynasty in 1393. From 1952 until 1961, years were numbered in [[Dangun|Dangi]] in South Korea, counting from the legendary founding of [[Gojoseon]] in 2333 BC.

The tradition of Korean era names survives in the North Korean [[Juche calendar]], with Juche year 1 being 1912 the year of the birth of Kim Il-sung.

'''Gotthold Julius Rudolph Sohm''' (29 October 1841 in [[Rostock]] &amp;ndash; 16 May 1917 in [[Leipzig]]) was a German [[jurist]]  and [[Church history|Church historian]] as well as a [[Theology|theologian]]. He published works concerning [[Roman law|Roman]] and German law, [[Canon law]] and Church History.

==Biography==
A [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], Sohm studied Law in Rostock,&lt;ref&gt;See entries of [http://matrikel.uni-rostock.de/gnd/118615238 Rudolph Sohm] in [[Rostock Matrikelportal]]&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin, Heidelberg and Munich between 1860 and 1864. His doctoral dissertation in 1864 at the [[University of Rostock]] was on [[Roman law|Roman Law]]; he then worked on German legal history and devoted himself to ecclesiastical law. He lectured in German Law and Commercial Law at the [[University of Göttingen]] from 1866 to 1870, before being appointed professor at that university in 1870.  He was professor in Canon Law and German Law at the [[University of Freiburg im Breisgau]] 1870 to 1872, and at the [[University of Strasbourg]] from 1872 to 1887, and was appointed Rector in 1882. From 1887 until his death in 1917 he was professor of Canon Law and German Law in the Faculty of Law at the [[University of Leipzig]].&lt;ref name=Sohm&gt;[http://www.uni-leipzig.de/unigeschichte/professorenkatalog/leipzig/Sohm_1003 Sohm on the [[University of Leipzig]] website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892 he published the first volume of his great work ''Kirchenrecht'' (''Canon Law'').&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Sohm, ''Kirchenrecht''. Leipzig: Duncher &amp; Humblot, 1892.&lt;/ref&gt; The second volume was published posthumously in 1923. In this work Sohm argued that the [[Early Church]] had no legal constitution. He  stated that "ecclesiastical law stands in contradiction to the nature of Ecclesia." The Early Church, he argued, was ruled not by legal concepts but by a power he called "[[charisma]]" (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] 'charis'), which is "a gift of grace" bestowed by the [[Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name=rags/&gt; In his work Sohm explored how the charismatically based Jesus movement of the [[Early Church]] changed into the legalistic bureaucracy of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. The [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Max Weber]] derived his concept 'charismatic authority' from Sohm's 'charismatic organization,' a term Sohm had coined in ''Kirchenrecht'' to describe the social organization of primitive Christianity.

''Kirchenrecht'' was immediately recognized in Germany as an epoch-making work. It also stimulated a debate between Sohm and leading theologians and religion scholars which lasted more than twenty years and stimulated a rich [[polemic]]al literature.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, David Norman. "Faith, Reason, and Charisma: Rudolf Sohm, Max Weber, and the Theology of Grace," ''Sociological Inquiry'', 68:1 pp. 32-60, 1998, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sohm was one of the committee of 22 members, comprising not only [[jurist]]s but also representatives of financial interests and of the various ideological currents of the time, who compiled a second draft of the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]] (German Civil Code) which was accepted by the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] in 1896. Also in 1896, with [[Friedrich Naumann]] and [[Caspar René Gregory]], he founded the [[National-Social Association]] (National-Sozial Partei), based on Socialist Christianity.&lt;ref name=rags&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/research/sohm-rudolf-eorl-12/ Short article on Sohm on bookrags.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The party failed in the elections of 1898 and 1903 and was then dissolved into the [[Freeminded Union]].

He was a Member of [[The Royal Academy for Science and the Arts of Belgium]] in [[Brussels]], was a Corresponding Member of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] in Munich between 1875 and 1917, and a member of the Philology and History class of the Royal Saxon Society of Sciences in Leipzig from 1892 to 1917.&lt;ref name=Sohm/&gt; In 1914 the book ''Festgabe für Rudolph Sohm, dargebracht zum goldenen Doktorjubiläum von Freunden'' was published in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of Sohm receiving his doctorate.&lt;ref&gt;Published by Schülern und Verehrern'' in Leipzig, (1914)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Sohm was awarded the [[Pour le Mérite]] (civil class) in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orden-pourlemerite.de/mitglieder/rudolph-sohm?m=3&amp;u=5 Sohm on the Order of the Pour le Mérite website]&lt;/ref&gt; One of his students was [[Walter Simons]].

Rudolph Sohm died in [[Leipzig]] in 1917 aged 75.

The '''Sri Lankan Civil War''' was an armed conflict fought on the island of [[Sri Lanka]]. Beginning on 23 July 1983, there was an intermittent [[insurgency]] against the [[Government of Sri Lanka|government]] by the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (the LTTE, also known as the Tamil Tigers), which fought to create an [[Independence|independent]] [[Tamils|Tamil]] state called [[Tamil Eelam]] in the north and the east of the island. After a 26-year military campaign, the [[2008–2009 Sri Lankan Army Northern offensive|Sri Lankan military defeated the Tamil Tigers in May 2009]], bringing the civil war to an end.&lt;ref name="mod-defeat"&gt;{{cite news |title=LTTE defeated; Sri Lanka liberated from terror |date=18 May 2009 |url=http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20090518_10 |work=Ministry of Defence |accessdate=18 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521113622/http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20090518_10 |archivedate=21 May 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For over 25 years, the war caused significant hardships for the population, environment and the [[Economy of Sri Lanka|economy of the country]], with an initial estimated 80,000–100,000 people killed during its course.&lt;ref name="ABC200509"&gt;{{cite news|title=Up to 100,000 killed in Sri Lanka's civil war: UN |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/05/20/2576543.htm|newspaper=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Australia]]|date=20 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, the UN panel estimated additional deaths during the last phase of the war: "Around 40,000 died while other independent reports estimated the number of civilians dead to exceed 100,000."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.time.com/2013/11/28/sri-lanka-to-start-tally-of-civil-war-dead/|title=Sri Lanka to Start Tally of Civil-War Dead|first=Krista|last=Mahr|publisher=|via=world.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early part of the conflict, the Sri Lankan forces attempted to retake the areas captured by the LTTE. The tactics employed by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam against the actions of Government forces resulted in their listing as a terrorist organisation in 32 countries, including the United States, India, Canada and the member nations of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam#Proscription as a terrorist group|here]] for related references.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sri Lankan government forces have also been accused of human rights abuses, systematic impunity for serious human rights violations, lack of respect for [[habeas corpus]] in arbitrary detentions, and forced disappearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://documents.icj.org/ICJ-UPR14-SriLanka.pdf | title=International Commission of Jurists Submission to the Universal Periodic Review of Sri Lanka | work=[[International Commission of Jurists]] | format=PDF | date=April 2012 | accessdate=26 July 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CR9h4Bvo?url=http://documents.icj.org/ICJ-UPR14-SriLanka.pdf | archivedate=25 November 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two decades of fighting and four failed tries at peace talks, including the unsuccessful [[Indian intervention in the Sri Lankan Civil War|deployment of the Indian Army]], the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] from 1987 to 1990, a lasting negotiated settlement to the conflict appeared possible when a cease-fire was declared in December 2001, and a ceasefire agreement signed with international mediation in 2002.&lt;ref name="gd1"&gt;{{cite news|url =https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,655451,00.html|title =Ceasefire raises Sri Lankan peace hopes|work=The Guardian |date = 22 February 2002|location=London|accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, limited hostilities renewed in late 2005 and the conflict began to escalate until the government launched a number of major military offensives against the LTTE beginning in July 2006, driving the LTTE out of the entire [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|Eastern province]] of the island. The LTTE then declared they would "resume their freedom struggle to achieve statehood".&lt;ref name="wt-7/14/07-ffo"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://washingtontimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070714/FOREIGN/107140037/1003|title =Sri Lanka's war seen far from over|work =Amal Jayasinghe|agency = Agence France-Presse|date = 14 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt3"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/25/world/asia/25lanka.html?pagewanted=1|title =Sri Lankan Government Finds Support From Buddhist Monks| work =The New York Times|date = 26 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the government shifted its offensive to the north of the country, and formally announced its withdrawal from the ceasefire agreement on 2 January 2008, alleging that the LTTE violated the agreement over 10,000 times.&lt;ref name="mod-cfa-1/2/08"&gt;{{cite news|title =Government takes policy decision to abrogate failed CFA|date =2 January 2008|url =http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20080102_12|work =Ministry of Defence|accessdate =2 January 2008|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080105051601/http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20080102_12|archivedate =5 January 2008|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, aided by the destruction of a number of large arms smuggling vessels that belonged to the LTTE,&lt;ref name="mod-kkd-10/08/07"&gt;{{cite news|title =Sri Lanka Navy destroys the 10th LTTE arms ship 1700 km off Dondra|date =8 October 2007|url =http://www.navy.lk/index.php?id=482|work =Sri Lanka Navy|accessdate =19 November 2007|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071026220011/http://www.navy.lk/index.php?id=482|archivedate =26 October 2007|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an international crackdown on the funding for the Tamil Tigers, the government took control of the entire area previously controlled by the Tamil Tigers, including their de facto capital [[Kilinochchi]], main military base [[Mullaitivu]] and the entire [[A9 highway (Sri Lanka)|A9 highway]],&lt;ref name="blm-1/26-rebelbase"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a5Kn9DSTKa30&amp;refer=home Sri Lankan Forces Capture Last Major Rebel Base in Northeast] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613163056/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087 |date=13 June 2010 }}, ''Bloomberg''.&lt;/ref&gt; leading the LTTE to finally admit defeat on 17 May 2009.&lt;ref name="correspondentscivil"&gt;{{cite news |author=From correspondents in Colombo |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,25496902-401,00.html |title=Tamil Tigers admit defeat in civil war after 37-year battle |publisher=News.com.au |date=17 May 2009 |accessdate=17 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519011848/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C27574%2C25496902-401%2C00.html |archivedate=19 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the LTTE's defeat, pro-LTTE [[Tamil National Alliance]] dropped its demand for a [[Tamil Eelam|separate state]], in favour of a [[Federalism|federal]] solution.&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lanka Tamil party drops statehood demand |date=13 March 2010|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8566114.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate =18 August 2011|first=Charles|last=Haviland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardn"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lankan Tamils drop demand for separate independent homeland |date=14 March 2010|url =https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/14/tamils-drop-calls-for-separate-state|work=The Guardian |accessdate =18 August 2011|location=London|first=Jason|last=Burke}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]], the then president of Sri Lanka, appointed the [[Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission]] (LLRC) to assess the conflict between the time of the ceasefire agreement in 2002 and the defeat of the LTTE in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perera|first=Amrith Rohan|url=http://slembassyusa.org/downloads/LLRC-REPORT.pdf.|title=Report of the Commission of Inquiry on the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and evolution==
{{Main article|Origins of the Sri Lankan civil war}}

The origins of the Sri Lankan Civil War lie in the continuous political rancor between the majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2015 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | title= Despite the Terrors of Typologies: The Importance of Understanding Categories of Difference and Identity | url= http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/riij20/17/2#.VR03CzuUdPM | journal= Interventions: International Journal of Postcolonial Studies | volume=  17 | issue=  2 | pages= 174–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of the modern conflict lie in the [[British Ceylon|British colonial rule]] when the country was known as Ceylon. There was initially little tension among Sri Lanka's two largest ethnic groups, the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] and the [[Sri Lankan Tamil people|Tamils]], when [[Ponnambalam Arunachalam]], a Tamil, was appointed representative of the Sinhalese as well the Tamils in the national legislative council. In 1919 major Sinhalese and Tamil political organizations united to form the Ceylon National Congress, under the leadership of Arunachalam, to press the colonial government for more constitutional reforms. However, British Gov. [[William Manning (colonial governor)|William Manning]] actively encouraged the concept of "communal representation" and created the [[Colombo]] town seat in 1920, which dangled between the Tamils and the Sinhalese.&lt;ref name="tamllib"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sangam.org/2010/12/Tamil_Struggle_18.php | title = Sri Lankan Tamil Struggle – Chapter 18: The First Sinhalese- Tamil Rift | publisher = Ilankai Tamil Sangam | accessdate =19 January 2012 | work = T. Sabaratnam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After their election to the [[State Council of Ceylon|State Council]] in 1936, the [[Lanka Sama Samaja Party]] (LSSP) members [[N.M. Perera]] and [[Philip Gunawardena]] demanded the replacement of English as the official language by Sinhala and Tamil. In November 1936 a motion that "in the Municipal and Police Courts of the Island the proceedings should be in the [[vernacular]]" and that "entries in [[police station]]s should be recorded in the language in which they are originally stated" were passed by the State Council and referred to the Legal Secretary. However, in 1944 [[J.R. Jayawardene]] moved in the State Council that [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] should replace English as the official language.

In 1948, immediately after independence, a controversial law was passed by the [[Ceylon Parliament]] called the [[Ceylon Citizenship Act]], which deliberately discriminated against the [[Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka|Indian Tamil]] ethnic minority by making it virtually impossible for them to obtain citizenship in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uthr.org/BP/volume1/Chapter1.htm|title=Welcome to UTHR, Sri Lanka|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately over 700,000 [[Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka|Indian Tamils]] were made stateless. Over the next three decades more than 300,000 [[Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka|Indian Tamils]] were deported back to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ices.lk/sl_database/ethnic_conflict/time_line.shtml|title=Ethnic Conflict of Sri Lanka: Time Line – From Independence to 1999|publisher=International Centre for Ethnic Studies|accessdate=11 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212123102/http://www.ices.lk/sl_database/ethnic_conflict/time_line.shtml|archivedate=12 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until 2003–55 years after independence—that all [[Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka|Indian Tamils]] living in Sri Lanka were granted citizenship, but by this time they only made up 5% of the island's population.

In 1956 Prime Minister [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike]] passed the "[[Sinhala Only Act]]", which replaced [[English language|English]] with [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] as the only [[official language]] of the country. This was seen as a deliberate attempt to discourage the [[Sri Lankan Tamils]] from working in the [[Ceylon Civil Service]] and other [[public services]]. The [[Tamil language|Tamil]]-speaking minorities of Ceylon (Sri Lankan Tamils, [[Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka|Indian Tamils]] and [[Sri Lankan Moors]]) viewed the Act as linguistic, cultural and [[economic discrimination]] against them.&lt;ref name="RP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/Background-to-brutality|title=Background to brutality|last=McConnell|first=Deirdre|date=7 April 2009|publisher=Red Pepper|accessdate=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Tamil-speaking [[civil servants]]/[[public servants]] were forced to resign because they weren't [[fluency|fluent]] in Sinhala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20090223/raychaudhuri|title=Will Sri Lanka Drive the Tigers to Extinction? |last=Raychaudhuri|first=Sumana|date=6 February 2009|publisher=The Nation|accessdate=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a prelude to the [[Gal Oya riots|1956 Gal Oya riots]] and the [[1958 riots in Ceylon|1958 widespread riots]] in which thousands of Tamil civilians perished. The civil war was a direct result of the escalation of the confrontational politics that followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Staff profile : Jonathan Spencer | author = [[University of Edinburgh]] | url = http://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/staff/social_anthropology/spencer_jonathan | accessdate =20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s documents relating to a separate Tamil state of "[[Tamil Eelam]]" began to circulate. At this time [[Anton Balasingham]], an employee of the British [[High Commission]] in Colombo, began to participate in separatist activities. He later migrated to Britain, where he became the chief theoretician of the LTTE. In the late 1960s several Tamil youth, among them [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]], also became involved in these activities. They carried out several hit-and-run operations against pro-government Tamil politicians, [[Sri Lanka police]] and the civil administration.

During the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7QEjPVyd9YMC&amp;pg=PA535&amp;lpg=PA535&amp; | title=Encyclopedia of Diasporas|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Policy of standardization]] was initiated. Under the policy, students were admitted to university in proportion to the number of applicants who sat for the examination in their language. Officially the policy was designed to increase the representation of students from rural areas. In practice the policy reduced the numbers of [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] students who had previously, based on their examination scores alone, gained admission in a higher proportion than their participation in the examination. They were now required to gain higher marks than Sinhalese students to gain admission to universities.&lt;ref name="RP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newint.org/issue128/pogrom.htm |title=Sri Lanka's pogrom |last=R.L.

The policy was abandoned in 1977.&lt;ref name="SriModernAge"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wickremasinghe|first= Nira |title=Sri Lanka in the Modern Age: A History of Contested Identities |publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year= 2006 |isbn= 0-8248-3016-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of official discrimination against the Sri Lankan Tamils included the [[Sri Lankan state sponsored colonisation schemes|state-sponsored colonization]] of traditional Tamil areas by Sinhalese [[peasants]], the [[Banning of Tamil-language media importation|banning]] of the import of Tamil-language media and the preference given by the 1978 [[Constitution of Sri Lanka]] to [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Buddhism]], the main religion followed by the Sinhalese.&lt;ref name="RP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NI"/&gt;

Prabhakaran—together with Chetti Thanabalasingam, a well known criminal from Kalviyankadu, Jaffna—formed the [[Tamil New Tigers]] (TNT) in 1972.&lt;ref name="rohang"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://212.150.54.123/articles/articledet.cfm?articleid=57 |title=International and Regional Implications of the Sri Lankan Tamil Insurgency |author=[[Rohan Gunaratna]] |date=December 1998 |accessdate=27 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930204349/http://212.150.54.123/articles/articledet.cfm?articleid=57 |archivedate=30 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was formed around an ideology that looked back to the 1st Millennium [[Chola Empire]]—the Tiger was the emblem of that empire.

A further movement, the [[Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students]] (EROS), formed in [[Manchester]] and London; it became the backbone of the Eelamist movement in the diaspora, arranging passports and employment for immigrants and levying a heavy tax on them. It became the basis of the Eelamist logistical organization, later taken over entirely by the LTTE. The formation of the [[Tamil United Liberation Front]] (TULF) with the Vaddukkodei (Vattukottai) resolution of 1976 led to a hardening of attitudes. The resolution called for the creation of a secular, socialist state of Tamil Eelam, based on the right of [[self-determination]].&lt;ref name="vaduk"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sangam.org/FB_HIST_DOCS/vaddukod.htm | title=Vaddukkodei resolution | accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TULF clandestinely supported the armed actions of the young militants who were dubbed ''"our boys"''. TULF leader [[Appapillai Amirthalingam]] even provided letters of reference to the LTTE and to other Tamil insurgent groups to raise funds.&lt;ref name="rohang" /&gt; Amirthalingam introduced Prabhakaran to N.S. Krishnan, who later became the first international representative of LTTE. It was Krishnan who introduced Prabhakaran to Anton Balasingham, who later became the chief political strategist and chief negotiator of LTTE. The "boys" were the product of the post-war population explosion. Many partially educated, unemployed Tamil youth fell for revolutionary solutions to their problems. The leftist parties had remained "non-communal" for a long time, but the Federal Party (as well as its offshoot, the TULF), deeply conservative and dominated by [[Vellalar]] casteism, did not attempt to form a national alliance with the leftists in their fight for language rights.

Following the sweeping electoral victory of the [[United National Party]] (UNP) in July 1977, the TULF became the leading opposition party, with around one-sixth of the total electoral vote winning on a party platform of secession from Sri Lanka. After the [[Sri Lankan riots of 1977|1977 riots]] the [[Junius Richard Jayewardene|J.R. Jayewardene]] government made one concession to the Tamil population; it lifted the [[policy of standardization]] for university admission that had driven many Tamil youths into militancy. The concession was regarded by the militants as too little too late, and violent attacks continued. By this time TULF started losing its grip over the militant groups. LTTE ordered civilians to boycott the local government elections of 1983 in which even TULF contested. Voter turnout was as low as 10%. Thereafter, Tamil political parties were unable to represent the interests of the Tamil community.&lt;ref name="rohang" /&gt;

==Outbreak of civil war==
{{Main article|Four Four Bravo|Eelam War I}}
Supported by the ongoing politics of conflict in Sri Lanka, politicised Tamil youth in the north and east started to form [[List of Tamil militant groups|militant groups]]. These groups developed independently of the Colombo Tamil leadership, and in the end rejected and annihilated them. The most prominent of these groups was the TNT, which changed its name to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, or the [[LTTE]], in 1976. The LTTE initially carried out a campaign of violence against the state, particularly targeting policemen and also moderate Tamil politicians who attempted a dialogue with the government. Their first major operation was the assassination of the mayor of Jaffna, [[Alfred Duraiappah]], in 1975 by Prabhakaran.&lt;ref name="Hoffman139"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Hoffman | first=Bruce | title=Inside Terrorism | publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] | location=New York | year=2006 | page=139 | isbn=978-0-231-12699-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1981 the burning of the Jaffna library by politicians from the ruling party using police and paramilitary forces resulted in the destruction of more than 90,000 books, including "palm leaf scrolls" of immense historical value. This violent example of ethnic biblioclasm was a major turning point in convincing the Tamil people that the government could not protect them or their cultural heritage and persuaded many of them to back a separate state.

The LTTE's ''modus operandi'' of the early war was based on assassinations, whereas the mode of operation for the UNP was through a series of checkpoints set up around the city. The assassination in 1977 of a Tamil Member of Parliament, M. Canagaratnam, was carried out personally by Prabhakaran, the leader of the LTTE.&lt;ref&gt;Narayan Swamy, "Inside an Elusive Mind-Prabhakaran" Konark Publishers, New Delhi, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1983 the LTTE launched a deadly ambush on [[Sri Lanka army]] patrol [[Four Four Bravo]] outside the town of [[Thirunelveli (Sri Lanka)|Thirunelveli]], killing an officer and 12 soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.atimes.com/ind-pak/DC09Df04.html | title=Whirlpool of Violence, Sri Lanka: The Untold Story | work=Asia Times | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using nationalistic sentiments to their advantage, the Jayawardena organized massacres and [[pogrom]]s in [[Colombo]]{{ref}}, the capital, and elsewhere (see [[Black July]]). Between 400–3,000 Tamils were estimated to have been killed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3090111.stm|title = Twenty years on – riots that led to war|publisher=BBC News| date = 23 July 2003|accessdate=4 January 2010|first=Frances|last=Harrison}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many more fled Sinhalese-majority areas. This is considered the beginning of the civil war.

Apart from the LTTE, there initially was a plethora of militant groups (see [[List of Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups|list]]). The LTTE's position, adopted from that of the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization|PLO]], was that there should be only one. Initially, the LTTE gained prominence due to devastating attacks such as the [[Kent and Dollar Farm massacres]] of 1984, where hundreds of men, women and children were attacked during the night as they slept and were hacked to death with fatal blows to the head from axes; and the [[Anuradhapura massacre]] of 1985, where the LTTE indiscriminately opened fire, killing and wounding 146 civilians within [[Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi]] Buddhist shrine. The Anuradhapura massacre was apparently answered by government forces with the [[Kumudini boat massacre]] in which over 23 Tamil civilians died. Over time the LTTE merged with or largely exterminated almost all the other militant Tamil groups. As a result, many Tamil splinter groups ended up working with the Sri Lankan government as paramilitaries or denounced violence and joined mainstream politics; some legitimate Tamil-oriented political parties remained, all opposed to LTTE's vision of an independent state.

Peace talks between the LTTE and the government began in [[Thimphu]] in 1985, but they soon failed and the war continued. In 1986 many civilians were [[Akkaraipattu massacre|massacred]] as part of this conflict. In 1987 government troops pushed LTTE fighters to the northern city of [[Jaffna]]. In April 1987 the conflict exploded with ferocity, as both government forces and LTTE fighters engaged in a series of bloody operations.

The Sri Lankan military launched an offensive, called "Operation Liberation" or [[Vadamarachchi Operation]], during May–June 1987 to regain control of the territory in the Jaffna peninsula from the LTTE. This marked the Sri Lankan military's first conventional warfare on Sri Lankan soil since independence. The offensive was successful, and LTTE leader Prabhakaran and [[Sea Tiger]] leader [[Thillaiyampalam Sivanesan]] ''alias'' Soosai narrowly escaped from advancing troops at Valvettithurai. Key military personnel involved in the operation were Lt Col. Vipul Boteju, Lt. Col. Sarath Jayawardane, Col. [[Vijaya Wimalaratne]] and Brig. Gen. [[Denzil Kobbekaduwa]].

In July 1987 the LTTE carried out their first suicide attack. [[Captain Miller]] of the [[Black Tigers]] drove a small truck carrying explosives through the wall of a fortified Sri Lankan army camp, reportedly killing 40 soldiers. The LTTE carried out over 378 [[suicide attack]]s, one of the largest suicide campaigns in the world, and the suicide attack became a trademark of the LTTE and a characteristic of the civil war.&lt;ref name="rep" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://storage.paxchristi.net/AP29E97.pdf#search=%22Fr.%20Mary%20Bastian%20%22|title= Speaking truth to power:the human rights situation in Sri Lanka|accessdate=26 March 2006 |work=Paxchristi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian involvement==
{{Politics of Sri Lanka}}
{{See also|Indian intervention in the Sri Lankan Civil War|Research and Analysis Wing}}
India became involved in the conflict in the 1980s for a number of reasons, including its leaders' desire to project India as the regional power in the area and worries about India's own Tamils seeking independence. Involvement was particularly strong in the Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]], where ethnic kinship led to strong support for the independence of Sri Lankan Tamils. Throughout the conflict the Indian central and state governments supported both sides in different ways. From August 1983 until May 1987 the Indian government, through its intelligence agency [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (RAW), provided arms, training and monetary support to six Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups including LTTE, [[Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization]] (TELO), [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam]] (PLOTE), [[Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students]] (EROS) [[Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front]] (EPRLF) and [[Tamil Eelam Liberation Army]] (TELA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tamilnation.co/intframe/india/jaincommission/growth_of_tamil_militancy/ch1sec2.html| title=Circumstances which led to the arming and training of SLT militants | work = Jain Commission |publisher = Tamil nation | accessdate= 19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; LTTE's rise is widely attributed to the initial backing it received from RAW. It is believed that by supporting different militant groups, the Indian government hoped to keep the Tamil independence movement divided and be able to exert overt control over it.&lt;ref name="at1"&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = Asia Times Online | url = http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/FC26Df04.html | title = Who's behind the LTTE split?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India became more actively involved in the late 1980s, and on 5 June 1987 the [[Indian Air Force]] [[Operation Poomalai|airdropped food parcels]] to [[Jaffna]] while it was [[Operation Liberation|under siege]] by Sri Lankan forces. At a time when the Sri Lankan government stated it was close to defeating the LTTE, India dropped 25 tons of food and medicine by parachute into areas held by the LTTE in a direct move of support to the rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9B0DE0D8173FF936A35755C0A961948260&amp;n=Top%2fNews%2fWorld%2fCountries%20and%20Territories%2fIndia | title = India airlifts aid to Tamil rebels | first = Steven R | last = Weisman | work = The New York Times| date=5 June 1987| accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations were held, and the [[Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord]] was signed on 29 July 1987 by Indian Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] and Sri Lankan President [[J. R. Jayewardene|Jayewardene]]. Under this accord the Sri Lankan government made a number of concessions to Tamil demands, including [[devolution]] of power to the [[Provinces of Sri Lanka|provinces]], a merger—subject to later referendum—of the northern and eastern provinces into a [[North Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|single province]], and official status for the Tamil language (this was enacted as the 13th Amendment to the [[Constitution of Sri Lanka]]). India agreed to establish order in the north and east through the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF) and to cease assisting Tamil insurgents. Militant groups including the LTTE, although initially reluctant, agreed to surrender their arms to the IPKF, which initially oversaw a cease-fire and a modest [[disarmament]] of the militant groups.

The signing of the Indo-Lanka Accord, so soon after J.R. Jayawardene's declaration that he would fight the Indians to the last bullet, led to unrest in the south. The arrival of the IPKF to take control of most areas in the north of the country enabled the Sri Lanka government to shift its forces to the south (in Indian aircraft) to quell the protests. This led to an [[Insurrection 1987-89|uprising]] by the [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna]] in the south, which was put down bloodily over the next two years.

While most Tamil militant groups laid down their weapons and agreed to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict, the LTTE refused to disarm its fighters.&lt;ref name="cp1"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.chinapost.com.tw/latestnews/20061228/43353.htm | title=Tamil rebels abduct 2 rivals, Sri Lankan military says | agency=[[Associated Press]] | date=12 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keen to ensure the success of the accord, the IPKF then tried to demobilize the LTTE by force and ended up in full-scale conflict with them. The three-year-long conflict was also marked by the IPKF being accused of committing various abuses by many human rights groups as well as some within the Indian media. The IPKF also soon met stiff opposition from the Tamils.&lt;ref&gt;Balasingham, Adele. (2003) ''The Will to Freedom – An Inside View of Tamil Resistance''. Fairmax Publishing, 2nd ed. {{ISBN|1-903679-03-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NorthEast Secretariat report on Human rights 1974–2004 (see Further Reading section).&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, nationalist sentiment led many Sinhalese to oppose the continued Indian presence in Sri Lanka. These led to the Sri Lankan government's call for India to quit the island, and the government allegedly entered into a secret deal with the LTTE that culminated in a cease-fire. However, the LTTE and IPKF continued to have frequent clashes. In April 1989 the [[Ranasinghe Premadasa]] government ordered the [[Sri Lanka army]] to clandestinely hand over arms consignments to the LTTE to fight the IPKF and its proxy Tamil National Army (TNA).&lt;ref name="atimesd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/DH31Df01.html| work = Asia Times | title = Chapter 55: Assassination of Athulathmudali|accessdate= 28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dissanayaka, T.D.S.A.: "War or Peace in Sri Lanka, Volume II", p. 332. Swastika, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Although casualties among the IPKF mounted, and calls for the withdrawal of the IPKF from both sides of the Sri Lankan conflict grew, Gandhi refused to remove the IPKF from Sri Lanka. However, following his defeat in Indian parliamentary elections in December 1989, new Prime Minister [[V.P. Singh]] ordered the withdrawal of the IPKF, and their last ship left Sri Lanka on 24 March 1990. The 32-month presence of the IPKF in Sri Lanka resulted in the deaths of 1200 Indian soldiers and over 5000 Sri Lankans. The cost for the Indian government was estimated at over ₹10.3 billion.&lt;ref name="para"&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-sIRxpjfd-EC&amp;dq | title = Paradise poisoned:learning about conflict, terrorism, and development from Sri Lanka's civil wars | page = 562 | year = 2005 | accessdate =19 January 2012 | isbn = 955-580-094-4 | author = John Richardson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rajiv Gandhi's assassination===
{{main article|Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi}}
Support for the LTTE in India dropped considerably in 1991, after the assassination of ex-Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] by a female suicide bomber, [[Thenmozhi Rajaratnam]]. The Indian press subsequently reported that Prabhakaran decided to eliminate Gandhi, as he considered the ex-Prime Minister to be against the Tamil liberation struggle and feared that he might re-induct the IPKF, which Prabhakaran termed the "satanic force", if he won the [[Indian general election, 1991|1991 Indian general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/jan/28rajiv3.htm| title = Prabhakaran had Rajiv killed for being 'anti-Tamil'| publisher = Rediff| date = 31 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 a court in India presided over by Special Judge V.

{{Main article|Eelam War II}}
The violence continued unabated despite the steps taken to appease Tamil sentiments, such as the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka|13th Amendment]] (enacted in November 1987). Meanwhile, the Chief Minister of the then [[North Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|North and East Provincial Council]], [[Annamalai Varadaraja Perumal|Vartharaja Perumal]], put forward a 19-point demand to resolve the ethnic crisis. He threatened if these demands were not met that the Provincial Council would go ahead with a [[unilateral declaration of independence]] of the northern and eastern provinces, as in the case of [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Rhodesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lakbimanews.lk/archvi/lakbimanews_10_10_03/special/spe4.htm|title= 18th amendment stumbling block to devolution – Vartharaja Perumal|accessdate= 20 January 2012|year= 2010|publisher= Lakbima News|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120804154359/http://www.lakbimanews.lk/archvi/lakbimanews_10_10_03/special/spe4.htm|archivedate= 4 August 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl1603/16030530.htm |title=The return of the exile |accessdate=20 January 2012 |year=1999 |publisher=Front Line |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516074425/http://www.flonnet.com/fl1603/16030530.htm |archivedate=16 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; President Premadasa moved to quickly dissolve the Council (March 1990). At the same time LTTE used terror tactics to scare Sinhalese and Muslim farmers away from the north and east of the island, and swiftly took control of a significant portion of the territory. When the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force|Indian Peace-Keeping Force]] withdrew in 1989–90, the LTTE established many government-like functions in the areas under its control. A tentative cease-fire held in 1990 as the LTTE occupied itself with destroying rival Tamil groups while the government cracked down on the JVP uprising. When both major combatants had established their power bases, they turned on each other and the cease-fire broke down.The government launched an offensive to try to retake Jaffna.

This phase of the war soon acquired the name ''Eelam War II'', and featured unprecedented brutality. On 11 June 1990 the LTTE [[1990 massacre of Sri Lankan Police officers|massacred 600 policemen]] in the [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|Eastern Province]] after they had surrendered on promises of safe-conduct. The government placed an embargo on food and medicine entering the Jaffna peninsula and the air force relentlessly bombed LTTE targets in the area. The LTTE responded by [[List of attacks attributed to the LTTE#1990|attacking Sinhalese and Muslim villages]] and massacring civilians. One of the largest civilian massacres of the war occurred when the LTTE [[Palliyagodella massacre|massacred 166 Muslim civilians at Palliyagodella]]. The government trained and armed Home Guard Muslim units, then took revenge on Tamil villages. There was also a significant massacre of Tamil civilians attributed{{by whom|date=May 2015}} to government forces, especially in the Eastern Province.

Notable international jurist [[Neelan Thiruchelvam]], in a speech at the ICES-Colombo, indicated that the appropriate investigations into [[wikt:massacre|massacres]] and [[forced disappearances|disappearances]] of civilians including many children in the [[Sathurukondan massacre|Sathurukondan]], [[Eastern University massacre|Eastern University]], [[Mylanthanai massacre|Mylanthanai]] and the mass murder and burial of school children at [[Sooriyakanda mass grave|Sooriyakanda]] were hampered by the adoption of emergency regulations which contributed to a climate of impunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icescolombo.org/Neelan/ps060994.htm Speech by Neelan Tiruchelvam at the Debate on the Emergency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208082545/http://www.icescolombo.org/Neelan/ps060994.htm |date=8 February 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Along roadsides in the north and east, burning bodies became a common sight. Throughout the country, government death squads hunted down, kidnapped or killed Sinhalese or Tamil youth suspected of sympathizing with the JVP or the LTTE, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.hrw.org/reports/1990/WR90/ASIA.BOU-11.htm#P718_161127 | title= Sri Lanka | accessdate= 7 August 2006 | year= 1990 | publisher= [[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1990 the LTTE [[Expulsion of Muslims from the Northern province by LTTE|expelled all the Muslims residing in Northern province]].

The largest battle of the war took place in July 1991, when 5,000 LTTE fighters surrounded the army's [[Elephant Pass]] base, which controlled access to the [[Jaffna Peninsula]]. More than 2,000 died on both sides in the month-long siege, before 10,000 government troops arrived to relieve the base.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 1992 another series of government offensives failed to capture Jaffna. Lt. Gen. [[Denzil Kobbekaduwa]] together with Maj. Gen. [[Vijaya Wimalaratne]] and Rear Adm. [[Mohan Jayamaha]], died on 8 August 1992 at Araly (Aeraella) point [[Jaffna]] due to a [[land mine]] blast. Their deaths badly affected military morale. The LTTE, for its part, scored a major victory when one of its suicide bombers killed Sri Lankan President [[Ranasinghe Premadasa]] in May 1993. In November 1993 the LTTE defeated the army in the [[Battle of Pooneryn]]. This attack left 532 Sri Lankan soldiers and 135 sailors either dead or [[missing in action]].&lt;ref name="rep" /&gt;

==Eelam War III==
{{Main article|Eelam War III}}
In the 1994 parliamentary elections the UNP was defeated and, amidst great hope, the [[People's Alliance (Sri Lanka)|People's Alliance]], headed by [[Chandrika Kumaratunga]], came to power on a peace platform. During the [[Sri Lankan presidential election, 1994|Presidential election campaign]] an LTTE bomb attack was carried out during a rally held at Thotalanga, [[Grandpass]], eliminated the entire top brass of UNP leadership, including its presidential candidate, [[Gamini Dissanayake]]. Kumaratunga became the president with a 62% majority. A cease-fire was agreed to in January 1995, but the ensuing negotiations proved fruitless. The LTTE broke the cease-fire and [[Bombing of SLNS Sooraya and SLNS Ranasuru|blew up two gunboats, SLNS ''Sooraya'' and SLNS ''Ranasuru'']] of the [[Sri Lanka Navy]] on 19 April, thereby beginning the next phase of the war, dubbed ''Eelam War III''.&lt;ref name="hrw2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1996/WR96/Asia-08.htm|title=SRI LANKA Human Rights Developments|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new government then pursued a policy of "war for peace". Determined to retake the key rebel stronghold of Jaffna, which was occupied by 2,000 rebels,&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60714F7385D0C778EDDA80994DD494D81|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171012061327/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/24/world/sri-lanka-says-it-has-sealed-rebel-stronghold.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 October 2017|title=Sri Lanka Says It Has Sealed Rebel Stronghold|accessdate=9 March 2007|date=24 November 1995|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; it poured troops into the peninsula in the successful [[Operation Riviresa]].

In a high-profile ceremony, Sri Lankan Defense Minister Col. [[Anuruddha Ratwatte]] raised the national flag inside the [[Jaffna Fort]] on 5 December 1995.

On 13 May 1997, 20,000 government troops tried to open a supply line through the LTTE-controlled Vanni, but failed.

As violence continued in the North, LTTE suicide and time bombs were exploded numerous times in populated city areas and public transport in the south of the country, killing hundreds of civilians. In January 1996 the LTTE carried out one of its deadliest suicide bomb attacks at the [[Central Bank Bombing|Central Bank]] in Colombo, killing 90 and injuring 1,400. In October 1997 it bombed the Sri Lankan World Trade Centre and, in January 1998, detonated a truck bomb in [[Kandy]], damaging the [[Temple of the Tooth]], one of the holiest Buddhist shrines in the world. In response to this bombing, the Sri Lankan government outlawed the LTTE and with some success pressed other governments around the world to do the same, significantly interfering with the group's fund-raising activities.

In January 1997 heavy fighting around Paranthan and the Elephant Pass complex took the lives of 223 Army troops.&lt;ref name="rep" /&gt; On 27 September 1998 the LTTE launched [[Operation Unceasing Waves II]] and, after heavy fighting, captured Kilinochchi, winning the [[1998 Battle of Kilinochchi|Battle of Kilinochchi]]. Clashes around the Kilinochchi forward defense line claimed the lives of 1206 soldiers that year.&lt;ref name="rep" /&gt; In March 1999, in Operation Rana Gosa, the government tried invading the Vanni from the south.The army made some gains, taking control of Oddusuddan (Oththan-thuduva) and Madhu, but could not dislodge the LTTE from the region. In September 1999 the LTTE [[Gonagala massacre|massacred 50 Sinhalese civilians at Gonagala]].

The LTTE returned to the offensive with [[Operation Unceasing Waves III]] on 2 November 1999. Nearly all the Vanni rapidly fell back into LTTE hands. The group launched 17 successful attacks in the region, culminating in the overrunning of the Paranthan (Puranthaenna) Chemicals Factory base and the Kurrakkan Kaddukulam (kurakkan-kaela vaeva) base.&lt;ref name="tamilnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=16249|title= Sixth anniversary of Unceasing Waves-III commemorated|accessdate=9 February 2009|date=3 November 2005|publisher=Tamilnet}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death toll amounted to 516 soldiers dead and over 4,000 injured.&lt;ref name="rep" /&gt; The rebels also advanced north towards Elephant Pass and Jaffna. The LTTE was successful in cutting all land and sea supply lines of the Sri Lankan armed forces to the south, west and north of the town of Kilinochchi. In December 1999 the LTTE attempted to assassinate President Chandrika Kumaratunga in a suicide attack at a pre-election rally. She lost her right-eye, among other injuries, but was able to defeat opposition leader [[Ranil Wickremesinghe]] in the [[Sri Lankan presidential election, 1999|Presidential election]] and was re-elected to her second term in office.&lt;ref name="tribune1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/1999/99dec23/head1.htm|title= Chandrikare-elected President|accessdate=7 August 2006|date= 23 December 1999|work=The Tribune |location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 April 2000 the Elephant Pass military complex, which had separated the Jaffna peninsula from the Vanni mainland for 17 years, fell into the hands of the LTTE, leaving 1,008 soldiers dead.&lt;ref name="rep" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/apr2000/sri-a25.shtml | title= Military debacle at Elephant Pass set to trigger political crisis in Sri Lanka | accessdate=7 August 2006 | date=25 April 2000 | publisher=World Socialist Web Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://brcslproject.gn.apc.org/slmonitor/april2000/tiger.html | title=Tigers seize Elephant Pass | accessdate=7 August 2006 | publisher=Sri Lanka Monitor | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119043408/http://brcslproject.gn.apc.org/slmonitor/april2000/tiger.html | archivedate=19 January 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The army then launched Operation Agni Kheela to take back the southern Jaffna Peninsula, but sustained losses. 

===Early peace efforts===
Exhaustion with the war was building as casualties mounted and there appeared to be no end in sight. By mid-2000 human rights groups estimated that more than one million people in Sri Lanka were [[internally displaced persons]], living in camps, homeless and struggling for survival. As a result, a significant [[peace movement]] developed in the late 1990s, with many organizations holding peace camps, conferences, trainings and peace meditations, and many other efforts to bridge the two sides at all levels. As early as February 2000 Norway was asked to mediate by both sides, and initial international diplomatic moves began to find a negotiated settlement to the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/627281.stm | title=Norway role in Sri Lanka peace plan | date=1 February 2000 | work=Susannah Price |publisher=BBC News | accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopes for peace gained ground as the LTTE declared a unilateral cease-fire in December 2000, but they cancelled it on 24 April 2001 and launched another offensive against the government. After securing a vast area formerly controlled by the military, the LTTE further advanced northwards. This advancement posed a serious threat to the Elephant Pass military complex that housed 17,000 Sri Lankan troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl1708/17080520.htm |title=Another LTTE offensive |accessdate=7 August 2006 |date=15–28 April 2000 |work=Frontline |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526111833/http://www.flonnet.com/fl1708/17080520.htm |archivedate=26 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2001 the LTTE carried out a devastating [[Bandaranaike Airport attack|suicide attack on Bandaranaike International Airport]], destroying eight of the air force's planes (two [[IAI Kfir]]s, one [[Mil Mi-17|Mil-17]], one [[Mil Mi-24|Mil-24]], three [[Hongdu JL-8|K-8 trainers]], one [[Mikoyan MiG-27|MiG-27]]) and four [[Sri Lankan Airlines]] planes (two [[Airbus]] [[Airbus A330|A330s]], one [[Airbus A340|A340]] and one [[Airbus A320|A320]]), dampening the economy and causing tourism—a vital foreign exchange earner for the government—to plummet. The impact of the attack was such that that year the [[Economy of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan economy]] recorded a negative growth for the first and only time since its independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srilanka.alloexpat.com/sri_lanka_information/economy_sri_lanka.php |title=Sri Lanka Economy |accessdate=19 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120205804/http://www.srilanka.alloexpat.com/sri_lanka_information/economy_sri_lanka.php |archive-date=20 January 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2002 Peace Process==

===Beginning of the cease-fire===
Towards the end of 2001 however, the LTTE began to declare their willingness to explore measures for a peaceful settlement to the conflict. One reason for this action may have been the fear of international pressure and the direct US support of the Sri Lankan government as part of the "war on Terror".&lt;ref name="bbct" /&gt; On the other hand, the [[covert operation]]s of the [[Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol (Sri Lanka)|Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol]] (LRRP) of Sri Lanka army had a profound impact on the Tiger command structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://groundviews.org/2011/12/21/llrc-report-reason-reform-roadmap/ | title=LLRC Report: Reason, reform, roadmap | publisher=Groundviews | date=21 December 2011 | accessdate=31 December 2011 | author=Jayatilleka, Dayan}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, [[Vaithilingam Sornalingam]] ''alias'' Shankar, who had been considered the right-hand man of LTTE leader Prabhakaran, and several other high-profile leaders were hunted down and killed by LRRP units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://transcurrents.com/tamiliana/archives/575 | title=LRRP infiltration demolishes impregnable Tiger terrain myth | publisher=TransCurrents | date=11 March 2008 | accessdate=20 January 2012 | author=D.

In the south the government was facing increasing criticism over its "war for peace" strategy, with peace nowhere in sight and the economy in tatters. After losing a no-confidence motion, President Kumaratunga was forced to dissolve parliament and call for fresh elections. The [[Sri Lankan parliamentary election, 2001|elections, held on 5 December 2001]], saw a sweeping victory for the [[United National Front (Sri Lanka)|United National Front]], led by [[Ranil Wickremasinghe]], who campaigned on a pro-peace platform and pledged to find a negotiated settlement to the conflict.

On 19 December, amidst efforts by Norway to bring the government and the Tamil Tigers to the negotiating table, the LTTE announced a 30-day cease-fire with the Sri Lankan government and pledged to halt all attacks against government forces.&lt;ref name="bbc2"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1719133.stm|title =Sri Lanka rebels announce truce|publisher=BBC News|date = 19 December 2001|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new government welcomed the move, and reciprocated it two days later, announcing a month-long cease-fire and agreeing to lift a long-standing economic [[embargo]] on rebel-held territory.&lt;ref name="bbct"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1723419.stm|title =Sri Lanka enters truce with rebels|publisher=BBC News|date = 21 December 2001|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cease-fire was by no means acceptable to everyone. Buddhist monks started burning Norwegian flags and agitated against the cease-fire and eventually went to form a political party, [[Jathika Hela Urumaya]], with extremist views.

The two sides formalized a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on 22 February 2002, and signed a permanent cease-fire agreement (CFA). Norway was named [[mediation|mediator]], and it was decided that they, together with the other Nordic countries, monitor the cease-fire through a committee of experts named the [[Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission]].&lt;ref name="bbc3"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1835737.stm|title =Sri Lanka seals truce deal|publisher=BBC News |date= 22 February 2002 |accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August the government agreed to lift the ban on the LTTE and paved the way for the resumption of direct negotiations with them.&lt;ref name="bbc4"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/2217189.stm|title =Colombo lifts ban on Tamil Tigers|publisher=BBC News|date = 26 August 2002|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sea Tiger Fast Attack boat.jpg|thumb|left|LTTE Sea Tiger boat patrolling during the peace]]

Following the signing of the ceasefire agreement, commercial air flights to Jaffna began and the LTTE opened the key A9 highway, which linked the government-controlled area in the south with Jaffna and ran through LTTE territory, allowing civilian traffic through the Vanni region for the first time in many years (but only after paying a tax to the LTTE). Many foreign countries also offered substantial financial support if peace was achieved and optimism grew that an end to the decades-long conflict was in sight.

The much-anticipated peace talks began in [[Phuket Province|Phuket]], Thailand, and further rounds followed in Thailand, Norway, Germany and Japan.&lt;ref name="bbc5"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/2260047.stm|title=Upbeat opening for Sri Lanka talks |publisher=BBC News | date=16 September 2002 | accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the talks both sides agreed to the principle of a federal solution and the Tigers dropped their long-standing demand for a separate state. This was a major compromise on the part of the LTTE, which had always insisted on an independent Tamil state. This also represented a compromise on the part of the government, which had seldom agreed to more than minimal devolution. Both sides also exchanged prisoners of war for the first time.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;''BBC News'', " [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/country_profiles/1166237.stm Timeline: Sri Lanka]".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political changes in the South===
Following the elections of 2001, for the first time in Sri Lanka's history the President and Prime Minister were of two different parties. This co-habitation was uneasy, especially since Prime Minister Wickremasinghe and the UNP favored a federal solution to the conflict, while hard-line elements within President Kumaratunga's party and other Sinhala nationalist groups allied to her opposed one, as they did not trust the LTTE, which continued to levy taxes, strengthen itself by smuggling in arms and ammunition, recruit child soldiers and engage in killings of members of rival Tamil groups and government intelligence agents following the [[Millennium City incident]]. During this time the LTTE also succeeded in setting up a series of vital bases around the [[Trincomalee Harbour]] (''i.e.'', Manirasakulam camp) and the Eastern Province.

The talks broke down on 21 April 2003 when the Tamil Tigers announced they were suspending any further talks due to their "displeasure" at the handling of some "critical issues". Among the reasons the Tigers gave were their exclusion from reconstruction talks in Washington, DC, on 14 April and a more general insinuation that they were not receiving the full economic rewards of peace. They cited the failure, as they saw it, of peace dividends to transfer to security withdrawals on the ground and the disparity, as they saw it, between the relative calm of the government-held northeast and continuing violence in Tiger-held areas. However, the LTTE maintained it was committed to a settlement to the two-decade conflict, but stated that progress had to be made on the ground before the settlement proceeded.&lt;ref name="bbc6"&gt;{{cite news|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/2964349.stm|title =Tamil Tigers call off peace talks|publisher=BBC News|date = 21 April 2003|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 October the LTTE issued its own peace proposal, calling for an ''[[Interim Self Governing Authority]]'' (ISGA). The ISGA would be fully controlled by the LTTE and would have broad powers in the north and east (see the [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3232913.stm full text of the proposals]) This provoked a strong backlash among the hard-line elements in the south, who accused Prime Minister Wickremasinghe of handing the north and east to the LTTE. Under pressure from within her own party to take action, Kumaratunga declared a state of emergency and took three key government ministries, the Ministry of Mass Media, the Interior Ministry and the crucial Defense Ministry.&lt;ref name="bbc7"&gt;{{cite news|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3239303.stm|title =Sri Lanka thrown into political crisis|publisher=BBC News|date = 4 November 2003|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then formed an alliance with the JVP, called the [[United People's Freedom Alliance]], opposed to the ISGA and advocating a harder line on the LTTE, and called for fresh elections. The [[Sri Lankan parliamentary election, 2004|elections]], held on 8 April 2004, resulted in victory for the [[United People's Freedom Alliance|UPFA]] with [[Mahinda Rajapakse]] appointed as Prime Minister.

===Split of the LTTE===
Meanwhile, in March 2004 there had been a major split between the northern and eastern wings of the LTTE. [[Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan]] ''alias'' Col. Karuna, the Eastern commander of the LTTE and one of Prabhakaran's trusted lieutenants, pulled 5,000 eastern cadres out of the LTTE, claiming insufficient resources and power were being given to Tamils of the eastern part of the island. It was the biggest expression of dissension in the history of the LTTE and a clash within the LTTE seemed imminent. After the parliamentary elections, brief fighting south of Trincomalee led to a rapid retreat and capitulation of Karuna's group, their leaders eventually going into hiding including Karuna himself, who was helped to escape by [[Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana]], a politician from the ruling party. However, the "Karuna faction" maintained a significant presence in the east and continued to launch attacks against the LTTE.&lt;ref name="nyt2"&gt;{{cite news|url =https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/world/asia/31lanka.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|title =Sri Lanka Says Rebels Took Losses in Raids|work=The New York Times|date = 31 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LTTE accused the army of covertly backing the breakaway group, which subsequently formed a political party named the [[TamilEela Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal]] (TMVP) and hope to contest in future elections.

The cease-fire largely held through all this turmoil, with over 3000 infractions by the LTTE and some 300 by the SLA recorded by the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) by 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Lanka peace secretariat report, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The situation was further complicated by allegations that both sides were carrying out covert operations against each other. The government claimed that the LTTE was killing political opponents, recruiting children, importing arms and killing government security and intelligence officers. The rebels accused the government of supporting paramilitary groups against them, especially the Karuna group.

===Tsunami and aftermath===
On 26 December 2004, the [[Indian Ocean tsunami]] struck Sri Lanka, killing more than 35,000 people and leaving many more homeless. A great deal of aid arrived from around the world, but there was immediate disagreement over how it should be distributed to the Tamil regions under LTTE control. By 24 June the government and LTTE agreed on the Post-Tsunami Operational Management Structure (P-TOMS), but it received sharp criticism from the [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna|JVP]], who left the government in protest. The legality of P-TOMS was also challenged in the courts. President Kumaratunga eventually had to scrap P-TOMS, which led to widespread criticism that sufficient aid was not reaching the north and east of the country. However, immediately following the tsunami there was a marked decrease in violence in the north.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Sri Lankan Foreign Minister [[Lakshman Kadirgamar]], a Tamil who was highly respected by foreign diplomats and who had been sharply critical of the LTTE, was assassinated at his home on 12 August 2005, allegedly by an LTTE sniper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4147196.stm | title=Senior Sri Lanka minister killed | accessdate=13 August 2005 |publisher=BBC News | date=13 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; His assassination led to the marginalization of the LTTE from the international community, and is generally considered to be the moment when the LTTE lost much of its sympathy in the eyes of foreign nations. Hence the silence of the international community when the Sri Lankan government took military action against the LTTE in 2006, when the latter closed the Mavil aru sluice.{{elucidate|date=July 2012}}

Further political change occurred when the [[Supreme Court of Sri Lanka]] declared President Kumaratunga's second and final term over and ordered her to hold fresh presidential elections. The main candidates for the [[Sri Lankan presidential election, 2005|election]], which was held in November, were UNF candidate former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe, who advocated the reopening of talks with the LTTE, and the UPFA candidate Prime Minister Rajapaksa, who called for a tougher line against the LTTE and a renegotiation of the cease-fire. The LTTE openly called for a [[boycott]] of the election by Tamils. Many of them were expected to vote for Wickremasinghe, and the loss of their votes proved fatal to his chances, as Rajapakse achieved a narrow victory. Following the election, LTTE leader [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]] stated in his annual address that the Tigers would "renew their struggle" in 2006 if the government did not take serious moves toward peace.

==Resumption of hostilities==
[[File:Extent of territorial control in sri lanka.png|thumb|Red area shows the approximate areas of Sri Lanka controlled by the LTTE and the Government, as of December 2005.]]
{{Main article|Eelam War IV}}
Beginning in December 2005, there was increased guerrilla activity to the northeast, including [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore mine]] attacks which killed 150 government troops,&lt;ref name="st1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/060430/index.html|title=How President decided on retaliation|work=The Sunday Times |date=30 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; clashes between the [[Sea Tigers]] and the Sri Lanka navy and the killings of sympathizers on both sides including [[Taraki Sivaram]], a pro-LTTE journalist, and [[Joseph Pararajasingham]], a pro-LTTE MP, both killed allegedly by the government of Sri Lanka.

At the beginning of 2006 the focus of the civil war turned to civilian targets, with commuter bus and train bombings carried out in most parts of the country, including a series of attacks against commuters in and around Colombo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7440183.stm|title=Sri Lanka's war turns on civilians|publisher=BBC News|date=6 June 2008|accessdate=4 January 2010|first=Frances|last=Harrison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Talks and further violence===
In light of this violence, the co-chairs of the Tokyo Donor conference called on both parties to return to the negotiating table. [[US State Department]] officials gave warnings to the Tigers, stating that a return to hostilities would mean that the Tigers would face a "more capable and more determined" Sri Lankan military.&lt;ref name="ind1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article338232.ece |title=Sri Lanka bomb attack fuels fear of return to civil war |work=The Independent |date=13 January 2006 |location=London |first=Justin |last=Huggler |accessdate=9 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110153720/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article338232.ece |archivedate=10 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the talks were going on there was violence directed towards civilians, such as [[2006 Trincomalee massacre|the killings of five Tamil students]] on 2 January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nation.lk/2006/07/23/newsfe3.htm|title=Is the State complacent?|accessdate=30 January 2007 |work=The Nation |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930224026/http://www.nation.lk/2006/07/23/newsfe3.htm |archivedate = 30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrchk.net/statements/mainfile.php/2006statements/612/|title='Murder of five Tamil youths highlights need to end impunity' – Govt must protect witnesses to Trinco killings – Human Rights Watch|accessdate=30 January 2007 |publisher=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a last-minute effort to salvage an agreement between the parties, Norwegian special envoy [[Erik Solheim]] and LTTE theoretician Anton Balasingham arrived on the island. The parties strongly disagreed on the location of the talks; however, continued efforts produced a breakthrough when both parties agreed on 7 February 2006 that new talks could be held in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, on 22 and 23 February. During the weeks after the talks there was a significant decrease in violence. However, the LTTE resumed attacks against the military in April.

In light of this violence, the LTTE called for a postponement of the Geneva talks until 24–25 April, and the government initially agreed to this. Following negotiations, both the government and the rebels agreed to have a civilian vessel transport regional LTTE leaders with international truce monitors on 16 April, which involved crossing government-controlled territory. However, the climate shifted drastically when the Tigers cancelled the meeting, claiming not to have agreed to a naval escort. According to the SLMM, the Tamil rebels had previously agreed to the escort.&lt;ref name="bbc8"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4911554.stm|title = Tamil Tigers harden talks stance|publisher=BBC News| date = 17 April 2006|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 2006 the LTTE officially pulled out of peace talks indefinitely. While they stated that transportation issues had prevented them from meeting their regional leaders, some analysts and the international community were strongly skeptical, seeing the transportation issue as a delaying tactic by the LTTE to avoid attending peace talks in Geneva.&lt;ref name="bbc9"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2006/04/printable/060423_eu_ban.shtml|title = EU ban on LTTE urged|publisher=BBC News|date = 23 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence continued to spiral and on 23 April 2006, [[Gomarankadawala massacre|six Sinhalese rice farmers were massacred]] in their paddy fields by suspected LTTE cadres,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2006/04/30/fea13.html|title=LTTE carnage at Gomarankadawala:Its significance|publisher=Sunday Obsrver|date=30 April 2006|accessdate=21 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905181758/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2006/04/30/fea13.html|archivedate=5 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 13 May 2006 [[Allaipiddy massacre|13 Tamil civilians were killed]] in the [[List of islands of Sri Lanka#Northern Province|islet of Kayts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first = Dumeetha|last = Luthra|title = Sri Lanka villagers flee massacre|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5000920.stm|publisher=BBC|date=20 May 2006|accessdate=16 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; International condemnation against the LTTE skyrocketed following the attempted assassination of the commander of the Sri Lanka Army, Lt. Gen. [[Sarath Fonseka]], by a female LTTE [[Black Tigers|Black Tiger]] [[suicide bomber]] named Anoja Kugenthirasah, who concealed the explosives by appearing to be pregnant and blew herself up at army headquarters in [[Colombo]]. For the first time since the 2001 cease-fire, the Sri Lanka Air Force carried out aerial assaults on rebel positions in the northeastern part of the island in retaliation for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4941744.stm |title=Bomb targets Sri Lanka army chief|publisher=BBC News|date=25 April 2006|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This attack, along with the assassination of Lakshman Kadiragamar a year earlier and an unsuccessful attack against a naval vessel carrying 710 unarmed security force personnel on holiday, marked a turning point, as the [[European Union]] decided to proscribe the LTTE as a terrorist organisation on 19 May 2006. It resulted in the freezing of LTTE assets in its 27 member nations. In a statement, the [[European Parliament]] said that the LTTE did not represent all the Tamils and called on it to "allow for political pluralism and alternate democratic voices in the northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka".&lt;ref name="hindu1"&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.hindu.com/2006/05/31/stories/2006053117200100.htm| title=European Union bans LTTE| work=Amit Baruah|date = 31 May 2006|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the north and east of the country continued to be rocked by attacks, new talks were scheduled in Oslo, Norway, between 8–9 June. Delegations from both sides arrived in Oslo, but the talks were cancelled when the LTTE refused to meet directly with the government delegation, claiming its fighters were not allowed safe passage to travel to the talks. Norwegian mediator Erik Solheim told journalists that the LTTE should take direct responsibility for the collapse of the talks.&lt;ref name="bbc10"&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2006/06/060609_saroj-oslo.shtml|title=Collapse of talks|work =Saroj Pathirana|publisher=BBC News|date = 9 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further violence followed, including the [[Vankalai massacre]]. The Sri Lankan army and [[Tamil Tiger]] rebels blamed each other for the killings.&lt;ref name="AN"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=6425|title = People terrorized after massacre of Tamil family| publisher =AsiaSat News|date =13 June 2006|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs06/sri_lanka_021106.doc |title=Country of origin information report– Sri Lanka |accessdate=22 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325153828/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs06/sri_lanka_021106.doc |archivedate=25 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the [[Kebithigollewa massacre]] in which the LTTE attacked a bus, killing at least 64 Sinhalese civilians and prompting more air strikes by the Air Force,&lt;ref name="usinfo1"&gt;''United States International Information Programs''", [http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2006/June/20060615115032ndyblehs0.351742.html United States Condemns Terrorist Attack on Sri Lankan Bus]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202201603/http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2006/June/20060615115032ndyblehs0.351742.html |date=2 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the assassination of Sri Lanka's third highest-ranking army officer and Deputy Chief of Staff [[Parami Kulatunga|General Parami Kulatunga]] on 26 June by an LTTE suicide bomber.&lt;ref name="bbc11"&gt;{{cite news|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5115968.stm| title=Sri Lanka general killed in blast|publisher=BBC News|date = 26 June 2006|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events led the [[Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission|SLMM]] to question whether a cease-fire could still be said to exist.&lt;ref name="slmm1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slmm.lk/intros/press_releases.htm|title=Press releases|accessdate=7 August 2006|publisher=Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312223248/http://www.slmm.lk/intros/press_releases.htm|archivedate=12 March 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mavil Aru water dispute===
A new crisis leading to the first large-scale fighting since signing of the cease-fire occurred when the LTTE closed the [[sluice gate]]s of the [[Mavil Aru]] reservoir on 21 July. Mavil Aru was the waterway that provided water to some regions of eastern Sri Lanka, like [[Trincomalee]]. After the cease-fire in 2002, the conflict over Mavil Aru was one of the biggest military confrontations between the [[Sri Lanka Armed Forces]] and the LTTE. Its relevance is for geo-strategic reasons: within the Mavil Aru area, Sinhala, Muslim and Tamil populations live side by side. It is also the entrance to Koddiyar Bay, the inlet for Trincomalee port and naval base, so the LTTE presence in the area seriously threatened the Sri Lankan security forices' presence and domination.

Closure of Mavil Aru affected the water supply to 15,000 families in government-controlled areas.&lt;ref name="bbc12"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5249884.stm|title = Sri Lanka forces attack reservoir|publisher=BBC News|date=6 August 2006|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the initial negotiations and efforts by the SLMM to open the gates failed, the Sri Lanka military initiated an operation to achieve the re-opening of the sluice gates.

President Rajapaksa said that the supply of water was a non-negotiable fundamental human right. Additionally, a government spokesman said that "''utilities could not be used as bargaining tools''" by the rebels.&lt;ref name="bbc12" /&gt; The government deployed its army and air force for the offensive, attacking not only the region of [[Mavil Aru]] but also the LTTE positions in [[Batticaloa]], and [[Vavuniya]]. Air Force planes attacked LTTE positions on 26 July, and ground troops began an operation to open the gate.&lt;ref name="south"/&gt; The sluice gates were eventually reopened on 8 August, with conflicting reports as to who actually opened them. Initially, the SLMM claimed that they managed to persuade the LTTE to lift the waterway blockade conditionally.&lt;ref name="nation.lk"/&gt; The LTTE claimed that it opened the sluice gates "on humanitarian grounds", although this was disputed by military correspondents, who stated the water began flowing immediately after security forces carried out a precise bombing of the Mavil Aru anicut.&lt;ref name="st2"&gt;''The Sunday Times Situation Report'', [http://sundaytimes.lk/060813/index.html Eelam war IV rages on several fronts].&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, following heavy fighting, government troops gained full control of the Mavil Aru reservoir on 15 August.&lt;ref name="nation.lk"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nation.lk/2009/05/19/news19.html | title=Operation Liberation | work=[[The Nation (Sri Lanka)|The Nation]] | date=19 May 2009 | accessdate=29 April 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330213340/http://www.nation.lk/2009/05/19/news19.html | archive-date=30 March 2010 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequences of the "Operation Watershed" were about 150 civilians killed and more than 50,000 refugees from [[Mutur]] and the villages nearby.

===LTTE offensives in Muttur and Jaffna===
As fierce fighting was ongoing in the vicinity of Mavil Aru, violence spread to Trincomalee, where the LTTE launched an attack on a crucial Sri Lanka Navy base,&lt;ref name="south2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.southasiaanalysis.org/%5Cnotes4%5Cnote325.html |title=LTTE strikes back – Update No. 98 |publisher=southasiaanalysis.org |date=15 August 2006 |accessdate=29 April 2012 |author=Hariharan, R. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128160927/http://southasiaanalysis.org/notes4/note325.html |archivedate=28 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the strategic government-controlled coastal town of Muttur in early August, resulting in the deaths of at least 30 civilians and displacing 25,000 residents of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5240864.stm |title = Civilians die in Sri Lanka clash |publisher=BBC News |date = 3 August 2006|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clashes erupted on 2 August 2006 when the LTTE launched a heavy artillery attack on Muttur&lt;ref name="toi1"&gt;{{cite news |url =http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1859354.cms |title = 152 LTTE rebels killed in Sri Lanka |work=The Times of India  |date = 4 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then moved in, gaining control of some parts of the town.&lt;ref name="hindu2"&gt;{{cite news |url =http://www.hindu.com/2006/08/04/stories/2006080408511500.htm |title=34 killed as LTTE `overruns' Muttur town |work=B.

Soon afterwards, 17 persons working for the International French charity [[Action Against Hunger]] (ACF) in Muthur, [[2006 Trincomalee massacre of NGO workers|were massacred]]. They were found lying face down on the floor of their office, shot to death, still wearing their clearly marked T-shirts indicating they were international humanitarian workers. The murders prompted widespread international condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.hindu.com/2006/08/08/stories/2006080808521200.htm |title=15 NGO workers killed |accessdate=30 January 2007 |work=The Hindu  |location=Chennai, India |date=8 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SLMM claimed that the government was behind the attack,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5298470.stm |title = Military 'killed Lanka aid staff' |publisher=BBC |date = 30 August 2006|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the government denied the allegation calling it "pathetic and biased", and stated that the SLMM had "no right to make such a statement because they are not professionals in autopsy or post-mortem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5298470.stm|title = Sri Lanka forces attack reservoir|publisher=BBC News|date=6 August 2006|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in the north of the country, some of the bloodiest fighting since 2001 took place after the LTTE launched massive attacks on [[Sri Lanka Army]] defense lines on the Jaffna peninsula on 11 August. The LTTE used a force of 400–500 fighters in the attacks, which consisted of land and amphibious assaults, and also fired a barrage of artillery at government positions, including the key military airbase at [[Palaly Military Base|Palaly]].&lt;ref name="south2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oi1"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.oneindia.in/2006/08/12/sri-lanka-rebels-say-destroy-northern-defences-advance-1155353635.html|title = Lanka rebels destroy northern defenses, advance |publisher = One India| date = 12 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LTTE is estimated to have lost over 200 fighters in the operation, while 90 Sri Lankan soldiers and sailors were also killed.&lt;ref name="usatoday1"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-08-15-sri-lanka_x.htm|title = Fighting rages in northern Sri Lanka in fourth week of hostilities |work=USA Today| date = 15 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As ground battles were ongoing in the north and the east of the country, the Sri Lanka Air Force carried out an air strike against a facility in the rebel-held Mullaitivu area, [[Chencholai airstrike|killing a number of Tamil girls]]. Although the LTTE claimed 61 girls were killed, the SLMM stated they were able to count just 19 bodies.&lt;ref name="hind"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/08/15/stories/2006081512460100.htm | title=Suicide attack in Colombo |work=The Hindu  | date=15 August 2006 | accessdate=29 April 2012 | author=Reddy, B.

On the same day a convoy carrying the Pakistani [[High Commissioner]] to Sri Lanka, Bashir Wali Mohamed, was [[Attack on Pakistani ambassador to Sri lanka|attacked]] when a [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|claymore antipersonnel mine]] concealed within an [[auto rickshaw]] blew up as it passed by.

===Fall of Sampur===
Since the resumption of violence, concerns were mounting among the military establishment that the strategically crucial&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=COL24804|title = Sri Lanka army battles rebels in northeast|work = Peter Apps|agency = Reuters|date = 12 September 2006|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060903184404/http://today.reuters.co.uk/News/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=COL24804|archivedate = 3 September 2006|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sri Lanka Navy base in Trincomalee was under severe threat from LTTE gun positions located in and around Sampur, which lies across the Koddiyar Bay from Trincomalee.&lt;ref name="hindu4"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.hindu.com/2006/09/05/stories/2006090505251300.htm|title = Sri Lankan army captures Sampur|work = The Hindu |date = 5 September 2006 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artillery fired from LTTE bases in the area could potentially cripple the naval base, bringing it to a complete standstill and cutting the only military supply chain to Jaffna. All movements of naval vessels were also under the constant surveillance of the LTTE.&lt;ref name="south3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southasiaanalysis.org/%5Cnotes4%5Cnote331.html |title=Sri Lanka: LTTE's moment of truth at Sampur – Update 101 |publisher=southasiaanalysis.org |date=8 September 2006 |accessdate=29 April 2012 |author=Hariharan, R. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128074835/http://southasiaanalysis.org/notes4/note331.html |archivedate=28 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These fears were backed up by a US military advisory team which visited the island in 2005.

Following clashes in Mavil Aru and Muttur, the LTTE had intensified attacks targeting the naval base in Trincomalee,&lt;ref name="hindu4" /&gt; and in a speech on 21 August Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapakse made clear the government intentions were to neutralize the LTTE threat from Sampur.&lt;ref name="hindu4" /&gt; On 28 August the military launched an assault to retake the LTTE camps in Sampur and the adjoining Kaddaiparichchan and Thoppur areas. This led the LTTE to declare that if the offensive continued, the cease-fire would be officially over.

After steady progress, security forces led by Brigade Commander Sarath Wijesinghe&lt;ref name="hindu5" /&gt; recaptured Sampur from the LTTE on 4 September and began to establish military bases there,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&amp;sid=ax6hzULkWuCE|title = Sri Lanka Army captures Sampur|publisher = Bloomberg|date = 4 September 2006|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930045935/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&amp;sid=ax6hzULkWuCE|archivedate = 30 September 2007|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the LTTE admitted defeat and stated their fighters "withdrew" from the strategically important town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2006/09/060904_sampoor_defeat.shtml| title = LTTE admits defeat in Sampoor|publisher=BBC |date = 4 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It marked the first significant territorial change of hands since the signing of the cease-fire agreement in 2002.&lt;ref name="iht1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/04/asia/AS_GEN_Sri_Lanka.php |title=Sri Lankan military captures key rebel territory, Tigers vow to keep fighting |work=International Herald Tribune |date=3 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629120955/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/04/asia/AS_GEN_Sri_Lanka.php |archivedate=29 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sri Lankan military estimated that 33 of its personnel were killed in the offensive, along with over 200 LTTE fighters.&lt;ref name="hindu5"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.hindu.com/2006/09/12/stories/2006091204601400.htm|title = Fierce battles continue in Jaffna|work = The Hindu|date = 12 September 2006|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LTTE retaliation and further peace talks===
The LTTE struck back in October. First, they killed nearly 130 soldiers in a fierce battle at Muhamalai, the crossing-point between government- and LTTE-controlled area in the north of the country.&lt;ref name="sunday1"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://sundaytimes.lk/061015/Columns/sitreport.html | title=Muhamalai debacle: The shocking story | work=[[The Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)|The Sunday Times]] | date=15 October 2006 | accessdate=29 April 2012 | author=[[Iqbal Athas|Athas, Iqbal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just days later, a suspected LTTE suicide bomber [[2006 Digampathana bombing|struck a naval convoy]] in Habarana, in the center of the country, killing about 100 sailors who were returning home on leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6045866.stm| title = Analysis: Sri Lanka military setbacks|publisher=BBC |date = 16 October 2006|accessdate=4 January 2010|first=Dumeetha|last=Luthra}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the deadliest suicide attack in the history of the conflict.&lt;ref name="zaman1"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.zaman.com/?bl=international&amp;alt=&amp;hn=37451|title = Bloody Day in Sri Lanka: 103 Dead|work = Zaman Daily|date = 17 October 2006|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110511061254/http://www.zaman.com/?bl=international&amp;alt=&amp;hn=37451|archivedate = 11 May 2011|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later LTTE Sea Tiger forces launched an attack against the ''Dakshina'' naval base in the southern port city of [[Galle]]. It was the farthest south any major LTTE attack had taken place, and involved 15 LTTE fighters who arrived in five suicide boats. The attack was repulsed by the government, and the damage to the naval base was minimal. All 15 LTTE fighters were believed to have died in the attack, along with one Navy sailor.&lt;ref name="hindu6"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.hindu.com/2006/10/19/stories/2006101915420100.htm|title = LTTE attack on Galle repulsed |work =The Hindu |date=19 October 2006|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these incidents, both parties agreed to unconditionally attend peace talks in Geneva on 28–29 October.&lt;ref name="south4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southasiaanalysis.org/%5Cnotes4%5Cnote339.html |title=Sri Lanka: Contradictions of a military agenda – Update 104 |publisher=southasiaanalysis.org |date=10 October 2006 |accessdate=29 April 2012 |author=Hariharan, R. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128162842/http://southasiaanalysis.org/notes4/note339.html |archivedate=28 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the peace talks broke down due to disagreements over the reopening of the key A9 highway, which is the link between Jaffna and government-controlled areas in the south. While the LTTE wanted the highway, which was closed following fierce battles in August, to be reopened, the government refused, stating the LTTE would use it to collect taxes from people passing through and would use it to launch further offensives against government troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/10/29/europe/EU_GEN_Switzerland_Sri_Lanka_Talks.php |title=Sri Lankan peace talks end in deadlock over road blockade |work=International Herald tribune |date=28 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321013934/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/10/29/europe/EU_GEN_Switzerland_Sri_Lanka_Talks.php |archivedate=21 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the dawn of the new year, suspected [[LTTE]] fighters carried out two bus bombings in the south of the country, killing 21 civilians. News reports stated that the attacks bore all the hallmarks of an LTTE attack.&lt;ref name="an1"&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/COL157334.htm| title =Fear and loathing in south Sri Lanka after bus bombs| work =Buddhika Weerasinghe|agency = Reuters|date = 8 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sri Lankan government condemned the attacks and blamed the LTTE for carrying them out, although the LTTE denied any involvement.&lt;ref name="mcns1"&gt;''Media Center for National Security'', [http://www.nationalsecurity.lk/fullnews.php?id=3298 The Government Condemns LTTE Terror Attacks on Civilians] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223055805/http://www.nationalsecurity.lk/fullnews.php?id=3298 |date=23 February 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government offensive in the East===
{{Main article|Eastern Theater of Eelam War IV}}
{{See also|Operation Definite Victory}}
In December 2006 Sri Lankan government officials announced their plans to drive the LTTE out of the [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|Eastern Province]] of Sri Lanka, and then use the full strength of the military to defeat the LTTE in the north of the country. The government stated that LTTE was firing artillery towards civilian settlements in the east and were using 35,000 people as human shields.&lt;ref name="reuters-14 December 2006"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/COL298949.htm|title =Sri Lanka military vows to drive Tigers from east coast| agency = Reuters|date = 14 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims were later backed up by civilians in the area, who told reporters that they were held by force by the Tamil Tigers.&lt;ref name="iht-18 December 2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/18/asia/AS_GEN_Sri_Lanka_Refugees.php |title=Fleeing Tamil refugees describe being held by separatists as Sri Lanka shelled camps |work=International Herald Tribune |date=18 December 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205184839/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/18/asia/AS_GEN_Sri_Lanka_Refugees.php |archivedate=5 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 November 2006, amidst conflicting claims, over 45 Tamil civilians were killed in what is known as the [[Vaharai bombing]].

Subsequently, the army began an offensive against the LTTE on 8 December 2006, in the Batticoloa district with the objective of taking [[Vakarai (Sri Lanka)|Vakarai]], the principal stronghold of the LTTE in the east; the operation was temporarily aborted after a week of fighting due to the large number of civilians in the area and the difficulty in conducting combat operations due to the ongoing [[monsoon]] rain.&lt;ref name="uthr1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uthr.org/bulletins/Bul45.htm#_Toc162720341 | title=Flight to Vaharai | publisher=UTHR | accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few weeks an estimated 20,000 civilians fled from [[Vakarai]] to government-controlled areas, fearing the imminent assault. The army launched a new offensive in mid-January, and Vakarai fell to the advancing troops on 19 January. While the offensive in the East was ongoing, the LTTE and others accused the government of murdering 15 civilians in the [[Padahuthurai bombing]] on 2 January, when the air force bombed what they claimed to be an [[LTTE]] naval base in Illuppaikadavai in northern Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="trib1"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.asiantribune.com/index.php?q=node/3962 | title=Sri Lanka: Mystery shrouds over the killing of civilians in Mannar | work=[[Asian Tribune]] | date=3 January 2007 | accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slmm.lk/press_releases/statement%20-%20air%20strike.pdf|format=PDF|title=Press release on 29 April 2006 SUBJECT: Air strikes violate the Ceasefire Agreement|accessdate=2 March 2007|work=SLMM|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625102927/http://www.slmm.lk/press_releases/statement%20-%20air%20strike.pdf|archivedate=25 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of Vakarai had been predicted to cut off supply routes of the northern Tigers to their cadres in the east, thus weakening the Tigers' already diminishing grip on the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asiantribune.com/index.php?q=node/4211|title=Tigers admit fall of Vakarai |work = Asian Tribune| date = 20 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.asiantribune.com/index.php?q=node/4208|title =Sri Lanka Security forces captured LTTE controlled Vaharai|work = Asian Tribune| date = 19 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government offensive in the North==
{{Main article|2008–2009 SLA Northern offensive}}

Sporadic fighting in the North had been going on for months, but the intensity of the clashes increased after September 2007. During clashes in the Forward Defence Lines, separating their forces, both sides exchanged heavy artillery fire, after which military incursions followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7046629.stm|title=Sri Lanka on brink of all-out war|publisher=BBC News|date=16 October 2007|accessdate=31 December 2007|first=Ethirajan|last=Anbarasan}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2007, the LTTE defences at Uyilankulama, Parappakandal and Thampanai were lost to advancing troops of the Sri Lanka Army.&lt;ref name="mod-ma-22 December 2007"&gt;{{cite news|title =LTTE defences in Mannar and Vavuniya fall to army; terrorists on the run with soaring casualties|date =22 December 2007|url =http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20071222_08|work =Ministry of Defence|accessdate =31 December 2007|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071225110603/http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20071222_08|archivedate =25 December 2007|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the ''[[Sunday Observer]]'' the Army Commander Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka said that the Army had occupied the LTTE's Forward Defence Lines and surrounded the Wanni LTTE bases from all directions. He also said that there were around 3,000 Tigers remaining and that the military intended to annihilate them within the first six months of the next year.&lt;ref name="mod-no-30 December 2007"&gt;{{cite news|title =Wanni is surrounded on all prongs|date =30 December 2007|url =http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20071230_05|work =Ministry of Defence|accessdate =31 December 2007|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080101155601/http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20071230_05|archivedate =1 January 2008|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day later there were less optimistic statements by Army, Air Force and Navy Commanders. The Army was to face an estimated 5,000 Tiger cadres in the Wanni. The Commander of the Army intended to shift the current battles in the Forward Defence Lines to a decisive phase in August 2008. In the Commanders' view, it was quite possible to defeat the LTTE in 2008.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2b"&gt;{{cite news |title= Forces' Chiefs predict Tiger extinction in 2008 |date= 31 December 2007 |url= http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20071231_01 |work= www.defence.lk |agency= Ministry of Defence |accessdate= 31 December 2007 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080101155611/http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20071231_01 |archivedate= 1 January 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the situation of more than 200,000 civilians who had been displaced in the latest round of fighting was turning into a humanitarian disaster; however, due to a number of reasons including doubts regarding the sincerity of the LTTE's negotiations, neither Western governments nor India intervened to broker a new ceasefire.&lt;ref name="mod-bbc-10/17/08-2"&gt;{{cite news|title=West urged not to ignore Sri Lanka|date=17 October 2008|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7676839.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate =18 October 2008|first=Ethirajan|last=Anbarasan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fall of Kilinochchi and subsequent events===
{{Main article|Battle of Kilinochchi (2008–2009)}}

The Sri Lankan Army began the attack on Kilinochchi on 23 November 2008. Troops were attacking rebels' defences from three directions.&lt;ref name="mod-bbc-24 November 2008"&gt;{{cite news|title=S Lanka attack on rebel 'capital'|date=24 November 2008|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7745162.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate =24 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the LTTE offered a stiff resistance, and the prolonged attack resulted in heavy casualties on both sides.&lt;ref name="mod-bbc-17 December 2008"&gt;{{cite news|title='Many dead' in Sri Lanka battles|date=17 December 2008|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7786183.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate =26 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not until 1 January 2009 were SLA troops able to capture [[Paranthan]], located to the north of Kilinochchi along the A-9 route. This isolated the southern periphery of the [[Elephant Pass]] LTTE foothold and also exposed the LTTE's main fortification at Kilinochchi.&lt;ref name="mod-ki-1 January 2009"&gt;{{cite news|title =Paranthan LTTE garrison captured: Troops make headway at Wanni battles|date =1 January 2009|url =http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20090101_01|work =Ministry of Defence|accessdate =6 January 2009|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110510103220/http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20090101_01|archivedate =10 May 2011|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made the capture of Kilinochchi, which the rebels had used for over a decade as their de facto administrative capital, far simpler, and they were able to accomplish this on 2 January. The loss of Killinochchi caused a substantial dent in the LTTE's image as a capable, ruthless terrorist group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-01/03/content_10596928.htm |title=The fall of rebel headquarters: what does it hold for Sri Lanka? |agency=Xinhua News Agency |date=3 January 2009 |accessdate=17 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604103501/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-01/03/content_10596928.htm |archivedate=4 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and observers forecast the LTTE was likely to collapse before long under unbearable military pressure on multiple fronts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.island.lk/2009/01/03/editorial.html A blow to global terror].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tigers quickly abandoned their positions on the Jaffna peninsula to make a last stand in the jungles of [[Mullaitivu]], their last main base.&lt;ref name="mod-bbc-01/08/09"&gt;{{cite news|title=Army 'takes more Tiger territory'|date=8 January 2009|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7817110.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate =8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire Jaffna peninsula was captured by the Sri Lanka Army by 14 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601091&amp;sid=aehebYR1I8gI&amp;refer=india |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120721035858/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601091&amp;sid=aehebYR1I8gI&amp;refer=india |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 July 2012 |title=Sri Lankan Military Seizes Last Rebel Base on Jaffna Peninsula |publisher=Bloomberg |date=14 January 2009 |accessdate=17 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were unable to hold out for long, and on 25 January, SLA troops captured Mullaitivu.&lt;ref name="mod-bbc-25 January 2009"&gt;{{cite news|title=Last Tamil Tiger bastion 'taken'|date=25 January 2009|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7849684.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate =25 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes 2009/01/26"&gt;{{cite news|author = Somini Sepgupta |title = Sri Lankan Troops Take Last Rebel Stronghold |date = 26 January 2009 |work=The New York Times |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/world/asia/26lanka.html?hp |accessdate =26 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last Sea Tiger base in Chalai was next to fall on 5 February, reducing the territory under rebel control to less than some 200&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="mod-mu-02/05/09"&gt;{{cite news|title =Army captures last sea tiger base &amp; clears entire Visuamadu area|date =5 February 2009|url =http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20090205_08|work =Ministry of Defence|accessdate =5 February 2009|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090227182635/http://defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20090205_08|archivedate =27 February 2009|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This stage of the war was marked by increased brutality against civilians and rapidly mounting civilian casualties. On 19 February 2009, [[Human Rights Watch]] issued a report accusing the Sri Lankan army of "slaughtering" the civilians during indiscriminate artillery attacks (including repeated shelling of hospitals) and calling on the Sri Lankan government to end its policy of "detaining displaced persons" in military-controlled internment camps. Human Rights Watch also urged the Tamil Tigers to permit trapped civilians to leave the war zone and to "stop shooting at those who try to flee".&lt;ref name="hrw-19 February 2008"&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/srilanka0209webwcover_0.pdf War on the Displaced: Sri Lankan Army and LTTE Abuses against Civilians in the Vanni], Human Rights Watch. 19 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The UN was also concerned over the condition of internally displaced persons and estimated that some 200,000 people were being squeezed into a narrow 14&amp;nbsp;square kilometre patch of land on the coast in Vanni, which the government had declared the 'no-fire zone'.&lt;ref name="un-27 February 2008"&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=30046&amp;Cr=sri+lanka&amp;Cr1= War UN relief chief concerned over physical condition of Sri Lankans trapped by clashes], United Nations. 27 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 February 2009, two LTTE planes on [[2009 suicide air raid on Colombo|a suicide mission]] carried out a [[kamikaze]] style air attack on the Sri Lankan capital [[Colombo]], killing 2 and wounding 45, but both planes were shot down by the [[Sri Lankan Air Force]] before they could damage the intended targets which were the Army Headquarters and the main Air Force base.&lt;ref name="australian-nottamed"&gt;{{cite news | work = The Australian | title = Kamikaze raid shows the Tamil Tigers have not been tamed | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25091354-25837,00.html | date = 22 September 2009 | accessdate = 23 February 2009 | first = Amanda | last = Hodge | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090508100212/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25091354-25837,00.html | archive-date = 8 May 2009 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tamil Tiger planes raid Colombo|date=20 February 2009|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7902392.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate =20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late March, the Tamil Tigers controlled only one square kilometre outside the no-fire zone, down from about 15,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; a mere three years ago. Political pressure was placed on President Rajapaksa to find a political solution to the conflict and he called for a meeting with [[Tamil National Alliance]], but they refused until the government resolved the humanitarian crisis faced by civilians trapped in the fighting.

The [[Battle of Aanandapuram]], which was described by military analyst/journalist [[D. B. S. Jeyaraj]] as the "defining moment" of the 3 decade war, was fought on 5 April. This battle saw the demise of most of the battle-hardened ground commanders of the LTTE, including Velayuthapillai Baheerathakumar ''alias'' Theepan, the overall commander of the LTTE northern front fighting formations. SLA soldiers numbering more than 50,000 from 5 divisions participated in the battle encircling the LTTE cadres inside a small littoral strip of territory located between the [[A35 highway (Sri Lanka)|Paranthan-Mullaitivu A35 highway]], [[Nanthi Lagoon|Nanthikadal]] and [[Chalai Lagoon]]s on one side and the Indian Ocean on the other. Rebel casualties amounted to 625.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anatomy of the LTTE military debacle at Aanandapuram|date=10 April 2009|url=http://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/archives/315|work=[[D. B. S.

On 21 April, Sri Lankan troops launched an assault, targeting LTTE leader, [[Vellupillai Prabhakaran]].

As fighting continued, a group of independent United Nations experts called on the [[Human Rights Council]] to urgently set up an international inquiry to address the "critical" situation in Sri Lanka amid fighting between the Army and Tamil rebels. According to the [[UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] ([[OCHA]]), over 196,000 people fled the conflict zone, a shrinking pocket of land on the north-east coastline, where clashes continued between government troops and the LTTE, while at least 50,000 people were still trapped there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Urgent international scrutiny needed in Sri Lanka, say UN rights experts|date=8 May 2009|url = https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=30740&amp;Cr=Sri%20Lanka&amp;Cr1=|publisher=United Nations|accessdate =11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A UN spokesman in Colombo, Gordon Weiss, said more than 100 children died during the "large-scale killing of civilians" and described the situation in northern Sri Lanka as a "bloodbath".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UN mourns Sri Lanka 'bloodbath'|date=11 May 2009|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8043169.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate =11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] said he was appalled at the killing of hundreds of Sri Lankan civilians caught in the middle of hostilities between the army and separatist Tamil rebels over the weekend.

The Sri Lankan armed forces claimed that the leader of the LTTE, [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]], was killed in the morning of 18 May 2009 while he was trying to flee the conflict zone in an ambulance. The announcement on state television came shortly after the military said it had surrounded Prabhakaran in a tiny patch of jungle in the north-east. ''The Daily Telegraph'' wrote that, according to Sri Lankan TV, Prabhakaran was "...&amp;nbsp;killed in a rocket-propelled grenade attack as he tried to escape the war zone in an Ambulance with his closest aides. [[Colonel Soosai]], the leader of his "[[Sea Tigers]]" navy, and [[Pottu Amman (Tamil militant)|Pottu Amman]], his intelligence chief were also killed in the attack."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nelson |first=Dean |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/srilanka/5343129/Sri-Lanka-Tamil-Tiger-leader-Velupillai-Prabhakaran-and-his-lieutenants-eliminated.html |title=Sri Lanka: Tamil Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and his lieutenants 'eliminated' |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=18 May 2009 |accessdate=30 May 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost of war==
[[File:Shelter from tarp and sticks.jpg|thumb|Shelter built from tarp and sticks. Pictured are displaced persons from the civil war in Sri Lanka]]

===Casualties===
{{Main article|Casualties of the Sri Lankan Civil War}}
The Sri Lankan Civil War was very costly, killing more 100,000 civilians and over 50,000 fighters from both sides of the conflict. The "Tamil Centre for Human Rights" recorded that from 1983 to 2004, 47,556 Tamil civilians were murdered by both the Sri Lankan government and IPKF forces. Another organization called [[NESOHR]] published that from the beginning of the war to the 2002 ceasefire, 4000 to 5000 Tamil civilians were killed in large scale massacres, with a total civilian death of around 40,000. Civilian casualties that occurred on 2009 is of major controversy, as there were no organizations to record the events during the final months of the war. The Sri Lankan government revealed that 9,000 people were killed in the final months of the war, but it did not differentiate between LTTE cadres and civilians. The [[UN]], based on credible witness evidence from aid agencies and civilians evacuated from the ''Safe Zone'' by sea, estimated that 6,500 civilians were killed and another 14,000 injured between mid-January 2009, when the ''Safe Zone'' was first declared, and mid-April 2009. There are no official casualty figures after this period but estimates of the death toll for the final four months of the civil war (mid-January to mid-May) range from 15,000 to 20,000. A [[US State Department]] report has suggested that the actual casualty figures were probably much higher than the UN's estimates and that significant numbers of casualties weren't recorded. A former UN official has claimed that up to 40,000 civilians may have been killed in the final stages of the civil war. Most of the details pertaining to the civilian casualties were reported by four doctors who worked in the no-fire zone. In a joint press conference after the war in July 2009 while still in [[Criminal Investigation Department (Sri Lanka)|CID]] custody, they recanted their initial reports, stating that the casualty figures were exaggerated and were handed to them by the LTTE.&lt;ref name="bbc080709"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8141007.stm|title=S Lanka medics recant on deaths|author=Charles Haviland|date=8 July 2009|accessdate=12 July 2009|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[United States diplomatic cables leak|leaked US diplomatic cable]] contains dispatches stating that the doctors upon their release in August 2009 are to have stated to US embassy personnel that they were heavily coached for the press conference and that they had not lied when giving their original statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09COLOMBO830|title=Doctors From No-fire Zone Released on Bail|accessdate=26 February 2012|publisher=Wikileaks|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618200233/http://cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09COLOMBO830|archive-date=18 June 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[US State Department]] report has suggested that the actual casualty figures were probably much higher than the UN estimates and that significant numbers of casualties were not recorded.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/131025.pdf|title=Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka|date=22 October 2009|publisher=[[Department of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon Weiss, a former UN official has claimed that up to 40,000 civilians may have been killed in the final stages of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/up-to-40000-civilians-died-in-sri-lanka-offensive-1897865.html|title=Up to 40,000 civilians 'died in Sri Lanka offensive'|last=Buncombe|first=Andrew|date=12 February 2010|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=23 May 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.N Secretary General's experts panel report had said that as many as 40,000 [[Tamil people|Tamil]] civilians could have been killed in the final phases of the [[Sri Lankan civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/SriLanka/40-000-Tamil-civilians-killed-in-final-phase-of-Lanka-war-says-UN-report/Article1-689575.aspx 40,000 Tamil civilians killed in final phase of Lanka war, says UN report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114031420/http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/SriLanka/40-000-Tamil-civilians-killed-in-final-phase-of-Lanka-war-says-UN-report/Article1-689575.aspx|date=14 November 2012}}.

However the report did not differentiate civilians from the slain LTTE cadres.

Several human rights groups have even claimed that the death toll in the last months of the war could be 70,000. The Sri Lankan government has denied all claims of causing mass casualties against Tamils, arguing that it was "taking care not to harm civilians". Instead, it has blamed the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|LTTE]] for the high casualty numbers, stating that they used the civilians as [[Human shields (law)|human shields.]] Both the [[Government of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan government]] and the [[LTTE]] have been accused by the U.N for war crimes during the last phase of the war. 

While the majority of civilian deaths were that of the Tamil minority, Both [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] and [[Sri Lankan Moors|Moor]] civilians died in the war. The [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|LTTE]] were estimated to be responsible for 3,700 to 4,100 civilian deaths in over 200 separate attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=jLdKBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=modest&amp;f=false|title=The Causes and Consequences of Group Violence:|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these civilian deaths, LTTE leader Prabhakaran denied allegations of killing civilians, claiming to condemn such acts of violence; and claimed that LTTE had instead attacked armed [[Home Guard|home guards]] who were "death-squads let loose on Tamil civilians" and Sinhalese settlers who were "brought to the Tamil areas to forcibly occupy the land.

Around 27,000+ LTTE cadres, 23,790+ Sri Lankan Army personnel, 1000+ Sri Lankan police, 1500 Indian soldiers were said to have died in the conflict. In 2008, the LTTE revealed that 22,390 fighters have lost their lives in the armed struggle since 27 November 1982, although it stopped keeping record in 2009.  Minister of Defence [[Gotabhaya Rajapaksa]] said on an interview with state television that 23,790 Sri Lankan military personnel were killed since 1981 (it was not specified if police or other non armed forces personnel were included in this particular figure). The [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]], a university-based data collection program considered to be "one of the most accurate and well-used data-sources on global armed conflicts" provides free data to the public and has divided Sri Lanka's conflicts into groups based on the actors involved. It collectively reported that between 1990 and 2009 between 59,193-75,601 people were killed in Sri Lanka during various three types of organized armed conflict: "State-based" conflicts, those that involved the Government of Sri Lanka against rebel groups(LTTE and the JVP), "Non-state" conflicts, those conflicts that did not involve the government of Sri Lanka (e.g. LTTE vs. LTTE-Karuna Faction, and LTTE vs. PLOTE), as well as "One-sided" violence, that involved deliberate attacks against civilians perpetrated by either LTTE or the Government of Sri Lanka.

===Economic cost===
The total economic cost of the 26-year war is estimated at US$200 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Economic Impacts of Sri Lanka's Civil War|url=http://www.asiaecon.org/special_articles/read_sp/12556|accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is approximately 5 times the GDP of Sri Lanka in 2009. Sri Lanka had spent US$5.5 billion only on Eelam War IV, which saw the end of LTTE. The government had spent US$2.25 billion to develop the [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern Province]] under the "Uthuru Wasanthaya" program after the end of war.&lt;ref name="obsy" /&gt; Measuring the opportunity cost of war, a report by [[Strategic Foresight Group]] states that Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) remained stagnant during periods of civil war and that net FDI increased during periods of ceasefire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategicforesight.com/publications.php?page=8#.UghwRdL7Br8 Cost of Conflict in Sri Lanka, 2006], Strategic Foresight Group&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

===A political solution===
After the complete military defeat of the LTTE, President Mahinda Rajapaksa announced that the government is committed to a political solution, and for this purpose action would be taken based on the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20090523_07 |title=IDPs: Govt. already acting on agreed areas of priority – President to Ban Ki-moon |publisher=Defence.lk |date=23 May 2009 |accessdate=30 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527085039/http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20090523_07 |archivedate=27 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-LTTE political party [[Tamil National Alliance]] (TNA), also the largest political group representing Sri Lankan Tamil community, dropped its demand for a [[Tamil Eelam|separate state]], in favour of a [[Federalism|federal]] solution.&lt;ref name="bbc1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardn" /&gt; There are ongoing bilateral talks between President Rajapaksa's [[United People's Freedom Alliance|UPFA]] government and the TNA, on a viable political solution and devolution of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=13002|title=Next round of Govt.-TNA talks on May 12|publisher=AdaDerana|date=30 April 2011 |accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in an interview to [[Headlines Today]], television channel from India, [[Gotabaya Rajapaksa]], Defence Secretary of Sri Lanka and brother of President [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]] binned "the political solution talk", asserting, among other things, that it was "simply irrelevant" because "we have ended this terrorism" in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/video/sri-lanka-in-denial-over-war-crimes/1/147696.html|title=Sri Lanka in denial over war crimes : Neighbours News – India Today|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/article2359597.ece | location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu  | title=A brother out of control | date=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission===
{{Main article|Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission}}
Following the end of the war in May 2009, amid mounting international pressure for an inquiry into the final stages of the war, President Rajapaksa appointed the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) to look back at the Sri Lankan Civil War, and to provide recommendations for an era of healing and peace building. The commission concluded that the [[Sri Lanka Armed Forces|Sri Lankan military]] didn't deliberately target civilians in the No Fire Zones.&lt;ref name="CBS161211"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lankan commission: Civilians weren't targeted |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501712_162-57344039/sri-lanka-war-commission-rules-out-willful-attacks/ |newspaper=[[Associated Press]]/[[CBS News]] |date=16 December 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission acknowledged that hospitals had been shelled, resulting in "considerable civilian casualties", but it did not say who was responsible for the shelling. The commission blamed Sinhalese and Tamil politicians for causing the civil war: the Sinhalese politicians failed to offer a solution acceptable to the Tamil people and the Tamil politicians fanned [[Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups|militant separatism]]. However the commission has been heavily criticised by human rights groups and UN Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability due its limited mandate, alleged lack of independence and its failure to meet minimum international standards or offer protection to witnesses.&lt;ref name="C4161211"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lankan civilians 'not targeted', says report|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/sri-lankan-civilians-werent-targeted-says-report|newspaper=Channel 4 News|date=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanitarian Impact===

Towards the end of the war, as Sri Lankan government forces advanced deeper into Tamil Tiger controlled areas, international concern grew for the fate of the 350,000 civilians trapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/17/srilanka-tamil-tigers-trapped-civilians|work=The Guardian |location=London|title=Fears grow for trapped civilians as army advances on Tamil Tigers|first=Amelia|last=Gentleman|date=18 January 2009|accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 January 2009, the Sri Lankan military declared a 32 square kilometres (12.4&amp;nbsp;mi) ''Safe Zone'' located northwest of Puthukkudiviruppu, between the A35 Highway and the Chalai Lagoon. [[Sri Lankan Air Force]] aircraft dropped leaflets urging civilians to relocate to the safe zone and wait until the army could move them into safer locations. The Sri Lankan military promised not to fire into the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/22/sri-lanka-military|work=The Guardian |location=London|title=Military declares civilian safety zone in rebel area|date=22 January 2009|accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only small numbers of civilians actually crossed into the Safe Zone, and the Sri Lankan government, the United Nations, and human rights organisations accused the LTTE of preventing civilians from leaving. The fighting eventually caused civilians to flee the safe zone to a narrow strip of land between [[Nanthi Kadal]] and the Indian Ocean. The Sri Lankan military declared a new {{convert|10|km2|sqmi|adj=on}} Safe Zone northwest of [[Mullaitivu]] on 12 February. Over the next three months, the Sri Lankan military repeatedly attacked the Safe Zone with aircraft and artillery to destroy the last remnants of the Tamil Tigers trapped there. The Sri Lankan government claimed that it was trying to hit Tamil Tiger positions, and claimed that these raids started on 15 February and ended on 19 April, the day before the Army breached Tamil Tiger defences, and civilians started to pour out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2009/05/20095141557222873.html Sri Lanka admits bombing safe zone – Central &amp; South Asia].

The final stages of the war created 300,000 [[internally displaced persons]] (IDPs) who were transferred to camps in [[Vavuniya District]] and detained there against their will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa37/016/2009/en/ |title=ASA 37/016/2009 Unlock the Camps in Sri Lanka: Safety and Dignity for the Displaced Now |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |date=10 August 2009 |accessdate=22 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The camps were surrounded by barbed wire.

Since 1983, the civil war caused mass outflow of Tamil civilians from Sri Lanka to South India. After the end of the war, nearly 5,000 of them returned to the country. As of July 2012, 68,152 Sri Lankans were living in South India as refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/south/over-750-lankan-refugees-returned-to-the-island-this-year-246982 | title=Over 750 Lankan refugees returned to the Island this year | publisher=NDTV | date=24 July 2012 | agency=Press Trust of India | accessdate=26 July 2012 | location=Chennai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detainees===
The continuous defeats of the LTTE had made its cadres abandon the outfit in large numbers. With the end of the hostilities, 11,664 LTTE members, including over 500 child soldiers surrendered to the Sri Lankan military. Among them were 1,601 females. Government took action to rehabilitate these cadres under a "National Action Plan for the Re-integration of Ex-combatants". They were divided into 3 categories; hardcore, non-combatants, and those who were forcefully recruited (including child soldiers). 24 rehabilitation centres were set up in Jaffna, Batticaloa and Vavuniya. Among the apprehended cadres, there had been about 700 hardcore members. Some of these cadres were integrated into State Intelligence Services to tackle the internal and external networks of LTTE.&lt;ref name="obshgd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sangam.org/2011/03/Surrendered_Cadres.php?uid=4299&amp;print=true|title=Sri Lanka 'Taming The Tigers'|publisher=Sangam.org|date=March 2011|accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2012, government had released more than 11,000 cadres, and only 4 rehabilitation centres and 550 detainees remained.&lt;ref name="detn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/sl-frees-73-rehabilitated-exltte-members/223232-2.html|title=Sri Lanka frees 73 rehabilitated ex-LTTE members|publisher=IBN Live|date=22 January 2012|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land mines===
The end of the war left past conflict zones of 2,061sq.km heavily contaminated with approximately 1.6 million land mines.  By January 2012, deminers employed by the Sri Lankan army and 8 foreign funded agencies had cleared 1,934sq.km leaving about 127sq.km yet to be cleared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iewy.com/40150-over-1930-sq-kms-landmines-free-in-north.html|publisher=iewy.com|title=Over 1,930 sq. km landmines free in North|date=January 2012|accessdate=22 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123112837/http://www.iewy.com/40150-over-1930-sq-kms-landmines-free-in-north.html|archivedate=23 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the end of the war, more than 5,000 Tamil youths have been gathering at selected police stations in Eastern Province to join the police force as the government has called for interviews. The Sri Lankan government had planned to recruit 2,000 new police officers to the department, especially for the services in the northern region of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colombopage.com/archive_091/May1242917634RA.html Sri Lanka : More Tamil youths want to join Sri Lanka Police].

The collective objective of the protests was to persuade world national leaders to stop the civil war and bring a permanent ceasefire with an internationally coordinated diplomatic strategy.

===War crimes investigations===
In March 2014, the [[United Nations Human Rights Commission]] drafted a resolution on "Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka" and requested its High Commissioner Ms. [[Navi Pillay]]  to undertake a comprehensive investigation into alleged serious violations and human rights abuses that have taken place during the war. Subsequently, the Human Rights Commissioner directed the setting up of OHCHR Investigation in Sri Lanka (OISL).&lt;ref name="ohchr"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/OISL.aspx | title=OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka | publisher=UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL | accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sri Lankan state which is accused of perpetuating [[war crime]]s, has reportedly refused to cooperate with the inquiry.&lt;ref name="slg1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2014/09/lanka-will-not-cooperating-with-ohchr.html | title=Lanka Will Not Cooperating With The OHCHR Investigation | publisher=Sri Lanka Guardian | accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, the state rejected entry visas for investigating U.N. officials.

It has condemned the UN report as "fundamentally flawed in many respects" and "based on patently biased material which is presented without any verification".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Government of Sri Lanka states that the report of the UN Secretary General’s Panel of Experts is fundamentally flawed in many respects|url=http://www.mea.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2730&amp;Itemid=75|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501105809/http://www.mea.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2730&amp;Itemid=75|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 May 2011|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Sri Lanka)|Ministry of External Affairs]]|date=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission]], a formal [[commission of inquiry]] was appointed by the Sri Lankan President, to review the conflict from 1983 to 2009 and its report was tabled in the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=President Releases LLRC Report To Parliament, The UN And Public|url=http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2011/12/18/president-releases-llrc-report-to-parliament-the-un-and-public/|newspaper=The Sunday Leader|date=18 December 2011|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 July 2012, Sri Lanka brought out a road map fixing time lines for investigating alleged war crimes by its army during the final stages of the war with the LTTE in 2009. The cabinet has approved the action plan for the implementation of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.indianexpress.com/news/sri-lanka-sets-roadmap-to-investigate-war-crimes/980195/|title= Sri Lanka sets roadmap to investigate war crimes| date= 27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said in September 2013 that there had been no comprehensive Sri Lankan effort to properly and independently investigate allegations of war crimes. The High Commissioner said she would recommend the Human Rights Council to set up its own probe if Sri Lanka does not show more "credible" progress by March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UN calls on Sri Lanka to probe war crimes|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/09/un-raises-sri-lanka-war-crimes-concerns-2013925223211209555.html|newspaper=Al Jazeera|date=25 September 2013|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 March 2014 the United Nations Human Rights Council voted for a resolution paving the way for an inquiry into rights abuses at the end of Sri Lanka's civil war. The United States and the United Kingdom were among the countries which sponsored the resolution, which for the first time called for an international probe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UN council votes for Sri Lanka civil war rights abuses inquiry |url=http://aninews.in/newsdetail4/story161403/un-council-votes-for-sri-lanka-civil-war-rights-abuses-inquiry.html|newspaper=ANI News|date=28 March 2014|accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new government of [[Maithripala Sirisena|President Maithripala Sirisena]] has requested the international community for support on a domestic probe into war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deen|first=Thalif |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2015/02/sri-lanka-seeks-u-s-u-n-backing-for-domestic-probe-of-war-crimes-charges/|title=Sri Lanka Seeks U.S.-U.N. Backing for Domestic Probe of War Crimes Charges|date=6 February 2015|publisher=Inter Press Service News Agency|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2015, the [[UN]] have expressed their support for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adaderana.lk/news/30003/un-supports-a-credible-domestic-probe-in-sri-lanka-|title=UN supports a credible domestic probe in Sri Lanka|publisher= Ada Derana|date=3 March 2015|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Tamil National alliance has asked for an international investigation into the alleged human rights abuses during the Sri Lankan civil war and has refused a domestic probe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tamils firm on international probe says TNA {{!}} Colombo Gazette|url = http://colombogazette.com/2015/08/29/tamils-firm-on-international-probe-says-tna/|accessdate = 2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sri Lanka: TNA Rejects Domestic Probe {{!}} Sri Lanka Brief|url = http://srilankabrief.org/2015/01/sri-lanka-tna-rejects-domestic-probe/|website = srilankabrief.org|accessdate = 2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of the TNA led by Wigneshwaran has asked for an investigation into the alleged genocide claims but the TNA as a whole was divided on the issue and MP Senathirajah said that the action was unauthorized by the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = TNA divided over Wigneswaran’s call for genocide probe {{!}} SRI TV News|url = http://sritvnews.lk/2015/02/13/tna-divided-over-wigneswarans-call-for-genocide-probe/|accessdate = 2015-09-20|first = Sugath|last = Dharmapriya|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150330021925/http://sritvnews.lk/2015/02/13/tna-divided-over-wigneswarans-call-for-genocide-probe/|archivedate = 30 March 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tamil National Alliance has welcomed a domestic investigation with a hybrid court and [[R.

== Transitional Justice and steps for non-recurrence ==
In 2015 the Sri Lankan government decided to create a truth commission based on the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] of South Africa to probe allegations during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lanka to set up a South Africa-style truth and reconciliation commission|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/15/sri-lanka-to-set-up-a-south-africa-style-truth-and-reconciliation-commission|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Foreign Minister [[Mangala Samaraweera]] a new constitution is expected solve issues related to the war and ensure non-recurrence.

==Allegations of Genocide==
The first international voice to support the genocide against the Government of Sri Lanka under international law is raised by [[Human Rights Watch]] and it has advocated and published the details in December 2009. Leading American expert in international law, Professor Francis A. Boyle hold an emergency meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon to urge to stop Tamil genocide by providing the evidence of crimes against humanity, genocide against Tamils and the international community's failure to stop the slaughter of Tamil civilians in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Failure to Protect Tamil Rights Under International Law|url=http://www.claritypress.com/Boyle-Tamil.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Francis Anthony Boyle|first1=Professor|title=The Tamil Genocide by Sri Lanka: The Global Failure to Protect Tamil Rights Under International Law|isbn=978-0932863706|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9082654-the-tamil-genocide-by-sri-lanka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, the [[Permanent Peoples' Tribunal|Permanent People's Tribunal]] on Sri Lankan held its sessions in Dublin, Ireland. There were four findings:
# That the Sri Lankan Government and its military are guilty of War Crimes;
# That the Sri Lankan Government and its military are guilty of crimes against humanity;
# That the charge of genocide requires further investigation;
# That the international community, particularly the UK and USA, share responsibility for the breakdown of the peace process.(2)
It also found that member states of the United Nations had not "complied with their moral obligation to seek justice for the violations of human rights committed during the last period of the war".&lt;ref name="Dublin-Tribunal-init"&gt;{{cite news|title=Permanent People's Tribunal {{!}} Tribunal on Sri Lanka|agency=Permanent People's Tribunal|issue=16 January 2010|publisher=The Irish School of Ecumenics, Trinity College Dublin The School of Law and Government, Dublin City University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 22 September 2010, the [[UNROW Human Rights Impact Litigation Clinic]], has advocated and litigated on behalf of victims of the armed conflict in [[Sri Lanka]]. [[UNROW|UNROW Human Rights Impact Litigation Clinic]] released a report calling for the establishment of a new international tribunal to prosecute those most responsible for the crimes committed during the conflict. [[UNROW|UNROW Human Rights Impact Litigation Clinic]] also submitted evidence of human rights violations committed during the armed conflict to the United Nations Panel of Experts on Sri Lanka, which U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon appointed in 2010.&lt;ref name="LegalCaseOfTheTamil"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Legal Case of the Tamil Genocide|url=http://hrbrief.org/2015/01/the-legal-case-of-the-tamil-genocide/|website=hrbrief.org|publisher=Human Rights Brief|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November,03 2012, panel of 11 member International Experts, consisting of experts in genocide studies, former UN officials, experts in international law and renowned peace and human rights activists to be convened as Judges appointed by [[Permanent Peoples' Tribunal|Permanent People's Tribunal]] to investigate and examine reports submitted by many specialised working groups on the accusation of the crime of Genocide against the Government of Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="Dublin-Tribunal-init" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dublin tribunal takes up genocide investigation|url=https://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=35722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 27 March 2013, Tamil Nadu State Assembly has passed resolution to called on the Indian Government to stop considering Sri Lanka as a 'friendly country' and impose economic sanctions, as well as calling for an international inquiry in "genocide and war crimes" against Sri Lankan Tamils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TN Assembly demands referendum for separate Tamil Eelam|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/tn-assembly-demands-referendum-for-separate-tamil-eelam_838176.html|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 10 December 2013, [[Permanent Peoples' Tribunal|Permanent People's Tribunal]] unanimously ruled Sri Lanka guilty of the crime of genocide against the Tamil people, while the US and UK were found to be guilty of complicity to this crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lanka guilty of genocide against Eelam Tamils with UK, US complicity: PPT|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/tribunal-delivers-sri-lankas-guilty-verdict-20140101-305zf.html|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tribunal condemns Sri Lankan genocide against Eelam Tamils|url=https://redflag.org.au/article/tribunal-condemns-sri-lankan-genocide-against-eelam-tamils|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lanka guilty of genocide against Eelam Tamils with UK, US complicity: PPT|url=http://www.jdslanka.org/index.php/news-features/human-rights/426-sri-lanka-guilty-of-genocide-against-tamils-with-uk-us-complicity-ppt-rules|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Peoples’ Tribunal on Sri Lanka 07-10 December 2013|journal=Peoples’ Tribunal on Sri Lanka – Permanent People’s Tribunal|date=10 December 2013|volume=Permanent People’s Tribunal|url=http://www.ptsrilanka.org/images/documents/ppt_final_report_web_en.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160607003937/http://www.ptsrilanka.org/images/documents/ppt_final_report_web_en.pdf|archivedate=7 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January, 2015, [[UNROW|UNROW Human Rights Impact Litigation Clinic]] filed a paper on "The Legal Case of the Tamil Genocide" based on the evidence, nature and extent of the violence committed by Government Forces against Tamils.&lt;ref name="LegalCaseOfTheTamil" /&gt;

In 12 April 2015, the [[Northern Provincial Council]] of Sri Lanka [[2015 Northern Province Council resolution on genocide of Tamils|passed a resolution]] calling the UN to investigate the genocide and direct appropriate measures at the International Court of Justice stating that the Tamils had no faith in the domestic commission.&lt;ref name="tgnpc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tamilguardian.com/article.asp?articleid=13726 | title=NPC passes resolution asking UN to investigate genocide of Tamils by Sri Lanka state | publisher=Tamil Guardian | accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nienpc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/Lanka%E2%80%99s-Northern-Council-Passes-Damning-Resolution-on-Genocide/2015/02/10/article2662323.ece | title=Lanka’s Northern Council Passes Damning Resolution on Genocide | publisher=The New Indian Express | accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wswsnpc"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/03/07/npsl-m07.html | title=Tamil party in Sri Lanka calls for international war crimes inquiry | publisher=World Socialist Web Site | accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017 current president [[Maithripala Sirisena]] refused to let several human rights groups take [[Jagath Jayasuriya]] to court for war crimes. He reportedly said "I stated very clearly that I will not allow anyone in the world to touch Jagath Jayasuriya or any other military chief or any war hero in this country," in reference to the lawsuit. His comments are seen as an attempt to pander to the majority ethnic Sinhalese, most of whom oppose legal action against military personnel accused of crimes during the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/sri-lanka-leader-shield-general-war-crimes-case-170903193335527.html|title=Sri Lanka leader to shield general from war crimes case|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sylvestr''' (''Сильвестр'' in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]) ([[Circa|c.]]1055&amp;ndash;1123) was a [[clergyman]] and a writer in Kievan Rus.

Some sources name Sylvestr as a compiler of either the [[Primary Chronicle]] itself or its second edition. He was a [[hegumen]] of the [[Vydubetsky Monastery]] in [[Kiev]], which had been founded by [[Prince]] [[Vsevolod Yaroslavich]]. In 1118, Sylvestr was sent to [[Pereyaslav-Khmelnytskyy|Pereyaslavl Yuzhniy]] as a [[bishop]].

As a person close to Vsevolod's son [[Vladimir Monomakh]], Sylvestr played a notable role in political and [[ecclesiastic]]al affairs of [[Kievan Rus]].

He is said to have continued the work of St [[Nestor the Chronicler]] and written nine Lives of the holy saints of the Kiev Caves. He is celebrated on September 28 and commemorated on January 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?FSID=100009 Orthodox Church of America: Feasts and Saints]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fr. Thomas "Tom" J. Morrissey''', historian, teacher and writer, was the fifth Director of Education at the College of Industrial Relations ([[National College of Ireland]]) from 1983 to 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncirl.ie/About/History-of-NCI/Chronogology-of-the-College, Chronology of the College],  [[National College of Ireland]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fr. Thomas was born in Limerick and was educated at [[Crescent College]]. He entered the Jesuit Order in 1948. He studied history at University College Dublin and graduated with a master's degree.  In 1976 he was awarded a doctorate in education at University College Cork. He taught at Sacred Heart College, Limerick and at Mungret College from 1963 to 1968.

He played a major role in the planning and development of [[Crescent College Comprehensive S.J.]] in Limerick and was its headmaster from 1969 until 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crescentpast.com/fr-todd-morrissey/ crescentpast.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crescentsj.com/ethos/history-of-crescent-college-comprehensivesj/ History of Crescent College ComprehensiveSJ], [[Crescent College Comprehensive S.J.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was Director of the College of Industrial Relations ([[National College of Ireland]]) from 1983 to 1990. During this time he developed a Board of Management to govern the College and registered it under the Companies Act (1963).

Fr Morrissey has published over twelve books.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n79136741/ WorldCat Identities]&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in 1980 ''James Archer of Kilkenny'', the biography of a colourful and controversial sixteenth-century Jesuit. In 2010 he published a biography of [[Edward Joseph Byrne|Edward Byrne]], former archbishop of Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Yonaguni Monument'''|与那国島海底地形|Yonaguni-jima Kaitei Chikei|lit. "Yonaguni Island Submarine Topography"|lead=yes}}, also known as {{nihongo4|"Yonaguni (Island) Submarine Ruins"|与那国（島）海底遺跡|Yonaguni(-jima) Kaitei Iseki}}, is a submerged rock formation off the coast of [[Yonaguni]], the southernmost of the [[Ryukyu Islands]], in [[Japan]]. It lies approximately a hundred kilometres east of Taiwan.

Marine geologist [[Masaaki Kimura]] claims that the formations are man-made stepped [[monolith]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Deep Secrets". New Scientist. Vol. 204, Issue 2736. 28 November 2009. P. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas are disputed and there is debate about whether the site is completely natural, a natural site that has been modified, or a man-made artefact.&lt;ref name=schoch&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.robertschoch.net/Enigmatic%20Yonaguni%20Underwater%20RMS%20CT.htm |title= Yonaguni Enigmatic Underwater Monuments | first = Robert M. | last = Schoch |authorlink= Robert M.

==Discovery==
The sea off Yonaguni is a popular diving location during the winter months because of its large population of [[hammerhead shark]]s. In 1986, while looking for a good place to observe the sharks, Kihachiro Aratake, a director of the Yonaguni-Cho Tourism Association, noticed some singular seabed formations resembling [[architectural]] structures.&lt;ref name="west"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.robertschoch.net/Diving%20For%20Lemuria%20John%20West%20Colette%20Dowell%20CT.htm | first = John Anthony | last = West |title= Diving for Lemuria |year=1998 |accessdate=2010-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, a group of scientists directed by [[Masaaki Kimura]] of the [[University of the Ryūkyūs]] visited the formations.

The formation has since become a relatively popular attraction for divers despite strong [[sea current|current]]s.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt; In 1997, Japanese industrialist Yasuo Watanabe sponsored an informal expedition including [[pseudoarchaeology]] writers [[John Anthony West]] and [[Graham Hancock]], geologist and fringe theorist [[Robert Schoch]], photographer Santha Faiia, a few sport divers and instructors and a film crew for [[Channel 4]] and [[Discovery Channel]]. Another notable visitor was [[freediving|freediver]] [[Jacques Mayol]], who wrote a book on his dives at Yonaguni.&lt;ref name="mayol"&gt;{{cite book|title= Heritage des Peuples de la Mer |authorlink = Jacques Mayol | first = Jacques | last = Mayol }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main features==
The monument consists of medium to very fine [[sandstone]]s and [[mudstone]]s of the [[Lower Miocene]] [[Yaeyama Group]] believed to have been deposited about 20&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name=schoch /&gt; Most of the formations are connected to the underlying rock mass (as opposed to being assembled out of freestanding rocks).

[[File:Turtleyonaguni.jpg|thumb|The formation called "The Turtle"|right]]

The main feature (the "monument" proper) is a rectangular formation measuring about {{convert|150|by|40|m|abbr=on}} and about {{convert|27|m|-1|abbr=on}} tall; the top is about {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}} below sea level.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[Ancient Discoveries]]: Lost Cities of the Deep'' History Channel&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of its details are said to be:
* Two closely spaced pillars which rise to within 2.4 m of the surface
* A {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}} wide ledge that encircles the base of the formation on three sides
* A stone column about {{convert|7|m|abbr=on}} tall
* A straight wall {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} long
* An isolated boulder resting on a low platform
* A low star-shaped platform
* A triangular depression with two large holes at its edge
* An L-shaped rock&lt;ref name="schoch" /&gt;

==Interpretations==

===Natural formation===
Some of those who have studied the formation, such as geologist [[Robert Schoch]] of Boston University, state that it is most likely a natural formation, possibly used and modified by humans in the past.&lt;ref name="schoch" /&gt; Schoch observed the sandstones that make up the Yonaguni formation to "contain numerous well-defined, parallel bedding planes along which the layers easily separate. The rocks of this group are also criss-crossed by numerous sets of parallel, vertically oriented joints in the rock. These joints are natural, parallel fractures by which the rectangular formations seen in the monument likely formed. Yonaguni lies in an earthquake-prone region; such earthquakes tend to fracture the rocks in a regular manner."&lt;ref name=schoch /&gt;&lt;ref name="ngmyst" /&gt; He also observes that on the northeast coast of Yonaguni there are regular formations similar to those seen at the monument.&lt;ref name=schoch /&gt;&lt;ref name="natgeo"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/09/photogalleries/japan-pictures/ |title= National Geographic News Photo Gallery: Asian "Atlantis" Shows Strange Structure |accessdate=2010-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schoch also believes that the "drawings" identified by Kimura are natural scratches on the rocks.&lt;ref name="ngmyst" /&gt; This is also the view of [[John Anthony West]],&lt;ref name="west" /&gt; who suggests that the "walls" are simply natural horizontal platforms which fell into a vertical position when rock below them eroded, and the alleged roads are simply channels in the rock.&lt;ref name="Yonaguni, Japan"/&gt;

[[Patrick D. Nunn]], Professor of Oceanic Geoscience at the [[University of the South Pacific]], has studied these formations extensively and notes that the formations below the water continue in the Sanninudai slate cliffs above, which have "been fashioned solely by natural processes", and concludes in regard to the underwater formations: "There seems no reason to suppose that they are artificial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vanished Islands and Hidden Continents of the Pacific |last=Nunn |first=Patrick D. |year=2009 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |location=Honolulu |isbn=978-0-8248-3219-3 |page=127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of an ancient stone-working tradition at Yonaguni and other Ryukyu islands is demonstrated by some old tombs and several [[Yonaguni stone vessels|stone vessels]] of uncertain age.&lt;ref name="schoch" /&gt; Small camps, pottery, stone tools, and large fireplaces were found on Yonaguni, possibly dating back to 2500 BCE. Archaeologist [[Richard J. Pearson]] notes, however, that these were small communities: "They are not likely to have had extra energy for building stone monuments."&lt;ref name="Yonaguni, Japan" /&gt;

===Artificial structures===
The flat parallel faces, sharp edges, and mostly right angles of the formation have led some to conclude that the features are man-made.&lt;ref name="JMP"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Japan's Mysterious Pyramids | episodelink = | url = | series = World History | serieslink = | credits = | network = History Channel | station = | city = | airdate = 2000-12-11 | began = | ended = | season = | seriesno = | number = SKU ID #70565 | minutes = 50 minutes | transcript = | transcripturl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These features include a trench that has two internal 90° angles as well as the twin [[megalith]]s that, according to Kimura, appear to have been placed there.&lt;ref name="mukimura" /&gt; These megaliths have straight edges and square corners; however, sea currents have been known to move large rocks on a regular basis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HM1"&gt;''[[History's Mysteries]]: Japan's mysterious pyramids'' History channel , ep. #7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quark"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Umi ni shizunda chō-kodai bunmei (The Submerged Ancient Civilizations) |journal= Quark |publisher= Kōdansha |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those who see the formations as being largely natural claim that they may have been modified by human hands.&lt;ref name=schoch /&gt;

Other evidence presented by those who favour an artificial origin include the two round holes (about 2 feet wide, according to photographs) on the edge of the Triangle Pool feature and a straight row of smaller holes that have been interpreted as an abandoned attempt to split off a section of the rock by means of wedges, found in ancient [[quarry|quarries]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} Kimura believes he has identified traces of animal drawings and people engraved into the rocks, including a horselike sign he believes resembles a character from the [[Kaidā glyphs|Kaida script]].&lt;ref name="mukimura" /&gt; Some have also interpreted a formation on the side of one of the monuments as a crude [[moai]]-like "face".{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Supporters of artificial origin, such as the [[pseudoarchaeology]] writer [[Graham Hancock]], also argue that while many of the features seen at Yonaguni are also seen in natural sandstone formations throughout the world, the concentration of so many peculiar formations in such a small area is highly unlikely.&lt;ref name="JMP" /&gt; They also point to the relative absence of loose blocks on the flat areas of the formation, which would be expected if they were formed solely by natural erosion and fracturing. Robert Schoch has noted that the rocks are swept with strong currents.&lt;ref name="Yonaguni, Japan"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Yonaguni, Japan |journal= [[New Scientist]] |issue=2736 |date= 2009-11-25 |url= https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427361.500-yonaguni-japan.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091128015636/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427361.500-yonaguni-japan.html |archivedate= 2009-11-28 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kimura first estimated that the monument must be at least 10,000 years old (8,000 BCE), dating it to a period when it would have been above water.&lt;ref name="HM1"/&gt; In a report given to the 21st Pacific Science Congress in 2007, he revised this estimate and dated it to 2,000 to 3,000 years ago because the sea level then was close to current levels. He suggests that after construction, tectonic activity caused it to be submerged below sea level.&lt;ref name="mukimura" /&gt; Archaeologist [[Richard J. Pearson]] believes this to be unlikely.&lt;ref name="Yonaguni, Japan"/&gt; Kimura believes he can identify a pyramid, castles, roads, monuments and a stadium. Kimura has also surmised that the site may be a remnant of the mythical [[Mu (lost continent)|lost continent of Mu]].&lt;ref name="mukimura"/&gt;
