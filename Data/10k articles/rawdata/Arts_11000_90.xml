==History==
The theater is a monument listed by the Institute of Historical and Artistic Heritage of Rio Grande do Norte. It was designed by the engineer José de Berredo; construction started in 1898, under the direction of Major Theodósio Paiva. It was inaugurated in the year 1904, and originally was named the [[Antônio Carlos Gomes|Carlos Gomes]] Theatre.

In the second government of Alberto Maranhão, the theater closed for renovations. It reopened as the "Gran-Campañia Española de Zarzuela, Opera y Opereta Pablo López", 19 July 1912, with the operetta "Princesa dos dólares" ("Princess of dollars") by Leo Fall.

In 1957, Mayor Djalma Maranhão changed its name to Teatro Alberto Maranhão. In 1959 it was further renovated, and reopened on 24 March 1960.

The José Augusto Foundation initiated a new renovation in June 1988, including dressing rooms, auditorium, garden, audience and stage, trying to restore it under the technical supervision of the Coordinator of the Historical and Artistic Patrimony of the State. On its centennial in 2004, another renovation began focused on accessibility, air conditioning, and general repairs.

'''Alexander Ivanovich Dmitriev-Mamonov''' (Russian: Александр Иванович Дмитриев-Мамонов; 24  December 1787 in [[Saint Petersburg]] &amp;ndash; 9 December 1836 in [[Moscow]]) was the commander of a Belarusian [[Hussar]] regiment and a [[battle painter]].

== Biography ==
He was born into a noble family and was the son of Major-General Ivan Dmitriev-Mamonov (1754-1812). His mother, Mariya (1768-1794), died when he was only seven and his father remarried into the Tolstoy family.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/%D0%98%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD-%D0%A4%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87-%D0%94%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2-%D0%9C%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2/6000000008806275819 Ivan Dmitriev-Mamonov] @ [[Geni.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; Most sources say that his father's second wife, Yelena (1772-1855), was his mother.

After 1806, he served as an [[actuary]] at the [[Collegium of Foreign Affairs]], then moved to the State Chancellery.&lt;ref name="N"&gt;[http://napoleonic.ru/история/персоналии/дмитриев-мамонов-александр-иванович Brief biography] @ Napoleonic.ru.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812, he joined the [[Narodnoe Opolcheniye|People's Militia]] in Moscow. He received the rank of Lieutenant and served in the battles of [[Battle of Ostrovno|Ostrovno]], [[Battle of Valutino|Valutino]], [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]] and [[Battle of Krasnoi|Krasnoi]]. In 1813, he was assigned to a Hussar regiment, commanded by General [[Pyotr Petrovich Palen|Pyotr Palen]], that followed Napoleon's retreating army and participated in numerous battles before reaching Paris.&lt;ref name="N" /&gt;
[[File:A.I.Dmitriev-Mamonov-Fere-Champenoise.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[Battle of Fère-Champenoise]]]]
In 1816, he became an [[adjutant]] to General [[Nikita Volkonsky]] and promotions followed rapidly. By 1823, he had been promoted to Colonel and left the General's service.&lt;ref name="N" /&gt; He had several friends among the [[Decembrist revolt|Decembrists]] and the courage to speak out on behalf of those who had been exiled or placed in custody. In 1827, he was given command of a Hussar regiment and, in 1830, took part in suppressing the [[November Uprising]]. The following year, he was promoted to Major-General.&lt;ref name="N" /&gt; Over the next few years, he commanded [[light cavalry]] and [[Uhlan]] regiments, as well as the Hussars.

In addition to his military activities, he was an amateur artist and brought back numerous  sketches from the battles he had seen during the Napoleonic campaigns. In 1820, he was one of the founders of the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]], together with {{ill|Ivan Alexeyevich Gagarin|ru|Гагарин, Иван Алексеевич}} and [[Pyotr Kikin]]. Seven years later, he established a drawing school. Many of his sketches and watercolors are displayed in the buildings at [[Tsarskoye Selo]]. 

In 1835, he moved into the civil service and became a [[State Counsellor (Russia)|State Councillor]] at the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The awards he received during his military career include the [[Order of Saint Vladimir]], [[Order of Saint Anna]], the [[Medal "For the Capture of Paris"]] and the order [[Pour le Mérite]].&lt;ref name="N" /&gt;

His wife, Sofia, was [[Maid of honour|maid of honor]] to [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg)|Maria Feodorovna]]. His son, [[Emmanuil Dmitriev-Mamonov|Emmanuil]], was a portrait painter, art historian and noted [[Slavophile]].

The reuse of [[Intellectual Property]] ([[Intellectual Property|IP]]) [[asset]]s (also known as Software Assets &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.forrester.com/The+Move+To+An+AssetBased+Services+Play/fulltext/-/E-RES71081#/Software+Asset+Inventory+H2+2012/fulltext/-/E-RES84061/|publisher=forrester.com|title= Software Asset Inventory, H2 2012|accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a strategy that many, in particular [[Information technology|IT]], companies are pursuing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Enterprise-Applications/Reusable-Asset-Initiative-is-IBMs-Secret-Weapon-for-Industry-Solutions-853170/|publisher=eWeek.com|title= Reusable Asset Initiative Is IBM's Secret Weapon for Industry Solutions|accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-assetreuse/|publisher=ibm.com|title= RWeb services and asset reuse|accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategy for reusing non-IT related assets is called [[Asset recovery]]. However, the term recovery is not being applied to [[Intellectual Property]] ([[Intellectual Property|IP]]) [[asset]]s.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.anthillpro.com/html/solutions/reuse.html|publisher=www.anthillpro.com|title= How Does AnthillPro Help Me Reuse My Software Assets?|accessdate=2010-04-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100310173944/http://www.anthillpro.com/html/solutions/reuse.html| archivedate= 10 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/ISPW.1996.654354|publisher=computer.org|title= An open architecture for software process asset reuse|accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These IP assets (or software assets) can be defined as (see Forrester &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.forrester.com/The+Move+To+An+AssetBased+Services+Play/fulltext/-/E-RES71081#/Software+Asset+Inventory+H2+2012/fulltext/-/E-RES84061/|publisher=forrester.com|title= Software Asset Inventory, H2 2012|accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;):
Internally developed or acquired software artifacts that IT services vendors use to automate a particular business process or aspect of product development for a range of clients. Software assets provide 30% to 90% of the solution that the client is looking for and are reused across multiple engagements.

==Benefits for the client==
Amongst other benefits, the key advantages of reusing assets are:
# Increase delivery efficiency
# Innovate from a higher level
# Use best practices
# Reduce risk
# Offer wider array of flexible solutions.

==Requirements==
In order to implement Asset Reuse within a major company, it takes at least:
* a system where to store and retrieve relevant assets
* a management system to handle the asset management
* a communication set-up to promote the reuse of piled up assets.

==Implications==
Till now a number of companies have tried to implement asset reuse. However, common implications are:
* the use of more than one asset repository
* the operation model: set-up, funding, and maintenance of the required asset management system including success tracking over a long time
* permanent cross-company communication of the asset management system strategy and its latest elements

'''Bianca''' is a fictional character in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1601–1604).  She is [[Michael Cassio|Cassio]]'s jealous lover. Despite her brief appearance on stage, Bianca plays a significant role in the progress of [[Iago]]'s scheme to incite [[Othello (character)|Othello]]'s jealousy of Cassio.  Bianca is traditionally regarded as a [[courtesan]], although this occupation is not specifically designated in the drama. The character was occasionally cut from performances in the 19th century on moral grounds.&lt;ref name="Four Tragedies" /&gt; Bianca is not to be confused with [[Bianca Minola]] in Shakespeare's ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]''.

== Sources ==
''Othello'' has its source in the 1565 tale "Un Capitano Moro" from ''Gli Hecatommithi'' by [[Cinthio|Giovanni Battista Giraldi Cinthio]].  While no English translation of Cinthio was available in Shakespeare's lifetime, it is probable that Shakespeare knew both the Italian original and Gabriel Chappuy's 1584 French translation.  Cinthio's tale may have been based on an actual incident occurring in [[Venice]] about 1508.&lt;ref name="Four Tragedies" /&gt;

Bianca is based upon a character in Cinthio's tale who, apparently of her own volition, copies the work in the [[handkerchief]] after finding it in the Cassio counterpart's house. While the woman sits with the handkerchief at a window, the ensign makes certain the Moor sees her with it. The Moor then believes he is confirmed in his suspicions of Desdemona's adultery. It is unclear if Cinthio's character is a courtesan, wife, or other.

== Role in ''Othello'' ==
[[File:William Holman Hunt - Bianca.jpg|thumb|left|Painting by [[William Holman Hunt]]]]

In 3.3, Iago reveals to the audience that, having surreptitiously obtained the handkerchief that Othello had originally given [[Desdemona]] as a lover's token, he will lose it in Cassio's lodging. Upon discovering the handkerchief in the following scene, Cassio admires its craftsmanship and asks Bianca to copy it for him. Bianca, already furious with Cassio for his apparent disregard of their relationship, suggests that the handkerchief is a gift from another woman, but eventually agrees to his request.

Midway through 4.1., and prior to Bianca's entrance, Othello has been secretly observing a bawdy discussion between Iago and Cassio about the latter's sexual exploits with a young woman. Thanks to Iago's impeccable planning (and some bad luck), neither speaker mentions the name of the woman in question; it is in fact Bianca, but Othello tragically assumes it to be his wife, Desdemona. Bianca suddenly enters, and her suspicions of Cassio are even greater than before. She is convinced that the handkerchief belongs to another woman, and throws it contemptuously at Cassio's feet. In Othello's eyes, her apparent jealousy confirms his wife's infidelity. This "evidence" completes Iago's manufactured case against Desdemona, and thereafter Othello is determined to murder both her and Cassio.

In 5.1, Bianca arrives just after Cassio has been stabbed by Iago.  She reacts with horror and concern.  Iago, pretending to have just entered the scene, accuses Bianca of having been part of the group that attacked Cassio.  Iago claims her emotional reaction is due to her being caught rather than concern for Cassio and gets her to admit that Cassio ate at her home earlier that evening.  Both Iago and Emilia call her a prostitute, but Bianca replies "I am no strumpet; but of life as honest / as you that doth abuse me" (5.1.122-3).  She is led off at the end of the scene to be questioned about the attack and is not mentioned again in the play.

== In film and television ==
In film, [[Doris Dowling]] played the character in [[Orson Welles]]'s troubled but critically acclaimed [[Othello (1952 film)|1952 adaptation]]. In 1965, [[Sheila Reid]] portrayed Bianca in [[Laurence Olivier]]'s [[Othello (1965 British film)|1965 version]], and [[Indra Ové]] played the character in the [[Othello (1995 film)|1995 feature film]] starring [[Laurence Fishburne]].  Bianca was renamed "Brandy" and played by [[Rachel Shumate]] in ''[[O (film)|O]]'', a retelling of the story set in a contemporary high school. In the 2006 [[Hindi]] film adaptation ''[[Omkara (2006 film)|Omkara]]'', the character was renamed "Billo Chamanbahar" and played by [[Bipasha Basu]]. In this variation, the Bianca character is not given a handkerchief, but a jewelled belt called a kamarbandh.

On television, [[Betsy Blair]] played the character in a 1955 [[BBC]] adaptation with [[Gordon Heath]] as Othello and [[Rosemary Harris]] as Desdemona.  [[Wendy Morgan (actress)|Wendy Morgan]] played Bianca in 1981 in the critically acclaimed BBC complete Shakespeare series.  The character was renamed "Lulu" and played by [[Rachael Stirling]] in an award winning modern English [[telemovie]] first broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] on 23 December 2001.

{{About|heraldry|the term used in Romantic poetry|Blason}}
{{Refimprove|date=June 2009}}
{{Heraldic achievement}}
In [[heraldry]] and heraldic [[vexillology]], a '''blazon''' is a formal description of a [[coat of arms]], [[flag]] or similar [[emblem]], from which the reader can reconstruct the appropriate image. The verb ''to blazon'' means to create such a description. The visual depiction of a coat of arms or flag has traditionally had considerable latitude in design, but a verbal blazon specifies the essentially distinctive elements. A coat of arms or flag is therefore primarily defined not by a picture but rather by the wording of its blazon (though in modern usage flags are often additionally and more precisely defined using geometrical specifications). ''Blazon'' also refers to the specialized language in which a blazon is written, and, as a verb, to the act of writing such a description. This language has its own [[vocabulary]], [[grammar]] and [[syntax]], which becomes essential for comprehension when blazoning a complex coat of arms.

Other armorial objects and devices – such as [[badge]]s, [[banner]]s, and [[Seal (emblem)|seal]]s – may also be described in blazon.

The noun and verb ''blazon'' (referring to a verbal description) are not to be confused with the noun ''emblazonment'', or the verb ''to emblazon'', both of which relate to the graphic representation of a coat of arms or heraldic device.

==Etymology==
The word ''blazon'' is derived from French ''blason'', "shield". It is found in English by the end of the 14th century.&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{OED|blazon, n. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly, heraldic authorities believed that the word was related to the German verb ''blasen'', "to blow (a horn)".&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 9th. ed., vol.11, p.683, "Heraldry"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Blazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Present-day lexicographers reject this theory as conjectural and disproved.&lt;ref name="oed" /&gt;

==Grammar==
Blazon is generally designed to eliminate ambiguity of interpretation, to be as concise as possible, and to avoid repetition and extraneous punctuation. English [[antiquarian]] [[Charles Boutell]] stated in 1864: 

{{quote|''Heraldic language'' is most concise, and it is always minutely exact, definite, and explicit; all unnecessary words are omitted, and all repetitions are carefully avoided; and, at the same time, every detail is specified with absolute precision. The nomenclature is equally significant, and its aim is to combine definitive exactness with a brevity that is indeed [[laconic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Boutell|Boutell, Charles]], [https://archive.org/details/heraldryhistoric01bout ''Heraldry, Historical and Popular''], 3rd edition, London, 1864, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, [[John Brooke-Little]], [[Norroy and Ulster King of Arms]], wrote in 1985: "Although there are certain conventions as to how arms shall be blazoned ... many of the supposedly hard and fast rules laid down in heraldic manuals [including those by heralds] are often ignored."&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Brooke-Little: ''An Heraldic Alphabet''; new and revised edition, p.&amp;nbsp;52. London: Robson Books, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

A given coat of arms may be drawn in many different ways, all considered equivalent and faithful to the blazon, just as the letter "A" may be printed in many different [[font]]s while still being the same letter. For example, the shape of the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] is almost always immaterial, with very limited exceptions (e.g., the [[coat of arms of Nunavut]], for which a round shield is specified).

The main conventions of blazon are as follows:
* Every blazon of a coat of arms begins by describing the [[field (heraldry)|field]] (background), with the first letter capitalised, followed by a [[comma]] ",". In a majority of cases this is a single [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]]; e.g. ''[[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]]'' (blue).
* If the field is complex, the [[variation of the field|variation]] is described, followed by the tinctures used; e.g. ''Chequy gules and argent'' (checkered red and white).
* If the shield is [[division of the field|divided]], the division is described, followed by the tinctures of the subfields, beginning with the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] side (shield bearer's right, but viewer's left) of the ''chief'' (upper) edge; e.g. ''Party per pale argent and vert'' (dexter half silver, [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] half green), or ''[[Quartering (heraldry)|Quarterly]] argent and gules'' (clockwise from viewer's top left, i.e. ''dexter chief'': white, red, white, red). In the case of a divided shield, it is common for the word "party" or "parted" to be omitted (e.g., ''Per pale argent and vert, a tree eradicated counterchanged'').
* Some authorities prefer to capitalise the names of tinctures and charges, but this convention is far from universal. Where tinctures are not capitalised, an exception may be made for the metal ''[[Or (heraldry)|Or]]'', in order to avoid confusion with the English word "or". Where space is at a premium, tincture names may be abbreviated: e.g., ''ar.'' for ''[[argent]]'', ''gu.'' for ''[[gules]]'', ''az.'' for ''[[Azure (heraldry)|azure]]'', ''sa.'' for ''[[Sable (heraldry)|sable]]'', and ''purp.'' for ''[[purpure]]''. 
* Following the description of the field, the principal [[Ordinary (heraldry)|ordinary]] or ordinaries and [[charge (heraldry)|charge]](s) are named, with their tincture(s); e.g., ''a [[bend (heraldry)|bend]] [[Or (heraldry)|or]].''
* The principal ordinary or charge is followed by any other charges placed on or around it. If a charge is a bird or a beast, its [[attitude (heraldry)|attitude]] is defined, followed by the creature's tincture, followed by anything that may be differently coloured; e.g. ''An eagle '''displayed''' gules '''armed''' and wings charged with trefoils or'' (see the [[coat of arms of Brandenburg]] below).
* ''[[Tincture (heraldry)#Counterchanging|Counterchanged]]'' means that a charge which straddles a line of division is given the same tinctures as the divided field, but reversed (see the arms of Behnsdorf below).
* A [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartered]] (composite) shield is blazoned one quarter (panel) at a time, proceeding by rows from chief (top) to base, and within each row from dexter (the right side of the bearer holding the shield) to sinister; in other words, from the viewer's left to right.   
* Following the description of the shield, any additional components of the [[Achievement (heraldry)|achievement]] – such as [[crown (heraldry)|crown]]/[[coronet]], [[helmet (heraldry)|helmet]], [[torse]], [[mantling]], [[crest (heraldry)|crest]], [[motto]], [[supporter]]s and [[compartment (heraldry)|compartment]] – are described in turn, using the same terminology and syntax.
* A convention often followed historically was to name a tincture explicitly only once within a given blazon. If the same tincture was found in different places within the arms, this was addressed either by ordering all elements of like tincture together prior to the tincture name (e.g., ''Argent, two chevrons and a canton gules''); or by naming the tincture only at its first occurrence, and referring to it at subsequent occurrences obliquely, for example by use of the phrase "of the field" (e.g., ''Argent, two chevrons and on a canton gules a lion passant of the field''); or by reference to its numerical place in the sequence of named tinctures (e.g., ''Argent, two chevrons and on a canton gules a lion passant of the first'': in both these examples, the lion is ''argent''). However, these conventions are now avoided by the [[College of Arms]] in London, and by most other formal granting bodies, as they may introduce ambiguity to complex blazons.&lt;ref name="CoA style"&gt;{{cite web |title=Blazon in CoA |work=CoA: The Coat of Arms |url=http://www.the-coat-of-arms.co.uk/blazon-in-coa/ |accessdate=26 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is common to print all heraldic blazons in [[Italic type|italic]].&lt;ref name="CoA style"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boutell 1864, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Heraldry has its own vocabulary, word-order and punctuation, and presenting it in italics indicates to the reader the use of a quasi-foreign language.

===French vocabulary and grammar===
Because heraldry developed at a time when English clerks wrote in [[Anglo-Norman French]], many terms in English heraldry are of French origin. Some of the details of the syntax of blazon also follow French practice: thus, [[adjective]]s are normally placed after [[noun]]s rather than before. 

A number of heraldic adjectives may be given in either a French or an anglicised form: for example, a ''[[cross pattée]]'' or a ''cross patty''; a ''[[cross fitchée]]'' or a ''cross fitchy''. In modern English blazons, the anglicised form tends to be preferred.&lt;ref name="CoA style"/&gt;

Where the French form is used, a problem may arise as to the appropriate adjectival ending, determined in normal French usage by gender and number.
{{quote|To describe two hands as ''appaumées'', because the word ''main'' is feminine in French, savours somewhat of pedantry. A person may be a good armorist, and a tolerable French scholar, and still be uncertain whether an escallop-shell covered with [[bezant]]s should be blazoned as bezanté or bezantée.&lt;ref name="Cussans p47"&gt;{{cite book |first=John E. |last=Cussans |authorlink=John Edwin Cussans |title=The Handbook of Heraldry |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |place=London |edition=2nd |year=1874 |page=47 |url=https://archive.org/stream/handbookofherald00cuss_0#page/n51/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[John Edwin Cussans|J. E. Cussans]] recommended spelling all French adjectives in the masculine singular, without regard to the gender and number of the nouns they qualify; but believed that a more usual convention was to adhere to the feminine singular form, for example: ''a chief undée'' and  ''a saltire undée'', even though the French nouns ''chef'' and ''sautoir'' are in fact masculine.&lt;ref name="Cussans p47"/&gt;

==Complexity==
Full descriptions of shields range in complexity, from a single word to a convoluted series describing compound shields:
*Arms of [[Brittany]]: ''Ermine''
*''Azure, a Bend Or'', over which the families of [[Scrope]] and [[Duke of Westminster|Grosvenor]] fought a famous legal battle (see [[Scrope v. Grosvenor]] and image above).
*Arms of [[Östergötland]], [[Sweden]]: ''Gules, a Griffin with dragon wings tail and tongue [[Attitude (heraldry)#Rampant|rampant]] Or armed beaked langued and membered Azure between four Roses Argent''.
*Arms of [[Hungary]] dating from 1867, when part of [[Austria-Hungary]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''Quarterly I. Azure three Lions' Heads affronté Crowned Or (for [[Dalmatia]]); II. [[chequy]] [[Argent]] and [[Gules]] (for [[Croatia]]); III. Azure a River in Fess Gules bordered Argent thereon a Marten proper beneath a [[six-pointed star]] Or (for [[Slavonia]]); IV. per Fess Azure and Or over all a Bar Gules in the Chief a demi-Eagle Sable displayed addextré of the Sun-in-splendour and senestré of a Crescent Argent in the Base seven Towers three and four Gules (for [[Transylvania]]); enté en point Gules a double-headed Eagle proper on a Peninsula Vert holding a Vase pouring Water into the Sea Argent beneath a Crown proper with bands Azure (for [[Fiume]]); over all an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] Barry of eight Gules and Argent impaling Gules on a Mount Vert a Crown Or issuant therefrom a double-Cross Argent (for [[Hungary]])''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Velde |first=François |title=Hungary |work=Heraldry by Countries |date=August 1998 |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/national/hungary.htm |accessdate=2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Chicago Society of Etchers''' was founded in January 1910, the first organization of etchers in the country. There were 20 members to start and by 1930 there were 150 members. Membership extended outside of the United States, including artists from England, France, Italy, Germany, Sweden, India, China and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.artic.edu/sites/default/files/libraries/pubs/1930/AIC1930AmEtch20thAn_comb.pdf | title=An Exhibition of Etchings | publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago | year=1930 |page=4 | accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1909, to popularize the medium of etching, [[Bertha Jaques]] and other etchers in Chicago formed the Needle Club, an informal collective of etchers passionate about reintroducing the American public to the art of etching.&lt;ref&gt;Joby Patterson, ''Bertha E. Jaques and the Chicago Society of Etchers,'' Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2002, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910 it became the Chicago Society of Etchers. The organization was primarily responsible for showing members’ etchings at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. It attracted international members and was successful at popularizing etching in 20th-century America.&lt;ref&gt;Joby Patterson, ''Bertha E. Jaques and the Chicago Society of Etchers,'' Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2002 p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Society members pooled funds for annual prizes for new prints, to be gifted to the Art Institute, and tithed ten percent of their dues to the museum for new print acquisitions. The group disbanded in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Engelbrecht, Theresa Moir.

===[[Chinese Literature]]===

The word "[[literature]]" has two meanings. In a narrower sense it means belles-lettres, writings done with a purpose of entertainment, leisure, self-expression, and so on, like poems, novels, letters, or diaries. In a broader sense, like it is treated here, "literature" means everything that has been written, including philosophical writings, scientific treatises, political writings, geography, inscriptions on tomb stones, or documents of court politics.&lt;ref&gt;

Chinaknowledge provides four different search tools to readers:

* Literature from A to Z
* Literature by time, Literature by theme
* Literature by the four categories
* Terms in Chinese literature

===[[Chinese History]]===
This section of the Chinaknowledge Encyclopedia deals with Chinese history from the beginnings to the [[People's Republic of China]]. It is organised in the traditional, and still common, way of regarding Chinese history from the viewpoint of dynasties. Each dynasty or dynastic period is explained in terms of event history, the history of administration and government, economic history, the history of philosophy and literature during the respective periods, religion, technology and inventions, as well as the history of arts. Literature, philosophy, arts and religions in general are described in detail in the respective parts of this encyclopedia. For each historical period, detailed information is given about the rulers and the geography of their realm.&lt;ref&gt;

===[[Chinese Language]] and [[Chinese Characters]]===
With 1.5 billion speakers, the Chinese language is the most spoken language of the world. It is nevertheless one single language that is spoken in the same form in all parts of China, nor has it been unchanged over time. The script by which the Chinese language is written is an ideographic script embedded into clouds of mystery. It is an obstacle for education and literacy and has nevertheless been used for a vast treasury of literature. And it has provided an example for the scripts of neighbouring states. This part of the encyclopedia provides an introduction into important aspects of both the Chinese language and the Chinese script.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Church of St. Lawrence''' ({{lang-fi|Vantaan Pyhän Laurin kirkko}}; {{lang-sv|Helsinge kyrka S:t Lars}}) is a church in [[Vantaa]], [[Finland]]. 
Dating back to ca. 1450, it is the oldest building in Vantaa and all of [[Greater Helsinki]].&lt;ref name="VS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vantaanseurakunnat.fi/pyhan-laurin-kirkko |title=Pyhän Laurin kirkko |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Vantaan Seurakunnat |publisher=Vantaan seurakunnat |language=Finnish |access-date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the main church of the Tikkurila Parish. Along with its surrounding neighborhood, the church is a part of the [[Helsingin pitäjän kirkonkylä]] [[Districts of Vantaa|district]], which is one of the best preserved historical [[parish]]es in all of Finland.&lt;ref name="Knapas"/&gt;

The Church of St. Lawrence was partially destroyed in a fire on 7 May 1893,&lt;ref name="Knapas"&gt;{{cite book |last=Knapas |first=Marja Terttu |date= |title= Vantaan Pyhän Laurin kirkko 500. Tutkielmia kirkon historiasta. |publisher=Vantaan seurakunnat. |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which it was reconstructed in a [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style.&lt;ref name="Knapas"/&gt;

==History==
The Church of St. Lawrence was built around the year 1450, though records suggest that a wooden equivalent stood in its position as early as 1401.&lt;ref name="VSen"/&gt; Prior to the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the introduction of [[Lutheranism]] into Finland, the church served the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. It was built as the church of Helsinki Parish, well before [[Helsinki]], the city, was founded in 1550. The parish village with its church was favorably located on a coastal road between [[Turku]] and [[Vyborg]]. A branch of the [[salmon]]-rich [[River Vantaa]] ran through the village as well.&lt;ref name="VSen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vantaanseurakunnat.fi/en/saintlawrence/ |title=The Church of St. Lawrence |author= |website=Vantaan Seurakunnat |publisher=Vantaan seurakunnat |access-date=30 April 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411023957/http://www.vantaanseurakunnat.fi/en/saintlawrence/ |archivedate=11 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burning of 1893===
On 7 May 1893, the church was largely destroyed by a [[conflagration]], leaving behind only its stone walls and [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]]. Reconstruction was overseen by the renowned Finnish architect Theodor Höijer, who opted to alter the appearance of the church by increasing the sizes of its windows and tending toward a [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style. The reconstruction, or as it was referred to, the restoration, was influenced by the cultural context of the late 1800s, during which [[Medieval architecture]] was gaining newfound respect in Finland.&lt;ref name="Knapas"/&gt;

The church was reopened in 1894, marking the then-believed 400 year anniversary of the building. More recently, the church has been recognized as older, by at least 50 years.

==Exterior==
The [[Facade|façade]] of the church is reminiscent of other Finnish medieval churches, such as the [[Porvoo Cathedral]]. The reason for the similarity is that many churches from that time period in southern Finland were designed by the same person, the anonymous ''Pernajan mestari'', who is presumed to be a German architect. The church has, however, been redesigned to some extent following the fire of 1893, leading to the current design being a mixture of [[Medieval architecture|Medieval]] and [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] architecture.&lt;ref name="Knapas"/&gt;

The façade features a biblical excerpt (from Psalms 84:10) in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: "''En dag i dina gårdar är bättre än eljest de tusende''" ({{lang-en|"For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand elsewhere"}}).

The roof of the church, prior to the fire, was a tarred [[Wood shingle#Shakes|shake wood shingle]] roof. After the reconstruction, it was made into a [[Copper in architecture#Roofing|copper roof]].&lt;ref name="LM"/&gt;
[[File:Vantaa church bell tower.jpg|thumb|left|The [[bell tower]].]]

===Bell tower===
The Church of St. Lawrence has an external [[bell tower]] located next to the front of the building. It was completely destroyed in 1893 and rebuilt in a style similar to the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style of the church building. The tower has two bells, and its roof is peaked by a [[flèche]] with a [[cockerel]] [[weather vane]].&lt;ref name="Knapas"/&gt;

===Graveyard===
[[File:Cronsted crave.JPG|thumb|The [[mausoleum]] of [[Carl Olof Cronstedt]].]]
The church is surrounded by a graveyard, which acts as the primary graveyard for the parishes of Vantaa. Up until 1793, the graveyard remained constrained to its original size, until an inspection deemed it too crowded. Since then, it has been regularly expanded to suit the needs of the growing population. The graveyard's current area is about {{convert|10|ha}}. Its most notable grave is the [[mausoleum]] of Swedish naval commander [[Carl Olof Cronstedt]].&lt;ref name="MTV"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv3.fi/matkailu/kotimaa/matkakohteet.shtml/652704?uusimaa |title=Pyhän Laurin kirkko on Suomen suosituin vihkipaikka |last=Halonen |first=Antti |date=1 June 2008 |website=mtv3.fi |publisher=MTV MEDIA |access-date=30 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515054505/http://www.mtv3.fi/matkailu/kotimaa/matkakohteet.shtml/652704?uusimaa |archive-date= 15 May 2011 |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior==
Prior to the fire of 1893, the church interior remained largely unchanged throughout the centuries. One change that took place was the treating of the inner walls with [[chalk]]; in the Middle Ages, the walls were decorated with Medieval paintings, but by the 18th century, the walls were chalked white. The fire revealed several pre-Reformation paintings on the church [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]], though contemporaries deemed the paintings artistically worthless and "primitive". Before being painted over again, the art historian Emil Nervander made replica paintings of them, which are currently stored by the [[Finnish National Board of Antiquities]].&lt;ref name="Knapas"/&gt;

The main [[stained glass]] window of the church was completed after the 1893 fire. It depicts [[Jesus]] comforting a [[pilgrim]].

In 1853, the church received its first [[pipe organ]]. Though destroyed in 1893, the replacement organ replicated the visual appearance of the original. It was adapted for electrical power in the 1930s. The current organ was built in 1976, though it adapts the front of the 1800s design for visual similarity.&lt;ref name="MTV"/&gt;

The '''coat of arms of [[East Timor]]''' (officially: Timor-Leste) is one of the [[national symbols]] of East Timor.

==History==
Was introduced on 18 January 2007 under the Law 02/2007. It is based on a design first used when the country [[Unilateral declaration of independence|unilaterally declared independence]] on 28 November 1975.

The [[motto]] in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is "''Unidade, Acção, Progresso''" ("Unity, Action, Progress").

==Description==
On the centre of the coat of arms, there a curved pyramid with red edges and black core, symbolise [[Mount Ramelau]], the highest peak in Timor Leste. On the black field in the centre there is a five-pointed star with five rays of light. Under it there is an open red book rest upon a yellow industrial gear. On the left side there is a rice ear (''hare fulin'') and on the right side there is a corn ear (''batar fulin''). Under the industrial gear there is an [[AK-47]] assault rifle, bow and arrows (''rama inan''). Under the Mount Ramelau there is a ribbon banner written in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''"Unidade, Acção, Progresso"'' ("Union, Action, Progress"). Around the emblem there is a circle band written with the official name of the state in Portuguese:  ''"República Democrática de Timor-Leste"'' (Democratic Republic of East Timor), and the acronym is written under "RDTL".

==Previous emblems==

=== Portuguese colonisation (1935–1975) ===

The arms of [[Portuguese Timor]] followed the same format of other [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonies]] (later overseas provinces) with the territory being represented by the black and white Dominican cross in recognition of the role played by the [[Dominican Order]] in converting the East Timorese to Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flagspot.net/flags/tl!1967.html East Timor: flag proposal of 1967&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indonesian occupation (1975–1999) ===

[[Indonesia]] [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invaded East Timor]] in 1975 and annexed it the following year as its 27th province of Timor Timur. During this period, [[Timor Timur]] had its own coat of arms which remained in use until Indonesia rescinded its annexation in 1999. The arms consisted of a golden shield containing wreaths of wheat and cotton enclosing a blue [[roundel]] containing a stylised traditional East Timor house. This was surmounted by a blue shield depicting a gold star representing the [[monotheism|faith in one God]]. Below the roundel appeared a traditional Timorese headdress (Kaibauk) bearing the inscription "Timor Timur".

=== United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (1999–2002)===

The seal used by the United Nations [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor|Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET)]] depicted an outline of the island of [[Timor]], a crocodile, traditional head-dress and tais patterns. The seal included the words ''Timor Lorosa’e'' and ''Governu'' in [[Tetum]] or ''Timor Leste'' and ''Governo'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

=== First coat of arms (2002–2007) ===

The first coat of arms contains the shield of the ''[[Conselho Nacional de Resistência Timorense]]'' (National Council of Timorese Resistance). The main elements are two crossed ''[[Surik (sword)|Suriks]]'' (traditional Timorese swords), together with a spear, a star, and two arrows. The country's title, in Portuguese, is on a blue ring around the shield and a sun with 14 rays. The motto in the banner translates as: "Honour, Homeland, and People".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1879">The '''Committee on Conservation of Cultural Assets in Turkey''' ({{lang-tr|Kültür Varlıkları Koruma Kurulu}}) is a province-based governmental committee responsible for the conservation of [[cultural heritage]] in Turkey.

==History==
In 1933, a department was founded within the [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Ministry of National Education]] for the conservation of the ruins of antiquity. After the establishment of the [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism]] in 1971, the department became an office of this new ministry. Following a series of name changes, finally in 200, it was renamed "Cultural Assets and Museums Department" ({{lang-tr|Kültür Varlıkları ve Müzeler Genel Müdürlüğü}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulturvarliklari.gov.tr/TR,43034/tarihce.html Page of the department {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The Committees on Conservation of Cultural Assets are province-based subdivisions of this department at the ministry. (''see'' [[SİT areas in Turkey]])

==List of committees==
Currently, there are 34 provincial committees:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulturvarliklari.gov.tr/TR,43078/kultur-varliklarini-koruma-bolge-kurulu-mudurlukleri.html Committee list]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SVForm.jpg|120px|right]]
In the early 1980s, the opportunities for designers in Sweden were scarce. Few companies had realized the importance of consulting a designer. The chairman of the designers section of [[Svensk Form]], [[Hans-Christer Ericson]], then presented the idea  of a design prize, to be awarded to various professional design organizations and their producers. In 1983 the first jury presented their choice, and after that the prize was handed out every year until 2002. The graphic designers (ABCD, now Sveriges Reklamförbund), the industrial designers (SID), the interior architects (SIR), the craftsmen (KIF), the illustrators (FST) and the textile and fashion designers (STOK) every time chose their representative for the jury. In later years, web design and corporate identity were also awarded. Excellent Swedish Design, with its logo designed by Hans-Christer Ericson, became a huge media success, both in Sweden and abroad.

==Plot==
&lt;!--As per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], this section should be between 400 and 700 words.--&gt;
Aspiring model Meghna Mathur ([[Priyanka Chopra]]) wants to go to Mumbai and become a supermodel. Against her father's wishes who wants her to become an accountant, Meghna leaves her home to find success in the modelling world. Meghna meets an old acquaintance, Rohit ([[Ashwin Mushran]]){{mdash}}a gay, aspiring designer who assists Vinay Khosla ([[Harsh Chhaya]]). Meghna experiences difficulties during her early days; she auditions several times and is rejected. Meghna meets and befriends another struggling model, Maanav ([[Arjan Bajwa]]).

At Rahul Arora's ([[Samir Soni]]) fashion show, Meghna meets supermodel Shonali Gujral ([[Kangana Ranaut]]) and is ridiculed by the show's choreographer, Christine, and told to have her portfolio photographed by Kartik ([[Rohit Roy]]). To afford Kartik's fees, Meghna shoots a lingerie advertisement; she is mentored by another aspiring model, Janet ([[Mugdha Godse]]). Meghna's lingerie photos appear on the cover of a magazine; her relatives in Mumbai see the cover and ask her to leave the house. She moves into an apartment with Maanav. Meghna is noticed by Anisha Roy ([[Kitu Gidwani]]), an executive at Panache, a major modeling agency. Anisha introduces her to her superior, Abhijit Sarin ([[Arbaaz Khan (Indian actor)|Arbaaz Khan]]), who is impressed by Meghna's ambition and confidence. Panache's top model is Shonali, but her drug abuse becomes problematic. Abhijit includes Meghna in a fashion show organised by Vinay Khosla, but is replaced after a misunderstanding. Abhijit consoles her, and decides to replace Shonali with Meghna as Panache's new top model.

Meghna becomes an overnight success, ends her relationship with Maanav and begins an affair with Abhijit. Meanwhile, Janet goes to work for designer Rahul Arora. Rahul's mother becomes increasingly concerned about his sexual orientation so he asks Janet to marry him. Shonali's drug abuse worsens and she attends a rehabilitation clinic. Meghna pays the price of her increasing fame by losing her close friends due to her changed attitude towards them. She becomes pregnant with Abhijit's child, and reluctantly has an abortion due to conditions in her contract. After realizing that she was deceived in her relationship, Meghna tells Abhijit's wife about their relationship, and Abhijit ends Meghna's contract with Panache. Upset at the turn of events, Meghna descends into alcoholism; at a rave party she uses cocaine and unwittingly has a one-night stand. When sober, she feels guilty and returns to her parents in [[Chandigarh]].

Broken and depressed, Meghna lives in Chandigarh for over a year. Her father encourages her to return to Mumbai; Meghna rekindles her friendship with Janet and models for Rohit's show, where she freezes on the ramp after seeing the lights and cameras. She visits Maanav (now an established model) to apologize and learns that he is engaged. Shonali appears on television as a mentally ill, homeless alcoholic; Meghna takes her in and tries to rehabilitate her. Meghna accepts an offer from Rahul to be the star model of his show, but a day before the show Shonali vanishes. Just before Meghna walks the ramp, she receives a call from the police telling her that Shonali is dead from a drug overdose. Meghna freezes; overcoming her grief, she walks the ramp, reviving her career and restoring her self-confidence. Meghna gives up drinking and smoking, and as the film closes she walks the ramp in [[Paris]].

===Development===
In a 2006 interview with [[CNN-IBN]], Madhur Bhandarkar said that he was preparing to make a film about the fashion industry; he thought the lack of Indian films on this subject prompted him to do so.&lt;ref name="ci"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashion next on Madhur's film list |url=http://content.ibnlive.in.com/article/03-Sep-2006movies-news/fashion-next-on-madhurs-film-list-20489-8.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130615235851/http://content.ibnlive.in.com/article/03-Sep-2006movies-news/fashion-next-on-madhurs-film-list-20489-8.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 June 2013 |author=Sengupta, Hindol |publisher=[[CNN-IBN]] |date=4 September 2006 |accessdate=27 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he was fascinated with the industry, the models and their lives outside the ramp walks, saying "I was amazed at the overwhelming attention given to the fashion Industry by the media and the public. I thought the idea of delving deep into the fashion world was very interesting and intriguing."&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rediff"&gt;{{cite web|title='Kangana's role is not based on Geetanjali's life' |url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/oct/27mb.htm |author=Chaudhary, Swati R |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |date=27 October 2008 |accessdate=1 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928050537/http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/oct/27mb.htm |archivedate=28 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was excited about depicting the people behind the ramp because most people are unfamiliar with  the fashion world.&lt;ref name="rediff"/&gt;

Bhandarkar, who is known for studying his subject matter to make his films as realistic as possible, researched the fashion industry for nearly eight months, attending fashion events and shows.&lt;ref name="ci"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rediff"/&gt; He spoke with designers, buyers, choreographers and models.&lt;ref name="int"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashion will be my last woman-oriented film |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/Entertainment/Fashion-will-be-my-last-woman-oriented-film/Article1-255865.aspx |author=Jha, Subhash K. |work=[[Hindustan Times]] |date=5 November 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005111222/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/Entertainment/Fashion-will-be-my-last-woman-oriented-film/Article1-255865.aspx |archivedate= 5 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bhandarkar researching for film on fashion fraternity |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1121950671.html |work=Hindustan Times |publisher=Accessed by [[Highbeam Research]] |date=4 September 2006 |accessdate=27 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402151338/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1121950671.html |archivedate= 2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond the ramp... |url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2008/10/31/stories/2008103150050100.htm |author=Zaman, Rana Siddiqui |work=[[The Hindu]] |date=31 October 2008 |accessdate=2 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928063043/http://www.hindu.com/fr/2008/10/31/stories/2008103150050100.htm |archivedate=28 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several media publications reported that the film was inspired by the lives of fashion models such as Shivani Kapur, Geetanjali Nagpal, [[Kate Moss]] and Alicia Raut; however, Bhandarkar stated that the story is fictional and does not resemble anyone's life.&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Madhur's attempt to be realistic|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-06-30/news-interviews/27758076_1_drug-abuse-priyanka-chopra-blood-test|author=Lalwani, Vickey|work=The Times of India|date=30 June 2008|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media also reported that the film revolved around two homosexual fashion designers; Bhandarkar denied these rumours, saying the film did not revolve around male characters but had female protagonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bhandarkar's Fashion isn't about two gay designers |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/Entertainment/Bhandarkar-s-Fashion-isn-t-about-two-gay-designers/Article1-252783.aspx |agency=[[Indo-Asian News Service]] |work=Hindustan Times |date=16 October 2007 |accessdate=2 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005111226/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/Entertainment/Bhandarkar-s-Fashion-isn-t-about-two-gay-designers/Article1-252783.aspx |archivedate=5 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casting began in October 2007, when Priyanka Chopra signed to play the lead role in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Priyanka Chopra bags lead role in Madhur's film|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-10-06/news-interviews/27961905_1_priyanka-chopra-bags-madhur-bhandarkar-indian-films|author=Buragohain, Gautam|work=The Times of India|date=6 October 2007|accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chopra initially refused the role, feeling she would not be able to do it justice.

Chopra said she studied method acting to make her character seem real.&lt;ref name="midday"/&gt; The actress said that her character is determined and added, "While her father wants her to become an accountant she aspires to become the leading model in fashion industry".&lt;ref name="Chopra/OutlookIndia"&gt;{{cite web|title='Fashion' is Madhur's most positive film: Priyanka Chopra |url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newswire/story/fashion-is-madhurs-most-positive-film-priyanka-chopra/626223|work=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]] |date=29 October 2008 |accessdate=2 June 2013|archiveurl=https://www.outlookindia.com/newswire/story/fashion-is-madhurs-most-positive-film-priyanka-chopra/626223|archivedate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing rumours that the film was an exposé of the fashion industry, she said, "It is nothing like that.

Rita Dhody and Narendra Kumar were chosen to style the film's characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Priyanka is happy!|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-12-26/news-interviews/27963371_1_priyanka-chopra-dress-designer-duggu-and-i-shot|work=The Times of India|date=26 December 2007|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhody said it took nearly two months for UTV and Bhandarkar to persuade her to help design the film; she found the job challenging because she had to make everything as authentic as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The movie isn’t about a good skirt |url=http://www.punemirror.in/article/55/20081102200811020358333666132a010/The-movie-isn%E2%80%99t-about-a-good-skirt.html?pageno=9 |author=Aggarwal, Veda |work=Pune Mirror |date=2 November 2008 |accessdate=26 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928071216/http://www.punemirror.in/article/55/20081102200811020358333666132a010/The-movie-isn%E2%80%99t-about-a-good-skirt.html?pageno=9 |archivedate=28 September 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chopra had to wear 137 costumes in the film because her character passed through five phases.&lt;ref name="midday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="midday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="styling"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Fashion stars were styled... |url=http://www.masala.com/7700-how-fashion-stars-were-styled |agency=Indo-Asian News Service |work=Masala |accessdate=2 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927081250/http://www.masala.com/7700-how-fashion-stars-were-styled |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, she was a "hep" character with brightly coloured, matching attire. Her make-up becomes lighter as she becomes a model and later a supermodel. When her career falters, Chopra's look becomes softer, demonstrating her character's lack of concern about her appearance before she returns to Mumbai.&lt;ref name="styling"/&gt; According to Dhody, Chopra's look is "very contemporary and a very much today's look, but my idea was to streamline and take it to the classic side [rather] than making it trend-based".&lt;ref name="styling"/&gt;

Ranaut's character was designed to make audiences feel sympathy for her.&lt;ref name="styling" /&gt; Dhody gave her short dresses with low necklines, conveying the image of a supermodel comfortable with her body; during her low phase, she is shown in long T-shirts.&lt;ref name="styling" /&gt;

Godse, whose character is a failed model, has a carefree look. Dhody said, "Godse's look in the film is a fusion of rock and a grunge to give her the survivor look as a B-grade model, making her more chic and glamorous."&lt;ref name="styling" /&gt; She wears low-waisted trousers, chains and ankle boots. Details of jewellery, clothes, colour and accessories outline the characters; everything had to be sychronised and complement each other to create an authentic look.&lt;ref name="styling" /&gt; Dhody said, "We didn't try to sensationalise it by making it more bling- or costume-based. I had to restrain myself from going overboard due to Bhandarkar's reservations".&lt;ref name="styling" /&gt; The film's narrative included 11 character-based ramp shows.&lt;ref name="styling" /&gt;

==Marketing and release==
The film's trailer was unveiled on 17 July 2008 in Mumbai and was received warmly by critics and audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Madhur Bhandarkar’s ‘Fashion’ unveiled in Mumbai |url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/madhur-bhandarkar-s-fashion-unveiled-in-mumbai_5844.htm |publisher=Zee News |date=17 July 2008 |accessdate=2 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607210915/http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/madhur-bhandarkar-s-fashion-unveiled-in-mumbai_5844.htm |archivedate= 7 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasizing its theme, the lead female cast walked the ramp at fashion shows to promote the film. ''Fashion'' was also promoted at the Lakme Fashion Week, where Chopra, Ranaut and Godse walked the ramp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lakme Fashion Week gets off to weak start in Mumbai |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/Lakme+Fashion+Week+gets+off+to+weak+start+in+Mumbai/1/18182.html |author=Motihar, Jhilmil |work=[[India Today]] |date=20 October 2008 |accessdate=3 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402113306/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/Lakme%20Fashion%20Week%20gets%20off%20to%20weak%20start%20in%20Mumbai/1/18182.html |archivedate= 2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Made on a budget of {{INRConvert|180|m|nolink=yes}}, ''Fashion'' earned {{INRConvert|85|m|nolink=yes}}, and before release recouped half its cost from tie-ins with brands including [[Reebok]], [[Lenovo]], [[Sunsilk]] and [[LG|LG Electronics]]. Products from these brands were showcased in the film and the brands promoted the film in their advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Fashion' earns Rs.85 mn from in-film advertising |url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/009200810161632.htm |agency=[[Indo-Asian News Service]] |work=The Hindu |date=16 October 2008 |accessdate=31 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110135738/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/009200810161632.htm |archivedate=10 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhandarkar expressed disappointment about the [[Central Board of Film Certification|Censor Board for Film Certification]]'s decision to grant the film an "[[Central Board of Film Certification#Current certificates|A]]" certificate{{mdash}}meant for viewers 18 years or older{{mdash}}instead of the "[[Central Board of Film Certification#Current certificates|U/A]]" certificate that he had expected. His previous films received U/A certification despite adult content. According to them, their new guidelines did not allow ''Fashion'' a U/A certification. The board was willing to issue a U/A certificate after several cuts; Bhandarkar refused and accepted the A certificate since the scenes in question were crucial to the narrative.&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt; Before its release, the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) asked Bhandarkar to screen the film before its release due to its concern that Ranaut's character was based on [[Geetanjali Nagpal]]{{mdash}}a former high-profile fashion model found begging, bedraggled and mentally unbalanced on the streets of Delhi in 2007.&lt;ref name="Buncombe/Indie"&gt;{{cite news|title=Flashback for a model who fell off the catwalk |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/flashback-for-a-model-who-fell-off-the-catwalk-980267.html |first=Andrew |last=Buncombe |work=The Independent |location=London |date=31 October 2008 |accessdate=27 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219233036/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/flashback-for-a-model-who-fell-off-the-catwalk-980267.html |archivedate=19 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nagpal was helped by the DCW, which did not want anyone profiting from her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Girl, interrupted |url=http://www.ahmedabadmirror.com/printarticle.aspx?page=comments&amp;action=add&amp;sectid=13&amp;contentid=2008102420081024022639161a87a9e7c&amp;subsite= |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130615235939/http://www.ahmedabadmirror.com/printarticle.aspx?page=comments&amp;action=add&amp;sectid=13&amp;contentid=2008102420081024022639161a87a9e7c&amp;subsite= |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 June 2013 |author=Lalwani, Vickey |work=Ahemdabad Mirror |date=24 October 2013 |accessdate=2 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhandarkar narrated a summary of the film's plot at the DCW office, which satisfied the commission that there was no reference to Nagpal.

==Reception==
''Fashion'' garnered generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its direction, screenplay, cinematography, music and performances. Kriti Verma of ''Headlines India'' rated the film 4 out of 5, describing it as "an outstanding film and a must watch for people who visit a theatre for something more than entertainment".&lt;ref name="headlines"/&gt; Zee News gave the film a rating of 4 out of 5, called it "a must watch" and praised the sets, music, performances and storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: Bhandarkar weaves ‘real fabric’ in ‘Fashion’ |url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/movies-and-theatre/review-bhandarkar-weaves-real-fabric-in-fashion_479590.html |publisher=Zee News |date=29 October 2008 |accessdate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003203236/http://zeenews.india.com/news/movies-and-theatre/review-bhandarkar-weaves-real-fabric-in-fashion_479590.html |archivedate= 3 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikhat Kazmi]] rated the film 3.5 out of 5, describing it as " a sensitive parable on bonding and empowerment".&lt;ref name="toir"/&gt; [[Taran Adarsh]] rated the film 3.5 out of 5, praised the cinematography, screenplay, dialogue, costumes and styling, and called ''Fashion'' a "hard-hitting film that enlightens you, moves you, motivates and deflates you, even shocks and surprises you and of course, entertains you".&lt;ref name="hungama"/&gt; [[Rajeev Masand]] gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5, and wrote, "''Fashion'' is an easy watch because the very subject lends itself to so much interest. Like the director’s own film ''Page 3'' it is mostly sensational and on several occasions compromises authenticity for the sake of exaggerated drama". He praised the performances of the lead cast, writing that "Chopra turns in a respectable performance, one that will inevitably go down as her best. The truth is, it’s one of those by-the-book characters that she understands only too well and performs just as easily. Ditto for Kangana Ranaut who plays the eccentric superdiva with such a practiced hand, it almost seems like an effortless delivery. It's&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;Godse who invests such sincerity into her role, that she makes the character a real flesh and blood person. Kitu Gidwani, as the agency head who mentors our protagonist, Kitu strikes all the right notes, never once slipping out of character."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Masand's Verdict: Fashion, no real expose |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/masands-verdict-fashion-is-all-masala-no-reality/77189-8-p1.html |author=Masand, Rajeev |publisher=CNN-IBN |date=1 November 2008 |accessdate=27 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009233701/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/masands-verdict-fashion-is-all-masala-no-reality/77189-8-p1.html |archivedate= 9 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subhash K. Jha of the [[Indo-Asian News Service]] rated the film 3 out of 5, calling it "a truly outstanding film". He said, "Bhandarkar takes us through a labyrinth of emotions, some devastating in their gut-level directness. But at the end, we come away with a film that gives us something to hold on to permanently even as the characters on screen lose practically everything worth holding on to". Jha also wrote that the sequences between Chopra and Ranaut as the highlights of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashion (Movie Review) |url=http://www.masala.com/8064-fashion-movie-review |author=Jha, Subhash K. |work=Masala |date=29 October 2008 |accessdate=27 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305014753/http://www.masala.com/8064-fashion-movie-review |archivedate= 5 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaurav Malani from ''[[The Economic Times]]'' rated the film a 3 out of 5, praised Chopra's performance and wrote, "Chopra's character graph [is] skillfully sketched from an aspiring model to an ambitious showstopper to a brash supermodel and subsequently to a faded manikin, desperate to make her comeback. In each phase her character exudes [a] contrasting gamut of emotions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashion: Movie Review|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2008-10-29/news/27734940_1_madhur-bhandarkar-priyanka-chopra-fashion|author=Malani, Gaurav|work=[[The Economic Times]]|date=29 October 2008|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khalid Mohamed]] rated ''Fashion'' 3 out of 5, called the film a "must-try", and wrote, "Excelling on the catwalk as well as in the moments of self-destruction, Ranaut’s is the terrific, show-stopping performance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Khalid's Fashion statement |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/KhalidMohamed/Khalid-s-Fashion-statement/Article1-348067.aspx |author=Mohamed, Khalid |work=Hindustan Times |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=1 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227010353/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/KhalidMohamed/Khalid-s-Fashion-statement/Article1-348067.aspx |archivedate=27 December 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonia Chopra of [[Sify]] criticised the film's superficial portrayal of the fashion industry and called the film a superficial take on the lives of models and a dumbed-down version of the workings of the fashion industry.

{{Feminism sidebar}}
Feminist literature is fiction, nonfiction, drama or poetry which supports the [[Feminism|feminist]] goals of defining, establishing and defending equal [[Civil and political rights|civil, political, economic]] and [[social rights]] for women. It often identifies women's roles as unequal to those of men – particularly as regards status, privilege and power – and generally portrays the consequences to women, men, families, communities and societies as undesirable.

== History ==

In the 15th Century [[Christine de Pizan]] wrote [[The Book of the City of Ladies]] which combats prejudices and enhances the importance of women in society. The book follow the model of [[De Mulieribus Claris]] written in the 14th Century by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]].	{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The feminist movement produced feminist fiction, feminist non-fiction, and feminist poetry, which created new interest in [[Women's writing (literary category)|women's writing]]. It also prompted a general reevaluation of women's [[Women's history|historical]] and academic contributions in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name=Blain&gt;{{cite book |author=Blain, Virginia |author2=Clements, Patricia |author3=Grundy, Isobel  |title=The feminist companion to literature in English: women writers from the Middle Ages to the present |year=1990 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-04854-4 |pages=vii–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been a close link between feminist literature and [[activism]], with feminist writing typically voicing key concerns or ideas of feminism in a particular era. 

Much of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. In Western feminist literary scholarship, Studies like [[Dale Spender]]'s ''Mothers of the Novel'' (1986) and Jane Spencer's ''The Rise of the Woman Novelist'' (1986) were ground-breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing. 

Commensurate with this growth in scholarly interest, various presses began the task of reissuing long-out-of-print texts. [[Virago Press]] began to publish its large list of 19th and early-20th-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation. In the 1980s Pandora Press, responsible for publishing Spender's study, issued a companion line of 18th-century novels written by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sandra M. |last=Gilbert |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE4DD1E3AF937A35756C0A960948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 |title=Paperbacks: From Our Mothers' Libraries: women who created the novel |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 May 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Broadview Press]] continues to issue 18th- and 19th-century novels, many hitherto out of print, and the [[University of Kentucky]] has a series of republications of early women's novels. 

Particular works of literature have come to be known as key feminist texts. ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'' (1929) by [[Virginia Woolf]], is noted in its argument for both a literal and figural space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by patriarchy.

The widespread interest in women's writing is related to a general reassessment and expansion of the [[literary canon]]. Interest in [[post-colonial literature]]s, [[LGBT literature|gay and lesbian literature]], writing by people of colour, working people's writing, and the cultural productions of other historically marginalized groups has resulted in a whole scale expansion of what is considered "literature", and genres hitherto not regarded as "literary", such as children's writing, journals, letters, travel writing, and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name="Blain" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Buck |editor1-first=Claire |title=The Bloomsbury Guide to Women's Literature |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1992 |page=vix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Salzman |first=Paul |chapter=Introduction |title=Early Modern Women's Writing |publisher=Oxford UP |year=2000 |pages=ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Literary genre|genres and subgenres]] have undergone a similar analysis, so literary studies has entered new territories such as the "[[Gothic fiction#The female Gothic and the supernatural explained|female gothic]]"&lt;ref&gt;Term coined by Ellen Moers in ''Literary Women: The Great Writers'' (New York: Doubleday, 1976). See also Juliann E. Fleenor, ed., ''The Female Gothic'' (Montreal: Eden Press, 1983) and Gary Kelly, ed., ''Varieties of Female Gothic'' 6 Vols. (London: Pickering &amp; Chatto, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Women in science fiction|women's science fiction]].

According to Elyce Rae Helford, "Science fiction and fantasy serve as important vehicles for feminist thought, particularly as bridges between theory and practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Helford, Elyce Rae |editor-first=Gary |editor-last=Westfahl |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy |chapter=Feminist Science Fiction |year=2005 |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0-300-04854-4 |pages=289–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist science fiction is sometimes taught at the university level to explore the role of social constructs in understanding gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15328023top1703_17 |title=Using Science Fiction to Teach the Psychology of Sex and Gender |year=1990 |last1=Lips |first1=Hilary M. |journal=Teaching of Psychology |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=197–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable texts of this kind are [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' (1969), [[Joanna Russ]]' ''[[The Female Man]]'' (1970), [[Octavia Butler]]'s ''[[Kindred (novel)|Kindred]]'' (1979) and [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[Handmaid's Tale]]'' (1985).

Feminist nonfiction has played an important role in voicing concerns about women's lived experiences. For example, [[Maya Angelou]]'s ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings|I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings]]'' was extremely influential, as it represented the specific racism and sexism experienced by black women growing up in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://feminisminindia.com/2018/08/10/i-know-why-the-caged-bird-sings-review-maya-angelou/|title=I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings: Angelou's Quest to Truth and Power|last=Shah|first=Mahvish|date=2018|website=Feminism in India|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition, many feminist movements have embraced [[poetry]] as a vehicle through which to communicate feminist ideas to public audiences through anthologies, poetry collections, and public readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/144696/a-change-of-world|title=A Change of World|last=Poetry Foundation|first=|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist children's literature==
{{main|Feminist children's literature}}
Feminist children's literature is the writing of [[children's literature]] through a feminist lens. Children's literature and [[women's literature]] have many similarities. Both often deal with being weak and placed towards the bottom of a hierarchy. In this way feminist ideas are regularly found in the structure of children's literature. Feminist criticism of children's literature is therefore expected, since it is a type of feminist literature.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nodelman|first1=Perry|title=Children's Literature as Women's Writing|journal=Children's Literature Association Quarterly|date=1988|volume=13.1|doi=10.1353/chq.0.0264|pages=31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist children's literature has played a critical role for the [[feminist movement]], especially in the past half century. In her book ''Feminism Is for Everybody: Passionate Politics'', [[bell hooks]]&lt;!-- Lower-case is correct.--&gt; states her belief that all types of media, including writing and children's books, need to promote feminist ideals. She argues "Children's literature is one of the most crucial sites for feminist education for critical consciousness precisely because beliefs and identities are still being formed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hooks|first1=Bell|title=Feminism Is for Everybody: Passionate Politics|date=2000|publisher=South End|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist science fiction==
{{Main|Feminist science fiction}}
Feminist science fiction is a subgenre of [[science fiction]] (abbreviated "SF") focused on theories that include [[feminist]] themes including but not limited to [[gender inequality]], [[sexuality]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[economics]], and [[reproduction]]. Feminist SF is political because of its tendency to critique the dominant culture. Some of the most notable feminist science fiction works have illustrated these themes using [[utopia]]s to explore a society in which gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist, or [[dystopias]] to explore worlds in which gender inequalities are intensified, thus asserting a need for feminist work to continue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA1"&gt;{{citation | last = Helford | first = Elyce Rae | contribution = Feminism | editor-last = Westfahl | editor-first = Gary | title = The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: themes, works and wonders | pages = 289–291 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780313329531 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=SQMQQyIaACYC&amp;pg=PA290 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|Science fiction and fantasy serve as important vehicles for feminist thought, particularly as bridges between theory and practice. No other genres so actively invite representations of the ultimate goals of feminism: worlds free of sexism, worlds in which women's contributions (to science) are recognized and valued, worlds that explore the diversity of women's desire and sexuality, and worlds that move beyond gender.|Elyce Rae Helford&lt;ref name="Helford, p.291"&gt;Helford, p.291.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This description of the '''history of [[aesthetics]] before the twentieth century''' is based on an article from the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]].

==Ancient Greek aesthetics==
The first important contributions to aesthetic theory are usually considered to stem from philosophers in [[Ancient Greece]], among which the most noticeable are [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]] and [[Plotinus]]. When interpreting writings from this time, it is worth noticing that it is debatable whether an exact equivalent to the term [[beauty]] existed in classical Greek.&lt;ref name="Konstan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Konstan|first1=David|title=Beauty - The Fortunes of an Ancient Greek Idea|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-992726-5|pages=30–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Xenophon]] regarded the beautiful as coincident with the good, while both of these concepts are resolvable into the useful.  Every beautiful object is so called because it serves some rational end: either the security or the gratification of man. Socrates rather emphasized the power of beauty to further the more necessary ends of life than the immediate gratification which a beautiful object affords to perception and contemplation.  His doctrine puts forward the relativity of beauty. [[Plato]], in contrast, recognized that beauty exists as an abstract ''[[Theory of Forms|F]][[Theory of Forms|orm]]''. It is therefore absolute and does not necessarily stand in relation to a percipient mind.

===Plato===
Of the views of [[Plato]] on the subject, it is hardly less difficult to gain a clear conception from the ''Dialogues'', than it is in the case of ethical good.  In some of these, various definitions of the beautiful are rejected as inadequate by the Platonic Socrates.  At the same time we may conclude that Plato's mind leaned decidedly to the conception of an absolute beauty, which took its place in his scheme of ideas or self-existing forms.  This true beauty is nothing discoverable as an attribute in another thing, for these are only beautiful things, not the beautiful itself.  Love ([[Eros (love)|Eros]]) produces aspiration towards this pure idea.  Elsewhere the soul's intuition of the self-beautiful is said to be a reminiscence of its prenatal existence.  As to the precise forms in which the idea of beauty reveals itself, Plato is not very decided.  His theory of an absolute beauty does not easily adjust itself to the notion of its contributing merely a variety of sensuous pleasure, to which he appears to lean in some dialogues.  He tends to identify the self-beautiful with the conceptions of the true and the good, and thus there arose the Platonic formula [[kalokagathia]]. So far as his writings embody the notion of any common element in beautiful objects, it is proportion, harmony or unity among their parts.  He emphasizes unity in its simplest aspect as seen in evenness of line and purity of color.  He recognizes in places the beauty of the mind, and seems to think that the highest beauty of proportion is to be found in the union of a beautiful mind with a beautiful body.  He had but a poor opinion of art, regarding it as a trick of imitation ([[mimesis]]) which takes us another step further from the luminous sphere of rational intuition into the shadowy region of the semblances of sense.  Accordingly, in his scheme for an ideal [[Republic (dialogue)|republic]], he provided for the most inexorable censorship of poets, etc., so as to make art as far as possible an instrument of moral and political training.

An example of Plato's considerations about poetry is: "For the authors of those great poems which we admire, do not attain to excellence through the rules of any art; but they utter their beautiful melodies of verse in a state of inspiration, and, as it were, possessed by a spirit not their own."&lt;ref&gt;Plato. Ion Or: On the Iliad&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle===
[[Aristotle]], in contrast to Plato, developed certain principles of beauty and art, most clearly so in his treatises on poetry and rhetoric. He saw the absence of all lust or desire in the pleasure it bestows as another characteristic of the beautiful. Aristotle finds (in the ''Metaphysics'') the universal elements of beauty to be order (taxis), symmetry and definiteness or determinateness (to orismenon).  In the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' he adds another essential, namely, a certain magnitude; the object should not be too large, while clearness of perception requires that it should not be too small.

Aristotle was passionate about goodness in men as he valued "taking [its] virtues to be central to a well-lived life."&lt;ref name="Kraut"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kraut|first=Richard|title=Aristotle's Ethics|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/aristotle-ethics/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Politics'', he writes, "Again, men in general desire the good, and not merely what their fathers had."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aristotle|title=Politics|pages=Book II, 1269.a4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To thoroughly comprehend goodness, Aristotle also studied [[Beauty]]. As noted in the Encyclopædia Britannica (1902), moreover, Aristotle, "ignores all conceptions of an absolute Beauty, and at the same time seeks to distinguish the Beautiful from the Good." Aristotle explains that men "will be better able to achieve [their] good if [they] develop a fuller understanding of what it is to flourish."&lt;ref name="Kraut"/&gt; He nonetheless seeks (in the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'') to distinguish the good and the beautiful by saying that the former is always in action (`en praxei) whereas the latter may exist in motionless things as well (`en akinetois.)  At the same time he allowed that the good might under certain conditions be called beautiful. He further distinguished the beautiful from the fit, and in a passage of the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' set beauty above the useful and necessary.

Aristotle's views on [[fine art]] distinctly recognized (in the ''Politics'' and elsewhere) that the aim of art is immediate pleasure, as distinct from utility, which is the end of the mechanical arts.  He took a higher view of artistic imitation than Plato, holding that it implied knowledge and discovery, that its objects not only comprised particular things which happen to exist, but contemplated what is probable and what necessarily exists. In the ''Poetics'' he declares poetry to be more philosophical and serious a matter (spoudaiteron) than History.  He gives us no complete classification of the fine arts, and it is doubtful how far his principles, e.g. his idea of a purification of the passions by tragedy, are to be taken as applicable to other than the poetic art.

===Plotinus===
Of the later Greek and Roman writers the Neo-Platonist [[Plotinus]] deserves to be mentioned.  According to him, objective reason (nous) as self-moving, becomes the formative influence which reduces dead matter to form.  Matter when thus formed becomes a notion (logos), and its form is beauty.  Objects are ugly so far as they are unacted upon by reason, and therefore formless.  The creative reason is absolute beauty, and is called the more than beautiful.  There are three degrees or stages of manifested beauty: that of human reason, which is the highest; of the human soul, which is less perfect through its connexion with a material body; and of real objects, which is the lowest manifestation of all.  As to the precise forms of beauty, he supposed, in opposition to Aristotle, that a single thing not divisible into parts might be beautiful through its unity and simplicity.  He gives a high place to the beauty of colours in which material darkness is overpowered by light and warmth.  In reference to artistic beauty he said that when the artist has notions as models for his creations, these may become more beautiful than natural objects.  This is clearly a step away from Plato's doctrine towards our modern conception of artistic idealization.

==Western medieval aesthetics==
[[File:Codexaureus 25.jpg|thumb|[[Lorsch Gospels]] 778–820. [[Charlemagne|Charlemagne's]] Court School.]]

Surviving [[medieval art]] is primarily religious in focus and funded largely by the [[State (polity)|State]], [[Roman Catholic]] or [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] church, powerful ecclesiastical individuals, or wealthy secular patrons. These art pieces often served a liturgical function, whether as [[Chalice (cup)|chalices]] or even as [[church (building)|church buildings]] themselves. Objects of fine art from this period were frequently made from rare and valuable materials, such as gold and [[Lapis lazuli|lapis]], the cost of which commonly exceeded the wages of the artist.

Medieval aesthetics in the realm of philosophy built upon Classical thought, continuing the practice of [[Plotinus]] by employing theological terminology in its explications. St. [[Bonaventure]]'s "Retracing the Arts to Theology", a primary example of this method, discusses the skills of the artisan as gifts given by God for the purpose of disclosing God to mankind, which purpose is achieved through four lights: the light of skill in mechanical arts which discloses the world of artifacts; which light is guided by the light of [[sense perception]] which discloses the world of natural forms; which light, consequently, is guided by the light of philosophy which discloses the world of intellectual truth; finally, this light is guided by the light of divine wisdom which discloses the world of saving truth.

Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s aesthetic is probably the most famous and influential theory among medieval authors, having been the subject of much scrutiny in the wake of the neo-Scholastic revival of the late 19th and early 20th centuries and even having received the approbation of the celebrated Modernist writer, [[James Joyce]]. Thomas, like many other medievals, never gives a systematic account of beauty itself, but several scholars have conventionally arranged his thought—though not always with uniform conclusions—using relevant observations spanning the entire corpus of his work. While Aquinas's theory follows generally the model of [[Aristotle]], he develops a singular aesthetics which incorporates elements unique to his thought. [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''The Aesthetics of Thomas Aquinas'' identifies the three main characteristics of beauty in Aquinas's philosophy: ''integritas sive perfectio'', ''consonantia sive debita proportio'', and ''claritas sive splendor formae''. While Aristotle likewise identifies the first two characteristics, St. Thomas conceives of the third as an appropriation from principles developed by neo-Platonic and Augustinian thinkers. With the shift from the Middle Ages to the [[Renaissance]], art likewise changed its focus, as much in its content as in its mode of expression.

==Age of Enlightenment==

===Addison===
[[Joseph Addison|Addison]]'s "Essays on the Imagination" contributed to the ''Spectator'', though they belong to popular literature, contain the germ of scientific analysis in the statement that the pleasures of imagination (which arise originally from sight) fall into two classes — (1) primary pleasures, which entirely proceed from objects before our eyes; and (2) secondary pleasures, flowing from the ideas of visible objects.  The latter are greatly extended by the addition of the proper enjoyment of resemblance, which is at the basis of all mimicry and wit.  Addison recognizes, too, to some extent, the influence of association upon our aesthetic preferences.

===Shaftesbury===
[[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] is the first of the intuitional writers on beauty.  In his ''Characteristics'' the beautiful and the good are combined in one ideal conception, much as with [[Plato]].  Matter in itself is ugly.  The order of the world, wherein all beauty really resides, is a spiritual principle, all motion and life being the product of spirit.  The principle of beauty is perceived not with the outer sense, but with an internal or moral sense which apprehends the good as well.  This perception yields the only true delight, namely, spiritual enjoyment.

===Hutcheson===
[[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], in his ''System of Moral Philosophy'', though he adopts many of Shaftesbury's ideas, distinctly disclaims any independent self-existing beauty in objects. "All beauty", he says, "is relative to the sense of some mind perceiving it."  One cause of beauty is to be found not in a simple sensation such as colour or tone, but in a certain order among the parts, or "uniformity amidst variety". The faculty by which this principle is discerned is an internal sense which is defined as "a passive power of receiving ideas of beauty from all objects in which there is uniformity in variety". This inner sense resembles the external senses in the immediateness of the pleasure which its activity brings, and further in the necessity of its impressions: a beautiful thing being always, whether we will or no, beautiful.  He distinguishes two kinds of beauty, absolute or original, and relative or comparative.  The latter is discerned in an object which is regarded as an imitation or semblance of another.  He distinctly states that "an exact imitation may still be beautiful though the original were entirely devoid of it." He seeks to prove the universality of this sense of beauty, by showing that all men, in proportion to the enlargement of their intellectual capacity, are more delighted with uniformity than the opposite.

===Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten===

Perhaps the first German philosopher who developed an independent aesthetic theory was [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]]. In his best-known work ''Aesthetica'', he complemented the [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]-[[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolffian]] theory of knowledge by adding to the clear scientific or "logical" knowledge of the understanding the knowledge of the senses, to which he gave the name "aesthetic". It is for this reason that Baumgarten is said to have "coined" the term ''aesthetics''. Beauty to him corresponds to perfect sense-knowledge. Baumgarten reduces taste to an intellectual act and ignores the element of feeling.  To him, nature is the highest embodiment of beauty, and thus art must seek its supreme function in the strictest possible imitation of nature.

===Burke===
[[Edmund Burke|Burke]]'s speculations, in his ''Inquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful'', illustrate the tendency of English writers to treat the problem as a psychological one and to introduce physiological considerations.  He finds the elements of beauty to be:-- (1) smallness; (2) smoothness; (3) gradual variation of direction in gentle curves; (4) delicacy, or the appearance of fragility; (5) brightness, purity and softness of colour.  The sublime is rather crudely resolved into astonishment, which he thinks always retains an element of terror.  Thus "infinity has a tendency to fill the mind with a delightful horror." Burke seeks what he calls "efficient causes" for these aesthetic impressions in certain affections of the nerves of sight analogous to those of other senses, namely, the soothing effect of a relaxation of the nerve fibres.  The arbitrariness and narrowness of this theory cannot well escape the reader's attention.

===Kant===
[[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] theory of aesthetic judgments remains a highly debated aesthetic theory until today. It is important to note that Kant uses the term "aesthetics" ("Ästhetik") to refer to any sensual experience.&lt;ref name=Eisler-Aesthetik&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eisler|first1=Rudolf|title=Ästhetik|url=http://www.textlog.de/32225.html|website=Kant-Lexikon|publisher=Rudolf Eisler|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work most crucial to aesthetics as a strand of philosophy is the first half of his [[Critique of Judgment|Critique of the Power of Judgment]], the ''Critique of the Aesthetic Power of Judgment''. It is subdivided in two main parts - the ''Analytic of the Beautiful'' and the ''Analytic of the Sublime'', but also deals with the experience of fine art.

For Kant, '''beauty''' does not reside ''inside'' an object, but is defined as the pleasure that stems from the ″free play″ of imagination and understanding inspired by the object — which as a result we will call beautiful. Such pleasure is more than mere agreeableness, since it must be disinterested and free — that is to say independent from the object's ability to serve as an end to a mean. Even though the feeling of beauty is subjective, Kant goes beyond the notion of ″beauty is in the eye of the beholder″: If something is beautiful to me, I also think that it should be so for everybody else, even though I cannot prove beauty to anyone. Kant also insists that the aesthetic judgment is always, an "individual" i.e. a singular one, of the form "''This'' object (e.g. rose) is beautiful."  He denies that we can reach a valid universal aesthetic judgment of the form "All objects possessing such and such qualities are beautiful." (A judgment of this form would be logical, not aesthetic.) Nature, in Kant's aesthetics, is the primary example for beauty, ranking as a source of aesthetic pleasure above art, which he only considers in the last parts of the third ''Critique of the Aesthetic Judgment''. It is in these last paragraphs where he connects to his earlier works when he argues that the highest significance of beauty is to symbolize moral good; going in this regard even further than [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]].

==German writers==

===Schelling===
[[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Schelling]] is the first thinker to attempt a Philosophy of Art.  He develops this as the third part of his system of transcendental idealism following theoretic and practical philosophy.  (See also Schelling's ''Werke'', Bd. v., and J. Watson, Schelling's ''Transcendental Idealism'', ch. vii., Chicago, 1882.)  According to Schelling a new philosophical significance is given to art by the doctrine that the identity of subject and object — which is half disguised in ordinary perception and volition — is only clearly seen in artistic perception.  The perfect perception of its [[real self]] by intelligence in the work of art is accompanied by a feeling of infinite satisfaction.  Art in thus effecting a revelation of the absolute seems to attain a dignity not merely above that of nature but above that of philosophy itself.  Schelling throws but little light on the concrete forms of beauty.  His classification of the arts, based on his antithesis of object and subject, is a curiosity in intricate arrangement.  He applies his conception in a suggestive way to classical tragedy.

===Hegel===
In [[Hegel]]'s system of philosophy art is viewed as the first stage of the absolute spirit.  (See also ''Werke'', Bd. x., and Bosanquet's ''Introduction to Hegel's Philosophy of Fine Art''.)  In this stage the absolute is immediately present to sense-perception, an idea which shows the writer's complete rupture with Kant's doctrine of the "subjectivity" of beauty. The beautiful is defined as the ideal showing itself to sense or through a sensuous medium.  It is said to have its life in show or semblance (Schein) and so differs from the true, which is not really sensuous, but the universal idea contained in sense for thought.  The form of the beautiful is unity of the manifold.  The notion (Begriff) gives necessity in mutual dependence of parts (unity), while the reality demands the semblance (Schein) of liberty in the parts.  He discusses very fully the beauty of nature as immediate unity of notion and reality, and lays great emphasis on the beauty of organic life.  But it is in art that, like Schelling, Hegel finds the highest revelation of the beautiful.  Art makes up for the deficiencies of natural beauty by bringing the idea into clearer light, by showing the external world in its life and spiritual animation.  The several species of art in the ancient and modern worlds depend on the various combinations of matter and form.  He classifies the individual arts according to this same principle of the relative supremacy of form and matter, the lowest being architecture, the highest, poetry.

===Dialectic of the Hegelians===
Curious developments of the Hegelian conception are to be found in the [[dialectic]]al treatment of beauty in its relation to the ugly, the sublime, etc., by Hegel's disciples, e.g. [[Christian Hermann Weisse|C. H. Weisse]] and [[Johann Karl Friedrich Rosenkranz|J. K. F. Rosenkranz]].  The most important product of the Hegelian School is the elaborate system of aesthetics published by [[Friedrich Theodor Vischer|F. T. Vischer]] (''Esthetik'', 3 Theile, 1846—1834).  It illustrates the difficulties of the Hegelian thought and terminology; yet in dealing with art it is full of knowledge and highly suggestive.

===Schopenhauer===
The aesthetic problem is also treated by two other philosophers whose thought set out from certain tendencies in Kant's system, namely [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]].  Schopenhauer (see also ''The World as Will and Idea'', translated by R. B. Haldane, esp. vol. i. pp.&amp;nbsp;219–346), abandoning also Kant's doctrine of the subjectivity of beauty, found in aesthetic contemplation the perfect emancipation of intellect from will.  In this contemplation the mind is filled with pure intellectual forms, the "Platonic Ideas" as he calls them, which are objectifications of the will at a certain grade of completeness of representation.  He exalts the state of artistic contemplation as the one in which, as pure intellect set free from will, the misery of existence is surmounted and something of blissful ecstasy attained.  He holds that all things are in some degree beautiful, ugliness being viewed as merely imperfect manifestation or objectification of will.  In this way the beauty of nature, somewhat slighted by Schelling and Hegel, is rehabilitated.

===Herbart===
[[Johann Friedrich Herbart|J. F. Herbart]] struck out another way of escaping from Kant's idea of a purely subjective beauty (Kerbach's edition of ''Werke'', Bd. ii. pp.&amp;nbsp;339 et seq.; Bd. iv. pp.&amp;nbsp;105 et seq., and Bd. ix. pp.&amp;nbsp;92 et seq..)  He did, indeed, adopt Kant's view of the aesthetic Judgment as singular ("individual"); though he secures a certain degree of logical universality for it by emphasizing the point that the predicate (beauty) is permanently true of the same aesthetic object.  At the same time, by referring the beauty of concrete objects to certain aesthetic relations, he virtually accepted the possibility of universal aesthetic judgments (compare above).  Since he thus reduces beauty to abstract relations he is known as a [[formalism (philosophy)|formalist]], and the founder of the formalistic school in aesthetics.  He sets out with the idea that only relations please — in the Kantian sense of producing pleasure devoid of desire; and his aim is to determine the "aesthetic elementary relations", or the simplest relations which produce this pleasure.  These include those of will, so that, as he admits, ethical judgments are in a manner brought under an aesthetic form.  His typical example of aesthetic relations of objects of sense-perception is that of harmony between tones.  The science of [[figured bass|thorough-bass]] has, he thinks, done for music what should be done also for other departments of aesthetic experience.  This doctrine of elementary relations is brought into connexion with the author's psychological doctrine of presentations with their tendencies to mutual inhibition and to fusion, and of the varying feeling-tones to which these processes give rise.  This mode of treating the problem of beauty and aesthetic perception has been greatly developed and worked up into a comrlete system of aesthetics by one of Herbart's disciples, Robert Zimmermann (''Asthetik'', 1838).

===Lessing===
[[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], in his ''Laocoon'' and elsewhere, sought to deduce the special function of an art from a consideration of the means at its disposal.  He took pains to define the boundaries of poetry and upon the ends and appliances of art.  Among these his distinction between arts which employ the coexistent in space and those which employ the successive (as poetry and music) is of lasting value.  In his dramatic criticisms he similarly endeavoured to develop clear general principles on such points as poetic truth, improving upon Aristotle, on whose teaching he mainly relies.

===Goethe and Schiller===
[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] wrote several tracts on aesthetic topics, as well as many aphorisms.  He attempted to mediate between the claims of ideal beauty, as taught by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|J. J. Winckelmann]], and the aims of dualization.  [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] discusses, in a number of disconnected essays and letters some of the main questions in the philosophy of art.  He looks at art from the side of culture and the forces of human nature, and finds in an aesthetically cultivated soul the reconciliation of the sensual and rational.  His letters on aesthetic education (''Uber die asthetische Erziehung des Menschen'', trans. by J. Weiss, Boston, 1845) are valuable, bringing out among other points the connexion between aesthetic activity and the universal impulse to play (Spieltrieb).  Schiller's thoughts on aesthetic subjects are pervaded with the spirit of Kant's philosophy.

===Jean Paul Richter===
Another example of this kind of reflective discussion of art by literary men is afforded us in the Vorschule der Asthetik of [[Jean Paul|Jean Paul Richter]].  This is a rather ambitious discussion of the sublime and ludicrous, which, however, contains much valuable matter on the nature of humour in romantic poetry.  Among other writers who reflect more or less philosophically on the problems to which modern poetry gives rise are [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], the two Schlegels ([[August Wilhelm Schlegel|August]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich]]) and [[Georg Gottfried Gervinus|Gervinus]].

===Contributions by German savants===
A word may be said in conclusion on the attempts of German savants to apply a knowledge of physiological conditions to the investigation of the sensuous elements of aesthetic effect, as well as to introduce into the study of the simpler aesthetic forms the methods of natural science.  The classic work of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] on "Sensations of Tone" is a highly musical composition on physics and physiology.  The endeavour to determine with a like degree of precision the physiological conditions of the pleasurable effects of colours and their combinations by [[Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke|E. W. Brucke]], [[Ewald Hering]] and more recent investigators, has so far failed to realize the desideratum laid down by Herbart, that there should be a theory of colour-relations equal in completeness and exactness to that of tone-relations.  The experimental inquiry into simple aesthetically pleasing forms was begun by [[Gustav Fechner|G. T. Fechner]] in seeking to test the soundness of Adolf Zeising's hypothesis that the most pleasing proportion in dividing a line, say the vertical part of a cross, is the "golden section", where the smaller division is to the larger as the latter to the sum. He describes in his work on "Experimental Aesthetics" (''Auf experimentalen Asthetik'') a series of experiments carried out on a large number of persons, bearing on this point, the results of which he considers to be in favour of Zeising's hypothesis.

==French writers==
In [[France]] aesthetic speculation grew out of the discussion by poets and critics on the relation of modern art; and [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]] in the 17th century, the development of the dispute between the "ancients" and the "moderns" at the end of the 17th century by [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|B. le Bouvier de Fontenelle]] and [[Charles Perrault]], and the continuation of the discussion as to the aims of poetry and of art generally in the 18th century by [[Voltaire]], [[Pierre Bayle|Bayle]], [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and others, not only offer to the modern theorists valuable material in the shape of a record by experts of their aesthetic experience, but disclose glimpses of important aesthetic principles. [[Yves Marie André]]'s ''Essay on Beauty'' was an exploration of visual, musical, moral, and intellectual beauty. A more systematic examination of the several arts (corresponding to that of [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]) is to be found in the ''Cours de belles lettres'' of [[Charles Batteux]] (1765), in which the meaning and value of the imitation of nature by art are further elucidated, and the arts are classified (as by Lessing) according as they employ the forms of space or those of time.

===Theories of organic beauty: Buffier===
The beginning of a more scientific investigation of beauty in general is connected with the name of [[Claude Buffier|Pere Buffier]] (see ''First Truths''), form, and illustrates his theory by the human face.  A beautiful face is at once the most common and most rare among members of the species.  This seems to be a clumsy way of saying that it is a clear expression of the typical form of the species.

===Hippolyte Taine===
This idea of typical beauty (which was adopted by [[Joshua Reynolds|Reynolds]]) has been worked out more recently by [[Hippolyte Taine]].  In his work, ''The Ideal in Art'' (trans. by I. Durand), he proceeds in the manner of a botanist to determine a scale of characters in the physical and moral man.  The degree of the universality or importance of a character, and of its beneficence or adaptation to the ends of life, determine the measure of its aesthetic value, and render the work of art, which seeks to represent it in its purity, an ideal work.

===French systems of aesthetics: The ''spiritualistes''===
The only elaborated systems of aesthetics in French literature are those constructed by the ''spiritualistes'', the philosophic writers who under the influence of German thinkers effected a reaction against the crude sensationalism of the 18th century.  They aim at elucidating the higher and spiritual element in aesthetic impressions, appearing to ignore any capability in the sensuous material of affording a true aesthetic delight.  [[Victor Cousin]] and Jean Charles Leveque are the principal writers of this school.  The latter developed an elaborate system of the subject (''La Science du beau'').  All beauty is regarded as spiritual in its nature.  The several beautiful characters of an organic body — of which the principal are magnitude, unity and variety of parts, intensity of colour, grace or flexibility, and correspondence to environment — may be brought under the conception of the ideal grandeur and order of the species.  These are perceived by reason to be the manifestations of an invisible vital force.  Similarly the beauties of inorganic nature are to be viewed as the grand and orderly displays of an immaterial physical force.  Thus all beauty is in its objective essence either spirit or unconscious force acting with fulness and in order.

==British writers==
There is nothing answering to the German conception of a system of aesthetics in English literature.  The inquiries of English thinkers have been directed for the most part to such modest problems as the psychological process by which we perceive the beautiful — discussions which are apt to be regarded by German historians as devoid of real philosophical value.  The writers may be conveniently arranged in two divisions, answering to the two opposed directions of English thought: (1) the Intuitionalists, those who recognize the existence of an objective beauty which is a simple unanalysable attribute or principle of things; and (2) the Analytical theorists, those who follow the analytical and psychological method, concerning themselves with the sentiment of beauty as a complex growth out of simpler elements.

===The Intuitionists===

====Reid====
In his ''Essays on the Intellectual Powers'' (viii. "Of Taste") [[Thomas Reid]] applies his principle of common sense to the problem of beauty saying that objects of beauty agree not only in producing a certain agreeable emotion, but in the excitation along with this emotion of a belief that they possess some perfection or excellence, that beauty exists in the objects independently of our minds.  His theory of beauty is severely spiritual.  All beauty resides primarily in the faculties of the mind, intellectual and moral.  The beauty which is spread over the face of visible nature is an emanation from this spiritual beauty, and is beauty because it symbolizes and expresses the latter.  Thus the beauty of a plant resides in its perfect adaptation to its end, a perfection which is an expression of the wisdom of its Creator.

====Hamilton====
In his ''Lectures on Metaphysics'' [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir W. Hamilton]] gives a short account of the sentiments of taste, which (with a superficial resemblance to Kant) he regards as subserving both the subsidiary and the elaborative faculties in cognition, that is, the imagination and the understanding.  The activity of the former corresponds to the element of variety in a beautiful object, that of the latter with its unity.  He explicitly excludes all other kinds of pleasure, such as the sensuous, from the proper gratification of beauty.  He denies that the attribute of beauty belongs to fitness.

====Ruskin====
[[John Ruskin]]'s well-known speculations on the nature of beauty in ''Modern Painters'' ("Of ideas of beauty"), though sadly wanting in scientific precision, have a certain value in the history of divine attributes.  Its true nature is appreciated by the theoretic faculty which is concerned in the moral conception and appreciation of ideas of beauty, and must be distinguished from the imaginative or artistic faculty, which is employed in regarding in a certain way and combining the ideas received from external nature.  He distinguishes between typical and vital beauty.  The former is the external quality of bodies which typifies some divine attribute.  The latter consists in "the appearance of felicitous fulfilment of function in living things". The forms of typical beauty are:-- (1) infinity, the type of the divine incomprehensibility; (2) unity, the type of the divine comprehensiveness; (3) repose, the type of the divine permanence; (4) symmetry, the type of the divine justice; (5) purity, the type of the divine energy; and (6) moderation, the type of government by law.  Vital beauty, again, is regarded as relative when the degree of exaltation of the function is estimated, or generic if only the degree of conformity of an individual to the appointed functions of the species is taken into account.  Ruskin's writings illustrate the extreme tendency to identify aesthetic with moral perception.

===The analytical theorists===

====Home====
In the ''Elements of Criticism'' of [[Henry Home, Lord Kames|Home (Lord Kames)]] another attempt is made to resolve the pleasure of beauty into its elements.  Beauty and ugliness are simply the pleasant and he appears to admit no general characteristic of beautiful objects beyond this power of yielding pleasure.  Like Hutcheson, he divides beauty into intrinsic and relative, but understands by the latter the appearance of fitness and utility, which is excluded from the beautiful by Hutcheson.

====Hogarth====
Passing by the name of Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]], whose theory of beauty closely resembles that of [[Claude Buffier|Pere Buffier]], we come to the articulations of another artist and painter, [[William Hogarth]].  He discusses, in his ''Analysis of Beauty'', all the elements of visual beauty.  He finds in this the following elements:-- (1) fitness of the parts to some design; (2) variety in as many ways as possible; (3) uniformity, regularity or symmetry, which is only beautiful when it helps to preserve the character of fitness; (4) simplicity or distinctness, which gives pleasure not in itself, but through its enabling the eye to enjoy variety with ease; (5) intricacy, which provides employment for our active energies, leading the eye "a wanton kind of chase"; (6) quantity or magnitude, which draws our attention and produces admiration and awe.  The beauty of proportion he resolves into the needs of fitness.  Hogarth applies these principles to the determination of the degrees of beauty in lines, figures and groups of forms.  Among lines he singles out for special honour the serpentine (formed by drawing a line once round from the base to the apex of a long slender cone).

====Alison====
[[Archibald Alison (Scottish author)|Alison]], in his well-known ''Essays on the Nature and Principles of Taste'', proceeds by a method exactly the opposite to that of Hogarth and Burke.  He seeks to analyse the mental process then finds that this consists in a peculiar operation of the imagination, namely, the flow of a train of ideas through the mind, which ideas always correspond to some simple affection or emotion (e.g. cheerfulness, sadness, awe) awakened by the object.  He thus makes association the sole source of aesthetic delight, and denies the existence of a primary source in sensations themselves.  He illustrates the working of the principle of association at great length, and with much skill; yet his attempt to make it the unique source of aesthetic pleasure fails completely.  [[Francis Jeffrey]]'s ''Essays on Beauty'' (in the Edinburgh Review, and Encyclopædia Britannica, 8th edition) are little more than a modification of Alison's theory.  ''Philosophical Essays'' consists in pointing out the unwarranted assumption lurking in the doctrine of a single quality running through all varieties of beautiful object.  He seeks to show how the successive changes in the meaning of the term "beautiful" have arisen.  He suggests that it originally connoted the pleasure of colour.  The value of his discussion resides more in the criticism of his predecessors than in the contribution of new ideas.  His conception of the sublime, suggested by the etymology of the word, emphasizes the element of height in objects.

Of the association psychologists [[James Mill]] did little more towards the analysis of the sentiments of beauty than re-state Alison's doctrine.  [[Alexander Bain]], in his treatise, ''The Emotions and the Will'' ("Aesthetic Emotions"), carries this examination considerably further.  He seeks to differentiate aesthetic from other varieties of pleasurable emotion by three characteristics:-- (1) their freedom from life-serving uses, being gratifications sought for their own sakes; (2) their purity from all disagreeable concomitants; (3) their eminently sympathetic or shareable nature.  He takes a comprehensive view of the constituents of aesthetic enjoyment, including the pleasures of sensation and of its revived or its "ideal" form; of revived emotional states; and lastly the satisfaction of those wide-ranging susceptibilities which we call the love of novelty, of contrast and of harmony.  The effect of sublimity is connected with the manifestation of superior power in its highest degrees, which manifestation excites a sympathetic elation in the beholder.  The ludicrous, again, is defined by Bain, improving on Aristotle and Hobbes, as the degradation of something possessing dignity in circumstances that excite no other strong emotion.

====Spencer====
[[Herbert Spencer]], in his ''First Principles'', ''Principles of Psychology'' and ''Essays'', has given an interesting turn to the psychology of aesthetics by the application of his doctrine of evolution.  Adopting [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s idea of a connexion between aesthetic activity and play, he seeks to make it the starting-point in tracing the evolution of aesthetic activity.  Play is defined as the outcome of the superfluous energies of the organism: as the activity of organs and faculties which, owing to a prolonged period of inactivity, have become specially ready to discharge their function, and as a consequence vent themselves in simulated actions.  Aesthetic activities supply a similar mode of self-relieving discharge to the higher organs of perception and emotion; and they further agree with play in not directly subserving any processes conducive to life; in being gratifications sought for their own sake only.  Spencer seeks to construct a hierarchy of aesthetic pleasures according to the degree of complexity of the faculty exercised: from those of sensation up to the revived emotional experiences which constitute the aesthetic sentiment proper.  Among the more vaguely revived emotions Spencer includes more permanent feelings of the race transmitted by heredity; as when he refers the deep and indefinable emotion excited by music to associations with vocal tones expressive of feeling built up during the history of our species.  This biological treatment of aesthetic activity has had a wide influence, some e.g. [[Grant Allen]] being content to develop his evolutional method.  Yet, as suggested above, his theory is now recognized as taking us only a little way towards an adequate understanding of our aesthetic experience.


==Cultural history before the 20th century==
{{See also|Beauty (ancient thought)}}
[[File:Poseidon.jpg|thumb|[[Bronze sculpture]], thought to be either [[Poseidon]] or [[Zeus]], [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]]]

Any aesthetic doctrines that guided the production and interpretation of [[prehistoric art]] are mostly unknown. An indirect concern with aesthetics can be inferred from [[ancient art]] in many early civilizations, including [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Persia|Persia]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[China]], the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[History of India|India]], the [[Celtic art|Celtic peoples]], and the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], as each of them developed a unique and characteristic style in its art.

===Western aesthetics===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
Western aesthetics usually refers to [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers as the earliest source of formal aesthetic considerations. [[Plato]] believed in beauty as a ''form'' in which beautiful objects partake and which causes them to be beautiful. He felt that beautiful objects incorporated proportion, [[harmony]], and unity among their parts. Similarly, in the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', [[Aristotle]] found that the universal elements of beauty were order, [[symmetry]], and definiteness.

[[File:Violin and Candlestick.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cubist]] painting by [[Georges Braque]], ''Violin and Candlestick'' (1910)]]

From the late 17th to the early 20th century Western aesthetics underwent a slow revolution into what is often called [[modernism]]. German and British thinkers emphasized beauty as the key component of art and of the aesthetic experience, and saw art as necessarily aiming at absolute beauty.

For [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]] aesthetics is the science of the sense experiences, a younger sister of logic, and beauty is thus the most perfect kind of knowledge that sense experience can have. For [[Immanuel Kant]] the aesthetic experience of beauty is a judgment of a subjective but similar human truth, since all people should agree that "this [[rose]] is beautiful" if it in fact is. However, beauty cannot be reduced to any more basic set of features. For [[Friedrich Schiller]] aesthetic appreciation of beauty is the most perfect reconciliation of the sensual and rational parts of human nature.

For [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], the philosophy of art is the "organon" of philosophy concerning the relation between man and nature. So aesthetics began now to be the name for the ''philosophy of art''. [[Friedrich von Schlegel]], [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]], [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] also gave lectures on aesthetics as ''philosophy of art'' after 1800.

For Hegel, all culture is a matter of "absolute spirit" coming to be manifest to itself, stage by stage, changing to a [[perfection]] that only philosophy can approach. Art is the first stage in which the absolute spirit is manifest immediately to sense-perception, and is thus an objective rather than subjective revelation of beauty.

For [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] aesthetic contemplation of beauty is the most free that the pure intellect can be from the dictates of will; here we contemplate perfection of form without any kind of worldly agenda, and thus any intrusion of utility or politics would ruin the point of the beauty. It is thus for Schopenhauer one way to fight the [[suffering]].

The British were largely divided into intuitionist and analytic camps. The intuitionists believed that aesthetic experience was disclosed by a single mental faculty of some kind. For [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury]] this was identical to the moral sense, beauty just is the sensory version of moral goodness. For [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] aesthetics consisted in the description of a whole culture which is a linguistic impossibility. Hence his viewpoint can be paraphrased as "That which constitutes aesthetics lies outside the realm of the language game".

[[File:The Painter and His Pug by William Hogarth.jpg|thumb|[[William Hogarth]], self-portrait, 1745]]
For [[Oscar Wilde]], the contemplation of beauty for beauty's sake (augmented by [[John Ruskin]]'s search for moral grounding) was more than the foundation for much of his literary career; he once stated, "Aestheticism is a search after the signs of the beautiful. It is the science of the beautiful through which men seek the correlation of the arts. It is, to speak more exactly, the search after the secret of life.".&lt;ref&gt;"Oscar Wilde" by [[Richard Ellman]] p 122, pub Alfred A Knopf, INC. 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilde toured the United States in 1882 spreading the idea of Aesthetics in a speech called "The English Renaissance". In his speech he proposed that Beauty and Aesthetics were "not languid but energetic. By beautifying the outward aspects of life, one would beautify the inner ones." The English Renaissance was, he said, "like the Italian Renaissance before it, a sort of rebirth of the spirit of man".&lt;ref&gt;Ellman, p164&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] beauty is disclosed by an inner mental sense, but is a subjective fact rather than an objective one. Analytic theorists like [[Henry Home, Lord Kames]], [[William Hogarth]], and [[Edmund Burke]] hoped to reduce beauty to some list of attributes. Hogarth, for example, thinks that beauty consists of (1) fitness of the parts to some design; (2) variety in as many ways as possible; (3) uniformity, regularity or symmetry, which is only beautiful when it helps to preserve the character of fitness; (4) simplicity or distinctness, which gives pleasure not in itself, but through its enabling the eye to enjoy variety with ease; (5) intricacy, which provides employment for our active energies, leading the eye on "a wanton kind of chase"; and (6) quantity or magnitude, which draws our attention and produces admiration and awe. Later analytic aestheticians strove to link beauty to some scientific theory of [[psychology]] (such as [[James Mill]]) or [[biology]] (such as [[Herbert Spencer]]).

===Indian aesthetics===
{{main|Rasa (aesthetics)}}

The Indian aesthetics tradition traces to the [[Vedas|Vedic]] era texts of [[Hinduism]]. The Aitareya [[Brahmana]] (~1000 BCE) in section 6.27, for example, states the arts are a refinement of the self (''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atma]]-samskrti'').&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti2016p1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arindam Chakrabarti|title=The Bloomsbury Research Handbook of Indian Aesthetics and the Philosophy of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXFYCwAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-4725-2430-0|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest surviving complete Sanskrit manuscript that discusses a theory of aesthetics is of ''[[Natya Shastra]]'', estimated to have been complete between 200 BCE and 200 CE.{{sfn|Natalia Lidova|2014}} This theory is called ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]'' in the text. ''Rasa'' is an ancient concept in Indian arts about the aesthetic flavor of any visual, literary or musical work, that evokes an emotion or feeling in the reader or audience, but that cannot be described.&lt;ref name=britrasa&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/rasa Rasa: Indian Aesthetic Theory], Encyclopedia Britannica (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Natya shastra'', the goal of arts is to empower aesthetic experience, deliver emotional ''rasa'' (juice, taste). In many cases, art aims to produce repose and relief for those exhausted with labor, or distraught with grief, or laden with misery, or struck by austere times.&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti2016p1"/&gt; Yet entertainment is an effect, but not the primary goal of arts according to ''Natya shastra''. The primary goal is to create ''rasa'' so as to lift and transport the spectators, unto the expression of ultimate reality and transcendent values.&lt;ref name="Schwartz2004p12"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan L.

The most complete exposition of aesthetics in drama, songs and other performance arts is found in the works of the Kashmiri [[Shaivism|Shaivite]]-Hindu philosopher [[Abhinavagupta]] (c. 1000 CE).&lt;ref name=britrasa/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartz2004p12"/&gt;&lt;ref name=meyer102/&gt; Abhinavagupta's analysis of ''Natyasastra'' is notable for its extensive discussion of aesthetic and ontological questions.{{Sfn|Ananda Lal|2004|p=308, 492}}{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|pp=22-24}}

The concept of rasa is fundamental to many forms of [[Indian art]]s including [[Dance in India|dance]], [[Indian classical music|music]], theatre, painting, sculpture, and [[Indian literature|literature]], the interpretation and implementation of a particular rasa differs between different styles and schools.{{Sfn|Wallace Dace|1963|pp=249-252}}{{Sfn|Rowell|2015|pp=327-333}}&lt;ref name="Tymieniecka2012p295"&gt;{{cite book|author= W.S.

In the aesthetic theories of Indian poetics, its ancient scholars discuss both what is stated and how it is stated (words, grammar, rhythm), suggesting that the meaning of the text and the experience of ''rasa'' are both important.&lt;ref name="Tymieniecka2012p295"/&gt; Among the most celebrated in Hindu traditions on the theory of poetics and literary works, are 5th-century [[Bhartṛhari|Bhartrhari]] and the 9th-century Anandavardhana, but the theoretical tradition on integrating ''rasa'' into literary artworks likely goes back to a more ancient period.

===Chinese aesthetics===
[[Chinese art]] has a long history of varied styles and emphases. [[Confucius]] emphasized the role of the arts and humanities (especially music and poetry) in broadening human nature and aiding ''li'' (etiquette, the rites) in bringing us back to what is essential about humanity. His opponent [[Mozi]], however, argued that music and fine arts were classist and wasteful, benefiting the rich over the poor.

By the 4th century AD artists had started debating in writing over the proper goals of art as well. [[Gu Kaizhi]] has left three surviving books on the theory of painting. Several later artists or scholars both created art and wrote about the creation of it. Religious and philosophical influences on art were common (and diverse) but never universal.

Modern Chinese aesthetic theory took shape during the modernization of China from Empire to republic in early 20th century. Thus thinkers like Kant, Hegel, Marx and Heidegger have all been incorporated into contemporary Chinese aesthetic theory, through philosophers like Li Zehou.&lt;ref&gt;[[Li Zehou]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===African aesthetics===
[[African art]] is the cultural expression of a vast and rich continent.  It is the product of millennia of changes, migrations, international and intercontinental trade, diplomacy and cultural norms.  Within the scholarship surrounding African art, there is some question in using the word "art" to describe it. Malidoma and Sonbofu Somé,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Somé|first1=Malidoma|title=The Healing Wisdom of Africa|date=1999|publisher=TarcherPerigee|isbn=087477991X|pages=352 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Somé|first1=Sonbofu|title=The Spirit of Intimacy|date=2000|publisher=William Morrow Publications|isbn=0688175791|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; cultural emissaries of the Dagara of Burkina Faso hold that within their culture the closest word for art is simply the word "sacred".  Kongo [[nkisi]] power objects illustrate this point.  They are objects traded on the contemporary art market on aesthetic value, however their purpose was to serve in rituals of personal and community healing.  Consideration is due, when viewing African cultural product, in understanding the primary function of these objects held within the cultures themselves.

There is a wonderful interplay between practicality and aesthetic in African material culture.  Consider the [[Akan people|Akan]] stool, [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] adire cloth and combs, or [[Gio people|Gio]] spoons.  Here you have an example of the African genius in enlivening the most mundane object into an aesthetic presence.  Sculpture and [[performance art]] are prominent, and abstract and partially abstracted forms are valued, and were valued long before influence from the Western tradition began in earnest. The [[Nok culture]] is testimony to this. The mosque of [[Timbuktu]] shows that specific areas of Africa developed unique aesthetics.

===Arab aesthetics===
[[File:Great Mosque of Djenné 3.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Mosque of Djenné|Great Mosque]]'s signature trio of [[minaret]]s overlooks the central market of [[Djenné]]. Unique Malian aesthetic]]
Arab art has the context of [[Islam]], started in the 7th century, is sometimes referred to as [[Islamic art]], although many Arab artists throughout time have not been Muslim. The term "Islamic" refers not only to the religion, but to any form of art created by people in an [[Muslim culture|Islamic culture]] or in an Islamic context, whether the artist is Islamic or not. Not all Muslims are in agreement on the use of art in religious observance, the proper place of art in society, or the relation between secular art and the demands placed on the secular world to conform to religious precepts. Islamic art frequently adopts secular elements and elements that are frowned upon, if not forbidden, by some [[Kalam|Islamic theologians]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Penelope J.E. Denny, Walter B. Hofrichter, Frima Fox. Jacobs, Joseph. Roberts, Ann M. Simon, David L. Janson's History of Art, Prentice Hall; 2007, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. Seventh Edition, {{ISBN|0-13-193455-4}} pg. 277&lt;/ref&gt; Although the often cited opposition in Islam to the depiction of human and animal forms holds true for religious art and architecture, in the secular sphere, such representations have flourished in nearly all Islamic cultures.

The Islamic resistance to the representation of living beings ultimately stems from the belief that the creation of living forms is unique to God, and it is for this reason that the role of images and image makers has been controversial. The strongest statements on the subject of figural depiction are made in the Hadith (Traditions of the Prophet), where painters are challenged to "breathe life" into their creations and threatened with punishment on the [[Day of Judgment]]. The Qur'an is less specific but condemns idolatry and uses the Arabic term musawwir ("maker of forms," or artist) as an epithet for God. Partially as a result of this religious sentiment, figures in painting were often stylized and, in some cases, the destruction of figurative artworks occurred. Iconoclasm was previously known in the Byzantine period and aniconicism was a feature of the Judaic world, thus placing the Islamic objection to figurative representations within a larger context. As ornament, however, figures were largely devoid of any larger significance and perhaps therefore posed less challenge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/figs/hd_figs.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Human portrayals can be found in early Islamic cultures with varying degrees of acceptance by religious authorities. Human representation for the purpose of worship is uniformly considered [[idolatry]] as forbidden in ''[[Sharia]]'' law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rpUuqLPPKK4C&amp;dq=wijdan&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QXySmKzsy6&amp;sig=a9V6tTTfsrTT5Ex01QGnwrL7XYY ''The Arab Contribution to Islamic Art: From the Seventh to the Fifteenth Centuries''], [Wijdan Ali], American Univ in Cairo Press, 10 December 1999, {{ISBN|977-424-476-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.let.uu.nl/solis/anpt/EJOS/pdf4/07Ali.pdf ''From the Literal to the Spiritual: The Development of the Prophet Muhammad's Portrayal from 13th century Ilkhanid Miniatures to 17th century Ottoman Art''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201123841/http://www2.let.uu.nl/Solis/anpt/ejos/pdf4/07Ali.pdf |date=2007-12-01 }}, [Steve Mwai], [http://www2.let.uu.nl/Solis/anpt/ejos/EJOS-1.html EJOS (Electronic Journal of Oriental Studies)], volume IV, issue 7, p.&amp;nbsp;1–24, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic is written from right to left, like other [[Semitic scripts]], and consists of 17 characters, which, with the addition of dots placed above or below certain of them, provide the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet. Short vowels are not included in the alphabet, being indicated by signs placed above or below the consonant or long vowel that they follow. Certain characters may be joined to their neighbours, others to the preceding one only, and others to the succeeding one only. The written letters undergo a slight external change according to their position within a word. When they stand alone or occur at the end of a word, they ordinarily terminate in a bold stroke; when they appear in the middle of a word, they are ordinarily joined to the letter following by a small, upward curved stroke. With the exception of six letters, which can be joined only to the preceding ones, the initial and medial letters are much abbreviated, while the final form consists of the initial form with a triumphant flourish. The essential part of the characters, however, remains unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calligraphyislamic.com/IntroIslamicCalligraphy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interactive children's books''' are a subset of [[children's books]] that require participation and interaction by the reader. Participation can range from books with texture to those with special devices used to help teach children certain tools. Interactive children's books may also incorporate modern technology or be computerized books. Movable books, a subsection of interactive books, are defined as "covering [[Pop-up book|pop-ups]], transformations, tunnel books, volvelles, flaps, pull-tabs, pop-outs, pull-downs, and more, each of which performs in a different manner. Also included, because they employ the same techniques, are three-dimensional greeting cards."{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Volvelles==
The earliest form of interactive books are thought to be [[volvelle]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/popup/theme.html]&lt;/ref&gt; a type of movable book with a wheel, which at the time was used to help display astrological and geographical maps.

== Pop-up books ==
It wasn't until the late nineteenth century, partly due to the invention of industrial printing, that [[Pop-up book|pop-ups]] were created. The first pop-up books published in America were those in the Showman Series published by the McLoughlin Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/popup/showman.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Still, these books were too expensive and fragile to be practical children's books. Pop-ups opened the door for the creation of many other types of interactive books for both children and adults. Despite a brief decline in production during the mid-twentieth century, it was a new idea that spawned quickly and eventually became the highly technological and advanced world of books that it is today.

== Coloring books ==
The [[coloring book]] format, of line drawings to which the child adds color, has been in production since the early 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== Gamebooks ==
[[Gamebook]]s are much like traditional books, but they offer the reader decisions throughout the book, with the decisions affecting the outcome of the story.  At each decision point, the reader is instructed to go to a particular page and/or paragraph to continue the story.  The first gamebook debuted in 1941.  The format was especially popular in the 1980s.

== Hidden object and picture books ==

Hidden object picture books engage readers of all ages by camouflaging items with the intention of children eventually finding them.  Whether the hidden object is a hard to spot character or an item specified by the author in a rhyming list, is subject to the book or possibly the series of books it belongs to.  Although it is not standard, these types of interactive children’s books are sometimes published with a common theme such as Christmas or life on the farm.  Children can interactively experience a selective number of these books as early as age four and beginning at a pre-kindergarten grade level, depending on how easily the hidden objectives can be located.  There are several notable authors and illustrators at the frontline assisting their audiences’ development of interactive reading skills in hidden object picture books:

===Martin Handford Where’s Wally?===
British illustrator [[Martin Handford]] is credited with the conception of the [[Where's Wally?]] series.  Despite the series christened title, his hidden picture books are more recognizable under the North American franchise’s version of the character, Waldo.  The purpose of Handford’s hidden object picture books is for children of all ages to identify Wally in a specified location throughout his “world-wide hike.” Although various activities and outfit similarities easily camouflage the character’s whereabouts, Wally always wears glasses and carries a walking stick and is famous for his outfit of a red and white horizontally striped shirt, blue trousers and a bobble hat.

The first book in Handford’s series, originally titled ''Where's Wally?'', was published in 1987. The book was soon followed by the release of [[Where's Wally Now?]] (1988) and [[Where's Wally?: The Fantastic Journey]] (1989). The books became extremely popular and were translated into many languages.  The trademark of Wally was adopted in 28 countries and the character is often given a different name and personality in the translations.

As more books were released the cast of characters grew as well - including Wizard Whitebeard, Wilma, Wenda, [[Woof (Where's Waldo)|Woof]], Odlaw and the Waldo Watchers.  More Waldo books followed - such as [[Where's Waldo in Hollywood?]], [[Where's Waldo?: The Wonder Book]] (1997), [[Where's Waldo?: The Great Picture Hunt]] (2006).

Waldo became a huge pop culture sensation in the early 1990s. The United States, in particular, was swept with "Waldo-mania".  Aside from the adaptations of Handford's books, the franchises grew to include licensing of Waldo for video games, spin-off books, magazines, dolls, toys, comics and a [[Where's Waldo? (TV series)]].

Wally has his own website where he dispatches messages to fans and invites them to join in on the chase through different social networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findwally.co.uk/ FindWally.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jean Marzollo and Walter Wick I Spy===

[[I Spy (Scholastic)|I Spy]] is another interactive children’s book series that can be categorized as a hidden object picture book.  Debuting in 1992, the books consist of texts written by [[Jean Marzollo]] regarding items hidden within the photographs captured by [[Walter Wick]].

Wick’s photographs are set up in a cluttered assortment of items or to imitate a particular scene, like the toy shop window in I Spy: Christmas (1992).  Below the picture, Marzollo involves readers with a riddle asking them to locate specific items within Wick’s photograph.  Wick’s photographs are highly regarded for their expressive quality.

The series originated with I Spy: A Book of Picture Riddles (1992) and grew to include I Spy: Christmas (1992), I Spy: Fun House (1993), I Spy: Mystery (1993), I Spy: Fantasy (1994), I Spy: School Days (1995), I Spy: Spooky Night (1996), and I Spy: Treasure Hunt (1999).

A subsequent and more challenging series was begun in 1997 with I Spy: Super Challenger! (1997) and was continued with other installments such as I Spy: Gold Challenger! (1998), I Spy: Extreme Challenger! (2000), I Spy: Year-Round Challenger! (2001), and I Spy: Ultimate Challenger! (2003).

The I Spy label has grown to include video games based on the books such as [[I Spy Spooky Mansion]], [[I Spy Treasure Hunt]] and [[I Spy Fantasy]].

The franchise also includes Ultimate I Spy, an I Spy game for the [[Wii]]. I Spy: Fun House is being developed into a [[Nintendo DS]] game. The player is trapped in the actual fun-house and must find nine items to escape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ds.ign.com/articles/794/794633p1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Walter Wick is also author of his own hidden object series, similar to I Spy, called Can You See What I See?. These books feature photographs and poems that require readers to find objects in the picture. The puzzles are slightly easier than those of the I Spy books.

==Other Hidden Object Books==

Martin Handford, Jean Marzollo and Walter Wick are not the only three authors of hidden object picture books. However, they are the most established and recognized in the publishing world.  Another author worth mentioning is Gillian Doherty. She is a published author and editor of children's books. Her hidden object picture books include 1001 Monster Things to Spot, 1001 Things to Spot, 1001 Wizard Things to Spot, and 1001 Things to Spot.

== Touch and Feel books ==

Many interactive books are made specifically for children. Touch-and-feel books, or texturized books, fall in this area. The prime age for touch and feel books is from toddler-age to preschool. Because these books are aimed specifically at helping children develop knowledge while increasing the use of their senses, appeal is lost to older generations who more than likely already possess the skills being taught. One of the key advantages to teaching senses and vocabulary through the use of touch and feel books is the connection a child can gain by instantly being rewarded with the texture that the word describes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.childtrek.com/childrens-books/touch-feel-childrens-books.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107101413/http://www.childtrek.com/childrens-books/touch-feel-childrens-books.html |archivedate=2009-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, touch-and-feel books have gone to a new level with the creation of fun new ways for younger children to interact with books such as musical "bath books" and "finger puppet books". Most, but not all, of these books are also "board books", which are made entirely out of hard pages. Making the pages out of a hard material provides for durability, allowing them to resist whatever they may contact along with the young readers. Bath books can be taken into the tub because of their floatable and waterproof pages. A few of the top touch and feel book publishers are Dorling Kindersley, Usborne, Macmillan, and Lamaze.

== Pop-up books ==
Children’s pop-up books are a form of interactive literature in which upon turning the page, an image literally “pops-up”.  These books provide 3-D illustrations made of unfolding paper that allow for the child to feel as if the book is coming to life.  First created in the mid-thirteenth century, they were originally not intended for children until publisher [[Robert Sayer]] created ''Harlquinade'' in 1765.  With his creating of a “lift-the-flap” book, he gave children a way to truly become involved with what they are reading.  From then, several other authors, such as [[William Grimaldi]], designed their version of the pop-up book depicting elaborate scenes from page to page that allowed for the reader to determine the outcome of the story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.unt.edu/rarebooks/exhibits/popup2/introduction.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
The pop-up book has evolved from a seemingly simplistic idea to one of more sophistication, as well as complication.  They have grown to be a genre that delights, intrigues, and educates children of all ages.

One key person in the pop-up book phenomenon is Waldo Hunt, who was the first to develop these books in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.seattlepi.com/bookpatrol/archives/186608.asp?from=blog_last3]&lt;/ref&gt; He found joy and creativity in the idea of creating a pop-up image in a book.  He was the true advocate and mastermind behind their conception and popularity.

Pop-up books are common enough to be found in your local library, bookstore, classroom, or likely even your own bookshelf. There are several examples of these kinds of books, but some famous ones to check out are: Christmas in New York by Chuck Fischer, Star Wars: A Pop-Up Guide to the Galaxy by Matthew Reinhart, and The Amazing Pop-Up Geography Book by Kate Petty.  Pop-up books can range from very simplistic 3-D illustrations to more intricate and detailed presentations depending upon the topic of the book, its author and illustrator, as well as the age of the audience they are appealing to.

== Digitized learning books ==

Many children’s interactive books have been enhanced through the use of technology. The earliest examples of this were books that had sound effects- a bar on the side of the book that had buttons corresponding with pictures in the story. When the icon appeared in the story, the reader could press a button on the side to hear the sound effect. These are called “sound books.” Books that had accompanying cassette tapes (or even CDs), usually known as books on tape, are another early example of this.

Once computers became more prevalent, CD-ROM versions of books became popular. These were programs that put books on the computer screen, enabling children to click their way through various words and pictures in the story and have it come alive. The technology was fairly limited, however, and not widespread as only children with access to a PC (and the knowledge to use it) could take advantage of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.marketplaceadvisor.channeladvisor.com/hi/5/4830/lb-just-grandma-slv-f.jpg Richard Scarry's ''Just Grandma and Me''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The next big step in this technology was [[LeapPad|Leap Frog’s Leap Pad.]] The Leap Pad makes regular books interactive by enabling children to hear a word aloud, have the story read to them, have words and sounds spelled for them, play interactive learning games on many pages and more, simply by touching the included “pen” to different places on the page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leapfrog.com/etc/medialib/leapfrog/parent_guides/pg_prekind.Par.36099.File.dat/pg_leappad.pd Leap Pad Parents’ Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; The system is divided into “Leap Levels” for different-aged children and includes everything from picture books to chapter books, with separate Leap Pads corresponding to each level. There is also a unit that allows new content to be downloaded from Leap Frog’s Web site. The technology of the Leap Pad continued evolving, and Leap Frog next came out with the [[Tag (LeapFrog)]]. Instead of a Pad unit where books must be inserted, the Tag system is essentially a “pen” onto which books can be downloaded. Then, the pen can be scanned across the corresponding book to read it aloud, unlock activities and more.
The goal for these products is to help children get more out of their books and learn to read, according to Leap Frog.  Leap Frog even has its own publishing company, Leap Frog Press, which creates books specifically designed for its system. The products are not cheap, though- the Leap Pad can cost as much as $80. The Tag is usually sold in gift packs that run anywhere from $20 to $75. Books for each are sold separately and typically cost $12 or more.
Of course, Leap Frog is not the only company with products like the Leap Pad or Tag system that use technology to enhance the reading experience for children. However, it was one of the first, and now several companies have copied the idea and made similar products.

The newest advance in interactive children's books reflects the recent popularity of [[Amazon Kindle|Amazon's Kindle.]] There are now a plethora of e-book sites that place children's picture books, along with LeapFrog-like sound effects and word pronunciation, completely online-often for free. Some will actually read an entire story aloud. These "virtual libraries have done a lot to both preserve books and make them more available.

Here are a few examples of some interactive e-book sites for children:

*[http://www.tumblebooks.com/library/asp/customer_login.asp?accessdenied=%2Flibrary%2Fasp%2Fhome%5FTumbleBooks%2Easp Tumble Books]

Even older classic books are moving to online to keep up with the times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findwaldo.com/ ''Where’s Waldo ''series of books] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104013730/http://findwaldo.com/ |date=2010-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholastic.com/ispy/ the ''I Spy ''series of books]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Houghton MS Hyde 60 (4) - William Henry Ireland - Copy.jpg|thumb|A forgery of Shakespeare's signature by Ireland, circa 1795]]
The '''Ireland Shakespeare forgeries''' were a [[cause célèbre]] in 1790s London, when author and engraver [[Samuel Ireland]] announced the discovery of a treasure-trove of [[Shakespeare]]an manuscripts by his son [[William Henry Ireland]]. Among them were the manuscripts of four plays, two of them previously unknown.

Upon the release of the manuscripts, such respected literary figures as [[James Boswell]] (biographer of [[Samuel Johnson]]) and poet-laureate [[Henry James Pye]] pronounced them genuine, as did various antiquarian experts. [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], the leading theatre manager of his day, agreed to present one of the newly discovered plays with [[John Philip Kemble]] in the starring rôle. Excitement over the biographical and literary significance of the find turned to acrimony, however, when it was charged that the documents were forgeries. [[Edmond Malone]], widely regarded as the greatest Shakespeare scholar of his time, conclusively showed that the language, orthography, and handwriting were not those of the times and persons to which they were credited. William Henry Ireland, the supposed discoverer, then confessed to the fraud.

==Background==
Although Shakespeare's works were readily available in versions both for the learned and for the general public, no satisfactory biography could be constructed.  In spite of an intense search by would-be Shakespeare biographers from [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Nicholas Rowe]] to [[Edmond Malone]], only scraps and legends turned up.  There was an intense hope and expectation that some documents would surface to fill the gap.

Samuel Ireland was an eager collector of antique relics—his collection included a piece of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s cloak, [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s leather jacket, and [[Joseph Addison]]'s fruit knife&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Grebanier, ''The Great Shakespeare Hoax'', pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;—as well as a Shakespeare enthusiast. While gathering material for a forthcoming book, ''Picturesque Tours of the Upper, or Warwickshire Avon'', he passed through [[Stratford on Avon]], Shakespeare's birthplace, by then already capitalising on this claim to fame, and made inquiries about the life of the dramatist. Although he had the satisfaction of being the first to introduce Shakespeare's crabtree and [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare)|Anne Hathaway]]'s cottage to the general public, Shakespeare documents eluded him.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbaum, ''Shakespeare's Lives'', pp. 191–192.&lt;/ref&gt;

His son [[William Henry Ireland]] had a fascination with forgery. He was heavily influenced by the novel ''[[Love and Madness]]'' by [[Sir Herbert Croft, 5th Baronet|Herbert Croft]] which contained lengthy passages on the forger [[Thomas Chatterton]]. William witnessed his father's frustration first-hand. One moment, in particular, struck him forcibly. Knowing that the furniture and papers from [[New Place]], Shakespeare's last residence, had been moved to Clopton house when New Place was demolished, Samuel Ireland reasoned that Shakespearean manuscripts might well be found there.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Ireland, ''Picturesque Views on the Upper, or Warwickshire, Avon'' (London 1796), p. 204; William Henry says that old residents told them papers had been moved there at the time of the Stratford fire.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon visiting however, he was informed by the current tenant that all the old papers—many of them Shakespeare's—had recently been burned. Samuel Ireland's distress at this news made a strong impression on the young man—even though it later turned out that this story was a nothing more than a joke at Ireland's expense.&lt;ref&gt;William Henry Ireland related this story in the ''Authentic Account'' (pp. 5–6), the ''Confessions'' (pp. 30–33), and the unpublished ''Full and Explanatory Account'' (according to Schoenbaum, p. 192). Edmond Malone investigated the incident, writing to the owner about the propriety of a tenant destroying his landlord's papers; the tenant denied the incident and admitted it was a practical joke. Mair, pp. 19–20, and Schoenbaum, p. 193, have brief accounts of the subsequent investigation of the incident.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the younger Ireland's confessions, it was to please his father that he embarked on the career of literary forgery that would ultimately ruin them both.&lt;ref&gt;''Confessions'', p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First documents==
From a chance acquaintance met at a book-binder's the young man learned of a technique for simulating the appearance of ancient writing by using a special ink and then heating the paper.&lt;ref&gt;William Henry Ireland, ''Authentic Account'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; After a trial run creating a couple of relatively insignificant documents, he set out to devise something with Shakespeare's signature. His work at a legal firm gave him access to Elizabethan and Jacobean parchment deeds, so in December 1794 he cut a piece of parchment from one of them, used his special ink to write with and heated it over a candle. The result was a mortgage deed between Shakespeare and his fellow-actor [[John Heminges]] on one side, and Michael Fraser and his wife on the other.  The text and signature he copied from the facsimile of the genuine 1612 mortgage deed printed in Malone's edition of Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbaum, p. 197; in his published accounts William Henry Ireland claims to have used the Johnson-Steevens edition, but the Blackfriars mortgage deed he used as a basis for the forgery did not appear there, and was first printed in Malone's edition. In his unpublished accounts he admitted to using Malone's edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Ripping a seal from another early deed, young Ireland attached it to this concoction and presented the result to his father on 16 December. Samuel Ireland accepted it as authentic, and the next day took it to the Heralds' Office, which approved it as genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Mair, pp. 27–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked where he had turned up this deed, William Henry replied that he had found it in an old trunk belonging to a chance acquaintance who did not wish to have his name revealed.  Mr. H., as he called him, had freely given him this deed.  The young discoverer suggested that there might well be more documents where this had come from,&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Kahan, p. 57, based on Samuel Ireland's unpublished records; William Henry later revised this in his ''Confessions'' (p. 55) to claim that he never would have continued had not others suggested to him to possibility of finding more documents.&lt;/ref&gt; and quickly followed this up with a promissory note from Shakespeare to Heminges—the only such note (had it been genuine) ever discovered from the period.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Grebanier; ''The Great Shakespeare Forgery'', pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further forgeries==
With his next discovery William Henry moved from mere forgery to original art.&lt;ref&gt;Mair, ''The Fourth Forger'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Having learned—apparently from a chance remark by one of his father's friends rather than by research—that [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton]] had been Shakespeare's patron, he decided to create correspondence between them.&lt;ref&gt;William Henry Ireland, ''Confessions'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; "Doe notte esteeme me a sluggarde nor tardye for thus havyinge delayed to answerre or rather toe thank you for youre greate Bountye," he has Shakespeare write sans punctuation.  "[G]ratitude is alle I have toe utter and that is tooe greate ande tooe sublyme a feeling for poore mortalls toe expresse O my Lord itte is a Budde which Bllossommes Bllooms butte never dyes." The Earl of Southampton replies in a similar vein, also sans punctuation, and with a similar spelling: “…as I have beene thye Freynde soe will I continue aughte thatte I canne doe forre thee praye commande me ande you shalle fynde mee Yours Southampton”.&lt;ref&gt;Text from Samuel Ireland, ''Miscellaneous Papers and Legal Instruments under the Hand and Seal of William Shakspeare'', 1796.&lt;/ref&gt; To explain how both letters could end up together in the same collection William Henry added a note explaining that Shakespeare’s was a “Copye” of the letter he sent. Samuel Ireland and his friends admired the style of the letters but not the earl’s penmanship; William Henry, not knowing that handwriting of the earl was extant, had written Southampton’s reply with his left hand.&lt;ref&gt;''Confessions'', pp. 78–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

A flood of documents now followed, all coming from Mr. H’s ostensibly-miraculous chest. Shakespeare’s “Profession of Faith” proved he was a Protestant, a letter to fellow-actor [[Richard Cowley]] showed he was "a perfect good natured man",&lt;ref&gt;William Henry Ireland, ''Authentic Account'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and a letter from [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] made it clear that he was favoured by the most powerful person in the land. A sketch of himself that accompanied his letter to Cowley showed that he was a wretched draftsman with an impenetrable sense of humour. Described in the letter as a "whysycalle conceyte", it was (as Malone put it) "most truly whimsical, being a miserable drawing of our poet done by himself with a pen, from Martin Droeshout's print of him engraved seven years after his death…."&lt;ref&gt;Edmond Malone, ''An Inquiry into the Authenticity of Certain Papers and Instruments Attributed to Shakespeare'', p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also theatrical receipts, contracts, a letter and poem to his future wife, [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare)|"Anna Hatherrewaye"]], and even books from Shakespeare's library, complete with marginal annotations actually signed by the bard himself. Of most interest, however, were a manuscript of ''[[King Lear]]'' Shakespeare had prepared for the press, a few stray leaves of "''[[Hamlet|Hamblette]]''", and two previously unknown plays, ''[[Vortigern and Rowena]]'' and ''Henry II''.

==Artifacts on display==
From the moment of discovery Samuel Ireland invited friends in to see his new possessions. On 20 December 1794 [[Frederick Morton Eden|Sir Frederick Eden]] came to examine the seal on the Fraser lease. He announced that it represented a [[quintain (jousting)|quintain]], a device used in lance practice, and the conclusion was that Shakespeare had used it as a play on his own name.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Schoenbaum, ''Shakespeare's Lives'', p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1795 however he issued a general invitation to literary men to come to his house and examine them. The exhibition was a roaring success. [[Samuel Parr]] and [[Joseph Warton]] on hearing Samuel Ireland read the "Profession of Faith" proclaimed it superior to anything in the English liturgy. [[James Boswell]] got down on his knees to kiss the relics. Scottish antiquarian [[George Chalmers (antiquarian)|George Chalmers]] and educator [[Richard Valpy]] visited frequently, and editor [[James Boaden]], author [[Sir Herbert Croft, 5th Baronet|Herbert Croft]], and poet-laureate [[Henry James Pye]] (among others) testified publicly to their belief in the authenticity of the papers.&lt;ref&gt;DNB, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

One hitch developed when an alert visitor noted that a document supposedly written by the [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]] was dated 1590, whereas the nobleman had died in 1588.&lt;ref&gt;Kahan, ''Reforging Shakespeare'', p. 86; Samuel Schoenbaum, ''Shakespeare's Lives'', p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; When Samuel Ireland confronted his son with this information, William Henry wanted to burn the document, but his father demurred. He suggested that the document might have been misdated at some later time, and the two agreed to tear off the date.&lt;ref&gt;William Henry Ireland, ''A Full and Explanatory Account'', MS, cited in Schoenbaum, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; The item was displayed, and subsequently printed, in this mutilated form. At least two scholars, antiquary [[Joseph Ritson]]&lt;ref&gt;Ritson to Paton, 21 July 1795 in ''The Letters of Joseph Ritson'', volume 2, pp. 91–93.&lt;/ref&gt; and classicist [[Richard Porson]],&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Grebanier, ''The Great Shakespeare Forgery'', p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; correctly recognised the documents as forgeries, and editor [[Henry Bate Dudley]] started lampooning the papers as early as 17 February 1795.&lt;ref&gt;Grebanier, p. 127, Schoenbaum, p. 212; Mair, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Samuel Ireland did not invite the two greatest Shakespeare scholars of the day, Edmond Malone and [[George Steevens]], to examine the manuscripts, suspicion was aroused.  As one writer noted "The publick would certainly have been gratified to know, that these extraordinary MSS. had been deemed genuine by Dr. Farmer, Messrs. Stevens or Malone; whose literary characters might have served as letters of credence."&lt;ref&gt;''Gentleman's Magazine'', March 1795, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Ireland later observed that he was "of a different sentiment with regard to the sanction, which his [Malone's] inspection would afford them."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Ireland, ''An Investigation of Mr. Malone's Claim to the Character of Scholar, or Critic'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; He did however attempt to get [[Richard Farmer]] to look at the papers without success.&lt;ref&gt;Grebanier, pp. 136–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition, which roused much public excitement, continued for more than a year.  On 17 November Ireland and his son carried the papers to St. James's Palace, where the Duke of Clarence and Mrs. Jordan examined them, and on 30 December Ireland submitted them to the Prince of Wales at Carlton House.&lt;ref&gt;DNB.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Vortigern and Rowena''==
{{main|Vortigern and Rowena}}

As early as 26 December 1794 William Henry had announced the existence of Shakespeare's unknown play ''Vortigern and Rowena'', but it was not until March that he was able to present his father with the manuscript. It came with Shakespeare's correspondence with a printer purporting to explain why the play was unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;Kahan, pp. 62–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] of [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] and [[Thomas Harris (theatre manager)|Thomas Harris]] of [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] expressed an interest in producing the play. Sheridan was the winner in this competition. Prompted by fears that a descendant of Shakespeare might surface to claim the rights to his productions, William Henry produced a deed to prove that one of his ancestors, coincidentally named William Henry Ireland, had saved Shakespeare from drowning, and that Shakespeare had rewarded him with all the newly discovered manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;William Henry Ireland, ''Authentic Account''. pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication of the MSS==
Samuel Ireland announced the publication of the papers on 4 March 1795, and the volume itself appeared in December of that year. William Henry had bitterly opposed this move, but his father was determined. Included were such items as the "Profession of Faith," the letter from Queen Elizabeth, and the manuscript of ''King Lear''. ''Henry II'', ''Vortigern'', and the marginalia were excluded from this volume.

Shortly after the appearance of the book Samuel Ireland's neighbour, [[Albany Wallis]], who had discovered one of the few authentic signatures of Shakespeare, came up with a new and startling discovery. He had turned up a genuine John Heminges signature, and of course it looked nothing like the signatures William Henry had produced. When the forger learned of this problem, however, he soon produced Heminges signatures that resembled the authentic one. It seems, William Henry explained, that there were ''two'' actors named John Heminges active at the time—hence the dissimilar signatures.

==Controversy==
The volume was not well received. The first reply was James Boaden's ''A Letter to George Steevens'' (16 January 1796).&lt;ref&gt;Eu. Hood, "Fly-Leaves, No. XXXI: Pseudo-Shakspeare," in ''Gentleman's Magazine'', May 1826, p.421.&lt;/ref&gt; Boaden concentrated on the manuscript of ''Lear'', observing that if this is Shakespeare's original, and the printed versions contaminated with alterations by the actors, then the players are "at once converted ... into the most elaborate and polished masters of versification, and Shakspeare into a writer without the necessary ear for rhythm—a man who produced a series of harmonious versification by chance, and lost the supreme ascendancy in his art, from the not being able to number ten syllables upon his fingers." He also took aim at the spelling.&lt;ref&gt;James Boaden, ''A Letter to George Steevens'', pp. 7, 21; summary in Grebanier, pp. 185–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Ireland's friends and supporters raced in with replies. Colonel [[Francis Webb (colonel)|Francis Webb]], writing under the name "Philalethes," argued that as the paper was old the documents must have belonged to Shakespeare's time; there would have been no reason to forge them then; therefore they must be genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Summary in Grebanier, p. 189ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Wyatt took potshots at Boaden by contrasting his views as a believer with those after his conversion. [[Walley Chamberlain Oulton]] maintained that the papers were so voluminous that forgery was out of the question. He expressed a hope that ''Vortigern'' would turn out to be genuine, as it might well revitalise contemporary drama. He looked to the judgment of the audience for the play's vindication.

==Exposure==
Two crushing blows came quickly. The first was the publication of Malone's volume of over four hundred pages on 31 March 1796. Exposing the forgeries in detail, he showed one by one that each document was flawed in its handwriting, its language, its orthography, and its history. The spelling of the documents was not only not that of Shakespeare's time, it was that of no time whatsoever. Numerous historical inaccuracies—not least of which was the reference to the [[Globe Theatre|Globe]] before that playhouse had been built—exposed the forger's ignorance. The handwriting of the Queen and Southampton did not at all resemble authentic examples. Words appearing in the forgeries (''upset'', for example) were not used in Shakespeare's time, or were used in a different sense than that of the papers.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, ''An Inquiry into the Authenticity of Certain Miscellaneous Papers and Legal Instruments'', ''passim''. For the general objection to the spelling of the papers, see p. 33. For the anachronistic reference to the Globe see pp. 184–8. For Queen Elizabeth's handwriting see pp. 103–116. For the word ''upset'' see pp. 219–220.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Vortigern's'' failure==
The second blow came two days later, on 2 April, with the failure of ''Vortigern'' at Drury Lane Theatre. The excitement was intense and the crowd volatile; tickets had sold out early and seats were hard come by. While at first the play seemed to be a success with the audience, soon fits of laughter were heard and at one point the play came to a complete halt till order was restored. When Barrymore announced another performance of the play, the audience rebelled, and chaos reigned until the management substituted something else.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Farington, diary entry for 2 April 1796, in ''the Farington Diary'' (London 1922–28), p. 145; [[James Anson Farrer]], ''Literary Forgeries'' (London, 1907), pp. 226–232.&lt;/ref&gt; William Henry Ireland blamed the actors, particularly Kemble, along with a "Malone faction," for the failure of his play.&lt;ref&gt;''Confessions'', pp. 156–159.&lt;/ref&gt; Others attributed it to the quality of the play itself.&lt;ref&gt;Farington, ''op. cit.''; William P. Marsh, ''Clubs of London'' (London, 1828), volume 2, pp. 107–111.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vortigern's'' opening night was also its final performance.

==Aftermath==
For the Irelands, father and son, the failure of the play, coupled with Malone's exposure of the hoax, was an unmitigated disaster. Samuel Ireland still believed the papers to be Shakespeare's, and refused to listen to anything his son had to say. William Henry confessed the forgery to his sisters, to his mother, and to Albany Wallis, but his father did not believe his story. The public, not surprisingly, accused Samuel Ireland of the fraud. Sales of his books suffered.&lt;ref&gt;DNB p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blaming Malone for his misfortunes, Samuel Ireland set out to write a book that would destroy the scholar's reputation. With the aid of [[Thomas Caldecott (barrister)|Thomas Caldecott]] he attacked Malone for using forensic techniques like handwriting comparison to settle a literary question, rather than relying on taste and aesthetic sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;DNB, p. 35; Samuel Ireland, ''Investigation''; see especially 46–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned for his father's reputation William Henry rushed into print with a pamphlet confessing to the forgeries, and his father replied immediately with a vindication of his conduct in the whole affair.&lt;ref&gt;Hood, p. 422. William Henry Ireland says in the opening statement to the ''Authentic Account'' that his motive is "to remove the odium under which my father labours".&lt;/ref&gt; This combination roused suspicions. George Steevens accused the two of collusion:&lt;blockquote&gt;The hopeful youth takes on himself the guilt of the entire forgery, and strains hard to exculpate his worthy father from the slightest participation in it. The father, on the contrary, declares that his son had not sufficient abilities for the execution of so difficult a task. Between them, in short, there is a pretended quarrel, that they may not look as if they were acting in concert on the present occasion.&lt;ref&gt;George Steevens to Bishop Percy, 26 December 1796, in John Bowyers Nichols, ''Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century'' (London, 1848), volume 7, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The charge would stick. George Chalmers' ''Apology for the Believers'' and Samuel Ireland's ''Investigation'' concentrated on attacking Malone rather than exonerating Samuel, and the public verdict was probably summed up in a print by John Nixon depicting the entire Ireland family engaged in forging the papers.&lt;ref&gt;DNB, p. 35. The Nixon print, "The Oaken Chest, or, The Gold Mines of Ireland a Farce is available at the [http://www.folger.edu/html/exhibitions/fakes_forgeries/FFFireland.asp Folger Library web site].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Samuel Ireland's culpability==
The culpability of Samuel Ireland remained a controversial topic for years to come. Although his son's ''Confessions'' (1805) did a great deal to establish his innocence, not everybody was convinced. Accounts by [[Clement Mansfield Ingleby]] in 1859 and George Dawson in 1888 took the position that the father was responsible for the forgeries and the son's ''Confession'' was a tissue of lies. The acquisition of Samuel Ireland's papers by the British Museum in 1876, however, provided a wealth of evidence that Samuel was the victim rather than the perpetrator of the fraud, and Ingleby changed his position in his 1881 paper on the Ireland Affair.&lt;ref&gt;"The Literary Career of a Shakespeare Forger" in volume 2 of ''Shakespeare: the Man and the Book.'' This issue is covered on pp. 156–163. See also Farrer, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
After Samuel Ireland's death in 1800, the original forgeries, bound in three folio volumes, were sold to [[John Dent (died 1826)|John "Dog" Dent]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]] and bibliophile. The collections passed through several hands before being acquired by [[Mary Eccles, Viscountess Eccles|Mary Morley Crapo Hyde]] (1912—2003) and her first husband, Donald Hyde (1909—1966). She left the volumes to [[Harvard]]'s [[Houghton Library]] after her death.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Arthur. "The Actual Originals" in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' 5716 (19 October 2012), pp. 14—15.&lt;/ref&gt;

British writer [[Peter Ackroyd]] provides an imaginative account of the Ireland's forgeries in his novel ''The Lambs of London'' published by Chatto &amp; Windus in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ackroyd (2004) ''The Lambs of London'', 228 pages. Chatto &amp; Windus London, {{ISBN|0-7011-7744-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast [[Martyn Wade]]'s play about the forgeries, ''Another Shakespeare''.&lt;ref&gt;Repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra, 18/19 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Linnell''' (16 June 1792 – 20 January 1882) was an [[England|English]] [[landscape painter|landscape]] and [[portrait]] [[painting|painter]] and [[engraving|engraver]]. Linnell was a [[naturalist]] and a rival to [[John Constable]]. He had a taste for Northern European art of the [[Renaissance]], particularly [[Albrecht Dürer]]. He also associated with [[William Blake]], to whom he introduced [[Samuel Palmer]] and others of [[Ancients (art group)|the Ancients]].

==Life and work==
Linnell was born in [[Bloomsbury]], London. His father was a carver and gilder and Linnell was brought into contact with artists from an early age, and was drawing and selling portraits in chalk and pencil at the age of 10. His first artistic instruction was received from [[Benjamin West]], and he spent a year in the house of [[John Varley (painter)|John Varley]] the water-colour painter, where he had [[William Henry Hunt (painter)|William Hunt]] and [[William Mulready]] as fellow-pupils, and made the acquaintance of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], [[Edward William Godwin|Godwin]] and other men of mark. In 1805 he was admitted a student of the Royal Academy, where he obtained medals for drawing, modelling and sculpture. He was trained as an engraver, and executed a transcript of Varley's "Burial of Saul."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
[[File:John Linnell - Hanson Toot, View in Dovedale - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|View in [[Dovedale]], 1815]]

In later life he occupied himself with the [[Burin (engraving)|burin]], publishing, in 1833, a series of outlines from [[Michelangelo]]'s frescoes in the [[Sistine Chapel]], and, in 1840, superintending the issue of a selection of plates from the pictures in [[Buckingham Palace]], one of them, a [[Titian]] landscape, which he engraved in [[mezzotint]]. At first he supported himself mainly by miniature painting and execution of larger portraits, such as the likenesses of Mulready, [[Richard Whately]], Peel and [[Thomas Carlyle]]. Several of his portraits he engraved in line and mezzotint.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He painted many subjects like the "St John Preaching," the "Covenant of Abraham," and the "Journey to Emmaus," in which, while the landscape is usually prominent the figures are of sufficient importance to supply the title of the work. But it is mainly in connexion with paintings of pure landscapes that his name is known. His works commonly deal with some scene of typical uneventful English landscape, which is made impressive by a gorgeous effect of sunrise or sunset. They are full of true poetic feeling, and are rich and glowing in colour.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Linnell commanded large prices for his pictures, and about 1850 he purchased a property at Redhill, Surrey, where he lived till his death on 20 January 1882, painting with unabated powers until within the last few years of his life. He devoted himself to painting landscapes notably of the [[North Downs]] and [[The Weald|Kentish Weald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilton and Lyles|first=Andrew Wilton and Anne Lyles, Royal Academy of Arts (Great Britain), National Gallery of Art (U.S.)|title=The great age of British watercolours, 1750-1880|year=1993|publisher=Prestel-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=9783791312545|pages=339}} page 318&lt;/ref&gt;  His leisure was occupied with a study of the [[Bible]] in the original, and he published several pamphlets and treatises of Biblical criticism. Linnell was one of the best friends and kindest patrons of [[William Blake]]. He gave him the two largest commissions he received for single series of designs—£150 for drawings and engravings of ''The Inventions to the Book of Job'', and a like sum for those illustrative of [[Dante Aligheri]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He was a friend of the painter [[Edward Thomas Daniell]]. A [[blue plaque]] commemorates Linnell at Old Wyldes' at North End, [[Hampstead]]. The plaque mentions that William Blake stayed with Linnell as his guest.&lt;ref name='EngHet'&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/blake-william-1757-1827|title=BLAKE, WILLIAM (1757-1827) &amp; LINNELL, JOHN (1792-1882)|publisher=English Heritage| accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Junior''''' is a 1994 American [[comedy film]] directed and produced by [[Ivan Reitman]], and starring [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Danny DeVito]] and [[Emma Thompson]]. The film was released in the United States on November 23, 1994. The film follows Alex Hesse, an Austrian-American scientist who agrees to undergo a [[male pregnancy]] as part of a scientific experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= MOVIES : High Atop Mount Goofiness : When it comes to taking an unlikely premise--say, a pregnant Schwarzenegger--and turning it into a blockbuster comedy, nobody's earned his stripes like Ivan Reitman.|publisher= The Los Angeles Times|date=1994-11-20|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-11-20/entertainment/ca-65006_1_ivan-reitman|accessdate=2010-12-02|first=Michael|last=Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the film's lukewarm reception, Schwarzenegger and Thompson received [[52nd Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] nominations for their performances. The film's theme song, [[Patty Smyth]]'s "Look What Love Has Done" was also recognized, going on to be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. It is also Schwarzenegger's third collaboration with DeVito, following 1988's ''[[Twins (1988 film)|Twins]]'' and 1993's ''[[Last Action Hero]]'', and second with [[Pamela Reed]] after 1990's ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]''.

==Plot==

Austrian Research geneticist Dr. Alex Hesse ([[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]) and his [[obstetrician|OB]]/[[gynecologist|GYN]] colleague Dr. Larry Arbogast ([[Danny DeVito]]) have invented a [[fertility drug]], "Expectane", that is supposed to reduce the chances of a woman's body rejecting an [[embryo]] and thus prevent a [[miscarriage]]. Unfortunately, they are not allowed to test it on women since the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] has not yet approved the drug; so Hesse and Arbogast cannot move forward in their research. The head of the review board, Noah Banes ([[Frank Langella]]), informs Arbogast that while the FDA has denied their team the right of human experimentation, the team has managed to receive a donation from fellow geneticist Dr. Diana Reddin ([[Emma Thompson]]) from the [[ovum]] cryogenics department.

A disappointed Hesse is ready to leave and start over in Europe, but Arbogast convinces him that in spite of the FDA's decision, they can still perform the "Expectane" experiment, because he has talked with a Canadian firm called the Lyndon Pharmaceutical, who is willing to give the two additional funding for their work provided that they find a volunteer for the experiment. When Hesse questions the chances of a woman taking an unapproved drug during pregnancy, Arbogast reveals that there is no need to identify the gender of the experiment and convinces Hesse to impregnate himself, using an ovum codenamed "Junior".

That night, Hesse has a nightmare in which his potential offspring has [[Terminator (character)|his own face]] pasted onto it. As the weeks go by, he complains to Arbogast that his nipples are hurting him, and then later, the normally aloof Hesse inexplicably lightens up and chats incessantly about walks, massages, and naps. At one point, Reddin tells Hesse that being a woman is not as great as it sounds, citing the [[menstrual cycle]]s which do not stop until [[menopause]]. Meanwhile, Arbogast's pregnant ex-wife, Angela ([[Pamela Reed]]), wants Arbogast to be the doctor delivering her baby, as the man she is seeing is currently hanging out with the band [[Aerosmith]]. Hesse begins to wonder what it would be like to be a father and watches some television commercials to have himself a good sobbing. He later begins overreacting, with Angela noting his practice of "mixing cuisines". When it comes time for Hesse to stop taking the drug and release the experiment's full results to the Lyndon Pharmaceutical, Hesse chooses not to stop taking the drug and decides to carry his offspring to term. Arbogast is annoyed that Hesse is choosing to have his offspring, but soon deals with it and attempts to keep it hidden from others. Hesse goes through his pregnancy term while he develops a relationship with Reddin, as well as revealing his pregnancy to Angela.

It is revealed that the "Junior" ovum is actually from Reddin's own body, making her the mother of Hesse's child, a fact which leaves Reddin angry and stunned at Hesse. Banes soon learns about the situation, and wants to take credit for the experiment despite having no role in it. Arbogast disguises Hesse as a woman and hides him in a retreat for expecting mothers outside the city, passing off his masculine appearance as past anabolic steroid use. Eventually, Hesse receives a visit from Reddin, who tells him it doesn't matter who's the pregnant one, because on the whole, Hesse is the father, and Reddin is the mother. Meanwhile, Arbogast reveals the experiment and its data to the Lyndon Pharmaceutical, who agree to become partners with Hesse and Arbogast and give the experiment potential for other future uses.

Later, Hesse starts going into labor, experiencing abdominal pain due to the damage that the baby is doing to his abdomen. While shut away in his resort room, Hesse calls both Arbogast and Reddin. As Reddin rushes to the resort from the laboratory, Arbogast calls a fellow doctor and tells him to evacuate the hospital and prep it for an emergency c-section for Hesse, but a hospital staffer overhears the doctor's conversation and alerts Banes about it. Banes calls the media to the hospital, to take credit and become famous, but Arbogast's fellow doctor alerts him about the media and Arbogast makes a detour to get a decoy for Hesse so he can have a private c-section. When Arbogast's car arrives at the hospital, he disappoints the media when he brings out his own pregnant ex-wife. Banes, who had summoned the university dean and the press to witness the world's first pregnant man, is discredited and fired.

Meanwhile, Reddin and Hesse have snuck to the back of the hospital and use the fire escape to get in. While acting as Hesse's decoy double, at the hospital, Angela goes into labor. Hesse has an emergency [[caesarean section]], where he is given an [[epidural]] even though he's at high risk, as is the baby. Reddin, not being able to help Hesse through this time, is sent by Arbogast to keep Angela company. Reddin walks into the waiting room to find Angela in labor and ends up being her labor coach, since there's no hospital staff available. Hesse feels emotionally scared and horrible, as Arbogast and the other surgeon cut through the last few layers of tissue to get to the baby; Hesse eventually gives birth to a healthy baby girl. Arbogast announces the arrival to Reddin, who is on hands and knees helping Angela cope with contractions. Reddin hands Angela over to Arbogast and rushes off to see Hesse as Arbogast has Angela prepped for childbirth. Reddin visits Hesse in the Post-op, getting her first glance at her baby, and together, they decide to name the baby girl Junior. Arbogast delivers Angela's child and the two reconcile to raise the boy, Jake, as their own.

In the final scene, the two families are on a beach on vacation celebrating the birthdays of Junior and Jake. Reddin is shown to be heavily pregnant with her and Hesse's second child. When Angela mentions that she would like to have another baby but does not want to go through pregnancy again, they all begin trying to convince a reluctant Arbogast to carry the child.

Notably [[Roger Ebert]] was a fan of the film, giving it 3{{sfrac|1|2}} out of four stars and maintaining that: "I know this sounds odd, but Schwarzenegger is perfect for the role. Observe his acting carefully in ''Junior'', and you'll see skills that many 'serious' actors could only envy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19941123/REVIEWS/411230303/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Junior|date= 1994-11-23|accessdate=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ebert and his partner [[Gene Siskel]] gave the film "two thumbs up" on their television show.

{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}

In May 2007, [[Sandy Smith]] had launched an essay writing competition, asking entrants to attempt to prove that ''Junior'' could be considered the greatest movie of all time. He obsessively started collecting copies of the movie in November 2005, and eventually collected 24 copies. In February 2008, despite ''[[Sunday Herald]]'' covering the story,&lt;ref&gt;McCracken, Edd. [http://www.heraldscotland.com/arnie-s-one-joke-movie-made-into-work-of-art-1.828472 Arnie's 'one-joke' movie made into work of art], ''Sunday Herald'', February 24, 2008. Retrieved on November 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the competition received fewer entries than there were prizes offered.

The following is an alphabetical list of works of art that are often called by a non-English name in an English context. (Of course, many such titles are simply the names of people: ''[[Don Quixote]]'', ''[[Irma la Douce]]'', ''[[Madame Bovary]]'', ''[[Tosca]]'', ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande]]''. These have been omitted, as have examples where the English may easily be inferred: ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'', ''[[Les liaisons dangereuses]]''.)

'''''Lost Illusions''''' (French: ''lllusions Perdues'') is a painting by [[Charles Gleyre]] and his student Leon Dussart, commissioned by [[William Thompson Walters]] in 1865.

==History==
[[Charles Gleyre]] was known as an artist of classic methods but romantic tastes who often modified heroism into idyllic scenes. However, in execution he was not considered romantic, due to his use of pale colors, his delicate drawing style, and uncertain light.&lt;ref name="Van Dyke"&gt;Van Dyke, ''A Text-Book of the History of Painting'', Forgotten Books, 2012, p. 155, {{ISBN|1-4400-9150-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1843 Salon (in Paris), Gleyre received praise for ''The Evening''. In 1865, William T. Walters would commission a replica of the painting which was completed by Gleyre and Dussart and is now also known as ''Lost Illusions''.&lt;ref name="Johnston76"&gt;Johnston, W., ''Nineteenth-Century Art: From Romanticism to Art Nouveau'', The Walters Art Gallery, 2000, p. 76 {{ISBN|1-85759-226-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Composition==
''Lost Illusions'' depicts a vision Gleyre experienced one evening while on the banks of the Nile. It represents a despondent scene and uses softened tones. In the scene, an aging poet watches as a mysterious "bark" drifts away with his youthful illusions. The illusions are represented by maidens playing instruments and a cupid scattering flowers.&lt;ref name="Johnston76-78"&gt;Johnston, W., ''Nineteenth-Century Art: From Romanticism to Art Nouveau'', The Walters Art Gallery, 2000, p. 76-78 {{ISBN|1-85759-226-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Off the Wall''==
''Lost Illusions'' is featured in ''Off the Wall'', an open-air exhibition on the streets of [[Baltimore]], Maryland. A reproduction of the painting, the original is part of [[The Walters Art Museum]] collection, was on display through January 2014 in O'Donnell Square.&lt;ref name="Off the Wall"&gt;[http://thewalters.org/offthewall/ Walters Art Museum - Off the Wall]&lt;/ref&gt; The National Gallery in London began the concept of bringing art out of doors in 2007 and the Detroit Institute of Art introduced the concept in the U.S.. The ''Off the Wall'' reproductions of the Walters' paintings are done on weather-resistant vinyl and include a description of the painting and a QR code for smart phones.&lt;ref name="The Baltimore Sun"&gt;Smith, T., Walters Art Museum goes of the wall, The Baltimore Sun, September 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikisource|Mrs Warren's Profession}}
'''''Mrs. Warren's Profession''''' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] written by [[George Bernard Shaw]] in 1893, and first performed in London in 1902. The play is about a former prostitute, now a madam ([[brothel]] proprietor), who attempts to come to terms with her disapproving daughter. It is a [[problem play]], offering social commentary to illustrate Shaw's belief that the act of prostitution was not caused by moral failure but by economic necessity. Elements of the play were borrowed from Shaw's 1882 novel ''[[Cashel Byron's Profession]]'', about a man who becomes a boxer due to limited employment opportunities.

==Summary==

The story centres on the relationship between Mrs Kitty Warren and her daughter, Vivie. Mrs. Warren, a former prostitute and current [[brothel]] owner, is described as "on the whole, a genial and fairly presentable old [[wikt:blackguard|blackguard]] of a woman." Vivie, an intelligent and pragmatic young woman who has just graduated from university, has come home to get acquainted with her mother for the first time in her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 2011-02-07
  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;
  |  year = 1902}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The play focuses on how their relationship changes when Vivie learns what her mother does for a living. It explains why Mrs. Warren became a prostitute, condemns the hypocrisies relating to prostitution, and criticises the limited employment opportunities available for women in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] Britain.

==Plot==

Vivie Warren, a thoroughly modern young woman, has just graduated from the [[University of Cambridge]] with honours in Mathematics (equal Third [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler]]), and is available for suitors. Her mother, Mrs. Warren (her name changed to hide her identity and give the impression that she is married), arranges for her to meet her friend Mr. Praed, a middle-aged, handsome architect, at the home where Vivie is staying. Mrs. Warren arrives with her business partner, Sir George Crofts, who is attracted to Vivie despite their 25-year age difference. Vivie is romantically involved with the youthful Frank Gardner, who sees her as his meal ticket. His father, the (married) Reverend Samuel Gardner, has a history with Vivie's mother. As we discover later, he may be Vivie's out-of-wedlock father, which would make Vivie and Frank half-siblings. Mrs. Warren successfully justifies to her daughter how she chose her particular profession in order to support her daughter and give her the opportunities she never had. She saved enough money to buy into the business with her sister, and she now owns (with Sir George) a chain of brothels across Europe. Vivie is, at first, horrified by the revelation, but then lauds her mother as a champion. However, the reconciliation ends when Vivie finds out that her mother continues to run the business even though she no longer needs to. Vivie takes an office job in the city and dumps Frank, vowing she will never marry. She disowns her mother, and Mrs. Warren is left heartbroken, having looked forward to growing old with her daughter.

==Characters==

*'''Mrs. Kitty Warren''': An attractive, middle-aged businesswoman and former prostitute, made wealthy by running a string of brothels.
*'''Mr. Praed''': A friend of Mrs. Warren, middle-aged and attractive, a good man.
*'''Sir George Crofts''': Mrs. Warren's business partner. A middle-aged, stodgy, entitled member of the upper class.
*'''Reverend Samuel Gardner''': A local minister and (possibly) Vivie's biological father.
*'''Vivie Warren''': Mrs. Warren's daughter, recently graduated from university with honours.
*'''Frank Gardner''': Youthful son of Reverend Gardner.

==Origins==
Shaw said he wrote the play "to draw attention to the truth that prostitution is caused, not by female depravity and male licentiousness, but simply by underpaying, undervaluing and overworking women so shamefully that the poorest of them are forced to resort to prostitution to keep body and soul together."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Cambridge companion to Victorian and Edwardian theatre |first=Kerry |last=Powell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ICi7QY_VSA8C&amp;pg=PA229 |page=229 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-79536-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He explained the source of the play in a letter to the ''[[Daily Chronicle (United Kingdom)|Daily Chronicle]]'' on 28 April 1898:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Miss [[Janet Achurch]] [an actress and friend of Shaw’s] mentioned to me a novel by some [[French people|French]] writer [''Yvette'' by [[Guy de Maupassant]]] as having a dramatisable story in it. It being hopeless to get me to read anything, she told me the story... In the following autumn I was the guest of a lady [Beatrice Webb] of very distinguished ability—one whose knowledge of English social types is as remarkable as her command of industrial and political questions. She suggested that I should put on the stage a real modern lady of the governing class—not the sort of thing that theatrical and critical authorities imagine such a lady to be. I did so; and the result was Miss Vivie Warren ... Mrs. Warren herself was my version of the heroine of the romance narrated by Miss Achurch. The tremendously effective scene—which a baby could write if its sight were normal—in which she justifies herself, is only a paraphrase of a scene in a novel of my own, ''[[Cashel Byron's Profession]]'' (hence the title, ''Mrs Warren's Profession''), in which a prize-fighter shows how he was driven into the ring exactly as Mrs. Warren was driven on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Mrs. Warren's Profession Study Guide| work =| pages =25–26| publisher =Guthrie Theater| year =2003| url =http://www.guthrietheater.org/sites/default/files/mrswarren.pdf| format =| doi =| accessdate =2008-08-14| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071031110511/http://www.guthrietheater.org/sites/default/files/mrswarren.pdf| archivedate =2007-10-31| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Performance history==

According to a note in Cornell University Library's archive, playwright George Bernard Shaw referred to Evans as "the most artistic of photographers."]]
The play was originally banned by the [[Lord Chamberlain]] ([[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]'s official theatre [[Censorship|censor]]) because of its frank discussion of [[prostitution]], but was finally performed on Sunday, 5 January 1902, at [[London]]'s New Lyric Club with the distinguished actor-manager [[Harley Granville-Barker]] as Frank, [[Fanny Brough]] as Mrs. Warren, George Goodhart as Sir George Crofts, Julius Knight as Praed, Madge McIntosh as Vivie and Cosmo Stuart as Rev. Samuel Gardner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3qaAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Mrs.+Warren's+Profession%22+1902+cast#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Mrs. Warren's Profession: A Play in Four Acts|first=Bernard|last=Shaw|date=8 April 2018|publisher=A.

The first public performance in London took place in 1925.

A 1905 performance in [[New York City|New York]], this time on a public stage, was interrupted by the [[NYPD|police]], who arrested the cast and crew for violating New York City's version of the [[Comstock laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnold Daley Held for his Shaw Play |publisher=The New York Times |date=November 15, 1905 |url=http://0-search.proquest.com.iii.slcl.org/hnpnewyorktimes/docview/96493562/136D710970162E53BFE |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was later held not to be in violation of the law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Court Approves Bernard Shaw's Play |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 7, 1906 |url=http://0-search.proquest.com.iii.slcl.org/hnpnewyorktimes/docview/96637422/136D710970162E53BFE |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been revived on Broadway five times since.

The play has been twice revived by the National Theatre, first in 1970-71 at the Old Vic, directed by Ronald Eyre, with Coral Browne and Sarah Badel, and more recently at the Lyttelton Theatre in 1985-86, directed by Anthony Page, with Joan Plowright and Jessica Turner as Mrs Warren and Vivie.

The [[Shaw Festival]] at [[Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario]] has mounted the play five times since the Festival's inception in 1962: 1976, 1990, 1997, 2008, and 2016 

In 2006, it was revived off-broadway by [[Irish Repertory Theatre|The Irish Repertory Theatre]], with [[Dana Ivey]] as Mrs. Warren, Laura Odeh as Vivie Warren, and [[David Staller]] as Mr. Praed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://irishrep.org/show/2005-2006-season/mrs-warrens-profession/|title=Mrs. Warren's Profession - Irish Repertory Theatre|author=|date=|website=irishrep.org|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was revived in 2010 in three separate venues:

* London's West End, at the [[Comedy Theatre]] with [[Felicity Kendal]] in the title role
* [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], by the [[Shakespeare Theatre Company]] at [[Sidney Harman Hall]], with [[Elizabeth Ashley]] in the title role
* [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[American Airlines Theatre]] under the auspices of the [[Roundabout Theatre Company]], with [[Cherry Jones]] as Kitty Warren and [[Sally Hawkins]] as Vivie

It was performed by the [[Sydney Theatre Company]] in 2012, and was so popular that the season was extended.

In 2016 the play was performed at the Center Theatre in Seattle.

In 2018, Eleanor Bishop's adaptation of the play was performed at the ASB Waterfront Theatre in Auckland, New Zealand by the Auckland Theatre Company.

==Sequel==
Sir [[Harry Johnston]] wrote a sequel, a novel entitled ''Mrs. Warren's Daughter'', circa 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15380|title=Mrs. Warren's Daughter: A Story of the Woman's Movement by Harry Johnston|author=|date=|website=gutenberg.org|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
A 1960 German film adaption, ''[[Mrs. Warren's Profession (film)|Mrs. Warren's Profession]]'', starred [[Lilli Palmer]].

BBC Television produced a television version first broadcast on 3 October, 1972 on [[BBC2]] under the 'Stage 2' drama strand.&lt;ref&gt;https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/fce706d308d34b28935c4c64df0c7666&lt;/ref&gt; Produced by [[Cedric Messina]] and directed by [[Herbert Wise]], it starred [[Coral Browne]] in the title role, with [[Penelope Wilton]] as Vivie. Also in the cast were [[James Grout]], [[Robert Powell]], [[Richard Pearson (actor)|Richard Pearson]] and [[Derek Godfrey]]. Under the ''[[Play of the Month]]'' strand, the production was repeated on [[BBC1]] on 21 April, 1974&lt;ref&gt;https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/66c1ecd4a77a4700ace420bc4b92aad1&lt;/ref&gt;. The production was released on DVD in 2006.

A radio adaptation was broadcast on the [[BBC]] in 2002, and re-broadcast in January 2009 on [[BBC Radio 7]], starring [[Maggie Steed]] in the title role.

==Vivie's character and the changing role of women==

Men who could afford to get married in the Victorian era could make use of “laws that gave him total control of his wife's person—and her fortune”.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence, Dan H. "Victorians Unveiled: Some Thoughts on Mrs. Warren’s Profession". Shaw: The Annual of Bernard Shaw Studies 24 (2004): 40. Retrieved 2010-03-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Victorian women were expected to maintain a poised and dignified manner, and to obey their husbands. Vivie defies the Victorian expectations of an obedient woman: she is educated and entirely self-sufficient. She rejects two marriage proposals, reflecting her reliance on her work ethic and hard-headed approach to life. Shaw represents Vivie as the product of a type of gender reformation: a character who is asexual and "permanently unromantic".&lt;ref&gt;"Mrs. Warren's Profession", ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Twentieth Century and Beyond'' (eds. Joseph Black, et al.) Canada: Broadview, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the play, the boundary between sexual desires and proposed marriages is blurred. Frank flirts with both Mrs. Warren and Vivie; Mrs. Warren's companion Sir George Crofts proposes marriage to Vivie despite his relationship with her mother. Critic Petra Dierkes-Thrun argues that these examples illustrate the way in which Shaw "critiqued the ideological and economic system that produced her [Mrs. Warren], attacking the problematic double standard of [[male privilege]] and the deeply entrenched objectification of women, which Shaw saw pervading all levels of Victorian society down to its most basic nuclear element, the family."&lt;ref&gt;[http://z3950.muse.jhu.edu/journals/english_literature_in_transition/related/v049/49.3.dierkes-thrun.html Dierkes-Thrun, Petra]. ''English Literature in Transition, 1880–1920'', Volume 49, Number 3, 2006, pp. 293–310 (Article)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mulaney''''' is an American [[sitcom]] that aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] from October 5, 2014 to February 15, 2015. Stand-up comedian and former ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' writer [[John Mulaney]] created the show and starred as a fictionalized version of himself. At the beginning of each episode, and sometimes throughout, Mulaney would perform [[stand-up comedy]] to the studio audience. The show suffered from low ratings and poor critical reviews, and was cancelled in March 2015.&lt;ref name=DeadlineCanceled&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andreeva|first1=Nellie|title=Dana Walden Talks ‘New Girl’ &amp; ‘The Mindy Project’ Future, Fox’s Scheduling Needs|url=http://deadline.com/2015/01/new-girl-mindy-project-future-scheduling-fox-dana-walden-1201352538/|website=Deadline|accessdate=April 11, 2015|date=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series premiered October 5, 2014.

On October 18, 2014, the day before the third episode was supposed to air, Fox announced it was cutting three episodes from its order. This resulted in the production of ''Mulaney'' being shut down, as the thirteenth episode had already been filmed and production of the fourteenth was about to begin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/10/mulaney-order-cut-13-episodes-fox-854490/|title=‘Mulaney’ Order Trimmed To 13 Episodes|author=Nellie Andreeva|work=Deadline}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Less than a month later, Fox moved ''Mulaney'' into the 7:30 PM timeslot where ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' had been airing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rockwell |first=Sledge |url=http://uproxx.com/tv/fox-decides-to-switch-mulaney-and-bobs-burgers-on-sunday-nights/ |title=Fox Decides To Switch ‘Mulaney’ And ‘Bob’s Burgers’ On Sunday Nights |publisher=Uproxx.com |date=2014-11-11 |accessdate=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season ended on February 15, 2015 and Fox announced ''Mulaney''{{'}}s cancellation shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/mulaney-cancelled-by-fox-no-season-two-35846/ |title=Mulaney: Cancelled by FOX, no season 2 |publisher=Tvseriesfinale.com |date=2015-02-28 |accessdate=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{quote box|quote=I look back on making the show really fondly. It's my noble failure. I tried, and I wanted to do it this way. Some people liked it—just not enough.|align=right|width=300px|source=John Mulaney, ''New Times''&lt;ref&gt;Pfeffer, Ryan (May 1, 2015). [http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/arts/with-no-more-distractions-john-mulaney-returns-to-stand-up-6945958 "WITH NO MORE DISTRACTIONS, JOHN MULANEY RETURNS TO STAND UP"]. ''New Times''. Retrieved June 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Even before ''Mulaney'' aired, critics were wary of the direction of the show.  After viewing the show's trailer, Eric Dodds with ''TIME'' magazine penned an article called, "8 Ways the Trailer for ''Mulaney'' Resembles ''Seinfeld''," and said it could "trigger a little déjà vu."&lt;ref name=dodds/&gt;  In regard to its [[multi-camera]] format, Canadian magazine ''Maclean's'' asked, "why would a cool comic pick such an uncool format?"&lt;ref name=seinfeld&gt;Weinman, Jaime J. (August 4, 2014), "'The New Seinfeld'".  ''Maclean's''. '''127''' (30/31):60-62&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the show was universally panned by critics, with most reviews drawing unflattering comparisons to ''Seinfeld''. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the show has an approval rating of 17% based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 4.3/10. The site's critical consensus states, "John Mulaney, we know [[Jerry Seinfeld]]. ''Seinfeld'' was funny. ''Mulaney'', you're no ''Seinfeld''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/mulaney/s01|title=Mulaney: Season 1|date=October 5, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the series has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/mulaney|title=Mulaney|work=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Poniewozik]] with ''TIME'' magazine said the show "seems like something a dutiful student might have produced for his final project in his 'Tropes and Themes in the 1990s Sitcom' class."&lt;ref&gt;Poniewozik, James (October 3, 2014), "Review: Mulaney Does Its Homework Too Well." ''TIME''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert Bianco with ''[[USA Today]]'' called the sitcom a "misfire."&lt;ref&gt;Bianco, Robert (October 3, 2014), "Fox's ‘Mulaney' is a misfire of a sitcom". ''USA Today''.&lt;/ref&gt; The show was named the fourth-worst show of 2014 by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20326356_20879083,00.html#30260950|title=5 Worst TV Shows of 2014|work=EW.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mulaney'' fared poorly commercially as well, with the series premiere only getting 2.3 million viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/10/07/sunday-final-ratings-once-upon-a-time-resurrection-madam-secretary-adjusted-down/311599/|title=Sunday Final Ratings: ‘Once Upon a Time’, ‘Resurrection’ &amp; ‘Revenge’ Adjusted Up; ‘Madam Secretary’ Adjusted Down|work=TVbytheNumbers|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the  weakest scores for any of the fall's series premieres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/data/ratings/foxs-mulaney-off-to-weak-start-sunday-once-strong-madam-secretary-rises-1201322395/|title=‘Mulaney’ Ratings Weak in Premiere; ‘Once Upon a Time’ Ratings Strong|work=Variety|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The episode from December 21, 2014, became the lowest rated episode, with fewer than 1 million views; the January 18, 2015 episode, airing after the [[2014–15 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship Game: Seattle Seahawks 28, Green Bay Packers 22 (OT)|NFC Championship Game]], became the highest-rated, with over 3 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/mulaney-season-one-ratings-34246/|title=Mulaney TV show on FOX: latest ratings (cancel or renew?)|publisher=TV Series Finale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:National-arts-club.jpg|thumb|right|325px|The club's headquarters at 15 [[Gramercy Park]] South, the former [[Samuel J. Tilden House]] (May 2007)]] 

The '''National Arts Club''' is a private club on [[Gramercy Park]], [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. It was founded in 1898 by [[Charles DeKay]], an art and literary critic of the ''[[New York Times]]'' to "stimulate, foster, and promote public interest in the arts and to educate the American people in the fine arts".  Since 1906 the organization has occupied the [[Samuel J. Tilden House]], a landmarked [[Gothic Revival architecture|Victorian Gothic Revival]]&lt;ref name=desrep&gt;[http://www.neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/THE-NATIONAL-ARTS-CLUB.pdf "National Arts Club Designation Report"] [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] (March 15, 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; [[brownstone]] at 15 Gramercy Park, next door to [[The Players (New York City)|The Players]], a club with similar interests. The National Arts Club is noted for allowing members access to a [[Gramercy Park#Key|Gramercy Park key]].

The National Arts Club  has several art galleries, and hosts a variety of outstanding programs in all artistic areas including theater, literature and music. Although the club is private, many of these frequent events are free and open to the public. 

The club's mansion headquarters was designated a [[New York City landmark]] in 1966,&lt;ref name=nycland&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; and declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1647&amp;ResourceType=Building|title=Samuel J.

==History==
A group of friends, all of them involved in architecture, art, or civic affairs, discussed the possibility of a new kind of club that would embrace all the arts. The establishment of the Club came at a time when American artists were increasingly turning to their own nation rather than exclusively to Europe as a center of work and creativity. Significantly, the Club would offer full membership for women at the onset, reflecting their accomplishment in the arts.

While the group was working out an organizational plan, [[Charles DeKay]], the literary and art critic of the ''[[New York Times]]'' for 18 years, returned from a diplomatic post abroad. An inspired organizer and entrepreneur, he sent letters to men and women of importance in the New York area as well as in metropolitan areas across the country. The response was so enthusiastic that the Club was able to apply to Albany for its charter in 1898. With the application went a list of the officers, Board of Trustees, and members totaling more than 1200.

The list included such collectors as [[Henry Frick]], [[William T. Evans]], Benjamin Altman, [[Jules Bache]] and [[Henry Walters]]. Though not a charter member, [[J. Pierpont Morgan]] joined the Club early in its development and later was made an Honorary Vice President. Among the artists of the period, earlier charter members, or those joined in the early days of the Club were [[Frederic Remington]], [[William Merritt Chase]], [[Robert Henri]] and [[George Bellows]].

The Club's first home was a brownstone on West 34th Street. Commerce, meanwhile, was moving up from downtown, and the neighborhood of brownstones was changing. [[Spencer Trask]], its treasurer, was asked to find the Club a new home. He found that 14 and 15 Gramercy Park South, the former home of Samuel Tilden, was on the market. Legend has it that he was so afraid that some other buyer would also find it that he put down some money of his own to bind the bargain. In 1906, the Club acquired the [[Samuel J. Tilden House]].

Since the Summer 2006, the Mansion's stoop at 14 Gramercy Park has been under restoration. Recently, New York artist [[Sergio Rossetti Morosini]] sculpted a bust of [[Michelangelo]] for its façade.

==Controversy==
The president of the club from 1985 to 2011 was O. Aldon James.&lt;ref name="nyt-20010125"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2012, an 18-month investigation into the final five years of James' presidency by [[New York State Attorney General]] [[Eric T. Schneiderman]] resulted in a $2 million lawsuit against James by the state, charging that he misused the club's funds and real estate for his own benefit.  The state charges that James used his control of the club to take over numerous real estate units under its auspices, and that he and his twin brother hoarded clothes, antiques and other valuable artifacts until their rooms could no longer be lived in.  According to the state, since 2006, James' activities cost the club $1.5 million in lost rentals, as well as a quarter of a million dollars the club provided for James' opulent lifestyle.  James also fraudulently used money from a fellowship fund to pay for repairs to the club's facade.  The state's complaint against James was near to a settlement in July 2012, until James rejected it. James also has two lawsuits of his own outstanding against the club.&lt;ref name=nytsep12&gt;Leland, John. [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/22/nyregion/state-sues-ousted-national-arts-club-leader-o-aldon-james-jr.html "Attorney General Sues Club’s Ex-Leader for $2 Million, Citing Misuse of Its Money"] ''[[New York Times]]'' (September 21, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The state's investigation also resulted in agreements with the club for reforms, such as term limits on officers and board members, as well as changes in some of its real estate practices.  In addition the current president of the club, painter and philanthropist Dianne Bernhard, who took office in June 2011 when James was ousted, agreed to step down and leave the board once her term was up.&lt;ref name=nytsep12 /&gt;

The [[intellectual property]] rights on [[photograph]]s are protected in different [[jurisdiction]]s by the laws governing [[copyright]] and [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]]. In some cases photography may be restricted by civil or criminal law. Publishing certain photographs can be restricted by [[Privacy law|privacy]] or other laws. Photography can be generally restricted in the interests of [[public morality]] and the [[Child protection|protection of children]].

Reactions to photography differ between societies, and even where there are no official restrictions there may be objections to photographing people or places. Reactions may range from complaints to violence for photography which is not illegal.

===Legal restrictions on photography===

[[File:Mass photo gathering uk 2.jpg|thumb|Mass photo gathering in UK.]]
In the United Kingdom there are no laws forbidding photography of private property from a public place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.urban75.org/photos/photographers-rights-and-the-law.html|title=Photographers Rights And The Law In The UK - the law and photography|website=www.urban75.org|access-date=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photography on private land is not restricted if the landowner has given permission.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} However, landowners are permitted to impose any conditions they wish upon entry to a property, including forbidding or restricting photography.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Two public locations in the UK, [[Trafalgar Square]] and [[Parliament Square]], have a specific provision against photography for commercial purposes without the written permission of the [[Mayor of London|Mayor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/trafalgar_square_byelaws.pdf|title=Trafalgar Square Byelaws 2012|year=2012|work=Greater London Authority Act 1999, Section 385(1)|publisher=Greater London Authority |accessdate=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/parliament_square_gardens_byelaws.pdf|title=Parliament Square Garden Byelaws 2012|publisher=Greater London Authority|accessdate=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Squares' Management Team and paying a fee,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/art-culture/trafalgar-square/managing-trafalgar-square/filming-trafalgar-square/application-process Application process&lt;/ref&gt; and permission is needed to photograph or film for commercial purposes in the [[Royal Parks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/park-management/licences-and-permits/filming-in-the-royal-parks|title=Commercial filming and photography|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=The Royal Parks|via=|accessdate=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persistent or aggressive photography of a single individual may come under the legal definition of [[harassment]].&lt;ref&gt;''Linda Macpherson LL.B, Dip.L.P., LL.M'' – [http://www.sirimo.co.uk/ukpr.php The UK Photographers Rights Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is [[contempt of court]], a criminal offence, to take a photograph in any [[court of law]] of any person, being a judge of the court or a juror or a witness in or a party to any proceedings before the court, whether civil or criminal, or to publish such a photograph. This includes photographs taken in a court building or the precincts of the court.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Justice Act 1925 (c.86) s.41&lt;/ref&gt;
Taking a photograph in a court can be seen as a serious offence, leading to a prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Mobile court photo sentence upheld – [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/3686557.stm news.bbc.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Regina v Vincent D No. 2004/01739/A7 [2004] EWCA Crim 1271&lt;/ref&gt; The prohibition on taking photographs in the precincts is vague. It was designed to prevent the undermining of the dignity of the court, through the exploitation of images in low brow "picture papers".&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, G. "Seddon, Dell and rock n' roll: investigating alleged breaches of the ban on publishing photographs taken within courts or their precincts, 1925–1967" Crim. L.R. 874&lt;/ref&gt;

Photography of certain subject matter is restricted in the United Kingdom. In particular, the [[Protection of Children Act 1978]] restricts making or possessing pornography of children under 18, or what looks like pornography of under-18s. There is no law prohibiting photographing children in public spaces.

It is an offence under the [[Counter-Terrorism Act 2008]] to publish or communicate a photograph of a [[constable]] (not including [[Police Community Support Officer|PCSOs]]), a member of the armed forces, or a member of the security services, which is of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. There is a defence of acting with a reasonable excuse; however, the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] is on the defence, under section 58A of the [[Terrorism Act 2000]]. A PCSO in 2009 cited [[Terrorism Act 2000#Section 44 powers (stop and search)|Section 44]] of the Terrorism Act 2000 to prevent a member of the public photographing him. Section 44 actually concerns stop and search powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.enfieldindependent.co.uk/news/4289832.Man_questioned_under_terrorism_law_after_taking_picture_of_police_car_in_park/|title=Man questioned under terrorism law after taking picture of police car in park|last=Cosgrove|first=Sarah|date=14 April 2009|work=Enfield Independent|accessdate=2009-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in January 2010 the stop-and-search powers granted under Section 44 were ruled illegal by the [[European Court of Human Rights]].

Following a prolonged campaign, including a series of demonstrations by photographers dealt with by police officers and PCSOs,  the Metropolitan Police was forced to issue updated legal advice which confirms that "Members of the public and the media do not need a permit to film or photograph in public places and police have no power to stop them filming or photographing incidents or police personnel" and that "The power to stop and search someone under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 no longer exists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.met.police.uk/advice-and-information/photography-advice/ |title=Photography advice|website=Metropolitan Police Service |date=  |author= |accessdate= 10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an offence under section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000 to take a photograph of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, or possessing such a photograph. There is an identical defence of reasonable excuse. This offence (and possibly, but not necessarily the {{nowrap|s. 58(a)}} offence) covers only a photograph as described in {{nowrap|s. 2(3)(b)}} of the [[Terrorism Act 2006]]. As such, it must be of a kind likely to provide practical assistance to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. Whether the photograph in question is such is a matter for a jury, which is not required to look at the surrounding circumstances. The photograph must contain information of such a nature as to raise a reasonable suspicion that it was intended to be used to assist in the preparation or commission of an act of terrorism. It must call for an explanation. A photograph which is innocuous on its face will not fall foul of the provision if the prosecution adduces evidence that it was intended to be used for the purpose of committing or preparing a terrorist act. The defence may prove a reasonable excuse simply by showing that the photograph is possessed for a purpose other than to assist in the commission or preparation of an act of terrorism, even if the purpose of possession is otherwise unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;R v K [2008] EWCA Crim 185&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright===

[[Copyright]] can subsist in an original photograph, i.e. a recording of light or other radiation on any medium on which an image is produced or from which an image by any means be produced, and which is not part of a film.&lt;ref name="CDPAs1"&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 1(1)(a) and s 4(2)&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst photographs are classified as artistic works, the subsistence of copyright does not depend on artistic merit.&lt;ref name="CDPAs1"/&gt; The owner of the copyright in the photograph is the photographer – the person who creates it,&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 9(1)&lt;/ref&gt; by default.&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 11(1)&lt;/ref&gt; However, where a photograph is taken by an employee [[Work for hire|in the course of employment]], the first owner of the copyright is the employer, unless there is an agreement to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 11(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyright which subsists in a photograph protects not merely the photographer from direct copying of his/her work, but also from indirect copying to reproduce his/her work, where a substantial part of his/her work has been copied.

Copyright in a photograph lasts for 70 years from the end of the year in which the photographer dies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 12&lt;/ref&gt; A consequence of this lengthy period of existence of the copyright is that many family photographs which have no market value, but significant emotional value, remain subject to copyright, even when the original photographer cannot be traced (a problem known as [[copyright orphan]]), has given up photography, or died. In the absence of a licence, it will be an infringement of copyright in the photographs to copy them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 16(2)&lt;/ref&gt; When someone dies the rights will have transferred to someone else, perhaps through testamentary deposition (a will) or by inheritance. If there was no will, or if the photographer has not specified where the rights in the material should go, then the normal rules of inheritance will apply (although these rules are not specific to copyright and legal advice should be sought).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/copy/c-other/c-locating.htm| title=Locating a copyright owner| publisher=Intellectual Property Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scanning old family photographs, without permission, to a digital file for personal use is prima facie an infringement of copyright.

Certain photographs may not be protected by copyright. Section 171(3) of the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] gives courts jurisdiction to refrain from enforcing the copyright which subsists in works on the grounds of public interest. For example, [[patent]] diagrams are held to be in the [[public domain]], and are thus not subject to copyright.

====Infringement====
[[File:No photographs stickers.png|thumb|right|220px|"No photographs" sticker. Designed for persons at conferences who do not want any digital likeness of them taken, including video, photography, audio, etc.]]
Infringement of the copyright which subsists in a photograph can be performed through copying the photograph. This is because the owner of the copyright in the photograph has the exclusive right to copy the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 16(1)&lt;/ref&gt; For there to be infringement of the copyright in a photograph, there must be copying of a substantial part of the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s16(3)&lt;/ref&gt;
A photograph can also be a mechanism of infringement of the copyright which subsists in another work. For example, a photograph which copies a substantial part of an artistic work, such as a sculpture, painting or another photograph (without permission) would infringe the copyright which subsists in those works.

However, the subject matter of a photograph is not necessarily subject to an independent copyright. For example, in the Creation Records case,&lt;ref&gt;Creation Records Ltd v News Group Newspapers Ltd [1997] EMLR 444 (Ch)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipit-update.com/copy21.htm|title=Case Note: Creation Records Ltd. v News Group Newspapers|last=Lambert|first=Jane|date=February 2000|work=IP/IT-Update|publisher=NIPC|accessdate=2009-05-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201133421/http://www.ipit-update.com/copy21.htm|archivedate=2008-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a photographer, attempting to create a photograph for an album cover, set up an elaborate and artificial scene. A photographer from a newspaper covertly photographed the scene and published it in the newspaper. The court held that the newspaper photographer did not infringe the official photographer's copyright. Copyright did not subsist in the scene itself – it was too temporary to be a collage, and could not be categorised as any other form of artistic work.

Richard Arnold has criticized the protection of photographs in this manner on two grounds.&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;Richard Arnold, “Copyright in Photographs: A Case for Reform” [2005] [[European Intellectual Property Review]] 303&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, it is argued that photographs should not be protected as artistic works, but should instead be protected in a manner similar to that of sound recordings and films. In other words, copyright should not protect the subject matter of a photograph as a matter of course as a consequence of a photograph being taken.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Illustrated in the [http://www.ipit-update.com/copy50.htm Norowzian v Arks case]. In this case, it was noted that the copyright in a film would be infringed only though photographic copying of a substantial part, as opposed to mere recreation of the film. It was, however, also held that a film could be protected by copyright both as a film and as a dramatic work, provided, of course, that it fulfilled the requirements of protection of a dramatic work, on the facts. The claimant, was eventually unsuccessful. It was held that whilst the film in question in fact had copyright subsist in it both as a film and as a dramatic work, this copyright was not infringed, because there was no copying of a substantial part.&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that protection of photographs as artistic works is anomalous, in that photography is ultimately a medium of reproduction, rather than creation. As such, it is more similar to a film, or sound recording than a painting or sculpture. Some photographers share this view. For example, [[Michael Reichmann]] described photography as an art of disclosure, as opposed to an art of inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-first=Michael |author-last=Reichmann |author-link=Michael Reichmann |url=http://www.luminous-landscape.com/essays/theartof.shtml |title=The Art of Photography |publisher=The Luminous Landscape |accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, it is argued that the protection of photographs as artistic works leads to bizarre results.&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt; Subject matter is protected irrespective of the artistic merit of a photograph. The subject matter of a photograph is protected even when it is not deserving of protection. For copyright to subsist in photographs as artistic works, the photographs must be original, since the English test for originality is based on skill, labour and judgment.&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt; That said, it is possible that the threshold of originality is very low. Essentially, by this, Arnold is arguing that whilst the subject matter of some photographs may deserve protection, it is inappropriate for the law to presume that the subject matter of all photographs is deserving of protection.

It is possible to say with a high degree of confidence that photographs of three-dimensional objects, including artistic works, will be treated by a court as themselves original artistic works, and as such, will be subject to copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out-law.com/page-8688|title=Antiquesportfolio.com plc v Rodney Fitch &amp; Co Ltd|publisher=Pinsent Masons|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that a photograph (including a scan – digital scanning counts as photography for the purposes of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988) of a two dimensional artistic work, such as another photograph or a painting will also be subject to copyright if a significant amount of skill, labour and judgment went into its creation.&lt;ref&gt;See Sawkins v Hyperion Records [2005] EWCA Civ 565 at [79]-[84]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photography and privacy===

A [[right to privacy]] came into existence in UK law as a consequence of the incorporation of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] into domestic law through the [[Human Rights Act 1998]]. This can result in restrictions on the publication of photography.&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Act 1998]] sections 2 &amp; 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Act 1998]] Schedule 1, Part 1, Article 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mosley v News Group Newspapers Ltd [2008] EWHC 1777 (QB)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell v Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd [2004] UKHL 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murray v Express Newspapers Plc [2008] EWCA Civ 446&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether this right is caused by horizontal effect of the Human Rights Act 1998 or is judicially created is a matter of some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;J. Morgan, "Privacy in the House of Lords, Again" (2004), 120 ''Law Quarterly Review'' 563, 565&lt;/ref&gt; The right to privacy is protected by Article 8 of the convention. In the context of photography, it stands at odds to the Article 10 right of freedom of expression. As such, courts will consider the public interest in balancing the rights through the legal test of proportionality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A very limited statutory right to privacy exists in the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]. This right is held, for example, by someone who hires a photographer to photograph their wedding. The commissioner,&lt;ref name="CDPAs2"&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 2&lt;/ref&gt; irrespective of any copyright which he does or does not hold in the photograph,&lt;ref name="CDPAs2"/&gt; of a photograph which was commissioned for private and domestic purposes, where copyright subsists in the photograph, has the right not to have copies of the work issued to the public,&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 85(1)a&lt;/ref&gt; the work exhibited in public&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 85(1)a Paragraph B&lt;/ref&gt; or the work communicated to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 85(1)a Paragraph C&lt;/ref&gt; However, this right will not be infringed if the rightholder gives permission. It will not be infringed if the photograph is incidentally included in an artistic work, film, or broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 85(2)(a)&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

Local, state, and national laws govern still and motion photography. Laws vary between jurisdictions, and what is not illegal in one place may be illegal in another. Typical laws in the United States are as follows:

===Public property===
[[File:Museum photography.jpg|thumb|Some [[museum]]s do not allow [[photography]].]]
*It is legal to photograph or videotape anything and anyone on any public property, within reasonable community standards.&lt;ref name="krages_photo_rights"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.krages.com/ThePhotographersRight.pdf |title=The Photographer's Right |author=Krages II, Bert P |accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Photographing or videotaping a tourist attraction, whether publicly or privately owned, is generally considered legal, unless explicitly prohibited by a specific law or statute.

===Private property===
*Photography may be prohibited or restricted by a property owner on their property.&lt;ref name="krages_photo_rights" /&gt; However, a property owner generally cannot restrict the photographing of the property by individuals who are not within the bounds of the property.&lt;ref name="krages_photo_rights" /&gt;
*Photography on private property that is generally open to the public (e.g., a shopping mall) is usually permitted unless explicitly prohibited by posted signs. Even if no such signs are posted, the property owner or agent can ask a person to stop photographing, and if the person refuses to do so, the owner or agent can ask the person to leave; in some jurisdictions, a person who refuses to leave can be arrested for criminal trespass, and many jurisdictions recognize the common-law right to use reasonable force to remove a trespasser; a person who forcibly resists a lawful removal may be liable for battery, assault, or both.&lt;ref name="krages_legal_handbook"&gt;{{cite book |last = Krages | first= Bert P. |title = Legal Handbook for Photographers|url = http://www.krages.com/bpkphoto.htm|accessdate = 2011-06-21|edition = 2nd|year = 2007| publisher = Amherst Media| location  = Buffalo, NY|isbn = 978-1-58428-194-8}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
*Entry onto private property not normally open to the public usually requires permission from the property owner.
*Some jurisdictions have laws regarding filming while in a hospital or health care facility. Where permitted, such filming may be useful in gathering evidence in cases of abuse, neglect, or malpractice.
===Outer Space===
*Remote sensing of the earth from outer space is regulated by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] which requires that a license be issued in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/CRSRA/licenseHome.html |title=Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-03-23 |website=The NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) |publisher=NOAA |access-date=2018-03-31 |quote= It is unlawful for any person who is subject to the jurisdiction or control of the United States, directly or through any subsidiary or affiliate to operate a private remote sensing space system without possession of a valid license issued under the Act and the regulations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy issues===
{{Further information|Privacy laws of the United States}}

* Photographing private property from within the public domain is not illegal, with the exception of an area that is generally regarded as private, such as a bedroom, bathroom, or hotel room.&lt;ref name="krages_photo_rights" /&gt;  In some states there is no definition of "private," in which case, there is a general [[expectation of privacy]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  Should the subjects not attempt to conceal their private affairs, their actions immediately become public to a photographer using normal photographic equipment.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
* Many places have laws prohibiting photographing private areas under a person's clothing without that person's permission. This also applies to any filming of another within a public restroom or locker room. Some jurisdictions have banned the use of a telephone with camera functionality within a restroom or locker room in order to prevent this. The United States enacted the Video Voyeurism Prevention Act of 2004 to punish those who intentionally capture an individual's private areas without consent, when the person knew the subject had an expectation of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s108-1301 |title=S. 1301 [108th&amp;#93;: Video Voyeurism Prevention Act of 2004 |publisher=GovTrack.us |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[U.S. state|State]] laws have also been passed addressing this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncvc.org/ncvc/AGP.Net/Components/documentViewer/Download.aspxnz?DocumentID=40459 |title=Video Voyeurism Laws |publisher=The National Center for Victims of Crime |accessdate=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
*If a photograph shows private property in such a manner that a viewer of the photograph can identify the owner of the property, the ASMP (American Society of Media Photographers, Inc.) recommends that a [[property release]] should be used if the photograph is to be used for advertising or commercial purposes.&lt;ref name="asmp_faq1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asmp.org/commerce/legal/releases/FAQ1.php#q5 |title=ASMP: Property and Model Release Tutorial |accessdate=2009-03-09 |publisher=American Society of Media Photographers, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ASMP, a property release may be a requirement in such a situation.&lt;ref name="asmp_faq1"/&gt;

===Other issues===
*Photographing accident scenes and law enforcement activities is usually legal.&lt;ref name="krages_photo_rights" /&gt; At the same time, one must not hinder the operations of law enforcement, medical, emergency, or security personnel by filming.
*Any filming with the intent of doing unlawful harm against a subject may be a violation of the law in itself.

==Canada==
Federal legislation governs the questions of [[copyright]] and criminal offences with respect to photography. Otherwise, the [[common law]] (except, in the case of Quebec, the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]''), generally determines when photography can take place.

:* The ''[[Copyright Act of Canada|Copyright Act]]'' provides that the duration of copyright for a photograph is the life of the author plus 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Copyright Act|abbr =R.S.C.|year =1985|chapter =C-42|section =6|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/section-6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freedom of panorama]] is also allowed, with respect to photographs of sculptures and architectural works,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Copyright Act|abbr =R.S.C.|year =1985|chapter =C-42|section =32.2|subsection=1|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/section-32.2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is also protection for those who "incidentally and not deliberately include a work or other subject-matter in another work or other subject-matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Copyright Act|abbr =R.S.C.|year =1985|chapter =C-42|section =30.7|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/section-30.7.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]'' provides for punishment of various offences, including [[voyeurism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CCC|162}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[child pornography]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CCC|163.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; trespassing at night,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CCC|177}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[paparazzi]] behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CCC|264}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The law of [[defamation]], [[trespass]] and [[privacy]] is governed at the provincial level.
::* The common-law provinces of [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Ontario]] and [[Saskatchewan]] have enacted privacy legislation dealing with [[personality rights]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Conroy| first1=Amy M. |year= 2012 |title= Protecting Your Personality Rights in Canada: A Matter of Property or Privacy? |url= http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/uwojls/vol1/iss1/3/ |journal= Western Journal of Legal Studies |publisher= [[University of Western Ontario]] |volume= 1 |issue= 1 |page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which supplement the law of trespass.
::* In Quebec, the ''Civil Code'' goes further by specifying that "keeping ... private life under observation by any means" constitutes an additional ground of invasion of privacy. In ''[[Aubry v Éditions Vice-Versa Inc]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] held that, because of that, supplemented by Quebec's ''[[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]]'' privacy provisions, a photographer can take photographs in public places but may not publish them unless permission has been obtained from the subject, except where the subject appears in an incidental manner, or whose professional success depends on public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Aubry v Éditions Vice-Versa Inc|link=Aubry v Éditions Vice-Versa Inc|year=1998|court=scc|num=817|format=canlii|pinpoint=par. 55{{en dash}}59|parallelcite=[1998] 1 SCR 591|date=1998-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In private property, photography may be prohibited or restricted by a property owner on their property.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Photography on private property that is generally open to the public (e.g., a shopping mall) is usually permitted unless explicitly prohibited by posted signs. Even if no such signs are posted, the property owner or agent can ask a person to stop photographing, and if the person refuses to do so, the owner or agent can ask the person to leave; in some jurisdictions, a person who refuses to leave can be arrested for criminal trespass, and many jurisdictions recognize the common-law right to use reasonable force to remove a trespasser; a person who forcibly resists a lawful removal may be liable for battery, assault, or both.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Hungary==

In Hungary, from 15 March 2014 when the long-awaited Civil Code was published, the law re-stated what had been normal practice, namely, that a person had the right to refuse being photographed. However, [[implied consent]] exists: it is not illegal to photograph a person who does not actively object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xpatloop.com/news/xpat_opinion_whats_up_with_the_new_civil_code_and_press_photographs|title=Xpat Opinion: What’s Up With The New Civil Code &amp; Press Photographs? - Xpatloop.com - Expat Life In Budapest, Hungary - Current affairs|website=www.xpatloop.com|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/14/hungary-law-photography-permission-take-pictures | date = 14 March 2014 | accessdate = 20 May 2014 | first = Daniel | last = Nolan | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | location = London | title = Hungary law requires photographers to ask permission to take pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macau==
In Macau, a photographer must not take or publish any photographs of a person against his/her will without legal justification, even in a public place. Besides, everyone has a right to Personality Rights.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} People are not to be photographed, photographs of them displayed or reproduced without their prior consent.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Criminal penalties include imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pj.gov.mo/NEW/Q8_ans02.htm|title="不法進行錄音錄像"|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, photography of police officers in Macau is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/realtime/news/20151206/54508142|title=澳門女子上載遭抄牌片 發帖罵警被判囚1年|website=Apple Daily 蘋果日報|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Africa==
In [[South Africa]] photographing people in public is legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burchell|first=Jonathan|year=2009|title=The Legal Protection of Privacy in South Africa: A Transplantable Hybrid|url=https://www.ejcl.org//131/art131-2.pdf|journal=Electronic Journal of Comparative Law|volume=13.1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproducing and selling photographs of people is legal for editorial and limited fair use commercial purposes. There exists no case law to define what the limits on commercial use are. Civil law requires the consent of any identifiable persons for advertorial and promotional purposes. Property, including animals, do not enjoy any special consideration.

During the media coverage of the [[Nkandla (homestead)|Nkandla]] controversy it emerged that there exists a law, the [[National Key Points Act, 1980]], prohibiting the photographing of any "national key points." National key points are buildings or structures that serve a strategic or military purpose. Though it wasn't revealed what these are as part of state secrecy it was claimed that the presidential residence is one of them and should thus not be shown in media. Subsequent court action resulted in it being ruled that a list of all key points be made public. Although not currently or previously enforced the law is still in effect even after calls for it to be repealed as a relic of apartheid-era secrecy legislation.

==Sudan and South Sudan==
Travelers who wish to take any photographs must obtain a photography permit from the Ministry of Interior, Department of Aliens (Sudan)&lt;ref&gt;[https://sudan.usembassy.gov/information_for_travelers.html "Information for Travelers: Visiting Sudan"] U.S. Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt; or Ministry of Information (South Sudan).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/south-sudan/local-laws-and-customs "Foreign travel advice: South Sudan"] Government of the United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
Regulations apply to land-based photography for certain locations. A permit is required for aerial photography in India, which normally takes over a month to be issued.&lt;ref name="ri"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reelindiapictures.com/permit-process.html |title=Reel India Pictures |publisher=www.reelindiapictures.com |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iceland==
Calling oneself a photographer, in line with most other trades in Iceland, requires the person to hold a Journeyman's or Master's Certificates in the industry. Exceptions can be made in low population areas, or for people coming from within the EEA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://eng.atvinnuvegaraduneyti.is/laws-and-regulations/nr/nr/7350 "Information for Tradesmen and Others"] Ministry of Industries and Innovation. Accessed 27 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
Taking pictures of police officers in many circumstances was made illegal by a 2015 "Citizens' Security Law" with the stated purpose of protecting police officers and their families from harassment. The law has generated controversy because it may be harder to denounce police brutality. A far more limited version of the law had been in effect for several decades regarding when police work related to terrorism. A person was fined under this law for taking and publishing online a photograph of an illegally parked police car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3200903/Spanish-woman-took-picture-police-car-parked-disabled-bay-fined-nearly-600-controversial-new-gagging-law.html |title=Spanish woman who took picture of police car parked in disabled bay is fined nearly £600 under controversial new 'gagging law' |newspaper=Daily Mail |date= 17 August 2015 |author=Julian Robinson|accessdate= 10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexico==
Mexican law is similar to the law in the United States. Authorities may intimidate or prevent any holder of a camera if they come into close perimeters of Government buildings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==South Korea==

In South Korea, taking pictures of women without their consent, even in public, is considered to be criminal [[sexual assault]], punishable by a fine of under 10 million [[South Korean won|won]] and up to 5 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.go.kr/%EB%B2%95%EB%A0%B9/%EC%84%B1%ED%8F%AD%EB%A0%A5%EB%B2%94%EC%A3%84%EC%9D%98%20%EC%B2%98%EB%B2%8C%20%EB%93%B1%EC%97%90%20%EA%B4%80%ED%95%9C%20%ED%8A%B9%EB%A1%80%EB%B2%95|title="South Korean law on criminal sexual assault, Chapter 1 Article 14"|author=|date=|website=law.go.kr}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Not specifically in source|date=July 2018}} In July 2017 an amendment to the law was voted on in favour of allowing for chemical castration of people taking such photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edaily.co.kr/news/NewsRead.edy?newsid=01298886615999112&amp;SCD=JG31&amp;DCD=A00703|title=`몰카 찰칵했다간 철컹`…몰카범도 화학적 거세한다|first1=Ⓒ 종합 경제정보 미디어 이데일리-상업적|last1=무단전재|first2=재배포|last2=금지|date=28 July 2017|website=edaily|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''property master''', often called the '''prop(s) master''', is an [[artistic]] and organizational employee in a [[film]], [[television]] or [[theatrical]] production who is responsible for purchasing, acquiring, manufacturing, properly placing, and/or overseeing any [[Theatrical property|prop]]s needed for a production. The property master also works with other members of the production managing the physical appearance of the [[Stage_(theatre)|stage]] or [[Film_set|set]], for example they might work with the [[script supervisor]] to maintain set [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]]. The property master is on staff during preproduction, develops the stylistic concept of the physical production, then continues on as a member of the physical shooting/production crew.&lt;ref&gt;[https://theatre.barnard.edu/sites/default/files/inline/props_master_0.pdf barnard.edu, Barnard College Department of Theatre, Production Crew Job Descriptions]&lt;/ref&gt; A person responsible for purchasing the props can be called a '''props buyer''' or '''production buyer'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/articles/art20130702112135897 Profile: props buyer – BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;

During preproduction, the props master develops a props breakdown. This is essentially mapping out the logical progression of each prop throughout the story. During shooting, the props master maintains the logical progression by ensuring the props are positioned in their correct logical place for each scene according to the props breakdown. If the logical progression of a prop changes during shooting, the props breakdown is revised to reflect the change.&lt;ref&gt;http://filmtvcareers.about.com/od/basics/p/CP_PropMaster.htm 
Prop Master, By Phil Breman, Film/TV Careers Expert&lt;/ref&gt;

This job description varies somewhat from country to country. In the United States, [[food styling]], weapons and animals are often directly or indirectly within the property master's domain.

The job is a collaboration with the [[Film director|director]], [[production designer]], [[cameraman]], [[set decorator]] and other members of the production to physically express their stylistic and [[aesthetic]] requirements. They maintain their own budget. There are physical aspects of productions that are managed by specialists other than the property master, for example [[costume designer]]s are responsible for the actors' dress, and [[weapons master]]s are responsible for any weapons (firearms, blades, staff-based or otherwise).

In professional theatre, the property master is responsible for the setup and organization of the props.
Property master is directed by the director.

The '''Queen's Theatre, Dublin''', located in [[Pearse Street, Dublin|Pearse Street]] was originally built in 1829 as the '''Adelphi Theatre'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finegan|first1=John|title=Dublin's Lost Theatres|journal=Dublin Historical Record|date=1994|volume=47|issue=1|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; This building was demolished in 1844 and rebuilt. It reopened that same year as the '''Queens Royal Theatre''',&lt;ref name=Kerins&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kerins|first1=Des|title=The Queen's Theatre|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Dublin/QueensTheatreDublin.htm|website=arthurlloyd.co.uk|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the new owner having been granted a Royal [[Letters Patent|Patent]] to operate as a [[patent theatre]]. The theatre quickly became known as simply the Queen's. It was most famous in the 20th century as  the home of the Happy Gang, a troupe of comics, singers and musicians including [[Danny Cummins]], Jimmy Harvey, Mick Eustace and [[Cecil Nash]]. The regular members of the "gang" took part in sketches as required, but in addition each had to be a solo performer in his own right.
The [[Abbey Theatre]] took over the building after the Abbey fire of 1951 and remained until 1966. The theatre closed in 1969 and was demolished in 1975.

[[File:Renier de Huy MCL1.jpg|thumb|300px|Another view of the font]]

'''Renier de Huy''' (or '''Rainer of Huy''') (also Reiner, van, etc. in any combination) was a 12th-century metalworker and sculptor to whom is attributed a major masterpiece of [[Mosan art]], the [[baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège]] in [[Liège (city)|Liege]], [[Belgium]] of 1107–18.&lt;ref&gt;Swarzenski, 58, Calkins, 125&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Meuse River]] valley in modern Belgium and France, roughly comprising the [[Diocese of Liège]], was the leading 12th century centre of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque metalwork]], which was still the most prestigious medium in art.  Nothing is known of Rainer's life other than that a "Reinerus aurifaber" witnessed a [[charter]] of the Bishop of Liège relating to a church in [[Huy]] in 1125, but the 15th century Liège [[chronicle]] mentions him as the artist of the font.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 182 (other sources, such as Oxford, say the mention was 14th not 15th century)&lt;/ref&gt;  He may have died about 1150.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 178. The Getty Union Artist Names List has him active until 1144 [http://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=Rainer+of+Huy&amp;role=&amp;nation=&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=500081355]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another equally shadowy figure in Mosan metalwork from the next generation, [[Godefroid de Huy]]/de Claire, also came from the small but prosperous city of Huy on the Meuse.

The only other work generally agreed to be by the same master as the font is a small bronze [[crucifix]] figure ([[Schnütgen Museum]], [[Cologne]]); another in [[Brussels]] is probably from the same mould, with extra chasing.  Others in Brussels and [[Dublin]] are probably from the workshop as they have many similarities.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 181, and plate 182 for the Cologne figure. one of the Brussels figures is illustrated in Xhayet and Halleux, before p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Send the Light''' ('''STL''') was a British Christian book distributor which had absorbed other Christian publishers and bookshops, and eventually merged with the [[International Bible Society]] to become one of the largest non-profit book distributors in the world under the title of IBS-STL Global, now known as [[Biblica]].

==Early history==
The name “Send the Light” first appeared in 1957 as a Christian literature evangelism ministry sending copies of the [[Gospel of John]] from Chicago to Mexico, under the direction of [[George Verwer]], then a student at [[Moody Bible Institute]]. Verwer later moved to Bolton in the UK, where he established [[Operation Mobilisation]] (OM), which today distributes Christian literature in many countries around the world. Verwer decided to keep the name “Send the Light” for one particular aspect of OM, exporting Christian books to India. As STL, this developed into a general distributor of Christian books, and relocated to Bromley in Kent.

==Rise to Prominence==
In January 1986, Keith Danby was made chief executive of STL. Danby had a background in finance and by introducing stock catalogues, a free telephone number and next-day deliveries he increased turnover by 52% in one year. In 1988 he set up an independent board for STL which separated it from the governance of OM, and the following year the company relocated to Carlisle. In the 1990s STL began to expand its interests.

In 1992 an old Christian publisher, [[Paternoster Press]], was acquired, and the first '''Wesley Owen''' Books and Music shop was opened in Bromley. The intention was to create a “Christian [[Waterstone's]]” which would be more professional than many of the Christian bookshops then found in the UK. The following year STL took over the [[Church of Scotland]] shops, the [[Evangelical Christian Literature]] (ECL) shops, and the [[Scripture Union]] shops. Danby explained that STL’s aim was to show “excellence combined with Christian compassion”.

In 1993 OM released STL to operate as a separate organisation to allow it to concentrate on the publishing and distribution of Christian literature.[https://web.archive.org/web/20101225113214/http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Mar07/Art_Mar07_09.html].

In 2001 STL acquired Word UK, which produced books, music and videos. STL became the largest Christian organisation dealing with books in the UK. STL remained a charity, and in 2001 was listed as the 74th largest one in the UK. STL was also the main gateway for several of the biggest American Christian publishers, including [[Tyndale House]], [[Zondervan]], [[Moody Books]], [[Baker Books]], and Multnomah.

==Entering the American Market==
In 2003 STL furthered its push into the US market by acquiring OM_Literature. It also purchased the distributor FaithWorks, and in 2005 it bought its largest acquisition, Appalachian Distributors Inc. The CEO of STL USA is David Passman.

==Merger with the International Bible Society==
In January 2007, '''Send the Light''' merged with the [[International Bible Society]] providing a truly global reach. The result was the creation of one of the largest non-profit book distributors in the world. The STL leaders set a target for when the merger went through on 1 March 2007 of having “a Bible for everyone on Earth”. The new organisation became known as "IBS-STL Global" and the UK operation as '''IBS-STL (UK)''' and registered as a charity and a company limited by guarantee.

==Financial difficulties, administration==
The last set of financial statements by IBS-STL UK for the year ended 28 February 2009,&lt;ref&gt;IBS-STL UK, ''Financial Statements for the year ended 28 February 2009''&lt;/ref&gt; and approved by the Board on 6 July 2009, refer to having had a "challenging year for the Charity". This had been characterised by "a combination of weak economic conditions in the UK, and a difficult move to the new [[SAP AG|SAP]] IT system", leading to a "significant operational loss" for that year. The report highlighted the financial risks which the Charity was exposed to, particularly those associated with loans, leases, and trade debtors and creditors. There was however no indication that these risks would be so severe as to result in the collapse of the business just four months later.

On 16 November 2009 IBS-STL UK announced that due to "a succession of financial problems, in particular the failed implementation of a new [[SAP AG|SAP computer system]] in October 2008, the effects of which were exacerbated by the economic downturn" a decision had been taken to "exit the business" at which point a buyer was sought.&lt;ref&gt;STL Distribution Blog, http://stldistribution.blogspot.com/2009/11/ibs-stl-uk-trade-communication.html?showComment=1258403900001&lt;/ref&gt; However, no sale arrangement could be made and IBS STL (UK) formally entered into Administration on 18 December 2009. Two partners from [[Baker Tilly LLP|Baker Tilly Restructuring and Recovery LLP]], Manchester, were appointed by the High Court as joint administrators. The ensuing process of administration resulted in the following outcome for the principal trading activities of IBS-STL (UK) :-

=== ''STL Distribution'' ===
In December 2009 John Ritchie Ltd of Kilmarnock, Scotland, finalised a deal with the Administrators to become the owners of the Christian book distribution and wholesaler business, STL Distribution Ltd. John Ritchie Ltd stated their intention to retain Carlisle as the major base of operation for this business. Keith Danby was replaced by Ken Munro as CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stldistribution.blogspot.com/search?updated-min=2009-01-01T00:00:00Z&amp;updated-max=2010-01-01T00:00:00Z&amp;max-results=50|title=STL Distribution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Wesley Owen''===
At the time the business collapsed, IBS STL (UK) were operating a chain of 41 retail units (bookshops) under the 'Wesley Owen' brand name, situated in various towns and cities throughout the UK. In the months following, a majority of these shops were taken over by other Christian-based companies or charitable trusts leaving only a small number unable to continue trading after no buyers were found.

* '''[[Koorong|Koorong Books]]''' of Sydney, Australia, bought the Wesley Owen brand and domain names and took over 8 bookshops at Bath, Birmingham, Bristol, Bromley, Coleraine, Derby, Glasgow and York.
* '''[[CLC International]]''' of Alresford, Hampshire, took over 6 shops at Bolton, Cambridge, Coventry, Guildford, Kingston upon Thames and Stockport.
* '''Nationwide Christian Trust''' of Essex took over 19 shops and rebranded them under the trading name '''Living Oasis'''. These were at Aberdeen, Bedford, Belfast, Cheltenham, Chester, Edinburgh, Harrogate, Harrow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, South Woodford, Sutton, Watford, Weston-super-Mare and Worthing.
* The three bookshops at Falkirk, Walsall and Woking were taken over by independent traders.
* No buyers were found for the shops at Brighton, Carlisle, Dundee and Macclesfield.

===''Authentic Book Publishing''===
'''Koorong''', in addition to purchasing the Wesley Owen brand (see above), also purchased all of the '''Authentic''' and '''Paternoster''' intellectual property and author contracts and with plans to continue the book publishing business from the existing Authentic base in the Milton Keynes area.

===''Authentic Music''===
'''[[Kingsway Communications]]''' of Eastbourne, East Sussex, bought the music part of the Authentic Media business based in Milton Keynes.

==Liquidation==
On 1 December 2010, the company was moved from administration and into [[creditors' voluntary liquidation]]. The final progress report from the Administrators&lt;ref&gt;Cash, Russell and Bailey, Donald ''IBS-STL (UK) In Administration 29 November 2010'', Joint Administrators signed 10/12/10&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the largest of the Secured Creditors, [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], had been repaid £3.278m from the realisation of their legal charges over one freehold and two long leasehold sites, leaving a shortfall of £1.2m owing. [[Scripture Union]] had recovered £311k from an arrangement to receive proceeds from debtor realisations, which left 14% outstanding on the amount owing. Preferential claims comprising outstanding holiday pay to employees were settled in full. Unsecured Creditor claims aggregating to over £9.5m had not been paid at all at the end of the administration and would be addressed during liquidation. With the administrator fees and costs totalling over £500k, the funds remaining from the realised assets amounted to £2.15m. The final dividend for distribution to unsecured creditors was just over £35,000.

'''''Stairs 1 Geneva''''' is a film by [[Peter Greenaway]]. It is also a large-scale [[art installation]], an exhibition, a catalogue and a [[Compact Disc|CD]] album.

==The film==

The film comprises one hundred sequences showing a location in the city of [[Geneva]], Switzerland. In 1994, over a period of one hundred days, one hundred white wooden staircases were installed around the city to be climbed by the public. At the top of each staircase was a simple hole framing a "living picture postcard", a perfect "cinema-image by [[Peter Greenaway]]" accompanied by a commentary of one sentence in French and English, printed below the viewfinder. Greenaway's idea was to create a reflection on location in cinema and to "take films out of the theatres".[http://www.filmfestivalen.se/1994/Stairsone.html]

==The event==

[[Searchlight|Spotlight]]s of different colors were installed throughout the city. The event was called "The Stairs: Geneva The Location", and was expanded into a wider project including other cities and other cinematic themes of relaxation. The events were also published in a catalogue form and a musical compact disc (Merrell, March 1995).

==The installation==

Approximately one hundred performers representing typical regional characters, with costumes and props, ([[John Calvin|Calvin]] and his fellows reformers, different spirits of the lake, [[Laura Ashley]] with her bicycle, living statues, etc.), were sited within the framed view of the staircases' viewfinders. They all were specially trained to perform a choreography (by Serge Campardon[http://www.compagnienomades.com]) every 15 minutes. Each performer was given a luxury Genevan watch to check the time throughout the five or more hours of their performance.

==Further details==

The film's scenes show day or night views in the exact frame defined by the staircase's viewfinder. Superimposed images make some of the characters of the installation appear and disappear in the frame under different lights, and are linked with different kind of local events, such as a cycle race or a children's choir on the cathedral steps. The voice-over patiently helps the visual description by numbering the scenes by the same number of each staircase, and reading the sentence printed on the viewfinder. Each scene is accompanied by a one-minute music pattern by Patrick Mimran,[http://www.mimran.com/]. The soundtrack CD which accompanies the project suggests each piece can be played randomly, just as a visitor could visit the staircases in any order.

An exhibition was also set in the [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire (Geneva)|Musée d'Art et d'Histoire]][http://www.ville-ge.ch/musinfo/mahg/musee/mah/mah.html] where lights and slide projections supplemented a display of one hundred sculpted heads found and chosen in the museum depot, as well as one hundred historical helmets.

A '''surcoat''' or '''surcote''' initially was an outer garment commonly worn in the [[Middle Ages]] by both men and women in Western Europe. It can either refer to a coat worn over other clothes or the outermost garment itself. The name derives from [[French language|French]] meaning "over the coat", a long, loose, often sleeveless coat reaching down to the feet.&lt;ref&gt;Nunn, pp. 14, 23, 24, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Men's surcoat===
From about the 12th century, [[knight]]s wore long, flowing surcoats, frequently emblazoned with their personal [[Coat of arms|arms]], over their [[armor]]. These usually extended to about midcalf, had slits in the bottom front and back, thus allowing the wearer to ride comfortably and were either sleeved or sleeveless. Historians believe that the practice of wearing white ones was adopted during the Crusades, their main purpose of reflecting the direct sun, which overheated it (and the soldier inside); while in poor weather they helped keep rain and the muck of battle away from the easily corroded mail links; although it may be argued that here its color would have been of little help. The surcoat displayed the device of the [[knight]] (origin of the term "[[coat of arms]]") thus identifying him; which in turn, combined with the increased use of the [[great helm]] (late 12th century, early 13th century) became an essential means of recognition. Indeed, some historians cite this as one of the reasons behind the spread of [[heraldry]] across [[medieval Europe]]. During the 13th century, knights began to add plates of armour to their surcoats, that subsequently became the [[medieval]] [[coat of plates]]. In the early fourteenth century, the front of the knight's surcoat was shortened, so that it was longer at the back, knee-length at the front; thus allowing greater freedom of movement, and eliminating the danger of a rider getting his spurs caught in the garment. By the mid-fourteenth century it was replaced with the "jupon" (or "gipon"), a much shorter item, often padded for supplementary protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farr|first=E.|year=1873|title=The National History of England|volume=1|publisher=William Collins, Sons &amp; Company|location=London &amp; Glasgow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L0oBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA386|accessdate=2011-04-06 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century, once suits of plate armour became common, the surcoat was phased out of use.  The period in the history of armour development, in which surcoats became increasingly rare, is referred to as the "surcoatless period" (1420-1485).

===Women's surcoat===
Women began wearing surcoats during the 13th century, both with and without sleeves.&lt;ref name="newman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Paul B.|title=Daily Life in the Middle Ages|date=2001|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786450527|pages=115-116|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular style, known as the sideless surcoat, developed as a fashion in the 14th century. This was a sleeveless, floor-length garment featuring exaggerated armholes, which at their most extreme were open from shoulder to hip, revealing the gown underneath. The narrow strip covering the torso, known as the plackard,&lt;ref name="cumming"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cumming|first1=Valerie|last2=Cunnington|first2=C. W.|last3=Cunnington|first3=P.

The style drew criticism from some moralists, who thought the garment drew an inappropriate amount of attention to the female body.&lt;ref name="newman"/&gt; Despite this, sideless surcoats continued to be worn as ceremonial dress well into the 15th century, long after they had ceased to be fashionable. Some estimates place them being worn as state apparel as late as 1525.&lt;ref name="cumming"/&gt;

'''Tale Spinners for Children''' was a series of stories and novels adapted for young audiences on vinyl records in the early 1960s. They included a collection of old [[fairy tales]], [[folklore]], literary classics such as ''[[Don Quixote]]'' and ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', and time-honored [[fables]], with the title role sometimes played by a renowned theatrical actor or actress. (Many of the actors who appeared, however, such as [[Maggie Smith]] or [[Alec McCowen]], became more famous for other roles years after the albums were released, and some of the actors, such as [[Donald Pleasence]], who played Don Quixote, or [[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]], who played several villainous roles, were not even identified on the album covers.) The series gave children an exposure to timeless classic stories.

Originally only 30 records were pressed in England and France and sold as [[Atlas Talespinners]] under the [[Atlas Record]] label, and included an easy to follow story booklet. Within a few years, these records were introduced to the U.S. as Tale Spinners for Children under the [[United Artists Records]] label. What was known as the Atlas Theatre Company in England was marketed as the Famous Theatre Company in the United States. The story booklets were not included in the U.S. releases.

UA continued to produce more stories records until the early 1970s, and distribute them in the Canadian&lt;ref&gt;Manufactured and Distributed in Canada by The Compo Company Ltd., Lachine, Que.&lt;/ref&gt; and Australian&lt;ref&gt;Manufactured and Distributed in Australia Under License from United Artists Records, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; markets as well.

With popular children's record companies like [[Walt Disney Records]] already on the market, a host of other record companies followed: [[Mercury Storyteller]] series, [[Golden Records]], [[Telegeneral Let's Pretend]], [[Riverside Wonderland]] and [[Pathways of Sound]].

==History==
United Artists released the 30 original stories in the US in 1962. The recording labels changed when [[Liberty Records]] (its budget subsidiary [[Sunset Records]]) and [[United Artists Records]]&lt;ref&gt;©LIBERTY/UA, INC., Los Angeles, Calf.&lt;/ref&gt;  merged in 1968 after [[Transamerica Corporation|Transamerica]]&lt;ref&gt;DEPT. SUS 6920 Sunset Blvd. Los Angeles, Calif. (90028)&lt;/ref&gt; bought Liberty. All labels were merged under United Artists in 1971. When Liberty was deactivated in 1971 (for the first time) both the Sunset and Talespinners series was leased by [[Springboard International]]&lt;ref&gt;Distributed by SPRINGBOARD INTERNATIONAL RECORDS, INC., 947 U.S. Highway 1, Rahway, New Jersey 07065&lt;/ref&gt; and in the case of the Talespinners series they used the same catalog numbers until 1975. When Springboard International Records went bankrupt 1984 [[Gusto Records]] acquired some of their catalogues from [[Jay-Koala]].

==Music==
''Tale Spinners for Children'' used classical music as background and linking music in their productions.  Examples of this include:
* ''Robin Hood'' (UAC 11001) - [[Violin Concerto (Mendelssohn)|Violin Concerto in E minor]] by [[Felix Mendelssohn]]
* ''William Tell'' (UAC 11002) - [[William Tell Overture]] and Overture from ''[[La Gazza Ladra]]'' by [[Gioachino Rossini]]
* ''The Three Musketeers'' (UAC 11007) - "The Dance of the Furies" from ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' by [[Christoph Gluck]]
* ''Treasure Island'' (UAC 11013) - [[Symphonie fantastique]] by [[Hector Berlioz]] ''(also used in "Hiawatha" [UAC 11054])''
* ''Sinbad the Sailor'' (UAC 110020) - [[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherazade]] by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] ''(also used in "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves" [UAC 11018] and "Aladdin and the Magic Lamp" [UAC 11019])''
* ''Rip Van Winkle'' (UAC 11034) - [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|Overture for A Midsummer Night's Dream]] by [[Felix Mendelssohn]]
* ''Christopher Columbus'' (UAC 11040) - [[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|New World Symphony]] by [[Antonín Dvořák]]
* ''The Little Mermaid'' (UAC 11042) - [[Piano Concerto (Grieg)|Piano Concerto in A minor]] by [[Edvard Grieg]]
* ''The Count of Monte Cristo'' (UAC 11044) - [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No. 6]] by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]

{{distinguish|text=''The Company of Strangers: A Natural History of Economic Life'' by [[Paul Seabright]]}}
'''''The Company of Strangers''''' (US release title: '''''Strangers in Good Company'''''; French title: '''''Le Fabuleux gang des sept'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com Fabuleux gang des sept, Le, Angela Stukator, ''L'Encyclopédie canadienne]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Canadian film, released in 1990. It was directed by [[Cynthia Scott]], and written by Scott, [[Sally Bochner]], [[David Wilson (producer)|David Wilson]] and [[Gloria Demers]]. The film depicts eight women on a bus tour, who are stranded at an isolated cottage when the bus breaks down.

Created in a genre defined as [[docufiction]], semi-documentary/semi-fiction,&lt;ref&gt;Diana, George. Semi-Documentary/Semi-Fiction: An Examination of Genre in "Strangers in Good Company". Journal of Film and Video, v46 n4 p24-30 Win 1995&lt;/ref&gt; the film is not tightly scripted. The writers wrote a basic story outline but allowed the eight women to improvise their dialogue. Each of the women, all but one of whom were [[senior citizen]]s, told stories from her own life. A major theme of the film is how the elderly women each face aging and mortality in their own way, and find the courage together to persevere.

At various points throughout the film, a montage of photos from each woman's life is shown.

The women are:
* Alice Diabo, 74, a [[Mohawk Nation|Mohawk]] elder from [[Kahnawake, Quebec]],
* Constance Garneau, 88, born in the United States and brought to Quebec by her family as a child,
* Winifred Holden, 76, an Englishwoman who moved to Montreal after World War II,
* Cissy Meddings, 76, who was born in England and moved to Canada in 1981,
* [[Mary Meigs]], 74, a noted [[feminist]] writer and painter,
* Catherine Roche, 68, a Roman Catholic nun,
* [[Michelle Sweeney]], 27, a [[jazz]] singer and the bus trip's tour guide,
* Beth Webber, 80, who was born in England and moved to Montreal in 1930.

Meigs published a book about her experiences making the film, ''In the Company of Strangers'', in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/library/exhibits/mawrtyrs/meigs.html |title=Mary Meigs |work=Mawrtyrs |publisher=Bryn Mawr College |accessdate=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

The film won the Best Canadian film award at the [[Vancouver International Film Festival]] and the Grand Prize and Interfilm awards at the [[International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg|Mannheim-Heidelberg International Film Festival]] in 1990.

At the [[12th Genie Awards]] in 1991, Diabo and Meddings were nominated for Best Actress, Holden and Roche were nominated for Best Supporting Actress, and the film was nominated for Best Picture. The film won the Genie Award for Best Film Editing.

'''''The Diary of a Teenage Girl: An Account in Words and Pictures''''' is a diaristic graphic novel by author and artist [[Phoebe Gloeckner]]. It is notable for its hybrid form, composed of both prose and "comics" passages, each contributing to the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Meisha|title=Multi-modality in Phoebe Gloeckner's The Diary of a Teenage Girl|journal=International Journal of Comic Art|date=2007|volume=2|issue=9|pages=396–412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First published in 2002, the book has been called "autobiography" or "semi-autobiography."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Groth|first1=Gary|title=The Phoebe Gloeckner Interview|url=http://www.tcj.com/phoebe-gloeckner-2/|website=The Comics Journal|accessdate=2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story is told by its protagonist Minnie Goetze, a 15-year-old girl living in San Francisco, CA. The year is 1976, and Minnie, the daughter of a young single mother, loses her virginity to her mother's boyfriend, Monroe Rutherford, and soon thereafter begins writing obsessively in her diary. As she careens towards coming-of-age, she searches for love but confuses it with sex. The book presents a complex and jarring look into the interior life of an adolescent girl, and has been described as raw and disturbing, not only because of its subject matter, but because of Minnie's frank and precociously intelligent point of view and commentary on the lives of the adults in her midst.

==Plot==
Minnie Goetz is a 15-year-old girl living in San Francisco with her mother Charlotte, who was a teenager when Minnie was born, and her younger sister Gretel. Minnie begins keeping a diary after her mother's on-again, off-again boyfriend Munroe begins to make sexual advances towards her. Munroe takes her out drinking to a bar one day and initiates sex between them.

Minnie has mixed feelings about her relationship with Munroe, feeling attracted to him sexually but resenting the way he treats her and the secretive nature of their relationship. She longs to confide in her mother about Munroe but feels she cannot as Munroe and her mother still sleep together and she has a cold relationship with her mother as she once heard her step-father Pascal refer to her need to be held and touched by her mother as "sexual".

Minnie begins to sleep with more boys her own age but is disappointed and disillusioned to find that they make fun of her with their friends. She begins to spend more time with her friend Kimmie, who prostitutes herself to various friends and neighbours for petty cash. Through Kimmie, Minnie begins to take drugs for the first time.

Munroe begins a mail order business for diet pills. His goal is to be rich and retire by the time he is 40 which Minnie disapproves of as a goal. After listening to his motivational tapes she decides she wants to be a cartoonist. She writes a fan letter to [[Aline Kominsky-Crumb]] who writes one back to her. Minnie also begins skipping more classes and is thrown out of school for her poor attendance. She is forced to attend a public school and is only accepted on a trial basis on the strength of her artistic talents.

Minnie confesses to Munroe that she loves him and he does not reciprocate, causing her to feel angry towards him. Whenever she tries to initiate sex he has her perform oral sex on him which Minnie finds unsatisfying. Minnie's step-father Pascal tells Minnie's mother that he believes that Munroe has sexual intentions towards Minnie. Munroe convinces Minnie's mother, Charlotte, that the beliefs are unfounded. Pascal then tells Minnie he is leaving for New York, but promises to always stay in touch telling Minnie he thinks of her and Gretel as his children.

While out with her friends Minnie meets Tabatha, a teenage lesbian hustler. Minnie feels attracted to Tabatha though her friends warn her against spending time with her. Minnie continues to skip school and is given a therapist to whom she confesses her relationship with Munroe.

Minnie's mother discovers her diary and confronts Minnie and Munroe about their relationship. She tells Munroe he must marry her daughter and Munroe agrees though Minnie thinks the idea is ridiculous. She begins spending time at Munroe's apartment with her mother's consent. One of her friends confides in her that she slept with Pascal and Minnie is angered and hurt that he would sleep with someone her age. She runs away with Tabatha who gives her roofies and allows her to be raped in exchange for pills. Minnie finally returns home. She stops taking drugs and drinking for two months and starts to attend school. She convinces her mother not to bring Munroe to their home anymore but is hurt by the knowledge that her mother continues to see Munroe on the side.

Meeting one of her friends she decides to get high one more time with the crystal meth left over in her purse. She and her friend compose and sell poems by the beach while they are tripping and Minnie sees Munroe who is out jogging. She sells him one of her poems and the two say their goodbyes.

'''''The Return of Courtney Love'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockdirt.com/the-return-of-courtney-love/20285/ |title='The Return Of Courtney Love' |date=1 October 2006 |work= |publisher=rockdirt.com |accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 2006 [[documentary film]] by Will Yapp documenting the progression of musician [[Courtney Love]]'s second studio album, ''How Dirty Girls Get Clean'', as well as her recovery from drug addiction. The documentary was first broadcast on [[More4]] in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 26 September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0958172/releaseinfo |title=The Return of Courtney Love (2006) (TV) - Release dates |author=IMDb |year=2006 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The documentary begins with director Will Yapp arriving at Courtney Love's rented home in [[Beverly Hills]], [[California]] in March 2006 to find her chanting with friends in her living room — a routine, as Love practices [[Nichiren Buddhism]]. Love goes on to explain her religious and spiritual experiences.

The next focus of the documentary is Love's ill-fated 2004 solo debut, ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]''. Co-writer and partial producer, [[Linda Perry]] — also a friend of Love's — explains the circumstances surrounding the album's recording, citing Love's drug abuse as the reason for the album's ruin. As well as this, Perry and Love's friend [[Billy Corgan]] of [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] state that the reason for the album's critical and commercial failure was Love's public image, which at the time was plagued by constant court appearances and an infamous appearance on [[Pamela Anderson]]'s ''[[Comedy_Central_Roast#Pamela_Anderson|Comedy Roast]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0474603/fullcredits |title=Comedy Central Roast of Pamela Anderson (2005) (TV) - Full cast and crew |author=IMDb |year=2005 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Love's recent background is explained, the documentary focuses on the recording of her then-upcoming solo second album, ''How Dirty Girls Get Clean''. As Love and her solo band perform a rehearsal version of the title track, Love explains the album's songs, calling them "all acerbic [...] none of them are tender love songs or very nice. They're all songs about disaster." Love also explains her motivation for the album. Later in the documentary, the focus again switches back to the recording of ''How Dirty Girls Get Clean'' with in-studio footage, as well as documenting the song-writing and production process with Linda Perry and [[Billy Corgan]]. After three weeks of recording, a fully produced version of "Sunset Marquis" is previewed.

The next segment of the documentary focuses on Love's late husband, [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]], their relationship, and his death. As well as showing never-before-seen private home footage, Love shows the coat that Cobain killed himself in,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=59507 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - COURTNEY LOVE Shows Jacket KURT COBAIN Killed Himself In |author=BLABBERMOUTH.NET |date=30 September 2006 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming emotional and saying that "it freaks [her] out." Further explaining their relationship, a clip of Love performing "[[Pacific Coast Highway (song)|Pacific Coast Highway]]" — a song rumoured to be about Cobain — is shown. Further in the documentary, legal issues concerning Love's rights to Nirvana's back catalogue are highlighted, as well as Love's financial state.

Love's other non-musical projects are also showcased at one point in the documentary, specifically her book ''[[Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love]]''. At this point, Love also explains her childhood and upbringing, referring to it as "[[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]ian." Incidentally, Love's relationship with her daughter, [[Frances Bean Cobain]] is also explored. Love then visits her personal mentor, [[Carrie Fisher]], and discuss methods for Love to avoid attention in British [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]s and Love's romantic history.

As the documentary ends, Love talks about her future ambitions and the release of the album.

==Previewed music==
''The Return of Courtney Love'''s highlight is the music previewed throughout the documentary. Rehearsal clips, demo previews and in-studio recording footage showcase the progression of songs later released and provide a unique insight into Love's song-writing process.

Music featured in the documentary includes:
* An acoustic rehearsal version of "How Dirty Girls Get Clean"
* An in-studio recording, a rehearsal version, and a rough studio mix of "Pacific Coast Highway"
* Two rehearsal versions of "Stand Up, Motherfucker"
* A demo preview of an unknown song
* An in-studio recording of "The Depths of My Despair"
* A rough studio mix of "Happy Ending Story"
* An acoustic rehearsal, an in-studio recording, and a rough studio mix of "Sunset Marquis"
* An acoustic rehearsal of an unknown song
* An in-studio recording of "For Once in Your Life"
* A studio recording of "Sad But True" is featured in the United States version.

Four of the featured songs in the documentary appeared on [[Hole (band)|Hole]]'s fourth studio album, ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'', in 2010. ''Nobody's Daughter'' — which was the final product of Love's unreleased ''How Dirty Girls Get Clean'' — was originally due to be the reworked version of ''How Dirty Girls Get Clean'', however, was rerecorded as a Hole album in 2009.

==Reception==
Though well-received with Love's fans, Tim Teeman of ''[[The Times]]'' criticised the documentary's content and director, noting that it "wasn't painful viewing for the reasons its subject intended [...] but for the cowed awe of Will Yapp, the film's writer, director and producer. It's one thing to ingratiate oneself with a subject to elicit their secrets, but this was something else. Yapp seemed to want to be Love's friend, not her inquisitor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article651736.ece |title=Love's labours are lost on me ... - Times Online |work=[[The Times]] |date=28 September 2006 |publisher= |accessdate=24 August 2010 |location=London |first=Last |last=Night's}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5774">'''Vladimir Slepian''', a.k.a. '''Eric Pid''' ({{lang-ru|Владимир Слепян / Эрик Пид}}; 1930 – 7 July 1998) is a [[France|French]] artist and writer of [[Russia]]n-[[Jew]]ish origin.

==Biography==
Son of a repressed and executed Soviet functionary, Vladimir Slepian was born in [[Prague]] and resided in [[Leningrad]] before moving to [[Moscow]]. He began his university studies in mathematics, continuing as a student of fine art. In 1956 Slepian moved to Moscow. He attended the Picasso exhibition at the [[Pushkin Museum]] and presented his paintings to [[David Burliuk]], who was then staying at [[Hotel Moskva (Moscow)|Hotel Moskva]]. Burliuk inspired Slepian to look towards the way [[Jackson Pollock]] deposited paint on canvas with broad, lunging, spontaneous gestures. Slepian’s style evolved towards [[happening]] and [[performance art]]. He devoted several years to [[action painting]]. On one occasion, Slepian conducted a séance of simultaneous painting in collaboration with [[Yuri Zlotnikov]]. They suspended a bedsheet in the middle of a room and each of them painted one side of it whilst following the actions of his partner on the other side through the translucent fabric. Slepian created abstract paintings using a gas torch and paint dispensed out of a pump. He is said to have worked on a canvas a few kilometers long, by pouring paint on it from a truck. Slepian also made a pilgrimage to [[Nazım Hikmet]], who assured him and his friends that modern art will prevail over political oppression. In 1957 Paris' Right Bank Galerie Daniel Cordier mounted an anonymous exhibition of paintings by Vladimir Slepian, smuggled out of Moscow by its owner.

Vladimir Slepian emigrated to [[France]] in 1958, by way of [[Poland]]. In 1960 he conducted a performance of “transfinite painting” ("трансфинитная живопись") in Paris. Slepian sprinted along a roll of paper a hundred meters long, depositing paint in a manner that recalled calligraphy. Slepian competed with [[Georges Mathieu]], by creating a picture in ninety seconds. He is said to have turned a road into an action painting by throwing paint onto it whilst riding a motorcycle. In 1963, Slepian gave up painting, resolving to concentrate on writing. He founded a successful translation bureau, explaining his ambition as using his intelligence to put others to work for his benefit, whilst enjoying idleness. His business operated successfully until its manager quit in a protest against Slepian’s despotism.

In his only published French text, a short story ''Fils de chien'', Vladimir Slepian writes of a man who decides to become a dog. He transforms himself one limb and one organ at a time, mapping the effects of the canine body across a human form in a kind of diagramming. Since dogs are quadrupeds, he ties shoes to his hands and feet. When his paws prevent him from lacing the fourth shoe, he uses his mouth, which becomes a dog's snout. This metamorphosis almost succeeds, until the hero comes to the dog’s tail, for which he can find no analogue among human limbs. For him to involve his sexual organ in this transmogrification would tear him away from the society that he has begun to flee. Who would he be, if his identity could not be inferred from his anatomy? The story ends with a descent into childhood memories of the protagonist's mother. It appeared in n° 7 of the ''[[Revue Minuit]]'' alongside texts by [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Robert Pinget]], and [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]]. It served as inspiration for discussion by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]''.

Several years later, Vladimir Slepian renamed himself Eric Pid. He explained his new French name as an anagram of the blind king Oedipus, alluding to blindness at the etymological origins of his Russian family name. In his later years, Slepian succeeded at having his dramatic text staged as an interpolation in ''[[A quand Agamemnon ?]]'', an adaptation of [[Aeschylus]]’ ''[[Agamemnon]]'' by Philippe Brunet and Demodocos, a band of young artists specialized in classical theatre, performed in French, Latin and/or ancient Greek. He went around Paris, distributing framed photographs of this performance for wall display at restaurants. On 7 July 1998, Slepian collapsed on a sidewalk at [[Saint-Germain des Prés]]. The cause of his death is variously reported as [[hunger]] and a [[Myocardial infarction|cardiac crisis]]. He was buried as an [[indigent]], at the state’s expense.

Vladimir Slepian’s life served as inspiration for Viktor Atemian, the protagonist of 2007 feature film ''L’Homme qui marche'' by [[Aurélia Georges]].
