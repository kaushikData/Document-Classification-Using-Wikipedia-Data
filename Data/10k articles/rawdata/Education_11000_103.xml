'''Aaron Brennan''' is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'', played by Matt Wilson. The actor received the role after a long casting process, during which Wilson sent the producers a recording of himself performing a scene, before attending an audition. Wilson relocated from Sydney to Melbourne for filming. The character was initially intended to be a guest part, but due to Wilson's "endearing quality", he was promoted to the full-time cast. He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 16 June 2015. Aaron was the third Brennan sibling to be introduced, following his brothers [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]) and [[Tyler Brennan]] ([[Travis Burns (actor)|Travis Burns]]) in 2010 and 2015 respectively.

Aaron is portrayed as a confident, happy, occasionally naive, optimist. He was initially shown to be closer to Tyler than Mark, but the brothers were bonded when their estranged father was introduced. The character had a unique entrance to the show as an exotic dancer performing at The Waterhole. Wilson took dance lessons ahead of his first scenes. Aaron has embarked on various careers throughout his duration, including bodyguard and social media manager. Aaron is openly gay, and he has formed relationships with established regular [[Nate Kinski]] ([[Meyne Wyatt]]), despite initially having nothing in common, and later [[Tom Quill]] (Kane Felsinger) and [[David Tanaka]] ([[Takaya Honda]]). The character has received a positive response from television critics and viewers. He was named Best New Male Character of 2015 by a columnist for ''Soap World''.

==Casting==
On 17 May 2015, it was announced actor and model Matt Wilson had joined the cast as Aaron Brennan, the middle brother of established characters [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]) and [[Tyler Brennan]] (Travis Burns).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/news/a647877/all-change-for-neighbours-four-new-regulars-join-the-soaps-cast/#~pcYKylGLFjEg03|title=All change for Neighbours: Four new regulars join the soap's cast|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=17 May 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was given the role of Aaron after a long casting process.&lt;ref name="Kilkelly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/interviews/a654854/neighbours-newcomer-matt-wilson-interview-more-brennans-will-arrive/|title=Neighbours newcomer Matt Wilson interview: 'More Brennans will arrive'|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=25 June 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process started with Wilson recording himself performing a scene and sending the footage to the producers, who then invited him to attend an audition.&lt;ref name="Kilkelly"/&gt; During the lengthy waiting period, Wilson watched the show "religiously", which made him want to be a part of the cast even more.&lt;ref name="Molloy"/&gt; Months after his audition, Wilson was sent an email informing him he had won the role.&lt;ref name="Kilkelly"/&gt; Of joining the cast, Wilson said "It's surreal. This stuff is part of your living room growing up and never in my wildest dreams did I think I would have this chance."&lt;ref name="Bamford"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/matt-wilson-welcome-to-our-newest-neighbour/story-fni0cvc9-1227378507617|title=Matt Wilson: Welcome to our newest Neighbour|last=Bamford|first=Matt|date=1 June 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson relocated from Sydney to Melbourne, where the ''Neighbours'' studios are located.&lt;ref name="Molloy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/hunky-underwear-model-and-actor-matt-wilson-arrives-on-ramsay-street-playing-a-gay-male-stripper/story-e6frfkp9-1227400639625|title=Hunky underwear model and actor Matt Wilson arrives on Ramsay Street, playing a gay male stripper|last=Molloy|first=Shannon|date=17 June 2016|publisher=[[news.com.au]]|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut appearance as Aaron during the episode broadcast on 16 June 2015.&lt;ref name="Bamford"/&gt; Executive producer [[Jason Herbison]] later revealed that Aaron was only ever intended to be a guest character, but Wilson's "endearing quality" led him to be promoted to the full-time cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Sarah|date=3–9 October 2015|title=I'm proud of how hard we worked on the 30th anniversary episodes!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=39|pages=44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Characterisation===
In his fictional backstory, Aaron left his hometown of [[Port Lincoln]] shortly after Mark's departure. Aaron had not seen his brothers in six years, as he was living on the other side of the country, but they had kept in contact and stayed close.&lt;ref name="CCrick"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crick|first=Claire|date=20 June – 3 July 2015|title=I'm prepared for lots of topless scenes!|journal=[[All About Soap]]|issue=351|pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron gets bored doing the same job every day and he eventually realised that working down the mines was not something he wanted to do anymore.&lt;ref name="CCrick"/&gt; Wilson told Claire Crick of ''[[All About Soap]]'' that after Aaron saw a male dance show in Perth, he made "a snap decision" to become an exotic dancer. Wilson said Aaron's career choice was similar to the characters featured in the 2012 film ''[[Magic Mike]]''.&lt;ref name="CCrick"/&gt;

At the time of his arrival, Aaron was much closer to his younger brother Tyler as they both liked to live in the moment, whereas Mark was a bit more sensible and [[Obsessive compulsive disorder|OCD]].&lt;ref name="CCrick"/&gt; Wilson thought Aaron liked being the middle brother because he loves to be the centre of attention. The actor commented, "There's definitely no middle-child syndrome here! He's quick to mediate any arguments between the other two."&lt;ref name="CCrick"/&gt; Wilson also said Aaron was opportunistic like Tyler, but he understood limitations like Mark.&lt;ref name="CCrick"/&gt; McGregor opined Mark's younger siblings made him a stronger character, while Burns thought Aaron's arrival had changed the dynamic between Mark and Tyler.&lt;ref name="Brennans"/&gt;

Wilson described Aaron as "a very confident young guy", who loves life and is not easily fazed. He also likes to make others happy.&lt;ref name="Molloy"/&gt; The actor also told Daniel Kilkelly of [[Digital Spy]]: "Aaron's an infectious person. He's really happy, he's an optimist, he's got a lot of energy and there's a really good vibe which comes off him. He's received well by absolutely everyone."&lt;ref name="Kilkelly"/&gt; A writer for the official ''Neighbours'' website described the character has having "a big heart, and a cheeky streak."&lt;ref name="AB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tenplay.com.au/channel-eleven/neighbours/characters/aaron-brennan|title=Matt Wilson as Aaron Brennan|publisher=[[Tenplay]]|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also said Aaron's family was important to him and he would do anything for his siblings.&lt;ref name="AB"/&gt; Speaking to Hazel Bradley of ''[[The West Australian]]'', Wilson admitted that he shared some similarities with his character, such as optimism and selflessness. However, Wilson thought Aaron was also naïve and occasionally vulnerable.&lt;ref name="Bradley"/&gt;

Aaron is openly gay, and Wilson told Peter Gray of ''[[Q News (Australian magazine)|Q News]]'' that he felt no pressure portraying a gay character, as there was a lot of support for Aaron.&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qnews.com.au/meet-matt-wilson-ramsay-streets-hottest-resident/|title=Meet Matt Wilson, Ramsay Street's hottest resident|last=Gray|first=Peter|date=5 September 2015|work=[[Q News (Australian magazine)|Q News]]|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called Aaron "a typical Aussie gay guy", which, he believed, was not well represented on Australian television at the time.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt; Wilson turned to his own gay friends while researching Aaron's wardrobe. He thought the character was similar to them and based the clothing on items they wear.&lt;ref name="Knox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2016/03/ok-to-be-gay-in-erinsborough-says-matt-wilson.html|title=Ok to be gay in Erinsborough, says Matt Wilson|last=Knox|first=David|date=24 March 2016|publisher=[[TV Tonight]]|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson thought Aaron would be a good boyfriend because he was romantic, but his career put a strain on his past relationships.&lt;ref name="CCrick"/&gt; While his siblings have accepted Aaron's sexuality, their father struggled with it, but Aaron refused to let it get to him.&lt;ref name="AB"/&gt;

===Introduction===
{{Quote box|width=19%|align=right|bgcolor=#F0F8FF|quote="I knew this could not be a better way to enter a show. Some people arrive on Neighbours in a taxi on the Street, but Aaron comes in with an absolute bang so I was quite honoured to be playing him."&lt;ref name="Kilkelly"/&gt;|source=—Wilson on Aaron's unique entrance to the show. (2015)}}
Mark contacted Aaron after fearing that Tyler had "gone off the rails", following his arrest. Mark knew Aaron and Tyler had a close relationship and he needed Aaron's help.&lt;ref name="Brennans"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Sarah|date=27 June – 3 July 2015|title=We joke that the Brennans must be allergic to t-shirts!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=25|pages=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Mark and Tyler assumed Aaron still worked down the mines in Western Australia, but he had secretly switched careers to become an exotic dancer. At the same time Mark contacted Aaron, he was booked to appear at a charity bingo night hosted by [[Sheila Canning]] ([[Colette Mann]]) at The Waterhole.&lt;ref name="Flesh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Carena|date=20 June – 3 July 2015|title=In the flesh!|journal=[[All About Soap]]|issue=351|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron was set to perform his routine in the bar when bingo was called. Sheila encouraged Mark and Tyler to attend the event and they were "stunned" to see their brother half-naked on the stage.&lt;ref name="Flesh"/&gt;

Wilson explained that he had no dance experience coming into the show and took private lessons ahead of filming. He commented, "I hit the stage with 100 per cent confidence, so all of my efforts paid off!"&lt;ref name="Brennans"/&gt; Mark was unimpressed with his younger brother's new career choice and berated him for it, while Tyler was amused. He was further cheered up when Aaron helped him out at the garage. Mark made an effort to bond with his brothers, after seeing how close Aaron and Tyler were.&lt;ref name="Flesh"/&gt;

===Relationship with Nate Kinski===
As Aaron settled onto [[Ramsay Street]], Tyler learned he was single and he decided to try and set Aaron up on a date with his friend [[Nate Kinski]] ([[Meyne Wyatt]]). Tyler's motive for the matchmaking scheme was his need to repair his broken friendship with Nate, who had not forgiven him for stealing a prescription pad from [[Karl Kennedy]] ([[Alan Fletcher (actor)|Alan Fletcher]]).&lt;ref name="Flesh"/&gt; Aaron and Nate's first meeting did not go well, as they disagreed about everything and realised that they had nothing in common. Despite Tyler's efforts to get them to agree on something, Aaron and Nate realised what he was trying to do and told him that nothing was going to happen between them.&lt;ref name="Flesh"/&gt; Tyler's scheme did manage to get Nate to reconcile with him.&lt;ref name="Flesh"/&gt; Of the scenes, Wilson told Kilkelly: "Although Aaron is quite an infectious person and everyone receives him really well, for some unbeknown reason Nate just gives him the cold shoulder. Aaron doesn't really know how to handle that. The scene where Tyler tries to set us up is hilarious - it's an absolute car crash of a scene!"&lt;ref name="Kilkelly"/&gt;

Nate initially did not want anything to do with Aaron, but then Aaron got involved with his feud with [[Alistair Hall]] (Nick Cain) in an effort to help him out. Wilson said that Nate did not like Aaron's "game-playing".&lt;ref name="CCrick"/&gt; Sheila later charged a reluctant Nate with the task of getting Aaron to sign an employment contract for The Waterhole. Nate kept making snide comments about Aaron's career, so he refused to sign the contract.&lt;ref name="Feeling"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2–16 July 2015|title=Can't fight the feeling|journal=TV Soap|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheila told Nate to make things right with Aaron, forcing him to beg. Aaron enjoyed seeing Nate's discomfort and agreed to sign the contract if he only dealt with Sheila.&lt;ref name="Feeling"/&gt; However, when Sheila suffered [[trismus|lock jaw]], she forced Aaron and Nate to work together and they could resist taunting each other. Nate teased Aaron by telling him he found him to be attractive, while Aaron went to kiss him, only to pull away quickly.&lt;ref name="Feeling"/&gt; A ''TV Soap'' writer observed "it's beginning to look like there might be a mutual attraction behind Nate and Aaron's guarded exteriors."&lt;ref name="Feeling"/&gt;

Aaron and Nate were forced to spend more time together when [[Naomi Canning]] ([[Morgana O'Reilly]]) locked them in an outdoor hotel room with a glass front as part of a promotion for Lassiter's Hotel.&lt;ref name="Public"&gt;{{cite journal|date=25–31 July 2015|title=Public passion!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=29|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline started with Naomi hiring Aaron and a female model to pose as a happy couple. However, when the female model failed to turn up, Naomi grabbed Nate and locked him inside the room with Aaron.&lt;ref name="Public"/&gt; Nate decided to make the most of the situation and he hoped he could annoy Aaron in the process. Wyatt said, "after a while Nate doesn't even notice the audience and starts to lighten up, which surprises Aaron."&lt;ref name="Public"/&gt; Naomi's plan was a success, as Lassiter's received positive press about its support for same-sex relationships. She then asked the men to do something special for a photograph and Nate spontaneously kissed Aaron.&lt;ref name="Public"/&gt; Nate enjoyed the kiss and it became clear that he had strong feelings for Aaron. Wyatt thought the characters were "a good balance", but a future relationship depended on whether they could be themselves around each other.&lt;ref name="Public"/&gt;

When Aaron attempted to cheer up his friend [[Josh Willis (Neighbours)|Josh Willis]] ([[Harley Bonner]]) by acting as his [[wingman (social)|wingman]] for the evening, he put himself in danger when her boyfriend [[Evan Shields]] (Daniel Fischer) appeared.&lt;ref name="Rescue"&gt;{{cite journal|date=5–11 September 2015|title=Nate races to the rescue!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=35|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron tried to smooth things over, but he and Evan squared up to each other, leaving Josh to defuse the situation.&lt;ref name="Rescue"/&gt; As Aaron walked home, Evan appeared and threw a drink in his face, before attacking him.&lt;ref name="Rescue"/&gt; Wilson said it was a "pretty bad" moment, but Nate came to Aaron's rescue and dragged Evan away, before scaring him off. Aaron did not have a chance to thank Nate, as he left the scene.&lt;ref name="Rescue"/&gt; Neither Aaron and Nate were willing to accept that they had romantic feelings for each other.&lt;ref name="Trick"&gt;{{cite journal|date=27 August – 10 September 2015|title=Trick or treat|journal=TV Soap|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nate believed Aaron was not interested in him, so when Aaron offered to be his slave for the week to make up for injuring him during [[Tai Chi]], Nate was unaware Aaron was trying to flirt with him.&lt;ref name="Trick"/&gt; Nate later confronted Aaron, who confessed to having feelings for him. But Nate thought Aaron was joking and Aaron was "crushed" by his rejection. Tyler then told Nate that his brother was attracted to him.&lt;ref name="Trick"/&gt;

Aaron and Nate eventually developed a relationship. After Nate got involved in a fight, he decided to leave town to clear his head. Aaron was "angry and upset" when he learnt that Nate had returned to Australia and had not been in contact with him.&lt;ref name="Ethical"/&gt; Wilson said Aaron and Nate had "a lot of stuff to sort out",&lt;ref name="Falconer"/&gt; while adding that the characters wanted to be together, but were unsure if they could make it work.&lt;ref name="Crawford"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Carena|date=23 April – 6 May 2016|title=Aaron really thought he'd killed someone!|journal=[[All About Soap]]|issue=373|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued, "Ever since they first met they've always argued about the small suff and they're still doing it now."&lt;ref name="Crawford"/&gt; Wilson later commented that as much as they loved each other, they could not live with each other because they were opposites.&lt;ref name="Pants"&gt;{{cite journal|date=30 April – 6 May 2016|title=My friends send me pictures of me in my pants!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=17|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that the couple complemented one another well, as "Nate is really closed off, whereas Aaron is a lot more free and happy."&lt;ref name="Pants"/&gt; When Nate eventually returned, he struggled to reconnect with Aaron and was "gutted" to learn that Aaron had moved on with someone else while he was away.&lt;ref name="Conscience"&gt;{{cite journal|date=9–15 April 2016|title=Aaron's guilty conscience?|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=14|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson added that Aaron resists a reconciliation as he has been hurt.&lt;ref name="Crawford"/&gt;

===Career changes and Tom Quill===
After giving up exotic dancing, Aaron briefly sold coffee and then worked as a bodyguard for "resident baddie" [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]).&lt;ref name="Bradley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Next"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tenplay.com.au/channel-eleven/neighbours/features/whats-next-for-aaron-brennan|title=What's Next for Aaron Brennan?|date=2 December 2015|publisher=[[Tenplay]]|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aaron struggled to cope with Paul's various schemes.&lt;ref name="Next"/&gt; In March 2016, Wilson teased a new darker storyline for Aaron, saying "I can't talk about it yet but anything where you have to go to the dark places in your mind is really challenging."&lt;ref name="Bradley"/&gt; Aaron was later hired to be new mayor [[Sonya Rebecchi]]'s ([[Eve Morey]]) executive assistant, and Wilson joked "I get to wear a lot of suits from here on in, which is better than wearing next to nothing, which is how I first came on the show."&lt;ref name="Bradley"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/entertainment/a/31056887/new-neighbour-makes-waves/|title=Developing role suits Matt|last=Bradley|first=Hazel|date=10 March 2016|work=[[The West Australian]]|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron also attracted the attentions of [[Tom Quill]] (Kane Felsinger), the development manager for Lassiter's Hotel.&lt;ref name="Ethical"&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 2016|title=Ethical dilemmas|journal=Soap World|issue=280|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron accepted some champagne from Tom, before realising that it could be seen as conflict of interest as Tom wanted to know Sonya's position on the proposed expansion of Lassiter's. Aaron later returned the gift to Tom, who made an advance on Aaron. As he was hurting over Nate's silence, Aaron agreed to go on a date with Tom.&lt;ref name="Ethical"/&gt; Following the success of the first date, Aaron and Tom went on another and Tom learnt that approval for the Lassiter's expansion could take months. He persuaded Aaron to give him a list of everyone opposed to the expansion and when Aaron discovered they had withdrawn their opposition, he knew he had "crossed the ethical line."&lt;ref name="Ethical"/&gt;

Tom then used Aaron's laptop to doctor an environmental impact report, leading the council to approve the development. Aaron then realised Tom had taken advantage of him and told Sonya, who fired him.&lt;ref name="Ethical"/&gt; Shortly after, an explosion at the Lassiter's Hotel dominated the show's storylines and Aaron was shown to have "a guilty conscience" over something.&lt;ref name="Falconer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/tv/matt-wilson-exclusive-neighbours-interview-hotel-death-trap-week-aaron-brennan-935271.html|title=Matt Wilson exclusive Neighbours interview - Aaron's role in Hotel Death Trap Week|last=Falconer|first=Daniel|date=5 April 2016|publisher=FemaleFirst|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron was later "anxious" to know if Tom was okay, as he had not been since that day. After hearing that Tom's ID had been found in the wreckage, Aaron feared that he was dead and tried to push Nate away. But when Nate pressed him, Aaron admitted that if Tom was dead, then it was down to him.&lt;ref name="Conscience"/&gt; In an interview with Carena Crawford of ''All About Soap'', Wilson detailed the events in the lead up to the explosion, saying "Aaron knew Tom was dodgy and went on a hunt to find out exactly what was going on. The last time Aaron saw Tom they had a bit of an altercation and got into a fight in the hotel boiler room."&lt;ref name="Crawford"/&gt; Wilson went on to explain that Aaron hit Tom and then walked away, leaving Tom in a semi-conscious state. When the boiler room exploded shortly afterwards, Aaron believed that Tom had been killed.&lt;ref name="Crawford"/&gt;

In what was billed as "a tense storyline", Aaron began receiving threatening text message from an unknown sender who knew what he did to Tom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/news/a791824/neighbours-spoilers-aaron-brennan-gets-threatening-text-message/|title=Neighbours spoilers: First look as Aaron Brennan is horrified by a threatening text message|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=25 April 2016|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron initially tried to keep the messages to himself, but he was "freaking out" as he could be charged with manslaughter or murder if his secret came out.&lt;ref name="Crawford"/&gt; Nate believed Tom's mother [[Julie Quill]] (Gail Easdale) might be behind the messages, as she had been asking Aaron a lot of questions about the day of the explosion and his relationship with Tom.&lt;ref name="Crawford"/&gt; However, once Nate discovered it was not Julie, Aaron thought that it would be best if he went to the police. Wilson told Carena Crawford of ''All About Soap'', "Aaron's finding it hard to walk around Erinsborough thinking that he's killed someone."&lt;ref name="Crawford"/&gt; The person behind the messages soon demanded $10,000 from Aaron, giving Nate a chance to set up a trap. He hid some money in an envelope at an old well and when they mystery person picked it up, they caught him.&lt;ref name="Crawford"/&gt; The person behind the messages turned out to be Tom, and Wilson said Aaron experienced "really mixed emotions" when he saw him. Aaron really believed he had killed someone and was facing time in prison and when he realised that was not going to happen, he wanted to stop Tom.&lt;ref name="Crawford"/&gt; Aaron then declared that he was going to tell Mark, but Nate warned him that he could still face charges for punching Tom.&lt;ref name="Crawford"/&gt;

===David Tanaka===

|source=—Wilson on Aaron and David.}}
In 2016, producers introduced the Tanaka twins [[David Tanaka|David]] ([[Takaya Honda]]) and [[Leo Tanaka|Leo]] (Tim Kano), who move to Erinsborough. Aaron is initially attracted to Leo, while his friend [[Amy Williams (Neighbours)|Amy Williams]] ([[Zoe Cramond]]) likes David.&lt;ref name="Hooked"&gt;{{cite journal|date=3–17 October 2016|title=Hooked on a feeling|journal=TV Soap|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron organises a night out at the Back Lane Bar in the city for the group, where Aaron realises that Leo is straight and interested in Amy. Aaron leaves the bar early, but he later sets up Amy and David on a date.&lt;ref name="Hooked"/&gt; However, he shares an "intense moment" with David, leading him to believe that David is gay. He goes to warn Amy, but is too late and she goes on her date with David. Aaron later confronts David, who insists that he is not gay and that he likes Amy.&lt;ref name="Hooked"/&gt; Aaron later helps organises a day out for David's great-grandmother [[Kazuko Sano]] (Linda Chin) and they bond. Aaron also urges David to question Kazuko about his biological father, but David is hurt by Kazuko's angry reaction.&lt;ref name="Turmoil"&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 2016|title=David in turmoil|journal=Soap World|issue=289|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron tries to apologise to David, but David thinks he is making romantic advances towards him and insults Aaron's homosexuality. He later apologises and they share another moment.&lt;ref name="Turmoil"/&gt;

After realising that he should embrace his sexuality, David goes to Number 24 late at night to see Aaron and potentially confess his feelings for him. But in a storyline twist, Aaron admits that he is not alone and actually has another man in his room, causing David to leave quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/news/a821675/neighbours-david-tanaka-aaron-brennan-missed-chance/|title=Neighbours' David Tanaka misses his chance when Aaron Brennan has another guy in bed|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=20 February 2017|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; David [[comes out]] and realises he has feelings for Aaron. They spend ANZAC Day together, but when David tries to kiss Aaron, he is rejected.&lt;ref name="KissOff"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Sarah|date=22–28 April 2017|title=Kiss off!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=16|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson said that Aaron is not expecting the kiss, as he was thinking about Nate at the time. David feels embarrassed and runs off, which Wilson thought was true to the character.&lt;ref name="KissOff"/&gt; He explained, "They are pretty much opposites – Aaron will always stand and fight, whereas David always chooses flight."&lt;ref name="KissOff"/&gt; In an interview on [[Tenplay]], Wilson explains that while Aaron does have feelings for David, he knows that David needs to deal with his sexuality and have some fun first. Aaron hopes that David will return to him eventually.&lt;ref name="SurpriseKiss"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tenplay.com.au/channel-eleven/neighbours/show-news/matt-wilson-on-davids-surprise-kiss|title=Matt Wilson on David's surprise kiss|date=26 April 2017|publisher=[[Tenplay]]|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson liked the pairing of Aaron and David, calling them "a great couple", and he thought they could get married in the future.&lt;ref name="SurpriseKiss"/&gt;

A few months later, Aaron and David begin a relationship.&lt;ref name="AGardner"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whatsontv.co.uk/neighbours/neighbours-news/aaron-tell-david-matt-wilson-482435/|title='The time is right for Aaron to tell David how he feels,' says Neighbours' Matt Wilson|last=Gardner|first=Alison|date=11 July 2017|work=[[What's on TV]]|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson said it was getting increasingly harder for Aaron to be without David, as he explores his sexuality, as Aaron was in love with him. Wilson also pointed out that it was obvious to everyone else that the pair should be a couple.&lt;ref name="AGardner"/&gt; David's brother Leo "becomes sick of the guys misreading each other’s signals" and forces Aaron to tell David about his feelings for him during a karaoke event at The Waterhole.&lt;ref name="AGardner"/&gt; Wilson said the couple's relationship would have "great potential" for future storylines.&lt;ref name="AGardner"/&gt;

===Family introductions===
[[File:April Rose Pengilly (6280501914).jpg|thumb|left|145px|April Rose Pengilly was introduced as Aaron's younger sister Chloe in March 2018.]]
A month after Aaron's arrival, the Brennan brothers' father [[Russell Brennan]] (Russell Kiefel) was introduced and the family became the focus of a "controversial" domestic violence storyline.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a655527/neighbours-to-introduce-russell-brennan-for-domestic-violence-plot.html#~ph2vYw8rTunQkt|title=Neighbours to introduce Russell Brennan for domestic violence plot|last=Dainty|first=Sophie|date=29 June 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell abused his sons as they were growing up and the brothers later became estranged from him. Russell wants to prove that he is a changed man.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; While Mark is pleased to see his father, Tyler tries to avoid him, and Aaron is thinks about Russell's negative reaction upon learning he had a gay son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=8–14 August 2015|title=Meet Russell Brennan|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=31|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell makes plans to buy the local garage with his sons, but Tyler is still unhappy to be reunited with him. When Tyler punches Russell, he eventually tells Aaron and Mark about the abuse he had suffered at the hands of their father.&lt;ref name="RBLeaves"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/news/a667954/soap-spoilers-russell-brennan-leaves-in-neighbours-and-phoebe-discovers-shes-pregnant-in-home-and-away/|title=Soap spoilers: Russell Brennan leaves in Neighbours and Phoebe discovers she's pregnant in Home and Away|last=Dainty|first=Sophie|date=12 September 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark is initially sceptical, until he talks with Aaron and they confront Russell, who does not deny the accusations. Aaron and Mark support their younger brother and ask Russell to leave town.&lt;ref name="RBLeaves"/&gt;

Producers planned to bring Russell back, but the storyline had to be rewritten due to Kiefel's unexpected death. In 2017, it was announced the Brennan brothers' mother [[Fay Brennan]] ([[Zoe Bertram]]) would be introduced instead.&lt;ref name="Big"/&gt; Wilson said that the brothers have various issues with their mother and Aaron acts "very out of character" towards her. Wilson enjoyed exploring the family dynamic further, as well as playing Aaron's unpredictable reaction to her arrival.&lt;ref name="Big"/&gt; He also said some viewers would be able to relate to the issues that Aaron and his mother have.&lt;ref name="Big"/&gt; Aaron later admits to his partner, David, that he resents Fay for leaving the family, as he was just thirteen years old and trying to deal with his sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/spoilers/a833738/neighbours-spoilers-aaron-declares-his-love-for-david/|title=Neighbours spoiler: Aaron declares his love for David|last=Kilkelly|first=David|date=22 July 2017|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; David encourages Aaron to resolve his issues with his mother, and Wilson stated that Aaron and Fay would "go through the whole process of resolving that."&lt;ref name="Big"/&gt; 

The following year, Aaron, Mark and Tyler's younger sister [[Chloe Brennan (Neighbours)|Chloe Brennan]] ([[April Rose Pengilly]]) was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/inxs-legend-kirk-pengillys-daughter-april-rose-is-joining-longrunning-soap-neighbours/news-story/a76ee6e4b588c22bccbe399284546d96?nk=cfb429b18655ca0e93ccfee99540e4e4-1519917589|title=INXS legend Kirk Pengilly's daughter April Rose joins long-running soap Neighbours|last=Stephenson|first=Alison|date=1 March 2018|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chloe's backstory states that when Russell and Fay's marriage ended, she went to live with her mother, while the brothers stayed with Russell. The siblings only saw each other during the holidays and at Christmas.&lt;ref name="Chloe"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2018-03-27/neighbours-chloe-brennan-has-a-big-heart-and-a-big-mouth-april-rose-pengilly-interview/|title=Neighbours: 'Chloe Brennan has a big heart – and a big mouth!'

===Other storylines===
When Josh learns Aaron is looking for someone else to join his dance act, he auditions for the place, as he needs to raise money for an operation for his sick daughter.&lt;ref name="Private"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Sarah|date=15–21 August 2015|title=Private dancer!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=32|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron and Josh then form an exotic dance duo called The Heat. Josh is "terrified" when The Heat receive their first booking, a 50th birthday party at the community centre.&lt;ref name="Private"/&gt; Aaron and Josh put together a routine on the day and while the performance starts off "a bit rough", the female audience enjoy it. Aaron also enjoys the attention, while Josh receives an indecent proposal from a member of the audience.&lt;ref name="Private"/&gt; Bonner said that he and Wilson had dance lessons at the [[Ministry of Dance]] for the scenes.&lt;ref name="Private"/&gt;

Needing another job, Aaron decides to reinvent himself as a social media manager in mid-2016.&lt;ref name="Client"/&gt; He befriends his neighbour [[Xanthe Canning]] (Lilly Van der Meer) upon learning that she is being bullied online by [[internet troll|trolls]]. When Aaron realises that Xanthe is trying to lose weight and change her appearance, he becomes her mentor and tells her to ignore the trolls.&lt;ref name="Crawford"/&gt; Aaron then launches his own brand management company and Nate helps fund it.&lt;ref name="Client"&gt;{{cite journal|date=16–30 May 2016|title=The client list|journal=TV Soap|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as Aaron starts to feel disheartened, Paul Robinson asks Aaron to help him clear his name after he is charged with causing the Lassiter's explosion. Paul explains that he just wants to change public opinion of him and Aaron agrees to help.&lt;ref name="Client"/&gt; He comes up with a strategy to use social media, as traditional media sources will not touch the story. Aaron convinces [[Piper Willis]] (Mavournee Hazel) to interview Paul for her [[vlog]].&lt;ref name="Client"/&gt;

In 2017, Aaron explores another new career when he teams up with [[Mishti Sharma]] (Scarlet Vas) to purchase and run a gym.&lt;ref name="Gym"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/news/a832220/neighbours-spoilers-aaron-mishti-huge-decision/|title=Neighbours' Aaron Brennan makes a huge decision and it's good news for Mishti Sharma|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=3 July 2017|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron and Mishti bond over their respective interests in fitness, and when they learn that a local gym, The Shed, is for sale, they decide to purchase it together.&lt;ref name="Mishti"&gt;{{cite journal|date=8–14 July 2017|title=Mishti means business!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=27|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair are "left disappointed" when the gym is sold to someone else, however, when that sale falls through, Mishti puts in an offer, which is accepted.&lt;ref name="Gym"/&gt; When Mishti goes to tell Aaron what she has done, she learns that he does not want to buy the business anymore. But Aaron changes his mind when Sonya gives him a "confidence boost" by pointing out how his friendly persona and love of fitness would make him a great gym owner.&lt;ref name="Gym"/&gt; Of Mishti's bond with Aaron, Vas commented, "I think her friendship with Aaron is really cute. They're different, but fitness brings them together. Plus it's so much fun working with Matt Wilson [Aaron]. He's the kindest person."&lt;ref name="Mishti"/&gt;

For his portrayal of Aaron, Wilson received a nomination for Best Daytime Star at the 2018 [[Inside Soap Awards|''Inside Soap'' Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a862268/inside-soap-awards-2018-full-longlist-coronation-street-eastenders-emmerdale-hollyoaks/|title=Inside Soap Awards 2018 full longlist revealed: Which Corrie, EastEnders, Emmerdale and Hollyoaks stars are up?|last=Davies|first=Megan|date=24 July 2018|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron and David's partnership was nominated for Best Soap Couple at the 2018 ''[[Digital Spy]]'' Reader Awards.&lt;ref name="DS 2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Robinson |first1=Abby |title=The Digital Spy Reader Awards 2018: Vote now for your Soap favourites of the year! |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/feature/a871228/best-soap-2018/ |accessdate=1 December 2018 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]] |date=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shannon Molloy of [[news.com.au]] observed that Aaron made a "colourful and abrupt entrance".&lt;ref name="Molloy"/&gt; While an ''Inside Soap'' writer stated "Let's just say that the hunky new Brennan brother, Aaron, makes quite an entrance…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidesoap.co.uk/5-top-treats-from-tuesday-nights-soaps/|title=Five top treats from Tuesday night’s soaps!|date=30 June 2015|work=[[Inside Soap]]|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another contributor to the publication wrote that the character "made quite the impression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidesoap.co.uk/phwoarsday-its-a-neighbours-brennan-brother-bonanza/|title=Phwoarsday: It's a Neighbours Brennan brother bonanza!|date=2 July 2015|work=[[Inside Soap]]|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony D.

Claire Crick from ''All About Soap'' was pleased to meet the latest Brennan brother, commenting "We've been waiting for weeks in the ''All About Soap'' office, and as of today Aaron Brennan is finally on our screens.

She also branded him "lovely Aaron".&lt;ref name="Crick"/&gt; Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly dubbed the character "Erinsborough's nice guy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/news/a786348/neighbours-star-matt-wilson-promises-a-darker-storyline-for-aaron-its-really-challenging/|title=Neighbours star Matt Wilson promises a darker storyline for Aaron: 'It's really challenging'|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=10 March 2016|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Will Stroude of ''[[Attitude (magazine)|Attitude]]'' labelled him "Ramsay Street's ravishing new resident" and "Mark and Tyler's mischievous middle brother".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://attitude.co.uk/meet-neighbours-new-gay-male-stripper-star-matt-wilson/|title=Meet 'Neighbours' new gay male stripper star, Matt Wilson|last=Stroude|first=Will|date=6 August 2015|work=[[Attitude (magazine)|Attitude]]|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron's arrival was named one of "the best bits of July" by a writer for the ''Inside Soap Yearbook 2016''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 2015|title=The best bits of July – Hot stuff!|journal=[[Inside Soap|Inside Soap Yearbook 2016]]|issue=1|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Langford, now writing for ''[[TVSource Magazine]]'', said that he was not a fan of Aaron's relationship with Nate. He found the pairing to be lacking in chemistry and "terribly boring". He added "I just don't believe a guy like Aaron would date a total downer like Nate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvsourcemagazine.com/2016/03/gays-lives-getting-busy-neighbours/2/|title=Gays of Our Lives: Getting Busy With 'The Neighbours'|last=D.

The '''Academies Act 2010''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It aims to make it possible for all publicly funded schools in England to become [[Academy (English school)|academies]], still publicly funded but with a vastly increased degree of autonomy in issues such as setting teachers' wages and diverging from the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]].&lt;ref name="BBCQ&amp;A"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/10161371.stm |title=Q&amp;A: Academies and free schools |date=26 May 2010 |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act is inspired by the [[Education in Sweden|Swedish free school system]].&lt;ref name="BBCQ&amp;A"/&gt; Journalist [[Mike Baker (journalist)|Mike Baker]] described it as a "recreation of [[grant-maintained school]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-10824069 |title=Gove's academies: 1980s idea rebranded? |first=Mike |last=Baker |date=31 July 2010 |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was among the first government bills introduced in the 55th United Kingdom Parliament by the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Conservative – Liberal Democrat coalition government]]. The bill was presented by [[Jonathan Hill, Baron Hill of Oareford]] in the [[House of Lords]], where it had its [[third reading]] on 13 July. It was read a third time in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on 26 July. The Act received [[Royal Assent]] on the following day and was brought into force in the most part on 29 July.

Angela Harrison, education correspondent for the [[BBC]], has said that the Act "could be the most radical overhaul of schools in England for a generation".&lt;ref name="BBC revolution"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/10159448.stm |title=Schools are promised an academies 'revolution' |date=26 May 2010 |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
An Academy may be set up under section 1 of the Act by virtue of an agreement between the [[Secretary of State for Education]] and any other person. Alternatively, maintained schools may be converted into academies by an Academy Order made under section 4 of the Act, provided that the governing body of the school has applied under section 3 or the school is eligible for intervention under sections 60-62 of the [[Education and Inspections Act 2006]]. Academies established under section 1 will be [[charitable organization|charities]] in addition to receiving funding from the central government.&lt;ref name="BBCQ&amp;A"/&gt; Academies will also be free to set their own curriculum, as long as it is "broad and balanced"&lt;ref name="BBCQ&amp;A"/&gt; meeting the standards set in section 78 of the [[Education Act 2002]]. The Act will only affect schools in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.gov.uk/academies/bill |title=Academies Bill |publisher=[[Department for Education]] |accessdate=17 July 2010 |quote=The Bill extends to England and Wales but only has application to England. While sections of the Bill do technically extend to Wales, the effect of the provisions will only permit an Academy to be established in England, so it will have no practical impact on, or application to, the organisation of schools in Wales.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100710154828/http://www.education.gov.uk/academies/bill| archivedate= 10 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial schools==
Prior to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]] there were 203 academies in England.&lt;ref name="BBCQ&amp;A"/&gt; After the election the new [[Secretary of State for Education|Education Secretary]] [[Michael Gove]] sent a letter to all publicly funded schools inviting them to become academies. Within three weeks, 70% of all outstanding [[secondary school]]s expressed interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/education/10338892.stm |title=Academy bids from 70% of top secondary schools - Gove |date=17 June 2010 |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 1,567 schools initially expressing interest, 828 were rated "outstanding" and could be fast-tracked into academies by September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/education/10413492.stm |title=Would-be academy list published |date=25 June 2010 |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of the list applicants for academy status by the ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]'' reported that the list was "dominated" by schools from [[middle class]] areas, particularly the [[Home Counties]]. For example, 12% of schools in [[Kent]] applied compared to less than 2% in [[Middlesbrough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web   | last = Vaughan  | first = Richard  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title =   Wealthy to dominate academies   | work =   | publisher = The Times Educational Supplement  | date = 2 July 2010   | url = http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6049283  | format =   | doi =   | accessdate = 4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A later list published by the Department for Education said a total of 1,907 schools had expressed an interest.

By 23 July 2010, 153 schools in England had applied for academy status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web   | last = Shepherd  | first = Jessica | last2 = Wintour | first2 = Patrick | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title =   Michael Gove's academy plan under fire as scale of demand emerges  | work =   | publisher = The Guardian | date = 29 July 2010   | url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/jul/29/michael-gove-academies-schools-claims  | format =   | doi =   | accessdate = 31 July 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100801033245/http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/jul/29/michael-gove-academies-schools-claims| archivedate= 1 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list included 12 [[faith schools]] and more than 20 [[grammar schools]]. Ultimately, 32 new academies (including seven primary schools) opened under the provisions of the Act in the autumn term of 2010. A further 110 schools (including 40 primaries) are planned to convert at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11151559 |title=First wave of 32 new-style academies open this week |first=Sean |last=Coughlan |date=1 September 2010 |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2011 a total of 407 primary and secondary schools with academy status existed (twice as many as before the 2010 election), with the 371 secondary academies representing 11% of the total number of secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-12121889 |date=6 January 2011 |title=Academy school numbers 'double' |first=Sean |last=Coughlan |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction and analysis==
[[Official Opposition (United Kingdom)|Opposition]] MPs and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] chair of the [[Education Select Committee]] [[Graham Stuart (UK politician)|Graham Stuart]] accused the government of "rushing" the bill through Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-10664722 |title=Academies Bill 'rushed through' claim |date=17 July 2010 |first=Angela |last=Harrison |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which the government replied that there was "ample time" to debate the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-10681793 |title='Ample time' for Academies Bill, says Michael Gove |date=19 July 2010 |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julian Glover (journalist)|Julian Glover]] said the "rush hides not the enormity but the thinness of the measure; opposition outrage enhancing the impression that something big must be under way" and the Act "concedes no new powers of any importance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation   | last =  Glover | first = Julian | author-link =    | last2 = | first2 =  | author2-link =   | title =Labour reacts to Michael Gove's academies bill like a childhood nightmare   | newspaper = The Guardian   | pages =   | date = 26 Jul 2010  | url =https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/26/labour-michael-gove-academies-bill-nightmare| accessdate = 5 August 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100729132039/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jul/26/labour-michael-gove-academies-bill-nightmare| archivedate= 29 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act aims to enshrine greater freedoms for schools given academy status.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6045171&lt;/ref&gt; Janet Daley says this will liberate schools from "monolithic local authority control"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation   | last =  Daley | first = Janet   | author-link =    | last2 = | first2 =  | author2-link =   | title = Michael Gove can earn the gratitude of a generation   | newspaper = Daily Telegraph   | pages =   | date = 24 Jul 2010  | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/janetdaley/7908439/Michael-Gove-can-earn-the-gratitude-of-a-generation.html | accessdate = 5 August 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100812105747/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/janetdaley/7908439/Michael-Gove-can-earn-the-gratitude-of-a-generation.html| archivedate= 12 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while journalist [[Toby Young]] said the Act will revitalise the goal of the existing academies system to provide an increased level of choice for parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation   | last =  Riddell | first = Mary   | author-link =    | last2 = Young   | first2 = Toby   | author2-link = Toby Young  | title = Mary Riddell v Toby Young: Education debate  | newspaper = Daily Telegraph   | pages =   | date = 17 June 2010  | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/7834774/Mary-Riddell-v-Toby-Young-Education-debate.html  | accessdate = 29 June 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100620014903/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/7834774/Mary-Riddell-v-Toby-Young-Education-debate.html| archivedate= 20 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Alan Smithers]] of the [[University of Buckingham]] said that the plan to increase autonomy for a select number of schools will be divisive and disadvantaged children would lose out.&lt;ref name="smithers"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/schools/alan-smithers-letting-schools-do-their-own-thing-is-a-recipe-for-chaos-2007722.html|title=Letting schools do their own thing is a recipe for chaos|publisher=The Independent|date=24 June 2010|accessdate=28 June 2010 | first=Alan | last=Smithers| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100627144035/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/schools/alan-smithers-letting-schools-do-their-own-thing-is-a-recipe-for-chaos-2007722.html| archivedate= 27 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters say that the "pupil premium" (which is not included within the Academies Act but will be brought forward in forthcoming legislation) will countermand this by allocating extra funds for schools with a greater intake of disadvantaged children.&lt;ref name="BBC revolution"/&gt;

Criticism of provisions in the Act have also come from the [[British Humanist Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web   | last =   | first =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Academies Bill will create irreversible religious divisions in the schools system  | work =   | publisher = British Humanist Society  | date =   | url = http://www.humanism.org.uk/news/view/563  | format =   | doi =   | accessdate = 29 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Local Government Information Unit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edexec.co.uk/news/1250/governing-bodies-should-have-community-representation/ |title=Governing bodies should have community representation |publisher=Edexec |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=28 June 2010 |first= |last= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308170125/http://www.edexec.co.uk/news/1250/governing-bodies-should-have-community-representation/ |archivedate=8 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat Education Association]]&lt;ref&gt;http://libdemeducationassociation.org.uk/news/000019/ldea_calls_on_mps_to_oppose_academy_bill.html&lt;/ref&gt; teachers' unions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web   | last =   | first =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title =  NUT News - Academies Bill – an undemocratic outrage! - Special Edition July 2010   | work =   | publisher = National Union of Teachers  | date =   | url = http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/11781| format =   | doi =   | accessdate = 5 August 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100716225414/http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/11781| archivedate= 16 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Amy Catanzano''' (born 1974) is an American poet from [[Boulder, CO]]. She is the author of ''Multiversal'', which won the PEN USA Literary Award in Poetry. [[Michael Palmer (poet)|Michael Palmer]] describes her work as "a poetic vision of multiple orders and multiple forms, of a fluid time set loose from linearity, and an open space that is motile and multidimensional."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fordham University Press|url=http://fordhampress.com/index.php/mutiversa-paperback.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009 she has published writing on a theory and practice called "quantum poetics," which explores the intersections of poetry and science, particularly physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerome Rothenberg: Poems and Poetics|url=http://poemsandpoetics.blogspot.com/2012/09/amy-catanzano-imaginary-present-poem.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her other interests include cross-genre texts and the literary avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wake Forest University Department of English Faculty website|url=http://college.wfu.edu/english/about-us/faculty/amy-catanzano/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13371">'''Andrew John Milner''' (born 9 September 1950) is a British-Australian cultural theorist and literary critic, Professor Emeritus of [[English studies|English]] and [[Comparative Literature]] at [[Monash University]] and Honorary Professor of English and Comparative Literary Studies at the [[University of Warwick]]. In 2013 he was [[Ludwig Hirschfeld Mack]] Visiting Professor of Australian Studies at the Institut für Englische Philologie, [[Freie Universität Berlin]].

Milner was born in [[Leeds]], UK, the son of John Milner and Dorothy Ibbotson. He was educated at [[Batley Grammar School]] and later at the [[London School of Economics]], where he studied [[sociology]]. He graduated with a B.Sc (Econ) degree, with honours in Sociology, in 1972 and a Ph.D. in the Sociology of Literature in 1977. He married [[Verity Burgmann]], the Australian political scientist and labour historian, in 1977. They have three sons.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in Australia 2009'', ed. Leanne Sullivan, Crown Content, Melbourne, 2009, p. 1480.&lt;/ref&gt;

Milner was politically active, by turn, in the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], the [[Labour Party Young Socialists]], the [[Vietnam Solidarity Campaign]], the International Socialists, the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)]] and, in Australia, People for Nuclear Disarmament.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, Andrew, ''The Road to St. Kilda Pier: George Orwell and the Politics of the Australian Left'', Stained Wattle Press, Sydney, 1984, p. ii.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 21st century he appears to have joined the [[Australian Greens]].&lt;ref&gt;Milner, Andrew, `Shock! Horror! Chattering Classes Vote Green!' Overland No. 166, 2002, pp. 95-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Milner's academic interests include literary and cultural theory, the sociology of literature,  [[utopia]], [[dystopia]] and [[science fiction]]. His work has been published in English in Australia,  India, the US and the UK and has been translated into [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Korean language|Korean]]. He first attracted attention for work, strongly influenced by [[Lucien Goldmann]], on the sociology of 17th-century literature. Subsequently he has become better known for his advocacy of [[Raymond Williams]]'s cultural materialism and for studies of utopian and dystopian science fiction. He also has a strong interest in the cultural sociology of [[Pierre Bourdieu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://profiles.arts.monash.edu.au/andrew-milner/ Andrew Milner Monash webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Andrew Milner began his academic career teaching Sociology at the London School of Economics in 1972.  He subsequently taught in Sociology at [[Goldsmiths, University of London]]; in Cultural Studies at the [[University of Leeds]]; and in the Centre for Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies at Monash University, where he was appointed to a chair in 2000. He was Director of the Centre 2001-2003 and Deputy Director 2004-2010. When the University merged its programs in Comparative Literature and English in January 2012 he became Professor of English and Comparative Literature. He retired in 2013 and was appointed Professor Emeritus before proceeding to a position in English at the Freie Universität Berlin. He also held visiting appointments in the Centre for Philosophy and Literature at the University of Warwick, the Theory, Culture and Society Centre at [[Nottingham Trent University]], the School of English at the [[University of Liverpool]] and the Department of English and Comparative Literary Studies at the University of Warwick.

==Sociology of literature==
Milner’s first book, ''John Milton and the English Revolution'', was an application of Goldmann’s 'genetic structuralist' [[sociology of literature]] to the political, philosophical and poetical writings of [[John Milton]], the great poet of the [[English Revolution]]. It argued that the seventeenth-century revolutionary crisis had witnessed the creation and subsequent destruction of a rationalist world vision, which found political expression in the political practice of 'Independency'. A detailed analysis of ''Paradise Lost'', ''Paradise Regained'' and ''Samson Agonistes'' interpreted the poems as articulating distinct and separate responses to the problem of defeat, whether actual or potential, and to the triumph of unreason over reason. ''Literature, Culture and Society'' was published in two editions, the first in 1996 and the second, very substantially revised, in 2005. Both develop a substantive account of the capitalist literary mode of production, focussing on technologies of mechanical reproduction and social relations of commodification. The differences between editions are evidence of Milner’s growing interest in comparative literature and science fiction studies. Two of the additional case-studies in the second edition reflect both interests, a third the latter alone.

==Cultural materialism==
Milner’s concern with Williams’s theoretical legacy inspired ''Cultural Materialism'', published in 1993, and ''Re-Imagining Cultural Studies'', published in 2002. Both traced the continuing influence on literary and cultural studies of the kinds of [[cultural materialism (cultural studies)|cultural materialism]] developed by Williams and his successors. They also stressed the differences between Williams and [[Richard Hoggart]], arguing that the label 'culturalism' could not properly be applied to both. Milner argued that Williams had stood in an essentially analogous relation to the British 'culturalist' tradition as Bourdieu and [[Michel Foucault]] to French structuralism and [[Jürgen Habermas]] to German critical theory. Cultural materialism was therefore best understood, not as culturalist, but rather as positively 'post-culturalist'. In 2010 Milner published, under the title ''Tenses of Imagination'', an edited collection of Williams’s writings on [[utopia]], [[dystopia]] and [[science fiction]].

==Science fiction==
''Locating Science Fiction'' is arguably Milner’s most important, potentially paradigm-shifting, book. Academic literary criticism had tended to locate science fiction primarily in relation to the older genre of utopia; fan criticism primarily in relation to [[fantasy]] and science fiction in other media, especially film and television; popular fiction studies primarily in relation to such contemporary genres as the [[romance novel]] and the thriller. Milner’s book relocates science fiction in relation not only to these other genres and media, but also to the historical and geographic contexts of its emergence and development. ''Locating Science Fiction'' sought to move science fiction theory and criticism away from the prescriptively abstract dialectics of cognition and estrangement associated with [[Fredric Jameson]] and [[Darko Suvin]], and towards an empirically grounded understanding of what is actually a messy amalgam of texts, practices and artefacts. Inspired by Williams, Bourdieu and [[Franco Moretti]]’s application of world systems theory to literary studies, it drew on the disciplinary competences of comparative literature, cultural studies, critical theory and sociology to produce a powerfully distinctive mode of analysis, engagement and argument. The concluding chapter is preoccupied with environmentalist thematics occasioned by Milner’s growing interest in Green politics.

'''ArtAbilitation''' is an international conference platform for people with [[disability|disabilities]] and a movement that started in 2006 as coined/originated by Anthony (aka Tony) Brooks. The concept was realized as an international conference, workshop series, and symposium, and was inaugurated in [[Esbjerg, Denmark]], in September 2006 when supporting the ICDVRAT&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icdvrat.rdg.ac.uk|title=ICDVRAT - International Conference Series on Disability, Virtual Reality and Associated Technologies|author=Paul Sharkey|website=Icdvrat.rdg.ac.uk|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in celebrating its tenth anniversary. Selected authors from this inaugural event published their papers in the Routledge International Journal Digital Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~content=g778864938~db=all|title=Editorial: ArtAbilitation|author=Tony Brooks|pages=65-68|date=18 May 2007|website=Informaworld.com|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a778860902~db=all~order=page|journal=

The events of ICDVRAT &amp; ArtAbilitation 2006 were reported in the International Journal for [[Virtual reality|Virtual Reality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijvr.org/reports%20and%20experts/report_ICDVRAT.pdf International Journal for Virtual Reality] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119232458/http://www.ijvr.org/reports%20and%20experts/report_ICDVRAT.pdf |date=November 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the second ArtAbilitation conference supported the 17th International Conference for [[Artificial reality|Artificial Reality]] &amp; Telexistence (ICAT). ICAT is the oldest international conference on Virtual Reality and the hosting in Esbjerg, Denmark. This was the first time the event was held outside the [[Asia Pacific]] region. ICAT is organised by the Virtual Reality Society of Japan (VRSJ). ICAT 2006 was held at [[Zhejiang University of Technology]] in China.  Archives of ICAT2007 are online at IEEE site. The first international symposium ‘Ludic Engagement Designs for All’ supported.{{Clarify|date=October 2010}}

The 3rd ArtAbilitation Conference was held alongside ICDVRAT 2008 in [[Maia, Portugal]], on September 8 through 10th. A special session on music was hosted at [[Casa da Música|Casa da Musica]], Porto, Portugal, on 11 September. This was followed by the ''2nd International Congress on Art, Brain and Languages'', hosted in Casa da Musica in Porto on 11 and 12 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk/ABL_Programme.pdf |title=2nd International Congress on Art, Brain &amp; languages |website=Cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk|accessdate=October 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference combines various areas of knowledge such as [[Neuropsychology]], [[Musicology|Musical Sciences]], [[Theatre|Theatrical Arts]], [[Art therapy|Art Therapy]], and [[Linguistics]]. It aims for a holistic, interdisciplinary approach to education, disability, and rehabilitation. It intends to question how the inter-related practice and processing of different types of language (musical, psychomotor, verbal, technological, and aesthetic) can intervene in education and disability (motor, verbal or mental).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

'''CIETC''' is an acronym for the '''Central Iowa Employment and Training Consortium'''. CIETC is a public agency formed in an agreement among the City of [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], and the surrounding counties of [[Boone County, Iowa|Boone]], [[Dallas County, Iowa|Dallas]], [[Jasper County, Iowa|Jasper]], [[Madison County, Iowa|Madison]], [[Marion County, Iowa|Marion]], [[Polk County, Iowa|Polk]], [[Story County, Iowa|Story]] and [[Warren County, Iowa|Warren]].

The agency was the subject of local media coverage and controversy when the compensation plans for executives at CIETC were disclosed.

== Organization ==

Formed under Chapter 25E of the Iowa Code, CIETC is governed by a Board of Directors, composed of representatives appointed by the Mayor or Chairperson of each participating entity and with approval by the respective Council or Board of Supervisors. Des Moines appoints three representatives, whereas Polk County has four representatives, and each remaining community has one representative each.

CIETC created an agreement with the 11th Regional Workforce Investment Board (RWIB) to provide employment and training services. CIETC administers three programs: Promise Jobs, WIA,{{clarify|date=July 2014}} and [[Welfare-to-work]].

=== Promise Jobs ===

Promise Jobs is designed to provide training and increase the availability of employment opportunities to recipients of the Family Investment Program (FIP) as part of the Family Investment Agreement (FIA). The program is funded by the [[U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services]] (DHHS) through the [[Temporary Assistance to Needy Families]] (TANF) program. Promise Jobs is administered by CIETC, [[Iowa Workforce Development]] and DHHS.

== Controversy ==

On March 31, 2006, David A. Vaudt from the Auditor's Office for the State of Iowa released a report concerning an investigation of misuse of federal and state funds to pay excessive salaries and bonuses to three executive members at CIETC.

'''Carol Fowler Durham''' ({{birth date |1954|09|08}}) is an [[United States|American]] [[Professor|Clinical Professor of Nursing]] and [[Doctor of Education]] who is known as a leader in the fields of Healthcare Quality and Safety, [[nursing education]], [[interprofessional education]], and [[medical simulation]].

Durham was inducted as a Fellow of the [[National League for Nursing]] Academy of Nursing Education in 2009 and inducted as a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Nursing]] in 2013.

Durham is a professor and Director of the Education-Innovation-Simulation Learning Environment (EISLE) for the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] School of Nursing.

She is also a past president of the International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation and Learning and the [[Sigma Theta Tau]] Alpha Alpha Chapter. As of 2016, Durham also serves on the board of directors for the Global Network for Simulation in Healthcare.

==Background==
Durham was born on {{birth date |1954|09|08}} in [[Laurinburg, North Carolina]] to Henry and Marie Fowler. She was the oldest of two children and they grew up in [[Rockfish, North Carolina]].

Durham’s father died when she was 13 years old after eight years with [[Scleroderma]]. He died in the VA Hospital in [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]] and Durham was inspired by the nurses who provided care to her father. That is what lead to her interest in pursuing a career in nursing.

==Early education and career==
Durham attended [[Hoke County High School]] in [[Raeford, NC]] where she graduated in 1972.

In 1976, Durham graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing]] from [[Western Carolina University]] in [[Cullowhee, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=DurhamCV&gt;{{cite journal |author=Durham, Carol F |title=Durham CV |url=http://www.unc.edu/~cdurham/cv.html |accessdate=2017-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following graduation, Durham worked as a staff nurse at CJ Harris Hospital in [[Sylva, North Carolina]]. Durham moved to [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] where she worked as a [[Coronary Care Unit]] nurse at [[Rex Hospital]].&lt;ref name=DurhamCV/&gt;

Durham worked as a research data technician at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] School of Nursing while working on her [[Master of Science in Nursing]].&lt;ref name=DurhamCV/&gt; Following her graduation in 1982, Durham began as an instructor in the UNC School of Nursing while working in [[Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation|cardiac rehabilitation]] and [[Patient education|patient educator]] at the non-profit Orange Cardiovascular Foundation.&lt;ref name=DurhamCV/&gt;

==Simulation==
While at UNC, Durham was a teaching assistant in the skills lab in 1981.&lt;ref name=DurhamCV/&gt; The skills labs at UNC were renamed in 1996 under Durham's direction.&lt;ref name=CarolinaRN2006&gt;{{cite journal |title=CERC: Clinical Education &amp; Resource Center |date=2006 |journal=Carolina Nursing Magazine |url=http://doczz.net/doc/1815635/carolina-nursing--fall-2006---school-of-nursing }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lab was once again renamed to become the School of Nursing Education-Innovation-Simulation Learning Environment (EISLE) where Durham has continued to grow educational methodologies beyond traditional [[nursing education]] into [[interprofessional education]] and [[medical simulation]].

Durham is an internationally recognized expert in simulation for quality improvement, education, and assessment with simulation methodologies.&lt;ref name=MedSimMag&gt;{{cite journal |title=Carol F Durham |url=https://www.healthcaretrainingandeducation.com/nursing/nurse-education-carol-durham/ |journal=Medical Training Magazine |year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OermannPodcast&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Oermann, Marilyn |title=Carol Durham Shares Views about Simulation and Nurse Educator as Leader |journal=Nurse Educator Online |url=http://journals.lww.com/nurseeducatoronline/Pages/podcastepisodes.aspx?podcastid=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durham has been a member of the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation|RWJF]]s Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) project since 2005, when she developed simulation-based educational activities to reflect cutting-edge [[pedagogy]].&lt;ref name=QSENfaculty&gt;{{cite web |title=QSEN Faculty |publisher=Quality and Safety Education for Nurses Project |url=http://qsen.org/about-qsen/qsen-faculty/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AHRQ_QSEN2017&gt;{{cite journal |title=Infusing Quality and Safety Education for Nurses into Your Curriculum: A Workshop Funded by a grant from The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. |date=2017-03-22 |url=http://www.nursinglibrary.org/vhl/handle/10755/621354 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Durham completed the [[Doctor of Education]] program at [[North Carolina State University]] concentrating on adult and higher education.

The [[National League for Nursing]] invited Durham to a "Debriefing Strategic Think Tank" in 2014 to provide guidance for "Debriefing Across the Curriculum".&lt;ref name=debrief2016&gt;{{cite web |title=NLN and INACSL Publish Vision for Debriefing Across the Curriculum |date=2016-06-09 |url=http://www.nln.org/newsroom/news-releases/news-release/2015/06/09/nln-and-inacsl-publish-vision-for-debriefing-across-the-curriculum }}&lt;/ref&gt; This event was held in collaboration with International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation and Learning.&lt;ref name=debrief2016/&gt;

In 2015, Durham was invited by the [[National Council of State Boards of Nursing]] (NCSBN) to join the eight member task force that developed simulation guidelines for state boards of nursing in response to the NCSBN Simulation Study.&lt;ref name=NCSBNinvite&gt;{{Cite journal|title=NCSBN invites Carol Durham to join simulation task force |date=2015-04-13 |journal=UNC School of Nursing |url=http://nursing.unc.edu/national_simulation_task_force/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The North Carolina [[Area Health Education Centers Program|AHEC]] sponsored a Faculty Development Institute with Drs. Durham and Gwen Sherwood providing webinars to improving continuing interprofessional education in 2015.&lt;ref name=NC_AHEC_2015&gt;{{cite web |title=C.I.P.E. Faculty Development Institute |publisher=NC AHEC |url=http://www.aheconnect.com/cipe/faculty1.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Durham’s team continued their interprofessional work with [[North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine]]. The team’s [[One Health]] case submission was recognized in a national competition by the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC) and Association for Prevention Teaching and Research.&lt;ref name=OneHealth2016&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brewer E, Rost E, Cozart R, Davidson G, Durham C, [[Gene Hobbs|Hobbs GW]], Joyner BL, Scolaro KL. |title=A Veteran and His Dog. |journal=Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC)/ Association for Prevention Teaching and Research (APTR) One Health Interprofessional Education Initiative.

'''Children's museums''' are institutions that provide exhibits and programs to stimulate [[informal learning]] experiences for [[children]]. In contrast with traditional [[museum]]s that typically have a hands-off policy regarding exhibits, children's museums feature interactive exhibits that are designed to be manipulated by children. The theory behind such exhibits is that activity can be as educational as instruction, especially in early childhood. Most children's museums are [[nonprofit]] organizations, and many are run by [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s or by very small professional staffs.&lt;ref name="ACM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrensmuseums.org/ |title=The Association of Children's Museums website |publisher=Childrensmuseums.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International professional organizations of children's museums include the [[Association of Children's Museums]] (ACM), which was formed in 1962 as the American Association of Youth Museums (AAYM) and in 2007 counted 341 member institutions in 23 countries,&lt;ref name="ACM" /&gt; and The Hands On! Europe Association of Children's Museum (HO!E), established in 1994, with member institutions in 34 countries as of 2007.&lt;ref name="HO!E"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hands-on-europe.net/ |title=Hands On! Europe website |publisher=Hands-on-europe.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many museums that are members of ACM offer reciprocal memberships, allowing members of one museum to visit all the others for free.

==History==
[[File:HoustonChildrenMuseum.JPG|thumb|[[Children's Museum of Houston]]]]

The first children's museum in the world was the [[Brooklyn Children's Museum]], founded in 1899.  The next five in order of their founding were:

* [[Boston Children's Museum]] (1913)&lt;ref name="Boston"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonkids.org/ |title=Boston Children's Museum |publisher=Bostonkids.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Detroit]] Children's Museum (1917)&lt;ref name="CMDet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitchildrensmuseum.org/ |title=Detroit Children's Museum |publisher=Detroitchildrensmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] (1925)&lt;ref name="CMIndy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrensmuseum.org/ |title=The Indianapolis Children's Museum |publisher=Childrensmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; – according to the ACM, this is the world's largest children's museum.&lt;ref name="ACM" /&gt;
* [[The Children's Museum, Connecticut|The Children's Museum (West Hartford, CT)]] (1927)&lt;ref name="Hartford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thechildrensmuseumct.org/ |title=The Children's Museum |publisher=Thechildrensmuseumct.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Duluth Children's Museum]] (1930)&lt;ref name="Duluth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duluthchildrensmuseum.org/ |title=Duluth Children's Museum |publisher=Duluthchildrensmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1975, there were approximately 38 children's museums in the United States. An additional 80 institutions opened between 1976 and 1990, and more than 130 opened between 1990 and 2007.&lt;ref name="ACM" /&gt; As of 2007, ACM estimated that there were approximately 80 children's museums in the planning phase.

The children's museum concept has spread worldwide from the United States. Le Musée des Enfants in [[Brussels]] was started in 1978, inspired by Boston Children's Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museedesenfants.be/ |title=Le Musée des Enfants |publisher=Museedesenfants.be |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boston museum also inspired the [[Museo Pambata]] in [[Manila]], which opened in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museopambata.org/ |title=Museo Pambata |publisher=Museo Pambata |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Children's Museum of Caracas]], Venezuela, became Latin America's first museum for children when it opened in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maravillosarealidad.com/ |title=Children's Museum of Caracas |publisher=Maravillosarealidad.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Children's Museum of Bogotá]], Colombia, followed it in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museodelosninos.org.co/ |title=Children's Museum of Bogotá |publisher=Museodelosninos.org.co |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eureka!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4283">The '''Dataverse''' is an open source web application to share, preserve, cite, explore and analyze research data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january11/crosas/01crosas.html|title=The Dataverse Network: An Open-Source Application for Sharing, Discovering and Preserving Data|last=Crosas|first=M.|work=D-Lib Magazine|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Project|url=http://dataverse.org/about/|website=Dataverse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers, data authors, publishers, data distributors, and affiliated institutions all receive appropriate credit via a data citation with a persistent identifier (e.g., DOI, or Handle).

A Dataverse repository hosts multiple dataverses. Each dataverse contains dataset(s) or other dataverses, and each dataset contains descriptive metadata and data files (including documentation and code that accompany the data). 

== The Dataverse Project Background ==
The Dataverse Project is housed, and developed by the Dataverse Team at the [[Institute for Quantitative Social Science]] (IQSS) at [[Harvard University]]. Coding of the Dataverse (previously known as Dataverse Network) software began in 2006 under the leadership of [[Mercè Crosas]] and [[Gary King (political scientist)|Gary King]]. The earlier Virtual Data Center (VDC) project, which spanned 1999-2006, was organized by [[Micah Altman]], Gary King, and [[Sidney Verba]] as a collaboration between the Harvard-MIT Data Center (now part of IQSS) and the [[Harvard University Library]].  Precursors to the VDC date to 1987, comprising such entities as a stand-alone software guide to local data, preweb software, and tools to transfer cataloging information by FTP to other sites across campus automatically at designated times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Project|url=http://dataverse.org/about/|work=About the Project|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Harvard Dataverse ==
A collaboration with the Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS), the [[Harvard Library]], and Harvard University Information Technology (HUIT): the Harvard Dataverse is a repository for sharing, citing, analyzing, and preserving research data; open to all scientific data from all disciplines worldwide.

== Dataverse Installations Around the World ==
There are several other Dataverse repositories installed in Universities and organizations around the world. Here is a list of some Dataverse repositories:
*Odum Institute
*Dutch Universities (DANS)
*[[Fudan University]]
*[[University of Alberta]] Libraries
*Department of Cross Cultural and Regional Studies, [[University of Copenhagen]] (ToRS)
*ABACUS - British Columbia Research Libraries' Data Services
*Scholars Portal - [[Ontario Council of University Libraries]] (OCUL)
*HeiDATA - [[Heidelberg University]]
*DataverseNO (Norwegian universities)

==APIs and Interoperability==
The Dataverse currently has multiple open APIs available, which allow for searching, depositing and accessing data.

'''David Lawrence Ramsey III''' (born September 3, 1960) is an American businessman and author.

==Biography==
Ramsey was born and raised in [[Antioch, Tennessee]]. He was a 1982 graduate of the College of Business Administration at [[University of Tennessee, Knoxville]] with a degree in Finance and Real Estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is Dave Ramsey?|url=https://www.daveramsey.com/pr/who-is/|publisher=Dave Ramsey|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a real estate investor, doing business as  Ramsey Investments, Inc., he built a rental real estate portfolio worth more than $4 million by 1986.&lt;ref name="GRI"&gt;{{cite book | title=Financial Peace Revisited| last=Ramsey| first=Dave|author2=Sharon Ramsey| year=2003| page=325| publisher=Viking Penguin| location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England| id=0-670-03208-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank that was financing his real estate was sold to a larger bank who demanded immediate repayment on the loans. He was unable to pay, and eventually filed bankruptcy in September 1988.

After recovering financially, Ramsey began counseling couples at his local church. He attended workshops and seminars on consumer financial problems. Ramsey developed a set of lessons and materials based partially on his own experience and partially on works and teachings by [[Larry Burkett]], Ron Blue and Art Williams of the [[Arthur L. Williams Jr.|A.L. Williams]] company, now [[Primerica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oneplace.com/Ministries/Focus_on_the_Family/Archives.asp?bcd=2008-4-3|title=Broadcast Archives - Jim Daly, Focus on the Family|website=oneplace.com|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 he wrote his first book, ''Financial Peace''.&lt;ref name="GRI" /&gt;

Ramsey is a devout [[Christian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=20030331&amp;id=VLtNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oQ4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6793,8240090|title=Ocala Star-Banner - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He  has been married to his wife, Sharon, for over 30 years. They have three children, and  reside in [[Franklin, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="GRI" /&gt;

== Media ==
Ramsey's [[Radio syndication|syndicated]] radio program, ''[[The Dave Ramsey Show (radio program)|The Dave Ramsey Show]]'', is heard on more than 500 radio stations throughout the United States and Canada, in [[podcast]] format, on [[IHeartRadio]], the Dave Ramsey Show [[iOS]] application, live on [[YouTube]], as well as live audio and video on DaveRamsey.com.&lt;ref name="Axia Interview: Blake Thompson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.axiaaudio.com/interviews/features/ramsey.htm|title=Axia Interview with Blake Thompson, producer of The Dave Ramsey Show|publisher=www.axiaaudio.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313071456/http://www.axiaaudio.com/interviews/features/ramsey.htm|archivedate=March 13, 2007|deadurl=yes|accessdate=December 3, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.daveramsey.com/show/home/ Watch and Listen to the Dave Ramsey Show]". daveramsey.com. Retrieved September 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He has written numerous books including five [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestsellers]]. His books and broadcasts advocate a fiscally disciplined approach to personal and household finances, including the strict management of debt, and often feature a [[Christian]] perspective. Ramsey was named the 2009 [[NAB Marconi Radio Awards|Marconi Award]] winner for Network/Syndicated Personality of the Year,&lt;ref name="2009 Marconi Award winners"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nab.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Press_Releases1&amp;CONTENTID=14966&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm|title=2009 NAB MARCONI RADIO AWARD WINNERS ANNOUNCED}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was inducted into the [[National Radio Hall of Fame]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiohof.org/dave%20ramsey.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

His company, The Lampo Group, Inc., headquartered in [[Brentwood, Tennessee]], oversees six divisions geared toward financial education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Lampo-Group-Dave-Ramsey-EI_IE355423.11,34.htm|title=Working at Lampo Group, Dave Ramsey|website=Glassdoor|accessdate=October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/nashville/business-reviews/financial-services/the-lampo-group-in-brentwood-tn-29003110|title=The Lampo Group, Inc.

Ramsey has been featured on many media outlets including ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', ''[[60 Minutes]]'', and ''[[The Early Show]]''. He recorded a pilot and six unaired episodes of ''The Dave Ramsey Project''&lt;ref name="DaveGospel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/the-gospel-according-to-dave/Content?oid=1194744|title=The Gospel According to Dave|last=Drury|first=Susan|date=May 31, 2007|newspaper=[[Nashville Scene]]|accessdate=July 16, 2007|publisher=|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for CBS.

{{Main|The Dave Ramsey Show (radio program)|The Dave Ramsey Show (TV program)}}

Twenty-five years ago, Ramsey started his radio career by co-hosting  ''The Money Game'' with Roy Matlock of Primerica. Over time, this local show on one radio station in Nashville turned into ''The Dave Ramsey Show.'' With a combined listenership of over 12 million weekly, the show is available on more than 575 radio stations and other channels.   In 2007, the [[Fox Business Network]] launched a television show under the same title, but canceled the show in June 2010.

In 1994, he hired Russ Carroll, Ramsey's lead financial counselor, and together they began teaching the first Financial Peace University classes on overhead projectors.&lt;ref name="Company History" /&gt; Between 1999 and 2004, The Lampo Group grew from 18 to 105 team members.  There are currently over 500 team members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact sheet|url=https://www.daveramsey.com/pr/fact-sheet/|website=DaveRamsey.com|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial Peace University ===
Ramsey is  the creator of Financial Peace University, a biblically based training series for adults that integrates video teaching, class discussions, and small group activities.&lt;ref name="FPNG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daveramsey.com/etc/cms/index.cfm?intContentID=6772 |title=THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY LEARN LIFES FINANCIAL LESSONS FROM DAVE RAMSEY |accessdate=March 21, 2007 |publisher=DaveRamsey.com |year=2007 |author=Beth Tallent |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515231859/http://www.daveramsey.com/etc/cms/index.cfm?intContentID=6772 |archivedate=May 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he  launched a followup program, The Legacy Journey. This course is a biblically based training series for adults  focused on "what's next?" after getting out of debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daveramsey.com/legacy/home/ "The Legacy Journey by Dave Ramsey".] daveramsey.com. Retrieved July 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===EntreLeadership===
Ramsey coined the word EntreLeadership to describe the responsibilities of a small business owner as an entrepreneur, and used it as the name of a small business conference. Ramsey released the book ''EntreLeadership'' in 2011. It made the New York Times Bestseller's list nearly overnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daveramsey.com/entreleadership/home/ |title=EntreLeadership |publisher=daveramsey.com |accessdate=October 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== EveryDollar ===
EveryDollar is a budgeting tool that was created by Ramsey Solutions, available online, on iOS, and Android. Users list all sources of income and they give every dollar a name for the month, based on [[zero-based budgeting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Zero-Based Budget: What and Why|url = http://www.daveramsey.com/blog/zero-based-budget-what-why|website = www.daveramsey.com|accessdate = December 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial advice==
Ramsey supports the [[debt snowball method]], where debtors pay off their lowest balance debt first instead of paying off their highest interest rate debt first. While this approach has been criticized by some, such as [[NerdWallet.com]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Dave Ramsey’s Debt Snowball is Bad Financial Advice|url=http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/money-nerd/getting-out-of-debt/dave-ramseys-debt-snowball-bad-financial-advice/|publisher=[[NerdWallet.com]]|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; research done by the [[Kellogg School of Management]] has found that the debt snowball method is generally effective. The small victories give debtors motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tuttle |first=Brad |url=http://moneyland.time.com/2012/08/16/the-verdict-is-in-tackle-smaller-debts-first/ |title=Paying Off Credit Card Debt: What is the Best Approach? |work=Moneyland.time.com |date=August 16, 2012 |accessdate=October 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1509/jmr.11.0272 | volume=49 | title=Can Small Victories Help Win the War?

Ramsey claims that investors can get a 12% [[Annual growth %|average annual return]], which is the rate he uses in financial analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramsey|first1=Dave|title=The 12% Reality: Can you really get a 12% return on your mutual fund investments?|url=http://www.daveramsey.com/article/the-12-reality/lifeandmoney_investing/#a8|publisher=Dave Ramsey|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ann Carrns responded that using an average annual return rate is misleading and that the [[compound annual growth rate]] is a better measurement for planning investments.&lt;ref name=carrns&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carrns|first1=Ann|title=Dave Ramsey’s 12% Solution|url=http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/dave-ramseys-12-solution/|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=October 23, 2014|date=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helaine Olen, author of the book "Pound Foolish: Exposing the Dark Side of the Personal Finance Industry" quoted in ''[[Yahoo Finance]]'' stated that a 12% return is unrealistically high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Korn|first1=Morgan|title=Don’t Get Your Money Advice from Suze Orman, Dave Ramsey: Pound Foolish Author|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/don-t-money-advice-suze-orman-dave-ramsey-122754956.html|publisher=[[Yahoo Finance]]|date=January 14, 2013|accessdate=October 23, 2014|quote=Equities are extremely volatile and rarely provide the 12% annual return that Orman and Dave Ramsey tout for people looking to quadruple their income, Olen adds.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Motley Fool]], following Ramsey's calculations could cause individuals to be seriously under-invested for retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stoffel|first1=Brian|title=Dangerous Retirement Planning Advice From Financial Guru Dave Ramsey|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/06/03/dangerous-retirement-planning-advice-from-financia.aspx|publisher=[[The Motley Fool]]|accessdate=October 23, 2014|quote=Let's take the case of a 25-year-old who is going to start saving today, and wants to retire when he's 65 with $1 million -- just as Ramsey mentioned on his Twitter page. If that investor assumes he'll make a 12% return per year on his investments, he'll need to save $97 per month. If, however, he assumes his return will be 6.7% -- the S&amp;P 500's CAGR while factoring in inflation, which Ramsey claims to do -- that number jumps to $422 per month. Think about that: $97 per month versus $422.  That's an enormous difference! For the hapless investor who saved $97 per month but experienced a more-normal 6.7% return per year, he will be over $770,000 -- or 77% -- short of his investment goal. I'm not sure why Ramsey harps on this 12% figure while not offering any solid numbers to back it up. His followers would be well served to dial down their assumptions before adjusting their retirement planning process. Dave Ramsey is a fake, and his show is clearly scripted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsey recommends investors to hold all their investments in stock mutual funds, but their volatility increases risk compared to bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Salmon|first1=Felix|last2=Poppick|first2=Susie|title=Save like Dave Ramsey… Just Don’t Invest Like Him|url=http://time.com/money/2794698/save-like-dave-ramsey-just-dont-invest-like-him/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=October 23, 2014|date=September 26, 2013|quote=More consequentially, Ramsey advocates a portfolio of only stock funds, with no bonds. (He does say that those with low risk tolerance might add a balanced fund, which includes some bonds as well as stocks.) Given the volatility of stocks, that’s aggressive advice, to say the least.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recommends that retirees withdraw 8% of their retirement fund each year, contrary to the generally recommended 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramsey|first1=Dave|title=How to Wreck Your Nest Egg at Retirement: Things you should and shouldn’t do once you retire|url=http://www.daveramsey.com/article/how-to-wreck-your-nest-egg-at-retirement/lifeandmoney_investing/|publisher=Dave Ramsey|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Ramsey received criticism on social media sites for building a large and lavish home. He responded that the cost of the home was paid in cash, represented a very low percentage of his net worth, and had already been used to host many fundraisers for ministries, charities and community causes.&lt;ref name="Response to House Criticism"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Leah Marieann Klett|title=Dave Ramsey Offers Powerful, Biblically Sound Response to Criticism over His Multi-Million Dollar Home|url=http://www.gospelherald.com/articles/54676/20150310/dave-ramsey-offers-powerful-biblically-sound-response-to-criticism-over-his-multi-million-dollar-home.htm|website=The Gospel Herald|accessdate=March 5, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306021332/http://www.gospelherald.com/articles/54676/20150310/dave-ramsey-offers-powerful-biblically-sound-response-to-criticism-over-his-multi-million-dollar-home.htm|archivedate=March 6, 2016|date=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Education in North Korea''' is [[state school|universal and state-funded]] schooling by the [[Government of North Korea|government]]. The self-reported national [[literacy rate]] for citizens at age of 15 and older is 100 percent (approx.).&lt;ref name="loc-nk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/tableView.aspx National adult literacy rates (15+), youth literacy rates (15-24) and elderly literacy rates (65+) Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716104117/http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/tableView.aspx |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children go through one year of kindergarten, four years of primary education, six years of secondary education, and then on to university.

In 1988 the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) reported that [[North Korea]] had 35,000 preprimary, 59,000 primary, 111,000 secondary, 23,000 college and university, and 4,000 other postsecondary teachers.&lt;ref name="loc-nk"&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/North_Korea.pdf Library of Congress country study], see p. 7 for Education and Literacy ( {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6FXLe34aH?url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/North_Korea.pdf |date=March 31, 2013 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Practising a torch march on Kim il-sung square 04.JPG|thumb|300px|Children make the emblem of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] as they practice for a torch march on [[Kim Il-sung Square]] in Pyongyang, 2012.]]

Formal education has played a central role in the social and cultural development of both traditional Korea and contemporary North Korea. During the Joseon Dynasty, the royal court established a system of schools that taught Confucian subjects in the provinces as well as in four central secondary schools in the capital. There was no state-supported system of primary education.

During the 15th century, state-supported schools declined in quality and were supplanted in importance by private academies, the seowon, centers of a Neo-Confucian revival in the 16th century. Higher education was provided by the Seonggyungwan, the Confucian national university, in Seoul. Its enrollment was limited to 200 students who had passed the lower civil-service examinations and were preparing for the highest examinations.

The late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed major educational changes. The seowon were abolished by the central government. Christian missionaries established modern schools that taught Western curricula. Among them was the first school for women, Ehwa Woman's University, established by American Methodist missionaries as a primary school in Seoul in 1886. During the last years of the dynasty, as many as 3,000 private schools that taught modern subjects to both sexes were founded by missionaries and others. Most of these schools were concentrated in the northern part of Korea.[3]

After Japan annexed Korea in 1910, the colonial regime established an educational system with two goals: to give Koreans a minimal education designed to train them for subordinate roles in a modern economy and make them loyal subjects of the emperor; and to provide a higher-quality education for Japanese expatriates who had settled in large numbers on the Korean Peninsula.[3]

The Japanese invested more resources in the latter, and opportunities for Koreans were severely limited. A state university modeled on Tokyo Imperial University was established in Seoul in 1923, but the number of Koreans allowed to study there never exceeded 40 percent of its enrollment; the rest of its students were Japanese. Private universities, including those established by missionaries such as Sungsil College in Pyongyang and Chosun Christian College in Seoul, provided other opportunities for Koreans desiring higher education.[3]

After the establishment of North Korea, an education system modeled largely on that of the Soviet Union was established. According to North Korean sources, at the time of North Korea's establishment, two-thirds of school-age children did not attend primary school, and most adults, numbering 2.3 million, were illiterate. In 1950, primary education became compulsory for children. The outbreak of the Korean War, however, delayed attainment of this goal; universal primary education was not achieved until 1956. By 1958 North Korean sources claimed that seven-year compulsory primary and secondary education had been implemented.[4]

In 1959 "state-financed universal education" was introduced in all schools; not only instruction and educational facilities, but also textbooks, uniforms, and room and board are provided to students without charge. By 1967 nine years of education became compulsory. In 1975 the compulsory eleven-year education system, which includes one year of preschool education and ten years of primary and secondary education, was implemented; that system remains in effect as of 1993. According to a 1983 speech given by Kim Il Sung to education ministers of nonaligned countries in Pyongyang, universal, compulsory higher education was to be introduced "in the near future."At that time, students had no school expenses; the state paid for the education of almost half of at the time North Korea's population of 18.9 million.[4]

In 2012 Chief Kim Jong Un has advocated that North Korea should expand its compulsory education from 11 years to 12 years. According to Joong Ang News in North Korea, a bill to expand its compulsory education was passed last September 2012. Prior to this reformation, North Korea had eleven years of free education system which consisted of one year of kindergarten, four years of elementary school and six years of secondary school prior to college. After reformation, now, it resembles education system in South Korea which consists of six years of elementary school, three years of middle school and three years of high school.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130222010247/http://www.goodnewspress.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=3020 북한 교육제도 개혁, 12년제 의무교육 실시 - 데일리투머로우].

==Primary and secondary education==
[[File:DPRK Primary School.JPG|thumb|300px|A primary school.]]

In the early 1990s, the compulsory primary and secondary education system was divided into one year of kindergarten, four years of primary school (people's school) for ages six to nine, and six years of senior middle school (secondary school) for ages ten to fifteen. There are two years of kindergarten, for children aged four to six, only the second year (upper level kindergarten) is compulsory.

In the mid 1980s, there were 9,530 primary and secondary schools. After graduating from people's school, students enter either a regular secondary school or a special secondary school that concentrates on music, art, or foreign languages. These schools teach both their specialties and general subjects. The Mangyongdae  Revolutionary Institute where the children of the North Korean elite are prepared for service as officers in the [[Korean People’s Army]] is an important special school where modern training in economics and computers is stressed as is the Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School.&lt;ref name=Yonhap101512&gt;{{cite news|title=Kim Jong-un stresses economic education for students of prestigious schools |url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2012/10/15/0401000000AEN20121015006100315.HTML |accessdate=October 15, 2012 |date=October 15, 2012 |agency=Yonhap |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110101209/http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2012/10/15/0401000000AEN20121015006100315.HTML |archivedate=January 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KBS101312&gt;{{cite news|title=Kim Jong-un Stresses Computer and Military Education |url=http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/news/news_IK_detail.htm?No=93843&amp;id=IKnews_IK_detail.htm |accessdate=October 15, 2012 |newspaper=KBS World |date=October 13, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709233522/http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/news/news_IK_detail.htm?No=93843&amp;id=IKnews_IK_detail.htm |archivedate=July 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In senior middle schools, politically oriented subjects, including the "Great Kim Il Sung" and "Communist Morality" as well as "Communist Party Policy," comprise only 5.8 percent of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00100&amp;num=2653 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112063717/http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00100&amp;num=2653 |archivedate=2012-01-12 }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social education==
[[File:North Korea-Pyongyang-Computer class at a school-01.jpg|thumb|300px|A computer class at a school.]]
Outside the formal structure of schools and classrooms is "social education." This education includes extracurricular activities, family life, and the range of human relationships in North Korean society. Attention is paid to the influence of the [[social environment]] on the growing child and its role in the development of his or her character.

The idea of social education is to provide a carefully controlled environment in which children are insulated from unplanned influences. According to a North Korean official interviewed in 1990, "School education is not enough to turn the rising generation into men of knowledge, virtue, and physical fitness. After school, our children have many spare hours. So it's important to efficiently organize their afterschool education."{{Citation needed|reason=Quote(s) origin?|date=March 2014}}

In his 1977 ''Theses on Socialist Education'', Kim Il Sung described the components of social education. In the [[Young Pioneer Corps]] and the [[Kim Il-sung Socialist Youth League|Socialist Youth League]], young people learn the nature of collective and organizational life in North Korea. Some prepare for membership in the Korean Workers' Party. In students' and schoolchildren's halls and palaces, managed by the SWYL [[Central Committee]], young people participate in many extracurricular activities after school.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/322222/North-Korea/34939/Education |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113035002/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/322222/North-Korea/34939/Education |archivedate=2011-01-13 }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There are cultural facilities such as libraries and museums, monuments and historical sites of the Korean revolution, and mass media dedicated to serving the goals of social education. Huge, lavishly appointed "schoolchildren's palaces" with gymnasiums and theaters have been built in P'yongyang, [[Mangyongdae Children's Palace|Mangyongdae]], and other sites. The palaces provide political lectures and seminars, debating contests, poetry recitals, and scientific forums. The Students' and Children's Palace in P'yongyang attracted some 10,000 children daily in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

North Korea compares their system of education to the ideal standards espoused by international guidelines such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).

==Higher education==
Institutions of higher education include colleges and universities; teachers' training colleges, with a four-year course for preparing kindergarten, primary, and secondary instructors; colleges of advanced technology with two or three-year courses; medical schools with six-year courses; special colleges for science and engineering, art, music, and foreign languages; and military colleges and academies. Kim Il Sung's report to the Sixth [[Party conference|Party Congress]] of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] in October 1980 revealed that there were 170 "higher learning institutions" and 480 "higher specialized schools" that year.

In 1987 there were 220,000 students attending two- or three-year higher specialized schools and 301,000 students attending four- to six-year colleges and university courses. According to Eberstadt and Banister, 13.7 percent of the population sixteen years of age or older was attending, or had graduated from, institutions of higher education in 1987-88. In 1988 the regime surpassed its target of producing "an army of 1.3 million intellectuals," graduates of higher education, a major step in the direction of achieving the often-stated goal of "intellectualization of the whole society." {{Citation needed|reason=Quote(s) origin?|date=March 2014}}

=== Universities ===
{{Further|List of universities in North Korea}}

Every university in North Korea has to receive certain percentage (twenty to thirty) of discharged soldiers (served longer than three years) or workers (employed longer than five years).&lt;ref&gt;NK Watch&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kim Il Sung University]], founded in October 1946, is the country's only comprehensive institution of higher education offering bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees. Its enrollment of 16,000 full- and part-time students in the early 1990s occupies, in the words of one observer, the "pinnacle of the North Korean educational and social system." Competition for admission is intense.

According to a [[Korean American|Korean–American]] scholar who visited the university in the early 1980s, only one student is admitted out of every five or six applicants. An important criterion for admission is senior middle school grades, although political criteria are also major factors in selection. A person wishing to gain acceptance to any institution of higher education has to be nominated by the local "college recommendation committee" before approval by county- and provincial-level committees.

[[Kim Il-Sung University]]'s [[college]]s and [[Faculty (division)|faculties]] include [[economics]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[foreign language]]s and [[literature]], [[geography]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[chemistry]], [[nuclear power]], [[biology]], and [[computer science]]. There are about 3,000 faculty members, including teaching and research staff. All facilities are located on a modern, high-rise campus in the northern part of P'yongyang.

Other notable universities include [[Kim Chaek University of Technology]] and the [[University of Natural Science]], which focuses on computer science and natural science related to mass nuclear research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nti.org/facilities/757/ Kim Chaek University of Technology | Facilities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424014616/http://www.nti.org/facilities/757/ |date=2014-04-24 }}.

[[Choson Exchange]], a non-profit organization founded by [[Harvard]], [[Yale]], [[Wharton School]] and [[Singaporeans|Singaporean]] graduate students, also runs consulting and training programs in [[Finance]], [[Business]] and [[Economics]] with [[Kim Il Sung University]] and the State Development Bank in North Korea.&lt;ref name="Choson Exchange"&gt;{{cite news

[[Pyongyang University of Science and Technology]] (PUST), which opened in 2010, is the country's only joint venture institute of higher learning, founded, funded and operated by Evangelical Church groups and people from both North and South Korea, as well as [[China]] and the [[United States|USA]]. It plans to recruit around 200 [[Master's degree|Master]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] level students annually, from both Koreas, and with half of faculty hired from universities and research institutes abroad. At this university, courses will be taught in Korean and English. In addition, the Pyongyang Business School offers short courses given by foreign lecturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2010/02/the_long_road_to_higher_educat_1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922074334/http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2010/02/the_long_road_to_higher_educat_1.html |archivedate=2010-09-22 }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by the Swiss government and helps teach students business management.&lt;ref name="ft-business"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/1/99955058-1014-11da-bd5c-00000e2511c8.html#axzz4HUEsNUrl|title=Graduates prove N Korea is now open for business|last=Fifield|first=Anna|date=18 August 2005|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another economic educational institution is the Centre for the Study of the Capitalist System, established in 2000.&lt;ref name="koreatimes-trade"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/04/120_14039.html |title=NK Showing Increased Interest in Foreign Trade |date=20 November 2007 |publisher=The Korea Times |accessdate=17 October 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212122155/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/04/120_14039.html |archivedate=12 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adult education==

Because of the emphasis on the continued education of all members of society, adult or work-study education is actively supported. Practically everyone in the country participates in some educational activity, usually in the form of "small study groups."

In the early 1990s, people in rural areas were organized into "five-family teams." These teams have educational and surveillance functions; the teams are the responsibility of a schoolteacher or other intellectual, each one being in charge of several such teams. Office and factory workers have two-hour "study sessions" after work each day on both political and technical subjects.

Adult education institutions in the early 1990s included "factory colleges", which teach workers new skills and techniques without forcing them to quit their jobs. Students work part-time, study in the evening, or take short intensive courses, leaving their workplaces for only a month or so. There are also "farm colleges", where rural workers can study to become engineers and assistant engineers, and a system of [[Distance education|correspondence courses]]. For workers and peasants who are unable to receive regular school education, there are "laborers' schools" and "laborers' senior middle schools," although in the early 1990s these had become less important with the introduction of compulsory eleven-year education. {{Citation needed|reason=Quote(s) origin?|date=March 2014}}

[[Personalized medicine]] involves [[Medicine|medical treatments]] based on the characteristics of individual patients, including their [[medical history]], [[family history]], and [[genetics]]. Although personal genetic information is becoming increasingly important in healthcare, there is a lack of sufficient education in [[medical genetics]] among physicians and the general public.&lt;ref name="Lamb2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lamb | first1 = N.

In the United States, [[Stanford University]] was the first medical school in the United States to offer a course teaching the interpretation of genetic data.&lt;ref name="Roethel2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=Stanford genotype class asks: What's your type? |author=Kathryn Roethel |url=http://www.sfgate.com/education/article/Stanford-genotype-class-asks-What-s-your-type-3258926.php |newspaper=SFGate |date=July 12, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students were able to study their own [[genotype]]s, determined using commercially available [[Personal genomics|genotyping platforms]] ([[23andMe]] or [[Navigenics]]).&lt;ref name="Jabr2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=Exposing the Student Body: Stanford Joins U.C.

==Personal genotyping and education==
In 2010, the [[University of California, Berkeley]] offered entering students a genetic test for [[single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]] affecting alcohol, lactose, and folate metabolism.&lt;ref name="Nature2010"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A DNA education |author= |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v465/n7300/full/465845b.html |newspaper=Nature |date=June 16, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013 |volume=465 |issue=7300 |doi=10.1038/465845b |pages=845–846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=College bound, DNA swab in hand |author=Tamar Lewin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/education/19dna.html|newspaper=Nature |date=May 18, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was “to spark discussion during orientation on how genetic testing works, the results of the students' tests and their decisions on whether or not to participate.”&lt;ref name="Jabr2010"/&gt; However, criticism of the program led to an informational hearing by the California State Committee on Higher Education, and a bill was introduced by [[Chris Norby]] to prevent California state universities from genetically testing their students.&lt;ref name="Gross2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=UC Berkeley DNA testing goes before state committee |author=Rachel Gross |url=http://www.berkeleyside.com/2010/08/11/dna-testing-at-u-c-berkeley-goes-before-state-committee/ |newspaper=Berkeleyside |date=August 11, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Genome2010b"&gt;{{cite news |title=California Legislation Seeks to Bar UC Berkeley's Genetic Testing Plans |author= |url=http://www.genomeweb.com/dxpgx/california-legislation-seeks-bar-uc-berkeleys-genetic-testing-plans |newspaper=Genome Web Daily News |date=July 14, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The California Department of Public Health concluded that the program constituted clinical testing, and the university released only aggregate information instead of personal results.&lt;ref name="NNB2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=State halts UC Berkeley’s gene testing plans |author=Alla Katsnelson |url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/2010/08/state_halts_uc_berkeleys_gene_1.html |newspaper=Nature News Blog |date=August 12, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaw2012"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Right Type: Personal Genetic Testing in the Medical School Curriculum |author=Gina Shaw |url=https://www.aamc.org/newsroom/reporter/feb2012/273822/genetic-testing.html |newspaper=AAMC Reporter |date=February 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in the preceding section, in some courses on personalized medicine, students have been able to study their personal genetic information. For the Stanford course, which was designed for graduate and medical students, a review was conducted in 2009-2010 by a “joint genotyping task force” including research and clinical faculty, biomedical ethicists, genetic counselors, and legal counsel.&lt;ref name="Salari2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature2010"/&gt; The recommendations adopted included: making genetic testing optional (with instructors blinded to the choice of the students), strict data confidentiality (only aggregate data was made available during discussions), incorporation of lectures discussing issues related to personal genotyping, and availability of genetic counseling to students if necessary.&lt;ref name="Salari2011"/&gt;

'''Erowid''', also called '''Erowid Center''', is a [[501(c) organization#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] non-profit educational organization that provides information about [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive plants and chemicals]] as well as activities and technologies that can produce [[Altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]] such as [[meditation]], [[lucid dream]]ing, [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]], and [[electroceuticals]].

Erowid documents legal and illegal substances, including their intended and adverse effects. Information on Erowid's website is gathered from diverse sources including published literature, experts in related fields, and the experiences of the general public. Erowid acts as a [[publisher]] of new information as well as a library for the collection of documents and images published elsewhere.

== History ==
Erowid was founded in April 1995 as a small business; their website appeared six months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Erowid |first=Fire |url=http://www.erowid.org/general/about/about_article5.shtml |title=Erowid F. "Erowid: 10 Years of History." Erowid Extracts. Jun 2005;8:12-14 |publisher=Erowid.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Erowid" was chosen to reflect the organization's stated philosophy of education. Using Proto-Indo-European linguistic roots, "Erowid" roughly translates into "Earth Wisdom" (''er'' meaning 'earth,' 'exist,' and 'be born' and ''wid'' meaning 'knowledge' / 'wisdom' or 'to see').&lt;ref name=trip&gt;Emily Witt. [https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/the-trip-planners "The trip planners."] ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]].'' 23 November 2015. Retrieved 2018-03-05.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit educational organization "Erowid Center" was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/20-3256212/erowid-center.aspx |title=Guidestar Entry |publisher=Guidestar |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is supported by donations, and its [[website]] is free of advertisements. Although its primary focus is on the website, Erowid Center also provides research and data for other [[harm reduction]], health, and [[education]]al organizations. The organization is based in [[Northern California]] and the main servers are located in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.erowid.org/general/about/about_faq.shtml#located|title=Where is Erowid located?|accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both work full-time on the project, along with speaking at conferences, producing original research, and contributing to [[entheogen]]ic research. According to the site, the creators' vision includes a "world where people treat psychoactives with respect and awareness; where people work together to collect and share knowledge in ways that strengthen their understanding of themselves and provide insight into the complex choices faced by individuals and societies alike". Erowid Center's mission is to provide and facilitate access to objective, accurate, and non-judgmental information about psychoactive plants, chemicals, technologies, and related issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9M2qN8Oi4AcC&amp;dq=real+drugs+virtual+world&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Murguia E, Tackett-Gibson M, Lessem A.

== Online library ==
The library contains over 63,000 documents related to over 350 psychoactive substances,&lt;ref name=trip/&gt; including images, research summaries and abstracts, [[FAQ]]s, [[Mass media|media]] articles, experience reports, information on [[chemistry]], dosage, effects, [[law]], [[health]], traditional and [[entheogen|spiritual use]], and [[drug testing]]. {{ as of |2014 | 07 }}, over 17 million people visit the site each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.erowid.org/general/newsletter/erowid_newsletter26.shtml |title=''Erowid Extracts'': July 2014, Number 26 |publisher=Erowid Center |date= |accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site generally contains more detail in the pages listed under [[plants]] and [[chemicals]] than in other sections. It does not have comprehensive information about the specific effects of most pharmaceuticals. Such information may appear elsewhere on the site, where one can read about people's individual reactions to various drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Erowid Experience Vaults: Complete Substance and Category List|url = https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp_list.shtml|website = www.erowid.org|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==

=== Experience Vaults ===
Erowid allows site visitors to submit descriptions of their own personal experiences with psychoactive substances for review and possible publication. The site states that they welcome all perspectives regarding personal psychoactive experience, including positive, negative and neutral. Their collection consists of more than 30,000 edited, reviewed, and published reports, as well as stating that they have another 55,000 unpublished reports undergoing review.&lt;ref&gt;https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.cgi?S1=0&amp;S2=-1&amp;C1=-1&amp;Str=&lt;/ref&gt;

=== EcstasyData ===
Erowid also runs EcstasyData.org, an independent laboratory [[pill testing]] program co-sponsored by IsomerDesign and [[DanceSafe]], which monitors the quality of American street-[[MDMA|ecstasy]].

Launched in July 2001, its purpose is to collect, manage, review, and present laboratory pill testing results from a variety of organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ecstasydata.org/about.php |title=About EcstasyData.org |publisher=EcstasyData |date= |accessdate=2010-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tablets of street ecstasy can be anonymously submitted to a DEA licensed laboratory for testing and then photos of the tablets and GC/MS test results are published on the project's website. EcstasyData has published testing results for nearly 3,000 samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ecstasydata.org/datastats.php?row=Summary&amp;col=year&amp;percent=0 |title=Test Result Statistics: Summary Data |publisher=EcstasyData.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testing costs have sometimes been covered by project funding (when available) and at other times are covered by those who submit tablets for testing. At least one published study uses EcstasyData.org as primary source of data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=6995 Tanner-Smith EE. "Pharmacological content of tablets sold as 'ecstasy': results from an online testing service".] Drug Alcohol Depend. 2006;83(3):247–54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=7152 Tanner-Smith EE. "Corrigendum to 'Pharmacological content of tablets sold as 'ecstasy': Results from an online testing service'".] Drug Alcohol Depend. 2008;93(1-2):190.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Erowid Extracts ===
''Erowid Extracts'', the bi-annual members newsletter of Erowid, has been published each year since 2001. It provides updates on the organization's activities, results of surveys conducted on Erowid.org, experience reports, new articles on various aspects of psychedelic and psychoactive plants and drugs, and information about psychedelic culture and events. New issues of ''Erowid Extracts'' are sent to members, but past issues are available on the Erowid website.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.erowid.org/general/about/about_newsletter.shtml |title=''Erowid Extracts'' |publisher=Erowid Center |date= |accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychoactive Reference Library ==
Erowid and [[Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies|The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies]] (MAPS) collaborated on two large reference database projects. Erowid has provided expertise and work developing and coordinating construction of an online Psychoactive drug reference library and MAPS has published a similar collection &lt;ref&gt;http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v11n1/11119ero.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Document Archiving ==
Erowid Center also archives and provides access to thousands of older texts in their online and physical libraries. By collecting and making these texts available, they attempt to  promote an understanding of the changing contexts surrounding the use of psychoactive drugs. Major archiving projects include the Albert Hofmann collection, the Myron Stolaroff Collection, and documents from Alexander Shulgin.

== Controversy ==
Due to the subject matter presented on Erowid.org, the site has drawn praise and criticism from both the media and medical officials. American physician and broadcaster [[Dean Edell]] often recommends Erowid to listeners interested in learning about drugs and drug use.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} On the other hand, Edward Boyer, an emergency-room physician and toxicologist, while admitting that Erowid has a plethora of useful information, once argued the site may cause more harm than good to potential drug users. {{who|date=September 2014}} "Though Boyer has since come to cautiously admire Earth and Fire, and no longer refers to their site as 'partisan,' he still argues that Erowid minimizes adverse effects and includes too much dodgy&amp;nbsp;– and potentially harmful&amp;nbsp;– data in its quest to present all sides. 'Erowid is so comprehensive, and so much of the information is correct, that unless you're an expert in medical toxicology you may miss the dangerous information that's close to the surface.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.laweekly.com/ink/04/23/features-davis.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324095519/http://www.laweekly.com/ink/04/23/features-davis.php |author=Davis E. |title=Don't Get High Without It |publisher=LA Weekly |archivedate=2005-03-24 |date=2004-04-30 |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of this debate, anthropologist Nicolas Langlitz argued that Erowid also sometimes serves as a mechanism of postmarket surveillance or [[pharmacovigilance]] in the realm of illicit and experimental substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Nicolas Langlitz |url=http://sss.sagepub.com/content/39/3/395.abstract |title=Pharmacovigilance and Post-black Market Surveillance |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=395–420 |publisher=Sss.sagepub.com |date=2009-06-01 |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia has blocked access to Erowid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefix.com/content/russia-blacklists-drug-wikipedia-erowid91343 Russia Bans the Wikipedia of Drugs] The Fix 2013-02-28&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eugenia Popescu-Județ''' (also spelled Popescu-Judetz, 1925&amp;ndash;2011) was a [[Romania]]n dancer, dance teacher, choreographer and folklorist. Trained in ballet, she performed as a solo dancer for several professional theatres in Bucharest and became a famed choreographer of folk-inspired character dance working for film, TV, and several professional ensembles in Romania. She taught folk dance in Romania and internationally. Later she became an expert in manuscripts relating to the 17th century Romanian prince and composer [[Dimitrie Cantemir]].

==Life and work==

Eugenia Popescu-Județ, née Marisescu, was born in [[Giurgiu]], Romania in 1925. Trained since childhood in classical ballet, she became a professional dancer and solo ballerina with the National Theatre Ballet of Bucharest (1945–50) and the National Opera, also in Bucharest (1950–54). After her marriage to the dancer [[Gheorghe Popescu-Județ]] her interest in Romanian folk dance increased. Together they performed folk dance-inspired choreographies and they won the first prize for character dance in the International Dance Competition at Prague.&lt;ref name="his vita"&gt;Popescu-Județ, Gheorghe, Eugenia Popescu-Județ, and James Roncevic. 1979. Judetz folk dance notation. Pittsburgh, Pa. Duquesne University Tamburitzans.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1954-70 she was ballet master and choreographer for the [[Perinița]] ensemble in Bucharest. In this time, she also worked as a guest choreographer for several other Romanian ensembles.&lt;ref name="Online Finding Aid"&gt;Forner, Michelle. Online Finding Aid.

The Gheorghe and Eugenia Popescu-Judetz Collection, Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;
Eugenia Popescu-Județ taught dance in various capacities, for example from 1948-50 as a folk dance teacher and choreographer at the School and Ensemble of Pioneers in Bucharest,&lt;ref name="Curriculum vitae"/&gt; at the High School of the Arts in Bucharest, and later in the United States.

Eugenia also had a career as a researcher and scholar. From 1949-51, she worked as a researcher at the Folklore Institute in Bucharest (then Institut de Folclor, today Institut de Etnografie si Folclor 'Constantin Brăiloiu').&lt;ref name="Curriculum vitae"/&gt; From 1949 into the 1960s, she frequently accompanied her husband on research trips in the field to study Romanian folk dance &lt;ref name="Online Finding Aid"/&gt;
At a time when international travels were a rare privilege for Romanians, Eugenia Popescu-Județ frequently travelled as a guest lecturer and dance instructor: to India (1969), Yugoslavia (1969), Lebanon (1969), the United States (1970), Belgium (1970–71), and Finland (1971).

After her husband died in 1972, Eugenia permanently moved to the United States in 1973. In the US she taught at the University of Duquesne in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Subsequently, she became an adjunct professor at Duquesne and continued to teach and choreograph for their dance ensemble The Tamburitzans (collection guide). In the US, she received several advanced university degrees, including a Ph.D. from University of Pittsburgh, and published several books and articles, some of which are concerned with [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] and Turkish music.

Between 1990 and 1995, Eugenia donated Gheorghe's and her own collection to the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, Washington, DC.&lt;ref name="Online Finding Aid"/&gt; Eugenia Popescu-Județ died on December 20, 2011 in Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;ref name="Romanian obituary"&gt;Jela, Doina.

The '''European Democratic Education Conference''' ('''EUDEC''') is an annual [[Convention (meeting)|conference]] of the [[European Democratic Education Community]], a [[Europe]]an network of people involved in [[democratic education]]. The first conference was held in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]], from 25 July – 3 August 2008. The organisation of the 2008 conference was largely independent of the EUDEC Community, as the latter was founded in February 2008 after over a year of conference groundwork. Following the first conference, the dates, locations and content of conferences are determined by the Community.

Both Conference and Community arose from the need of democratic education proponents in Europe for deeper networking and coordination. The conference's location in Europe makes it comparatively easy for people in Europe to participate, because the annual [[International Democratic Education Conference]] (IDEC) is held in different locations all over the world and travel costs from Europe are often 
prohibitive.

The 2009 EUDEC Annual General Meeting was in Cieszyn, Poland.

The 2010 EUDEC Annual General Meeting was in Roskilde, Denmark.

The 2011 IDEC@EUDEC Conference, in the [[UK]] was both an IDEC and an EUDEC Conference which ran from 5 to 14 July.

The 2012 EUDEC Annual General Meeting and Conference was held in Freiburg, Germany which ran from 28 July to 5 August. 

The 2013 EUDEC Annual General Meeting and Conference was held in [[Soest, Netherlands|Soest]], [[Netherlands]] between 28 July till 2 August.

The 2014 EUDEC Annual General Meeting and Conference was held in Copenhagen, Denmark between 5 and 8 August. 

The 2015 EUDEC Annual General Meeting and Conference was held in Ojrzanów near [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] between 1 and 9 August.

The 2016 IDEC@EUDEC Conference will be held in [[Mikkeli]], Finland between 6 and  10 June.

'''Friedrich Weber''', Dr. (30 January 1892 &amp;ndash; 19 July 1954) was an instructor in veterinary medicine at the [[University of Munich]]. In World War I he served in the [[Royal Bavarian 1st Heavy Cavalry Regiment "Prince Karl of Bavaria"]]. He was the leader of the [[Freikorps Oberland|Oberland League]] and ranked alongside [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Erich Ludendorff]], [[Ernst Röhm]] and [[Hermann Kriebel]] as one of the chief conspirators of the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in November 1923. He was convicted along with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] in 1925 but continued to head the [[Freikorps Oberland|Oberland League]] until 1929.

After his release from prison, he set up a private vet practice in Munich and continued close contact with [[Hitler]] being given a lucrative position in Berlin after Hitler's accession to power in 1933. He became an army vet late in [[World War II]]. After the war, he was heavily fined for war profiteering, but continued to practise veterinary medicine, eventually dying in reduced circumstances in 1954.

'''Helen Elizabeth Haste''' (born March 17, 1943), also known as '''Helen Weinreich-Haste''', is a British [[social psychology|social]], [[developmental psychology|developmental]], and [[cultural psychology|cultural psychologist]] and a writer and broadcaster. She is a [[visiting professor]] in the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]].&lt;ref name="Harvard bio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gse.harvard.edu/directory/faculty/faculty-detail/?fc=182&amp;flt=h&amp;sub=all | title=Harvard bio | accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is an [[emeritus professor]] of [[psychology]] at the [[University of Bath]]. Haste also holds honorary visiting positions at the [[University of Exeter]], the [[Hong Kong Institute of Education]], and the [[University of Jinan]] China.

== Research ==
Haste's research focuses on young people's moral and political beliefs, and also on gender issues particularly in relation to science and culture. Her work on moral and political development and the civic engagement of young people has explored the factors that promote or inhibit participation in both conventional and unconventional forms of action. Haste is interested especially in how cultural narratives and metaphors are reflected in the development of young people's beliefs. Her work on science, society, and gender has explored the cultural images of science, how they reflect dominant models of rationality, how these are associated with conceptions of gender, and how they influence motivation to take up science interests. Alone or in collaboration with others she has worked on data from the UK, China, and South Africa. Haste is the author or editor of five books and over a hundred academic research paper and chapters. Books include ''The Sexual Metaphor'' ([[Harvard University Press]], 2004), ''Making Sense: the Child's Construction of the World'' (with Jerome Bruner: [[Routledge]] 1987), ''The Development of Political Understanding'' (with Judith Torney-Purta, [[Jossey-Bass]], 1992). She has also written numerous popular articles and has been a frequent broadcaster on British radio and television.

== Academic honours and service==
Haste is a Fellow of the [[British Psychological Society]],&lt;ref name="Fellow of British Psychological Society"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bps.org.uk/bpssearchablelists/fellows?frmAction=showUser&amp;Mem_MemberKeys_Selected=8309 |title=Fellow of British Psychological Socieity |accessdate=20 May 2014 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Fellow of the [[Academy of Social Science]] and a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]].

''Hikikomori'' have been described as [[Loner|loners]] or "modern-day [[hermit]]s".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite AV media |last=Teo |first=Alan |date=November 8, 2012 |title=Modern-Day Hermits: The Story Hikkomori in Japan and Beyond |medium=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70bv5gaN4LI |access-date=February 26, 2014 |publisher=[[University of Michigan]] Center for Japanese Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates suggest that nearly half a million Japanese youth have become social recluses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/11/asia/japanese-millennials-hikikomori-social-recluse/index.html |title=Why won't 541,000 young Japanese leave the house? |first=Emiko |last=Jozuka |date=September 12, 2016 |work=[[CNN News]] |access-date=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The Japanese [[Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare]] defines ''hikikomori'' as a condition in which the affected individuals isolate themselves from society in their homes for a period exceeding six months.{{sfn|Itou|2003}} The psychiatrist [[Tamaki Saitō]] defines ''hikikomori'' as "a state that has become a problem by the late twenties, that involves cooping oneself up in one's own home and not participating in society for six months or longer, but that does not seem to have another psychological problem as its principal source".{{sfn|Saitō|2012}}

More recently, researchers have developed more specific criteria to more accurately identify ''hikikomori''. During a diagnostic interview, trained clinicians evaluate for:{{sfnm |1a1=Teo |1a2=Gaw |1y=2010 |2a1=Teo |2a2=Stufflebam |2a3=Saha |2a4=Fetters |2y=2015 |2p=182}}
# spending most of the day and nearly every day confined to home, 
# marked and persistent avoidance of social situations, 
# social withdrawal symptoms causing significant functional impairment, 
# duration of at least six months, and 
# no apparent physical pathology to account for the social withdrawal symptoms.

The psychiatrist Alan Teo first characterized ''hikikomori'' in Japan as modern-day hermits,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; while the literary and communication scholar Flavio Rizzo similarly described ''hikikomori'' as "post-modern hermits" whose solitude stems from ancestral desires for withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rizzo |first=Flavio |date=14 June 2016 |title=Hikikomori: The Postmodern Hermits of Japan |url=http://www.warscapes.com/opinion/hikikomori-postmodern-hermits-japan |website=Warscapes |access-date=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the degree of the phenomenon varies on an individual basis, in the most extreme cases, some people remain in isolation for years or even decades. Often ''hikikomori'' start out as [[school refusal|school refuser]]s, or {{Nihongo|''futōkō''|不登校}} in Japanese (an older term is {{Nihongo|''tōkōkyohi''|登校拒否}}).

==Common traits==
While many people feel the pressures of the outside world, ''hikikomori'' react by complete social withdrawal. In some cases, they isolate themselves in their living quarters for prolonged periods, sometimes for years.{{sfn|Teo|2013}} They usually have few or no friends. In interviews with current or recovering ''hikikomori'', media reports and documentaries have captured the strong levels of psychological distress and angst felt by these individuals.&lt;ref name="FusionTV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fusion.net/video/568756/hikikomori-japans-lost-generation-of-digital-age-hermits/|title=Hikikomori: Japan's Lost Generation of Digital Age Hermits}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While ''hikikomori'' favour indoor activities, some venture outdoors occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vickery.dk/hikikomori] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208025913/http://vickery.dk/hikikomori|date=February 8, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The withdrawal from society usually starts gradually. Affected people may appear unhappy, lose their friends, become [[Emotional insecurity|insecure]] and [[Shyness|shy]], and talk less.

==Prevalence==
According to government figures released in 2010, there are 700,000 individuals living as ''hikikomori'' with an average age of 31.&lt;ref name=JT&gt;{{cite news |last=Hoffman |first=Michael |date=9 October 2011 |title=Nonprofits in Japan help 'shut-ins' get out into the open |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2011/10/09/national/media-national/nonprofits-in-japan-help-shut-ins-get-out-into-the-open/ |newspaper=The Japan Times Online |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the numbers vary widely among experts. These include the ''hikikomori'' who are now in their 40s and have spent 20 years in isolation.  This group is generally referred to as the "first-generation ''hikikomori''.”  There is concern about their reintegration into society in what is known as "the 2030 Problem,” when they are in their 60s and their parents begin to die.&lt;ref name=JT/&gt; Additionally, the government estimates that 1.55 million people are on the verge of becoming ''hikikomori''.&lt;ref name=JT/&gt; [[Tamaki Saitō]], who first coined the phrase, originally estimated that there may be over one million ''hikikomori'' in [[Japan]], although this was not based on national survey data. Nonetheless, considering that ''hikikomori'' adolescents are hidden away and their parents are often reluctant to talk about the problem, it is extremely difficult to gauge the number accurately.{{sfn|Saitō|1998}}

While ''hikikomori'' is mostly a Japanese phenomenon, cases have been found in the [[United States]], [[Morocco]], [[Oman]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[South Korea]], [[Finland]] and [[France]].{{sfn|Teo|2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gozlan |first=Marc |date=9 June 2012 |title=Des cas d'hikikomori en France |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2012/06/07/des-cas-d-hikikomori-en-france_1714707_1650684.html |newspaper=Le Monde |language=French |page=3 |access-date=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research using the same standardized definition of ''hikikomori'' has found evidence of it existing in other countries as wide-ranging as the United States and India.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Hypotheses on cause==

===Psychiatric disorders===
''Hikikomori'' is similar to the social withdrawal exhibited by some people with [[autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]], a group of disorders that include [[Asperger syndrome]], [[PDD not otherwise specified|PDD-NOS]] and "classic" [[autism]]. This has led some psychiatrists to suggest that ''hikikomori'' may be affected by autism spectrum disorders and other disorders that affect social integration, but that their disorders are altered from their typical Western presentation because of the social and cultural pressures unique to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kary |first=Tiffany |year=2003 |title=Total Eclipse of the Son: Why are Millions of Japanese Youths Hiding from Friends and Family? |url=http://psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-2550.html |work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suwa &amp; Hara (2007) discovered that 5 of 27 cases of ''hikikomori'' had a high-functioning [[pervasive developmental disorder]] (HPDD), and 12 more had other disorders or mental diseases (6 cases of personality disorders, 3 cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder, 2 cases of depression, 1 case of slight mental retardation). The researchers used a vignette to illustrate the difference between primary ''hikikomori'' (without any obvious mental disorder) and ''hikikomori'' with HPDD or other disorder; furthermore, 10 out of 27 had primary ''hikikomori''.{{sfn|Suwa|Hara|2007}} Alan Teo and colleagues conducted detailed diagnostic evaluations of 22 individuals with ''hikikomori'' and found that while the majority of cases fulfilled criteria for multiple psychiatric conditions, about 1 in 5 cases were primary ''hikikomori''.{{sfn|Teo|Stufflebam|Saha|Fetters|2015|p=182}}

According to [[Michael Zielenziger]]'s book, ''Shutting Out the Sun: How Japan Created Its Own Lost Generation'', the syndrome is more closely related to [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]. The author claimed that the ''hikikomori'' interviewed for the book had discovered independent thinking and a sense of self that the current Japanese environment could not accommodate.{{sfn|Zielenziger|2006}}

The syndrome also closely parallels the terms [[avoidant personality disorder]], [[schizoid personality disorder]], or [[social anxiety disorder]] (also known as "social phobia").

===Social and cultural influence===
Sometimes referred to as a social problem in Japanese discourse, ''hikikomori'' has a number of possible contributing factors. Alan Teo has summarized a number of potential cultural features that may contribute to its predominance in Japan.  These include tendencies toward conformity and collectivism, overprotective parenting, and particularities of the educational and economic systems.{{sfn|Teo|Stufflebam|Kato|2014}}

Acute social withdrawal in Japan appears to affect both genders equally.  However, because of differing social expectations for maturing boys and girls, the most widely reported cases of ''hikikomori'' are from middle- and upper-middle-class families; sons, typically their eldest, refuse to leave the home, often after experiencing one or more traumatic episodes of social or academic failure.

In ''[[The Anatomy of Dependence]]'', [[Takeo Doi]] identifies the symptoms of ''hikikomori'', and explains its prevalence as originating in the Japanese psychological construct of ''[[amae]]'' (in [[Freud]]ian terms, "passive object love", typically of the kind between mother and infant).{{sfn|Doi|1973}} Other Japanese commentators such as academic [[Shinji Miyadai]] and novelist [[Ryū Murakami]], have also offered analysis of the ''hikikomori'' phenomenon, and find distinct causal relationships with the modern Japanese social conditions of [[anomie]], ''amae'' and atrophying paternal influence in nuclear family child [[pedagogy]]. Young adults may feel overwhelmed by modern Japanese society, or be unable to fulfill their expected social roles as they have not yet formulated a sense of personal [[honne and tatemae|''honne'' and ''tatemae'']] – one's "true self" and one's "public façade" – necessary to cope with the paradoxes of adulthood.

The dominant nexus of ''hikikomori'' centres on the transformation from youth to the responsibilities and expectations of adult life. Indications are that advanced industrialized societies such as modern Japan fail to provide sufficient meaningful transformation rituals for promoting certain susceptible types of youth into mature roles. As do many societies, Japan exerts a great deal of pressure on adolescents to be successful and perpetuate the existing social [[status quo]]. A traditionally strong emphasis on [[Japanese etiquette|complex social conduct]], rigid hierarchies and the resulting, potentially intimidating multitude of social expectations, responsibilities and duties in Japanese society contribute to this pressure on young adults.{{sfn|Rohlen|1989}} Historically, [[Confucianism|Confucian]] teachings de-emphasizing the individual and favouring a [[Conformity|conformist]] stance to ensure social harmony in a rigidly hierarchized society have shaped much of [[East Asia]], possibly explaining the emergence of the ''hikikomori'' phenomenon in other East Asian countries.

In general, the prevalence of ''hikikomori'' tendencies in Japan may be encouraged and facilitated by three primary factors:
#Middle class affluence in a [[post-industrial society]] such as Japan allows parents to support and feed an adult child in the home indefinitely. Lower-income families do not have ''hikikomori'' children because a socially withdrawing youth is forced to work outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;Kudō, Sadatsugu and Saitō, Tamaki. September 2001. Argument! Hikikomori. Tokyo: Studio Pot. Shuppan.　工藤　定次(著),斎藤　環(著),「永冨奈津恵」。「激論!ひきこもり」東京：ポット出版、９月、２００１。{{ISBN|4939015378}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The inability of Japanese parents to recognize and act upon the youth's slide into isolation; soft parenting; or codependence between mother and son, known as [[amae]] in Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Kudō, Sadatsugu.

#A [[Lost Decade (Japan)|decade of flat economic indicators]] and a shaky job market in Japan makes the pre-existing system requiring years of competitive schooling for elite jobs appear like a pointless effort to many.{{sfn|Okano|Tsuchiya|1999}}

====Japanese education system====
{{See also|Kyōiku mama}}
The [[Education in Japan|Japanese education system]], like those found in [[Education in the People's Republic of China|China]], [[Education in Singapore|Singapore]] and [[Education in South Korea|South Korea]], puts great demands upon youth. A multitude of expectations, high emphasis on competition, and the rote memorization of facts and figures for the purpose of passing entrance exams into the next tier of education in what could be termed a rigid ''pass-or-fail'' ideology, induce a high level of stress. Echoing the traditional [[Confucianism|Confucian]] values of society, the educational system is viewed as playing an important part in society's overall [[productivity]] and success.{{sfn|Rohlen|1992}}

In this social frame, students often face significant pressure from parents and the society in general to conform to its dictates and doctrines.{{sfn|Rohlen|1996}} These doctrines, while part of modern Japanese society, are increasingly being rejected by Japanese youth in varying ways such as ''hikikomori'', [[freeter]], [[NEET]] (Not currently engaged in Employment, Education, or Training), and [[parasite singles]]. The term "Hodo-Hodo [[zoku]]" (the "So-So tribe") applies to younger workers who refuse promotion to minimize stress and maximize free time.

Beginning in the 1960s, the pressure on Japanese youth to succeed began successively earlier in their lives, sometimes starting before [[Nursery school|pre-school]], where even [[toddler]]s had to compete through an entrance exam for the privilege of attending one of the best pre-schools. This was said to prepare children for the entrance exam of the best [[kindergarten]], which in turn prepared the child for the entrance exam of the best [[elementary school]], [[junior high school]], [[high school]], and eventually for their [[List of universities in Japan|university]] entrance exam.{{sfn|M. White|1987}} Many adolescents take one year off after high school to study exclusively for the university entrance [[exam]], and are known as ''[[Rōnin (student)|ronin]]''.{{sfn|Tsukada|1991}} More prestigious universities have more difficult exams. The most prestigious university with the most difficult exam is the [[University of Tokyo]].&lt;ref name=nyt20060105/&gt;

Since 1996, the [[Japanese Ministry of Education]] has taken steps to address this 'pressure-cooker' educational environment and instill greater creative thought in Japanese youth by significantly relaxing the school schedule from six-day weeks to five-day weeks and dropping two subjects from the daily schedule, with new academic curricula more comparable to Western educational models.  However, Japanese parents are sending their children to private [[cram school]]s, known as ''[[juku]]'', to 'make up' for lost time.&lt;ref name=bbc-missing-million/&gt;

After graduating from high school or university, Japanese youth also have to face a very difficult job market in Japan, often finding only part-time employment and ending up as freeters with little income, unable to start a family.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshimoto, K, and Japan Institute of Labor. 1996. "High School and Initial Career of Graduates." JIL Report No. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source of pressure is from their co-students, who may [[harassment|harass]] and [[bullying|bully]] (''ijime'') some students for a variety of reasons, including physical appearance, wealth, or educational or athletic performance. Some have been punished for bullying or [[truancy]], bringing shame to their families. Refusal to participate in society makes ''hikikomori'' an extreme subset of a much larger group of younger Japanese that includes [[Parasite single|parasite singles]] and [[Freeter|freeters]].&lt;ref name=nyt20060105&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Jones |first=Maggie |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/15/magazine/15japanese.html |title=Shutting Themselves In |date=15 January 2006 |magazine=The New York Times Magazine |accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-missing-million&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent/2334893.stm |title=BBC NEWS - Programmes - Correspondent - Japan: The Missing Million |publisher= |accessdate=11 March 2016|date=2002-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese financial crisis===
Some organizations such as the non-profit Japanese organization ''NPO lila'' have been trying to combat the financial burden the ''hikikomori'' phenomenon has had on Japan's economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npo-lila.com/ |title=NPO法人 楽の会リーラ |publisher=Npo-lila.com |accessdate=18 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622221856/http://npo-lila.com/ |archivedate=22 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese CD and DVD producer Avex Group produces DVD videos of live-action women staring into a camera to help ''hikikomori'' learn to cope with eye contact and long spans of human interaction. The goal is to help ''hikikomori'' reintegrate into society by personal choice, thereby realizing an economic contribution and reducing the financial burden on parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kumalanguage.com/hikikomori-japans-social-ghosts/|title=Hikikomori - Japan's Social Ghosts - Kuma Language Services|date=18 July 2016|language=en-US|access-date=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Carey DeVuono's Hollywood Mogul''''' is a [[computer game]] released in 1993 that allows players act as entrepreneurs to take charge of a movie studio. It was conceived, designed and published solely by Carey DeVuono. An economic simulation game, players can choose movie plots to use for a movie, set production budgets and select the talent as well. The game's goal is to create movies that sell well. Players must juggle the added concerns of movie budgets, cost over-runs, and irritable actors and directors in order to succeed.

The original DOS version was written in [[Visual Basic]].{{r|wilson199404}} A [[Microsoft Windows]] version was released in 1997. A sequel, ''Hollywood Mogul 3'', was released in late 2006. A pre-release was given to message board members and long-term fans on September 26, 2006. 
 
==Game mechanics==
''Hollywood Mogul'' has five difficulty levels to choose from, each with higher annual budgets. A higher annual budget causes higher monthly expenses, making it more difficult to keep the studio profitable, which provides a greater challenge to the player.

* New In Town ($125,000,000 Annual Budget)
*Still Green ($250,000,000 Annual Budget)
* On My Way   ($500,000,000 Annual Budget)
* Hollywood Player ($750,000,000 Annual Budget)
* Hollywood Mogul ($1,000,000,000 Annual Budget)

Movies come in fifteen set genres, ranging from [[comedy]] to [[drama]] to [[science fiction]], as well as six subgenres such as "farce" or "slapstick". Movies can rise and fall depending on what genre they are and what time of year they are released.

Acting, screenwriting and directing talent also play a great role in the success of a film. More popular talent costs more to hire, but have the benefit of raising the noticeability of a film. Likewise, production budget, [[special effects]] budgets and advertising play a big role as well.

==Recognition==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s reviewer in April 1994 said that despite ''Hollywood Mogul''{{'}}s "crude visual look ... I have found myself spending dozens of hours as a Hollywood bigwig rather than playing dozens of more expensive and graphically sexy games". Despite the lack of [[limited release|limited]] or [[Oscar bait|award season]]-oriented releases, he concluded that it "is a fascinating exercise for the detail-oriented gamer" preferring statistics over action or visuals.&lt;ref name="wilson199404"&gt;{{Cite magazine

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5374">'''ILAUD''' (or '''I.L.A. &amp; U.D.''' International Laboratory of Architecture and Urban Design) is the [[acronym]] for International Laboratory of Architecture and Urban Design. Founded by [[Giancarlo De Carlo]] in 1976 on the same concepts that led to the founding of [[Team X]]. The laboratory in 27 years of existence has accepted some of the most prestigious international architects, often personal friends and colleagues of the director [[Giancarlo De Carlo]] (among others [[Alison and Peter Smithson]], [[Sverre Fehn]], and [[Renzo Piano]]). Bringing students from around the world to think and design in Italy. The ILAUD took place in a systematic way each year during the summertime in some of the most picturesque Italian city such as [[Venice]], [[Siena]] and [[Urbino]]. While in the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] city, the ILAUD participants studied the recovery of the [[Hospital of Santa Maria della Scala|Santa Maria della Scala]] in [[Siena]].
In Venice many projects were made concerning the city itself and its surrounding. None of them were actually realised nor considered by the city Administration, although there were public exhibitions held.

Has produced numerous publications as a result of proposals made by the host city.

'''John Fitzallen Moore''' (February 23, 1928 – January 31, 2018) was an American [[physicist]], the son of authors [[Virginia Moore]] and [[Louis Untermeyer]].  His last name was legally changed after his parents' divorce.  His work in military electronics, communications, and [[spectroscopy]] culminated in medical electronics and x-ray products with the founding of the company Bio-Imaging Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Fitzallen Moore|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/dailyherald/obituary.aspx?pid=188122527|publisher=Chicago Suburban Daily|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
After attending schools in [[Scottsville, Virginia]] and [[High Mowing School]] in [[Wilton, New Hampshire]], Moore received a B.S. in [[nuclear physics]] from [[MIT]] in three years (where he and Walter Marvin Jr. founded the [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] in 1946), and won a [[National Science Foundation]] fellowship that led to an M.S. in solid-state physics from [[Harvard]]'s School of Applied Science.  His first full-time employment was at [[Raytheon]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], where he worked on [[radar]] and [[telemetry]].  At Hycon Eastern ([[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]; later acquired by [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]]), he moved from classified missile technology to become Systems Manager of a communications design office in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]].  On his return, he again worked in aircraft and missile telemetry as Director of Research and Engineering at ASCOP ([[Princeton, New Jersey]]; later a division of EMR/[[Schlumberger]]).  In 1960, he joined [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed Electronics]] in [[Plainfield, New Jersey]], where he advanced from Manager of Operations Analysis to Scientific Advisor to the President, while contributing to "[[EME (communications)|moon-bounce]]" communication systems and optical signal processors, and creating an infrared laboratory and corporate acquisition analysis.  While there, he was appointed to the Lockheed Corporate Research Council, and also attended [[Columbia University]] in New York half-time.  For the latter, his Ph.D. thesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openlibrary.org/b/OL5329470M/Infrared_absorption_of_carbon_dioxide_at_high_densities_with_application_to_the_atmosphere_of_Venus|title=Infrared absorption of carbon dioxide at high densities with application to the atmosphere of Venus.|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved experimentally that [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere of [[Venus]] has enough [[greenhouse effect]] to warm its surface to the spacecraft-observed temperature of over 460&amp;nbsp;°C (860&amp;nbsp;°F).

After receiving his doctorate, Moore created new designs in spectroscopy and [[fluorometry]] as Director of Product Development at Spex Industries in [[Metuchen, New Jersey]]. In 1976 he joined EMI Medical, the inventor of [[X-ray computed tomography|X-ray CT scanning]], in [[Northbrook, Illinois]].  There, he advanced to Vice-President of Engineering, and built the team that created the first CT scanner to take a picture in under 3 seconds.  When EMI got out of the medical electronics business, he founded Bio-Imaging Research ([[Lincolnshire, Illinois]]).  Initially, BIR created the world's first one-second CT scanner for [[Toshiba]], and then branched into [[MRI]], [[ultrasound]], and industrial x-ray scanners, including the megavolt x-ray systems that inspect trucks and cargo containers at ports and border crossings. He was awarded the Chicago Area High-Tech Entrepreneur of the Year in 1987 and 1989.  In 2006, he sold BIR's medical division to Toshiba Medical, and in 2007 sold its industrial and security divisions to [[Varian Medical Systems]].

Moore served on several standards committees for medical imaging, and was Chairman of the Surface Weapons Board of the U.S. Naval Research Advisory Committee.  He has published and presented numerous papers, including before the [[World Health Organization]] in [[Geneva]].  He recently retired after 27 years on the board of [[TC Manufacturing]], and consults in medical and radiation physics.

He had five children (Robin [deceased], Sheila, Marjorie, Deborah [deceased], and Laurel) by his first marriage in 1948 to Joan Elizabeth Sanders (1928–1998), and two children (Jonathan Moore and [[Cris Moore]]) by his second marriage in 1963 to Betty-Ann Jorgensen (1938- ).  He collected original-cast musical comedy recordings  and license plates, and his other interests included N-scale model railroading, mathematical games, and science fiction.

'''Leader development''' is defined as the "expansion of a person's capacity to be effective in leadership roles and processes" (McCauley, Van Veslor, &amp; Rudeman, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;2). These roles and processes are ones that aid in setting direction, creating alignment and maintaining commitment in groups of people sharing common work. Most organizational leadership research and educational programs have focused on developing individual-based knowledge, skills, and abilities associated with formal leadership roles ([[human capital]]) of individuals (Day, 2000). Leader development therefore results by investing in human capital.

==Developmental theory==
While there is no specific theory from which leader development derives, [[developmental theory]] taps into two aspects of development: learning and change. Development is a form of change and it is impossible for a leader to develop without change occurring (Day &amp; Zacarro, 2004). Learning is defined as the attainment of a permanent change in a person because of practice or experience, which then drives change and development (Day &amp; Zacarro, 2004). Learning stems from two traditions: a permanent change in behavior following experience based on [[behaviorism]], and a change in or creation of new mental models based on [[Gestalt psychology]]. Behaviorism allows for performance to be used as an indicator of a leader's behavior. In contrast, Gestalt psychology examines the creation of new mental models that arise from experience, which can help a leader develop their intrapersonal competence. Together, behaviorism and Gestalt traditions are thought to be complementary in the fact that development comes from both changing mental models and creating new behaviors (Hogan and Warrenfeltz, 2003).

==Differentiating between leader development and leadership development==
Leader development is described as one aspect of the broader process of [[leadership development]] (McCauley et al., 2010). Leadership development is defined as the expansion of a group's capacity to produce direction, alignment, and commitment (McCauley et al.), in contrast to leader development which is the expansion of a one's ability to be effective in leadership roles and processes. Further distinctions between the two can be made by looking at components of each model. Leader development focuses on developing individual knowledge, skills, and abilities (human capital), whereas leadership development focuses on building networked relationships ([[social capital]]) among individuals in an organization. Leader development keys in on the assumption that effective leadership occurs through the development of individual leaders, whereas leadership development is a function of the social resources that are rooted in relationships (Day, 2000). In leader development, the focus is on intrapersonal skills of self-awareness, self-regulation, and self-motivation; leadership development focuses on [[interpersonal]] skills of social awareness and [[social skill]]s (Day, 2000). Day (2000) argues that what most organizations term as leadership development should be more accurately labeled as leader development. Organizations cannot choose one or the other approach, but instead a bridge must be anchored on either side of leader and leadership development for effective development to occur (Kegan, 1994). Therefore, it is important to develop the intrapersonal capabilities to serve as a foundation for interpersonal competence and link both leader and leadership development together.

==Differentiating between leader development and management development==
[[Management development]] and leadership development can often be confused as one. Although they also can overlap, there are key differences between the two that are not to get confused with leader development. Leadership processes allow groups of people to work together, whereas management processes are considered to be position and organization specific (Keys &amp; Wolf, 1988). Management development includes managerial education and training (Latham &amp; Seijts, 1998; Mailick, Stumpf, Grant, Kfir, &amp; Watson, 1998). There is a greater emphasis on gaining specific types of knowledge, skills,and abilities to enhance task performance in management roles (Baldwin &amp; Padgett,1994; Keys &amp; Wolfe, 1988; Wexley &amp; Baldwin, 1986). Also, management development's goal is to apply proven solutions to problems giving it more of a training orientation. Management development focuses more on the formal managerial roles.

==Leader development model==
McCauley, Van Veslor, and Ruderman (2010) explain a two-part model for developing leaders. The first part illustrates three elements that combine to make developmental experiences stronger: assessment, challenge and support. Assessment lets leaders know where they stand in areas of strengths, current performance level, and developmental needs. Challenging experiences are ones that stretch a leader's ability to work outside of their comfort zone, develop new skills and abilities, and provide important opportunities to learn. Support, which comes in the form of bosses, co-workers, friends, family, coaches and [[mentors]], enables leaders to handle the struggle of developing.  
The second part of the leader development model (McCauley et al., 2010) illustrates that the leader development process involves a variety of developmental experiences and the ability to learn from them. These experiences and the ability to learn also affect each other in that a leader with a high ability to learn will search for developmental experiences and through developmental experiences leaders will increase their ability to learn. It is also important to note that the leader development process is rooted in a particular leadership context which includes elements such as age, [[culture]], economic conditions, gender of the population, organizational purpose and mission, and business strategy (McCauley et al.). This environment molds the leader development process. Along with assessment, challenge and support, leadership context are important aspects of the leader development model.

==YGLP==
[[YGLP]] is an international leadership program for [[university]] and [[high school]] students aiming to groom young minds into exemplary leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.timeskuwait.com/Times_Two-Kuwait-cities-selected-to-host-YGLP-Asia-2017-18| title=Two Kuwait cities selected to host YGLP Asia 2017-18 |work=Kuwait Times | access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[YGLP]] was developed by Human Science Lab, London, with support from several transnational organizations and foundations. The objective behind creation of [[YGLP]] was to come up with a path-breaking [[leadership]] model that could be used across the globe to create a new generation of leaders who can push the limit of human accomplishments to new frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.bfirst.in/news/bengaluru/20445/bengaluru-selected-host-yglp-asia-2017-18| title=Bengaluru selected to host YGLP Asia 2017-18|publisher=Bfirst News Network | access-date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Four-Step Leadership theory formulated under the HSL Leadership Project at Human Science Lab, London, provides the [[scientific]] framework for [[YGLP]]. The theory stipulates that "the leadership achievement of an individual is proportional to the optimal use of four principal components that makes a leader –motivation, planning, energising and executing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk/outreach| title=YGLP Leadership Program |publisher=www.humansciencelab.org.uk | access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YGLP contains four core modules and one non-core module. Each core module is designed to optimise one of the four [[leadership]] component enumerated in the Four-Step Leadership Principle i.e. motivating, planning, energising and executing.

==Intrapersonal competencies==
There are three types of intrapersonal competencies related to leader development: self-awareness (emotional awareness, self-confidence, and accurate self-image), self-regulation (self-control, trustworthiness, adaptability and personal responsibility), and self-motivation (commitment, initiative, and optimism) (Day, 2000).

===Self-awareness===
In today's changing environment, the two personal capabilities that allow a leader to learn new skills or competencies are '''[[self-awareness]]''' (identity) and adaptability (Briscoe &amp; Hall, 1999; Hall, 1986a, 1986b, 2002). Leader development is personal development and involves the process of becoming more aware of one's self (Hall, 2004). Self-awareness is the extent to which people are conscious of various aspects of their identities and the extent to which their self-perceptions are congruent with the way others perceive them (Hall, 2004). Self-awareness has been referred to as "the first component of emotional intelligence" and discusses how it is "the ability to recognize and understand your moods, emotions, and drives, as well as their effects on others" (Goleman, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;95). This is vital for a leader to be able to evaluate themselves to recognize their impact on their thinking and decisions as well as on other individuals.

===Self-regulation===
'''Self-regulation''' has been conceptualized in proposed models by Tsui and Ashford (1994) as well as Wood and Bandura (1989). The models have some differences but agree on a fundamental sequence where individuals (a) regulate their attention and effort around self-set goals or assigned goals, (b) take action to achieve their goals, (c) obtain their goals or their performance strategy, if necessary, to maintain or enhance their progress toward their goals and (e) recommence the cycle. Tsui and Ashford (1994) describe the procedure as setting the goal, behaving, detecting a discrepancy, and lastly reducing any discrepancy. This process is vital in leader development because it can have both internal and external effects. As Sosik, Potosky, and Jung (2002) stated that, "individuals desire congruence between their own and others’ perceptions of their behavior, and, therefore, set and work toward goals to reduce perceptual discrepancies, gain congruence, and improve their effectiveness" (p.&amp;nbsp;212). This is similar to the intrapersonal competence of self-awareness as individuals want their own perception of themselves be congruent with those of others, both outlining importance for leader development.

===Self-motivation===
'''Self-motivation''' involves having higher levels of identification to be motivated to go beyond contracts and exchanges in both their own development and performance (Hall, 2004). 
Together, the capabilities of self-awareness, self-regulation and self-motivation allow for enhanced individual knowledge, trust, and personal power, which can be seen as fundamental to create in a leader (Zand, 1997).

==Modes of development==
Leader development takes place through multiple mechanisms: formal instruction, developmental job assignments, [[360-degree feedback]], [[executive coaching]], and self-directed learning (Boyce, Zaccaro &amp; Wisecarver, 2009; Day, 2000). These mechanisms may occur independently, but are more effective in combination.

===Formal training===
Organizations often offer '''formal training''' programs to their leaders. Traditional styles provide leaders with required knowledge and skills in a particular area by utilizing coursework, practice, "[[overlearning]]" with rehearsals, and feedback (Kozlowski, 1998). This traditional lecture-based classroom training is useful, however, the limitations include the leader's ability to transfer the information from a training environment to a work setting.

===Developmental job assignments===
Following formal training organizations should assign leaders to '''developmental jobs''' that target the newly acquired skills (Zacarro &amp; Banks, 2004). A job that is developmental is one in which leaders  learn, undergo personal change, and gain leadership skills resulting from the roles, responsibilities and tasks involved in that job (McCauley &amp; Brutus, 1998). Developmental job assignments are one of the most effective forms of leader development (Ohlott, 2004). After training a leader should first complete a "stamping-in" assignment". A "stamping-in" assignment is one in which the leader masters the new skills before moving on to a "stretch assignment" (Zacarro &amp; Banks). The "stretch" or developmental assignment challenges the leader's new skills and pushes them out of their comfort zone to operate in a more complex environment involving new elements, problems and dilemmas to resolve (Ohlott, 2004). A truly development assignment doesn’t depend on existing skills, it challenges the leader to understand his or her current limitations and develop new skills (Zaccaro &amp; Banks). These assignments should be given to leaders who do not possess the skills to succeed at the current assignment, but who have the ability to succeed at higher levels (Zaccarro &amp; Banks). Developmental assignments should be accompanied by appropriate feedback that assesses the leader's strengths and weaknesses in order to be successful (Zaccaro &amp; Banks).

===Three hundred and sixty-degree feedback===
'''Three hundred and sixty-degree feedback''' is a necessary component of leader development which allows leaders to maximize learning opportunities from their current assignment. It systematically provides the leader with perceptions of his or her performance from a full circle of viewpoints including subordinates, peers, superiors (Day, 2000), and the leader's own [[self-assessment]] (Zaccaro &amp; Banks, 2004). With many different sources from which to interpret information, the messages may differ and be difficult to interpret. However, when several different sources concur on a similar perspective, whether a strength or weakness, the clarity of the message increases (King &amp; Santana, 2010). For this mechanism to be effective, the leader must accept feedback and be open and willing to make changes. An effective way to facilitate the feedback through open discussion and to help facilitate change is through coaching (Day, 2000).

===Executive coaching===
The goal of '''executive coaching''' focuses on enhancing the leader's effectiveness along with the effectiveness of the team and organization (Frankovelgia &amp; Riddle, 2010). It involves an intense one-on-one relationship designed at learning important lessons through assessment, challenge, and support. Although coaching is sometimes aimed at correcting a fault, it is being used more and more to help already successful leaders move to the next level of increased responsibilities, and new and complex challenges. Coaching must move toward measurable goals that contribute to individual and organizational growth. Day (2000) proposes that leaders should be carefully selected, willing to change, and matched with a compatible coach in order for coaching to be most effective.

===Self-directed learning===
'''Self-directed learning''' is an individual leader's aim in identifying the focus of development, specifying the developmental processes, and identifying the resources (Boyce, Zaccaro, &amp; Wisecarver, 2010). Self-development is the process of not only acquiring new skills but also gaining an understanding of the leader's environment and self through new experiences and activities, such as seeking out mentors or developmental job assignments (Boyce, Zaccaro, &amp; Wisecarver, 2010).

==Application==
The Army has been conducting leader development studies since as early as 1971; studies include a review of education and training for Army officers, and professional development of officers, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers. In 1987, the Army Chief of Staff directed a comprehensive leader development study to be conducted which produced the Army's  leader development system, a support system to monitor and adapt to the effects of change on Army leader development, and a leader development action plan (U.S. Army, 1994). The U.S. Army Research Institute's (ARI) research topics include training, leader development, and soldier research and development. One area ARI's leadership development program focuses on is ways to provide accelerated development of Army leaders.

'''Linda Lappin''' is a [[poet]], [[novelist]], and [[translator]] born in [[Tennessee]] in 1953. She received a [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] from the [[University of Iowa]] Writers Workshop in 1978.  During her years at Iowa, she specialized in poetry with Florida poet [[Donald Justice]]. Her first volume of poetry, ''Wintering with the Abominable Snowman'', was published in 1976 by the [[avant-garde]] press, 'kayak,' run by [[George Hitchcock (poet)|George Hitchcock]] in [[Santa Cruz, California]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Sims Sandy, Interview with Linda Lappin, The Writer's Chronicle, AWP, March/April 2010, Vol.42, n.5, pp. 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

She received a [[Fulbright grant]] in 1978 to participate in a two-year Fulbright seminar in literary translation held in Rome at the [[Centro Studi Americani]], under the directorship of [[Frank MacShane]] of [[Columbia University]] and [[William Weaver]], the noted translator from Italian. The project pursued by Lappin in those years, a translation from the Italian of [[Carmelo Samonà']]s novel, ''Brothers'', won two prizes in literary translation in the United States: The Renato Poggioli Award in Translation from Italian given by the New York PEN club and a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] grant in translation in 1987. She was awarded a second translation grant from the NEA in 1996 for her work on Tuscan writer  [[Federigo Tozzi]]. From 1987 to the year 2000, she published [[essays]], [[Poetry|poems]], [[reviews]], and [[short stories]] in many US and European publications, including several essays on women writers and artists of the 1920s, including ''Missing Person in Montparnasse'', in the Literary Review, about the life of [[Jeanne Hébuterne]], "Jane Heap and her Circle" in Prairie Schooner, dealing with the lives of [[Jane Heap]] and [[Margaret C. Anderson|Margaret Anderson]], founders of [[the Little Review]] and "Dada Queen in the Bad Boys' Club, Baroness [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven|Elsa Von Freitag Loringhoven]]" in Southwest Review.

Major themes in Lappin's work include women's [[biographies]] and [[autobiographies]], expatriate writers in the 1920s, and displacement.

==Novels==
In ''The Etruscan'', her first novel, Harriet Sackett, a [[feminist]] [[photographer]], travels to [[Italy]] to photograph [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] tombs for the  [[Theosophical Society]]. Here she falls in love with a charismatic count, the occultist and amateur archaeologist, Federigo del Re, who materializes and disappears into the Etruscan landscape.  As Harriet stalks her phantasm-lover, the solution to the mystery which propels the novel retreats. Is Federigo Del Re faithful; is he a real count, or even a real man; a fantasy or an Etruscan ghost? The novel draws inspiration from the literary [[gothic novel]], [[Jungian archetypes]], [[fairy tales]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url= http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/prairie_schooner/v079/79.4tekulve.html| author =Susan Tekulve|title=The Etruscan by Linda Lappin| journal="Prairie Schooner"|date= Autumn 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and from [[DH Lawrence]]'s ''[[Sketches of Etruscan Places and other Italian essays|Sketches of Etruscan Places]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rosati, Alessandro, ''Echi di D.H. Lawrence in "The Etruscan" di Linda Lappin'',  tesi di laurea, Università degli Studi dell Tuscia, Viterbo, Italy, 2006, pp. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Critically, ''The Etruscan'' has been analyzed as a recapitulation of the entire tradition of English/American fiction set in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Prampolini, Gaetano,  "The Etruscan di Linda Lappin,"  ''Oltre il Racconto'' Venice: Mazzanti editore, pp. 137 -149&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary about the book entitled ''A Tale of Tuscia'', directed by Sergio Baldassarre, is available.

Lappin's second novel, ''Katherine's Wish'', is a meta-fictional re-elaboration of textual documentation pertaining to the final phase of [[Katherine Mansfield]]'s life. Written from three points of view, that of Katherine Mansfield, of her companion, Ida Baker,  and of her husband, John Middleton Murry, Katherine's Wish recreates a slice of Mansfield's life from 1918 until her retreat to [[Fontainebleau]], to [[Gurdjieff]]'s Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man in 1922, where she died in 1923. The novel focuses on Mansfield's triangular relationship with Ida Baker and Middleton Murry while tracing her artistic and spiritual quest.

Lappin's third novel ''Signatures in Stone'' Caravel Books 2013 is set in the Monster Park of Bomarzo, and draws inspiration from the early twentieth century British writer, Mary Butts.

'''Mark A. Hardy''' is Auchincloss Professor of Surgery, Director Emeritus of the Transplant Centre, and Vice Chairman and Residency Program Director of the Department of Surgery at the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] and [[NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital]] in New York City.

Hardy is most recognized for co-founding the New York Organ Donor Network in 1978 (NYODN 2006). In addition to his work in transplantation, in the earlier part of his career he made several contributions to the development of prosthetic vascular grafts and the development and studies of biologic function of [[thymic]] hormones, both experimentally and clinically.

Hardy laid another cornerstone of [[organ transplant]] medicine by helping found the program for dialysis and kidney transplantation at [[NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital]]. He based the new program on the principle of combined clinical care between surgeons and nephrologists during a time when [[renal transplant]] programs were managed by one or the other discipline, never by both at once (CUMC Programs 2007). This cooperation between disciplines led to major contributions in [[immunogenetics]], [[immunosuppression]], and treatment of autoimmune diseases and [[lymphoma]] (CUMC Programs 2007).

His most recent focus has been on cellular transplantation with emphasis on islet transplantation. Hardy is Principal Investigator of a multicenter clinical trial exploring a combination of two immunosuppressant drugs, sirolimus and tacrolimus (CUMC 2007 Kidney). He also currently a member of several multiinstitutional studies of immunosuppressive agents which are individually sponsored by [[Novartis]], [[Astellas]] and [[Bristol Myers]].

==Honors==
Hardy has been a professor in about 30 institutions and delivered over 10 eponymous lectures worldwide. He has received honoraria for lectures in the past from [[Upjohn]], Sangstat, [[Hoffmann-La Roche]], [[Novartis]], [[Astellas]], and Gore.

==History==
MEA was founded in 1852 as the Michigan State Teachers Association, five years before the National Education Association was organized, becoming the Michigan Education Association in 1926. Today it is the largest public employee union in the state and the third largest education association in the United States.

In 1937 the MEA’s governing body, the Representative Assembly, authorized the development of a group hospitalization program.&lt;ref&gt;“A Chronology of Michigan Education and the Michigan Education Association 1817-1966,” compiled by Octavius Townsend, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the first such [[health care]] programs in the United States. Two years later, the Hoosier Casualty Company provided coverage for MEA members, administrated by local insurance agent Herman Henkel.

Michigan law forbade the MEA from acting as an agent for its members, so when Henkel retired in 1960, it was decided that a separate non-profit corporation would serve this function, and Michigan Education Special Services Association (MESSA) was born. 10,000 MEA members were enrolled at the time.

Tax-exempt under IRS 501(c)(9), MESSA qualified as a “voluntary employees’ beneficiary association” and could therefore offer group term life, health, and dental coverages, among others, to its members.

When the Michigan bargaining law was enacted in 1965, public school employees were able to organize into local bargaining units to negotiate salary, benefits and other working conditions. Insurance became a bargainable issue.&lt;ref&gt;Michigan PA 379 of 1965 -- This drove MESSA enrollment growth, which reached 70,000 by 1979.

In 1984, MEA merged with the Michigan Educational Support Personnel, making MEA one of the first state associations to represent both teachers and other school personnel. In 2007, MEA membership exceeded 160,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mea.org/about/officers.html MEA - About - Our Leaders&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italictitle}}
'''''My Mom's Having a Baby''''' is a children's book that was written by [[Dori Hillestad Butler]] and Illustrated by Carol Thompson. The book was published by Albert Whitman &amp; Company in 2005, but was banned in several states due to its content. It was the fourth most censored book in the United States in 2011 and is regarded as a highly controversial piece of children's literature. 

==Plot==
''My Mom's Having a Baby'' is narrated by a young girl named Elizabeth whose mother is pregnant with another child. Elizabeth takes the reader through the nine months of her mother's pregnancy and explains everything that she learns along the way. At first Elizabeth learns about doctor's visits and ultrasounds, and eventually she learns the facts of life from her mother. When Elizabeth's mother is in the hospital having the baby Elizabeth stays with her grandmother, and in the end Elizabeth is thrilled to introduce her new little brother Michael.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Dori|title=My Mom's Having a Baby|date=2005|publisher=Albert Whitman &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship==
''My Mom's Having a Baby'' was censored in Oregon, Indiana, Kansas, Colorado, Georgia, Nevada, Texas, and Florida. It was the fourth most censored book in the United States in 2011, and was censored for nudity, sex education, and unsuitability to the age group.&lt;ref name = banned&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Kristen|title=Banned Books Month: Guest Post from Dori Hillestad Butler: How Censorship Has Changed Me|url=http://www.ekristinanderson.com/?p=7651|website=Write All the Words!|publisher=Kristen Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book contains nudity in order to provide a detailed description of how babies are created. The amount of detail in the explanation provided in the story has created controversy among parents due to the accuracy with which Butler describes the act of sex. The illustrations are controversial because they depict both male and female nudity, as well as the parents together under the covers in a way that implies they are having sex.

In an interview with ''Fox News'', Butler defended her work by stating that it is in the children's non-fiction section along with other explanatory children's books about childbirth, disease, and war. She stated that her book was meant to be explained to a child by a parent, and that parents should not assume that every book in the children's section can or should be read without supervision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Butler|first1=Dori|title=Is Children's Book Too Graphic for Kids?|url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/4554700/is-childrens-book-too-graphic-for-kids/?#sp=show-clips|website=Fox News|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=February 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
''My Mom's Having a Baby'' received a starred review from Booklist, and was Booklist Editor's Choice Book for 2005 directly after its publication. It is also a Top Ten Science - Technology award winner.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Butler states in her post as a guest blogger on ''Write All the Words!'' that she explained sex to her children in the very same way that she explains it in the book.&lt;ref name = banned/&gt;

The '''Owatonna Art Education Project''' was a project in [[Owatonna, Minnesota]] in the United States, intended to promote the production of new knowledge through science, establish standards of excellence in education, and provide opportunities for self-improvement and visual enhancement. It was started 1933 and continued until 1938. The findings were published in 1944.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31737">'''Positive education''' is an approach to [[education]] that draws on [[positive psychology]]'s emphasis of individual strengths and personal motivation to promote [[learning]].  Unlike traditional school approaches in which [[teacher]]s attempt to tailor their material to a mythical "average" [[student]], and move the [[class (education)|class]] altogether using the material through one teaching and testing style, positive schooling teachers use techniques that focus on the well-being of individual students.&lt;ref name="chen"&gt;Chen, J., &amp; Mcnamee, G. (2011). "Positive approaches to learning in the context of preschool classroom activities", "Early Childhood Education Journal", 39(1): 71-78.&lt;/ref&gt;  Teachers use methods such as developing tailored goals for each student to engender learning and working with them to develop the plans and motivation to reach their goals.  Rather than pushing students to achieve at a set grade level, seen through the emphasis of [[standardized test]]ing, this approach attempts to customize learning goals to individual students' levels. Instead of setting students to compete against one another, learning is viewed as a cooperative process where teachers learn to respect their students and each student's input is valued.&lt;ref name="jigsaw"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Walker, I., &amp; Crogan, M.|year=1998|title=Academic performance, prejudice, and the jigsaw classroom: New pieces to the puzzle|journal=Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology|volume=8|issue=6|pages=381–393|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-1298(199811/12)8:6&lt;381::aid-casp457&gt;3.3.co;2-y|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246868865_Academic_performance_prejudice_and_the_Jigsaw_Classroom_New_pieces_to_the_puzzle|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630172439/http://uwf.edu/svodanov/as/jigsaw.pdf|archivedate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical approaches ==
Several early [[psychologist]]s and thinkers paved the way for the incorporation of positive psychology techniques, though they may not have yet been labeled as such, in the classroom.  [[John Dewey]] was among the earliest advocates to impact the field of positive schooling.  John Dewey recognized schools as primary institutions for the development of [[democracy]]. He opposed the repressive atmosphere of schools, especially elementary and secondary schools, and emphasized the importance of promoting learners' ability to absorb and recreate information in their minds.  He put forth the idea of [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]], which argues that individual learners should take information and creatively construct it according to their own personal capacities and views. This approach opposes the traditional view of education in which teachers pass down knowledge to the students through direct communication.  In summary, Dewey's view of education, similar to [[progressive education]] implies that people learn best in environments that are applicable to the real world and that allow them to learn through activities and practical problem solving.&lt;ref name="Dewey 1916"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=J|title=Democracy and Education|year=1916|publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maria Montessori]], the originator of the [[Montessori method|Montessori system]], put forth views relating to positive schooling as well.  The Montessori system is largely based on the positive psychology principle of creativity.  Creativity, known as one of the twenty-four character strengths,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meaningandhappiness.com/psychology-research/list-of-personal-strengths.html#list-of-personal-strengths|title=List of Character Strengths|accessdate=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is offered with the freedom for children to choose how they learn, known as [[autodidactism|self-directed learning]].  Children are provided with hands-on materials, which not only inspires creativity, but also stimulates interest in learning, as children are able to express themselves through learning, rather than feeling forced to work in order to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Montessori Method|author=Maria Montessori|pages=79&amp;ndash;81|publisher=Random House|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth Hurlock was one of the first psychologists to actually carry out experiments with positive psychology techniques to measure the effects of positive schooling in the field of education.  Hurlock studied the effectiveness of [[praise]] and reproach in the classroom, arguing that praise was a more effective long-term incentive.  Her studies found that praise was more effective for children regardless of age, ability and gender.&lt;ref name="hurlock"/&gt;

Jeniffer Henderlong and Mark Lepper echo Hurlock's arguments that praise is beneficial to enhancing children's intrinsic motivation.  Although some research doubts the effectiveness of praise, appropriate use of praise is proven to be positively correlated with confidence and better academic performance results. They support that praise increases the personal beliefs about one's ability to perform given tasks.  Also, [[cognitive evaluation theory]] supports that praise enhances individuals' perception about performance outcomes and that positive moods induced by praise may contribute to effective outcomes.&lt;ref name="praise"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henderlong, J., &amp; Lepper, M.|year=2002|title=The effects of praise on children's intrinsic motivation: A review and synthesis|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=128|issue=5|pages=774–795|pmid=12206194|url=http://www.reed.edu/motivation/docs/PraiseReview.pdf|doi= 10.1037//0033-2909.128.5.774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Chickering and Zelda Gamson focus on the [[pedagogy]], the teacher's "how," rather than content and subject matter being taught, which is partly due to the scarce [[empirical research]] that has been done on college [[curriculum]].  Chickering and Gamson give seven research-supported principles regarding education and learning in the [[undergraduate]] environment for teachers to follow:
# Teachers are to encourage contact between students and faculty.  Chickering and Gamson explain that student-faculty relationships give students motivation to keep working hard to strive for future goals and also provide support and resources.
# To develop reciprocity and cooperation among students, promoting a [[collaborative learning]] environment, rather than a competitive one.  This gives students opportunities to work together and learn from one another, which has been shown to strengthen understanding.
# Teachers are to use active learning techniques, relating material to topics that students already have an interest in and getting students to ask, "What does this concept look like in my own life?"
# Teachers are to give prompt feedback.  Balancing assessment and feedback results in efficient learning, as students realize what they do and do not know and learn to assess themselves.
# Emphasizing time on task, or sharing effective time management strategies to give students an understanding for their time expectations.
# Communicating high expectations has shown to be very successful.  Expectations that teachers implement give students a gage for how much potential they think that they have.
# Respecting students' diverse talents and ways of learning accounts for all learning styles and allows students to figure out how they learn best.&lt;ref name="chickering"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Chickering, A., &amp; Gamson, Z.|year=1987|title=Seven principles for good practice in undergraduate education|journal=AAHE Bulletin|volume=3|url=https://www.uwo.ca/tsc/resources/pdf/SevenPrinciples.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliot Aronson has pioneered the [[jigsaw (teaching technique)|jigsaw classroom]], a theoretical approach for 3rd-12th grade classes which emphasizes the individual academic strengths of children and seeks to make them peer-teachers in a cooperative learning setting. In this approach, students are divided into competency groups of four to six students; individual group members then break off and work with "experts" on their topic from the other groups, researching together that specific section of material. These students then return to their groups and present on their part of the material. This approach encourages group engagement, listening, and cooperation among peers, as well as incorporates an aspects of play into learning. It as shown positive effects on academic performance and liking for school and peers.&lt;ref name="jigsaw"/&gt;  This may be because increased liking leads to [[self-esteem]], which if absent, can affect academic performance.  It is also possible that jigsaw methods help to increase participation while reducing [[anxiety]], lead to increases [[empathy]], and result in changes in attributions of success and failures.  The Jigsaw method has been proposed as a strategy to improve [[race relations]] since it meets the criteria posed by contact theory for reducing racial prejudice.  [[Contact hypothesis|Intergroup contact theory]] states that interracial contact will only improve race relations if ethnic groups are of equal status, pursue a common goal of mutual interest for groups, and are sanctioned by institutions.&lt;ref name="Dewey 1916"/&gt;

Another model that utilizes positive education in school is the [[response to intervention]] model. Response to intervention is a preventative model that works to provide tailored assistance to at-risk students who are exhibiting insufficient academic achievement, though its principles have been used to address behavioral issues as well.  The central components of this model include a core curriculum based on scientific evidence, universal screening, progress monitoring, and decisions about acceptable progress in subsequent tiers.  RTI utilizes a multi-tiered structure: at each tier, students are screened and then monitored.  The model was originally created to help identify [[learning disabilities]], so that the adoption of a core curriculum ensures that inadequate teaching is not the cause for poor performance.  Those who struggle even when adhering to a research-supported curriculum are given more intense instruction at a higher tier.  When behavior is being considered, school or local norms for behavior rates are used when screening.&lt;ref name="hughes"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hughes, C., &amp; Dexter, D.|year=2011|title=Response to Intervention: A Research-Based Summary|journal=Theory Into Practice|volume=50|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.1080/00405841.2011.534909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Positive Behavioral Support (PBS) model is structured similarly to RTI but addresses behavior problems.  This model adopts a prevention and intervention approach, emphasizing the importance of building [[prosocial skills]], in addition to reducing bad behavior while implementing a three-tiered "continuum of supports" from a universal to an individual level.  The strategies at the universal level include defined expected behaviors, strategies to teach expected behavior, strategies to encourage and practice appropriate behavior, and consistency within and across school systems.  The second level involves providing targeted support for individuals and groups that are at risk.  The final level concerns individuals that persist in their bad behavior and involves functional behavior assessments, instruction-based plans, and collective comprehensive plans including families and community agencies.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Lewis, T., Powers, L., Kelk, M., &amp; Newcomer, L.|year=2002|title=Reducing problem behaviors on the playground: An investigation of the application of schoolwide positive behavior supports|journal=Psychology in the Schools Special Issue: Development, Evaluation, and Treatment of Students with Behavior Disorders|volume=39|issue=2|pages=181–190|doi= 10.1002/pits.10029}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PBS can be implemented at a school-wide, district-wide or even statewide level.  Recently, local school systems and even state departments of education have been demonstrating a rising interest in PBS because the program requires little training time and limited money and staff.&lt;ref name="Barrett"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Barrett, S., Bradshaw, C., &amp; Lewis-Palmer, T.|year=2008|title=Maryland statewide PBIS initiative: Systems, evaluation, and next steps|journal=Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions|volume=10|issue=2|pages=105–114|doi=10.1177/1098300707312541}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, the New Hampshire Department of Education organized a statewide initiative to introduce PBS into New Hampshire schools.&lt;ref name="Muscott"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Muscott, H., Mann, E., &amp; LeBrun, M.|year=2008|title=Positive behavioral interventions and supports in new hampshire: Effects of large-scale implementation of schoolwide positive behavior support on student discipline and academic achievement|journal=Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions|volume=10|issue=3|pages=190–205|doi=10.1177/1098300708316258|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240286666_Positive_Behavioral_Interventions_and_Supports_in_New_Hampshire_Effects_of_Large-Scale_Implementation_of_Schoolwide_Positive_Behavior_Support_on_Student_Discipline_and_Academic_Achievement}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PBS has also become popular in Maryland, as more than 33% of state's schools implemented the program in 2006.&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt;

== Empirical findings ==
One major empirical finding in support for positive learning techniques has been the positive effect of praise-based [[discipline]] techniques in classrooms. Elizabeth Hurlock studied the day-to-day improvement of students who were praised, reproached, and ignored.  Students were divided into these groups in addition to a [[control group]] after they had been administered an arithmetic test, and were subsequently tested each day over an additional period of four days.  After the first testing session, the control group was tested in a separate room from the other groups.  In the treatment room, the "praise" group of students were invited to the front of the room and praised for their work as well as encouraged to do better.  The "reproach" group was called up and reproved for their poor performance, while the ignored group received no recognition.  Some significant findings include the fact that the praised group experienced the most initial improvement, followed by the reproach group and then the ignored group, while no improvement was seen in the control group.  The ignored and control group also showed a decrease in accuracy towards the end of the testing period.  When children were grouped according to academic achievement into the categories "superior", "average" and "inferior" after the first test, praise was the most influential [[incentive]] for all students, though it was most effective for the "inferior" group.  As a whole, the results suggested that praise was the most accurate incentive regardless of age, sex, initial ability, or accuracy.&lt;ref name="hurlock"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hurlock, E.|year=1925|title=An evaluation of certain incentives used in school work|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=16|issue=3|pages=145–159|doi=10.1037/h0067716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While empirical evidence supports the positive effects of praise, there exists a debate regarding whether the jigsaw classroom method is successful in various areas.  Two studies by Christopher Bratt, who was interested in the jigsaw classroom's ability to improve prejudice based on [[ethnicity]], examined the effects of the jigsaw classroom method on intergroup relations; yet, no positive effects were found.  The first studied the method's effect on majority members' [[ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] attitudes, attitudes towards school [[empathy]], and intergroup friendships by examining two jigsaw classrooms and two regular classrooms of multi-ethnic 6th graders.  The second measured [[common ingroup identity]] in the majority sample and outgroup attitudes in the minority sample in addition to the previous variables in a sample of 8th–10th graders in 46 multi-ethnic classrooms, utilizing a matched pair design between jigsaw and regular classrooms.  No evidence of any significant effects of the jigsaw method was found in the second study, while outgroup attitudes improved in study 1.  Yet, Bratt believed the findings from study 1 were spurious, arguing that the fact that one of the classrooms in study 1 was taught by two teachers while the others had one teacher may have influenced the results.&lt;ref name="bratt"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bratt, C.|year=2008|title=The jigsaw classroom under test: No effect on intergroup relations evident|journal=Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology|volume=18|issue=5|pages=403–419|doi=10.1002/casp.946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Walker &amp; Crogan yielded evidence that supported the utility of the jigsaw classroom.  The study investigated the relationship between teaching methods such as [[cooperative learning]] and the jigsaw classroom and outcomes in academic performance, [[self-esteem]], attitude of school, attitude of peers, and racial prejudice.  The study was designed to investigate solely the jigsaw classroom method, yet one of the teachers altered her mode of instruction due to the behavior of disruptive students so that it resembled [[cooperative learning]].  As a result, the experimenters modified their objectives, believing they could compare the effectiveness of [[cooperation]], necessary in both methods, and task interdependence, characteristics only of the jigsaw classroom.  They concluded that academic performance, liking of peers, and racial prejudice improved under the jigsaw classroom method while cooperative learning appeared to intensify intergroup tension, yet major methodological issues may cast doubt on the validity of these findings.  Many of the classrooms did not adhere very strictly to proper plan for implementation of the jigsaw classroom and the researchers had to abandon their original design.  Also, the fact that one of the teachers had to forgo the jigsaw classroom method due to student misbehavior is telling.&lt;ref name="jigsaw"/&gt;  Bratt argues that studies professing results that support improved intergroup relations are similarly flawed.&lt;ref name="bratt" /&gt;

The [[Circle of Courage]] curriculum is, yet, another practical attempt for implementing positive learning techniques.  Deborah Espiner and Diane Guild monitor the progress and success of Mt. Richmond Special School after implementing the Circle of Courage curriculum and [[Response-Ability|Response Ability Pathways]] (RAP) program.  The Circle of Courage is an educational philosophy based on [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] values.  Belonging, mastery, independence, and generosity are four core values that are intended to integrate [[Western culture|Western]] and indigenous cultures.  The school managers established a positive learning environment based on these two programs, which were designed for dynamic interaction between teachers and students.  Before launching the actual classroom environment, five months were taken to introduce new learning methods to school staff and students.  In general, participants acknowledged that new modules brought positive impact in the school.  One recognizable outcome was that RAP training facilitated the connection between teachers and challenging students.  Additionally, new positive education methods also led teachers to discover the potentials of their pupils.&lt;ref name="circle"&gt;{{cite book|author=Espiner, D., &amp; Guild, D.|year=2010|title=Growing a circle of courage culture: One's school's journey|journal=Bloomington|volume=19|issue=2|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When examining programs that attempt to help children overcome behavioral issues that prevent them from displaying their full potential, research has provided support for the efficacy of PBS.  A study by Barrett and Lewis-Palmer investigated the statewide implementation of PBS in 467 schools.&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt;  The results indicated that overall, the program had been successfully implemented and displayed high fidelity to the theoretical model.  Elementary schools reported 43% less office discipline referrals (ODRs) per day, while middle schools reported 37% less ODRs per day and K-(8–12) schools reported 72% less ODRs per day when compared with the national averages.  Schools also demonstrated significant reductions in suspension rates in as little as one year.  Another study by Muscott and Mann examined the first cohort of 28 New Hampshire early childhood education programs and K-12 schools that had implemented PBS in accordance with the directive of the Department of Education.  Within three months after the program was introduced, 54% of schools met the standards of successful PBS implementation and 88% of schools had done so two years after implementation.  In terms of behavior issues, a school was considered successful if 80–90% of elementary students and 70–80 middle school students received less than 2 ODRs during a school year.  After the first year, 70% of schools has achieved these results.  Between the first and second years, the schools reduced ODRs by 28% collectively.&lt;ref name="Muscott" /&gt;

Positive education is, by no means, uniformly agreed on as an effective teaching strategy.  The [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (NCLB) was proposed in 2001 to improve the conditions of public schools in the United States.  The act has imposed [[standardized test]]ing on all schools that are government-run and receive government funding.  Each school's test results are analyzed, and schools with continuously low test scores are obligated to develop an improvement plan.&lt;ref name="nclb"&gt;Dillon, E., &amp; Rotherham, A. [http://www.educationsector.org/publications/states-evidence-what-it-means-make-adequate-yearly-progress-under-nclb "States' Evidence: What It Means to Make 'Adequate Yearly Progress' Under NCLB"]. Retrieved April 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is still much debate whether the act has a positive effect on America's education system, since it is based on performance-based education reform.  Supporters of the act believe that setting measurable goals will improve individual educational success and that statewide tests will improve the situation of public schools. Major teacher's [[trade union|unions]] and other opponents, however, have doubts about the act's effectiveness, which may be due to the mixed results of NCLB, arguing over the ineffectiveness of standardized tests and higher standards for teacher qualification.  Opponents also argue that standardized tests are exceedingly [[bias]]ed and that higher standards for teacher qualification simply contribute to teacher shortage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Kelly|title=Communication Arts Chairman|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(nd) {{cite web|url=http://ed.sc.gov/news/more.cfm?articleID=385|title=New study confirms vast differences in state goals for academic 'proficiency' under NCLB|publisher=South Carolina Department of Education|accessdate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the 2009 [[United States Department of Education]] program [[Race to the Top]], designed to spur reform in K-12 Education, and awarding $4.35 billion in funds, has been controversial for its emphasis on [[test (assessment)|testing]] to evaluate schools, an approach which contrasts positive schooling techniques, and data regarding its effectiveness has yet to be produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Besides the emphasis on standardized testing to evaluate school performance, tracking has been a very controversial, yet widely implemented, approach to learning in America's public schools.  Tracking is an approach which places children in classes according to expectation levels.  [[Honors course|Honors]], college-preparation, [[Advanced Placement]], and [[International Baccalaureate]] classes are examples of higher-level learning courses, while schools may simultaneously offer regular-level classes for other students. Research has shown a disparity in the enrollment of these classes based on race.&lt;ref name="tracking 1"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Conger, D., Long, M., &amp; Iatarola, P.|year=2009|title=Explaining race, poverty, and gender disparities in advanced course-taking|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|volume=28|issue=4|pages=555–576|doi=10.1002/pam.20455}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research also shows that while separation by tracking is beneficial for higher-level students, it produces no benefit for lower-level students, and is possibly even detrimental to their academic success.&lt;ref name="tracking 2"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Perrone, K., Wright, S., Kslazak, T., Crane, A., &amp; Vannatter, A.|year=2010|title=Looking back on lessons learned: Gifted adults reflect on their experiences in advanced classes|journal=Roeper Review|volume=39|issue=2|pages=127–139|doi=10.1080/02783191003587918}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many advocates for [[education reform]] discount tracking based on the argument that a rigorous, quality education should be provided universally through public schools.

== Applications ==
Recently, a positive psychology plan was implemented in the U.S. military to address the high rates of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], and other [[mental disorder]]s among soldiers.  The military asked [[psychologist]]s to devise some sort of way not simply to treat the problem but to prevent future soldiers from becoming vulnerable to these mental disorders.  Statistically, there is a [[normal distribution]] of reactions to combat in the military: the left side includes those who have trouble and end up suffering from a mental disorder, the middle, those who are resilient and return to normal functioning afterwards, and the right are those who bounce back to an even higher level of functioning and experience growth through adversity.  The goal of the plan is to have a negatively [[skewness|skewed]] distribution that shifts most soldiers to the right side of this distribution.  The model is designed to improve one's spiritual, emotional, social, and family fitness.  If the plan is successful within the military, it could possibly revolutionize current U.S. civilian [[health care]] and be a new model for the education system.  Within health care, it will emphasize prevention, rather than solely treatment; additionally, within schools, it will encourage psychological fitness similar to the plan used for the military.&lt;ref name="military"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Seligman, M., &amp; Fowler, R.|year=2011|title=Comprehensive soldier fitness and the future of psychology|journal=American Psychologist|volume=66|issue=1|pages=82–86|url=http://transformationalchange.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/52106144/Soldier%20fitness.pdf|doi=10.1037/a0021898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, "the emphasis on positive psychology interventions in education increases engagement, creates more curious students, and helps develop and overall love of learning&amp;nbsp;(Fisher, 2015)".&lt;ref name="positive"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/what-is-positive-education/#positive-education-research|title=What is Positive Education and How To Apply It? (+PDF)|date=2016-09-11|access-date=2017-12-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Positive education benefits the teacher, too. It is easier to engage with students and persist in the work they need to do master their academic material (Fisher, 2015). It creates a school culture that is caring, trusting, and it prevents problem behavior. In relation to achievement goals, expectancy beliefs, and value it is found that task goals associated positively with optimism resulted in a highly motivated student (Fadlelmula, 2010). Research has shown that motivation may be consistent and long-term if it is always paired with positive psychology interventions."&lt;ref name="positive"/&gt;

Additionally, the effects of positive learning were examined in the context of [[medical school]] and first-year [[physician]]s.  Often, medical students and young physicians get exhausted and burnt out from the stressful conditions they operate under.  Medical students at [[Karolinska Institutet]] were evaluated in their final year of school and again in their first year as a physician.  After controlling for baseline exhaustion, a positive learning climate in the clinic that the students were working in was found to have a negative [[correlation]] with exhaustion.  In this case, positive learning was found to predict the exhaustion of students and new doctors.  Although only a correlation, positive learning environments could benefit the well-being of people with various other careers and job conditions.&lt;ref name="doctor"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Dahlin, M., Fjell, J., &amp; Runeson, B.|year=2010|title=Factors at medical school and work related to exhaustion among physicians in their first postgraduate year|journal=Nord J Psychiatry|volume=64|issue=6|pages=402–8|doi=10.3109/08039481003759219|pmid=20429747|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/43353706_Factors_at_medical_school_and_work_related_to_exhaustion_among_physicians_in_their_first_postgraduate_year}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==
Positive education, the use of positive psychology in the realm of education, may have the potential to be a new model for successful education.  The field of positive schooling, although still in the early stages of development, seems to have a promising future.  Rather than the traditional concept of teachers simply communicating information to students, students in positive schooling learn through individual goals and by cooperating with other students to have an environment in which students can work towards the same goal together.  Overall, the goal of positive schooling is to turn all students into teachers who will pass down their wisdom and knowledge to others and teachers who will continue the ways of positive education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8693">The '''Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Urmia''' (''Русская духовная миссия в Урмии'', '''Orthodox Mission in Urmia''', ''Урмийская духовная миссия'') was an [[Eastern Orthodox]] mission of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] for ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] who lived in the border regions with Russia, mainly in the [[Persian Azerbaijan]] province, and who converted from the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] in 1898. Other Assyrians in northern Iraq, northeast Syria and southeast Turkey had already long been members of the considerably older [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]. Formally, the mission covers only twenty years - from 1898 to 1918, but the period prior to its establishment, lasted almost the entire second half of the 19th century.{{sfn|Садо|1996|p=73-112}}

== History ==
[[File:Присоединение сиро-халдейских несториан к православной церкви.jpg|thumb|Joining the Syro-Chaldean Nestorians to the Orthodox Church in 1898. St. Petersburg]]
There was a group from the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] that converted to Orthodoxy in 1898. In the mid 1890s, bishop [[Yonan of Urmia|Mar Yonan]] of [[Supurghan]] in the region of [[Urmia]],{{sfn|Bolshakoff|1943|p=102}} petitioned the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church that he and his flock be received into the Russian Church.{{sfn|Wilmshurst|2000|p=36, 281, 314}} Mar Yonan traveled to [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1898, where he and several of his clergy accepted Eastern Orthodoxy. They were received into the Russian Orthodox Church by confession of faith and vesting on the Feast of the [[Annunciation]] at the Holy Trinity Cathedral in Saint [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]]. The services were presided over by Metropolitan [[Palladius (Raev)]] of Saint Petersburg. Also in 1898, the [[Most Holy Synod|Holy Synod]] of the Russian Orthodox Church established the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Urmia, in order to aid [[Yonan of Urmia|Mar Yonan]]([[:ru:Иона (Маравгин)|ru]]) in the conversion and education of his flock.

Along with Bishop Yonan, Archimandrite [[Elia (Abraham)]] converted to Orthodoxy in 1898. In 1904 he was consecrated to the episcopate, as bishop of [[Tergawar]] in the region of [[Urmia]], and became vicar of Bishop Yonan.{{sfn|Wilmshurst|2000|p=36, 314-315}}

Since 1904, the mission published the magazine ''[[Urmia Orthodokseta|Orthodox Urmia]]'' in both the Assyrian-Aramaic and Russian languages.{{sfn|Yakubova|2016}}

In 1918, renewed persecution by the Muslims resulted in a mass exodus of indigenous Christians (including [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Armenian people|Armenians]] and [[Georgian people|Georgians]]) from northern Persia. Over 100,000 Christians fled northern Persia heading south to Iraq; untold [[Assyrian genocide|numbers were massacred]] along the way. The Orthodox Assyrians eventually ended up in Baghdad.

After the Russian Revolution, Bishop Elia could no longer communicate with Patriarch [[Tikhon of Moscow|Tikhon]] in Moscow, and joined the [[Russian Orthodox Church Abroad]].

Bishop Elia died in December 1928, and he was succeeded by Bishop John (Gewarigis),{{sfn|Bolshakoff|1943|p=104}} who was consecrated to the Epicopate in Belgrade in 1931 by Metropolitan [[Anthony (Khrapovitsky) of Kiev|Anthony (Khrapovitsky)]] and Archbishop [[Germogen (Maximov)]].

Bishop John resided in Baghdad where most of his flock lived. He retired due to old age in 1945, and eventually made his way to the U.S., where he lived with his son in Chicago. In the early 1950s, Bishop [[Nikon (Rklitsky)]], while visiting Chicago, "had a wonderful meeting with Bishop John of Urmia and Salma, the eldest member of our Council of Bishops, and spiritual head of the Orthodox Assyrians." Vladika Nikon noted that Bishop John spoke the same language as that spoken by Christ the Savior, and had been the translator at the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Urmia. After moving to Chicago to live in retirement, he found there were several thousand of his fellow Orthodox Assyrians, who were spiritually undernourished, living in the Chicago area. When Vladyka Nikon visited Bishop John, he found him "surrounded by Americans of Assyrian origin", to whom Bishop John was reading the Bible in their native language. The Synod of Bishops, through Archbishop [[Gregory (Borishkevitch) of Chicago|Gregory (Borishkevitch)]] of Chicago and Cleveland (later of Chicago, Detroit and Midwest America), Protopresbyter Arkadii Tsepuro, Protopresbyter George Grabbe (later Bishop Gregory of Washington &amp; Florida), and Protopresbyter [[Andrew (Rymarenko) of Rockland|Adrian Rymarenko]] (later Archbishop Andrew of Novo Diveyevo) arranged for Bishop John to live in retirement at the [[Novo-Diveevo|Novo Diveyevo Convent]] in Spring Valley, New York. He reposed at Novo Diveyevo in 1960 at the age of 105, and is buried in the cemetery located there.

'''Sewing'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sewing  |title=Sewing|publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[craft]] of fastening or attaching objects using [[stitch (textile arts)|stitches]] made with a [[sewing needle|needle]] and [[yarn|thread]]. Sewing is one of the oldest of the [[textile arts]], arising in the [[Paleolithic]] era. Before the invention of [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] yarn or [[weaving]] [[textiles|fabric]], [[archaeology|archaeologist]]s believe Stone Age people across [[Europe]] and Asia sewed [[fur]] and [[leather|skin]] [[clothing]] using [[bone]], [[antler]] or [[ivory]] needles and "thread" made of various animal body parts including [[tendon|sinew]], [[catgut]], and [[vein]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Anawalt (2007), pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt;

For thousands of years, all sewing was done by hand.  The invention of the [[sewing machine]] in the 19th century and the rise of [[computer]]ization in the 20th century led to [[mass production]] and [[export]] of sewn objects, but hand sewing is still practiced around the world. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Fine hand sewing is a characteristic of high-quality [[tailor]]ing, [[haute couture]] [[fashion]], and custom [[dressmaking]], and is pursued by both [[textile artist]]s and [[hobby]]ists as a means of creative expression.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The first known use of the word "sewing" was in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sewing?show=0&amp;t=1337966896|title=Sewing|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:A seated woman sewing a kimono.jpg|thumb|''Seated woman sewing a [[kimono]]'', [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]], early 19th century. Different cultures have developed diverse sewing techniques, from methods of cutting fabric to types of stitches.]]
Sewing has an ancient history estimated to begin during the [[Paleolithic Era]].&lt;ref name="kooler10"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kooler|first=Donna|title=Donna Kooler's Encyclopedia of Sewing: Hand &amp; Machine Sewing: 12 Projects|year=2009|publisher=Leisure Arts|isbn=9781601404565|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sewing was used to stitch together animal hides for clothing and for shelter.

D. Hammond-Tooke}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weaving of cloth from [[natural fibres]] originated in the Middle East around 4000 BC, and perhaps earlier during the [[Neolithic Age]], and the sewing of cloth accompanied this development.&lt;ref name=Sekhri&gt;{{cite book|last=Sekhri|first=Seema|title=Textbook of Fabric Science Fundamentals to Finishing|year=2011|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=9788120341838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], Europeans who could afford it employed [[seamstress]]es and [[tailor]]s. Sewing for the most part was a woman's occupation, and most sewing before the 19th century was practical. Clothing was an expensive investment for most people, and women had an important role in extending the longevity of items of clothing. Sewing was used for [[mending]]. Clothing that was faded would be turned inside-out so that it could continue to be worn, and sometimes had to be taken apart and reassembled in order to suit this purpose. Once clothing became worn or torn, it would be taken apart and the reusable cloth sewn together into new items of clothing, made into [[quilt]]s, or otherwise put to practical use. The many steps involved in making clothing from scratch (weaving, pattern making, cutting, alterations, and so forth) meant that women often bartered their expertise in a particular skill with one another.&lt;ref name="kooler10"/&gt; Decorative needlework such as [[embroidery]] was a valued skill, and young women with the time and means would practise to build their skill in this area. From the Middle Ages to the 17th century, sewing tools such as [[Sewing needle|needle]]s, [[pin]]s and [[pincushion]]s were included in the [[Dowry|trousseaus]] of many European brides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whiting|first=Gertrude|title=Old-Time Tools &amp; Toys of Needlework|year=1971 |version=reprint; originally published 1928 by Columbia University Press|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=9780486225173|pages=150–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decorative embroidery was valued in many cultures worldwide. Although most embroidery stitches in the Western repertoire are traditionally British, Irish or Western European in origin, stitches originating in different cultures are known throughout the world today. Some examples are the Cretan Open Filling stitch, Romanian Couching or Oriental Couching, and the Japanese stitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webb|first=Mary|title=Embroidery Stitches|year=2006|publisher=Struik|isbn=9781770074224|pages=155, 159, 170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stitches associated with embroidery spread by way of the trade routes that were active during the Middle Ages. The [[Silk Road]] brought Chinese embroidery techniques to Western Asia and Eastern Europe, while techniques originating in the Middle East spread to Southern and Western Europe through Morocco and Spain.&lt;ref name="leslie2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leslie|first=Catherine Amoroso|title=Needlework Through History: An Encyclopedia|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313335488|pages=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; European imperial settlements also spread embroidery and sewing techniques worldwide. However, there are instances of sewing techniques indigenous to cultures in distant locations from one another, where cross-cultural communication would have been historically unlikely. For example, a method of [[appliqué|reverse appliqué]] known to areas of South America is also known to Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="leslie2007"/&gt;

===Industrial Revolution===

[[File:Sewing with a 1894 Singer sewing machine.webm|thumb|Sewing with an 1894 [[Singer Corporation|Singer]] sewing machine.]]
The Industrial Revolution shifted the production of textiles from the household to the mills. In the early decades of the Industrial Revolution, the machinery produced whole cloth. The world's first sewing machine was patented in 1790 by Thomas Saint.&lt;ref&gt;http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/national-sewing-month-2011_50290c5a9fbfb.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1840s, other early sewing machines began to appear. [[Barthélemy Thimonnier]] introduced a simple sewing machine in 1841 to produce military uniforms for France's army; shortly afterward, a mob of [[tailor]]s broke into Thimonnier's shop and threw the machines out of  the windows, believing the machines would put them out of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Laurie M.|title=Queen of Inventions: How the Sewing Machine Changed the World|year=2003|publisher=Millbrook Press|isbn=9780761327066|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1850s, [[Isaac Singer]] developed the first sewing machines that could operate quickly and accurately and surpass the productivity of a seamstress or tailor sewing by hand.

While much clothing was still produced at home by female members of the family, more and more ready-made clothes for the middle classes were being produced with sewing machines. Textile [[sweatshop]]s full of poorly paid sewing machine operators grew into entire business districts in large cities like London and New York City. To further support the industry, [[piece work]] was done for little money by women living in slums. Needlework was one of the few occupations considered acceptable for women, but it did not pay a living wage. Women doing piece work from home often worked 14-hour days to earn enough to support themselves, sometimes by renting sewing machines that they could not afford to buy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=189–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tailors became associated with higher-end clothing during this period. In London, this status grew out of the [[dandy]] trend of the early 19th century, when new tailor shops were established around [[Savile Row]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Berg Companion to Fashion|year=2010|publisher=Berg|isbn=9781847885920|page=618|editor=Valerie Steele}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These shops acquired a reputation for sewing high-quality handmade clothing in the style of the latest British fashions, as well as more classic styles. The boutique culture of [[Carnaby Street]] was absorbed by Savile Row tailors during the late 20th century, ensuring the continued flourishing of Savile Row's businesses.

===20th century and today===
[[File:Bangladeshi women sewing clothes.jpg|thumb|[[Bangladesh]]i women sewing clothes.]]
Sewing underwent further developments during the 20th century. As sewing machines became more affordable to the working class, demand for [[Pattern (sewing)|sewing pattern]]s grew. Women had become accustomed to seeing the latest fashions in periodicals during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, increasing demand for sewing patterns yet more. American tailor and manufacturer [[Ebenezer Butterick]] met the demand with paper patterns that could be traced and used by home sewers. The patterns, sold in small packets, became wildly popular. Several pattern companies soon established themselves. Women's magazines also carried sewing patterns, and continued to do so for much of the 20th century. This practice declined during the later decades of the 20th century, when ready-made clothing became a necessity as women joined the paid workforce in larger numbers, leaving them with less time to sew, if indeed they had an interest.{{Citation needed|reason=Was the reason time, cheapness of clothing, or something else?|date=February 2017}} Today, the low price of ready-made clothing in shops means that home sewing is confined largely to hobbyists in Western countries{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}, with the exception of cottage industries in custom dressmaking and upholstery.

The spread of sewing machine technology to industrialized economies around the world meant the spread of Western-style sewing methods and clothing styles as well. In Japan, traditional clothing was sewn together with running  stitch that could be removed so that the clothing could be taken apart and the assorted pieces laundered separately. The tight-locked stitches made by home sewing machines, and the use of Western clothing patterns, led to a movement towards wearing Western-style clothing during the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Historical Consumer: Consumption and Everyday Life in Japan, 1850-2000|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230273665|pages=56–7|editor1=Janet Hunter |editor2=Penelope Francks }}&lt;/ref&gt; Western sewing and clothing styles were disseminated in sub-Saharan Africa by Christian missionaries from the 1830s onward. Indigenous cultures, such as the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] and [[Tswana people|Tswana]], were indoctrinated in the Western way of dress as a sign of conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornwell|first=Andrea|title=Readings in Gender in Africa|year=2005|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253345172|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; First Western hand sewing techniques, and later machine sewing, spread throughout the regions where the European colonists settled. However, a recent examination of new online learning methods demonstrated that technology can be adapted to share knowledge of a culture's traditional sewing methods. Using self-paced online tutorials, a [[Malaysia|Malay]] sewing class learned how to tailor and sew a traditional men's ''[[Baju Kurung]]'' garment in 3 days, whereas a traditional Malay sewing class would have taken 5 days to teach the same information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Abdul Salam Zailan Arabee  |author2=Mansur Azmi |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on e-Learning|year=2005|publisher=Academic Conferences Limited|isbn=9781905305124|pages=18–9|editor=Dan Remenyi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in industrial technology, such as the development of [[synthetic fibre]]s during the early 20th century, have brought profound changes to the [[textile industry]] as a whole. Textile industries in Western countries have declined sharply as textile companies compete for cheaper labour in other parts of the world. According to the U.S. Department of Labor "employment of sewers and tailors is expected to experience little or no change, growing 1 percent from 2010 to 2020".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bureau of Labor Statistics|first=U.S. Department of Labor|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/production/sewers-and-tailors.htm#tab-6|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=November 10, 2013|date=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singer Quantum Sewing 2010 to 2020|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BvTdedUpos}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that every lost textile job in a Western country in recent years has resulted in 1.5 jobs being created in an [[outsourcing|outsourced]] country such as China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flanagan|first=Mike|title=The Flanarant: China's textile and clothing challenge in new era|url=http://www.just-style.com/comment/chinas-textile-and-clothing-challenge-in-new-era_id116173.aspx|publisher=just-style|accessdate=December 10, 2012|date=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Textile workers who perform tasks with sewing machines, or do detailed work by hand, are still a vital component of the industry, however. Small-scale sewing is also an economic standby in many developing countries, where many people, both male and female, are self-employed sewers.

==Garment construction==
[[File:Tailor at work.jpg|thumb|A [[tailor]] fitting a [[suit (clothing)|suit]] in [[Hong Kong]].]]

===Patterns and fitting===
Garment construction is usually guided by a [[pattern (sewing)|pattern]]. A pattern can be quite simple; some patterns are nothing more than a mathematical formula that the sewer calculates based on the intended wearer's measurements. Once calculated, the sewer has the measurements needed to cut the cloth and sew the garment together. At the other end of the spectrum are [[haute couture]] fashion designs. When a couture garment is made of unusual material, or has extreme proportions, the design may challenge the sewer's engineering knowledge. Complex designs are drafted and refitted dozens of times, may take around 40 hours to develop a final pattern, and require 60 hours of cutting and sewing. It is important for a pattern to be created well because the way a completed piece fits is the reason it will either be worn or not. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhati|first1=Mithlesh|title=Basics of Pattern Making|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steele, Valerie  |author2=Patricia Mears, Clare Sauro |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Ralph Rucci: The Art of Weightlessness|year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300122787|pages=121–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most clothing today is [[mass production|mass-produced]], and conforms to standard sizing, based on body measurements that are intended to fit the greatest proportion of the population. However, while "standard" sizing is generally a useful guideline, it is little more than that, because there is no industry standard that is "both widely accepted and strictly adhered to in all markets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Calderin|first=Jay|title=Form and Fashion|year=2009|publisher=Rockport Publishers|isbn=9781592535415|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Home sewers often work from  [[pattern (sewing)|patterns]] purchased from companies such as [[Simplicity Pattern|Simplicity]], [[Ebenezer Butterick|Butterick]], [[McCall's]], [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], and many others. Such patterns are typically printed on large pieces of tissue paper; a sewer may simply cut out the required pattern pieces for use but may choose to transfer the pattern onto a thicker paper if repeated use is desired. A sewer may choose to alter a pattern to make it more accurately fit the intended wearer. Patterns may be changed to increase or reduce length; to add or remove fullness; to adjust the position of the waistline, shoulder line, or other seam, or a variety of other adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Veblen|first1=Sarah|title=The Complete Guide to Perfect Fitting|date=2012|publisher=Creative Publishing International}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volume can be added with elements such as [[pleats]], or reduced with the use of [[dart (sewing)|darts]]. Before work is started on the final garment, test garments may be made, sometimes referred to as [[muslin]]s.

===Sewing tools===
Sewers working on a simple project need only a few sewing tools, such as measuring tape, needle, thread, cloth, and sewing shears. More complex projects may only need a few more simple tools to get the job done, but there are an ever-growing variety of helpful sewing aids available.

In addition to sewing shears, rotary cutters may be used for cutting fabric, usually used with a cutting mat to protect other surfaces from being damaged. Seam rippers are used to remove mistaken stitches. Special marking pens and chalk are used to mark the fabric as a guide to construction.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitnick|first1=Sarai|title=The Colette Sewing Handbook|date=2011|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressing and ironing are an essential part of many sewing projects, and require additional tools. A steam iron is used to press seams and garments, and a variety of pressing aids such as a seam roll or tailor's ham are used to aid in shaping a garment. A pressing cloth may be used to protect the fabric from damage.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

[[Sewing machine]]s are now made for a broad range of specialised sewing purposes, such as quilting machines, heavy-duty machines for sewing thicker fabrics (such as leather), computerized machines for embroidery, and [[serger]]s for finishing raw edges of fabric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sewing |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i6-cMRM4L0/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide variety of [[presser foot]] attachments are available for many sewing machines—feet exist to help with hemming, pintucks, attaching cording, assembling patchwork, quilting, and a variety of other functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahles|first1=Carol|title=Fine Machine Sewing|date=1996|publisher=The Taunton Press|location=Newtown, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elements of garment sewing===
[[File:Palestinian Tailors with a Passion for Fashion (4185091128).jpg|alt=People at sewing machines in a small garment factory|thumb|Garment construction]]

Seamstresses are provided with the pattern, with the intent of using as little fabric as possible. Patterns will specify whether to cut on the [[grain (fabric)|grain]] or the [[bias cut|bias]] to manipulate fabric stretch. Special placement may be required for directional, striped, or plaid fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitnick|first1=Sarai|title=The Colette Sewing Handbook|date=2011|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|pages=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporting materials, such as [[interfacing]], interlining, or [[lining (sewing)|lining]], may be used in garment construction, to give the fabric a more rigid or durable shape.

Before or after the pattern pieces are cut, it is often necessary to mark the pieces to provide a guide during the sewing process. Marking methods may include using pens, pencils, or chalk, tailor's tacks, snips, pins, or thread tracing, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitnick|first1=Sarai|title=The Colette Sewing Handbook|date=2011|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the normal [[lockstitch]], construction [[stitch (textile arts)|stitches]] include edgestitching, understitching, staystitching and topstitching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baumgartel|first=Beth|title=Singer Simple Sewing|year=2009|publisher=Creative Publishing International|isbn=9781589234741|pages=57–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[seam (sewing)|Seam]] types include the plain seam, zigzag seam, [[flat fell seam]], French seam and many others.

===Clothing technology===
[[Clothing technology]] has evolved to a complicated science weighed against the labor cost making positive and negative effects across the globe. Millions of women in Bangladesh and other developing countries have come out of poverty working as Sewing Machine Operators.

===Construction of digital garments===

[[File:Colorful Seams on Digital 3D Clothing.jpg|thumbnail|right|Digital clothing created with virtual sewing machine in a cloth simulation software]]
With the development of cloth simulation software such as CLO3D, Marvelous Designer and Optitex, seamstresses can now draft patterns on the computer and visualize clothing designs by using the pattern creation tools and virtual sewing machines within these cloth simulation programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Virtual Fashion and the Creation of Digital Clothes|url=https://cgelves.com/all-about-virtual-fashion-and-how-are-digital-3d-clothes-made|accessdate=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyle'', Paul William Gleason writes, "Boyle's stories and novels take the best elements of [[Raymond Carver|Carver]]'s minimalism, [[John Barth|Barth]]'s postmodern extravaganzas, [[Gabriel Garcia Marquez|Garcia Marquez]]'s [[Magic realism|magical realism]], [[Flannery O'Connor|O'Connor]]'s dark comedy and moral seriousness, and [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]' entertaining and strange plots and brings them to bear on American life in an accessible, subversive, and inventive way".&lt;ref&gt;Gleason, Paul William. ''Understanding T.C. Boyle (Understanding Contemporary Literature''. Columbia, S.C.: University of South Carolina, 2009, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Boyle's novels and short stories explore the [[baby boom generation]], its appetites, joys, and addictions. His themes, such as the often-misguided efforts of the male hero and the slick appeal of the anti-hero, appear alongside brutal satire, humor, and [[magical realism]]. His fiction also explores the ruthlessness and the unpredictability of nature and the toll human society unwittingly takes on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.storysouth.com/nonfiction/2006/08/t_coraghessan_boyle_and_surviv.html |title=storySouth Non-Fiction |publisher=Storysouth.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; His novels include ''World's End'' (1987, winner of the Pen/Faulkner Award for Fiction); ''The Road to Wellville'' (1993);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Neill |first=Molly |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9F0CEFDE163CF931A35755C0A965958260&amp;ref=t_coraghessan_boyle |title=AT BREAKFAST WITH – T.

Boyle has published eight collections of short stories, including ''Descent of Man'' (1979), ''Greasy Lake'' (1985), ''If the River was Whiskey'' (1989), and ''Without a Hero'' (1994). His short stories regularly appear in the major American magazines, including ''The New Yorker'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/search/query?query=authorName:%22T.%20Coraghessan%20Boyle%22 |title=authorName:"T.

== Personal life ==
T.C. Boyle is married to Karen Kvashay.  They have three children and live in [[Montecito, California|Montecito]] near [[Santa Barbara, California]].&lt;ref name="NNDB"/&gt; Their home was imperiled in the 2017 [[Thomas Fire]] which consumed 440 square miles and over 1,000 structures in [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara]] and [[Ventura county|Ventura]] counties, killing a firefighter in the latter. The fires denuded drought-stricken hillsides of vegetation and torrential rains in January 2018 subsequently dislodged immense boulders and precipitated [[2018 Southern California mudflows|mudslides]] which destroyed over one hundred homes and killed almost two dozen of his neighbors. Over 10,000 people were evacuated from Montecito as a result of the sequence of natural disasters. Boyle extensively documented both calamities on his website, and additionally in an article for [[The New Yorker]] magazine.&lt;ref name=mudslides&gt;[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/after-the-mudslides-an-absence-in-montecito After the mudslides, an absence in Montecito], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', T.C. Boyle, January 22, 2018. Retrieved January 24, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyle has said [[Gabriel García Márquez]] is his favorite novelist. He is also a fan of [[Flannery O'Connor]] and [[Robert Coover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=T. C.

'''Threshold knowledge''' is a term in the study of [[higher education]] used to describe core concepts — or '''threshold concepts''' — which, once understood, transform perception of a given subject, phenomenon, or experience. &lt;ref name=MeyerLand2003&gt;Meyer J H F and Land R 2003 "Threshold Concepts and Troublesome Knowledge – Linkages to Ways of Thinking and Practising" in ''Improving Student Learning – Ten Years On''. C.Rust (Ed), OCSLD, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced by Jan Meyer and Ray Land,&lt;ref name=MeyerLand2003 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Threshold Concepts within the Disciplines'', edited by Ray Land, Jan H. F. Meyer and Jan Smith
Sense Publishers, Rotterdam, 2008 [Educational Futures: Rethinking Theory and Practice, Michael Peters (Ed.), volume 16] {{ISBN|978-90-8790-267-4}} (paperback), {{ISBN|978-90-8790-268-1}} (hardback).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MeyerLand2005&gt;Meyer JHF, Land R (2005). "Threshold concepts and troublesome knowledge (2): Epistemological considerations and a conceptual framework for teaching and learning" ''Higher Education'', '''49'''(3), 373-388.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LandCousin2005&gt;Land, R., Cousin, G., Meyer, J.H.F. and Davies, P. (2005), Threshold concepts and troublesome knowledge (3): implications for course design and evaluation, in C. Rust (ed.), Improving Student Learning − equality and diversity, Proceedings of the 12th Improving Student Learning Conference. Oxford: OCLSD.&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer and Land also discuss the related idea of '''troublesome knowledge''', ideas that appear alien or counter-intuitive.&lt;ref name=MeyerLand2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=MeyerLand2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=LandCousin2005 /&gt; the theory holds that:

"there are certain concepts, or certain learning experiences, which resemble passing through a portal, from which a new perspective opens up, allowing things formerly not perceived to come into view. This permits a new and previously inaccessible way of thinking about something. It represents a transformed way of understanding, or interpreting, or viewing something, without which the learner cannot progress, and results in a reformulation of the learners’ frame of meaning. The thresholds approach also emphasises the importance of disciplinary contexts. As a consequence of comprehending a threshold concept there may thus be a transformed internal view of subject matter, subject landscape, or even world view. Typical examples might be ‘Personhood’ in Philosophy; ‘The Testable Hypothesis’ in Biology; ‘Gravity’ in Physics; ‘Reactive Power’ in Electrical Engineering; ‘Depreciation’ in Accounting; ‘Legal Narrative’ in Law; ‘Geologic Time’ in Geology; ‘Uncertainty’ in Environmental Science; ‘Deconstruction’ in Literature; ‘Limit’ in Mathematics or ‘Object-oriented Programming’ in Computer Science." ([https://www.lamission.edu/learningcenter/docs/1177-threshold-concepts-and-transformational-learning.pdf#gen Meyer, Land &amp; Baillie, 2010, p. ix])

These ideas have been explored by several subsequent researchers in a variety of disciplinary contexts including:
* International Theory.&lt;ref name="Korosteleva2010"&gt;Korosteleva, E. A. (2010) Threshold Concept Through Enactive Learnings: How Effective Are They in the Study of European Politics?, International Studies Perspectives, 11, 37-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Threshold concepts in engineering education-exploring potential blocks in student understanding" ''International Journal of Engineering Education'', '''22'''(5), 955-962.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory has also been criticised.&lt;ref&gt;Rowbottom DP (2007). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9752.2007.00554.x/abstract "Demystifying threshold concepts." ''Journal of Philosophy of Education''], '''41'''(2), 263-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The University of Kansas Medical Center''', commonly referred to as '''KU Med''', is a medical campus for the [[University of Kansas]]. KU Med houses the university's schools of medicine, nursing, and health professions, with the primary campus in [[Kansas City, Kansas]]. Other campuses are located in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] and [[Salina, Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2011/07/25/university-of-kansas-medical-school.html |title=University of Kansas medical school opens smallest U.S. campus to boost rural care |date=July 25, 2011 |accessdate=October 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The School of Medicine was formed in 1905, with several Kansas City hospitals being combined within the next ten years. In 1947, the campus was renamed to the University of Kansas Medical Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kumc.edu/school-of-medicine/history-and-philosophy-of-medicine/kumc-archives/kumc-history/1905-1909.html|title=1905-1909|website=www.kumc.edu|accessdate=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campus began expanding its programs over the next forty years, and on February 27, 1990, the hospital performed its first liver transplant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www2.kumc.edu/publications/inthecenter/pdf/030801.pdf |title=KU Med's First Liver Patient Leads to a Full Life |accessdate=October 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the state of [[Kansas]] was struggling to keep the hospital and its medical campus open so the [[Kansas Legislature|state legislature]] passed a bill to sell the [[University of Kansas Health System|hospital]], and keep the medical campus for schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article182371426.html|title=KU Hospital was barely breathing 20 years ago. Here’s why it’s thriving now|accessdate=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the state separated with the hospital, the Medical Center has turned its focus on [[cancer]]. In 2002, the KU Cancer Center was established, with the help of the [[Grand Lodge of Kansas|Kansas masons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.news.ku.edu/2007/november/7/wolf.shtml|title=KU News - Kansas Masonic Cancer Research Institute receives $300,000 for endowed professorship|website=archive.news.ku.edu|accessdate=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a [[National Cancer Institute]]-designated in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2012/07/12/ku-cancer-center-is-expected-to.html |title=University of Kansas Cancer Center gets National Cancer Institute designation |date=July 12, 2012 |accessdate=October 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academics ==
KU Med teaches it courses in both academic buildings, as well as the hospital. KU Med consists of three schools: the [[University of Kansas School of Medicine|School of Medicine]], the School of Nursing, and the School of Health Professions. With three campuses spread out in Kansas, the Medical Center employs 4,084 people, with 1,233 of those being teaching faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kumc.edu/communications/ku-medical-center-fast-facts.html|title=KU Medical Center Fast Facts|website=www.kumc.edu |accessdate=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 1, 2018, the KU Medical Center has 3,695 students enrolled.&lt;ref name=Enrollment/&gt;

The current executive vice chancellor, and current dean of the School of Medicine, is Robert D. Simari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kumc.edu/news-listing-page/2018-simari-announcement.html|title=Robert D.
