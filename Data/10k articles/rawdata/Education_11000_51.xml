'''Anna Caroline Maxwell''' (March 14, 1851{{spaced ndash}}January 2, 1929), was a [[nurse]] who came to be known as "the American [[Florence Nightingale]]". Her pioneering activities were crucial to the growth of professional nursing in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toprntobsn.com/greatest-nurses-of-world-war-i/|title=10 Greatest Nurses of World War I - Top RN to BSN|date=2012-09-13|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Maxwell was born in [[Bristol, New York]] on March 14, 1851. Her father was a Scottish emigrant, clergyman John Eglinton Maxwell, and her mother was an American-born woman of English descent, Diantha Caroline Maxwell.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1921-01-01|title=Anna Caroline Maxwell, R.N., M.A.|jstor=3407031|journal=The American Journal of Nursing|volume=21|issue=10|pages=688–697|doi=10.2307/3407031}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to Canada for some of Maxwell's childhood, returning in 1874.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; That year, she began nursing without formal training, as an assistant matron at New England Hospital.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She left in 1876 and spent two years in England before enrolling at [[Boston City Hospital]] Training School for Nurses.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nursingworld.org/AnnaCarolineMaxwell|title=Anna Caroline Maxwell (1851-1929) 1996 Inductee|website=www.nursingworld.org|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was attracted there by the renown of [[Linda Richards]], one of America's first nurses, who taught at the school.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Career ==
In 1880 Maxwell was hired to start a training school at Montreal General Hospital, however she found it a frustratingly slow experience. She left after six months and travelled to Europe, where she visited a number of hospitals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She returned to America and in November 1881 she was offered the superintendency of the Training School for Nurses at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in Boston.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1889, she moved to New York to be director of nursing at St. Luke's Hospital, and from there became superintendent of nursing at the [[New York-Presbyterian Hospital|Presbyterian Hospital]] of New York from 1892 to 1921.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Maxwell was also the first director of the Presbyterian Hospital's nursing school, founded in 1892, which later became the [[Columbia University School of Nursing]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Wartime activities===

During the [[Spanish–American War]] Maxwell requested permission to take trained nurses to military hospitals to care for casualties. She was sent to a field hospital in [[Chickamauga, Georgia|Chicamauga]], Georgia, where she and her nurses encountered poor sanitation, widespread disease, and a high death rate. Maxwell and her nurses were able to improve the conditions significantly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There was also an outbreak of [[typhoid fever]] at a military training camp in the area, and Maxwell led 150 nurses in caring for over 600 cases, as well as cases of [[malaria]] and [[measles]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The military was impressed with the nurses' achievements and in 1901, with Maxwell's involvement, the [[United States Army Nurse Corps]] was established.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In [[World War I]], she also worked to prepare nurses for active military service, and in 1916 travelled to Europe to visit hospitals at the fronts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; France awarded her the [[Medaille de l'Hygiene Publique]] (Medal of Honor for Public Health) in recognition of her work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Following the war, Maxwell worked for nurses to be given a rank in the armed forces, which was achieved in 1920.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Other activities ===

In addition to her work in education and with the military, Maxwell co-wrote a textbook with [[Amy Elizabeth Pope|Amy E. Pope]] entitled ''Practical Nursing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/practicalnursin00popegoog|title=Practical nursing; a text-book for nurses|last=Maxwell|first=Anna Caroline|last2=Pope|first2=Amy Elizabeth|date=1914-01-01|publisher=New York, London, G. P. Putnam's sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also a member of the American Society of Superintendents of Training Schools for Nurses (1893), which later developed into the [[National League for Nursing]], and the Nurses' Associated Alumnae of the United States and Canada (1897), which later became the [[American Nurses Association]]. She was also a member of the [[International Council of Nurses]] (1899) and the [[American Red Cross Nursing Service]] (1899), and was involved in establishing the ''[[American Journal of Nursing]]'' and the [[Isabel Hampton Robb]] Scholarship Fund.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Recognition ===

The first building to open at the new [[Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center]] in 1928 was the home for the university's nursing school. It was named the "Anna C. Maxwell Hall" in her honor. The hall was razed in 1984 to make room for a new hospital building, and the university established an endowed professorship at the nursing school in Maxwell's name.  Maxwell was one of the first women buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Columbia University]] awarded her an honorary [[Master of Arts]] degree. 
Due to her military service, establishing the Army Nurse Corps, she was one of the first women buried in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/acmaxwell.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16948">'''Business education''' involves teaching students the fundamentals, theories, and processes of [[business]]. Education in this field occurs at several levels, including [[secondary education]] and [[higher education]] or [[university]] education.  Approximately 38% of students enroll in one or more business courses during their high school tenure.

==Secondary education==
{{Main|Business studies}}

Business is taught as an academic subject at [[secondary education|secondary]] level in many countries, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Ireland]], [[Lesotho]], [[Nepal]], [[New Zealand]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nigeria]], [[South Africa]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Argentina]], [[Sweden]], [[Tanzania]], [[Malaysia]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. At pre-tertiary level, it is often called '''Business Studies''', and usually combines elements of [[accountancy]], [[finance]], [[marketing]], [[organizational studies]], [[human resource management]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sh.se/p3/ext/content.nsf/aget?openagent&amp;key=about_the_subject_1298025420871|title=Business studies|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Undergraduate education==
At the [[university]] level, students have the opportunity to take [[undergraduate degree]]s, usually a [[bachelor's degree]], in business and management. Specific curricula and degree-granting procedures differ by program and by region.  In general though, the program will comprise either preparation for management and general business, or a detailed - more academic - focus on a specific area. Regardless, all will typically include basic selections such as Accounting, Marketing, Finance, and [[Operations Management]].

Management-directed programs&lt;ref&gt;See for example BBA program outlines at: [https://www.uregina.ca/admin/academic/business_school/majors.htm uregina.ca]; [http://iitrade.ac.in/courses.asp?detail=bba Institute of International Trade]&lt;/ref&gt; are designed to give a broad knowledge of the functional areas of a company, and their interconnection, and also to develop the student's practical managerial skills, communication skills and business decision-making capability. These programs thus incorporate [[training]] and practical experience, in the form of [[case study|case projects]], presentations, [[internship]]s, industrial visits, and interaction with experts from the industry.

Subject specific programs, on the other hand, focus on a particular area, and are often more weighted towards theory. Even in these cases, however, additional to their [[academic major|major]], students are exposed to general business principles, taking initial courses in accounting/finance, human resources, statistics, marketing, economics, and information systems.

Degrees offered here include:
* The [[Bachelor of Business Administration]] (BBA) degree is awarded to students who complete three to four years of full-time study in [[business administration]]. The degree often, though not always, requires a major in a specific field such as [[accountancy|accounting]], finance, [[human resource management|HRM/personnel]], marketing, [[management]], [[management information systems]], [[real estate]], [[strategic management]], or others. Similar programs include the [[Bachelor of Science in Business Administration]] (BSBA), a quantitative variant on the BBA, [[Bachelor of Science in Business]] and [[Bachelor of Administrative Studies]] degrees. The [[Bachelor of Public Administration]] (BPA) is an [[undergraduate degree]] in [[public administration]]. The [[Bachelor of Business Management]]/[[Bachelor of Management Studies]] are similar to the BBA, but with a stronger emphasis on leadership and management skills.
* The Bachelor of International Business economics (BIBE) degree is awarded to students who complete four years of full-time study in business administration. In the last 2 years students must choose a specific field (such as the ones mentioned in the BBA). This degree is taught only in English and its aim is to enable students to work abroad and be prepared to manage large, multinational firms. It is compulsory to study abroad for at least 6 months. This degree appeared with the Bologna Process in Europe and is taught in universities like the [[Pompeu Fabra University]].
* The [[Bachelor of Commerce]] (B.Com, or B.Comm; [[Bachelor of Commerce and Administration]] (BCA) is an alternate title) is, likewise, an undergraduate degree in general [[business management]], although it is more theory-based and usually incorporates an [[Bachelor of Commerce#Areas of study|academic major]]. The distinction between the B.Comm and the BBA, then, is often that the latter specifically applies theories to real-life business situations, while the former concentrates more broadly on a wide range of ideas and concepts in [[commerce]] and related subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBA and BCom: What's the difference? |url=http://www.news.utoronto.ca/bba-amd-bcom-whats-difference |publisher=University of Toronto – News@UofT |website=News.utoronto.ca |date=10 June 2008 |accessdate=8 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628141733/http://www.news.utoronto.ca/social-sciences-business-law/bba-amd-bcom-whats-the-difference.html |archivedate=28 June 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Bachelor of Business]] (B.Bus or B.Bus (Major)) degree is an undergraduate degree in general business management offered by universities in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand. Similar in nature to the Bachelor of Commerce degree, Bachelor of Business degrees are often awarded at technology-focused universities in accordance with the Dawkins review (1986) of the Australian higher education sector. At many Australian universities, a Bachelor of Business degree enables graduates to undertake greater specialty in their chosen academic major as compared to a general BBA degree.
* The [[Bachelor of Management and Organizational Studies]] degree (BMOS in Canada) is a four-year undergraduate degree in business management. However, this degree teaches knowledge-based business and is as much theoretical as it is case-based. The BMOS degree especially emphasizes social sciences such as psychology, sociology, economics, etc.
* The [[Bachelor of Business Science]] (B.Bus.Sc) degree is similar to the BCom. However, it is a four-year honors-level course with an increased focus on the major and covers [[list of management topics|management theory]] in further depth. Also, students taking this approach are able to major in various quantitative disciplines not (typically) available in the B.Comm or BBA; related to this—and similarly in distinction—''all'' B.Bus.Sc students require a full first-year [[mathematics]] course, and in addition to this, courses in statistics.
* The [[Bachelor of Accountancy]] (B.Acy or B.Acc or B. Accty) degree is a specialized degree in accountancy; it is often the principal (or only) undergraduate degree [[First professional degree#Professional degrees|recognized for later professional practice]]. It is distinct from a BBA or B.Comm with a major in accountancy in that the entire program is focused on accountancy, while other topics are supplementary. It is also known as Bachelor of Accounting, Bachelor of Accounting Science, or Bachelor of Comptrolling (B.Acc.Sci or B.Compt).
* The [[Bachelor of Economics]] (B.Ec, B.Econ.Sc; sometimes BA (Econ), B.Sc (Econ), B.S.Sc (Econ) or BBA (Econ)) degree is similarly a specialized degree in the field of economics. Courses may last anywhere from three years to six years and are typically more [[theoretical]] and [[mathematical]] than the BBA or B.Comm with a major in economics (often substantially so). Economics is not a business discipline ''per se'' but a social science, and economics degrees are therefore often offered through liberal arts colleges.
* There are various other specialized business degrees such as the [[Bachelor of Finance and Banking]]. A further example is the [[Bachelor of Arts in Organizational Management]] (BAOM) degree, which is awarded to students who complete a four-year course of study in the field. The core functions of this program are the teaching of organizational functions, communication, group behavior, decision-making, human resources management, ethics, and to develop and deploy in the students effective skills in management and leadership. Also offered are the [[Bachelor of Science in Business Education]] (BSBE), an undergraduate degree in [[the teaching of business]] and the [[Bachelor of Business Teacher Education]] (BBTE), a variant on the BSBE.

==Postgraduate education==
At the [[graduate school]] level, students seek a variety of [[master's degrees]], either in [[general management]]–very commonly the [[MBA]]–or in a specific area, such as marketing or finance.  A further distinction is that students pursuing postgraduate degrees often have some business experience, although this is not always a program requirement. 

Corresponding to both of these, graduate degrees in business and management are generally of two sorts. 
* On the one hand, programs such as the Master of Science (M.Sc) or Arts (MA) or Commerce (M.Com) in General Management (sometimes also called Master in Management, or MIM) usually do not require professional experience. (Often the M.Sc in Management is for graduates with a first academic degree in a social science, while the MA in Management is for other backgrounds. The Master of Engineering Management, MEM, is aimed at graduates with an engineering background.) 
* On the other hand, the [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) requires a minimum of two to three years of professional experience and is open for graduates from any field. 

A related distinction: the M.Sc in Management is more specialized than an MBA, and is more suited for academic research, while the MBA is more industry- and management-focused. 

As regards degree structure, postgraduate business programs are, in general, designed such that students gain exposure to theory and practice alike;&lt;ref&gt;See for example: [http://www.hbs.edu/mba/academic-experience/Pages/the-hbs-case-method.aspx "The HBS case-method", hbs.edu]; [http://www.chicagobooth.edu/about/chicago-approach "The Chicago Approach", chicagobooth.edu]; [http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/mba/learning/practical-learning/ "Practical Learning", jbs.cam.ac.uk]; [http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/mba/academic-experience "Academic Experience", gsb.stanford.edu].&lt;/ref&gt; the mix, though, will differ by degree and by school,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronaldyeaple/2012/07/09/is-the-mba-case-method-passe/ Is the MBA Case Method Passé?] [[forbes.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; as discussed. Learning is then through lectures, case studies, and often team projects (“syndicate” work). The theory is covered in the classroom setting by [[Professor|academic faculty]]. Particularly in the MBA, the theory is then reinforced, and revisited, also in the classroom setting, through the [[case method]], placing the student in the role of the decision maker, "complete with the constraints and incomplete information found in real business issues." Practical learning often comprises [[Management consulting|consulting project]]s with real clients, or at least addressing an actual case, and is often undertaken in teams. The practical elements (as well as the case studies) may involve [[Professor#Non-tenure-track positions 2|external practitioners]], and sometimes executives, supporting the teaching from academic faculty.  (See [[Business school #Use of case studies]] and [[Business_school#Other_approaches|#Other approaches]].) One of the challenges for business academics is demonstrating that their curriculum is relevant to those who want to become managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacIntosh|first=Robert|last2=Beech|first2=Nic|last3=Bartunek|first3=Jean|last4=Mason|first4=Katy|last5=Cooke|first5=Bill|last6=Denyer|first6=David|date=2017-01-01|title=Impact and Management Research: Exploring Relationships between Temporality, Dialogue, Reflexivity and Praxis|journal=British Journal of Management|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=3–13|doi=10.1111/1467-8551.12207|issn=1467-8551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctoral==
At the [[doctoral]] level, all degrees offered are research focused, although they do differ as regards their relative weightings of theory versus practice. Typically, the DBA, DPA, DHA and D.Mgt emphasize [[Management#Levels of management|managerial practice]] alongside research; relatedly, the theses for these degrees will often focus on [[applied research]]. The other doctorates here are (exclusively) theory and research based. Entrance is usually on the basis of a relevant master's degree, and for practice-weighted degrees, relevant managerial experience. For the topic areas applicable to the [[thesis]] component see: [[List of fields of doctoral studies in the United States#Business Management.2FAdministrative Services|List of fields of doctoral studies in the United States
 #Business Management/Administrative Services]]. Degrees offered here include:
*[[Doctor of Business Administration]] (DBA)
*[[Doctor of Commerce]] (D.Com)
*[[Doctor of Health Administration]] (D.H.A.)
*[[Doctor of Management]] (D.M., D.Mgt)
*[[Doctor of Public Administration]] (DPA)
*[[PhD in Management]] (Ph.D)
*[[Ph.D/M.B.A]] ([[double degree]])

A '''chancellor''' is a leader of a college or university, usually either the executive or ceremonial head of the university or of a university campus within a [[university system]].

In most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and former Commonwealth nations, the chancellor is usually a ceremonial non-resident head of the university. In such institutions, the chief executive of a university is the '''vice-chancellor''', who may carry an additional title, such as "president &amp; vice-chancellor". The chancellor may serve as chairman of the governing body; if not, this duty is often held by a chairman who may be known as a pro-chancellor.

In many countries, the administrative and educational head of the university is known as the president, [[principal (academia)|principal]] or [[rector (academia)|rector]]. In the United States, the head of a university is most commonly a university president. In U.S. university systems that have more than one affiliated university or campus, the executive head of a specific campus may have the title of chancellor and report to the overall system's president, or vice versa.

==Chancellor==

===Australia and New Zealand===
In both Australia and New Zealand, a chancellor is the chairman of a university's governing body; thus, as well as having ceremonial duties, the chancellor participates in the governance of the university (but not its active management). The chancellor is assisted by a deputy chancellor (known as the pro-chancellor in some universities). The chancellor and deputy chancellor are frequently drawn from the senior ranks of business or the judiciary (it is one of the few jobs considered compatible with judicial service). Some universities have a visitor who is senior to the chancellor. University disputes can be appealed from the governing board to the visitor (as is still the case in the UK), but nowadays, such appeals are generally prohibited by legislation, and the position has only ceremonial functions (unlike the chancellor and deputy chancellor, who frequently preside at functions such as graduations, the visitor rarely attends university functions). The vice-chancellor usually serves as the chief executive of the university.

[[Macquarie University]] in Sydney is a noteworthy anomaly as it once had the unique position of ''Emeritus Deputy Chancellor'', a post created for [[John Lincoln]] upon his retirement from his long-held post of deputy chancellor in 2000. The position was not merely an honorary title, as it also retained for Lincoln a place in the University Council until his death in 2011.

Canadian universities and British universities in Scotland have a titular chancellor similar to those in [[England and Wales]], with day-to-day operations typically handled by a 
''principal''. In Scotland, for example, the chancellor of the [[University of Edinburgh]] is [[Anne, Princess Royal]], whilst the current chancellor of the University of Aberdeen is [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla, Duchess of Rothesay]].

In Canada, the vice-chancellor usually carries the joint title of "[[university president|president]] and vice-chancellor" or "[[rector (academia)|rector]] and vice-chancellor." Scottish principals generally carry the title of "[[university principal|principal]] and vice-chancellor."

In Scotland, the title and post of [[rector (academia)|rector]] is reserved to the third ranked official of university governance. The position exists in common throughout the five ancient universities of Scotland with rectorships in existence at the universities of [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]], [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]], [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]] and [[University of Dundee|Dundee]], which is also considered to have ancient status as a result of its early connections to the University of St Andrews. The position of Lord Rector was given legal standing by virtue of the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889.

Rectors appoint a rector's assessor, effectively a deputy or stand-in, who may carry out their functions when they are absent from the university. The Rector chairs meetings of the university court, the governing body of the university, and is elected by the matriculated student body at regular intervals (usually every three years to enable every undergraduate who obtains a degree to vote at least once). An exception exists at Edinburgh, where the (Lord) Rector is elected by both students and staff.

===Finland===
In Finland, if the university has a chancellor (Finnish: ''Kansleri'', Swedish: ''Kansler''), he is the leading official in the university. The duties of the chancellor are mainly to promote sciences and to look after the best interests of the university. As the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the university (Finnish: ''rehtori'', Swedish: ''rektor'') remains the de facto administrative leader and chief executive official, the role of the chancellor is more of a social, political and even historical nature. However some administrative duties still belong to the chancellor's jurisdiction despite their often arguably ceremonial nature. Examples of these include the appointment of new [[Professor#Finland|professors]] and [[docent]]s.

The chancellor of [[University of Helsinki]] (the oldest, largest and most prestigious in Finland) has also the notable right to be present and to speak in the plenary meetings of the [[Cabinet of Finland|Council of State]] when matters regarding the university are discussed. Despite his role as the chancellor of only one university, he is often regarded as the political representative of Finland's entire university institution when he exercises his rights in the Council of State.

In the [[history of Finland]] the office of the chancellor dates all the way back to the [[Swedish Empire]], and later the [[Russian Empire]]. Historically the chancellor's duty was to function as the official representative of the monarch in the autonomous university.

The number of chancellors in Finnish universities has declined over the years, and in vast majority of Finnish universities the highest official is the rector. The remaining universities with chancellors are University of Helsinki and [[Åbo Akademi University]].

===France===
In France, chancellor (''chancelier'') is one of the titles of the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] (''recteur''), a senior civil servant of the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Ministry of Education]] serving as manager of a regional educational district (''académie''). In his capacity as chancellor, the rector awards [[academic degree]]s to the university's graduates, oversees the [[legality]] of the universities executive acts and channels funding from the ministry. The rector has no executive function in any university, but remains a member ''ex officio'' of the board of every public university in his district.

===Germany and Poland===
In Germany (der Kanzler) and Poland (kanclerz), the chancellor is the head of many universities' administration and the leader of the non-academic staff while the rector is the academic head. In Poland, the main academic bodies of the university consists of: rektor (the head of the university), prorektor (deputy rektor), dziekan (the head of the faculty), prodziekan (deputy dziekan), senat (the main council of the university). In universities with presidential constitution, the university's president holds both the functions of chancellor and rector.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]] (and before 1997, [[Governor of Hong Kong]]) acts as the chancellor of all chartered universities, which includes all [[Higher education in Hong Kong#UGC funded universities|eight public universities]] and [[Open University of Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chief executive’s HKU role should only be honorary, says panel|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/2073305/strip-hong-kong-chief-executive-university-powers|website=South China Morning Post|accessdate=15 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day-to-day operation is in the hands of either a vice-chancellor (older and established institutions) or a president (in newer institutions), depending on the institution.

===Turkey, Russia, and Ukraine===
In Turkey, Russia, and Ukraine, the chancellor is the head of the university and is called "rector." Some universities in Russia and Ukraine have figurehead "presidents."

===India===
In India, almost all universities have a chancellor as their titular head whose function is largely ceremonial. The governor of the state, appointed as the union's representative of state by the president, acts as the chancellor of the university. The de facto head of the university is the vice-chancellor. In private non-profit universities, normally the head of the foundation who has established the university is the chancellor of the university and is the head of the university. His equivalent for engineering institutes is the director, even for those engineering institutes that are university equivalents like the [[Indian Institutes of Technology]].

For private university unlike the chancellor who heads the conventional Indian 'state university', the private university is headed by a president or chairman of private organization and have other posts like vice-chancellors, deans of faculties, registrar and controller of examinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two more private universities approved for Pune|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Home/Education/News/Two-more-private-universities-approved-for-Pune/articleshow/37660328.cms|accessdate=3 July 2014|work=[[The Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In Ireland, the four universities all have a chancellor as their figurehead leader. However, day-to-day operations of the universities are under the directorship of a president (a [[provost (education)|provost]] in the case of [[Trinity College, Dublin]]). The [[National University of Ireland]]'s constituent universities do not have a chancellor each; rather, the president of each constituent university has the title of [[Pro-Vice-Chancellor]] of the NUI. In [[Dublin City University]] and the [[University of Limerick]], the chancellor is also the chairman of the university's governing authority.

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, the chancellor position is given to dignitaries such as royalty or prominent politicians by universities to represent the universities in the political arena. For example, the chancellor of [[University of Malaya]], the oldest university in Malaysia is [[Nazrin Shah of Perak|Sultan Nazrin Shah]], the [[Sultan of Perak]]. His father, [[Azlan Shah of Perak|Sultan Azlan Shah]] also served as chancellor at the same university until his death in 2014.

The chancellor of [[Universiti Putra Malaysia]] is the current [[Sultan of Selangor]], [[Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah]], while the current [[Yang di-Pertuan Besar]] of [[Negeri Sembilan]], [[Tunku Muhriz]] is the chancellor of [[Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia]].

The chancellor of [[Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia]], a university situated in the state of Johor, is the current [[Sultan of Johor]], [[Sultan Ibrahim of Johor|Sultan Ibrahim]].

Datin Seri [[Jeanne Abdullah]], the wife of the former [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], [[Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] was appointed as the new chancellor of [[Open University Malaysia]] to take over the role from the first chancellor, the late YBhg Datin Paduka Seri [[Endon Mahmood]] (Abdullah Badawi's first wife).

Recently, [[UCSI]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]] has given recognition to Tan Sri Datuk Seri Panglima Dr. Abdul Rahman Arshad as its first chancellor.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, chancellor is normally the figurehead of the university, who is normally the provincial governor where that university exists.
Day-to-day business of the university is run by the vice chancellor.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, the [[De La Salle University]] designates the head of its university as the chancellor. For the University of the Philippines, the entire system is headed by a president, while the eight constituent universities under the system is each headed by a chancellor. The chancellor designates the different vice-chancellors for different areas of concern of the university: academic affairs, finance, and community affairs, among others. Some more universities like [[University of Santo Tomas]] and other colleges, institutions have chancellors. Its chancellor is the incumbent Master of the Order of Preachers (Dominicans); meanwhile, the vice chancellor is the prior provincial of the Dominican Province of the Philippines. Their roles are largely ceremonial. The University of Santo Tomas is governed mainly by its [[Rector Magnificus of the University of Santo Tomas|rector magnificus]] in overseeing its academic, financial and other affairs. On the other hand, the [[San Beda University|San Beda]] System has the prior or the abbot of [[Our Lady of Montserrat Abbey (Manila)]] as its chancellor for its constituent units while a rector-president heads each constituent unit.

Other universities in the Philippines (such as state universities like Mindanao State University where each constituent campus is headed by chancellor) are mostly headed by their respective university presidents. Meanwhile, private (esp. Catholic) institutions are headed by a rector.

===Bangladesh===
Chancellor is a titular position in Bangladesh always held by the incumbent [[President of Bangladesh]] under the Private Universities Act 1992.&lt;ref name=act&gt;{{cite web|title=The Private University Act, 1992|url=http://www.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/workgroups/bdlaw/1992-a34.htm|publisher=Südasien-Institut|accessdate=6 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217204244/http://www.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/workgroups/bdlaw/1992-a34.htm|archivedate=17 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position in public universities is not fixed for the president under any acts or laws (since the erection of a state university in Bangladesh requires an act to be passed in itself),&lt;ref name=moe&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry of Education – Law/Act|url=http://www.moedu.gov.bd/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=510&amp;Itemid=400|publisher=Ministry of Education, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh|accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has been the custom so far to name the incumbent president of the country as chancellor of all state universities thus established. The day-to-day business of the university is run by the vice chancellor. He has a deputy called the pro-vice-chancellor.

===Nepal===
In Nepal, universities have a chancellor as ceremonial head. The de facto head of the university is the vice-chancellor. The chancellor is primarily responsible for attending the convocation programmes and accepting the resignation and appointment letter of a new vice-chancellor. Generally, the prime minister is considered the chancellor, and in his absence, the minister of education acts as the chancellor.

===United States===
{{see also|List of longest serving higher education presidents}}

In the United States, heads of colleges and universities are typically called "[[University president|president]]." A multi-campus [[university system]] may be headed by a chancellor who serves as system-wide chief, with presidents governing individual institutions:  for example, the [[City University of New York]]. There are also some university systems, such as the [[University of North Carolina|North Carolina]], [[University of Illinois system|Illinois]], [[University of Missouri System|Missouri]], [[University of Massachusetts|Massachusetts]], [[University of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]] and [[University of California|California]] university systems, in which those two titles are reversed. At [[Rutgers University|Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey]], which is a single unified university with three campuses, the chief officers of the two smaller campuses at [[Rutgers Camden|Camden]] and [[Rutgers–Newark|Newark]] are called chancellors, a renaming from "[[Provost (education)|provost]]." Rutgers University itself has a president as the chief officer.

Presidents are the functional chief executive officers of most standalone U.S. universities; however, a few universities, such as [[Syracuse University]] and the [[University of Pittsburgh]], have a chancellor as the chief executive officer. There are occasional other uses of the title ''chancellor''. [[The College of William &amp; Mary]] uses chancellor in the British sense, as a figurehead leader, but the actual executive of the school is the "president," not a "vice-chancellor." Some schools, such as [[Lubbock Christian University]], give the ceremonial title of "chancellor" to a retiring university president. [[The Catholic University of America]] is headed by a [[The Catholic University of America#University rectors and presidents|president]] (formerly "rector"), with the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington|Archbishop of Washington]] serving as chancellor, a ceremonial position but one which does require the archbishop to represent the university before the [[Holy See]]. This scenario, while not always exactly duplicated, is typical in other Catholic universities due to the Catholic hierarchy. In some schools run by Catholic religious orders, the rector of the community supersedes the president when the individual is a member of that religious order.

The title ''chancellor'' is sometimes used in [[K–12 (education)|K-12]] education in a sense similar to [[superintendent (education)|superintendent of schools]], particularly in urban school districts. The [[New York City Schools Chancellor]] is the chief executive officer of the [[New York City Department of Education]], which manages the city's public school system (the largest in the United States). The leader of the [[District of Columbia Public Schools]] system is also referred to as the chancellor.

==University president==
University president is the title of the highest-ranking officer within the [[academic administration]] of a university, within university systems that prefer that appellation over other variations such as chancellor or [[Rector (academia)|rector]]. The relative seniority varies between institutions.

===France===
In France, the president is the elected chair of the board and chief executive officer in universities. The president is always elected by the board among the professors of the university. He serves a four-year term which is renewable once.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071191&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006525339&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=cid ''Code de l'éducation'', art. L 712-2] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chancellor is a servant of the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Ministry of Education]] who supervises regional educational districts. There is no hierarchical relation between the president and the chancellor.

===United Kingdom===
In Northern Ireland, the president is the chief academic and administrative officer of the university and is usually also the vice-chancellor of the university. The private London based liberal-arts university [[Richmond, The American International University in London]] utilises the same system as in the United States but also with a ceremonial chancellor as figurehead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richmond.ac.uk/about-richmond/presidents-executive-team]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In most stand-alone universities and colleges in the United States, the chief executive officer is called the president, while the second in command is called the [[provost (education)|provost]]. In some multi-campus state university systems, the chancellor has authority over all universities in the system, and therefore ranks higher than the presidents of individual universities within the system. In other state university systems, the president has authority over multiple campuses, each of which is headed by a chancellor who is under the authority of the president.

The average salary for a college presidents in private, non-profit institutions in 2015 was $569,932, 9 percent higher than in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Kate |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-11/college-president-salaries-rise-9-and-1-million-paydays-double? |title=College Presidents Making $1 Million Rise With Tuition and Student Debt |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=2017-12-11 |accessdate=2017-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vice-chancellor==
{{redirect2|Vice Chancellor|Vice-Chancellor|the Deputy to the Federal Chancellor of Germany|Vice-Chancellor of Germany}}
A "vice-chancellor" (commonly called a "VC") of a university in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, New Zealand, Australia,Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, South Africa, other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, and [[List of higher education institutions in Hong Kong|some universities in Hong Kong]] is the chief executive of the university. In Scotland, Canada, and Ireland, the chief executive of a university is usually called [[university principal|principal]] or [[university president|president]], with ''vice-chancellor'' being an honorific associated with this title, allowing the individual to bestow degrees in absence of the chancellor.

Strictly speaking, the VC is only a deputy to the chancellor of the university, but the chancellor is usually a prominent public figure who acts as a ceremonial figurehead only (e.g., the chancellor of the [[University of Cambridge]] for 36 years was [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]]), while the vice-chancellor acts as the day-to-day chief executive. An assistant to a vice-chancellor is called a [[pro-vice-chancellor]] or deputy vice-chancellor; these were traditionally academics who were elected to take on additional responsibilities in addition to their regular teaching and research for a limited time, but are now increasingly commonly permanent appointments. In some universities (e.g. in Australian universities: [[Deakin University]], [[Macquarie University]]), there are several deputy vice-chancellors subordinate to the vice-chancellor, with ''pro-vice-chancellor'' being a position at executive level ranking below ''deputy vice-chancellor''.

There are a few exceptions within England. For example, the charter of the [[University of Manchester]] provides for the vice-chancellor to also use the title ''president'', and the first vice-chancellor, [[Alan Gilbert (Australian academic)|Alan Gilbert]] (2004–10), used ''president'' as his main title. The [[University of Warwick]] now officially uses "vice-chancellor and president" (VCP), although the holder is usually still known as the vice-chancellor in all but official documents. The chief executives of the constituent colleges of the [[University of London]], many of which are now functionally independent universities, generally use the title ''principal'', although the chief executive of [[Imperial College]] has the title [[Rector of Imperial College|''rector'']], and [[Birkbeck College]] is headed by the master.

===Australia and New Zealand===
The executive head of an Australian university is the vice-chancellor, who serves as the university equivalent of a chief executive officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Vice-Chancellors at Australia's universities | work = Universities Australia | url = http://www.universitiesaustralia.edu.au/page/about-us/committees---contacts/key-contacts/vice-chancellors/ | accessdate = 7 November 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120805235443/http://www.universitiesaustralia.edu.au/page/about-us/committees---contacts/key-contacts/vice-chancellors/ | archivedate = 5 August 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vice-chancellor is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the university and reports directly to the University Council, which the chancellor heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toncich | first = Dario | year = 2008 | title = Study and Learning in the Australian University System | publisher = Dario Toncich | isbn = 1-876665-02-5 | pages = 60–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assisting the vice-chancellor, the roles of deputy vice-chancellors and pro vice-chancellors have emerged to better manage the administrative overhead of the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McMillan  | first = David | year = 1968  | title = Australian universities: a descriptive sketch | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | page = 33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada and the United Kingdom===
[[File:William Smyth.jpg|thumb|William Smyth, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford; painting by Gilbert Jackson]]
Canadian university vice-chancellors almost always carry the title of "[[university president|president]] (or equivalent) and vice-chancellor"; likewise, in Scotland, they hold the position of "[[university principal|principal]] and vice-chancellor," as do a few Canadian universities such as Queen's and McGill. In the Scottish practice, the one individual may have two sets of official robes, reflecting a continuing division of responsibilities between the two posts. The vice-chancellor's robes, therefore, should not be worn in the presence of the chancellor but should only be worn when deputizing for the chancellor.

===India===
In India, most central and state level universities have a titular head called chancellor who is either an eminent person appointed by the Government of India (in central universities) or provincial governor (in state universities). The de facto head of a university is the vice-chancellor, the highest paid official of the university. Next in command are more than one pro-vice-chancellor in charge of academic as well as administrative and financial affairs. In deemed universities and institutes of national importance, the head of the institution is either called [[director general]] or [[director (education)|director]], the latter designation being more commonly used in academic terms in the subcontinent.

===Bangladesh===
The [[President of Bangladesh]] is the titular chancellor of all universities in Bangladesh, public or private. The vice chancellor is the executive head, and his deputy, the pro-vice chancellor holds a full-time administrative office.

===Nepal===
The [[Prime minister of Nepal]] is the titular chancellor of all universities in Nepal, public or private. The vice chancellor is the executive head, and along with Registrar holds a full-time administrative office.

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, all the government universities are administered by the vice-chancellor.

===Sudan===
In Sudan, universities are administered by the vice-chancellor .

===Kenya===
In Kenya, chancellors are titular heads of public universities, either appointed by the head of state (president) directly, or, in newly introduced legislation, at the recommendation of senate and alumni of the university. The day-to-day running of universities is the responsibility of the vice-chancellors. "Rector" and "president" are not commonly used terms in university administration.

=== Malaysia ===

In Malaysia, all the government universities are administered by the vice-chancellor.

=== Nigeria ===
In [[Nigeria]], chancellors are ceremonial heads of public universities (mostly traditional monarchs), appointed by the head of state (president), governor of a state (in the case of state-owned universities) or assumed by the owner of a private university. The day-to-day running of universities is the responsibility of the vice-chancellors. "Rector" and "president" are not commonly used terms in university administration.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, day-to-day operations of the universities are under the directorship of a president (a [[provost (education)|provost]] in the case of [[Trinity College Dublin]]). However, the president of each constituent university of the [[National University of Ireland]] also has the title of [[pro-vice-chancellor]] of the NUI.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, [[University of Santo Tomas]] the day-to-day head of the university, as mandated by his duty as the [[Prior]] Provincial of the Philippine Dominican Province, the Dominican province that has majority control over the university.

As said earlier, the vice-chancellor or the "grand vice-chancellor of the University of Santo Tomas" is only the deputy to the chancellor of the university, but the chancellor is usually a prominent public figure who is not always in the country (e.g., the chancellor of [[University of Santo Tomas]] is the current [[Master of the Order of Preachers]], the current being Very Rev. Fr. Bruno Cadoré, OP, while the rector acts as the day-to-day chief executive). The current vice chancellor of [[University of Santo Tomas|UST]] is the [[Prior]] Provincial of the Philippine Dominican Province, Very Rev. Fr. Napoleon Sipalay, OP. The current rector of the university is Rev. Fr. Herminio V. Dagohoy, OP.

In the [[University of the Philippines]], the chancellor assigns different vice-chancellors to handle different aspects of running the university. There is one for instruction, administration, and community affairs, among others.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, the rektor ([[Rector (academia)#Sweden|rector]]) is the head of a Swedish university, but the word ''vice-chancellor'' (''vicekansler'') is often used as the English translation of rektor. The ''vice-chancellor'' (''vicekansler'') is also an honorary title given to the ''[[rector (academia)#Sweden|rectores magnifici]]'' at the universities of [[University of Lund|Lund]] and [[University of Uppsala|Uppsala]].

===United States===
In the United States, a vice-chancellor is an assistant to a chancellor, who is generally the (actual, not merely ceremonial) head of one campus of a large university which has several campuses. The head of the entire university is the president (the equivalent of a Commonwealth vice-chancellor), the chancellor is in charge of one campus, and a vice-chancellor is one of the chief assistants. Some systems, such as the [[California State University]], [[Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education]], and [[University of Mississippi]] invert this ranking so that the chancellor is the head of the entire university.

At the [[University of the South]], the vice-chancellor is the administrative head of the university (as well as mayor of the town of Sewanee). The chancellor is a bishop of one of the 28 southeastern [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] [[dioceses]] that own the university and is elected by the members of the board of trustees. The chancellor neither resides at the university nor holds administrative power; the office of chancellor is a ceremonial one.

==Principal==
The principal is the chief executive and the [[provost (education)|chief academic officer]] of a university or college in certain parts of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].

A "director" is the chief executive officer of a university or other educational institution. Equivalent names in different countries are [[Vice-Chancellor|vice-chancellor]] (many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries), chancellor (United States), principal (Scotland and Canada), and [[university president]].

===United Kingdom===
{{See also|Ancient university governance in Scotland}}
In Scotland, the principal is appointed by the [[university court]] or governing body of the university and will be chairman or president of the body of academics. In the case of the [[ancient universities of Scotland]], the principal is president of the [[academic senate]]. The principal also holds the title of vice-chancellor, but their powers with regard to this position extend only to the awarding of degrees, as both the vice-chancellor and chancellor are titular posts.

===Canada===
[[Queen's University]] and [[McGill University]] in Canada have principals instead of [[university president|presidents]] as a result of their Scottish origins. In addition, the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] also has a principal.

===South Africa===
{{further|List of South African university chancellors and vice-chancellors|List of Vice-Chancellors and Chancellors of the University of Pretoria|Chancellor of the University of Cape Town|Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cape Town}}
In South Africa, the [[Higher Education Act 101 of 1997]] defines the principal as "the chief executive and accounting officer of a public higher education institution."&lt;ref name='che'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.che.ac.za/documents/d000004/ |title=Higher Education Act 101 of 1997 |accessdate=2010-07-04 |date=4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition allows for the alternative nomenclatures of vice-chancellor and a rector, and these terms are in widespread use (the term ''vice-chancellor'' is more common in English-medium universities, whilst the term ''rector'' tends to be used in [[Afrikaans|Afrikaans-medium]] universities). The exact name in a particular university will be defined by the [[Higher Education Act 101 of 1997|Institutional Statute]]. The same act defines the chancellor as the titular head of an institution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5479">'''Chartered Physicist''' ('''CPhys''') is a [[chartered (professional)|chartered status]] and a [[professional qualification]] awarded by the [[Institute of Physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/physicist.aspx|title=Job profiles: Physicist|website=National Careers Service|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is denoted by the postnominals "CPhys".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VkqCBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Titles and Forms of Address: A Guide to Correct Use|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|page=xvii|date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Achieving chartered status in any profession denotes to the wider community a high level of specialised subject knowledge and professional competence. According to the Institute of Physics, holders of the award of the Chartered Physicist (CPhys) demonstrate the "highest standards of professionalism, up-to-date expertise, quality and safety" along with "the capacity to undertake independent practice and exercise leadership" as well as "commitment to keep pace with advancing knowledge and with the increasing expectations and requirements for which any profession must take responsibility".&lt;ref name="CPhys guidelines"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/membership/char-sta/chartership/cphys/page_51812.html|title=Chartered Physicist (CPhys)|accessdate=25 May 2016|publisher=Institute of Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of Chartered Physicist was introduced in 1985 following approval from the [[Privy Council (UK)|Privy Council]]. It was originally granted  automatically with corporate membership of the Institute of Physics (IoP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NtMiBPgdF6cC&amp;pg=PA183#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=125 Years: The Physical Society &amp; The Institute of Physics|author=John L. Lewis|publisher=CRC Press|date= 1 January 1999|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reform of the membership structure in 1998 saw Chartered Physicist established as a separate qualification from 2001 that could be gained either alongside or after the status of Member or Fellow of the IoP. In order to gain the qualification, a physicist must be appropriately qualified (an accredited MSci or [[MPhys]] integrated master's degree is standard, although experience leading to an equivalent level can be counted), have had a minimum of two years of structured training and a minimum of two years responsible work experience, have demonstrated a commitment to continuing professional development, and have gained a number of competencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/about/royal_charter/file_38390.pdf| title=Charter and Bylaws|accessdate=25 May 2016|publisher=Institute of Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt; For physicists gaining the status from 2012, revalidation through proof of [[continuing professional development]] is required every three years.&lt;ref name="CPhys guidelines"/&gt; 

Chartered Physicist is considered to be equal in status to [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineer]], which the IoP also awards as a member of the [[Engineering Council UK]], and other chartered statuses in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/membership/char-sta/chartership/why/file_38066.pdf|title=Becoming Chartered by the Institute – Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=25 May 2016|publisher=Institute of Physics|quote="[Q]Which one [Chartered Physicist or Chartered Engineer] is best?

==Life==
The son of John Wase of London, he was born in [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]]. He was educated at [[Eton College]], and in 1645 was admitted scholar of [[King's College, Cambridge]]. Wase became Fellow of King's, and graduated B.A. in 1648.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|WS645C|Wase, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1649 he published a translation of Sophocles's ‘Electra,’ dedicated to [[Princess Elizabeth of England|Princess Elizabeth]], with an appendix designed to show his devotion to the Stuart house. [[John Walker (clerical historian)|John Walker]] says that Wase also delivered a feigned letter from the king to [[Benjamin Whichcote]], the Provost of King's. He was deprived of his fellowship and left England.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Wase, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Captured at sea, Wase was imprisoned at [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]], but escaped, and served in the Spanish army against the French. He was taken prisoner, but was released, and returned to England and became tutor to [[William Herbert, 6th Earl of Pembroke|William]], the eldest son of [[Philip Herbert, 5th Earl of Pembroke]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In 1655 Wase proceeded M.A. and was appointed headmaster of the royal free school in [[Dedham, Essex]]. From 1662 to 1668 he was headmaster of [[Tonbridge school]], where the register states that he was B.D., and educated at the school [[Thomas Herbert, 8th Earl of Pembroke|Thomas Herbert]], younger brother of William Herbert. In 1671 he became superior beadle at law and printer to the university of Oxford. He died on 29 August 1690,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; in [[Oxford]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

==Works==
In 1647 Nicholas Gray, the Head Master of Eton, published Wase's Greek version of [[Hugo Grotius]]'s ''Baptizatorum Puerorum Institutio'' (other editions 1650, 1665, 1668, and 1682).&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In 1649, Wase published his translation of the ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'' of [[Sophocles]]. It called upon [[Charles II of England|Prince Charles]], then living in [[Jersey]], to avenge the death of his father, Charles I. [[Oliver Cromwell]] was figured as [[Aegisthus|Egist]], killed by Charles as [[Orestes]]. Wase appended two poems anticipating the immediate restoration of the monarchy, one of which mentions [[John Milton]] and alludes to his [[Milton's divorce tracts|divorce tracts]]. His Latin notebooks, many of which contain political poems written during the 1650s, are in the [[Bodleian library]]. 

In 1654 Wase dedicated to his pupil William Herbert a translation of the ''[[Cynegeticon (Grattius)|Cynegeticon]]'' of [[Faliscus Gratius]]. [[Edmund Waller]] addressed a copy of verses to Wase on this performance.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In 1668, Wase published the first complete English-language edition of [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]]'s ''Fables''. In 1678, he produced a survey of [[free education|free schools]] throughout all of England; in many cases, his survey is the only surviving record of those schools' existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.ed.uiuc.edu/westbury/paradigm/becher.html Phaedrus, a new found yet ancient author: The rise and fall of Phaedrus as a standard school author, 1668-1828], by Anne Becher, ''Paradigm: Journal of the Textbook Colloquium'', No. 23 (July, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Considerations concerning Free Schools in England'' (Oxford, 1678) urged an increase in the number of schools, and the claims of scholars on the wealthy.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; 

Besides the works mentioned, Wase also published:

* ''In Mirabilem Caroli II … restitutionem carmen gratulatorium'', London, 1660.
* ''Methodi practicæ specimen; an Essay of a Practical Grammar'', 1660; 8th edit. amended, 1682.
* ''English-Latin and Latin-English Dictionary'','' 1661.
* Latin Version of [[Sir John Spelman]]'s ''Life of Alfred'', 1678.
* Translation of Cicero's ''Tusculans'', 1683.
* ''Animadversiones Nonianæ'', Oxford, 1685.
* 'C. Wasii Senarius, sive de Legibus et Licentia veterum Poetarum'', Oxford, 1687.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

[[Thomas Hearne (antiquarian)|Thomas Hearne]], in his preface to [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]]'s ''Itinerary'', refers to Wase as an "eminent philologer". His manuscripts were preserved in the library of [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]]. A small oval portrait is mentioned by [[James Granger]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

&lt;!-- His daughter Hester married William -later Sir William- Mainwaring of Fever Cheshire.

Mainwaring's letters to her survived and at least one published in the Biographical Mirror of 1795.

He was killed during the siege of Chester.

N.b. I am trying to locate the whereabouts of the letters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9354">'''Continuing legal education''' ('''CLE'''), also known as '''mandatory''' or '''minimum continuing legal education''' ('''MCLE''') or, in some jurisdictions outside the [[United States]], as '''[[continuing professional development]]''', consists of professional education for [[Attorney at law|attorneys]] that takes place after their initial [[Admission to practice law|admission to the bar]].  Within the [[United States]], [[Attorneys in the United States|U.S. attorneys]] in many [[U.S. state|states]] and [[Territories of the United States|territories]] must complete certain required CLE in order to maintain their [[Admission to the bar in the United States|U.S. licenses to practice law]].  Outside the United States, lawyers in various jurisdictions, such as [[British Columbia]] in [[Canada]], must also complete certain required CLE.  However, some jurisdictions, such as the [[District of Columbia]] and [[Israel]], recommend, but do not require, that attorneys complete CLE.

==United States==
{{Legal education in the United States}}
No nationwide rules exist within the [[United States]] for CLE requirements or accreditation. Instead, each individual jurisdiction (i.e., each [[U.S. state|state]], the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], and each [[Territories of the United States|territory]]) exercises discretion on how to regulate [[Attorneys in the United States|U.S. attorneys]], which includes establishing rules for CLE requirements and accreditation.  This authority is typically vested in each jurisdiction's [[state supreme court|supreme court]] and delegated to special CLE commissions or boards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americanbar.org/cle/mandatory_cle.html ABA Mandatory CLE Information].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, various efforts have been made to promote uniformity of CLE programs across U.S. jurisdictions. For example, the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) promulgated a model CLE rule for individual jurisdictions to adopt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/2011_build/cle/mcle/aba_model_rule_cle.authcheckdam.pdf ABA Model Rule for Continuing Legal Education].&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Continuing Legal Education Regulators Association]] (CLEreg) created a uniform CLE application, a uniform CLE attendance certification, and a CLE distance learning glossary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clereg.org/forms CLEreg Standardized CLE Forms].&lt;/ref&gt;  CLEreg also created a CLE guide to assist its members in managing CLE programs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clereg.org/mcle-guide CLEreg CLE Guide].&lt;/ref&gt;

In U.S. jurisdictions with mandatory CLE requirements, attorneys must typically earn a minimum number of CLE credits (measured in hours) over a set period of years. Also, some of these jurisdictions require a minimum number of CLE credits for specific topics (e.g., [[ethics]], [[diversity training]], elimination of bias, [[professional responsibility]], basic skills, [[substance abuse]], prevention of [[Legal malpractice|malpractice]], and attorney-client disputes).

U.S. attorneys typically earn CLE credits by completing legal training presented by experienced attorneys. The training may cover both [[legal theory]] and practical experiences in legal practice. Competency testing is not usually required in order for attorneys to earn CLE credits through legal training. Classroom training materials can be extensive and may represent the most current and advanced thinking available on a particular legal subject. Oftentimes, a portion of CLE credits may be earned through reading and other self-study. In recent years, many jurisdictions now allow attorneys to earn CLE credits as part of [[distance education]] courses taken [[on-line]] or by listening to audio downloads.

Alternatively, experienced attorneys in some jurisdictions, such as [[New York (state)|New York]], may also earn CLE credits for speaking or teaching at accredited CLE programs; for moderating or participating in panel presentations at accredited CLE activities; for teaching law courses at [[American Bar Association|ABA]]-accredited law schools; for preparing students for and judging law competitions, mock trials and moot court arguments, including those at the high school or college level; for published legal research-based writing; and for providing pro bono legal services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/attorneys/cle/attorney_faqs.shtml#s2_q5 New York State's Continuing Legal Education: FAQs for Experienced Attorneys].&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal training or other activities often meet the rules for CLE requirements and accreditation in multiple jurisdictions. In these instances, nothing prohibits attorneys licensed in one or more of these jurisdictions from counting the training or other activities towards fulfillment of their CLE credit requirements for each of these jurisdictions.

Opportunities for CLE are offered throughout the year by [[state bar association]]s, national legal organizations such as the [[American Bar Association]], [[Federal Bar Association]], [[law school]]s, and many other legal associations and groups such as non-profit CLE providers [[Practising Law Institute]] (PLI), [[American Law Institute]] Continuing Legal Education (ALI CLE; formerly American Law Institute-American Bar Association ALI-ABA), [[The Center for American and International Law]] (CAIL), and [[The Institute of American &amp; Talmudic Law]] (IAT Law), as well as other private, for-profit enterprises. Activities are usually open to all lawyers (and sometimes non-lawyers), but organizations often offer discounts to their own members. A recent trend is toward the provision and promotion of free CLE programs.

Uniquely, [[Kentucky Bar Association|Kentucky]] allows all licensed attorneys in the state to complete their annual CLE requirement without a registration fee through a two-day program known as Kentucky Law Update, offered annually in at least seven locations throughout the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kybar.org/186 |title=Kentucky Law Update |publisher=Kentucky Bar Association |accessdate=February 19, 2013}} Click on the "About KLU" link in the menu on the left side of the page.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some attorneys, particularly those who have spent many years in active practice, have resisted CLE requirements as [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]].  However, in 1999, the [[Supreme Court of California]] upheld that state's CLE program against an [[Equal Protection Clause]] constitutional challenge.&lt;ref&gt;''Warden v. State Bar'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/21C4t628.htm 21 Cal. 4th 628] (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canada ==
In [[Canadian law|Canada]], rules vary by jurisdiction (i.e., [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]]). For example, [[Alberta]] has a mandatory [[Continuing Professional Development#CPD for lawyers|Continuing Professional Development]] (CPD) program, requiring preparation of annual CPD plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpdalberta.ca/ | title=CPD Alberta |accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lawyers develop their plans and declare to the Law Society of Alberta on an annual basis that these are complete.  The [[Legal Education Society of Alberta]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lesa.org/&lt;/ref&gt; provides tools to facilitate compliance with these requirements.

In [[Ontario]] the [[Law Society of Upper Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lsuc.on.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; beginning in 2010, instituted mandatory CPD hours for all lawyers in the province.

In [[British Columbia]], CPD is mandatory &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/page.cfm?cid=706&amp;t=continuing-professional-development&lt;/ref&gt; and lawyers are required to annually report their continuing legal education activities to the [[Law Society of British Columbia]]. The [[Continuing Legal Education Society of BC]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cle.bc.ca&lt;/ref&gt; provides tools to facilitate compliance with these requirements. Practicing lawyers must complete a minimum of 12 hours of coursework and 50 hours of self study annually.

== The Philippines ==
{{main|Continuing legal education in the Philippines}}
Continuing legal education required of members of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) to ensure that throughout their career, they keep abreast with law and jurisprudence, maintain the ethics of the profession and enhance the standards of the practice of law (Rule 1, Bar Matter No. 850&amp;nbsp;– Supreme Court of the Philippines)

'''''Dhondo Keshav Karve''''' was born at Sheravali; his ancestral home. But he spent most of his childhood at place called [[Murud, Ratnagiri|Murud]], in the district of [[Dapoli]]. He completed his primary education at a government school in [[Murud, Ratnagiri|Murud.]] Since childhood, Anna was very brilliant, intelligent and obedient. Apart from good upbringing, daily recitations of religious texts like Ramavijay, Harivijay &amp; Shivalilamrut, made his pronunciations clear and his language pure. It was on his guru’s advice that Karve used to read newspapers in Durga temple near the school, from 5 pm till sunset because it was during this time that the devotees flooded the temple, which served the intention of making maximum people aware of public issues. When he started earning, Anna took the lead and repaired the decaying baton of the same temple. His inspiring life as a responsible citizen truly started from this place. He loved [[Murud, Ratnagiri|Murud]] with all his heart and hence he did a lot of work for this place through ‘Murud development fund’.&lt;ref name="talukadapoli.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.talukadapoli.com/en/personalities/maharshi-dhondo-keshav-karve/|title=Maharshi Dhondo Keshav Karve {{!}} Taluka Dapoli|website=www.talukadapoli.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maharshi Karve, was a social reformer in [[India]] in the field of [[women's rights|women's welfare]].He established first women's university in Mumbai(Bombay).  In honour of Karve, Queen's Road in Mumbai (Bombay) was renamed to Maharshi Karve Road.

Karve continued the pioneering work in promoting [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-current-affairs/story/maharshi-kavre-318508-2016-04-18 widows' education]. The [[Government of India]] awarded him with the highest civilian award, the [[Bharat Ratna]], in 1958, the year of his 100th birthday.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://talukadapoli.com/personalities/maharshi-karve/dapoliche-karve/|title=महर्षी कर्वे मराठी प्राथमिक शाळा – मुरुड|website=talukadapoli.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appellation [[Maharshi]], which the Indian public often assigned to Karve, means ”a great sage”. He was also sometimes affectionately called "Annā Karve"; in the [[Marathi language|Marathi]]-speaking community to which Karve belonged, the appellation "Annā" is often used to address either one's father or an elder brother. He was also the first living Indian to feature on stamp postage in India.

==Personal life==
It was Murud where he spent pleasant time with his first wife, Radhabai. [[R.D.Karve|R.D Karve]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.talukadapoli.com/en/personalities/raghunath-dhondo-keshav-karve/|title=Raghunath Dhondo Keshav Karve {{!}} Taluka Dapoli|website=www.talukadapoli.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(Anna Karve’s elder son) too was born in [[Murud, Ratnagiri|Murud]]. After the death of Radhabai, he remarried a widow. This spread far and wide throughout [[Murud, Ratnagiri|Murud]] and Maharashtra. The then narrow minded society of Murud did not accept Anna’s decision. It was truly unfortunate. He took it as a challenge and eventually Pune became the place where he did most of his social work for woman’s education &amp; empowerment.

==Career as a college professor==
During 1891–1914, Karve taught mathematics at [[Fergusson College]] in [[Pune]], [[Maharashtra]].&lt;ref name="FergussonCollegeMathematics"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, the Government of India issued a stamp commemorating the birth centenary of Dhondo Keshav Karve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iic.ac.in/projects/nic/Contrivers/1958.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217142242/http://iic.ac.in/projects/nic/Contrivers/1958.html |archivedate=17 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autobiographical works==
Karve wrote two autobiographical works: Ātmawrutta (1928) in Marathi, and Looking Back (1936) in English.

==Depictions in popular culture==
The Marathi play Himalayachi Saavli (The Shadow of the Himalayas) by [[Vasant Kanetkar]], published in 1972, is loosely based on the life of Karve. The character of Nanasaheb Bhanu is a composite character based on Karve and other Marathi social reformers of the late 19th and early 20th century. The play itself depicts the tension between Bhanu/Karve's public life as a social reformer and his family life due to the social backlash and economic hardships his children and wife had to endure.

The film DhyasParva by [[Amol Palekar]], based on the life of Karve's son Raghunath, also depicts the Karve family, and their social reformation projects.&lt;ref name="Dhyasparva"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3644">An '''edited volume''' or '''edited collection''' is a collection of [[scholarly]] or [[scientific]] chapters written by different authors. The chapters in an edited volume are original works (not republished works). 

Alternative terms for edited volume are ''contributed volume'', ''edited collection'' and ''multiauthor volume''. All these terms emphasize that the book is a collection of chapters contributed by different authors and harmonized by an editor. Edited volumes are of interest in [[academic publishing]] because they present different viewpoints and experiences on a common theme. 

An edited volume is unlike an [[anthology]], which is a collection of republished short literary works by different authors. It is also not a [[collected edition]], which brings together already-published works by a single author and is edited by a [[publisher]]. It is different from a [[Basal reader|reader]], which contains collected texts for learning purposes. Finally, it is different from [[proceedings]], which contain articles written by different authors who present them at a scientific conference.

== Role of the editor==
The [[editor]] (or editors, often there are several) of an edited volume is the key figure in conceiving and producing the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information for volume editors|url=http://www.oup.com/us/corporate/authorresources/VolumeEditors.pdf|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He or she is responsible for determining the book's purpose, structure and style (as laid out in a book proposal); for signing a book contract with an interested publisher; and for selecting the individual contributors who will write the chapters (and possibly the [[foreword]]). Selecting the contributions may involve an open call for papers or may be conducted privately. The editor is also responsible for keeping the writing process on schedule and serves as the liaison between the publisher and the contributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for editors of contributed volumes|url=http://press.georgetown.edu/languages/our-authors/guidelines/guidelines-editors-contributed-volumes|publisher=Georgetown University Press|accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the task of "chasing contributions" can be substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Editing an Essay Collection|url=https://www.palgrave.com/gp/editing-an-essay-collection/7487710|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The editor may also be a contributor to the volume, by writing some chapters (often with other authors) and especially by preparing a [[preface]], an introduction or an [[afterword]] summarizing the main points. The editor also carries out the linguistic and substantive editing of the chapters before submitting the book manuscript to the publisher, and coordinates authors' review and correction of the proofs (preprints).

==Contributors' responsibilities==
Authors of individual chapters (contributors) sign ''contributor agreements'' that outline the topic and length of the chapter they are to write, the deadline for delivery, the copyright policy and the compensation (e.g. copies of the printed book). By accepting to contribute to the volume, they agree to prepare their chapters according to the book's style regarding, for example, the use of headings, illustrations, formatting and other text features.

Educate Together has its roots in the Dalkey School Project founded in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="dalkey1970s"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/lack-of-cross-cultural-education-depressing-says-president-1.2656553 | publisher = Irish Times |date = 21 May 2016 | title = Lack of cross-cultural education 'depressing', says President }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before multi-denominational education, some of those involved in education in Ireland, such as [[Aine Hyland]], Michael Johnston and Florrie Armstrong, questioned the denominational nature of the system and the need to have students of different faiths in different schools.&lt;ref name="it-florrie-armstrong-obituary"/&gt;
This group of educationalists and parents established the organisation with the stated aim:
{{quote|
''“To develop and support in Ireland the establishment of schools which are multi-denominational (i.e. with equal right of access for the children of Catholic, Protestant and other parents, and with the cultural and social background of each child held in equal respect), co-educational and managed under a system which is predominantly democratic in character, wherever and whenever there is viable local support for such a school.”''
}}

The organisers of the school met opposition from a conservative Catholic group that circulated a leaflet in the [[Dalkey]] area alleging that the new school was "atheistic", "divisive", "hostile to religion" and "a precedent for major trouble in other areas".&lt;ref name="denis-o-sullivan-p200"/&gt;

As of 2016, the majority of primary schools in the [[Republic of Ireland]] are owned by religious communities (or boards of governors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/education/the-irish-education-system/overview-of-the-irish-education-system |title=Overview of the Irish education system |publisher=Citizensinformation.ie | accessdate = 9 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 3,200 primary schools in Ireland, only 2% are multidenominational.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The [[Dalkey School Project]] was founded in 1975.&lt;ref name="denis-o-sullivan-p200"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3s3irHBdXSwC&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;dq=%22Educate%20Together%22%20Ireland&amp;pg=PA200#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false
|title=Cultural politics and Irish education since the 1950s |author=Denis O'Sullivan |page=200 |publisher=[[Institute of Public Administration (Ireland)|Institute of Public Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school opened at the start of the 1978–79 school year in temporary premises with Florrie Armstrong as the school principal.&lt;ref name="it-florrie-armstrong-obituary"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/obituaries/2010/0109/1224261975401.html |title=Pioneer of Irish multi-denominational education |publisher=[[The Irish Times]] |date=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1984 two other multi-denominational schools had been started and Educate Together was established as a co-ordinating umbrella body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.educatetogether.ie/about/history/ | title = A brief history of the organisation| publisher = Educate Together | accessdate = 9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation became a company limited by guarantee in 1998,&lt;ref name="ninenew"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/nine-new-educate-together-schools-to-open-this-year-1.2768066 | publisher = Irish Times | title = Nine new Educate Together schools to open this year | date = 25 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the year 2000, all new Educate Together schools operate with the patronage of the national company.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Educate Together has charitable status in Ireland.&lt;ref name="ninenew"/&gt;

In 2016, Educate Together was awarded [[Secularist of the Year]] by the UK's [[National Secular Society]], for putting "secularist principles into action and [demonstrating] what a 21st century secular education system should look like – children and young people educated together, taught an ethical education curriculum in a school with an inclusive ethos without any imposition of religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Educate Together awarded ‘Secularist of the Year’ prize|url=http://www.secularism.org.uk/news/2016/03/educate-together-awarded-secularist-of-the-year-prize|website=National Secular Society|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth===
The number of schools run by the organisation has grown: in 2007 it was 40, in 2008 it was 44 and by 2018 this number had risen to over 100 including its second level schools and its schools in the UK. In terms of pupil numbers, 2018 was the first year in which there were over 25,000 students attending an Educate Together school.{{fact|date=September 2018}} By 2009 Educate Together had become the fastest-growing patron of schools in the [[Republic of Ireland]].&lt;ref name="it-regulation-of-school-patronage-urged"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/1204/1224260043014.html |title=Regulation of school patronage urged |publisher=[[The Irish Times]] |date=4 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, three new schools opened in Tuam, Co. Galway, Pelletstown, Dublin and New Ross, County Wexford and one in Kildare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url = https://www.educatetogether.ie/media/national-news/new-2015-schools|title = Educate Together Opens Four Schools in Dublin, Galway, Kildare and Wexford|date = 1 September 2015 |accessdate = 9 December 2016 |website = |publisher = Educate Together |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethos==
Educate Together schools seek to "guarantee equality of access and esteem" to children irrespective of their social, cultural or religious background.&lt;ref name="whatis"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.educatetogether.ie/about/what-is-educate-together | publisher = Educate Together | title = What is Educate Together? | accessdate = 8 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Educate Together schools seek to be "learner centred" in their approach to education, and are intended to be run as "participatory democracies, with respectful partnership between parents, pupils and teachers".&lt;ref name="whatis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.educatetogether.ie/about/parents | publisher = Educate Together | title = For Parents |accessdate = 9 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum==
Educate Together schools teach the Irish Primary School Curriculum, which includes 30 minutes a day (2 hours 30 minutes per week) to be spent on faith formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.into.ie/ROI/InformationforMedia/InformationforJournalists/TimeSpentonEachSubject.pdf| publisher = INTO | title = How much time is spent teaching subjects in primary schools? (1999 Primary School Curriculum)| accessdate = 9 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/major-changes-to-primary-school-day-proposed-1.2885659 | title = Major changes to primary school day proposed | publisher = Irish Times | date = 29 November 2016 | quote = "''At present most primary schools typically spend up to 2½ hours teaching religion – or faith formation – each week''" }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an Educate Together school this time is spent teaching their Learn Together Ethical Education Curriculum rather than the religious instructions programmes taught in denominational schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.educatetogether.ie/about/learn-together | publisher = Educate Together | title = What is Educate Together? - Ethical Education | accessdate = 9 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four strands to this programme. 
*'''Moral and Spiritual''': children learn about feelings and values, the development of conscience, choices and consequences, stillness and meditation. 
*'''Equality and Justice''': children learn about wants and needs, rights and responsibilities; the promotion of equality and the nature of democracy locally (student councils are encouraged), nationally and globally.
*'''Belief Systems''': children learn about the rites and ceremonies, celebrations, key figure and beliefs and values of the six main world religions: Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism and Sikhism. Schools also address Atheism, Agnosticism and Humanism.
*'''Ethics and the Environment''': children learn about appreciation and stewardship of the natural world. Educate Together schools have an ethos of respect, diversity &amp; inclusion.

==Primary schools==
As of 2018, there are 84 Educate Together primary schools in Ireland,&lt;ref name="dalkey1970s"/&gt; in 18 different counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.educatetogether.ie/our-schools/primary| publisher = Educate Together | title = Our Network - Primary | accessdate = 9 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the body is patron to four schools in the UK.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

==Second level schools==
As of 2018, there are 13 second-level schools operating with Educate Together involved as either patron, co-patron or partner.&lt;ref name="educatetogether.ie"/&gt; These second-level schools aim not to 'teach to the test' but to instead develop their students' skills in creative and critical thinking, communication, teamwork, research and leadership.&lt;ref name="educatetogether.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.educatetogether.ie/our-schools/second-level | publisher = Educate Together | title = Our Network - Second-level schools | accessdate = 9 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published by [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] in 2008 showed that 90 per cent of parents who sent their children to an Educate Together school would send their children to a secondary school based on the same model if it was available.

Educate Together’s first second-level school - Hansfield Educate Together Secondary School - welcomed its first group of first-year students in August 2014. Educate Together is also joint patron of Kishoge Community School in Lucan and Ballymakenny College in Drogheda. It opened Celbridge Community School in August 2015 with Kildare and Wicklow Educational Training Board.

==Colleges of education==
In the Irish system, student teachers complete their initial teacher education in state-funded, religiously-run Colleges of Education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0822/811138-nursing-teacher-training/ | publisher = RTÉ | date = 24 August 2016 | title = Religion, nursing and teacher training - what's the connection? }}&lt;/ref&gt; where time is set aside for Religious Education and the study of either the Catholic or Church of Ireland religious instruction programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/merger-of-catholic-and-protestant-colleges-of-education-may-be-finalised-by-2016-1.1789561 | publisher = Irish Times | date = 9 May 2014 | title = Merger of Catholic and Protestant Colleges of Education may be finalised by 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gotocollege.ie/colleges_of_education/college_choices_colleges_of_education.html | publisher = Gotocollege.ie | title = College Choices: Colleges of Education | accessdate = 9 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At present,{{when|date=December 2016}} Educate Together is working in four of the five state-funded Colleges of Education. Educate Together is currently{{when|date=December 2016}} lobbying for sustained access to full-year groupings at least twice in the undergraduate and post-graduate cycle.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Educate Together offers a one year, part-time postgraduate Certificate in Ethical and Multi-denominational Education in partnership with St Patrick’s College of Education, Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.educatetogether.ie/colleges-of-education | publisher = Educate Together | title = Colleges of Education | date = 9 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Education in Wales''' differs in certain respects from education elsewhere in the [[United Kingdom]]. For example, a significant minority of students all over [[Wales]] are educated either wholly or largely through the medium of [[Welsh language|Welsh]]: in 2014/15, 15.7% of children and young people received Welsh-medium education - a drop from the 15.9% in 2010/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cymrufyw/36974022|title=Comisiynydd: Nifer y plant mewn addysg Gymraeg yn 'sioc'|last=|first=|date=4 August 2016|website=BBC Cymru Fyw|publisher=BBC|language=Welsh|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; And additional  10% attend schools which had a significant portion of the curriculum is bilingual. The study of the Welsh language is available to all age groups through nurseries, schools, colleges and universities and in adult education. The study of the language is compulsory for all pupils in State Schools until the age of 16.

Since [[devolution]], education policy in the four constituent countries of the UK has diverged: for example, [[Education in England|England]] has pursued reforms based on diversity of school types and parental choice; Wales (and [[Education in Scotland|Scotland]]) remain more committed to the concept of the community-based [[comprehensive school]]. Systems of governance and regulation - the arrangements for planning, funding, quality-assuring and regulating learning, and for its local administration - are becoming increasingly differentiated across the four [[home countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ces.ed.ac.uk/PDF%20Files/Brief034.pdf|title=Raffe, D. and Byrne, D. (2005) Policy Learning From ‘Home International’ Comparisons. Centre for Educational Sociology briefing.|author=|date=|website=ed.ac.uk|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education researcher David Reynolds claims that policy in Wales is driven by a "producerist" [[paradigm]] emphasising collaboration between educational partners. He also alludes to lower funding in Welsh schools compared to England, echoing similar concerns at university level. He concludes that performance data does not suggest that Wales has improved more rapidly than England, although there are considerable difficulties in making these kinds of assessments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ818610&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ818610 Reynolds, D.

==The structure of the Welsh educational system==

===Compulsory schooling===
A child's age on 1 September determines the point of entry into the relevant stage of education.  Education is compulsory beginning with the term following the child's fifth birthday, but may take place at either [[Home education in the United Kingdom|home]] or school.  Most parents choosing to educate through school-based provision, however, enrol their children in the reception year in September of that school year, with most children thus beginning school at age four or four and a half.  This age was traditionally  much earlier than in most other Western nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7234578.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Education - Is five too soon to start school?|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in recent years many European countries have lowered their age of compulsory education, usually by making one or more years of [[kindergarten]] compulsory.&lt;ref&gt;https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/eurydice/images/2/24/Compulsory_Education_in_Europe_2016_2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Primary education====

{{Main|Primary education in Wales}}
In 2014/15, there were 1,330 primary schools in Wales with 273,400 pupils and 12,240 full-time equivalent (FTE) teachers. The teacher/pupil ratio was 1:22 and the average class size was 26 pupils.&lt;ref name="Key Education Statistics 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.wales/docs/statistics/2016/160427-key-education-statistics-2016-en.pdf|title=Key Education Statistics Wales 2016|last=|first=|date=27 April 2016|website=|publisher=Welsh Government|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, there were 13 nursery schools in with 1,076 pupils and 43 full-time equivalent teachers.&lt;ref name="Key Education Statistics 2009" /&gt; In 2015/16, there were 276,950 pupils in 1,310 primary schools - a rise of 3,550 since 2014/15.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.estyn.gov.wales/sites/default/files/documents/ESTYN_Annual%20Report%202015_2016_English.pdf|title=The Annual Report of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Education and Training in Wales 2015-2016|last=|first=|date=2016|website=estyn.gov.wales|publisher=ESTYN|access-date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 a unique new curriculum - the Foundation phase - was rolled out to all schools in Wales. It began for 3- to 4-year-olds and by 2011 is in place for 3- to 7-year-olds. It is based on experiential learning, in small groups, with a teacher ratio of 1:8 for the youngest ages.

In 2014/15, there were 435 Welsh-medium primary schools with 65,460 pupils, rising from 64,366 in 2013/14 but the number of Welsh-medium primary schools decreasing from 444&lt;ref name="Key Education Statistics 2009" /&gt; due primarily to the closure of small rural schools.

====Secondary education====
{{Main|Secondary education in Wales}}
Pupils in [[secondary school]] take part in the compulsory [[GCSE]] and the non-compulsory [[A-level]] or [[Business and Technology Education Council|BTEC]] qualifications at age 16 and 18 respectively. Since 2007 the [[Welsh Baccalaureate Qualification]] has also been available as an option although it was ungraded until 2014.

In 2014/15 there were 207 secondary schools (a drop of six since 2013/14) in Wales with 182,408 pupils and 11,269 FTE teachers (a drop of 310 since 2013/14). The pupil/teacher ratio was 17:1, which has remained largely the same since 2000/01.&lt;ref name="Key Education Statistics 2009" /&gt; In 2015/16, there were 178,650 pupils in 205 secondary schools - a drop of 3,700 since 2014/15.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The same report found that in 2015/16, there were 8,000 pupils in 34 independent schools, 4,540 pupils in 32 independent special schools, and 730 pupils in 25 pupil referral units.

In 2014/15, there were 50 Welsh-medium secondary (a drop of 2 since 2013/14) schools with 36,485 pupils, dropping from 37,400 in 2013/14. In the same year, there were 4 Welsh-medium middle schools (a rise of 2 since 2013/14) with 2,448 pupils, a rise from 1,577 in 2013/14.&lt;ref name="Key Education Statistics 2009" /&gt;

In 2016, 60/3% of Year 11 pupils (aged 16) achieved the Level 2 inclusive threshold (Level 2 including a grade A*-C in English or Welsh first language and Mathematics). 35.6% of pupils eligible for FSM (free school meals) achieved the L2 inclusive threshold. 66.9% of pupils achieved A*-C in maths. 70.4% of pupils achieved A*-C in either English or Welsh first language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gov.wales/statistics-and-research/examination-results/?lang=en|title=An annual report collated from examination bodies on the results of external examinations taken by pupils aged 15 or 17, which includes GCSE and A Levels by subject|last=|first=|date=7 December 2016|website=gov.wales|publisher=|language=EN|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PISA results, by which the performance of Welsh pupils is compared to that of other countries, is also of enormous concern, with Wales lagging behind all other countries in the UK, leading to the then Minister of Education Leighton Andrews to describe the performance as "unacceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11930257|title=Pisa tests show pupils in Wales falling behind|work=BBC News|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Education Consortia'''

There are four formal education consortia in Wales covering:
* North Wales (Flintshire, Conwy, Wrexham, Gwynedd, Isle of Anglesey, Denbighshire)
* South West and Mid Wales (Swansea, Neath Port Talbot, Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire, Powys, Ceredigion)
* Central South Wales (Bridgend, Cardiff, Merthyr Tydfil, Rhondda Cynon Taff, Vale of Glamorgan)
* South East Wales (Caerphilly, Monmouthshire, Newport, Blaenau Gwent, Torfaen)

Each of the consortia are responsible for school improvement services throughout their respective local authorities and schools.  Whilst all aspects of school improvement are considered consortia roles, they are specifically targeted with addressing the three Ministerial priorities of; improving levels of literacy, numeracy and reducing the impact of poverty on education attainment.

===Further education===
{{Main|List of further education colleges in Wales}}
[[Further education]] (FE) includes full- and part-time learning for people over compulsory school age, excluding higher education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1996/ukpga_19960056_en_2#pt1-ch1-pb1-l1g2 Education Act 1996, Part 1, Chapter 1, Paragraph 2]&lt;/ref&gt; FE and publicly funded training in Wales is provided by 15 FE institutions in 2014/15 and a range of public, private and voluntary sector training providers, such as the [[Workers' Educational Association]]. Colleges vary in size and mission, and include general FE, [[tertiary education|tertiary]] and specialist institutions, including one [[Roman Catholic]] Sixth Form College and a residential [[adult education]] college. Many colleges offer leisure learning and training programmes designed to meet the needs of business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fforwm.ac.uk Welcome to fforwm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228112011/http://www.fforwm.ac.uk/ |date=February 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntfw.org/index.php|title=National Training Federation Wales|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014/15 there were 263,315 FE students in Wales spanning the entire availability of FE at multiple placements, including FE, HE (higher education), LA (local authority) Community, and work-based learning.&lt;ref name="Key Education Statistics 2009"/&gt;

===Adult community learning===
[[Adult education|Adult Community learning]] is a form of adult education or [[lifelong learning]] delivered and supported by local authorities in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723043502/http://www.clwales.net/Introducing+CLW.htm|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=23 July 2011|website=archive.org|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programmes can be formal or [[Nonformal learning|informal]], non-accredited or accredited, and vocational, academic or leisure orientated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.wales.gov.uk/consultation/dells/2008/acl/aclconsultation-e.pdf;jsessionid=wPvGJZ6hkxSXLR9hg2kQTpzJQ5CWQ4dppwmyST0wDxZpthrQ2NGp!-582746490?lang=en Delivering Skills that Work for Wales: A new approach to Adult Community Learning. Consultation document issued 29 September 2008]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015/16 there were 28,710 learners in Local Authority Community Learning.&lt;ref name="Key Education Statistics 2009"/&gt;

===Higher education===
{{See also|List of universities in Wales}}
[[File:Cardiff University main building.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Main Building of Cardiff University]]
[[File:Uwlsdb.jpg|thumb|left|240px|St David's building of the University of Wales Lampeter - Wales' oldest University]]
Students normally enter higher education (HE) from 18 onwards. All undergraduate education is largely state-financed (with Welsh students contributing £1,255), and students are generally entitled to student loans for maintenance. The state does not control syllabi, but it does influence admission procedures and monitors standards through the [[Higher Education Funding Council for Wales]].

The typical first degree offered at Welsh universities is the [[Bachelor's degree]], typically taking three years to complete full-time. Some institutions offer an undergraduate master's degree as a first degree, typically lasting four years. During a first degree students are known as undergraduates. Some universities offer a vocationally based [[Foundation degree]], typically two years in length.

Within Wales, medical undergraduate education is provided by only [[Cardiff University]], while graduate fast track route training is provided at [[Swansea University]]. In recent years there has been an increase in the number of universities with their own degree awarding powers owing to the change in the [[University of Wales]] from a single awarding body for most of the Universities in Wales to a confederal structure, along with former institutes gaining university status. In 2014/15, there were 8 HE institutions in Wales including one music conservatoire, the [[Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama]] in Cardiff which is part of the University of Glamorgan Group. The [[University of Glamorgan]], the second largest university in Wales, has never been a member of the University of Wales and awards its own degrees: the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama also awards University of Glamorgan degrees.

In 2014/15 there were 145,735 enrolments at HE institutions in Wales, including 97,900 first degree and other undergraduates and 27,780 postgraduates. Welsh HE institutions had a total of 10,140 full-time and part-time staff.&lt;ref name="Key Education Statistics 2009" /&gt;

In 2012, the minister with responsibility for education within Wales, Leighton Andrews, made a significant statement in relation to the merger of Cardiff Metropolitan University (CMU, formerly UWIC), the University of Glamorgan and University of Wales, Newport (UWN),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-18877766|title=Cardiff Metropolitan University included in merger plan|work=BBC News|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he proposed the dissolution of CMU and UN as part of the process towards merger. However significant such changes may seem, it is arguable that the effective imposition of an average undergraduate fee of £7.5 K pa for the three institutions (and others, but not to Cardiff, Swansea, Bangor and Aberystwyth all of whom will charge £9 K pa) will cause much more substantial long term damage to these universities and reinvent the 'binary divide' between universities and the former polytechnics and HE institutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/education-news/2012/04/12/welsh-university-fees-set-to-fall-after-hefcw-decision-to-reallocate-spaces-91466-30740433/|title=Welsh university fees set to fall after Hefcw decision to reallocate spaces|date=11 April 2012|work=walesonline|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elena Smirnova''' ({{lang-ru|Елена Александровна Смирнова}}, 6 May 1888 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]])/18 May 1888 (N. S.) – 15 January 1934) was the last [[prima ballerina]] of the [[Mariinsky Theater]] in the [[Russian Empire|Imperial period of Russia]]. Starring in many leading roles, she often performed choreography created by [[Marius Petipa]] and {{ill|Boris G. Romanov|ru|Романов, Борис Георгиевич}}. Participating in early films of Germany and Russia, she made eight silent films and participated in the premiers of both the [[Ballets Russes]] in Paris and in the first performance of [[Russian ballet]] in Japan.

When the Soviets took over Russia, Smirnova fled with a group of artists, making their way to Berlin, where she and her husband founded the Russian Romantic Theater and performed throughout Europe until 1926. Experiencing a serious illness, she recuperated in Milan before relocating to Argentina, where she gave her last performance and became a dance instructor. She was the first professor of dance at the recently created [[Conservatorio Nacional de Música y Declamación]]. An annual award is given in her name by the National Dance School of Uruguay.

==Early life==
Elena Aleksandrovna Smirnova was born on 18 May 1888 in [[Saint Petersburg]], during the [[Russian Empire]].{{#tag:ref|Various Russian sources show the date as 6 May 1888 (O.S.).{{sfn|Деген|Ступников|2013}}{{sfn|Марков|1997}}{{sfn|Балет Фото|2012}} Her tombstone in the Chacarita Cemetery in Buenos Aires reflects the date 25 March 1888.{{sfn|Destaville|2013}}|group="Notes"}} She began her studies at the [[Imperial Ballet School]] under the instruction of [[Michel Fokine]] and [[Pavel Gerdt]]. Noted as a child prodigy, she began to perform at the [[Mariinsky Theater]] while she was still a student. In 1900, she played the role of Manu, in the ballet ''[[La Bayadère]]'' and in 1905, in the choreographic debut of Fokine, she played the part of Hymen in the ballet ''{{ill|Acis and Galatea (ballet)|lt=Acis and Galatea|ru|Ацис и Галатея (балеты)}}'' written by {{ill|Andrei Kadlec|ru|Кадлец, Андрей Вячеславович}}. Because of her good reviews, that same year, Fokine paired her with {{ill|Georgi Rozai|ru|Розай, Георгий Альфредович}} to dance to ''Polka with a Little Ball'' based on ''{{ill|Pizzicato Polka|it}}'' by [[Johann Strauss II|Johann]] and [[Josef Strauss]]. Completing her studies, Smirnova graduated in 1906, with her final performances as [[Titania]] in [[Marius Petipa]]'s ballet of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' choreographed by Folkine and in two duets with [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] in a dance to ''[[Étude Op. 25, No. 9 (Chopin)|Flight of the Butterflies]]'' by [[Chopin]] and to ''[[List of compositions by Mikhail Glinka|Waltz-Fantasia]]'' by [[Mikhail Glinka]].{{sfn|Борисоглебский|1939|pp=172–173}}{{sfn|Garafola|1989|pp=379–380}}

==Russian career==
As soon as Smirnova graduated, she was accepted into the ballet troupe at the Mariinsky Theater and began to receive small solo parts.  
In 1907, she performed a ''[[pas de deux]]'' with Nijinsky in ''[[La fille mal gardée]]'' for which critics praised her technical execution but noted that her movement lacked melodic interpretation.{{sfn|Красовская|1972|p=326}} The following year, she participated in a tour throughout the Russian provinces.{{sfn|Баринова|2017}} In 1909, the year [[Sergei Diaghilev]] founded the [[Ballets Russes]], she traveled to Paris, where she was listed among the company's principal dancers. She participated in the premiers of ''[[Le Pavillon d'Armide]]'' and "[[Polovtsian Dances]]" from the opera ''[[Prince Igor]]'' at the [[Théâtre du Châtelet]] on 18 May 1909.{{sfn|Destaville|2013}}{{sfn|Garafola|1989|pp=383–384}} Smirnova's performance in both roles received praise in London newspapers,{{sfn|''The Standard''|1909|p=6}} and the performances of "Polovtsian Dances" received enthusiastic standing ovations, which were credited with much of the fame Diaghilev's company received from the tour.{{sfn|Gadan|Maillard|Cohen|1959|p=108}} In 1910 she worked with the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] and participated in tours in London and New York, and though she starred in several productions, they were not particularly successful.{{sfn|Красовская|1972|p=332}}

[[File:Elena Smirnova by Alexandr Golovin.jpg|thumb|Elena Smirnova by Alexandr Golovin]]
In 1911, Smirnova performed in an alternating role of Swanilde with Elsa Vill in ''[[Coppélia]]'' by [[Léo Delibes]]. Critic [[Akim Volynsky]] called her performance heavy and complained that her "dances [[En pointe|on point]] could be heard in the farthest corners of the Maryinky’s enormous hall". He liked Vill's performance better, but overall was unsatisfied with both soloists in the role.{{sfn|Volynsky|Rabinowitz|2008|pp=10–11}} In her performance of "The Dance of the Frescoes" from ''[[The Little Humpbacked Horse (ballet)|The Little Humpbacked Horse]]'', Volynsky praised Smirnova's power, stating that she "put her best foot forward",{{sfn|Volynsky|Rabinowitz|2008|p=40}} overall commenting that her ''[[Glossary of ballet#Emboîté|emboîté]]'' was done "particularly well".{{sfn|Volynsky|Rabinowitz|2008|p=216}} In 1912, her role as Kitri in ''[[Don Quixote (ballet)|Don Quixote]]'' received acclaim by both critics and the public, which noted that the angularity of her performance in other roles, which seemed flawed, worked well in the production. Vera Krasovskaya noted that she was one of the best dancers who had performed the role.{{sfn|Красовская|1972|p=332}}

Beginning in 1913, Smirnova made a series of [[silent film]]s. A closed screening of a Berlin film ''Die Primaballerina'' (The Prima Ballerina) was released in April, showing Smirnova completing many of her own stunts.{{sfn|Баринова|2017}} Several films followed, including ''Die Augen der Bajadere'' (''The eyes of Bajadere'', 1913), ''Anita Iverson'' (1913), ''Die Ehre der Japanerin'' (''The Honor of the Japanese Woman'', 1913), ''Das Geheimnis der schwarzen Maske'' (''The Secret of the Black Mask'', 1913), ''Die Kleine Geisha'' (''The Little Geisha'', 1913), ''Das Vermächtnis der Mutter'' (''The Legacy of the Mother'', 1914) and ''Zigeunerblut'' (''Gypsy Blood'', 1914).{{sfn|German Early Cinema|1914}} In addition, to film, her leading roles in ballet included many which were choreographed by [[Marius Petipa]], such as Aspicia in ''[[The Pharaoh's Daughter]]'', the title role in ''[[Raymonda]]'', Izora in ''[[Bluebeard (ballet)|Bluebeard]]'', Niriti in ''[[The Talisman (ballet)|The Talisman]]'' and the title role in ''[[La Esmeralda (ballet)|Esmeralda]]'', among others.{{sfn|Деген|Ступников|2013}} She was also the first to perform the role of Mercedes in the ballet ''The Andalusian'' by her husband when it premiered in 1915.{{sfn|Деген|Ступников|2013}}{{sfn|Марков|1997}}

Smirnova was promoted to [[prima ballerina]] in 1916 and that same year was among a few dancers who performed at the [[Imperial Theatre (Japan)|Imperial Theater]] of [[Tokyo]] to great acclaim.{{sfn|Баринова|2017}} The tour, under the leadership of Smirnova's husband {{ill|Boris G. Romanov|ru|Романов, Борис Георгиевич}}, was first tour of Japan by a Russian ballet corps.{{sfn|Destaville|2013}} On the return trip, the troupe performed in [[Harbin]], China and passed through [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita, Russia]] on their way back to Saint Petersburg. During the [[Russian Civil War]], many noted dancers left Russia, which from 1918 left Smirnova as the only prima ballerina still working at the Mariinsky Theater. The theater name changed during the war to the State Academic Theater of Opera and Ballet ({{lang-ru|Gosudarstvennïy Akademicheskiy Teatr Operï i Baleta (GATOB)}}).{{sfn|Destaville|2013}}{{sfn|Баринова|2017}} During the seasons from 1918 to 1920, her most acclaimed role was as Aurora in ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]''.{{sfn|Деген|Ступников|2013}} In 1919, she danced in the premiere of ''Romance of the Rose'' by {{ill|Alexander Chekrygin|ru|Чекрыгин, Александр Иванович}} in the role of Rosa and then on 8 February 1920, performed her last role on the Russian stage.{{sfn|Красовская|1972|p=333}}

==European career==
Soon after the performance, Smirnova and Romanov, along with Romanov's mother and daughter, Natalia, {{ill|Anatoly Obukhov|ru|Обухов, Анатолий Николаевич}} and other artists, clandestinely left Russia fleeing from the [[Red Army|Bolshevik soldiers]] in 1920. Traveling in a hay cart, the group made their way to Romania and briefly performed in [[Bucharest]]. Then the artists moved to Berlin, where Romanov and Smirnova founded the Russian Theater a few months after their arrival in 1921. The theater was reorganized as the {{ill|Russian Romantic Theater|ru|Русский романтический театр}} ({{lang-de|Russisches Romantisches Theater}}) with the German dancer, Elsa Krüger the following year.{{sfn|Destaville|2013}}{{sfn|Mann|2002|p=2}}

Financed by a wealthy German patron, the theater staged a broad repertoire dedicated to Russian arts and included ballet, opera and pantomime, with Krüger, Obukhov, and Smirnova as the principal dancers. Based in Berlin, the company toured capitals of Europe{{sfn|Mann|2002|p=2}} performing one-act ballets like ''[[Les millions d'Arlequin]]'' by [[Riccardo Drigo]], ''Pastoral'' by [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], and ''Pictures of a Boyar Wedding'', among others.{{sfn|Соколов-Каминский|n.d.}} They staged a critically acclaimed adaptation of ''[[Giselle]]'',{{sfn|Craine|Mackrell|2010}} but many of their performances were avant-garde choreographies created by Romanov for Smirnova.{{sfn|Craine|Mackrell|2010}} In 1924, the troupe secured a seven-week engagement at the [[London Coliseum]],{{sfn|Mann|2002|p=2}} which proved unsuccessful. It was followed by a financially costly tour in Spain, which caused their backer to reduce the size of the company by almost half. Struggling financially, from the fall of 1924 to spring 1925, the troupe toured several German venues, but in March 1925, Smirnova was ill. She required a major operation from which her recovery was uncertain.{{sfn|Mann|2002|p=4}} In the fall of 1925, Romanov began rehearsing [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Trapeze (Prokofiev)|Trapeze]]'', which debuted in [[Gotha]] on 6 November 1925 and then was performed in Hanover and Turin,{{sfn|Mann|2002|p=5}} before the company folded in 1926.{{sfn|Craine|Mackrell|2010}}

Leaving Berlin, Smirnova and Romanov briefly lived in [[Milan]], where Romanov worked at [[La Scala]] and then served as the ballet master for [[Anna Pavlova]]'s ballet company.{{sfn|Craine|Mackrell|2010}}

==Argentinian career==
In 1928, the couple immigrated to Argentina along with Obukhov, because Romanov had been hired as the head choreographer for the [[Teatro Colón]] in [[Buenos Aires]]. Despite her slow recovery and continuing illness, Smirnova made her last appearance on the stage at the Teatro Colón that same year. She then became the theater's dance instructor, before being hired as the first professor of dance for the [[National Conservatory of Music and Recitation (Argentina)|National Conservatory of Music and Recitation]] ({{lang-es|Conservatorio Nacional de Música y Declamación}}). Besides her work at the Conservatory, Smirnova taught private lessons at the [[Teatro Odeón]] and at her private studio, which was located at 500 Tucumán Street. Among her students were: [[Esmee Bulnes]], {{ill|Ángel Eleta|es}}, [[Maruja Pibernat]], [[Mercedes Quintana]], and [[María Ruanova]].{{sfn|Destaville|2013}}

==Death and legacy==
Smirnova died on 15 January 1934 in Buenos Aires and was buried in the pantheon of actors of the [[Chacarita Cemetery]].{{sfn|Destaville|2013}} A dance prize given in her name is awarded annually by the National School of Dance of Uruguay.{{sfn|''Notimex''|2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3474">'''Equality of autonomy''' is a [[political philosophy]] concept of [[Amartya Sen]] that argues "that the ability and means to choose our life course should be spread as equally as possible across society"—i.e., an equal chance at [[autonomy]] or [[empowerment]].&lt;ref name=twsO23&gt;{{cite news |author= Sunder Katwala |title= It's equality of life chances, not literal equality, that the left espouses |work= [[The Guardian]] |date= 21 October 2010 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/21/equality-life-chances-not-literal-left |accessdate= 2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equality of autonomy strives to spread empowerment widely so that "given their circumstances", people have more "choice and control".&lt;ref name=twsO24&gt;{{cite news|title=Equality Impact Assessments |publisher=''Hull Teaching Primary Care'' |date=2011-07-15 |url=http://www.hullpct.nhs.uk/impact_assessments/ |accessdate=2011-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307214013/http://www.hullpct.nhs.uk/impact_assessments/ |archivedate=2012-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has a slightly different emphasis from related notions, such as the value of [[Inequality in the workplace|equality in the workplace]] ("[[equal opportunity]]") or equal material wealth ("[[equality of outcome]]").
 
According to [[Todd May]], Sen's approach requires "[[Economic interventionism|active intervention]] of institutions like the state into people's lives" but with an aim towards "fostering of people's self-creation rather than their living conditions".&lt;ref name=twsO25&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Todd May]] |title= The Political Thought of Jacques Rancière: Creating Equality |publisher= The Pennsylvania State University Press |quote= Amartya Sen has developed a theory of [[distributive justice]] that, like [[John Rawls|Rawls]]', requires the active intervention of institutions like the state into people's lives, but like [[Robert Nozick|Nozick]]'s, aims that intervention at the fostering of people's self-creation rather than their living conditions. For Sen, the proper focus of a theory of justice is on what he calls ''capabilities'', and he defines those capabilities on the basis of what he calls ''functionings''. |page=20  |year= 2008 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JJYjY8sG85kC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=%22equality+of+autonomy%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zHHGkwrGBm&amp;sig=J6qBAQ5E5UjlZZz4Usv0UQ_5ElI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZpAjTrjdCpO40AH_g8ilAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22equality%20of%20autonomy%22&amp;f=false
 |accessdate= 2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sen argued that "the ability to convert incomes into opportunities is affected by a multiplicity of individual and social differences that mean some people will need more than others to achieve the same range of [[Capability approach|capabilities]]".&lt;ref name=twsO45&gt;{{cite journal |author= Anne Phillips |title= Defending Equality of Outcome |journal= Journal of Political Philosophy |year= 2004 |pages= 1–19 |url= http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/533/ |accessdate= 2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fiji Teachers Union (FTU)''' is a [[trade union|union]] representing elementary and secondary education teachers in [[Fiji]]. It is a member of the [[Fiji Trades Union Congress]],&lt;ref name="Gounder"&gt;Neelesh Gounder, "A Long Road to Unity," ''Fiji Times,'' January 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Education International]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ei-ie.org/annualreport/ei-ie/uk/part_06_members67fe.html?tri=Pays&amp;sel=Asia&amp;inc_coun=yes&amp;inc_add=yes&amp;inc_pho=yes&amp;inc_web=yes "Membership List: Asia-Pacific," Education International, no date.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The FTU was formed as a multi-racial organization. However, in 1960 the [[Fijian Teachers Union]] (FTA) was founded. The FTA limited its membership to indigenous Fijians. Most indigenous Fijian educators left the FTU, so that the FTU's membership is now overwhelmingly [[India]]n.&lt;ref name="Gaunder"&gt;Padmini Gaunder, ''Education and Race Relations in Fiji, 1835-1998,'' Universal Printing, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the Fiji Teachers Union counted about 4,200 members (including over 700 indigenous Fijians). The Fiji Teachers’ Association had about 3,500 members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apheda.org.au/projects/pacific/pages/files/Waiting%20for%20something%20to%20happen%20FINAL.pdf Chris Chevalier, Ken Davis and Bill Leslie, ''Waiting for Something to Happen: Trade Union Responses to HIV/AIDS in the South Pacific: Report of a Needs Analysis Survey for ILO and SPOCTU,'' Union Aid Abroad – APHEDA, Sydney, Australia, July 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==

=== Methodist Teachers' Association ===

By 1924 there were a significant number of local and overseas trained in Fiji, who saw the need for an organised group of teachers to discuss their professional and administrative matters. Under the leadership of Sewak Masih (of Toorak Boys’ School), the Methodist Teachers’ Association was formed and had members from Suva and Rewa. It adopted a motto: “To serve the Community is to serve God”.
This association of teachers kept meeting in Suva until 1927 when Sewak Masih was transferred to Levuka and this gave him an opportunity to invite all the teachers from Suva, Ba, Lautoka and Nadi to attend a conference in Levuka. A teacher by the name of Dukhharan travelled with his group from the Western Districts to attend this meeting. Among other matters a plan for a united organization of teachers was kumar

Another conference of the Methodist Teachers’ Association was held at Methodist Boys’ School in Toorak in 1928 where the following office bearers were elected: President: Sewak Masih, Vice President: P M Stephen, Secretary: G P Andrew and Assistant Secretary: HR Narayan. [[John Bairagi]] was elected as Secretary International and BR Padarath was chosen as the Treasurer.
Professional lectures were presented during the afternoon dinner by I J Beatie (M.A) on the topic “Reality in Education” and by G H Tindlay (M.A.) on “Psychology”.

=== Lautoka Teachers' Association ===

There was no such organised association of teachers in the western side of Vitilevu; however, a meeting was convened at Natabua on Saturday 7 December 1929. The following teachers were present at this meeting: D A Shah, Dukharan, P M Stephen, D S John, W K Phillip, A V Ram Narayan, B L Ram Dass, R Varo, B H Sanjeu, Gulam Dastgir, J S Maiku, Jacob Wara, Peter Vatu, Farzand Ali and Pt Ami Chandra. C S Sharp, the principal of Natabua Secondary was invited to declare the meeting open.

As a result of this gathering of teachers an association called The Lautoka Teachers’ Association was formed under the chairmanship of Pt [[Ami Chandra]]. Dukharan was elected as the Vice President and W K Phillip became the Secretary/Treasurer. There was a committee of four executive members namely Robert Varo, D S John, P M Stephen and William. So by 1929 there were two Teachers’ Unions, one in the Central and the other in the Western Division but with similar aims and objectives.

=== Union of the two Associations ===

Majority of the local teachers were the products of Davuilevu Teachers’ Training Institute but the opening of Natabua Teachers’ training Institute and the Cawaci Centre in 1929 produced more trained teachers for the schools.
The administration of education in those days was done under the guidance and direction of the Director of Education but the status and service condition of the teachers were somewhat insecure and uncertain. Teachers were often victimised, over worked, underpaid and above all had to please many masters or bosses. The two newly formed teachers’ organizations were not strong enough to voice their opinions and protests to bring harmony in the profession. The solution as seen by the teachers at that time lay in the creation of a united body of teachers for all of Fiji.
On 9 March 1930 the Lautoka Teachers’ Association decided to hold a conference for all the teachers of Fiji. A lot of teachers from Suva could not attend the Lautoka meeting because of the transport difficulty and the inclement weather. They held their own meeting in Suva. This date became historic for the Fiji Teachers’ Union because it was at these meetings that the decision to amalgamate the Suva and Lautoka Teachers’ Associations was made. 
Following Indian teachers from Lautoka were part of the historic decision: Dukharan, (Chairman) P M Steven, P Frank, D A Shah, S P Ram, A V Ram Narayan, B L R Dass, Shiu Charan, C William, G M Prakash, D S John, M Munam, Farzand Ali, J S Maiku, Ram Jati Singh, Ram Sundar, Rameshwar Prasad, Sher Mohammed, Badri Prasad, Kripa Masih, Andrew G Prasad and Dastgir and there were eight Fijian teachers there as well: M/s Logavatu, I Racule, Tevita, Asaeli, Kepuli, Jona, Maikeli, Isireli and Peni Tonga.
Suva teachers who held their historic meeting to vote for amalgamation included the following: Sewak Masih (Chairman), Hakim Din, B Samuel Sharan, N S Deoki, J John, K P Singh, H R Ram Narayan, J R Lochan, S Bharat, R D Sharma, D P Mishra, Edward Rama, Hari Bhajan, Ami Chandra, Hari Pal, A D Sharma, J S Bhagwan, Hira Lal, B R Padarath, B H Sanjeu, John Bairagi, George Sukhdeo, Shiu Mangal, B Ram Singh and T R Sharma. Fijian teachers Phillip Cula, T Rawasalevu, W Tuiwaqa, Sairusi Natuna and Inoke Cakutini were also present.
The meeting was co-chaired by Dukharan and Sewak Masih. The Conference adopted the motto of the Union with the slogan, “The Child Our Hope”. The Principal of Natabua Secondary C S Sharp officially opened the historic meeting and a secondary teacher E Mason presented a professional paper for discussion. W K Phillip presented the Annual Reports of the Unions. He had taken over the position of secretary from AG Prasad who had resigned earlier in the year.

The planning and organising of the Fiji Teachers’ Union that had begun in 1930 was completed in 1931 when the two teachers’ organizations of that time met at Natabua in Lautoka on 19 and 20 June and finally elected the officials of the National Executive. Mr S Hari Charan chaired the election procedures when D A Shah was elected the first President and Sewak Masih and S Hari Charan became the two Vice Presidents. R H Ram Narayan was elected the General Secretary with W K Phillip as his Assistant Secretary. J R Lochan became the Treasurer of the Union and there were twelve executive committee members: B H Sanjeu, R Deoki, S Parshu Ram, Andrew G Prasad, S Ram Singh, Tulsi R Sharma, Phillip Cula, I Racule, T Rawasalevu, W Tuiwaqa, Sairusi Natuni and Inoke Cakutini.
At last the dream of Sewak Masih became a reality when the Fiji Teachers’ Union was formed to represent all the teachers of Fiji. Total strength of the Union in 1931 was 112 and this included 18 Fijian members. Membership of the Union was open to all the teachers teaching in Fiji irrespective of their race, colour and creed.

After 1931 the Fiji Teachers’ Union members have been meeting regularly for their annual conferences during the first term school holidays. These meetings or conferences have been providing good opportunities to the teachers to meet each other and exchange their views and ideas. These meetings have been helping the members to make new acquaintances and learn new skills, ideas and knowledge through lectures and discussions. These conferences have also provided them a forum for active participation to further their professionalism and to update their rights and responsibilities.
The venues for these Annual General Meetings depended on the branch invitations but from 1931 to 1938 they were held alternatively in Suva and Lautoka. During these years the Presidency of the Union was shared by two prominent teachers of that time, Dildhar Ali Shah and Ami Chandra. In 1939 however, the Ba Branch of the Union invited them to hold the Conference there and it was a successful event. Nadi was the next branch, which hosted the eleventh Conference in 1941 when the President was Hari Charan, who became the longest serving President of the Union-17 years.
Other teachers who served as President of the Union were James Madhwan(8 years),NR Ram Krishna (1 Year), Ambika Nand (3 years), J R Lochan(1 Year), K C Ramrakha(8 years), Krishna Dutt(3 years), Shiu N Kanhai(3 years), Shiu Charan, and Anil Sudhakar.

The FTU registered with the national government as a trade union in 1947.&lt;ref name="Gaunder" /&gt;

==1950s and 1960s==
In 1930, FTU president was Dildar Ali Shah and the Secretary was W K Phillip after the Lautoka Teachers' Association and the Suva Teachers' Association amalgamated and changed the name to Fiji Teachers' Union with "The Child Our Hope" as its motto. Dildar Shah served as President until 1933 when Ami Chandra took over and remained President until 1935. ref Dr. RL Prasad(1980)

[[K. C. Ramrakha]] was President of the Fiji Teachers Union from 1967 to 1973. He was also elected the General Secretary of the National Federation Party. Ramrakha was the first non-teacher to hold the position of President. His election and his leading role in the [[National Federation Party]] caused the Fijian Teachers Association to withdraw from merger talks between the two unions.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Mamak, ''Colour, Culture &amp; Conflict,'' Pergamon Press, 1978. {{ISBN|0-08-023353-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-independence==
In after Fiji won its independence in 1970 FTU and FTA formed the Fiji Teachers' Confederation to give them more [[collective bargaining]] power. About 1983 the President, J Singh and Vice President, Soubhagyawati Parshu Ram (first female) led the FTU Suva branch. Ms S P Ram is the daughter of former Parliamentarian, J B Tularam. The Confederation led a major teachers' [[strike action|strike]] in 1985 which led to the formation of the [[Fiji Labour Party]].  The formation of the Fiji Labour Party led to radical changes in Fijian politics (including two coups) in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="Gaunder" /&gt;

The FTU remains competitive with the FTA for members. In 2005 and 2006, for example, many members of the FTA left that organization to join the FTU after the FTU founded a [[credit union]] which offered high interest rates on savings.&lt;ref name="Gounder" /&gt;

In 2006, the elected civilian government of Fiji was toppled in a [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|military coup d'état]]. In 2007, the interim government instituted a 5 percent across-the-board wage cut for all public employees. Most public sector workers' unions struck in August 2007, seeking restoration of the salary cut and a reduction in the retirement age from 60 to 55. The FTU joined the strike.

The contestants included six twenty-somethings that applied through a write-in contest: Krishtine de Leon is a local [[hip-hop]] magazine editor from San Francisco, CA; Peter Maiden, an [[Australian]] [[college student]] at [[UC Berkeley]]; Tika Milan, a [[lesbian]] [[poet]] and [[freelance]] [[journalist]] from [[Brooklyn]]; Russell Morse, a former juvenile delinquent turned reporter for a local [[San Francisco]] newspaper; [[Krystal Ann Simpson]] from [[Salinas, California|Salinas]] with a love for [[classic rock]]; and Colin Stutz, a 20-year-old [[University of Southern California]] student from [[Oregon]].

==Results==

In the last episode [[Jann Wenner]], [[Joe Levy]], and a team of senior editors individually reviewed all the contestants and their performance in the 2 months previous.  Colin Stutz was perceived as a passionate person that looks like the rolling stone-type, however too "green" for a full-time position.   [[Krystal Ann Simpson]] was the most enthusiastic about the idea for working at [[Rolling Stone]], but was ultimately able to accomplish the least for the magazine.  She was viewed as more attracted to the [[socialite]], [[red carpet]] lifestyle, but uninterested in the actual work of being a music reporter.  She was unable to produce any substance for the magazine, and was not considered as a viable candidate for the position.  Russell Morse had the most raw talent as a writer, but was wildly irresponsible and showed no discipline as an [[employee]].  Failure to attend work regularly, tardiness, and disrespect for his superiors as well as interview subjects were cited as reasons for his exclusion. The editors felt that Peter Maiden was smart and enthusiastic, as well as a good employee but lacking journalistic experience. His failure to turn in professional caliber pieces worried the editors, but he was still noticed by [[Jann Wenner|Wenner]], who considered giving him an additional internship.  Krishtine was viewed arrogant in the beginning of the [[internship]], but her knowledge of hip-hop was invaluable in the last four weeks.  Tika Milan started very strong in the initial stages of the show, but it was perceived that she gave up towards the end, producing very little material and not aggressively pursuing stories.

Later it was revealed that the winner of the year-long contributing editor position was Krishtine de Leon.  It was speculated that her extensive understanding of [[hip-hop]] music and [[hip-hop culture|culture]] and her ability to turn in usable, relevant material was what catapulted her over the top.

==After ''I'm from Rolling Stone'' ==

Peter Maiden is now a video editor for ''Rolling Stone''.  He is also a bartender in New York.  Tika Milan is a [[freelance writer]] for a new magazine called Dapper.  Russell Morse returned to [[San Francisco]] and his position at New American Media. He now works as an Outreach Coordinator at a Youth Development Organization called The Door in [[Manhattan]]. [[Krystal Ann Simpson]] currently splits her time between [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City|New York]] designing, modeling, and writing for her social commentary blog WhatisRealityAnyway.com.&lt;ref name="coach"&gt;{{cite news | title=BLOG OR BAG | first=Faran | last=Krentcil | date=2010-05-12 | work=Nylon magazine | publisher=[[Nylon (magazine)|Nylon]] | url=http://www.nylonmag.com/?section=article&amp;parid=4606 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colin Stutz returned to Los Angeles to complete his junior year at [[University of Southern California|USC]] and work as the editorial assistant at Filter Magazine.

== Viewership ==
The show was plagued by low ratings, getting only 369,000 viewers for the premiere episode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwd.com/notavailable/archive?target=/issue/article/111905&amp;articleId=111905&amp;articleType=A&amp;industryKw=issue WWD: ROLLING FLAT]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129020450/http://www.wwd.com/notavailable/archive?target=%2Fissue%2Farticle%2F111905&amp;articleId=111905&amp;articleType=A&amp;industryKw=issue |date=January 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To further exacerbate the problem, the show's time slot was also  pushed back to 11 PM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://idolator.com/tunes/tv/im-from-rolling-stone-episode-guide-part-six-237778.php Idolator: I'm From Rolling Stone, Episode Guide, Part 6] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222125422/http://idolator.com/tunes/tv/im-from-rolling-stone-episode-guide-part-six-237778.php |date=February 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The show was generally considered a flop due to very little promotion and its aim towards an older demographic, thus it was not renewed for a second season.

From 1912 to 1914, she taught at a [[middle school]] in [[Braine-le-Comte]].&lt;ref name=gubin&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fIPj8NRvuNAC&amp;pg=PA38 |title=Dictionnaire des femmes belges: XIXe et XXe siècles |year=2006 |ISBN=2873864346 |last=Gubin |first=Eliane|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bastin spent [[World War I]] in [[England]] and studied languages at [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]], particularly French literature from the [[Middle Ages]]. She was also a teaching assistant for French conversation and composition courses at the college. Afterwards, she taught in [[secondary school]]s in [[Derbyshire]] and then [[Yorkshire]]. From 1920 to 1931, she lived in [[Paris]], attending the [[École pratique des hautes études]] and the [[Sorbonne]] where she studied [[Old French]] and [[Old Occitan]]. She was able to attend classes taught by [[Alfred Jeanroy]] and [[Edmond Faral]].&lt;ref name=arllfb/&gt;

In 1928, she translated [[Aldous Huxley]]'s novel [[Crome Yellow]] into French as ''Jaune de Crome''. In 1932, she translated [[Johan Huizinga]]'s ''Herfsttijd der Middeleeuwen'' into French as ''Le déclin du Moyen Âge''. That same year, she translated Huxley's ''[[Those Barren Leaves]]'' into French as ''Marina di Vezza''; that translation was awarded the [[Académie française]]'s Prix Langlois.&lt;ref name=arllfb/&gt;

In 1929 and 1930, Bastin published the two volumes of ''Recueil général des Isopets'', a collection of [[fable]]s from the Middle Ages. With [[Edmond Faral]], she was editor for ''Onze Poèmes concernant la Croisade, par [[Rutebeuf]]'', published in 1946, and for ''Œuvres complètes de Rutebeuf'', which was released in two volumes in 1958 and 1960.&lt;ref name=arllfb/&gt;

In 1931, she joined the [[Romance studies]] department of the [[Université libre de Bruxelles]]. She became the first female member of the [[Académie royale de langue et de littérature françaises de Belgique]] in 1947.&lt;ref name=gubin/&gt;

Bastin died in [[Sint-Agatha-Berchem]] at the age of 80.&lt;ref name=arllfb/&gt;

'''''Math Blaster!''''' is a 1983 educational video game, and the first entry in the ''Math Blaster'' series within the [[Blaster Learning System]]. The game was developed by former educator Jan Davidson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=iVRN2dzy_zUC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=%22math+blaster%22+%221983%22+OR+%221984%22+OR+%221985%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiescHL2vjRAhUMbbwKHWrJC2AQ6AEIKTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22math%20blaster%22%20%221983%22%20OR%20%221984%22%20OR%20%221985%22&amp;f=false|title=Engineering Play: A Cultural History of Children's Software|last=Ito|first=Mizuko|date=2012-02-10|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262291552|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be remade and re-released a number of times starting with ''[[Math Blaster Plus!]]'' and followed by ''New Math Blaster Plus''. A complete makeover over was done for ''[[Math Blaster Episode I: In Search of Spot]]'' in 1993.

The game eventually spawned other Math Blaster games and spin-offs such as ''Alge Blaster'', ''Reading Blaster'' and ''[[Math Blaster Mystery: The Great Brain Robbery]]''.

== Gameplay ==
An arcade-style educational game that offers skill-building mathematical exercises, The title contains minigames that test players' knowledge in subjects such as particular addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, percentages, and decimals. A series of mathematics problems appear on the screen, and the player must move to fire the cannon pointing at the correct answer. The game included an editor for teachers and parents to design their own problems.

While this title was purely a drill and practice, its 1987 sequel would wrap the activity around a narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Ge8qDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=%22math+blaster!%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiynIfz1fjRAhVFhrwKHds2AhwQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22math%20blaster!%22&amp;f=false|title=Choosing and Using Digital Games in the Classroom: A Practical Guide|last=Becker|first=Katrin|date=2016-10-04|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319122236|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational Goals ==
Math Blaster was designed to aid students to master mathematics grades 1 through 6 in an exciting and interesting manner. The learning activities were graphically-appealing in motivating and challenging students.&lt;ref name=MB-AtariBox/&gt;

== Commercial performance ==
After it was developed, Math Blaster! was extensively tested in classrooms.&lt;ref name=MB-AtariBox/&gt; By November 2, 1985, the game had sustained 92 weeks on the Billboard charts for Top Education Computing Software, and was currently at #2. The game, plus its various sequels and spin-offs, has since become the best-selling piece of maths software in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=iVRN2dzy_zUC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=%22math+blaster%22+%221983%22+OR+%221984%22+OR+%221985%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiescHL2vjRAhUMbbwKHWrJC2AQ6AEIKTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22math%20blaster%22%20%221983%22%20OR%20%221984%22%20OR%20%221985%22&amp;f=false|title=Engineering Play: A Cultural History of Children's Software|last=Ito|first=Mizuko|date=2012-02-10|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262291552|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
''[[InfoWorld]]'' praised the game for its high resolution graphics, and considered it a standout title in the drill-and-practice edutainment video game genre, and deemed it a perfect teache's aid primary school classroom use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=wi8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=%22math+blaster!%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiynIfz1fjRAhVFhrwKHds2AhwQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22math%20blaster!%22&amp;f=false|title=InfoWorld|last=Inc|first=InfoWorld Media Group|date=1983-07-11|publisher=InfoWorld Media Group, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8042">[[Image:Ylioppilaslakki.jpg|thumb|right|The Finnish abitur gives the right to wear the [[student cap]]]]

The '''Finnish Matriculation Examination''' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''ylioppilastutkinto'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''studentexamen'') is [[matriculation examination|the examination]] taken at the end of [[secondary education]] to qualify for entry into [[university]]. The test also constitutes the high school's final exam(s); in other words, it is a high school graduation exam. Since 1919, the test has been arranged by a national body, the Matriculation Examination Board. Before that, the administration of the test was the responsibility of the [[University of Helsinki]].

Under a previous law, successful completion entitled one to enroll as a university student (hence "[[matriculation]]"). Although the legal requirement has been lifted, matriculation without completing the test is still an exception. The universities are now free to arrange their own entrance examinations in addition to considering scores from the matriculation examination. Thus, universities accept students based on the entrance exam points, the matriculation exam points, and also a combined score of these two. Successfully passing the test entitles one to wear the Finnish [[student cap]].

==Exams==
Each examinee is required to participate in at least four tests in order to pass the exam. {{as of|2005}} the only mandatory part of the test is that of ''äidinkieli'' ("mother tongue"; Finnish for most students, [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Northern Sami language|Northern Sámi]], [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sámi]], or [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sámi]] for some), including a composition test. The student then has to choose three other subjects from:
* ''Second domestic language'': ([[Mandatory Swedish|Swedish for Finnish speakers]] or Finnish for [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish speakers]])
* ''Foreign language'': Languages are separated into A and B levels depending on the demanded skill. The language counted as part of the four obligatory subjects must be one of A-level. However, if a student takes advanced level mathematics as an obligatory subject, he may take B-level language exams. English, German and French are the most popular choices among students, but in addition, the students may take Russian, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Latin, [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sámi]], and [[Northern Sámi]] exams. The foreign language exams include listening and reading comprehension tests, a grammar test and an essay.
* ''Mathematics'': (ordinary or advanced level), including 15 assignments 10 of which must be completed.
* ''Reaali" ("realämnen'' in Swedish): Here the examinees take exams in individual subjects and are only allowed to answer questions from a single subject per exam. There is no limitation in the number of individual exams taken, but as tests in multiple subjects are held at the same time, it is practically possible to attend two exams two times per year. The subjects taken by the examinee have to be chosen well in advance prior to the exam. Exams consist of questions which require answers in the form of an [[essay]]. The subjects in the ''reaali'' category are
** Religion, Evangelical Lutheran
** Religion, Orthodox Christian
** Education on ethics and moral history
** Philosophy
** Psychology
** History
** Civics
** Physics
** Chemistry
** Biology
** Geography
** Health education

[[Image:Ylioppilastutkintolautakunnan logo.svg|thumb|right|100px|The insignia of Finnish matriculation exam board]]
The exam takes place at schools according to minute regulations laid out by the national board. Each exam takes six hours. After the exam, the teachers grade the papers and send the graded papers to the national board which then re-grades every paper. The grading of the exam may be appealed against. In this case, the board re-examines the grading. The result of the re-examination is final and cannot be appealed to any authority.

==Scoring==
The score of each test varies with the subject. For example, the maximum score for the test in Finnish or Swedish as a first language is 114 points, in mathematics 66 points and in foreign languages 299 points. The tests are graded according to [[normal distribution]] into seven verbal [[Academic grading in Finland#Gymnasium|grades]] with [[Latin]] names: ''improbatur'' (I), ''approbatur'' (A), ''lubenter approbatur'' (B), ''cum laude approbatur'' (C), ''magna cum laude approbatur'' (M), ''eximia cum laude approbatur'' (E) and ''laudatur'' (L), from bottom to top. (A rough literal translation of the grades is "not approved", "approved", "gladly approved", "approved with praise", "approved with much praise", "approved with exceptional praise", and "praised"/"lauded".) In general, at least the grade A is required for the test to be passed. The grades received by the students generally follow a distribution of:
* 5% of students receive a ''laudatur'' (L)
* 15% of students receive an ''eximia cum laude approbatur'' (E)
* 20% of students receive a ''magna cum laude approbatur'' (M)
* 24% of students receive a ''cum laude approbatur'' (C)
* 20% of students receive a ''lubenter approbatur'' (B)
* 11% of students receive an ''approbatur'' (A)
* 5% of students receive an ''improbatur'' (I).

This distribution is such that one grade on the scale is equivalent to approximately one standard deviation; 64% are within M-B and 90% within E-A.

Traditionally, the test is taken in the spring, but it is also arranged every autumn and may be taken in up to three parts. Thus completing the matriculation exam may take up to one and a half years. Usually, the last set of exams is taken at the end of the third year in upper secondary school. The exams take place in late March, but for the school-leavers, the school ends in mid-February, giving the students ample time to prepare for the test in solitary study. This occasion is celebrated by the traditional festivity of [[penkkarit]].

==Compensation system==
Students who receive an ''improbatur'' in any of the obligatory exams fail the entire exam. However, a single failed obligatory exam may be compensated for by good results in other exams. Based on the compensation system, the total exam score of the student is calculated and compared with the result of the failed test. To receive their diploma, a student must accumulate sufficient compensation points from the other exams. The ''improbatur'' is divided into four classes (i+,&amp;nbsp;i,&amp;nbsp;i&amp;minus;,&amp;nbsp;i=), each describing the degree of a student's failure (i+ is the least failure), and each class has its own number of compensation points needed for an acceptable result (12, 14, 16 and 18 respectively). Points from accepted exams are awarded as follows: ''L'', seven points; ''E'', six; ''M'', five; ''C'', four; ''B'', three and ''A'', two.

==Digitalisation==
The Matriculation Examination is currently under a process of digitalisation. The first digital tests were held in the autumn of 2016 in geography, philosophy and German language. The last test to become digital will be the mathematics test in spring 2019. From then on traditional paper tests will no longer be organised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ylioppilastutkinto.fi/en/matriculation-examination/digital-matriculation-examination|title=Digital Matriculation Examination|website=ylioppilastutkinto.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new digital system worth 3-5 million euros is being built by Finnish tech company [[Reaktor (company)|Reaktor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tamperegoesagile.fi/slides2016/Strandell.pdf|title=Experimentation in a National Public Sector Project |website=Tampere Goes Agile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mr. Know-It-Owl's Video School''' was a series of videos released on [[videocassette]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=A-to-Z software index: A retailer's guide to the garden world of children's entertainment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7iQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT72&amp;lpg=PT72&amp;dq=%22Apollo+Educational+Video%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hk6P7ZLwx6&amp;sig=iYJrMWuR9gyz5DYOdbbz3-HPDuM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=X9obTsioNJGtgQfIz-zHCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Apollo%20Educational%20Video%22&amp;f=false |magazine=Billboard |volume=98|issue=30|pages=K3,K8|publisher= Nielsen Business Media, Inc |date=26 July 1986 |access-date=2017-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later repurposed to interactive CD-ROM, and is hosted by a purple owl puppet.  The Mr. Know-It-Owl series was copyrighted by Apollo Educational Video (the home video arm of  AIMS Media, later AIMS Multimedia).  Aimed at younger children, Mr. Know-It-Owl (a play on "[[know-it-all]]"), attempts to educate children in [[safety]], [[health]], [[grammar]], and the [[The three Rs|three Rs]].  There were over 10 videos released and a series of CD-ROM.  The main characters were Phineas (a firefly), Scooter McGruder (a [[puppet]] child with red hair), and of course, Mr. Know-It-Owl (the purple [[owl]] with glasses).

==Main characters==
===Mr. Know-It-Owl===

Mr. Know-It-Owl mostly has purple feathers but has shiny blue ones over his chest area and wears yellowish circular glasses.  He lives inside a tree hollowed out to be his home.  It includes a bookshelf with several books.  He also has a globe, on which the firefly perched from time to time.  A chalkboard appeared in one episode.  While teaching a lesson, Mr. Know-It-Owl uses "the Window of Knowledge," which is a round window near the top of his tree that opens up before the video tutorial begins.

Mr. Know-It-Owl returned in a series of Interactive CD-ROM in 1997 where he was voiced by AIMS Multimedia co-president and an executive producer of the series- David S. Sherman, Ph.D.

===Scooter McGruder===

Scooter is a curious young boy with red hair, green eyes, and a yellow shirt with the letter "E" on it in red.  He is often the one that is instructed by Mr. Know-It-Owl.

===Phineas===

Phineas is a firefly that lives with Mr. Know-It-Owl in his treehouse; his full name is Phineas T. Firefly.

==Videos==

Over 10 videos of the Mr. Know-It-Owl series were made.  The following video titles are listed below, along with their summaries.

*''African Animals (Animals of Africa)''
*''All About Animals''
*''Arithmetic for Kids''
*''Dinosaurs and Strange Creatures'' (1988)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mr. Know It Owl's Video School|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrvEoUeHDwU}}&lt;/ref&gt;: Mr. Know It Owl introduces [[dinosaurs]], using stop-motion animation dinosaur figures. Among the dinosaurs shown are [[Allosaurus]] (seen in the opening sequence), [[Brontosaurus]], [[Coelophysis]], [[Stegosaurus]], [[Anatosaurus]], [[Corythosaurus]], [[Parasaurolophus]], [[Saurolophus]], [[Pteranodon]], [[Ankylosaurus]], [[Chasmosaurus]], [[Monoclonius]], [[Styracosaurus]], [[Triceratops]], and [[Tyrannosaurus rex]]. Afterwards is a segment about prehistoric mammals. Once again, stop motion animation figures are used. Some of the creatures which are shown are [[Deltatheridium]], [[Eohippus]], [[Diatryma]], [[Platybelodon]], [[Baluchitherium]], [[Glyptodon]], [[Megatherium]], [[Smilodon]], and the [[woolly mammoth]]. Finally is a segment about various animal adaptations, including [[anteaters]], and [[chameleons]].
*''Dragons and Sailboats''
*''Grammar as Easy as ABC''
*''Learning As We Play''
*''Letters, Colors, and Ducks''
*''MacDonald's Farm''
*''Make Your Own Toys - Toys At Your Fingertips''
*''Nature's Systems''

*''Health Tips'' (1986): The following videos are shown, with a total running time of approximately 45 minutes: 
**''The Junk Food Man'' (10 minutes)
**''Nutrition: Try It, You'll Like It'' (11 minutes) 
**''Magic Weapons For Healthy Teeth'' (15 minutes)
**''Ear Care'' (9 minutes).

*''Safety Tips'' (1986): When Scooter moves, Mr. Know-It-Owl gives him several important safety tips in four short videos. The first, ''Emergencies: What Would You Do?'' (1977), deals with handling emergencies like drowning, ingesting chemicals, bleeding, and falling.  The second features ''Roscoe's Rules'' (1973), in which a drumming bear toy offers tips on how to avoid strangers.  The third is called ''Hush Puppy's Bright Idea'' (1976), in which the puppets emphasize the importance of wearing reflective materials and being careful at night.  The fourth and final video ''Electrical Safety: A to Zap'' (1970), was an animated spiel about a naive housecat who receives a long lecture from a pink mouse about electrical safety.

*''Under the Sea''
*''Weather'' (1987): Mr. Know-It-Owl's tutorial involves weather and how nature acts to cause the various weather patterns.  It is 32 minutes long.

==Interactive multimedia==

The series was later re-purposed into the interactive CD-ROM by AIMS Multimedia co-president and executive producer David S. Sherman and software architect Richard Williams, both of whom went on to design and produce AIMS Multimedia's [[DigitalCurriculum]] in 1999, the first educational video streaming [[software as a service]] (SaaS), a video curriculum on demand which was later sold to the Discovery Channel in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery Acquires AIMS Multimedia|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/14540528/discovery-education-acquires-aims-multimedia-consolidating-video-market-k-12-schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery Acquires AIMS|url=http://www.berkerynoyes.com/news/pr_4.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CD-ROM Mr. Know-It-Owl character was also voiced by Dr. Sherman.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4384">The '''National Platform Open Science''' ('''NPOS''') – (in Dutch: ''Nationaal Platform Open Science'') – in The Netherlands is a collaboration of 17 [[Netherlands|Dutch]] organisations of higher education and research intent on realising [[Open Science]]. Among its members are the [[Umbrella organisation]] of Dutch universities ([[Vereniging van Universiteiten|VSNU]]), the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (KNAW), the [[Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research]] (NWO), the [[National Library of the Netherlands]] (KB), and the like. The Platform brings together the parties that have initiated, formulated, or support the ''National Plan Open Science'', that has been presented to the Dutch government in the beginning of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.openscience.nl/binaries/content/assets/subsites-evenementen/open-science/national_plan_open_science_the_netherlands_february_2017_en_.pdf National Plan Open Science (English version)]&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Nationaal_plan_open_science.pdf|thumb]]

== Ambition ==
NPOS aims to promote [[open access]] to scholarly literature and re-use of research data, and has appointed the ex-''Rector Magnificus'', Karel Luyben, (President, or in the UK also Vice-Chancellor) of the [[Delft University of Technology]] in The [[Netherlands]] as ''National Coordinator Open Science''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tuin |first1=Crystel |title=Karel Luyben is nationaal coördinator Open Science |url=https://www.computable.nl/artikel/nieuws/onderwijs/6298322/250449/karel-luyben-is-nationaal-coordinator-open-science.html |accessdate=10 November 2018 |work=www.computable.nl |date=9 February 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation aims furthermore to reform the manner in which researchers are assessed in such a way that the assessment actually stimulates open science. 

NPOS notes a lack of openness in the scientific culture demonstrated, for instance, by published [[research article|articles]] describing research paid for by [[public funds]] and of interest to a wide audience habitually being behind [[paywalls]], or access to them being otherwise encumbered. In addition to that, the [[publish or perish]] culture prevalent in science incentivises researchers to publish, as much as possible, in journals with a high [[Citation index|citation score]]. And finally, the organisation is drawing attention to the lack of research data stewardship, as a result of which valuable data sets regularly are being lost, research cannot be replicated, or experiments need to be carried out again without the benefit of being able to use what has been done before.
[[File:Open-access.png|thumb]]

== Background ==
The ideal of [[open access]] to scientific research results is a worldwide ambition in the scientific world and has been around for a few decades, but progress is considered too slow, as the [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]] was already launched in 2001 followed, in 2003, by the [[Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing]] and subsequently by a whole series of other, similar, declarations. The issue is gradually reaching the agendas of government policy in countries, states, and supra-national organisations such as the [[EU]], and in 2013 this was the case in The Netherlands, where the government declared that [[open access]] to published results must be the standard for scientific research carried out in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archief06.archiefweb.eu/archives/archiefweb/20171217045100/https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/binaries/rijksoverheid/documenten/kamerstukken/2013/11/15/kamerbrief-over-open-access-van-publicaties/open-access-1.pdf] Letter to Parliament on open access to publications (2016) {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, during its stint as EU chair, the Dutch government organised a conference on open science, upon which a report was published entitled ''Amsterdam Call for Action on Open Science.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.government.nl/documents/reports/2016/04/04/amsterdam-call-for-action-on-open-science 'Amsterdam Call for Action on Open Science'], (2016) (in English)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''national sports team''' (commonly known as a '''national team''' or a '''national side''') is a [[team]] that represents a [[nation]], rather than a particular [[Sports club|club]] or region, in an [[international sport]].

The term is most commonly associated with [[team sport]]s. However, it can be applied to groups of individuals representing a country where regular play is done by individuals, and individual scores are aggregated to a get a team result.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}

National teams often compete at various levels and age groups, and have a number of different selection criteria.  National teams are not always composed of the best available individual players.

National teams, like other sporting teams, are often grouped by sex, age or other criteria.  The most prestigious national teams are often the senior men's and women's teams. However, they may not be the most popular or successful.

In most cases, a national sports team represents a single [[sovereign state]]. In several sports, the [[British Isles]] divides along internal boundaries: [[England]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] are represented by separate national teams, while in the [[Olympic Games]] they combine to form a [[Great Britain at the Olympics|Great Britain]] team. The [[Ireland national rugby union team]] represents the [[Republic of Ireland]] and Northern Ireland in rugby union, and all-island teams are fielded in a number of other sports. Some Olympic teams represent [[Dependent territory|dependent territories]], including [[Bermuda at the Olympics|Bermuda]], the [[British Virgin Islands at the Olympics|British Virgin Islands]] and the [[Cook Islands at the Olympics|Cook Islands]]. The Iroquois Nationals (men) and Haudenosaunee Nationals (women) lacrosse teams of the [[First Nations Lacrosse Association]] are the only teams representing any group of  [[Indigenous people of the Americas]] that plays in an international level.

==Popularity and notability==
The popularity and notability of a national team depend on a number of factors.

===Popularity and participation===
Popularity of a national team also depends on the popularity of the sport in that country. In some countries a particular sport is very popular and may be a [[national sport]]. A national team may be popular even though the competition it competes in is not. For example, the [[Papua New Guinea national rugby league team]] is extremely popular because the sport is popular in the country, even though the highest competition it competes in - the [[Rugby League World Cup]] - is not. In that case, one can see that, even though the sport is popular in that country, the general level they are playing is not so high or lower than other countries that they want to compete with. For example, even if the Korean national handball league team is not so popular because handball is not a popular sport in Korea, they sometimes get gold medals in Olympics or World Cup Games. In this case, the game they participate in may become more popular and influence its popularity. 

====Demographics====
A particular sport in a country may be more popular among certain groups.  For example, a women's team may be more popular than a men's team if there is a greater participation in the sport.

===Popularity of the competition===
The popularity of the international competition that a team participates in has the biggest influence on the popularity of national sports team.  There is a certain amount of prestige which is associated with competing on the "world stage".

Competitions with the most teams involved offer the most international competition and are often most popular.  The most popular multi-sport international competitions that include team sports include the [[Olympic Games]], [[Commonwealth Games]] are relatively open for participation.  Other competitions that are specific to sports, such as the [[FIFA World Cup]] ([[Association football]]), [[Rugby World Cup]] (rugby union) and [[Cricket World Cup]] ([[cricket]]) allow many countries to qualify. For instance, the popularity of the [[Australia national soccer team|Socceroos]] is heightened during the FIFA World Cup simply due to participation in a global event.

However, how even the competition is also matters.  Even if there are a large number of participants, if a handful of teams dominate or if many of the teams are from countries where the sport lack sufficient depth to field a quality side, then the overall competition will not be taken seriously.

===Competitiveness or success of a team===
Popularity of a national team can also be due to a team being successful even if the sport itself is not popular in a country.

===Strength of domestic competition===
In many countries, the national team is the highest level of play available and as a result, it is often most popular with fans and spectators from that country.

In other countries, domestic competitions may be more competitive and offer a higher standard of play and reward.

==Individual selection and participation==
Depending on the sport, nation, and era in question, membership on the national team maybe earned through individual play (as is the case for an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] athletics team or a [[Davis Cup]] team), players may be selected by a managers and coaches appointed by a [[Sport governing body|national sport association]], or a team may have to win a national championship in order to receive the right to represent their nation (as in the [[World Curling Championships]]).

===Eligibility===
Various rules are used to determine who is eligible to play for which national team.

====[[Association football]]====
Under [[FIFA]] regulations, a player primarily qualifies for a national team by "holding a permanent nationality that is not dependent on residence in a certain country"—i.e., being a passport-carrying citizen of said country.&lt;ref name="FIFA Reg III 5.1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resources.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/02/78/29/07/fifastatutsweben_neutral.pdf |title=Regulation III, Article 5: Principle |work=FIFA Statutes |publisher=FIFA |page=70 |date=April 2016 |accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a player's single nationality enables him or her to play for more than one FIFA member, any of the following will be sufficient to establish eligibility for a specific association under that nationality:&lt;ref name="FIFA Reg III 6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resources.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/02/78/29/07/fifastatutsweben_neutral.pdf |title=Regulation III, Article 6: Nationality entitling players to represent more than one association |work=FIFA Statutes |publisher=FIFA |page=70 |date=April 2016 |accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Birth "on the territory governed by the relevant association."
# The birth of a biological parent or [[Grandfather rule|grandparent]] in said territory.
# Two years of continuous residence in said territory at the time of his or her first appearance.

However, FIFA allows associations that share a common nationality to make an agreement among themselves, subject to FIFA approval, by which the residency criterion is deleted completely or amended to require a longer time limit.&lt;ref name="FIFA Reg III 6"/&gt; The most notable example of this situation is the [[United Kingdom]], which has four national associations on its territory ([[The Football Association|England]], [[Irish Football Association|Northern Ireland]], [[Scottish Football Association|Scotland]], [[Football Association of Wales|Wales]]).

Players become permanently tied to a national association, with one exception to be outlined below, once they play in "an official competition of any category or any type of football". This includes any competition for national teams governed by FIFA, including qualifying matches for said competitions; [[Friendly match|international friendlies]] cannot tie players to a country under any circumstances.&lt;ref name="FIFA Reg III 5.1"/&gt;

Players who have more than one nationality, regardless of the method of acquisition, have slightly different eligibility requirements from those who have a single nationality, whether or not it is shared by multiple associations. In addition to holding the relevant nationality, any of the following will qualify a player to appear for said country:&lt;ref name="FIFA Reg III 7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resources.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/02/78/29/07/fifastatutsweben_neutral.pdf |title=Regulation III, Article 7: Acquisition of a new nationality |work=FIFA Statutes |publisher=FIFA |page=71 |date=April 2016 |accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Daniel|title=Football, cricket, rugby league and rugby union - how England's teams compare for foreign-born talent|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/10368933/Football-cricket-rugby-league-and-rugby-union-how-Englands-teams-compare-for-foreign-born-talent.html|accessdate=7 June 2014|work=Daily Telegraph|date=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Birth in that country.
# Birth of a biological parent or grandparent in that country.
# Five years of residence in that country after turning age 18.

This last rule is intended to prevent associations from naturalising players who lack birth or familial ties in that country, and immediately fielding them in international matches. FIFA will issue waivers to this last requirement if an association can show to FIFA's satisfaction that the player had significant ties to that country prior to naturalisation. A recent example of such a waiver is that of [[Gedion Zelalem]], a German-born player of Ethiopian descent who currently represents the U.S. at under-23 level. He emigrated with his father to the U.S. at age 9 in 2006, and left the country at age 16 to join [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal's]] youth academy. In 2014, he automatically became a U.S. citizen [[Child Citizenship Act of 2000|outside the normal naturalisation process]] when his father became a U.S. citizen, and the [[United States Soccer Federation]] applied for a waiver of the adult residency requirement, citing Zelalem's extended childhood residence in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gedion Zelalem currently ineligible but United States can get FIFA exception|url=http://www.espnfc.com/united-states/story/2268050/united-states-needs-fifa-exception-for-ineligible-gedion-zelalem-of-arsenal|website=ESPNFC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was approved to play for the U.S. several months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gedion Zelalem makes U.S. debut in under-20 friendly|url=http://www.espnfc.us/united-states/story/2457677/gedion-zelalem-makes-us-debut-in-under-20-friendly|website=ESPNFC |date=May 19, 2015|accessdate=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate from the above rules, a player who holds multiple nationalities may petition FIFA for a one-time change of nationality if he or she has never appeared in an official ''senior'' international match for any country, and holds the nationality of the second country prior to appearing for said country.&lt;ref name="FIFA Reg III 8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resources.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/02/78/29/07/fifastatutsweben_neutral.pdf |title=Regulation III, Article 8: Change of association |work=FIFA Statutes |publisher=FIFA |page=71 |date=April 2016 |accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aforementioned Zelalem case falls within the scope of these rules, since he had played for Germany at youth level.

====[[Basketball]]====
[[FIBA]]'s national team eligibility rules are broadly similar to those of FIFA. Holding nationality is mandatory (but not sufficient) for eligibility to represent a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/internal-regulations/book3/players-and-officials.pdf |title=Article 3-15: National Status of Players |work=FIBA Internal Regulations, Book 3: Players and Officials |publisher=FIBA |date=17 June 2018 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players with multiple nationalities may choose to play for of one of those countries at any age by making a written request to FIBA. However, if the player has yet to make a choice and one of those countries formally calls the player to international duty after he or she reaches age 18, that player is required to make a choice at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/internal-regulations/book3/players-and-officials.pdf |title=Article 3-17: National Status of Players |work=FIBA Internal Regulations, Book 3: Players and Officials |publisher=FIBA |date=17 June 2018 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in association football, playing in an international friendly cannot tie a player to any country; only participation in an official FIBA competition is sufficient for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/internal-regulations/book3/players-and-officials.pdf |title=Article 3-18: National Status of Players |work=FIBA Internal Regulations, Book 3: Players and Officials |publisher=FIBA |date=17 June 2018 |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike association football, FIBA does not have a "grandparent rule" for most players. The method by which a player obtains citizenship is irrelevant to national team eligibility, as long as it has been legally acquired. The only use of the grandparent rule is to determine a player's eligibility to represent the national team of a country's dependent territory, with two notable examples being those of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]], both [[United States|US]] [[insular area]]s with their own national federations, and whose native-born residents are US citizens by birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/internal-regulations/book3/players-and-officials.pdf |title=Article 3-26: National Status of Players |work=FIBA Internal Regulations, Book 3: Players and Officials |publisher=FIBA |date=17 June 2018 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the method by which a player becomes a citizen does not affect his or her eligibility for a national team, it can affect the player's ability to participate in a given FIBA competition. FIBA mandates that in official competitions, no national team can have more than one player on its roster who acquired citizenship by any means after reaching age 16. This also applies to individuals who had the right to a second nationality at birth (such as individuals born in [[Northern Ireland]], who are generally born with [[British nationality law|UK citizenship]] but also [[Irish nationality law|have the right]] to citizenship in the [[Republic of Ireland]] from birth), but did not exercise that right until age 16 or later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/internal-regulations/book3/players-and-officials.pdf |title=Article 3-21: National Status of Players |work=FIBA Internal Regulations, Book 3: Players and Officials |publisher=FIBA |date=17 June 2018 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[Rugby union]]====
Unlike the situation in association football and basketball, in which holding nationality in a country is a requirement for representing that country, eligibility regulations in rugby union do not mention nationality at all. Players can qualify for a given country in one of four ways:&lt;ref name="WR Reg 8"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulation 8. Eligibility to play for national representative teams|url=https://www.worldrugby.org/handbook/regulations/reg-8/reg-8 |publisher=World Rugby |accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Birth in the country.
# Having a parent or grandparent born in that country. Note that unlike FIFA, which defines "parent" and "grandparent" to include only blood relations, World Rugby replaces blood relations with adoptive relations if the player has been legally adopted under the laws of the relevant country. This replacement also applies if the player was not adopted, but one or both of the birth parents had been adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldrugby.org/handbook/regulations/reg-8/explanatory-guidelines |title=Regulation 8 Explanatory Guidelines |publisher=World Rugby |date=21 April 2016 |accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Residing in the country for a set period of time prior to their first appearance for that country. Currently, the required period is three years, but it will change to five years effective 31 December 2020. This means that any player who moved to a new country after 31 December 2017, and cannot qualify by another method, is subject to the new five-year rule.
# Completion of 10 years of cumulative residency in the country, regardless of whether any of the other criteria have been met. This particular criterion went into effect in May 2017.&lt;ref name="Rugby World"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyworld.com/news/rugbys-international-eligibility-rules-90995 |title=What are rugby’s international eligibility rules? |publisher=''[[Rugby World]]'' |date=29 March 2018 |accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
This does not prevent a national union from requiring that its representative players hold that country's nationality. For example, since December 2016, the [[French Rugby Federation]] has required French nationality as a precondition for national team selection, with players who had represented France before the policy change exempt from said requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/38389827 |title=France rugby team to stop selecting 'foreign' players, says Laporte |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 December 2016 |accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally, if a player has ever played for one national team then he or she may not play for the team of a different nation at same or at the next-higher level of seniority. However, the addition of  rugby sevens to the [[Rugby sevens at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]] created a loophole due to the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC's]] different eligibility criteria. Players who have been "captured" by one country but hold the passport of another country can make a one-time change of allegiance to the second country under the following conditions:&lt;ref name="Rugby World"/&gt;
* The player has not represented the capturing country for three years at the time of his or her first appearance for the second country. Special rules in place only for the 2016 Olympic qualifying process shortened this period to 18 months.
* The player represents his or her new country in four Olympic qualifying events. This includes events in the [[World Rugby Sevens Series]] for men and [[World Rugby Women's Sevens Series]] in seasons immediately preceding the Summer Olympics, which double as Olympic qualifiers, plus regional Olympic qualifying tournaments.

As for the concept of "capturing"—i.e., being tied to a specific country—the criteria have evolved over the years. Under current World Rugby regulations, a player is captured once he or she plays for one of three specific teams:&lt;ref name="WR Reg 8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rugby World"/&gt;
# A union's 15-a-side senior national team.
# A union's "next senior" 15-a-side national team. Each union may, but is not required to, designate one of its teams as the "next senior" team. This side is usually designated as an "A" national team, though a number of nations have special brand names for their "next senior" side, such as [[Argentina XV national rugby union team|Argentina XV]], [[England Saxons]], [[Ireland Wolfhounds]], or [[Junior All Blacks]] (New Zealand). Notably, many unions have not designated a "next senior" women's team. Prior to 1 January 2018, a union could designate its under-20 national side as its "next senior" team, but this is no longer allowed.
# A union's senior national sevens team. However, no player can be captured by playing on a senior sevens team before turning 18 under any circumstances, and cannot be captured in this manner prior to age 20 unless the player participates in the Olympics or Rugby World Cup Sevens after turning 18.

Note that unlike association football or basketball, players can be captured by appearing in international friendlies, such as the traditional mid-year and end-of-year Tests.

However, capture only occurs ''when the opponent is also one of the above-mentioned sides''. This can sometimes cause apparently counterintuitive results. For example, [[Michael Haley (rugby union)|Mike Haley]] has represented England twice—first for England Saxons against [[South Africa A national rugby union team|South Africa A]] in 2016, and then for a non-capped England XV against the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]] in 2017. However, neither match tied him to England, and he remains eligible for selection to [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], for which he qualifies by ancestry. Even though the 2016 match involved two national "A" sides, it did not qualify to capture Haley (or any other player on either team who had not previously been captured) because at the time, [[South African Rugby Union|South Africa's]] designated "next senior" side was [[South Africa national under-20 rugby union team|its U-20 national team]]. As for the 2017 match, WR classifies the Barbarians as a club team, putting them outside the scope of this regulation.&lt;ref name="Rugby World"/&gt;

Various controversies have involved the participation of players whose eligibility has been challenged. One famous example was [[Grannygate]]. More recently, questions have been raised about the eligibility of two players who participated in the European qualifying process for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, one for Belgium and the other for Romania.&lt;ref name="Rugby World"/&gt;

===Professionalism vs. amateurism===
In some national teams representatives play for the love of their sport and country.  However, in others, individual players are paid to represent their country.

In some cases, players are either deliberately excluded or choose not to represent their national team on the basis of not being remunerated. This can affect the relative performance of a team.  For instance, after allowing professional players, the [[USA men's national basketball team]] dramatically jumped up the world rankings.

In other cases, players may be contracted to a club, at home or abroad. As a result, their primary loyalty may be to their club rather than their country, especially if the competition that the national team is playing in does not offer the same prestige.

===Controversy===
{{see also|Olympic Games#Amateurism and professionalism}}
[[Eastern bloc]] countries were notorious for skirting the edge of the rules by having state-sponsored "full-time amateurs". Their Olympic athletes were given everything they needed to live and train, but were not technically paid to do it, and all the money came from the government.

The '''Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation''' ('''Ofqual''') is a [[non-ministerial government department]] that regulates qualifications, exams and tests in England and, until May 2016, vocational qualifications in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-qualifications-and-examinations-regulation Gov.uk], Gov.UK Government, Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation, Retrieved 6 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NI changes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/changes-to-qualifications-regulation-in-northern-ireland|title=Changes to qualifications regulation in Northern Ireland|date =5 May 2016|publisher=Ofqual|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colloquially and publicly, Ofqual is often referred to as the exam "watchdog".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-28581885&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
Ofqual's role is ''to maintain standards and confidence in qualifications.''&lt;ref name="about us"&gt;
{{cite web|

title=About us|
publisher=Ofqual}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Area of governance===
It regulates exams, qualifications and tests in England. Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland are regulated by each respective national government. However, the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]] SQA is also accredited by Ofqual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/37893.2080.html|title=Ofqual External Verification|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126012725/http://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/37893.2080.html|archivedate=26 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ofqual collaborates closely with the UK government and the Department for Education on general qualifications, such as GCSEs and A levels, and with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills on vocational qualifications such as NVQs and BTECs. In Northern Ireland it regulated [[National Vocational Qualification|NVQ]]s on behalf of the [[Department for Employment and Learning]] until May 2016; this responsibility has since been handed to the [[Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment]].&lt;ref name="NI changes"/&gt; Ofqual is the authority which regulates and accredits British examination boards offering GCSEs and GCE A levels while it is the [[Joint Council for Qualifications|JCQ]] which regulates administration of actual GCSE and A Level examinations.

===Modular vs. linear controversy===

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under [[Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] initiated reforms for A Levels to change from the current modular to a linear structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gov.uk/nctl/examsadmin/news/archive/a00217355/alevels|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140430095946/http://www.education.gov.uk/nctl/examsadmin/news/archive/a00217355/alevels|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 April 2014|title=Changes to A levels - The Department for Education|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; British Examination Boards ([[Edexcel]], [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|AQA]] and [[Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations|OCR]]) regulated and accredited by Ofqual responded to the government's reform announcements by modifying [[syllabi]] of several A Level subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edexcel.com/quals/gce/gce15/Pages/default.aspx|title=Edexcel A levels|publisher=|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/gcses-as-and-a-levels-new-subjects-to-be-taught-in-2016|title=GCSEs, AS and A levels: new subjects to be taught in 2016|publisher=|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and in particular the [[Member of Parliament]] [[Tristram Hunt]] announced that it will halt and reverse the reforms and maintain the modular A-Level system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachingtimes.com/news/a-level-reforms.htm|title=Labour pledges to halt A-Level reforms|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge have expressed support for the modular system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/education-24533511|title=Oxford raises concerns over A-level exam reform|work=BBC News|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10584709/A-level-reforms-will-harm-English-pupils-says-Cambridge.html|title=A-level reforms 'will harm English pupils', says Cambridge|date=20 January 2014|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent reports reveal that the linear examination approach and the toughening educational reforms initiated by Ofqual provoked many schools to "play the system" by enquiring test remarking and supplementary aid for students (e.g. special consideration and extra time) in order to uphold high exam grade levels so as to not drop in league tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11290157/Ofqual-schools-playing-the-system-to-boost-pupils-grades.html|title=Ofqual: schools playing the system to boost pupils' grades|date=12 December 2014|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rising numbers of students taking GCSEs and GCE A Levels over the past decades has led to an increase in the quantity of examination results being enquired for re-marking and reported to Ofqual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academiesweek.co.uk/gcse-and-a-level-exam-enquiries-have-exceeded-450000-say-ofqual/|title=GCSE and A level exam enquiries have exceeded 450,000 say Ofqual|publisher=|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ofqual's remit and responsibilities are established in law by the [[Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2009/ukpga_20090022_en_1
|title=Apprenticeship, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009
|date=12 November 2009
|publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]]
|accessdate=1 December 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Education Act 2011]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/21/contents/enacted
|title=Education Act 2011
|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Non-ministerial department]] Ofqual is accountable to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], through the [[Education Select Committee]]. It is not accountable to Government ministers and as such is independent from Ministerial Government. Whereas Ofqual regulates and accredits British examination boards (e.g. [[Edexcel]], [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|AQA]], [[Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations|OCR]] etc.) and their GCSE and GCE A-Level specifications; the examination board CIE ([[Cambridge International Examinations]]) which offers international GCSEs and GCE A-Levels predominantly for schools outside the United Kingdom operates independently without British governmental intervention. Therefore, although CIE qualifications are accredited by Ofqual, they are not regulated by it and thus may differ significantly in subject content and exam structure from UK GCSEs and GCE A-Levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ask.cie.org.uk/system/selfservice.controller?CONFIGURATION=1035&amp;PARTITION_ID=1&amp;TIMEZONE_OFFSET=&amp;USERTYPE=&amp;CMD=VIEW_ARTICLE&amp;ARTICLE_ID=5413 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113170118/http://ask.cie.org.uk/system/selfservice.controller?CONFIGURATION=1035&amp;PARTITION_ID=1&amp;TIMEZONE_OFFSET=&amp;USERTYPE=&amp;CMD=VIEW_ARTICLE&amp;ARTICLE_ID=5413 |archivedate=13 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

Ofqual's Chair is Roger Taylor, who was appointed in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roger Taylor - GOV.uk|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/people/roger-taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sally Collier was appointed Chief Regulator and CEO from April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sally Collier named as Ofqual’s new chief regulator|url=http://schoolsweek.co.uk/preferred-candidate-for-ofquals-chief-regulator-revealed/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other members of the Board include Professor Julius Weinberg and Dr. Mike Cresswell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ofqual.gov.uk/about-us/our-board/|title=Our Board|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has four directorates:
* Strategy, risk and research
* Vocational and technical qualifications
* General qualifications
* Regulatory and corporate services

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4266">'''Paul Draper''' (born 1957) is an American philosopher, most known for his work in the [[philosophy of religion]]. His work on the [[evidential argument from evil]] has been widely influential. He is currently a professor at [[Purdue University]]. He is co-editor of topics in the philosophy of religion for the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/board.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He studied at the [[University of California]], graduating B.A. in 1979, M.A. in 1982 and Ph.D. in 1985. He taught philosophy at [[Florida International University]] between 1987 and 2006, when he moved to [[Purdue University]].&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;[http://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/phil/links/draper_cv.doc.pdf CV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727103817/http://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/phil/links/draper_cv.doc.pdf |date=2010-07-27 }}, Purdue University site.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Draper was editor of the [[academic journal]] ''[[Philo (journal)|Philo]]'' from 2007 to 2012. His philosophical inquiry is focused on issues in the [[philosophy of religion]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Paul Draper, Professor |work=Philosopher Compass |publisher=Blackwell publishing |url=http://www.blackwell-compass.com/subject/philosophy/profile?person=DraperPaul |accessdate=2007-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; he has written extensively on the [[problem of evil]], including the argument that the process of [[natural selection]] is sufficiently brutal so as to pose a problem for those who believe in an [[omnipotent]] and morally good creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Draper |title=Natural Selection and the Problem of Evil |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/paul_draper/evil.html |work=The Great Debate |publisher=Internet Infidels |accessdate=2007-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, he debated Christian apologist [[William Lane Craig]] over the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9F4m_JZBdY The Existence of God: William Lane Craig vs Paul Draper] U.S. Military Academy at West Point. September 30, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; He has edited a debate collection called ''God or Blind Nature? Philosophers Debate the Evidence'', released as an e-book in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Paul Draper (editor) |title=God or Blind Nature? Philosophers Debate the Evidence |publisher=Internet Infidels |accessdate=2007-10-10 |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/debates/great-debate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of Draper's influential and widely reprinted papers is "Pain and Pleasure: An Evidential Problem for Theists",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jeffrey Jay |last=Lowder |title=The Biological Role of Pain and Pleasure |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/nontheism/atheism/pain-and-pleasure.html |publisher=Internet infidels |accessdate=2007-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the journal ''[[Noûs]]'' in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Draper |title=Pain and Pleasure: An Evidential Problem for Theists |journal=Noûs |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=331–350 |date=June 1989 |doi=10.2307/2215486 |jstor=2215486}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Draper proposes a modification and extension of the "problem of evil" argument. Instead of claiming that the existence of evil logically contradicts [[theism]], he argues that the "hypothesis of indifference", which holds that should supernatural beings exist, they are indifferent to our suffering, better explains the existence of suffering. Since the hypothesis of indifference is logically incompatible with theism, he considers this an evidentiary problem for theism. The paper relies significantly on the use of [[epistemic]] probabilities, equivalent to those used in [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian reasoning]]. He is also responsible for first coining the term "[[skeptical theism]]."

'''Performance studies''' is an interdisciplinary field that studies [[Performance (disambiguation)|performance]] and uses performance as a lens to study the world. The term 'performance' is broad, and can include artistic and aesthetic performances like concerts, theatrical events, and [[performance art]]; sporting events; social, political and religious events like rituals, ceremonies, proclamations and public decisions; certain kinds of language use; and those components of identity which require someone to do, rather than just be, something. Consequently, performance studies is interdisciplinary, drawing from theories of the performing arts, anthropology and sociology, literary theory, and legal studies.

Performance Studies has been challenged as an emerging discipline. Many academics have been critical of its instability. As an academic field it is difficult to pin down; either that is the nature of the field itself or it is still too young to tell. There are, however, numerous degree-granting programs that train researchers being offered by universities. Some have referred to it as an "inter discipline" or a "post discipline".&lt;ref&gt;Schechner, Richard. "Foreword: Fundamentals of Performance Studies," Nathan Stucky and Cynthia Wimmer, eds., ''Teaching Performance Studies,'' Southern Illinois University Press, 2002. P.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance Studies tends to concentrate on a mix of research methods. The application of practice-led or practice-based research methods has become a widespread phenomenon not just in the anglophone world. As such research projects integrate established methods like literature research and oral history with performance practice, i.e. artistic autoethnographic approaches and verbatim theatre. The documentation of ''Practice-as-Research in Performance'' (PARIP), a devoted research project conducted at the University of Bristol between 2001 and 2006, offers a number of inspiring articles and portraits of such research projects and was key for a breakthrough of using creative thinking within this subject field.&lt;ref&gt;Allegue, L., Jones, S., Kershaw, B., &amp; Piccini, A. (2009). Practice-as-Research in performance and screen. Basingstoke.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and basic concepts==

Richard Schechner author of ''Performance Studies: An Introduction'' states that Performance studies examine performances in two categories: Artistic and Cultural Performances. A. Artistic Performance are marked and understood as art. solo-performance, performance art, performance of literature, theatrical storytelling, plays, and performance poetry, This category considers performance as the art form. B. Cultural Performance includes events that occur in everyday life in which a culture values are displayed for their perpetuation: rituals such as parades, religious ceremonies, community festivals, controversial storytelling, and performances of social and professional roles, and individual performances of race, gender, sexuality and class. 

===Theatre and anthropology===
Performance Studies as an academic field has multiple origin narratives. On the theatrical and anthropological front, this origin is often regarded as the research collaborations of director [[Richard Schechner]] and anthropologist [[Victor Turner]]. This origin narrative emphasizes a definition of performance as being "between theatre and anthropology" and often stresses the importance of [[intercultural]] performances as an alternative to either traditional proscenium theatre or traditional anthropological fieldwork. [[Dwight Conquergood]] developed a branch of performance ethnography that centered the political nature of the practice and advocated for methodological dialogism from the point of encounter to the practices of research reporting. [[Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett]] has contributed an interest in tourist productions and ethnographic showmanship to the field, Judd Case has adapted performance to the study of media and religion,&lt;ref&gt;Case, J. A. "Sounds from the Center: Liriel's Performance and Ritual Pilgrimage" ''Journal of Media &amp; Religion'', October 2009, 209–225.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diana Taylor (professor)|Diana Taylor]] has brought a hemispheric perspective on Latin American performance and theorized the relationship between the [[archive]] and the performance repertoire, while Corinne Kratz developed a mode of performance analysis that emphasizes the role of multimedia communication in performance.&lt;ref&gt;Kratz, Corinne A. ''Affecting Performance: Meaning, Movement and Experience in Okiek Women's Initiation'', Smithsonian Institution Press, 1994 (new edition, Wheatmark 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Laurie Frederik argues for the importance of ethnographic research and a solid theoretical base in anthropological perspective.

===Literature===
On the literature front, Wallace Bacon (1914–2001), considered by many to be the father of performance theory, taught the performance of literature as the ultimate act of humility. In his defining statement of performance theory, "Our center is in the interaction between readers and texts which enriches, extends, clarifies, and (yes) alters the interior and even the exterior lives of students [and performers and audiences] through the power of texts" (''Literature in Performance'', Vol 5 No 1, 1984; p.&amp;nbsp;84). In addition, Robert Breen's text ''[[Chamber theatre|Chamber Theatre]]'' is a cornerstone in the field for staging narrative texts, though it remains controversial in its assertions about the place of narrative details in chamber productions. Breen is also regarded by many as a founding theorist for the discipline, along with advocate Louise Rosenblatt. More recently, performance theorist and novelist [[Barbara Browning]] has suggested that narrative fiction itself—and particularly the novel—demands the performative participation of the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Browning|first1=Barbara|title='Dear Reader': The Novel's Call to Perform|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1m4uWyRjvo|website=YouTube|publisher=The Book Lovers|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speech-act theory and 'performatives'===
An alternative origin narrative stresses the development of [[J.L. Austin|speech-act theory]] by philosophers [[J.L. Austin]] and [[Judith Butler]], literary critic [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]], and also [[Shoshana Felman]]. The theory proposed by Austin in ''How To Do Things With Words''  states that "to say something ''is to do something'', or ''in'' saying something we do something, and even ''by'' saying something we do something".&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. ''How To Do Things With Words''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1962. P. 94&lt;/ref&gt; the most illustrative example being "I do", as part of a marriage ceremony. For any of these performative utterances to be felicitous, per Austin, they must be true, appropriate and conventional according to those with the proper authority: a priest, a judge, or the scholar, for instance. Austin accounts for the infelicitous by noting that "there will always occur difficult or marginal cases where nothing in the previous history of a conventional procedure will decide conclusively whether such a procedure is or is not correctly applied to such a case".&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. ''How To Do Things With Words''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1962. P. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of failure in performatives (utterances made with language and the body) is taken up by Butler and is understood as the "political promise of the performative".&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith. ''[[Excitable Speech : A Politics of the Performative]].'' New York: Routledge, 1997 P. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Her argument is that because the performative needs to maintain conventional power, convention itself has to be reiterated, and in this reiteration it can be expropriated by the unauthorized usage and thus create new futures. She cites Rosa Parks as an example:&lt;blockquote&gt;
When [[Rosa Parks]] sat in the front of the bus, she had no prior right to do so guaranteed by any…conventions of the South. And yet, in laying claim to the right for which she had no prior authorization, she endowed a certain authority on the act, and began the insurrectionary process of overthrowing those established codes of legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;''Excitable Speech : A Politics of the Performative.'' New York: Routledge, 1997 P. 147&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The question of the infelicitous  utterance (the misfire)is also taken up by Shoshana Felman when she states "Infelicity, or failure, is not for Austin an accident of the performative, it is inherent in it, essential to it. In other words…Austin conceives of failure not as external but as internal to the promise, as what actually constitutes it."&lt;ref&gt;Felman, Shoshana ''Scandal of the Speaking Body: Don Juan with J.L. Austin, or Seduction in Two Languages'' P. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance studies has also had a strong relationship to the fields of feminism, [[psychoanalysis]], critical race theory and [[queer theory]]. Theorists like [[Peggy Phelan]],&lt;ref&gt;Phelan, Peggy. ''Unmarked: The Politics of Performance''. London; New York: Routledge, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; [[José Esteban Muñoz]],&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz, José Esteban. ''Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics''. University of Minnesota Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. Patrick Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;E. Patrick Johnson. Appropriating Blackness: Performance and the Politics of Authenticity. Duke University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Rebecca Schneider,&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Rebecca. ''The Explicit Body in Performance''. London ; New York: Routledge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[André Lepecki]] have been equally influential in both performance studies and these related fields.

==Academic programs==
Performance studies incorporates theories of [[drama]], [[dance]], [[art]], [[anthropology]], [[folkloristics]], [[philosophy]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[comparative literature]], [[communication studies]], and increasingly, music performance.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g.
Nicholas Cook and Richard Pettengill (eds.), "Taking It to the Bridge. Music as Performance", University of Michigan Press, 2013; Nicholas Cook, "Between Process and Product: Music and/as Performance", in: [http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.01.7.2/mto.01.7.2.cook.html "The Online Journal of the Society for Music Theory", Vol. 7, No. 2, April 2001]; Philip Auslander, "Music as Performance: Living in the Immaterial World," in: [http://lmc.gatech.edu/~auslander/publications/Auslander-Immaterial.pdf "Theatre Survey", Vol. 47, No. 4, Fall 2006]"; Melanie Fritsch and Stefan Strötgen, "Relatively Live: How to Identify Live Music Performances", in: [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.5406/musimoviimag.5.1.0047?uid=3737864&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103032208791 "Music and the Moving Image", Vol. 5 No. 1, 2012 (March), p. 47–66.]&lt;/ref&gt; More can be found out by reading Schechner's book: ''Performance Studies: An Introduction'' or in D. Soyini Madison and Judith Hamera's The Sage Handbook for Performance Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, D. Soyini and Judith Hamera, eds. The Sage Handbook for Performance Studies. SAGE 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The first performance studies department was created at [[New York University|NYU]]. However, there is some debate that the joint-cradles of Performance Studies are [[Northwestern University]] and NYU. For more information on the different origins and disciplinary traditions of performance studies see Shannon Jackson's book ''Professing Performance'' and the introductory chapter in Nathan Stucky and Cynthia Wimmer's ''Teaching Performance Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky, Nathan and Cynthia Wimmer, eds. ''Teaching Performance Studies.'' Southern Illinois University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the differences between the NYU and Northwestern models cite different disciplinary concerns. NYU is generally characterized as a program that pushed the definitions of theatrical practice influenced by the thearical avant-garde thus expanding its definition of what can be framed as an event. Interaction with departments that include [[New York University|NYU]]'s Postdoctoral Program in Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy have made this an ongoing pursuit. Northwestern transitioned from an elocution and performance of literature tradition to expand its definition of presentational aesthetics beyond oral interpretation. Northwestern's unique brand of performance studies has its origins in [[anthropology]], having been started by the ethnographer [[Dwight Conquergood]] with the goal of understanding all manner of local cultures through their performance practices. In both instances a focus on practice lead to a research methodology beyond theatre or literature/speech. In the United States, the interdisciplinary and multi-focus field has spread to [[Brown University|Brown]], [[University of California at Los Angeles|UCLA]], University of Northern Iowa, [[University of California at Irvine|UCI]],  [[University of California at Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], and elsewhere. Undergraduate and graduate programs are offered at [http://www.utexas.edu/finearts/tad/graduate-programs/performance-public-practice The University of Texas at Austin], [[University of California at Los Angeles|UCLA]]'s [http://www.wacd.ucla.edu/ Culture and Performance Program], [http://performancestudies.ucdavis.edu/ UC Davis], [http://drama.arts.uci.edu/graduate-programs/phd/phd-program/ UC Irvine], [[Kennesaw State University]], [[Louisiana State University]], [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]], [[California State University, Northridge]], [[San Jose State University]], [[University of San Diego]], [[University of Maryland]], the [[University of North Carolina Chapel Hill]], and [https://pad.artsci.wustl.edu/amprogram Washington University in St. Louis]. [[Texas A&amp;M University]]'s [http://performancestudies.tamu.edu/ Department of Performance Studies] is unique in including both Music and Theatre degree programs.

In the United Kingdom [[Aberystwyth University]] offers a degree scheme in performance studies with highly acclaimed performance artists such as Mike Pearson, Heike Roms and Jill Greenhalgh. The [[University of Roehampton]] in London offers a BA in Drama, Theatre and Performance Studies. [[Richmond University]], London also offers a BA in Performance and Theatre Arts. The University of Plymouth has offered a BA in Theatre &amp; Performance since the early 1990s; its postgraduate research programme (ResM and MPhil/PhD) specialises in performance studies. The [[University of Warwick]] also offers a BA in Theatre and Performance Studies, in addition to leading Postgraduate programmes.

In Denmark [[Roskilde University]] offers a master and ph.d. degree in "performance design", focusing on subjects such as theatrical performances, live music, festivals, and urban performances.

In Germany [[University of Hamburg]] offers a master program in performance studies at the centre for performance studies run by [[Gabriele Klein]]. The Centre for Performance Studies at the [[University of Bremen]] offers a certificate in performance studies focussing on the combination of academic and artistic research within performance projects.

In India, [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]] offers MPhil and PhD program in Theatre &amp; Performance Studies at the School of Arts &amp; Aesthetics. Since 2012, School of Culture and Creative Expressions, [[Ambedkar University Delhi]], started a MA program in Performance Studies, which focus on redefining methodologies of cultural studies and research on the basis of the nuances of performance studies. It is formulating the first Practice based PhD in the country and working extensively in the realm of Practice-as-Research. On the similar lines, the Centre for Performance Research and Cultural Studies in South Asia (CPRACSIS), Kerala have organised series of workshops and seminars over the last few years to engage scholars, artists and practitioners in conversation informed by Performance Studies.

In Australia, the [[University of Sydney]], [[Victoria University, Australia|Victoria University]] and [[Queensland University of Technology]] offer degrees majoring in performance studies, Honours, Masters and Phd. Performance Studies in some countries is also an A-level (AS and A2) course consisting of the integration of the discrete art forms of Dance, Music and Drama in performing arts.

In Brazil, The [[Universidade Federal de Goiás]], started an interdisciplinary program (masters) in Performances Culturais (Cultural Performances) in 2012, the first in a Latin country. The goal of this program is to analyze "rituals, games, performances, drama, dance" from a cross-cultural point of view.

'''Python''' is an [[interpreted language|interpreted]] [[high-level programming language]] for [[general-purpose programming language|general-purpose programming]]. Created by [[Guido van Rossum]] and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes [[code readability]], notably using [[significant whitespace]]. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-7" /&gt; In July 2018, Van Rossum stepped down as the leader in the language community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Guido van Rossum Stepping Down from Role as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life {{!}} Linux Journal |url=https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/guido-van-rossum-stepping-down-role-pythons-benevolent-dictator-life |website=www.linuxjournal.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Python boss Guido van Rossum steps down after 30 years {{!}} TheINQUIRER |url=https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3035842/python-boss-guido-van-rossum-steps-down-after-30-years |website=http://www.theinquirer.net |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Python features a [[dynamic type]] system and automatic [[memory management]]. It supports multiple [[programming paradigm]]s, including [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented]], [[imperative programming|imperative]], [[functional programming|functional]] and [[procedural programming|procedural]], and has a large and comprehensive [[standard library]].&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Need at least one paragraph here on history and development --&gt;
Python interpreters are available for many [[operating system]]s. [[CPython]], the [[reference implementation]] of Python, is [[Open-source software|open source]] software&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.python.org/3/license.html |title=History and License |accessdate=5 December 2016}} "All Python releases are Open Source"&lt;/ref&gt; and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of Python's other implementations. Python and CPython are managed by the non-profit [[Python Software Foundation]].

== History ==
[[File:Guido van Rossum OSCON 2006 cropped.png|thumb|Guido van Rossum OSCON 2006 cropped]]

{{Main article|History of Python}}

Python was conceived in the late 1980s&lt;ref name="venners-interview-pt-1" /&gt; by [[Guido van Rossum]] at [[Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica]] (CWI) in the [[Netherlands]] as a successor to the [[ABC (programming language)|ABC language]] (itself inspired by [[SETL]])&lt;ref name="AutoNT-12" /&gt;, capable of [[exception handling]] and interfacing with the [[Amoeba (operating system)|Amoeba]] operating system.&lt;ref name="faq-created" /&gt; Its implementation began in December 1989.&lt;ref name="timeline-of-python" /&gt; Van Rossum's long influence on Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community: ''[[Benevolent Dictator For Life]]'' (BDFL){{snd}} a post from which he gave himself permanent vacation on July 12, 2018.&lt;ref name="lj-bdfl-resignation" /&gt;

Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features, including a [[Cycle detection|cycle-detecting]] [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collector]] and support for [[Unicode]].&lt;ref name="newin-2.0" /&gt;

Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely [[backward compatibility|backward-compatible]].&lt;ref name="3.0-release" /&gt; Many of its major features were [[backporting|backported]] to Python 2.6.x&lt;ref name="pep-3000" /&gt; and 2.7.x version series.  Releases of Python 3 include the &lt;code&gt;2to3&lt;/code&gt; utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html |title=Automated Python 2 to 3 code translation — Python Documentation |accessdate=11 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Python 2.7's [[end-of-life (product)|end-of-life]] date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/ |title=PEP 373 -- Python 2.7 Release Schedule |work=python.org |accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0466/ |title=PEP 466 -- Network Security Enhancements for Python 2.7.x |work=python.org |accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, Google announced work on a Python 2.7 to [[Go (programming language)|Go]] [[transcompiler]] to improve performance under concurrent workloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/01/grumpy-go-running-python.html |title=Google Open Source Blog: Grumpy: Go running Python! |date=4 January 2017 |accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features and philosophy ==
Python is a [[multi-paradigm programming language]]. [[Object-oriented programming]] and [[structured programming]] are fully supported, and many of its features support [[functional programming]] and [[aspect-oriented programming]] (including by [[metaprogramming]]&lt;ref name="AutoNT-13" /&gt; and [[metaobject]]s (magic methods)).&lt;ref name="AutoNT-14" /&gt; Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including [[design by contract]]&lt;ref name="AutoNT-15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoNT-16" /&gt; and [[logic programming]].&lt;ref name="AutoNT-17" /&gt;

Python uses [[dynamic typing]], and a combination of [[reference counting]] and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for [[memory management]]. It also features dynamic [[Name resolution (programming languages)|name resolution]] ([[late binding]]), which binds method and variable names during program execution.

Python's design offers some support for [[functional programming]] in the [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] tradition. It has &lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;reduce()&lt;/code&gt; functions; [[list comprehension]]s, [[Associative array|dictionaries]], and sets; and [[Generator (computer programming)|generator]] expressions.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-59"/&gt; The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[Standard ML]].&lt;ref name="AutoNT-18" /&gt;

The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document ''The [[Zen of Python]]'' (''PEP 20''), which includes [[aphorism]]s such as:&lt;ref name="PEP20" /&gt;
&lt;!-- Note this isn't a full list, just some of the more significant aphorisms --&gt;
* Beautiful is better than ugly
* Explicit is better than implicit
* Simple is better than complex
* Complex is better than complicated
* Readability counts

Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with [[ABC (programming language)|ABC]], which espoused the opposite approach.&lt;ref name="venners-interview-pt-1" /&gt;

While offering choice in coding methodology, the Python philosophy rejects exuberant syntax (such as that of [[Perl]]) in favor of a simpler, less-cluttered grammar. As [[Alex Martelli]] put it: "To describe something as 'clever' is ''not'' considered a compliment in the Python culture."&lt;ref name="AutoNT-19" /&gt; Python's philosophy rejects the Perl "[[there is more than one way to do it]]" approach to language design in favor of "there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it".&lt;ref name="PEP20" /&gt;

Python's developers strive to avoid [[premature optimization]], and reject patches to non-critical parts of CPython that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-20" /&gt; When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or use [[PyPy]], a [[just-in-time compilation|just-in-time compiler]]. [[Cython]] is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.

An important goal of Python's developers is keeping it fun to use. This is reflected in the language's name—a tribute to the British comedy group [[Monty Python]]&lt;ref name="AutoNT-24"/&gt;—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (from a [[Spam (Monty Python)|famous Monty Python sketch]]) instead of the standard [[Foobar|foo and bar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://insidetech.monster.com/training/articles/8114-15-ways-python-is-a-powerful-force-on-the-web |title=15 Ways Python Is a Powerful Force on the Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.python.org/2/library/pprint.html |title=pprint - Data pretty printer - Python Documentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common [[neologism]] in the Python community is ''pythonic'', which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called ''unpythonic''.

Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as ''Pythonists'', ''Pythonistas'', and ''Pythoneers''.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoNT-25" /&gt;

== Syntax and semantics ==
{{Main article|Python syntax and semantics}}

Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use [[curly bracket programming language|curly brackets]] to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]].&lt;ref name="AutoNT-52" /&gt;

=== Indentation ===
{{Main article|Python syntax and semantics#Indentation}}

Python uses [[whitespace character|whitespace]] indentation, rather than [[curly bracket programming language|curly brackets]] or keywords, to delimit [[block (programming)|blocks]]. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-53" /&gt; Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents the program's semantic structure.&lt;ref name=guttag&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 978-0-262-52962-4| last = Guttag| first = John V.| title = Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python: With Application to Understanding Data| date = 2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This feature is also sometimes termed the [[off-side rule]].

=== Statements and control flow ===
Python's [[Statement (computer science)|statements]] include (among others):

* The assignment statement (token '=', the equals sign). This operates differently than in traditional [[imperative programming]] languages, and this fundamental mechanism (including the nature of Python's version of ''variables'') illuminates many other features of the language. Assignment in [[C (programming language)|C]], e.g., &lt;code&gt;x = 2&lt;/code&gt;, translates to "typed variable name x receives a copy of numeric value 2". The (right-hand) value is copied into an [[Memory allocation|allocated storage location]] for which the (left-hand) [[Variable (computer science)|variable name]] is the symbolic address. The memory allocated to the variable is large enough (potentially quite large) for the declared [[Type system|type]]. In the simplest case of Python assignment, using the same example, &lt;code&gt;x = 2&lt;/code&gt;, translates to "(generic) name x receives a [[Pointer (computer programming)|reference]] to a separate, dynamically allocated [[Object (computer science)|object]] of numeric (int) type of value 2." This is termed ''binding'' the name to the object. Since the name's storage location doesn't ''contain'' the indicated value, it is improper to call it a ''variable''. Names may be subsequently rebound at any time to objects of greatly varying types, including strings, procedures, complex objects with data and methods, etc. Successive assignments of a common value to multiple names, e.g., &lt;code&gt;x = 2&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;y = 2&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;z = 2&lt;/code&gt; result in allocating storage to (at most) three names and one numeric object, to which all three names are bound. Since a name is a generic reference holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed [[Type system|data type]] with it. However at a given time a name will be bound to ''some'' object, which '''will''' have a type; thus there is [[Dynamic type|dynamic typing]].
* The &lt;code&gt;[[if-then-else|if]]&lt;/code&gt; statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;elif&lt;/code&gt; (a contraction of else-if).
* The &lt;code&gt;[[Foreach#Python|for]]&lt;/code&gt; statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.
* The &lt;code&gt;[[While loop#Python|while]]&lt;/code&gt; statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.
* The &lt;code&gt;[[Exception handling syntax#Python|try]]&lt;/code&gt; statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by &lt;code&gt;except&lt;/code&gt; clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; block will always be run regardless of how the block exits.
* The &lt;code&gt;raise&lt;/code&gt; statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception.
* The &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a [[class (computer science)|class]], for use in [[object-oriented programming]].
* The &lt;code&gt;def&lt;/code&gt; statement, which defines a [[function (computing)|function]] or [[method (computing)|method]].
* The &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statement, from Python 2.5 released on September 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5/|title=Python 2.5 Release|website=Python.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a [[lock (computer science)|lock]] before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a [[Computer file|file]] and then closing it), allowing [[Resource Acquisition Is Initialization]] (RAII)-like behavior and replaces a common try/finally idiom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5/highlights/|title=Highlights: Python 2.5|website=Python.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The &lt;code&gt;pass&lt;/code&gt; statement, which serves as a [[NOP (code)|NOP]]. It is syntactically needed to create an empty code block.
* The &lt;code&gt;[[assertion (programming)|assert]]&lt;/code&gt; statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that ought to apply.
* The &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; statement, which returns a value from a [[generator (computer science)#Python|generator]] function. From Python 2.5, &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; is also an operator. This form is used to implement [[coroutine]]s.
* The &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program. There are three ways of using import: &lt;code&gt;import &lt;module name&gt; [as &lt;alias&gt;]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;from &lt;module name&gt; import *&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;from &lt;module name&gt; import &lt;definition 1&gt; [as &lt;alias 1&gt;], &lt;definition 2&gt; [as &lt;alias 2&gt;], ...&lt;/code&gt;.
* The &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; statement was changed to the &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; function in Python 3.&lt;ref name="diff_py2-3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sweigart |first=Al|year=2010|chapter=Appendix A: Differences Between Python 2 and 3 |title=Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python |url=https://inventwithpython.com/appendixa.html|edition=2|isbn=978-0-9821060-1-3 |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Python does not support [[tail call]] optimization or [[first-class continuations]], and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-55" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoNT-56" /&gt; However, better support for [[coroutine]]-like functionality is provided in 2.5, by extending Python's [[generator (computer science)|generators]].&lt;ref name="AutoNT-57" /&gt; Before 2.5, generators were [[lazy evaluation|lazy]] [[iterator]]s; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-58" /&gt;

=== Expressions ===
Some Python [[Expression (computer science)|expressions]] are similar to languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], while some are not:

* Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python. They are floor division and integer division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=division|url=https://docs.python.org|website=python.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Python also added the &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; operator for exponentiation.
* From Python 3.5, the new &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; infix operator was introduced. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for [[matrix multiplication]].&lt;ref name=PEP465&gt;{{cite web |title=PEP 0465 -- A dedicated infix operator for matrix multiplication |url=https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0465/|website=python.org |accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Python3.5Changelog&gt;{{cite web |title=Python 3.5.1 Release and Changelog |url=https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-351/|website=python.org |accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Python, &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.21.1 |title=Chapter 15. Expressions - 15.21.1. Numerical Equality Operators == and != |publisher=[[Oracle Corporation]] |accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and objects by reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.21.3 |title=Chapter 15. Expressions - 15.21.3. Reference Equality Operators == and != |publisher=Oracle Corporation |accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Value comparisons in Java on objects can be performed with the &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; method.) Python's &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). In Python, comparisons may be chained, for example &lt;code&gt;a &lt;= b &lt;= c&lt;/code&gt;. 
* Python uses the words &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt; for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; used in Java and C.
* Python has a type of expression termed a ''[[list comprehension#Python|list comprehension]]''. Python 2.4 extended list comprehensions into a more general expression termed a ''[[generator (computer science)|generator]] expression''.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-59" /&gt;
* [[Anonymous function]]s are implemented using [[Lambda (programming)|lambda expressions]]; however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression.
* Conditional expressions in Python are written as &lt;code&gt;x if c else y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoNT-60" /&gt; (different in order of operands from the &lt;code&gt;[[?:|c ? x : y]]&lt;/code&gt; operator common to many other languages).
* Python makes a distinction between [[list (computer science)|lists]] and [[tuple]]s. Lists are written as &lt;code&gt;[1, 2, 3]&lt;/code&gt;, are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be [[immutable]] in Python). Tuples are written as &lt;code&gt;(1, 2, 3)&lt;/code&gt;, are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. Thus, given the variable &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; initially equal to &lt;code&gt;(1, 2, 3)&lt;/code&gt;, executing &lt;code&gt;t = t + (4, 5)&lt;/code&gt; first evaluates &lt;code&gt;t + (4, 5)&lt;/code&gt;, which yields &lt;code&gt;(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)&lt;/code&gt;, which is then assigned back to &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;, thereby effectively "modifying the contents" of &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4. Built-in Types &amp;#8212; Python 3.6.3rc1 documentation|url=https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple|website=python.org|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Python features ''sequence unpacking'' where multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to (a variable, a writable property, etc.), are associated in the identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an ''iterable'' object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through, and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5.3. Tuples and Sequences &amp;#8212; Python 3.7.1rc2 documentation|url=https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences|website=python.org|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Python has a "string format" operator &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;. This functions analogous to &lt;code&gt;[[printf]]&lt;/code&gt; format strings in [[C (programming language)|C]], e.g. &lt;code&gt;"spam=%s eggs=%d" % ("blah", 2)&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to &lt;code&gt;"spam=blah eggs=2"&lt;/code&gt;. In Python 3 and 2.6+, this was supplemented by the &lt;code&gt;format()&lt;/code&gt; method of the &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; class, e.g. &lt;code&gt;"spam={0} eggs={1}".format("blah", 2)&lt;/code&gt;. Python 3.6 added "f-strings": &lt;code&gt;blah = "blah"; eggs = 2; f'spam={blah} eggs={eggs}'&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name="pep-0498"&gt;{{cite web |title=PEP 498 -- Literal String Interpolation |url=https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/|website=python.org |accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Python has various kinds of [[string literal]]s:
** Strings delimited by single or double quote marks. Unlike in [[Unix shell]]s, [[Perl]] and Perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. Both kinds of string use the backslash (&lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;) as an [[escape character]]. [[String interpolation]] became available in Python 3.6 as "formatted string literals".&lt;ref name="pep-0498"/&gt;
** Triple-quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. They may span multiple lines and function like [[here document]]s in shells, Perl and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]].
** [[Raw string]] varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as [[regular expression]]s and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-style paths. Compare "&lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;-quoting" in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]].
* Python has [[array index]] and [[array slicing]] expressions on lists, denoted as &lt;code&gt;a[key]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;a[start:stop]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;a[start:stop:step]&lt;/code&gt;. Indexes are [[zero-based]], and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the ''start'' index up to, but not including, the ''stop'' index. The third slice parameter, called ''step'' or ''stride'', allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example &lt;code&gt;a[:]&lt;/code&gt; returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a [[shallow copy]].

In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as [[Common Lisp]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], or [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]. This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example:

* [[List comprehensions]] vs. &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;-loops
* [[Conditional (programming)|Conditional]] expressions vs. &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; blocks
* The &lt;code&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt; vs. &lt;code&gt;exec()&lt;/code&gt; built-in functions (in Python 2, &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt; is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements.

Statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or [[Lambda (programming)|lambda expressions]], all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as &lt;code&gt;a = 1&lt;/code&gt; cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; for an equality operator &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; in conditions: &lt;code&gt;if (c = 1) { ... }&lt;/code&gt; is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) C code but &lt;code&gt;if c = 1: ...&lt;/code&gt; causes a syntax error in Python.

=== Methods ===
[[Method (programming)|Methods]] on objects are [[function (programming)|functions]] attached to the object's class; the syntax &lt;code&gt;instance.method(argument)&lt;/code&gt; is, for normal methods and functions, [[syntactic sugar]] for &lt;code&gt;Class.method(instance, argument)&lt;/code&gt;. Python methods have an explicit &lt;code&gt;[[this (computer programming)|self]]&lt;/code&gt; parameter to access [[instance data]], in contrast to the implicit &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt;) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Objective-C]], or [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]).&lt;ref name="AutoNT-61" /&gt;

=== Typing ===
[[File:Python 3. The standard type hierarchy.png|thumb]]
Python uses [[duck typing]] and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at [[compile time]]; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. Despite being [[Type system#Dynamic type checking and runtime type information|dynamically typed]], Python is [[strongly typed programming language|strongly typed]], forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.

Python allows programmers to define their own types using [[class (computer science)|classes]], which are most often used for [[object-oriented programming]]. New [[object (computer science)|instances]] of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, &lt;code&gt;SpamClass()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;EggsClass()&lt;/code&gt;), and the classes are instances of the [[metaclass]] &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; (itself an instance of itself), allowing [[metaprogramming]] and [[reflection (computer science)|reflection]].

Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes: ''old-style'' and ''new-style''.&lt;ref name="classy" /&gt; The syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; is inherited from, directly or indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; and are instances of &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;). In versions of Python 2 from Python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were eliminated in Python 3.0.

The long term plan is to support [[gradual typing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/627418/ |title=Type hinting for Python |publisher=LWN.net |date=24 December 2014 |accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from Python 3.5, the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython. An experimental optional static type checker named ''mypy'' supports compile-time type checking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mypy-lang.org/ |title=mypy - Optional Static Typing for Python |publisher= |accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics ===
Python has the usual C language arithmetic operators (&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;). It also has &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; for exponentiation, e.g. &lt;code&gt;5**3 == 125&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;9**0.5 == 3.0&lt;/code&gt;, and a new matrix multiply &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; operator is included in version 3.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0465/ |title=PEP 465 -- A dedicated infix operator for matrix multiplication |work=python.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it has a unary operator (&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;), which essentially inverts all the bits of its one argument. For integers, this means &lt;code&gt;~x=-x-1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8305199/the-tilde-operator-in-python |title=The tilde operator in Python - Stackoverflow |work=stackoverflow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other operators include bitwise shift operators &lt;code&gt;x &lt;&lt; y&lt;/code&gt;, which shifts &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to the left &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; places, the same as &lt;code&gt;x*(2**y) &lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;x &gt;&gt; y&lt;/code&gt;, which shifts &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to the right &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; places, the same as &lt;code&gt;x//(2**y) &lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators |title=BitwiseOperators - Python Wiki |work=wiki.python.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:&lt;ref name="pep0238"/&gt;{{Why|date=May 2018}}

* Python 2.1 and earlier use the C division behavior. The &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating-point division otherwise. Integer division rounds towards 0, e.g. {{nowrap|1=&lt;code&gt;7/3 == 2&lt;/code&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1=&lt;code&gt;-7/3 == -2&lt;/code&gt;.}}
* Python 2.2 changes integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. &lt;code&gt;7/3 == 2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-7/3 == -3&lt;/code&gt;. The floor division &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt; operator is introduced. So &lt;code&gt;7//3 == 2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-7//3 == -3&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;7.5//3 == 2.0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-7.5//3 == -3.0&lt;/code&gt;. Adding &lt;code&gt;from __future__ import division&lt;/code&gt; causes a module to use Python 3.0 rules for division (see next).
* Python 3.0 changes &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; to be always floating-point division. In Python terms, the pre-3.0 &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; is ''classic division'', the version-3.0 &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; is ''real division'', and &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt; is ''floor division''.

Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation &lt;code&gt;(a + b)//b == a//b + 1&lt;/code&gt; is always true. It also means that the equation &lt;code&gt;b*(a//b) + a%b == a&lt;/code&gt; is valid for both positive and negative values of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of &lt;code&gt;a%b&lt;/code&gt; is, as expected, in the [[half-open interval]] [0, ''b''), where &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (''b'', 0] when &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is negative.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-62" /&gt;

Python provides a &lt;code&gt;round&lt;/code&gt; function for [[rounding]] a float to the nearest integer. For [[Rounding#Tie-breaking|tie-breaking]], versions before 3 use round-away-from-zero: &lt;code&gt;round(0.5)&lt;/code&gt; is 1.0, &lt;code&gt;round(-0.5)&lt;/code&gt; is −1.0.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-63" /&gt; Python 3 uses [[round to even]]: &lt;code&gt;round(1.5)&lt;/code&gt; is 2, &lt;code&gt;round(2.5)&lt;/code&gt; is 2.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-64" /&gt;

Python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression &lt;code&gt;a &lt; b &lt; c&lt;/code&gt; tests whether &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is less than &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is less than &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-65" /&gt;  C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate &lt;code&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/code&gt;, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name="CPL" /&gt;

Python has extensive built-in support for [[arbitrary precision arithmetic]]. Integers are transparently switched from the machine-supported maximum fixed-precision (usually 32 or 64 bits), belonging to the python type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, to arbitrary precision, belonging to the Python type &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;, where needed. The latter have an "L" suffix in their textual representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Built-in Type|url = https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/stdtypes.html|website = docs.python.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In Python 3, the distinction between the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; types was eliminated; this behavior is now entirely contained by the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; class.) The &lt;code&gt;Decimal&lt;/code&gt; type/class in module &lt;code&gt;decimal&lt;/code&gt; (since version 2.4) provides decimal floating point numbers to arbitrary precision and several rounding modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = PEP 0327 -- Decimal Data Type|url = https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0327/|website = Python.org|accessdate = 26 September 2015|last = Batista|first = Facundo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &lt;code&gt;Fraction&lt;/code&gt; type in module &lt;code&gt;fractions&lt;/code&gt; (since version 2.6) provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = What’s New in Python 2.6 — Python v2.6.9 documentation|url = https://docs.python.org/2.6/whatsnew/2.6.html|website = docs.python.org|accessdate = 26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Python's extensive mathematics library, and the third-party library [[NumPy]] that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

== Libraries ==
Python's large [[standard library]], commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths,&lt;ref name="AutoNT-86" /&gt; provides tools suited to many tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as [[MIME]] and [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] are supported. It includes modules for creating [[graphical user interface]]s, connecting to [[relational database]]s, [[pseudorandom number generator|generating pseudorandom numbers]], arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals,&lt;ref name="AutoNT-88" /&gt; manipulating [[regular expression]]s, and [[unit testing]].

Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the [[Web Server Gateway Interface]] (WSGI) implementation &lt;code&gt;wsgiref&lt;/code&gt; follows PEP 333&lt;ref name="AutoNT-89" /&gt;), but most modules are not. They are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites (if supplied). However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations.

{{As of|2018|03|post=,}} the [[Python Package Index]] (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 130,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modulecounts.com/ |title=Module Counts |date=|website=ModuleCounts |publisher=|last1=Debill|first1=Erik |accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; packages with a wide range of functionality, including:

* Graphical user interfaces
* Web frameworks
* Multimedia
* Databases
* Networking 
* Test frameworks
* Automation
* Web scraping&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://likegeeks.com/python-web-scraping/|title=20+ Python Web Scraping Examples (Beautiful Soup &amp; Selenium) - Like Geeks|date=5 December 2017|website=likegeeks.com|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Documentation
* System administration
* Scientific computing
* Text processing
* Image processing

== Development environments ==
{{See also|Comparison of integrated development environments#Python}}

Most Python implementations (including CPython) include a [[read–eval–print loop]] (REPL), permitting them to function as a [[command line interpreter]] for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately.

Other shells, including [[IDLE (Python)|IDLE]] and [[IPython]], add further abilities such as auto-completion, session state retention and [[syntax highlighting]].

As well as standard desktop [[integrated development environment]]s, there are [[Web browser]]-based IDEs; [[SageMath]] (intended for developing science and math-related Python programs); [[PythonAnywhere]], a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and Canopy IDE, a commercial Python IDE emphasizing scientific computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Enthought|first1=Canopy |title=Canopy |url=https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/|website=www.enthought.com |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementations ==
{{See also|List of Python software#Python implementations}}

=== Reference implementation ===
[[CPython]] is the [[reference implementation]] of Python. It is written in [[C (programming language)|C]], meeting the [[C89 (C version)|C89]] standard with several select [[C99]] features.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-66" /&gt; It compiles Python programs into an intermediate [[bytecode]]&lt;ref name="AutoNT-67" /&gt; which is then executed by its [[virtual machine]].&lt;ref name="AutoNT-68" /&gt; CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and native Python. It is available for many platforms, including [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and most modern [[Unix-like]] systems. Platform portability was one of its earliest priorities.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-69" /&gt;

=== Other implementations ===
[[PyPy]] is a fast, compliant&lt;ref name="AutoNT-70" /&gt; interpreter of Python 2.7 and 3.5. Its [[Just-in-time compilation|just-in-time compiler]] brings a significant speed improvement over CPython.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-71" /&gt;

[[Stackless Python]] is a significant fork of CPython that implements [[microthread]]s; it does not use the C memory stack, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also has a stackless version.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-73" /&gt;

[[MicroPython]] and [[CircuitPython]] are Python 3 variants optimised for [[microcontroller]]s.

=== Unsupported implementations ===
Other just-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported:

* Google began a project named [[Unladen Swallow]] in 2009 with the aim of speeding up the Python interpreter fivefold by using the [[LLVM]], and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-74" /&gt;
* [[Psyco]] is a [[Just-in-time compilation|just-in-time]] [[Run-time algorithm specialisation|specialising]] compiler that integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The emitted code is specialised for certain [[data type]]s and is faster than standard Python code.

In 2005, [[Nokia]] released a Python interpreter for the [[Series 60]] mobile phones named [[PyS60]]. It includes many of the modules from the CPython implementations and some additional modules to integrate with the [[Symbian]] operating system. The project has been kept up-to-date to run on all variants of the S60 platform, and several third-party modules are available. The Nokia [[N900]] also supports Python with [[GTK]] widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Python on the Nokia N900 |url=http://www.stochasticgeometry.ie/2010/04/29/python-on-the-nokia-n900/|website=Stochastic Geometry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cross-compilers to other languages ===
There are several compilers to high-level [[object language]]s, with either unrestricted Python, a restricted subset of Python, or a language similar to Python as the source language:
* [[Jython]] compiles into Java byte code, which can then be executed by every [[Java virtual machine]] implementation. This also enables the use of Java class library functions from the Python program.
* [[IronPython]] follows a similar approach in order to run Python programs on the .NET [[Common Language Runtime]].
* The [[RPython]] language can be compiled to [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Java bytecode]], or [[Common Intermediate Language]], and is used to build the PyPy interpreter of Python.
* [[Pyjs]] compiles Python to [[JavaScript]].
* [[Cython]] compiles Python to [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]].
* Pythran compiles Python to [[C++]].
* Somewhat dated [[Pyrex (programming language)|Pyrex]] (latest release in 2010) and [[Shed Skin]] (latest release in 2013) compile to C and C++ respectively.
* Google's Grumpy compiles Python to [[Go (programming language)|Go]].
* [[MyHDL]] compiles Python to [[VHDL]].
* [[Nuitka]] compiles Python into C++.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuitka.net/|title=Nuitka Home {{!}} Nuitka Home|website=nuitka.net|language=en|access-date=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performance ===
A performance comparison of various Python implementations on a non-numerical (combinatorial) workload was presented at EuroSciPy '13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=Performance of Python runtimes on a non-numeric scientific code |last=Murri |first=Riccardo |conference=European Conference on Python in Science (EuroSciPy) |year=2013 |arxiv=1404.6388|bibcode=2014arXiv1404.6388M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Python's development is conducted largely through the ''Python Enhancement Proposal'' (PEP) process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues and documenting Python design decisions.&lt;ref name="PepCite000" /&gt; Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and Guido Van Rossum, Python's [[Benevolent Dictator For Life]].&lt;ref name="PepCite000" /&gt;

Enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language's development. Specific issues are discussed in the [[Roundup (issue tracker)|Roundup]] [[bug tracker]] maintained at python.org.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-21" /&gt; Development originally took place on a [[self-hosted]] source-code repository running [[Mercurial]], until Python moved to [[GitHub]] in January 2017.&lt;ref name=py_dev_guide&gt;{{cite web |title=Python Developer's Guide |url=https://docs.python.org/devguide/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPython's public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented:

* Backward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and need to be manually [[ported]]. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently—for example, version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0.
* Major or "feature" releases, about every 18 months, are largely compatible but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release.&lt;ref name="release-schedule" /&gt;
* Bugfix releases, which introduce no new features, occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-22" /&gt;

Many [[beta release|alpha, beta, and release-candidates]] are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. Python's development team monitors the state of the code by running the large [[unit test]] suite during development, and using the [[BuildBot]] [[continuous integration]] system.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-23" /&gt;

The community of Python developers has also contributed over 86,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeBill|first1=Erik |title=Module Counts |url=http://www.modulecounts.com/#|website=www.modulecounts.com |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; software modules ({{as of|2016|08|20|lc=yes}}) to the [[Python Package Index]] (PyPI), the official repository of third-party Python libraries.

The major [[academic conference]] on Python is [[PyCon]]. There are also special Python mentoring programmes, such as [[Pyladies]].

== Naming ==
Python's name is derived from the British comedy group [[Monty Python]], whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture;&lt;ref name="tutorial-chapter1" /&gt; for example, the [[metasyntactic variable]]s often used in Python literature are [[Spam (Monty Python)|''spam'' and ''eggs'']] instead of the traditional [[foobar|''foo'' and ''bar'']].&lt;ref name="tutorial-chapter1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoNT-26" /&gt; The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python routines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lutz |first1=Mark |title=Learning Python: Powerful Object-Oriented Programming |year=2009 |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |isbn=9781449379322 |page=17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HxWGezDZcgC&amp;pg=PA17 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fehily |first1=Chris |title=Python |year=2002 |publisher=Peachpit Press |isbn=9780201748840 |page=xv |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=carqdIdfVlYC&amp;pg=PR15 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prefix ''Py-'' is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix in names of Python applications or libraries include [[Pygame]], a [[language binding|binding]] of [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]] to Python (commonly used to create games); [[PyQt]] and [[PyGTK]], which bind [[Qt (software)|Qt]] and [[GTK]] to Python respectively; and [[PyPy]], a Python implementation originally written in Python.

Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the [[TIOBE Programming Community Index]] where, {{as of|2018|1|lc=y}}, it is the fourth most popular language (behind [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C (programming language)|C]], and [[C++]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/ |title=TIOBE Index |publisher=TIOBE - The Software Quality Company |accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was selected Programming Language of the Year in 2007 and 2010.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-34" /&gt;

An empirical study found that scripting languages, such as Python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as C and Java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often "better than Java and not much worse than C or C++".&lt;ref name="AutoNT-28" /&gt;

Large organizations that use Python include [[Wikipedia]], [[Google]],&lt;ref name="quotes-about-python" /&gt; [[Yahoo!]],&lt;ref name="AutoNT-29" /&gt; [[CERN]],&lt;ref name="AutoNT-30" /&gt; [[NASA]],&lt;ref name="AutoNT-31" /&gt; [[Facebook]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/301|title=Tornado: Facebook's Real-Time Web Framework for Python - Facebook for Developers|website=Facebook for Developers|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Instagram]], [[Spotify]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://labs.spotify.com/2013/03/20/how-we-use-python-at-spotify/|title=How we use Python at Spotify|website=Spotify Labs|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some smaller entities like [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic|ILM]]&lt;ref name="AutoNT-32" /&gt; and [[ITA Software|ITA]].&lt;ref name="AutoNT-33" /&gt; The social news networking site [[Reddit]] is written entirely in Python.

Python can serve as a [[scripting language]] for [[web application]]s, e.g., via [[mod_wsgi]] for the [[Apache web server]].&lt;ref name="AutoNT-35" /&gt; With [[Web Server Gateway Interface]], a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. [[Web framework]]s like [[Django (web framework)|Django]], [[Pylons (web framework)|Pylons]], [[Pyramid (web framework)|Pyramid]], [[TurboGears]], [[web2py]], [[Tornado (web server)|Tornado]], [[Flask (web framework)|Flask]], [[Bottle (web framework)|Bottle]] and [[Zope]] support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. [[Pyjs]] and [[IronPython]] can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. [[SQLAlchemy]] can be used as [[Data mapper pattern|data mapper]] to a relational database. [[Twisted (software)|Twisted]] is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used (for example) by [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]].

Libraries such as [[NumPy]], [[SciPy]] and [[Matplotlib]] allow the effective use of Python in scientific computing,&lt;ref name="cise"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oliphant |first=Travis |title=Python for Scientific Computing |journal=Computing in Science and Engineering |year=2007 |url=https://www.h2desk.com/blog/python-scientific-computing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="millman"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=K.

[[SageMath]] is a [[mathematical software]] with a [[notebook interface]] programmable in Python: its library covers many aspects of [[mathematics]], including [[algebra]], [[combinatorics]], [[numerical mathematics]], [[number theory]], and [[calculus]].

Python has been successfully embedded in many software products as a scripting language, including in [[finite element method]] software such as [[Abaqus]], 3D parametric modeler like [[FreeCAD]], 3D animation packages such as [[3ds Max]], [[Blender (software)|Blender]], [[Cinema 4D]], [[Lightwave]], [[Houdini (software)|Houdini]], [[Maya (software)|Maya]], [[modo (software)|modo]], [[MotionBuilder]], [[Autodesk Softimage|Softimage]], the visual effects compositor [[Nuke (software)|Nuke]], 2D imaging programs like [[GIMP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/faq.html |title=Installers for GIMP for Windows - Frequently Asked Questions |author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --&gt; |date=26 July 2013 |accessdate=26 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717070814/http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/faq.html |archivedate=17 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inkscape]], [[Scribus]] and [[Paint Shop Pro]],&lt;ref name="AutoNT-38" /&gt; and [[musical notation]] programs like [[scorewriter]] and [[Capella (notation program)|capella]]. [[GNU Debugger]] uses Python as a [[Prettyprint|pretty printer]] to show complex structures such as C++ containers. [[Esri]] promotes Python as the best choice for writing scripts in [[ArcGIS]].&lt;ref name="AutoNT-39" /&gt; It has also been used in several video games,&lt;ref name="AutoNT-40" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoNT-41" /&gt; and has been adopted as first of the three available [[programming language]]s in [[Google App Engine]], the other two being [[Java (software platform)|Java]] and [[Go (programming language)|Go]].&lt;ref name="AutoNT-42" /&gt; Python is also used in [[algorithmic trading]] and quantitative finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quantinsti.com/blog/python-best-programming-language-algorithmic-trading/ |title=Python - Best Programming Language for Algorithmic Trading Systems |date=9 March 2016|language=en-US|access-date=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Python can also be implemented in APIs of online brokerages that run on other languages by using wrappers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quantinsti.com/blog/ibpy-tutorial-implement-python-interactive-brokers-api/ |title=Trading with Interactive Brokers using Python: An IBPy Tutorial |date=19 September 2016|language=en-US|access-date=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Python is commonly used in [[artificial intelligence]] projects with the help of libraries like [[TensorFlow]], [[Keras]] and [[Scikit-learn]].&lt;ref name=whitepaper2015&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Dean |first1 = Jeff |last2 = Monga |first2 = Rajat |first3 = Sanjay |last3 = Ghemawat |display-authors = 2 |authorlink1 = Jeff Dean (computer scientist) |title = TensorFlow: Large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous systems |url = http://download.tensorflow.org/paper/whitepaper2015.pdf |website = TensorFlow.org |publisher = Google Research |accessdate = November 10, 2015 |date = November 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Piatetsky |first1=Gregory |title=Python eats away at R: Top Software for Analytics, Data Science, Machine Learning in 2018: Trends and Analysis |url=https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/poll-tools-analytics-data-science-machine-learning-results.html/2 |website=KDnuggets |publisher=KDnuggets |accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scikit-learn.org/stable/testimonials/testimonials.html|title=Who is using scikit-learn? — scikit-learn 0.20.1 documentation|website=scikit-learn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Jouppi |first1 = Norm |title = Google supercharges machine learning tasks with TPU custom chip |url = https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html |website = Google Cloud Platform Blog |accessdate = May 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a scripting language with [[modular programming|modular architecture]], simple syntax and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for [[natural language processing]].&lt;ref name="AutoNT-47" /&gt;

Many operating systems include Python as a standard component. It ships with most [[Linux distribution]]s, [[AmigaOS 4]], [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]] and [[macOS]], and can be used from the command line (terminal). Many Linux distributions use installers written in Python: [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] uses the [[Ubiquity (software)|Ubiquity]] installer, while [[Red Hat Linux]] and [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] use the [[Anaconda (installer)|Anaconda]] installer. [[Gentoo Linux]] uses Python in its [[package management system]], [[Portage (software)|Portage]].

Python is used extensively in the [[information security]] industry, including in exploit development.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-49" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoNT-50" /&gt;

Most of the [[Sugar (software)|Sugar]] software for the [[One Laptop per Child]] XO, now developed at [[Sugar Labs]], is written in Python.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-51" /&gt; The [[Raspberry Pi]] [[single-board computer]] project has adopted Python as its main user-programming language.

[[LibreOffice]] includes Python, and intends to replace Java with Python. Its Python Scripting Provider is a core feature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=4.0 New Features and Fixes |publisher=[[The Document Foundation]] |work=LibreOffice.org |year=2013 |url=http://www.libreoffice.org/download/4-0-new-features-and-fixes/ |accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; since Version 4.0 from 7 February 2013.

== Languages influenced by Python ==
Python's design and philosophy have influenced many other programming languages:

* [[Boo (programming language)|Boo]] uses indentation, a similar syntax, and a similar object model.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-90" /&gt;
* [[Cobra (programming language)|Cobra]] uses indentation and a similar syntax, and its "Acknowledgements" document lists Python first among languages that influenced it.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-91" /&gt; However, Cobra directly supports [[Design by contract|design-by-contract]], [[Unit testing|unit tests]], and optional [[static typing]].&lt;ref name="AutoNT-92" /&gt;
* [[CoffeeScript]], a programming language that cross-compiles to JavaScript, has Python-inspired syntax.
* [[ECMAScript]] borrowed [[iterator]]s and [[generator (computer science)|generators]] from Python.&lt;ref name="AutoNT-93" /&gt;
* [[Go (programming language)|Go]] is designed for the "speed of working in a dynamic language like Python"&lt;ref name="AutoNT-94"/&gt; and shares the same syntax for slicing arrays.
* [[Groovy (programming language)|Groovy]] was motivated by the desire to bring the Python design philosophy to [[Java (programming language)|Java]].&lt;ref name="AutoNT-95" /&gt;
* [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]] was designed "with [[hygienic macro|true macros]] [.. and to be] as usable for general programming as Python&lt;!--, as easy for statistics as R, as natural for string processing as Perl, as powerful for linear algebra as Matlab, as good at gluing programs together as the shell. Something that is dirt simple to learn, yet keeps the most serious hackers happy. We want it interactive and we want it compiled.
(Did we mention it --&gt; [and] should be as fast as C&lt;!--?--&gt;".&lt;ref name=Julia&gt;{{cite web| title= Why We Created Julia| date= February 2012| website= Julia website| url= https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia| accessdate= 5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling to or from Julia is possible; to with PyCall.jl and a Python package pyjulia allows calling, in the other direction, from Python.
* [[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]] is a functional programming language with an interactive shell similar to Python. However, Kotlin is strongly typed with access to standard Java libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html|title=Working with the Command Line Compiler - Kotlin Programming Language|website=Kotlin|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]'s creator, [[Yukihiro Matsumoto]], has said: "I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python. That's why I decided to design my own language."&lt;ref name="linuxdevcenter" /&gt;
* [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]], a programming language developed by Apple, has some Python-inspired syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nondot.org/sabre |title=Chris Lattner's Homepage |publisher=Chris Lattner |first=Chris |last=Lattner |authorlink=Chris Lattner |date=3 June 2014 |accessdate=3 June 2014 |quote=I started work on the Swift Programming Language in July of 2010. I implemented much of the basic language structure, with only a few people knowing of its existence. A few other (amazing) people started contributing in earnest late in 2011, and it became a major focus for the Apple Developer Tools group in July 2013 [...] drawing ideas from Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, C#, CLU, and far too many others to list.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gdscript|GDScript]], dynamically typed programming language used to create video-games. It is extremely similar to Python with a few minor differences.

Python's development practices have also been emulated by other languages. For example, the practice of requiring a document describing the rationale for, and issues surrounding, a change to the language (in Python, a PEP) is also used in [[Tcl]]&lt;ref name="AutoNT-99" /&gt; and [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]].&lt;ref name="AutoNT-100" /&gt;

Python received TIOBE's Programming Language of the Year awards in 2007 and 2010. The award is given to the language with the greatest growth in popularity over the year, as measured by the [[TIOBE index]].&lt;ref name="AutoNT-101" /&gt;

== Further reading ==
&lt;!-- THIS IS *NOT* A LIST OF ALL PYTHON BOOKS
According to [[Wikipedia:Further reading]], criteria for inclusion includes:
1. Should clearly qualify as WP:RS, as indicated by reviews and citations to it.
...
5. There should be guidelines on limiting the number of sources.
6. To avoid spam, any book included should have received more than one good review in RS: newspapers and scholarly journals being the norm, and the clear balance of RS reviews should be positive. This would avoid self-publish spamming, POV pushing, and attempts by publishers to get books promoted through inclusion on Wikipedia. At the moment "editorial recommendations" as described in the manual smacks of OR.
7. Neutrality on the part of editors is essential. In terms of major debates, items representing all major positions should be included, with annotations indicating the specific POV of each. We may have to work out rules where topic disputes are irreconcilable.

'''''The Chronicles and Memorials of Great Britain and Ireland during the Middle Ages''''' ({{lang-la|Rerum Britannicarum medii aevi scriptores}}), widely known as the {{nowrap|'''Rolls Series''',}} is a major collection of British and Irish historical materials and primary sources published as 99 works in 253 volumes between 1858 and 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Knowles 1961, p. 155 (Knowles 1963, p. 128).&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the great medieval English [[chronicle]]s were included: most existing editions, published by scholars of the 17th and 18th centuries, were considered to be unsatisfactory. The scope was also extended to include legendary, folklore and [[Hagiography|hagiographical]] materials, and [[Archives|archival]] records and legal tracts. The series was government-funded, and takes its unofficial name from the fact that its volumes were published "by the authority of Her Majesty's Treasury, under the direction of the [[Master of the Rolls]]",&lt;ref&gt;This statement, or some close variant, appears on the title pages of all volumes.&lt;/ref&gt; who was the official custodian of the records of the [[Court of Chancery]] and other courts, and nominal head of the [[Public Record Office]].

==The project==
The publication of the series was undertaken by the British Government in accordance with a scheme submitted in 1857 by the Master of the Rolls, then Sir [[John Romilly]]. A previous undertaking of the same kind, the ''[[Monumenta Historica Britannica]]'', had failed after the publication of the first volume (1036 folio pages, London, 1848). The principal editor, [[Henry Petrie (antiquary)|Henry Petrie]] had died, and its form was cumbrous. Representations were made by [[Joseph Stevenson]], and the scheme of 1857 was the direct outcome of this appeal. Alongside Romilly and Stevenson, another key figure in shaping the direction of the project in its early years was [[Thomas Duffus Hardy]], who served as Deputy Keeper of the Public Records from 1861 to 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Knowles 1963, pp. 102–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The first two volumes were published in February 1858: they were the first volume of Stevenson's own edition of the ''[[Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis]]'', a 12th-century chronicle written at [[Abingdon Abbey]] (the second and final volume appeared a few months later); and [[Francis Charles Hingeston-Randolph|F. C. Hingeston]]'s edition of [[John Capgrave]]'s fifteenth-century ''Historia de Illustribus Henricis''. Hingeston's work was slapdash, and reviews were unfavourable.&lt;ref&gt;Knowles 1963, pp. 112–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prolific and well-regarded editors for the series included [[William Stubbs]] (19 volumes), [[Henry Richards Luard|H. R. Luard]] (17 volumes), and [[Henry Thomas Riley|H. T. Riley]] (15 volumes). Editors were handsomely paid (Stubbs received, over the lifetime of the series, a total of some £6,600; Luard £6,432; and Riley £6,487).&lt;ref&gt;Knowles 1963, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; However, although editorial standards were often high, there was little supervision or opportunity for enforcing editorial quality, and little incentive for dilatory editors to bring their work to fruition; and as a result there were also less successful editions. In some quarters the project came to be regarded as providing an easy source of income for relatively little work.&lt;ref&gt;Knowles 1963, pp. 119–27, 131–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rolls Series label.jpg|thumb|right|Standard presentation label, in this case in a volume donated to [[University College, London]], reserving the right of the Stationery Office to reclaim the volume in the event of the library being broken up]]
Although at the beginning of the project Romilly insisted on a print run of 1,500 for each volume, this proved greatly over-optimistic in terms of sales, and 750 became the normal figure. The retail price per volume was initially 8[[Shilling|s]]. 6[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]]., later rising to 10[[Shilling|s]]. Initial sales figures for each volume generally reached something over 200 copies: this left considerable surplus stock, and so in the 1880s [[William Hardy (archivist)|William Hardy]], as Deputy Keeper, introduced the practice of presenting free copies to reputable public and university libraries, with a label inserted stating that "in the event of the Library being broken up", the volume should be returned to the Controller of [[Office of Public Sector Information|Her Majesty's Stationery Office]].&lt;ref&gt;Knowles 1963, pp. 129–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for the project began to be reduced from the mid-1880s, particularly following the appointment as Deputy Keeper in 1886 of [[Henry Maxwell Lyte]], who was concerned about the scholarly quality and pace of production, the funds being paid to unproductive editors, and who felt that his office's priorities should lie elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Knowles 1963, pp. 120–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, although work continued on editions already in progress, few new works were initiated. One of the final works in the series was the 13th-century legal compilation known as the ''[[Red Book of the Exchequer]]'', edited by [[Hubert Hall]] of the Public Record Office and published in three volumes in 1897. This became the occasion of a virulent and intemperate scholarly feud between Hall and [[J. Horace Round|J. H. Round]] (who had been co-editor, but who withdrew for reasons of ill-health and subsequently fell out with Hall): Round described the eventual edition as "so replete with heresy and error as to lead astray for ever all students of its subject", and "probably the most misleading publication in the whole range of the Rolls series".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Round |first=J. H. |authorlink=J.

W. Maitland]], which appeared in 1893; while the final volume to reach print was the second part of the ''[[Year Books|Year Book]]'' for the 20th year of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] (1346–7), edited by L. O. Pike, which appeared in 1911.

==Scope==
Chronicles published in the series included the edition of the ''[[Chronica Majora]]'' of [[Matthew Paris]] by [[Henry Richards Luard|H. R. Luard]]; the chronicles of [[Roger of Hoveden]], [[Benedict of Peterborough]], [[Ralph de Diceto]], [[Walter of Coventry]], and others, edited by [[William Stubbs]]; the works of [[Giraldus Cambrensis]] by [[John Sherren Brewer|J. S. Brewer]]; and the ''Materials for the History of St Thomas Becket'' by [[James Craigie Robertson]].

However, the scope of the series was not limited to conventional chronicles. It also encompassed materials of a more or less legendary character relating to Ireland and Scotland, such as [[Whitley Stokes (scholar)|Whitley Stokes]]'s edition of ''The Tripartite Life of St. Patrick'', and the [[Sagas of Icelanders|Icelandic sagas]] edited by [[Guðbrandur Vigfússon]] and [[George Webbe Dasent|G.W. Dasent]]; rhymed chronicles like those of [[Robert of Gloucester (historian)|Robert of Gloucester]] and [[Robert of Brunne]] in English, and that of [[Pierre de Langtoft]] in French; quasi-philosophical works like those of [[Roger Bacon]] and [[Alexander Neckam]], together with folklore materials like the three volumes of ''Leechdoms, Wortcunning and Starcraft'' of Anglo-Saxon times. [[Archives|Archival]] records and legal tracts, such as the ''[[Year Books]]'' of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] and [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], the ''[[Black Book of the Admiralty]]'', the ''[[Red Book of the Exchequer]]'', and [[Bracton]]'s work ''De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliæ'' were also included; as were [[Hagiography|hagiographical]] documents, dealing for example with the lives of [[Dunstan|St Dunstan]], St [[Edward the Confessor]], St [[Hugh of Lincoln]], St [[Thomas Becket]], and St [[Wilfrid]] and other northern saints.

==Editorial policy==
In the series as proposed, "preference was to be given in the first instance to such materials as were most scarce and valuable", each chronicle was to be edited as if the editor were engaged on an ''[[editio princeps]]'', and a brief account was to be provided in a suitable preface of the life and times of the author as well as a description of the manuscripts used.&lt;ref&gt;This statement of intent, dated December 1857, is published as a preamble to all volumes.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast bulk of the texts are in [[Medieval Latin|Latin]], printed without translation. [[Scribal abbreviation]]s are silently extended. Texts in [[Old French]], [[Old English]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Old Norse]], etc. have a translation annexed.

Volumes were published in [[octavo]] format.

==Kraus reprints==
Many of the Rolls Series volumes were reprinted under licence in the 1960s and 1970s by the Kraus Reprint Corporation (part of the Kraus-Thomson Organization Ltd.) of [[Millwood, New York]].

==Numbering of volumes==
The works published within the series were not sequentially numbered (although the individual parts of multi-volume works were numbered). This has presented bibliographers and librarians with a number of problems, and citations of volumes, and their arrangement within libraries, has therefore varied. Many libraries, however, adopted the unofficial numbering scheme, 1–99, used within [[Office of Public Sector Information|HMSO]] Sectional List 24, ''British National Archives''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=British National Archives |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information|HMSO Books]] |series=Sectional List |volume=24 |year=1981 |pages=36–47 }} This is also the numbering used by {{cite web |url=http://www.the-orb.net/rolls.html |title=Index to the Rolls Series |first=Steven H. |last=Silver |publisher=The ORB: On-line Reference Book for Medieval Studies |accessdate=26 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rosenhan experiment''' or '''Thud experiment''' was an experiment conducted to determine the validity of [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]. The experimenters feigned hallucinations to enter psychiatric hospitals, and acted normally afterwards. They were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders and were given [[antipsychotic]] drugs. The study was conducted by [[psychologist]] [[David Rosenhan]], a Stanford University professor, and published by the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1973 under the title "'''On being sane in insane places'''".&lt;ref name=Gaughwin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaughwin |first=Peter|title=On Being Insane in Medico-Legal Places: The Importance of Taking a Complete History in Forensic Mental Health Assessment |journal=Psychiatry, Psychology and Law |date=2011 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=298–310 |doi=10.1375/pplt.12.2.298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenhan&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rosenhan |first=David |title=On being sane in insane places |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=179 |issue=4070 |pages=250–258 |date=19 January 1973 |pmid=4683124 |doi=10.1126/science.179.4070.250 |url= http://web.cocc.edu/lminorevans/on_being_sane_in_insane_places.htm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20041117175255/http://web.cocc.edu/lminorevans/on_being_sane_in_insane_places.htm |archivedate=17 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered an important and influential criticism of psychiatric diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Slater&gt;{{cite book | last = Slater | first = Lauren | title = Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychological Experiments of the Twentieth Century | publisher = [[W. W. Norton]] |year=2004 | isbn = 0-393-05095-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rosenhan's study was done in two parts. The first part involved the use of healthy associates or "pseudopatients" (three women and five men, including Rosenhan himself) who briefly feigned auditory hallucinations in an attempt to gain admission to 12 psychiatric hospitals in five states in the United States. All were admitted and diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. After admission, the pseudopatients acted normally and told staff that they felt fine and had no longer experienced any additional hallucinations. All were forced to admit to having a mental illness and had to agree to take antipsychotic drugs as a condition of their release. The average time that the patients spent in the hospital was 19 days. All but one were diagnosed with schizophrenia "in remission" before their release.

The second part of his study involved an offended hospital administration challenging Rosenhan to send pseudopatients to its facility, whom its staff would then detect. Rosenhan agreed and in the following weeks out of 250 new patients the staff identified 41 as potential pseudopatients, with 2 of these receiving suspicion from at least one psychiatrist and one other staff member. In fact, Rosenhan had sent no pseudopatients to the hospital.

While listening to a lecture by [[R. D. Laing]], who was associated with the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement, Rosenhan conceived of the experiment as a way to test the reliability of psychiatric diagnoses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAsqKCQDgmA ''Rosenhan's Experiment: Being Sane in Insane Places'' speaker's voice over at 2:50] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201094915/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAsqKCQDgmA |date=February 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded "it is clear that we cannot distinguish the sane from the insane in psychiatric hospitals" and also illustrated the dangers of [[dehumanization]] and labeling in psychiatric institutions. It suggested that the use of community mental health facilities which concentrated on specific problems and behaviors rather than psychiatric labels might be a solution, and recommended education to make psychiatric workers more aware of the social psychology of their facilities.

== Pseudopatient experiment ==

Rosenhan himself and seven mentally healthy associates, called "pseudopatients," attempted to gain admission to psychiatric hospitals by calling for an appointment and feigning auditory hallucinations. The hospital staff were not informed of the experiment. The pseudopatients included a psychology graduate student in his twenties, three psychologists, a pediatrician, a psychiatrist, a painter, and a housewife. None had a history of mental illness. Pseudopatients used pseudonyms, and those who worked in the mental health field were given false jobs in a different sector to avoid invoking any special treatment or scrutiny. Apart from giving false names and employment details, further biographical details were truthfully reported.

During their initial psychiatric [[Health assessment|assessment]], the pseudopatients claimed to be hearing voices of the same sex as the patient which were often unclear, but which seemed to pronounce the words "empty," "hollow," "thud," and nothing else. These words were chosen as they vaguely suggest some sort of [[existential crisis]] and for the lack of any published literature referencing them as [[psychotic]] symptoms. No other psychiatric symptoms were claimed. If admitted, the pseudopatients were instructed to "act normally," reporting that they felt fine and no longer heard voices. Hospital records obtained after the experiment indicate that all pseudopatients were characterized as friendly and cooperative by staff.

All were admitted, to 12 psychiatric hospitals across the United States, including rundown and underfunded public hospitals in rural areas, urban university-run hospitals with excellent reputations, and one expensive private hospital. Though presented with identical symptoms, seven were diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]] at public hospitals, and one with [[manic-depressive psychosis]], a more optimistic diagnosis with better clinical outcomes, at the private hospital. Their stays ranged from 7 to 52 days, and the average was 19 days. All were discharged with a diagnosis of schizophrenia "in remission," which Rosenhan considered as evidence that mental illness is perceived as an irreversible condition creating a lifelong stigma rather than a curable illness.

Despite constantly and openly taking extensive notes on the behavior of the staff and other patients, none of the pseudopatients were identified as impostors by the hospital staff, although many of the other psychiatric patients seemed to be able to correctly identify them as impostors. In the first three hospitalizations, 35 of the total of 118 patients expressed a suspicion that the pseudopatients were sane, with some suggesting that the patients were researchers or journalists investigating the hospital. Hospital notes indicated that staff interpreted much of the pseudopatients' behavior in terms of mental illness. For example, one nurse labeled the note-taking of one pseudopatient as "writing behavior" and considered it [[psychopathology|pathological]]. The patients' normal biographies were recast in hospital records along the lines of what was expected of schizophrenics by the then-dominant theories of its cause.

The experiment required the pseudopatients to get out of the hospital on their own by getting the hospital to release them, though a lawyer was retained to be on call for emergencies when it became clear that the pseudopatients would not ever be voluntarily released on short notice. Once admitted and diagnosed, the pseudopatients were not able to obtain their release until they agreed with the psychiatrists that they were mentally ill and began taking [[antipsychotic]] medications, which they flushed down the toilet. No staff member noticed that the pseudopatients were flushing their medication down the toilets and did not report patients doing this.

Rosenhan and the other pseudopatients reported an overwhelming sense of [[dehumanization]], severe invasion of privacy, and boredom while hospitalized. Their possessions were searched randomly, and they were sometimes observed while using the toilet. They reported that though the staff seemed to be well-meaning, they generally objectified and dehumanized the patients, often discussing patients at length in their presence as though they were not there, and avoiding direct interaction with patients except as strictly necessary to perform official duties. Some attendants were prone to [[verbal abuse|verbal]] and [[physical abuse|physical]] [[abuse of patients]] when other staff were not present. A group of bored patients waiting outside the cafeteria for lunch early were said by a doctor to his students to be experiencing "oral-acquisitive" psychiatric symptoms. Contact with doctors averaged 6.8 minutes per day.

{{quotation|I told friends, I told my family: "I can get out when I can get out. That's all. I'll be there for a couple of days and I'll get out." Nobody knew I'd be there for two ''months'' ... The only way out was to point out that they're [the psychiatrists] correct. They had said I was insane, "I ''am'' insane; but I am getting better." That was an affirmation of their view of me.|David Rosenhan in the [[BBC]] program [[The Trap (television documentary series)|"The Trap"]]&lt;ref&gt;An excerpt from the BBC program with this statement by David Rosenhan can be viewed in [http://www.yoism.org/?q=node/234#laing Drug Pushers, Drug Users, Antidepressants, &amp;amp; School Shooters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219060558/http://www.yoism.org/?q=node%2F234 |date=2017-02-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Non-existent impostor experiment ==
For this experiment, Rosenhan used a well-known research and teaching hospital, whose staff had heard of the results of the initial study but claimed that similar errors could not be made at their institution. Rosenhan arranged with them that during a three-month period, one or more pseudopatients would attempt to gain admission and the staff would rate every incoming patient as to the likelihood they were an impostor. Out of 193 patients, 41 were considered to be impostors and a further 42 were considered suspect. In reality, Rosenhan had sent no pseudopatients; all patients suspected as impostors by the hospital staff were ordinary patients. This led to a conclusion that "any diagnostic process that lends itself too readily to massive errors of this sort cannot be a very reliable one".

There was also a significant reduction in the number of admissions to the hospital.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} This suggested that psychiatrists had been over-admitting before the non-experiment was conducted.

== Impact and controversy ==

Rosenhan published his findings in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', in which he criticized the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis and the disempowering and demeaning nature of patient care experienced by the associates in the study.&lt;ref name=Rosenhan /&gt; His article generated an explosion of controversy.

Many defended psychiatry, arguing that as psychiatric diagnosis relies largely on the patient's report of their experiences, faking their presence no more demonstrates problems with psychiatric diagnosis than lying about other medical symptoms. In this vein, psychiatrist [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]] quoted [[Seymour S. Kety]] in a 1975 criticism of Rosenhan's study:&lt;ref name=Spitzer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spitzer|first=Robert|title=On pseudoscience in science, logic in remission, and psychiatric diagnosis: a critique of Rosenhan's "On being sane in insane places"|journal=[[Journal of Abnormal Psychology]]|volume=84|issue=5|pages=442–52|date=October 1975|pmid=1194504|doi=10.1037/h0077124|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If I were to drink a quart of blood and, concealing what I had done, come to the emergency room of any hospital vomiting blood, the behavior of the staff would be quite predictable. If they labeled and treated me as having a bleeding peptic ulcer, I doubt that I could argue convincingly that medical science does not know how to diagnose that condition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kety also argued that psychiatrists should not necessarily be expected to assume that a patient is pretending to have mental illness, thus the study lacked realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.integratedsociopsychology.net/sane_insane-place.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405144718/http://www.integratedsociopsychology.net/sane_insane-place.html |archivedate=2012-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenhan called this the "experimenter effect" or "expectation bias", something indicative of the problems he uncovered rather than a problem in his methodology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frontierpsychiatrist.co.uk/the-rosenhan-experiment-examined/ "The Rosenhan experiment examined"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512035226/http://frontierpsychiatrist.co.uk/the-rosenhan-experiment-examined/ |date=2012-05-12 }}, ''Frontier Psychiatrist''&lt;/ref&gt;

The experiment "accelerated the movement to reform mental institutions and to [[deinstitutionalisation|deinstitutionalize]] as many mental patients as possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kornblum | first = William | editor1-last = Mitchell | editor1-first = Erin | editor2-last = Jucha | editor2-first = Robert | editor3-last = Chell | editor3-first = John | title = Sociology in a Changing World | edition = 9th | publisher = Cengage learning | year = 2011 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DtKcG6qoY5AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | format = Google Books | doi = | isbn = 978-1-111-30157-6 | page = 195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887 American [[investigative journalist]] [[Nellie Bly]] feigned symptoms of mental illness to gain admission to a [[lunatic asylum]] and report on the terrible conditions therein. The results were published as ''[[Ten Days in a Mad-House]]''.

In 1968 [[Maurice K. Temerlin]] split 25 psychiatrists into two groups and had them listen to an actor portraying a character of normal mental health. One group was told that the actor "was a very interesting man because he looked neurotic, but actually was quite psychotic" while the other was told nothing. Sixty percent of the former group diagnosed psychoses, most often schizophrenia, while none of the control group did so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Temerlin |first=Maurice |title=Suggestion effects in psychiatric diagnosis |journal=[[The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease]] |date=October 1968 |volume=147 |issue=4 |pages=349–353 |pmid=5683680 |url=http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Citation/1968/10000/Suggestion_Effects_in_Psychiatric_Diagnosis.3.aspx |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714011710/http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Citation/1968/10000/Suggestion_Effects_in_Psychiatric_Diagnosis.3.aspx |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Loring and Powell gave 290 psychiatrists a transcript of a patient interview and told half of them that the patient was black and the other half white; they concluded of the results that "clinicians appear to ascribe violence, suspiciousness, and dangerousness to black clients even though the case studies are the same as the case studies for the white clients."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Loring |first1=Marti |last2=Powell |first2=Brian |title=Gender, race, and DSM-III: a study of the objectivity of psychiatric diagnostic behavior |journal=[[Journal of Health and Social Behavior]] |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=1–22 |date=March 1988 |pmid=3367027 |doi=10.2307/2137177 |jstor=2137177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist and writer [[Lauren Slater]] claimed to have conducted an experiment very similar to Rosenhan's for her 2004 book ''Opening Skinner's Box''.&lt;ref name=Slater/&gt; Slater wrote that she had presented herself at 9 psychiatric emergency rooms with auditory hallucinations, resulting in being diagnosed "almost every time" with psychotic depression. However, when challenged to provide evidence of actually conducting her experiment, she could not.&lt;ref name=APA_Moran&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moran |first=Mark |title=Writer Ignites Firestorm With Misdiagnosis Claims |journal=Psychiatric News |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=10–12 |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]| location =| date=7 April 2006 |url= http://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176%2Fpn.41.7.0010 |issn=1559-1255 |doi=|id= |accessdate=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[BBC]]'s [[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]] science program performed a somewhat related experiment over two episodes entitled "How Mad Are You?". The experiment involved ten subjects, five with previously diagnosed mental health conditions, and five with no such diagnosis. They were observed by three experts in mental health diagnoses and their challenge was to identify the five with mental health problems solely from their behavior, without speaking to the subjects or learning anything of their histories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120719115647/http://www.bbc.co.uk/headroom/tv_and_radio/horizon_hmay.shtml ''BBC Headroom Horizon: How Mad Are You?'']&lt;/ref&gt; The experts correctly diagnosed two of the ten patients, misdiagnosed one patient, and incorrectly identified two healthy patients as having mental health problems. Unlike the other experiments listed here, however, the aim of this experiment was not to criticize the diagnostic process, but to minimize the stigmatization of the mentally ill. It aimed to illustrate that people with a previous diagnosis of a mental illness could live normal lives with their health problems not obvious to observers from their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spotlightradio.net/listen/how-mad-are-you/ How Mad Are You? - Spotlight] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702104558/http://www.spotlightradio.net/listen/how-mad-are-you/ |date=July 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7030">'''&lt;big&gt;Rural management&lt;/big&gt;''' is the study of planning, organising, directing, and controlling of [[rural area]],  [[Cooperative|co-operatives]], [[agribusiness]] and allied fields. It merges the knowledge of [[Management|management studies]] and applying it in the rural context. Most of the courses are designed  in such a way that the concepts taught in the class is applied in the real life through training in the rural areas through [[Case study|case-studies]] and interaction with the rural people

== Rural Management Institutes in India ==

There are many academic institutions within India  offering courses on Rural Management.  Notable among them are Institute of Rural Management, Anand (www.irma.ac.in), KIIT School of Rural Management (KSRM), Bhubaneswar (ksrm.ac.in) and Xavier University, Bhubaneswar (ximb.ac.in).  They offer either two years' Post Graduate Diploma in Rural Management or Two Years' Masters in Business Administration (MBA-Rural Management).

Rural Management graduates work in the areas like sustainable rural livelihoods, agri-business management, cooperatives, climate change, micro-finance, [[corporate social responsibility]], [[Natural resource management|natural resources managemen]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t, rural marketing, commodity trading and marketing and  [[social entrepreneurship]].

Apart from the classroom based courses, IRMA and KSRM provide opportunities to their rural management students to undergo three field segments (internships) of 10–11 weeks duration. In other words, the curriculum is designed to make it contextual to develop rural areas through experiential learning, live projects.

== Growing scope of Rural Management in India ==
India has close to 4,000 management schools that produce over 300,000 graduates every year. But the country has  few niche management schools focusing on the rural sector. Rural management schools  produce less than 1,000  rural managers. The small number is surprising considering the importance of the rural sector, or Bharat, in India's economy.

According to a study by global consulting firm Accenture, the rural economy accounts for 50 per cent of the country's gross domestic product. It also makes up 70 per cent of the country's population and 50 per cent of the work force. About 75 percent of new factories built in the past decade have come up in rural India, which accounts for 75 per cent of all new manufacturing jobs. Since 2000, per capita GDP has grown at 6.2 per cent a year in rural India compared with 4.2 per cent in urban areas. And in terms of spending, Bharat has trumped India by a mile. Between 2009 and 2012, Indians in the countryside spent $69 billion compared with $55 billion in big towns and cities.

Harish Manwani, chairman of Hindustan Unilever Ltd, says rural India is a powerhouse with the potential to add $1.8 trillion, or the equivalent of the current GDP, to the country's economy. But this potential can be realised only if Bharat and India merge.

Mainstream management schools have not ventured into rural management for many reasons. The rural management courses are very niche and they call for students with a different set of attitudes. The teaching approach is also different. Most mainstream schools may not be prepared to handle such subjects," says Professor Abraham Koshy, professor of marketing at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.  Experts say there is room for more rural management schools. For a country of India's size and the number of problems we face, there is a need for lot more such institutions. There is a  need to create a lot of rural managers who are potential agents of change.

Rural Management is one such specialisation which gives you the chance to contribute towards uplifting and betterment of those sections of the society, where the light of development is yet to reach. The purpose of the rural managers is to promote sustainable, eco-friendly and equitable socioeconomic development of rural area  through professional management of their institutions and organisations. Previously, only a few people opted for this challenging course but nowadays, a lot of students are opting for this course of rural management as they want to learn and showcase their skills to ensure that the performance in the rural sector is enhanced..

== Unique areas of Rural Management in terms of course and career ==
The MBA (Rural Management) programme is unique in the sense that in addition to traditional management courses such as Project Management, Accounting, Quantitative Techniques, Managerial Analysis and Communication, Finance, Marketing Management, many specialised courses focusing on management of rural sector are offered.

Agribusiness Management, Rural Production and Livelihoods, Rural Finance and Commercial Banking, Natural Resources Management and Climate Change, Rural Marketing, CSR Management, Micro Finance, ICTs for Development, Innovation in Rural Development and Enterprises, Policy and Programme Interventions in Rural Development are some of the courses especially focusing on the rural sector.

Anyone who completes MBA (Rural Management) has the advantage of having career opportunities in any general management area.  In addition to that, Rural Management graduates alone are preferred in specific areas mentioned above.

'''Sarva Shiksha  Abhiyan''' ([[Hindi]]: सर्व शिक्षा अभियान, ''Sarva Shikshā Abhiyān'', [[English language|English]]: '''Education for All Movement'''), or '''SSA''', is an [[Government of India|Indian Government]] programme aimed at the universalisation of [[elementary education]] "in a time bound manner", as mandated by the 86th Amendment to the [[Constitution of India]] making free and  compulsory education to children between the ages of 6 to 14 (estimated to be 205 million children in 2001) a [[Fundamental Rights in India|fundamental right]]. The programme was pioneered by former Indian [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]].

==History==
As an intervention programme, it started on 2002 and SSA has been operational since 2000-2001.&lt;ref name=SSA-MHRD&gt;{{cite web|title=Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan|url=http://mhrd.gov.in/schemes|publisher=Department of School Education and Literacy, MHRD, Government of india of India|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its roots go back to 1993-1994, when the District Primary Education Programme (DPEP) was launched, with an aim of achieving the objective of universal primary education.&lt;ref name=DPEP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://india.gov.in/my-government/schemes/district-primary-education-programme-dpep |title=District Primary Education Programme, DPEP |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029174118/http://india.gov.in/my-government/schemes/district-primary-education-programme-dpep |archivedate=29 October 2013 |accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; DPEP, over several phases, covered 272 districts in 18 states of the country.&lt;ref name=DPEP-EFA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.educationforallinindia.com/page81.html |title=District Primary Education Programmes (DPEP) |accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expenditure on the programme was shared by the Central Government (85%) and the State Governments. The Central share was funded by a number of external agencies, including the [[World Bank]], Department for International Development            (DFID) and [[UNICEF]].&lt;ref name=Jalan&gt;{{cite web |last=Jalan |first=Jyotsna |last2=Glinskaya |first2=Elena |title=Improving Primary School Education in India: An Impact Assessment of DPEP I |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTISPMA/Resources/Training-Events-and-Materials/india_primaryschool.pdf |format=PDF |website=World Bank |accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2001, more than $1500 million had been committed to the programme, and 50 million children covered in its ambit. In an impact assessment of Phase I of DPEP, the authors concluded that its net impact on minority children was impressive, while there was little evidence of any impact on the enrolment of girls. Nevertheless, they concluded that the investment in DPEP was not a waste, because it introduced a new approach to primary school interventions in India.&lt;ref name=Jalan /&gt;

The [[Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act|Right to Education Act]] (RTE) came into force on 1 April 2010. Some educationists and policy makers believe that, with the passing of this act, SSA has acquired the necessary legal force for its implementation.&lt;ref name=TOI-RTE&gt;{{cite news |date=5 April 2010 |title=Will RTE fulfil the SSA dream? |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Will-RTE-fulfil-the-SSA-dream/articleshow/5761551.cms |newspaper=The Times of India |accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funds==
In  2011-12, the [[Government of India]] allocated {{Indian Rupee|21000}} crore for this project.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Rasheeda Bhagat A poor country, rich in corruption|url=http://thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/rasheeda-bhagat/a-poor-country-rich-in-corruption/article2337095.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) is a programme for Universal Elementary Education. This programme is also an attempt to provide an opportunity for improving human capabilities to all children through provision of community -owned quality education in a mission mode. It is a response to the demand for quality basic education all over the country.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat==
''Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat'' is a nationwide sub-programme of ''Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat |url=http://ssa.nic.in/pabminutes-documents/Padhe%20Bharat%20Badhe%20Bharat.pdf |format=PDF |website=ssa.nic.in |accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pandey |first=Navadha |date=26 August 2014 |title=Smriti Irani launches Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat programme |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/industry-and-economy/education/smriti-irani-launches-padhe-bharat-badhe-bharat-programme/article6353330.ece |newspaper=Business Line |accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children who fail to read in early education lag behind in other subjects.The	programme is designed to	improve	comprehensive early reading,	writing and early mathematics programme	for children in Classes I and II. Under this programme, {{INRConvert|762|c}} was approved to States. The programme will not only provide print rich environment, timely distribution of books but will also include new teacher mentoring and appraisal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Government Schemes 2014-As a follow up to the foundational programme, in 2015-16 a programme called the National Reading Initiative was launched to develop and promote the habit of reading among students in elementary schools, thereby extending the programme up to class 8. States were provided token funds to plan and implement innovative activities to promote reading. States have designed specific interventions targeting children in classes 1 and 2 to improve learning outcomes. There are a variety of focussed programmes being currently implemented across the country.15|url=http://justwiki.net/New_Government_Schemes_2014-15#Padhe_Bharat_Badhe_Bharat|website=justwiki.net|accessdate= 15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2015}}
SSA has been operational since 2000-2001 to provide for a variety of interventions for universal access and retention, bridging of gender and social category gaps in elementary education and improving the quality of learning. SSA interventions include inter alia, opening of new schools and alternate schooling facilities, construction of schools and additional classrooms, toilets and drinking water, provisioning for teachers, regular teacher in service training and academic resource support, free textbooks&amp; uniforms and support for improving learning achievement levels / outcome. With the passage of the RTE Act, changes have been incorporated into the SSA approach, strategies and norms. The changes encompass the vision and approach to elementary education, guided by the following principles :
Holistic view of education, as interpreted in the National Curriculum Framework 2005, with implications for a systemic revamp of the entire content and process of education with significant implications for curriculum, teacher education, educational planning and management.
Equity, to mean not only equal opportunity, but also creation of conditions in which the disadvantaged sections of the society – children of SC, ST, Muslim minority, landless agricultural workers and children with special needs, etc. – can avail of the opportunity.
Access, not to be confined to ensuring that a school becomes accessible to all children within specified distance but implies an understanding of the educational needs and predicament of the traditionally excluded categories – the SC, ST and others sections of the most disadvantaged groups, the Muslim minority, girls in general, and children with special needs.
Gender concern, implying not only an effort to enable girls to keep pace with boys but to view education in the perspective spelt out in the National Policy on Education 1986 /92; i.e. a decisive intervention to bring about a basic change in the status of women.
Centrality of teacher, to motivate them to innovate and create a culture in the classroom, and beyond the classroom, that might produce an inclusive environment for children, especially for girls from oppressed and marginalised backgrounds.
Moral compulsion is imposed through the RTE Act on parents, teachers, educational administrators and other stakeholders, rather than shifting emphasis on punitive processes.
Convergent and integrated system of educational management is pre-requisite for implementation of the RTE law. All states must move in that direction as speedily as feasible{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Provide quality elementary education including life skills with a special focus on the education of girls and children with special needs as well as computer education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ssa.nic.in/ |title=Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan |website=Ministry of Human Resource Development |accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other similar initiatives by NGOs==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
There are several Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), which are also progressively working in the direction of the upliftment of children, especially in the field of [[health]] and [[education]]. To name a few of these organizations, Partnering Hope Into Action Foundation ([[Phia Foundation]]), [[Center for Unfolding Learning Potentials-CULP]], [[Smile Foundation]], [[Pratham]], [[Project Nanhi Kali]], [[Relief India Trust]], [[Aashray Society]] and Reforms India, Plan India , Childhood Enhancement Through Training and Action (CHETNA) and the Qualiterate Movement.

==Integration==
In 2018, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan along with [[ Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan]]was launched to form [[Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=179528|title=Ministry of HRD launches ‘SamagraSiksha’ scheme for holistic development of school education

'''Sri Lanka Planetarium''' is a public [[planetarium]] located in [[Colombo]], Sri Lanka. It is the first and only planetarium in the country and maintained as an institute under the [[Ministry of Technology and Research|Ministry of Science, Technology and Research]].&lt;ref name="www.motr.gov.lk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.motr.gov.lk/index.php |title=INSTITUTIONS#Planetarium |work= |publisher=www.motr.gov.lk |accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Planetarium was established on 1 February 1965 by the State Engineering Corporation as a special feature for the Ceylon industrial exhibition held in Colombo same year.&lt;ref name="planetarium"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planetarium.gov.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=49&amp;Itemid=27&amp;lang=en |title=Our Planetarium |work= |publisher=www.planetarium.gov.lk |accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planetarium was designed by the chief engineer from the State Engineering Corporation of Ceylon, [[A.

'''Suppressed research in the Soviet Union''' refers to scientific fields which were banned in the Soviet Union. All humanities and social sciences were additionally tested for strict accordance with [[historical materialism]]. These tests were alleged to serve as a cover for political suppression of scientists who engaged in research labeled as "idealistic" or "bourgeois".&lt;ref name="Graham 2004"&gt;Loren R.

In several cases the consequences of ideological influences were dramatic. The suppression of research began during the [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] era and continued after his regime.&lt;ref&gt;Loren R. Graham, Science and philosophy in the Soviet Union. New York, 1972, https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=8979265&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain scientific fields in the Soviet Union were suppressed primarily after being labeled as ideologically suspect.&lt;ref name="Graham 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker 2002"&gt;Mark Walker (2002) Science and Ideology.

{{main|Lysenkoism|Pavlovian session}}
In the mid-1930s, the [[agronomist]] [[Trofim Lysenko]] started a campaign against [[genetics]]&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, P. S., and R. H. Richens. The New Genetics in the Soviet Union. Cambridge, U.K.: English School of Agriculture, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; and was supported by Stalin. If the field of genetics' connection to Nazis wasn't enough, [[Mendelian genetics]] particularly enraged Stalin due to its founder [[Gregor Mendel]]'s being a Catholic Christian [[priest]], a fact that flew in the face of the [[State atheism|Soviet Union's official atheism and antitheism]].&lt;ref name="George Sarton"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WmkbAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=genetics+Stalin+due+to+Mendel+priest&amp;dq=genetics+Stalin+due+to+Mendel+priest|title =Isis, Volume 37|publisher=History of Science Society, Académie internationale d'histoire des sciences|quote=The fact that Mendel was a priest has been similarly used to discredit his ideas.|accessdate = 2007-10-18|year=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charles Paton Blacker"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zvA9AAAAYAAJ&amp;q=genetics+Stalin+due+to+Mendel+priest&amp;dq=genetics+Stalin+due+to+Mendel+priest|title =Eugenics: Galton and After|publisher=Duckworth|year=1952|quote=Was not Mendel a priest ?

''"Lysenko won the support of Joseph Stalin, the ruthless Soviet dictator, and Mendel's rules were officially outlawed in the Soviet Union and the Eastern European Countries that it controlled at that time. Under Communism, the Mendel Museum in his monastery was closed."''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, the Soviet government organized the Joint Scientific Session of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]] and the [[USSR Academy of Medical Sciences]], the "[[Pavlovian session]]". Several prominent Soviet physiologists ([[L.A. Orbeli]], [[P.K. Anokhin]], [[A.D. Speransky]], [[I.S. Beritashvily]]) were attacked for deviating from Pavlov's teaching.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} As a consequence of the Pavlovian session, Soviet physiologists were forced to accept a dogmatic ideology; the quality of physiological research deteriorated and Soviet physiology excluded itself from the international scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;Windholz G (1997) 1950 Joint Scientific Session: Pavlovians as the accusers and the accused. J Hist Behav Sci 33: 61-81.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Soviet biologists heavily criticised Lysenko's theories and pseudo-scientific methods.

=== Cybernetics ===
[[Cybernetics]] was also outlawed as [[bourgeois pseudoscience]]. [[Norbert Wiener]]'s 1948 book [[Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine|''Cybernetics'']] was condemned and translated only in 1958. A 1954 edition of the ''Brief Philosophical Dictionary'' condemned cybernetics for "mechanistically equating processes in live nature, society and in technical systems, and thus standing against materialistic dialectics and modern scientific physiology developed by [[Ivan Pavlov]]".&lt;ref&gt;«Кибернетика», Краткий философский словарь под редакцией М. Розенталя и П. Юдина (издание 4, дополненное и исправленное, Государственное издательство политической литературы, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; (However this article was removed from the 1955 reprint of the dictionary.) After an initial period of doubts, Soviet cybernetics took root, but this early attitude hampered the development of [[computer science and engineering in the Soviet Union]].

=== History ===
{{main|Soviet historiography}}
Soviet [[historiography]] (the way in which history was and is written by scholars of the [[Soviet Union]]&lt;ref&gt;It is ''not'' the [[history of the Soviet Union]]. See [[Historiography#Defining historiography|definitions of historiography]] for more details.&lt;/ref&gt;) was significantly influenced by the [[censorship in the Soviet Union|strict control by the authorities]] aimed at [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|propaganda]] of [[communist ideology]] and [[Soviet power]].

Since the late 1930s, Soviet historiography treated the [[Party line (politics)|party line]] and reality as one and the same.&lt;ref name="Osipova"&gt;Taisia Osipova, ''Peasant rebellions: Origin, Scope, Design and Consequences'', in Vladimir N. Brovkin (ed.), ''The Bolsheviks in Russian Society: The Revolution and the Civil Wars'', Yale University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0-300-06706-2}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=S_x7Za0ffUsC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=Soviet+historiography&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=sLQVu-5a08U6TocJRNMV9EF5QJg Google Print, p.154-176]&lt;/ref&gt; As such, if it was a science, it was a science in service of a specific political and ideological agenda, commonly employing [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionism]].&lt;ref name="Markwick"&gt;Roger D. Markwick, Donald J. Raleigh, ''Rewriting History in Soviet Russia: The Politics of Revisionist Historiography'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2001, {{ISBN|0-333-79209-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vIsacMkj3uIC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=The+problems+of+Soviet+historiography+are+the+problems+of+our&amp;sig=kWeHOA7iqPjsU5QRyc95LE4jn90 Google Print, p.4-5]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, historic [[archive]]s were closed and [[original research]] was severely restricted. Historians were required to pepper their works with references – appropriate or not – to Stalin and other "Marxist-Leninist classics", and to pass judgment – as prescribed by the Party – on pre-revolution historic [[Russian people|Russian]] figures.&lt;ref name="keep"&gt;John L. H. Keep: ''A History of the Soviet Union 1945-1991: Last of the Empires'', pages 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

Many works of Western historians were forbidden or [[Censorship in the Soviet Union|censored]], many areas of history were also forbidden for research as, officially, they never happened.&lt;ref name="Ferro"&gt;[[Marc Ferro|Ferro, Marc]] (2003). ''The Use and Abuse of History: Or How the Past Is Taught to Children.'' London; New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-28592-6}}. See Chapters 8 ''Aspects and variations of Soviet history'' and 10 ''History in profile: Poland''.&lt;/ref&gt; Translations of foreign historiography were often produced in a truncated form, accompanied with extensive censorship and corrective footnotes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} For example, in the Russian 1976 translation of [[Basil Liddell Hart]]'s ''History of the Second World War'' [[Great Purge#Purge of the army|pre-war purges of Red Army officers]], the secret protocol to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], many details of the [[Winter War]], the [[occupation of Baltic states|occupation of the Baltic states]], the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]], Western [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] assistance to the Soviet Union during the war, many other Western Allies' efforts, the Soviet leadership's mistakes and failures, criticism of the Soviet Union and other content were censored out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The [[Katyn massacre]] was formally assigned to Nazi Germany but the subject was frequently concealed. [[Droughts and famines in Russia and the Soviet Union|Soviet famines]] were taboo. {{citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for these two claims|date=November 2018}}

===Linguistics===
At the beginning of Stalin's rule, the dominant figure in Soviet linguistics was [[Nikolai Yakovlevich Marr]], who argued that [[Japhetic theory (linguistics)|language is a class construction]] and that language structure is determined by the economic structure of society.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Stalin, who had previously written about language policy as People's Commissar for Nationalities, read a letter by [[Arnold Chikobava]] criticizing the theory. He "summoned Chikobava to a dinner that lasted from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. taking notes diligently."&lt;ref&gt;Montefiore. p.638, Phoenix, Reprinted paperback.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way he grasped enough of the underlying issues to oppose this simplistic Marxist formalism, ending Marr's ideological dominance over Soviet linguistics. Stalin's principal work in the field was a small essay, "''Marxism and Linguistic Questions.''"&lt;ref&gt;Joseph V. Stalin (1950-06-20). "Concerning Marxism in Linguistics", ''[[Pravda]]''. Available online as ''[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1950/jun/20.htm Marxism and Problems of Linguistics]'' including other articles and letters also published in ''Pravda'' soon after February 8 and July 4, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pedology ===
[[Pedology (children study)|Pedology]] was a popular area of research on the basis of numerous [[orphanage]]s created after the [[Russian Civil War]]. Soviet pedology was a combination of [[pedagogy]] and [[psychology]] of human development, that heavily relied on various tests. It was officially banned in 1936 after a special decree of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] "On Pedolodical Perversions in the [[Narkompros]] System" on July 4, 1936.

===Physics===
In the late 1940s, some areas of physics, especially [[quantum mechanics]] but also [[Special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], were also criticized on grounds of "[[idealism]]". Soviet physicists, such as K. V. Nikolskij and D. Blokhintzev, developed a version of the [[Ensemble Interpretation|statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics]], which was seen as more adhering to the principles of [[dialectical materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Olival Freire, Jr.]]: ''[http://anikov.myweb.uga.edu/intel/freire.pdf Marxism and the Quantum Controversy: Responding to Max Jammer's Question] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114050425/http://anikov.myweb.uga.edu/intel/freire.pdf |date=2012-11-14 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Péter Szegedi ''[http://hps.elte.hu/~szegedi/cikkek/coldw.doc Cold War and Interpretations in Quantum Mechanics]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, although initially planned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ethan Pollock|title=Stalin and the Soviet Science Wars|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8283.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702041858/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8283.html|archivedate=2010-07-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; this process did not go as far as defining an "ideologically correct" version of physics and purging those scientists who refused to conform to it, because this was recognized as potentially too harmful to the [[Soviet atomic bomb project|Soviet nuclear program]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
&lt;!-- See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysenkoism#Rise

Interestingly, perhaps the only opponents of Lysenkoism during Stalin's lifetime to escape liquidation came from the small community of Soviet [[Nuclear physics|nuclear physicists]]: as [[Tony Judt]] has observed, "It is significant that Stalin left his nuclear physicists alone and never presumed to second guess ''their'' calculations. Stalin may well have been mad but he was not stupid."&lt;ref name="Judt"&gt;Judt, Tony. ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945'', (New York: Penguin Books, 2006), p. 174n.&lt;/ref&gt;

--&gt;

=== Sociology ===
After the Russian Revolution, sociology was gradually "politicized, Bolshevisized and eventually, Stalinized".&lt;ref name=eaw8-9&gt;Elizabeth Ann Weinberg, ''The Development of Sociology in the Soviet Union'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1974, {{ISBN|0-7100-7876-5}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RXwOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;vq=sociology+disappeared&amp;dq=sociology+%22Soviet+Union%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 Google Print, p.8-9]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1930s to 1950s, the discipline virtually ceased to exist in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=eaw8-9/&gt; Even in the era where it was allowed to be practiced, and not replaced by [[Marxist philosophy]], it was always dominated by [[Marxism|Marxist thought]]; hence sociology in the Soviet Union and the entire Eastern Bloc represented, to a significant extent, only one branch of sociology: [[Marxist sociology]].&lt;ref name=eaw8-9/&gt; With the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] and the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Party Congress in 1956]], restrictions on sociological research were somewhat eased, and finally, after [[23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|the 23rd Party Congress in 1966]], sociology in Soviet Union was once again officially recognized as an acceptable branch of science.&lt;ref name=eaw11&gt;Elizabeth Ann Weinberg, ''The Development of Sociology in the Soviet Union'', p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statistics ===
 
&lt;small&gt;This is the translation of a widely cited article (''"Lukavaya Tsifra"'') by journalist [[Vasily Selyunin]] and economist [[Grigorii Khanin]], in ''[[Novy Mir]]'', February 1987, #2: 181-202&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Alan Smith, ''Russia and the World Economy: Problems of Integration'', Routledge, 1993, {{ISBN|0-415-08924-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MvfeV9AraAcC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=seliunin+khanin+1987&amp;source=web&amp;ots=JWWEudOI9y&amp;sig=o3bU0GkUyzRoQRDFRmUb2MYFzMA Google Print, p.34-35]&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality (accuracy and reliability) of data published in the Soviet Union and used in historical research is another issue raised by various [[Sovietologist]]s.&lt;ref name="Eberstadt"&gt;Nicholas Eberstadt and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, ''The Tyranny of Numbers: Mismeasurement and Misrule'', American EnterpriseInstitute, 1995, {{ISBN|0-8447-3764-X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HmAtKsSvI7gC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=reliability+of+Soviet+statistical+data&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=TTsMR7CrKIH87gKqvbnUAw&amp;sig=7n2AksALwSy8qoq3GSrGMHlugf0#PPA138,M1 Google Print, p.138-140]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reflections"&gt;[[Robert Conquest]] ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'' (2000) {{ISBN|0-393-04818-7}}, page 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hewett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dronin"/&gt; The Marxist theoreticians of the Party considered statistics as a [[social science]]; hence many applications of statistical mathematics were curtailed, particularly during the Stalin era.&lt;ref name="Salsburg"/&gt; Under [[central planning]], nothing could occur by accident.&lt;ref name="Salsburg"&gt;David S. Salsburg, ''The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century'', Owl Books, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8050-7134-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ej9xytYdkyAC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=lady+with+tea+soviet+statistics&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=6FwMR7-yPIP06wLAy6DUCQ&amp;sig=lFxEvOOxaGPB-mRsiVuhbJoENO8#PPA148,M1 Google Print, p.147-149]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Law of large numbers]] or the idea of [[standard deviation|random deviation]] were decreed as "false theories".&lt;ref name="Salsburg"/&gt; Statistical journals and university departments were closed; world-renowned statisticians like [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] or [[Eugen Slutsky]] abandoned statistical research.&lt;ref name="Salsburg"/&gt;

As with all Soviet historiography, reliability of Soviet statistical data varied from period to period.&lt;ref name="Dronin"&gt;Nikolai M. Dronin, Edward G. Bellinger, ''Climate Dependence And Food Problems In Russia, 1900-1990'', Central European
University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|963-7326-10-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9a5j_JL6cqIC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=reliability+of+Soviet+statistical+data&amp;ei=mToMR763CYjO6wKBpKTUCQ&amp;sig=-9g5jeJhFKQLKFAqx9SMGbD9Cgo#PPA16,M1 Google Print, p.15-16]&lt;/ref&gt; The first revolutionary decade and the period of Stalin's dictatorship both appear highly problematic with regards to statistical reliability; very little statistical data were published from 1936 to 1956 (''see'' [[Soviet Census (1937)]]).&lt;ref name="Dronin"/&gt; The reliability of data has improved after 1956 when some missing data was published and Soviet experts themselves published some adjusted data for the Stalin's era;&lt;ref name="Dronin"/&gt; however the quality of documentation has deteriorated.&lt;ref name="Hewett"/&gt;

While on occasion statistical data useful in historical research might have been completely ''invented'' by the Soviet authorities,&lt;ref name="reflections"/&gt; there is little evidence that most statistics were significantly affected by falsification or insertion of false data with the intent to confound the West.&lt;ref name="Hewett"&gt;Edward A. Hewett, ''Reforming the Soviet Economy: Equality Versus Efficiency'', Brookings Institution Press, 1988, {{ISBN|0-8157-3603-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gbs9EfaskngC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=reliability+of+Soviet+statistical+data&amp;ei=mToMR763CYjO6wKBpKTUCQ&amp;sig=lxCHiqGzZxlOXNHVQvtdiLc4Zic#PPA8,M1 Google Print, p.7] and following chapters&lt;/ref&gt; Data was however falsified both during collection – by local authorities who would be judged by the central authorities based on whether their figures reflected the [[central economy]] prescriptions – and by internal propaganda, with its goal to portray the Soviet state in most positive light to its very citizens.&lt;ref name="Eberstadt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dronin"/&gt; Nonetheless the policy of not publishing, or simply not collecting, data that was deemed unsuitable for various reasons was much more common than simple falsification; hence there are many gaps in Soviet statistical data.&lt;ref name="Hewett"/&gt; Inadequate or lacking documentation for much of Soviet statistical data is also a significant problem.&lt;ref name="Eberstadt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hewett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dronin"/&gt;

The '''Supreme Education Council''' ({{lang-ar|المجلس الأعلى للتعليم}}, abbreviated '''SEC''') is a [[Politics of Qatar|Qatari government]] [[government agency|agency]] responsible for [[education in Qatar]]. It was established in November 2002. It is responsible for overseeing and directing the education system in Qatar and, subsequently, all of the country's independent schools.&lt;ref name="worlddata"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/WDE/2010/pdf-versions/Qatar.pdf|title=World Data on Education - Qatar|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2015-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its founding, it replaced the [[Ministry of Education (Qatar)|Ministry of Education]], which has since had its responsibilities reduced to providing support for the country's private schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ies/article/viewFile/33720/22297|title=Alignment of Teacher-Developed Curricula and National Standards in Qatar’s National Education Reform|authors=Ramzi Nasser, Eman Zaki, Nancy Allen, Badria Al Mula, Fatma Al Mutawaha, Hessa Al Bin Ali &amp; Tricia Kerr|publisher=Canadian Center of Science and Education|year=2014|accessdate=2015-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Education's personnel were consolidated into the SEC in 2009.&lt;ref name="worlddata"/&gt;

==Organization==
The SEC is headed by Mohammad bin Abdul Wahed Al-Hammadi, minister of education,&lt;ref name="hammadi"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov.qa/En/Media/News/Pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=3700|title=Education Minister Issues Ministerial Decision for Services Provided by SEC|publisher=Supreme Education Council|date=6 July 2015|accessdate=2015-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hind bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the deputy minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov.qa/En/Media/News/Pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsId=3378|title=Supreme Education Council Celebrates International Teacher’s Day|publisher=Supreme Education Council|date=5 October 2013|accessdate=2015-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Departmental bodies ==
The SEC has ten departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov.qa/En/SECInstitutes/Pages/default.aspx|title=SEC Institutes|publisher=Supreme Education Council|accessdate=2015-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three most important are:&lt;ref name="worlddata"/&gt;
*The Education Institute – Is directly involved in the oversight and support of independent and semi-independent schools. It is responsible for developing curriculum standards and licensing private schools and pre-schools. It also prepares specialized development programmes for school administrators.
*The Evaluation Institute – Conducts national assessments of student learning of independent K-12 schools and collates the data. The institute is also responsible for teacher licensing. 
*The Higher Education Institute – Assists students in applying for colleges and provides assistance for international admission tests.

'''Trans Student Educational Resources''' ('''TSER''') is a [[United States]]-based organization that seeks to promote the wellbeing of [[transgender]] youth. It was founded in 2011 by activists [[Eli Erlick]] and Alex Sennello. It is the only national organization led by transgender youth.&lt;ref name="thestory.org"&gt;http://www.thestory.org/stories/2013-07/changing-gender-changing-school&lt;/ref&gt;

TSER provides resources to the public on how to support trans students, such as "safe schools" trainings for teachers, online infographics, and workshops at conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transstudent.org/services |title=Trans Student Educational Resources - What We Do |publisher=Transstudent.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cloudfront1"/&gt; It is most notable for its members' work in media focused on [[transgender]] educational justice.&lt;ref&gt;http://uprisingradio.org/home/2014/01/10/how-conservative-homophobic-forces-are-taking-aim-at-californias-new-law-supporting-transgender-students/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/2013/10/23/lgbt-students-can-face-long-road-to-financial-aid |title=LGBT Students Can Face Long Road to Financial Aid - US News and World Report |publisher=Usnews.com |date=2013-10-23 |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/11/transgender-discrimination-in-schools-my-story&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/dateline/story/about/id/601670/n/Crossover-Kids |title=SBS Dateline &amp;#124; Crossover Kids |publisher=Sbs.com.au |date=2013-04-30 |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
TSER's mission statement reads,

{{quote|Trans Student Educational Resources is a youth-led organization dedicated to transforming the educational environment for trans and gender nonconforming students through advocacy and empowerment. In addition to our focus on creating a more trans-friendly education system, our mission is to educate the public and teach trans activists how to be effective organizers. We believe that justice for trans and gender nonconforming youth is contingent on an intersectional framework of activism. Ending oppression is a long-term process that can only be achieved through collaborative action.&lt;ref&gt;http://transstudent.org/mission&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== History ==
Founded in 2011 by two 16-year-old [[trans women]], Trans Student Educational Resources began as an effort to start transgender policies in school districts in the United States and get more young trans people involved in activism. At that time, there were very few enumerated anti-discrimination policies in place around the country and there was a lack of visual resources on transgender issues. In 2012, TSER began its infographic series, which expanded its audience and member participation.&lt;ref name=story&gt;{{cite episode
| title = Changing Gender, Changing School
| url = http://www.thestory.org/stories/2013-07/changing-gender-changing-school
| series = The Story }}&lt;/ref&gt; TSER is also involved in the organizing of the annual [[Transgender Day of Visibility]] - a worldwide effort to raise promote the wellbeing of transgender people and to celebrate their successes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transstudent.org/tdov |title=Trans Student Educational Resources - Transgender Day of Visibility |publisher=Transstudent.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.com/social-affairs/20131105/california-transgender-students-have-new-law-but-still-face-old-struggles |title=California transgender students have new law but still face old struggles |publisher=Dailynews.com |date=2014-01-01 |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

In 2012, TSER began publishing transgender-related infographics. Following its success, the organization released dozens more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transstudent.org/graphics |title=Trans Student Educational Resources - Infographics |publisher=Transstudent.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to director Eli Erlick, TSER's graphics have been publicized by millions of blogs, web sites, and organizations and have been influential in educating the public on transgender issues.&lt;ref name="thestory.org"/&gt; TSER staff have focused on their mission statement of "advocacy and empowerment"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transstudent.org/mission |title=Trans Student Educational Resources - Mission Statement |publisher=Transstudent.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; through speaking at conferences&lt;ref name="cloudfront1"&gt;http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/lifeworks/pages/119/attachments/original/1381951907/MOP_FINAL_PROGRAM.pdf?1381951907&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.genderspectrum.org/images/stories/pdf/2013gspwprogram.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and providing information to those that need it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transstudent.org/services |title=Trans Student Educational Resources - What We Do |publisher=Transstudent.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TSER also engages in trans youth [[leadership development]], trainings for organizations, teachers, and students, media advocacy, and the creation of a scholarship program for trans students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advocate.com/youth/2014/11/19/meet-trans-teen-who-just-won-25k-make-schools-trans-inclusive&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/segment/on-campus-how-schools-can-be-transgender-friendly/530ea86d78c90a37660001bb&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://transstudent.org/services&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, multiple members of TSER advocated in media for trans-inclusivity at [[women's colleges]].&lt;ref&gt;http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/segment/smith-college-calliope-wong-lgbt-application-admission-trans/514a168f78c90a236b0000e7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bigstory.ap.org/article/womens-colleges-address-transgender-applicants&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Gender Unicorn ==

TSER created the Gender Unicorn&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transstudent.org/gender&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014 to describe the spectrums of gender and sexuality. It was quickly picked up by schools, colleges, and universities across the world and has been translated into over a dozen languages. 

In 2016 it was heavily criticized by conservative [[Evangelical]] Christians for being used in K-12 schools, leading to protests in Charlotte, North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;https://thinkprogress.org/conservatives-are-really-scared-of-this-purple-gender-unicorn-c0436d2a427a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dailycaller.com/2016/08/10/new-school-gender-unicorn-sparks-parental-outrage/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Gender Unicorn was discussed in the [[Senate of Canada]] during debate regarding [[Bill C-16]].&lt;ref&gt;https://news.vice.com/story/jordan-peterson-testifies-against-bill-c-16-in-the-senate&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://torontoist.com/2017/05/room-jordan-peterson-senators-debated-human-rights/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==

In 2014, the organization changed its name from Trans Student Equality Resources to Trans Student Educational Resources, citing that [[equal opportunity|equality]] is "not enough" for the transgender community.&lt;ref&gt;http://transstudent.org/ourname&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trinidad María Enríquez''' (5 June 1846-20 April 1891) was a [[Peruvians|Peruvian]] teacher and student. After completing the only education available to her, she founded a school to teach other girls and complete the necessary requirements to enter university. Appealing to the president, she was granted the right to attend if an examination proved she was adequately prepared. Passing her review, 
Enríquez completed courses at the [[National University of Saint Anthony the Abbot in Cuzco]], becoming the first Peruvian woman to earn a university degree in 1878. Though she graduated, she was denied a license to practice law and fought her case through the legislature and court systems until her death in 1891.

==Early life==
Trinidad María Josefa Enríquez Ladrón de Guevara was born on 5 June 1846 in [[Cusco]], Peru to Cecilia Ladrón de Guevara y Castilla and Marcelino Enríquez. Her parents were well to do{{sfn|Vargas Sifuentes|2017}}{{sfn|Vilchez Izquierdo|2006}} and on her mother's side of the family, she descended from [[Túpac Amaru]] and his son [[Túpac Amaru II]], per historian Horacio Villanueva Urteaga.{{sfn|Letona|2012}}{{sfn|Tamariz Lúcar|2016}} She enrolled at ''El Colegio de señoritas "Educandas"'' (The Educandas Preparatory School for Girls) and excelled at her studies.{{sfn|Vargas Sifuentes|2017}} At the time, there were no higher education opportunities for women and there were no schools offering a complete high school education for the final two years of study.{{sfn|Letona|2012}}{{sfn|Tamariz Lúcar|2016}} Custom decreed that women were destined to become wives and mothers. The only training offered was restricted to upper class women and focused on preparing them with light reading, sewing and music to take their place in society.{{sfn|Valladares Chamorro|2012|p=107}}

==Career==
By the age of eleven, Enríquez was teaching geography courses at Educandas. She founded a women's school, known as the ''Colegio Superior para Mujeres'' (High School for Women), on 1 June 1870. Included in her curricula were courses to prepare her to take the university entrance examinations, like analytical reading, arithmetic, Castilian grammar and lexicography, hygiene, and universal history, among others.{{sfn|Vargas Sifuentes|2017}} Enríquez based the courses she offered on the requirements needed to attain entrance to university.{{sfn|Tamariz Lúcar|2016}} Society was divided upon whether such education was necessary for women and after three years, she was forced to close the school.{{sfn|Vargas Sifuentes|2017}} 

Wanting to pursue higher education and become a lawyer, Enríquez applied for the university, after obtaining a governmental decree allowing her to take the entrance examinations. The decree, issued on 3 October 1874 required that her independent study for two years at her own school be validated, and if found acceptable, authorized her to enter any national university.{{sfn|Vargas Sifuentes|2017}}{{sfn|Tamariz Lúcar|2016}} From 20 to 29 April 1875, she was examined by a jury to determine her preparedness.{{sfn|Letona|2012}} The evaluations were published and much commented upon in the regional newspapers, but Enríquez was given high marks in the tests and allowed to enter university.{{sfn|Vargas Sifuentes|2017}} She enrolled in the [[National University of Saint Anthony the Abbot in Cuzco]]{{sfn|Vilchez Izquierdo|2006}}{{sfn|LaGreca|2009|p=91}} and graduated in 1878 with a bachelor's degree in [[jurisprudence]], as the first woman university graduate in the country.{{sfn|Vargas Sifuentes|2017}}{{sfn|Letona|2012}}

Forbidden by law to receive a license as an attorney, Enríquez appealed to the [[Congress of the Republic of Peru|Peruvian Congress]] and the [[Judiciary of Peru|Judiciary]]. Though [[Mariano Felipe Paz Soldán]], the [[Ministry of Justice and Human Rights (Peru)|Minister of Justice and Instruction]] was in favor of allowing women to enter the profession, others were not.{{sfn|Vargas Sifuentes|2017}} The advent of the [[War of the Pacific]] in 1879, prevented the legislature from considering her request.{{sfn|Valladares Chamorro|2012|p=106}} On 5 October 1881, President [[Nicolás de Piérola]] issued a presidential authorization to allow Enríquez admission to the bar. She rejected the exception, on the basis that the law should allow any woman equal access to become a lawyer.{{sfn|Vargas Sifuentes|2017}} After the war ended, the legislature took up Enríquez request again and after consulting with the [[Superior Courts of Justice of Peru|Superior Courts of Justice in Lima]] denied her request in 1886.{{sfn|Valladares Chamorro|2012|p=106}}

In 1870, Enríquez had founded the Artisan Society of Cusco, which operated a night school for workers, teaching them to read and write and educating them about their rights under the law. She also founded and edited the journal ''La voz del Cusco'' (The Voice of Cusco), which was focused on issues effecting women and wokers.{{sfn|Vargas Sifuentes|2017}}{{sfn|Tamariz Lúcar|2016}} The final decision of the courts on Lima was issued in 1891, by prosecutor Ricardo Espinoza, who denied the license on the basis that women lacked the physical strength and mental capacity to serve as professionals and that by granting them the rights to do so, they would become masculine.{{sfn|Valladares Chamorro|2012|p=110}}

==Death and legacy==
Enríquez died on 20 April 1891 in Lima, from [[brain fever]] and was buried at the [[Cementerio de la Almudena]] in Cusco.{{sfn|Vargas Sifuentes|2017}} Enríquez persistence to enter university inspired other women and by 1908 a dozen other women had been allowed to enter university;{{sfn|Valladares Chamorro|2012|p=112}} however, the law faculty did not enroll another woman until 1913, when Rosa Pérez Liendo was allowed to begin her studies.{{sfn|Valladares Chamorro|2012|p=113}} In 1914, her portrait was hung in the main hall of the National University of Saint Anthony the Abbot.{{sfn|Vilchez Izquierdo|2006}} In 2005, Tania Gutiérrez Samanez published a biography ''Trinidad María Enríquez'' detailing her life{{sfn|Letona|2012}} and ''Trinidad María Enríquez, una abogada en los Andes'' (Trinidad María Enríquez, an attorney in the Andes) was published by Carlos Ramos Núñez and Martín Baigorria Castillo.{{sfn|Vilchez Izquierdo|2006}}
