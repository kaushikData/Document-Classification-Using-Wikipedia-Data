==Construction and history==
It was conceived and planned in 1981, with the passage of a student referendum authorizing an assessment of $23 per student per quarter as of winter 1987. It opened January 8, 1987 with UCI Men’s Basketball vs. Utah State. Parkin Architects Limited served as the architects for the building, which was renamed "Donald Bren Events Center" in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Timelines: 1980&amp;ndash;1989 |date= |work=UC Irvine Anteater Chronicles |url=http://www.lib.uci.edu/ucihistory/index.php?page=timelines&amp;function=get&amp;decade=1980 |accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[University of California, Irvine]] renamed the structure in honor of real estate mogul and chairman of the [[Irvine Company]], [[Donald Bren]], upon receipt of a $1.5 million donation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Timelines: 1980&amp;ndash;1989 |date= |work=UC Irvine Anteater Chronicles |url=http://www.lib.uci.edu/ucihistory/index.php?page=timelines&amp;function=get&amp;decade=1980 |accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15604">[[Image:Stanley Cup no background.png|thumb|180px|The [[Stanley Cup]].]] 
The '''Curse of 1940''', also called '''Dutton's Curse''', was a [[sports-related curses|superstitious explanation]] for why the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL)'s [[New York Rangers]] did not win the league's championship trophy, the [[Stanley Cup]], from 1940 through 1994.

==Popular theories==
The Rangers began play in the {{NHL Year|1926}} season and won a division title in their first season of existence and a Stanley Cup against the [[Montreal Maroons]] in their second. They would win two more Cups in {{NHL Year|1932}} and {{NHL Year|1939}}, defeating the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] both times.

During the {{NHL Year|1939}} season, the mortgage on the Rangers' home arena, [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|the third Madison Square Garden]] (built in 1925), was paid off.  Hence, the management of the Madison Square Garden Corporation symbolically burned the mortgage in the bowl of the Cup. This led some hockey fans to believe that the Cup, which is regarded almost as a sacred object, had been "desecrated", leading the "hockey gods" to place a curse on the Rangers.&lt;ref name="msg-mortgage"&gt;{{cite book |first= Dan |last=Diamond |first2=James|last2=Duplacey|author3=Eric Zweig |year=2001 |title=Hockey Stories On And Off The Ice |publisher=Andrews McMeel |location= Kansas City |isbn=0-7407-1903-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory is that the supposed curse came from [[Red Dutton]], the coach and general manager of the [[New York Americans]], for whom he had once played. The Amerks were actually the first NHL team to play in New York City, beginning play as soon as the Garden opened for the {{NHL Year|1925}} season. However, their original owner, [[rum-running|bootlegger]] [[Bill Dwyer (gangster)|Bill Dwyer]], found the going difficult with the end of [[Prohibition]], and the NHL took over ownership of the team in 1937. They made five playoff appearances, including a quarterfinal loss to the Rangers in {{NHL Year|1928}} and a quarterfinal win over the Rangers in {{NHL Year|1937}}. However, after beating the Rangers, the Americans fell to the eventual Stanley Cup champion [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] in the 1938 semifinals, the closest they ever came to winning the Cup.

Following the {{NHL Year|1941}} season, many NHL players entered the armed forces to fight in World War II. This hurt the Americans more than the other teams, and so Dutton announced his team would suspend operations for the duration of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Red Dutton: tempestuous star bailed out Amerks|last=Frayne|first=Trent|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=March 31, 1987|page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named NHL President upon the death of [[Frank Calder]] in 1943, a post he held until 1946, when he resigned and was replaced by [[Clarence Campbell]].&lt;ref name="Dutton"/&gt;

Dutton had resigned the league presidency with the intention of reviving the Americans. However, the league, with the encouragement of Garden management, reneged on a longstanding promise to allow the Americans to return. A bitter Dutton declared that the Rangers would never win the Cup for as long as he lived. He died in 1987 at 88.&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;{{cite news|title=NHL president and hockey star Red Dutton dies|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=March 16, 1987|page=D5}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the Rangers were in their 47th season without having won the Cup.

The Curse of 1940 "worked" in several ways, some of them odd. The Madison Square Garden Corporation found it could make more money when [[Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus]] came to town in the spring. This forced the Rangers, and later the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA)'s [[New York Knicks]], to use different arenas at the worst possible time—during their respective leagues' playoffs. At the time, it was impossible to configure arenas in a way that would allow a circus and a hockey or basketball game to take place on the same day. Hence, the Rangers used [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in [[Toronto]] as their "home ice" in the [[1950 Stanley Cup Finals]], a move that potentially cost the Rangers that year's Stanley Cup. After the Blueshirts took a 3–2 series lead on the [[Detroit Red Wings]], the NHL cited an obscure rule stating that the deciding game in a Stanley Cup Final could not be played on neutral ice. Maple Leaf Gardens was labelled "neutral" because its tenants proper were the Leafs, and Madison Square Garden was still occupied by the circus at the time. The [[Detroit Olympia]] was thus the venue for the sixth (although the Rangers were to be designated the "home" team for that match) and seventh games, both of which were won by Detroit.

Also, while Dutton was the league president, he oversaw a [[1943–44 New York Rangers season|1943–44 Rangers team]] that inherited the title the Americans left behind upon their folding of hardest-hit NHL team by World War II. The Rangers asked the NHL for permission to fold until the end of the war because of their best players' service in the armed forces overseas, but the league refused the Rangers' request, and so they finished well back of the other five teams that year. Notably, career minor-league goaltender [[Ken McAuley]] gave up 310 goals in the team's 50 games, a league record for worst goals-against-average (6.2 goals/game) that has stood since. (The closest any goalie since has come to equalling this record is [[Greg Millen]], who allowed 282 goals in 60 games for the [[Hartford Whalers]] [[1982–83 NHL season|forty seasons later]]).

League corruption and favoritism through the entire [[Original Six]] era was also a factor in the Rangers' futility. [[James E. Norris]], the owner of the [[Detroit Red Wings]], at one point also owned controlling stakes in both the Rangers and the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], allowing him to stack the best players onto the Red Wings. This continued after the elder Norris' death, as his two sons, [[James D. Norris|James D.]] and [[Bruce Norris (ice hockey)|Bruce Norris]], continued to control the three teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1070137/index.htm |date=1959-02-02 |title=Black Hawks On The Wing |first=Robert H. |last=Boyle |accessdate=2008-04-25 |work=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220080154/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1070137/index.htm |archivedate=2009-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during this time, the NHL still held territorial drafts, in which teams would get first rights to players who played junior hockey within a 50-mile radius of the home stadium; this gave Toronto, Detroit and [[Montreal Canadiens|Montreal]] significant recruiting advantages, since the areas around those cities were far more developed in their junior hockey programs than those further from the Canada–US border, including the Rangers.

==The Islanders==
{{further|New York Islanders|1950 Stanley Cup Finals|1972 Stanley Cup Finals|1979 Stanley Cup Finals}}
The Rangers struggled for several years after World War II; after their 1950 Finals appearance they only made the playoffs six times in 17 seasons. In [[1971–72 NHL season|1972]], they reached the [[1972 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] for the first time in 22 years, but lost to the [[Boston Bruins]], who were led by [[Bobby Orr]] and [[Phil Esposito]]. The next season began with the founding of an expansion team playing on [[Long Island]], the [[New York Islanders]]. In [[1974–75 NHL season|1975]], the Islanders qualified for the playoffs for the first time and defeated the Rangers. The two teams squared off again in [[1978–79 NHL season|1979]], a series the Rangers won. They went on to lose the [[1979 Stanley Cup Finals|Cup Finals]] to the [[Montreal Canadiens]], who won their fourth Stanley Cup in a row.

The Islanders won the Stanley Cup for the first time in {{scfy|1980}}, beginning their own streak of four consecutive championships; their {{scfy|1983}} title capped off their 11th season and the team surpassed the then-57-year-old Rangers for total Cups won. During the Islanders' second Cup run, in {{scfy|1981}}, the Islanders swept the Rangers in the second round. During that series, fans of the younger franchise taunted the Rangers by chanting "1940!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Austin|date=June 13, 1994|title=Closing In|journal=[[Sports Illustrated]]|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1994/06/13/131303/closing-in-the-new-york-rangers-drew-nearer-to-their-goal-of-winning-the-stanley-cup-by-taking-a-2-1-series-lead-over-vancouver}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans in other NHL cities soon picked up the chant. It was also in the 1980s that the idea of a "Curse of 1940" began to take hold, with Red Dutton's death in 1987 and the occasional publication of the photograph of the Garden mortgage being burned in the Cup's bowl (the third Garden was demolished after the Rangers and Knicks moved into the [[Madison Square Garden|current Garden]] in 1968). Also, in [[1982–83 NHL season|1982]], the [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)|Colorado Rockies]] moved to suburban [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]] and became the [[New Jersey Devils]], giving the Rangers a second rival in the [[New York metropolitan area]].

In {{NHL Year|1991}}, the Rangers finished with the best overall record in the NHL, earning them their first of three [[Presidents' Trophy|Presidents' Trophies]], but they lost to the [[1991 Stanley Cup Finals|defending Cup champion]] (and eventual [[1992 Stanley Cup Finals|repeat champions]]) [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in the [[Patrick Division]] Finals. Although the Penguins were defending champions, and their victory was hardly a shocking one, an odd moment came Pittsburgh forward [[Ron Francis]] took a shot from the blue line that beat Rangers goaltender [[Mike Richter]]. The next season, with hopes high, the Rangers finished last in the Patrick Division, largely because of an injury to their star defenseman [[Brian Leetch]]. In the kind of incident many fans ascribe to curses, Leetch arrived at the Garden in a taxi, stepped out, and broke his ankle when he slipped on a patch of ice, a most ironic injury for a hockey player.

==End of the Curse==
{{further|1993–94 New York Rangers season|1994 Stanley Cup Finals}}
By {{NHL Year|1993}}, the Rangers had not won the Stanley Cup in 54 years. In that time, championships had been won in the New York area by the Islanders (4), the [[New York Yankees]] (14), the [[New York Mets]] (2), the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] baseball team (1 prior to the franchise's move to San Francisco in 1958), the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] (1 prior to the franchise's move to Los Angeles in 1958), the [[New York Giants]] football team (4), the [[New York Jets]] (1), the [[New York Knicks]] (two [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] titles) and the [[New Jersey Nets]] (2 [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] titles, playing as the New York Nets). All five of the other [[Original Six]] teams won [[Stanley Cup]]s since 1940: the Canadiens 20 times, the Maple Leafs 10 times, the Red Wings 5 times, the Bruins 3 times, and the Black Hawks once.

The Rangers stormed through the 1993–94 regular season, scoring 112 points en route to clinching their second Presidents' Trophy in three years. They swept aside the Islanders in the first round of the playoffs and defeated the [[Washington Capitals]] in five games in the second round before meeting the Devils (whom they had beaten in the 1992 Patrick Division Semifinals) in the Eastern Conference Finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanley Cup Playoffs Flashback: May 14, 1994 Eve of epic conference finals series vs. Devils was 15 years ago today|date=May 14, 2009|accessdate=February 21, 2012|first=Jim|last=Cerny|work=newyorkrangers.com|publisher=Rangers.NHL.com|url=http://rangers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=493950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devils fans had picked up the "1940!" chant and the curse myth from Islander fans, and curiously, the hockey [[seating capacity]] of the Devils' home arena, the [[Brendan Byrne Arena]] (later renamed the Continental Airlines Arena and then Izod Center), was 19,040. With the Rangers trailing the series three games to two and facing elimination, it looked as though the curse was at work again. However, Rangers captain [[Mark Messier]] challenged the New York media by "guaranteeing" his team would win Game 6: "We know we're going in there to win Game 6 and bringing it back for Game 7. We feel we can win it and we feel we are going to win it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/columns/newsmakers/mark_messier060112.html|title=Honouring No. 11: The Oilers Pay Tribute to Hockey's Ultimate Leader|date=2006-01-12|accessdate=2008-03-14|publisher=CBC Sports|last=Care|first=Tony|first2=Rob|last2=Sinclair}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Post]]'' and ''[[New York Daily News]]'' both carried back pages offering Messier's guarantee: "We'll Win Tonight." Ranger coach [[Mike Keenan]] said of the guarantee: "Mark was sending a message to his teammates that he believed together we could win. He put on an amazing performance to make sure it happened."&lt;ref name="Morrison"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hockey Night in Canada: My Greatest Day|first=Scott|last=Morrison|authorlink=Scott Morrison (journalist)|location=Toronto|publisher=Key Porter Books|year=2008|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rangers fell behind 2–0, but trailing 2–1 in the third period, Messier scored a [[natural hat trick]] (three straight goals) to make good on his guarantee and force a deciding seventh game.&lt;ref name="Morrison"/&gt; The curse threatened again in Game 7 as the Rangers led 1–0 and looked as though they were about to advance to the Cup Finals when New Jersey's [[Valeri Zelepukin]] scored with 7.7 seconds remaining in regulation to tie the game.&lt;ref name=1994Game7/&gt; But in the second overtime, [[Stéphane Matteau]] scored to give the Rangers the game and the series.&lt;ref name="Morrison"/&gt;&lt;ref name=1994Game7&gt;{{cite news|title=2 Overtimes Later, It's a Final and It's the Rangers|last=LaPointe|first=Joe|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 28, 1994|page=27|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/28/sports/hockey-2-overtimes-later-it-s-a-final-and-it-s-the-rangers.html?pagewanted=print&amp;src=pm|accessdate=June 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rangers moved on to the [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] against the [[Vancouver Canucks]] and took a 3–2 lead late in the third period of the deciding seventh game. They shot the puck down the length of the ice with seven seconds left. Thinking the game was over, the Rangers poured onto the ice in celebration. However, the Canucks touched the puck to stop play with 1.1 seconds left in regulation. The officials reset the clock to 1.6 seconds and ordered a faceoff in the Rangers' zone. Messier and [[Craig MacTavish]] conferred and came up with a gambit to ensure the Rangers' win.&lt;ref name="StephenCole"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cole|first=Stephen|title=The Best of Hockey Night in Canada|year=2004|publisher=McArthur &amp; Company|location=Toronto|isbn=1-55278-408-8|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of them, deciding that the officials wouldn't call a penalty at such a dramatic moment, committed fouls on the final drop of the puck as first Messier, then MacTavish whacked and cross-checked Vancouver's star forward [[Pavel Bure]].&lt;ref name="StephenCole"/&gt;

'''Ergilio Pedro Hato''' (7 November 1926 – 18 December 2013), also known as Pantera Negra (Black Panther), was a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] from [[Curaçao]] in the former [[Netherlands Antilles]]. He was well known in the Caribbean and his reputation achieved beyond the boundaries of the region. He received offers to large teams including [[Ajax Amsterdam]], [[Feyenoord]] Rotterdam and [[Real Madrid Club de Fútbol]]. However, he turned down the offers because he chose not to play professionally.

==History==
His mother’s last name was Hatot, but the Civil Registry couldn’t place the name, so they decided to spell Ergilio’s last name “Hato”. Hato was always an avid soccer player. Back in the day, school yards were set up as soccer fields and monks encouraged playing before school, during breaks, and after school. Hato (19 in 1945) would have been drafted for military service had the Curaçao Soccer Federation not hosted a large international competition with teams from [[Colombia]], [[Aruba]], [[Suriname]] and the [[Netherlands]] [[Feyenoord]] in 1945. Curaçao’s “Dream Team” delivered a clean sweep. [[Feyenoord]] came in second. A huge disappointment for the Dutch, and a testament to Curaçao’s innate talent despite its small size and limited resources.

Hato became known as the best goalkeeper in Latin America and the Caribbean. He took the Netherlands Antilles team to the Olympics in 1952 (they lost against Turkey) and led Curaçao’s team to a Bronze medal at the Pan American Games in 1955. Hato’s international notoriety awarded him several lucrative offers to play professional soccer internationally, rejecting offers from teams from South America and Europe including [[Real Madrid]], [[AFC Ajax]] and [[Feyenoord]]. He pursued a career at the [[ALM Antillean Airlines]], raised a family,  and played in his local club, [[CRKSV Jong Holland]].

He lived up to his many nicknames on the field: Pantera Negra (Black Panter), Vliegende Vogel (Flying Bird) and Man van Elastiek (Elastic Man).

==Footnotes==
The Dutch publishers SWP have released a book about Mister Hato and his life. More to be found at https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134838/http://www.sportgericht.nl/489.html this publishing is to be considered the only publication in book form about Hato, in Dutch and Antilian language.

==Honours==
* The [[Ergilio Hato Stadium]] in [[Willemstad, Curaçao]] was named after him.
* The [[Curaçao International Airport|Hato International Airport]] in [[Willemstad, Curaçao]] is also named in his honor, the second passion of Ergilio was the aviation.

The''' Estadio Akron''', formerly known as the ''' Estadio Omnilife''' and '''Estadio Chivas '''(''Estadio Chivas'', {{IPA-es|esˈtaðjo ˈtʃiβas}}), is a multipurpose stadium that is used mostly for [[association football|football]] matches, including home matches for [[Club Deportivo Guadalajara]], commonly known as the "Chivas". It is part of the J.V.C. complex, and has a [[Seating capacity|capacity]] of 46,232.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.estadioomnilife.com.mx/contenidos/ventajas |title= Estadio Omnilife Ventajas |accessdate=2016-02-05|author= ''Estadio Omnilife''|date= |work= |language= Spanish|cita= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction started in February 2004, but due to financial problems and other issues, the stadium's completion was delayed for a number of years. 

The stadium hosted its first major international event with the first leg of the [[2010 Copa Libertadores Finals|2010 Finals]] of the [[Copa Libertadores]], and hosted the [[2011 Pan American Games]] [[2011 Pan American Games opening ceremony|opening]] and [[2011 Pan American Games closing ceremony|closing]] ceremonies. The stadium's artificial field caused great controversy, drawing criticism from many notable players, and in May 2012, it was announced that the stadium would replace the artificial turf with natural grass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/16/estadio-omnilife-chivas-pasto-artificial_n_1522884.html|title=Chivas decide quitar el pasto artificial del estadio Omnilife|last=Tovar|first=Sos|date=16 May 2012|website=|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|language=Spanish|trans-title=Chivas decide to remove the artificial turf from Omnilife Stadium|archivedate=8 December 2017|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Estadio Sixto Escobar''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]].  It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|soccer]] matches.

==History==
The stadium was opened on November 12, 1935.  The [[Cincinnati Reds]] conducted spring training at the stadium in 1935 and 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Majors' Spring Training Under Way Officially |author=Alan Gould |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=b8FIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fwENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1411,5278357&amp;dq=reds+puerto+rico&amp;hl=en |newspaper=The Meriden Daily Journal |date=1936-02-11 |accessdate= 2011-03-06|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 1938, the [[Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico]] voted to name the stadium and surrounding park in honor of [[Sixto Escobar]], a Puerto Rican professional boxer who became Puerto Rico's first world champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Escobar To Be Honored; Stadium in Puerto Rico Will Be Named for Champion |author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1938/04/14/archives/escobar-to-be-honoredi-stadium-in-puerto-rico-will-be-named-for.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=1938-04-14 |accessdate=2011-03-02|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A statue of Escobar stands on the grounds.

The [[Miami Marlins (IL)|Miami Marlins]] were transferred to San Juan for the 1961 season and opened the season at Sixto Escobar Stadium.  Attendance was poor and the team was moved to Charleston, WV on May 19, 1961. The [[Cangrejeros de Santurce (baseball)|Cangrejeros de Santurce]] of the professional [[Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente]] moved out to the newly constructed [[Hiram Bithorn Stadium]] in 1962.

Many events of the [[1979 Pan American Games]] were held at the stadium.

In 2000 it hosted all six matches of the inaugural [[Torneo de Copa de Puerto Rico|Copa de Puerto Rico]] soccer tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mutiny set for three games in Puerto Rico|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=20000222&amp;id=eL0MAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vV8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6734,1626919|accessdate=25 April 2017|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=February 22, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Copa featured a mix of club and national teams and was hosted by the [[Puerto Rican Football Federation]] and the [[Puerto Rico national football team|Puerto Rico MNT]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xMOgk4Acz0&lt;/ref&gt; The international competition was played over the course of a week's time, consisting of three nights of double-headers. The [[MLS]] side, [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] were the winners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/copa-puerto-rico00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the stadium was repaired and improved to accommodate the new tenant soccer team [[Club Atlético River Plate Puerto Rico|River Plate Puerto Rico]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rivercaribe.com/noticias/ago10.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827133736/http://www.rivercaribe.com/noticias/ago10.htm |archivedate=2010-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the club never played there.

The '''[[CA Excursionistas|Club Atlético Excursionistas]]''' stadium does not have an official name, and is thus simply referred to as '''Estadio de Excursionistas''' or colloquially as ''Pampa y Miñones'' or ''El Coliseo del Bajo Belgrano''.

The stadium was built in 1911 in the traditional Buenos Aires neighborhood of [[Belgrano (Buenos Aires)|Belgrano]] (more specifically what is known as "Bajo Belgrano"), and it comprises the full block between streets La Pampa, Miñones, Migueletes and José Hernández. The stadium's address is La Pampa 1376 for the press and general public, and Miñones 1780 for players and referee's.

== History ==
Excursionistas is the only club affiliated to the Argentine Football Association that has never relocated its stadium, making it a unique and historic venue.

The stadium was officially inaugurated on April 14, 1912 on the occasion of a third division match between Excursionistas and club Libertad. ''Excursio'' went on to win the match 4-0.

The stadium currently has a capacity of 7,200 spectators. In 2014 it underwent significant renovations, including a new "FIFA QUALITY PRO Artificial Turf" artificial surface (the first to be approved by the Argentine Football Association for competition), an improved lighting system, new dressing rooms and club and medical facilities.

'''Hong Kong Stadium''' is the main sports venue of [[Hong Kong]].  Redeveloped from the old '''Government Stadium''', it reopened as Hong Kong Stadium in March 1994. It has a maximum [[seating capacity]] of 40,000, including 18,260 at the main level, 3,173 at executive level, 18,510 upper level seats and 57 seats for wheelchair users.

The stadium is located in [[So Kon Po]], [[Hong Kong Island]], in valley [[Causeway Bay]]. Most international [[association football|football]] matches held in Hong Kong are held at this stadium. It is also the location for the [[Hong Kong Sevens]] [[rugby sevens]] tournament. Hong Kong Stadium also hosted the [[Rugby World Cup Sevens]] twice, in 1997 and 2005.

==History==
[[So Kon Po]] was formerly the burial ground for the 1918 fire at [[Happy Valley Racecourse]]. Then the [[Hong Kong Government]] moved all the tombs to [[Aberdeen, Hong Kong|Aberdeen]]. The old Government Stadium was a U-shaped constructed by 1953 and had a capacity of 28,000&lt;ref&gt;Takungpao, 1956-09-05, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; with partially covered seating. It witnessed the best times of Hong Kong football in the 60s and 70s. At the time, the stadium would be packed full of spectators when a top of the league clash happened and a red flag would be hoisted. Eager spectators without tickets would climb the hill behind the stadium to see the game.

The old Government Stadium was only partially covered, without sufficient seats or lighting systems. In the 90s, the [[Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club]] proposed a reconstruction plan so that Hong Kong can have a world class sports stadium.

Even before the reconstruction, the Government Stadium was Hong Kong's most important sports venue, with a clay running track around the football field. As the focus on the design was for football only, the track went to 450m, 50m longer than standard. Numerous schools held their athletic meetings here.

In 2008, 39,000&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/7694689.stm&lt;/ref&gt; people attended the first [[Bledisloe Cup]] rugby union match between Australia and New Zealand. In 2010, 26,210&lt;ref&gt;http://stats.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/records/team/highest_attendance.html?id=2267;type=series&lt;/ref&gt; people attended the second [[Bledisloe Cup]] rugby union game at the Hong Kong Stadium.

===1994 Re-construction and Wembley International===
In the early 1990s, the Government Stadium was reconstructed into a 40,000-seat rectangular stadium. No running track was built due to the restricted land size. This forced the schools to look for alternative venues.

The stadium's management contract was won by Wembley International, a foreign subsidiary of [[Wembley Stadium]], against strong competition, in March 1994.

From the first day there have been serious problems with the pitch. The owners of the stadium, the [[Urban Council]], were disappointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/football-wembley-may-lose-foreign-deal-1154406.html |title=Football: Wembley may lose foreign deal |work=The Independent |location=London |date=4 April 1998 |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It came under fire from local football officials, sports promoters and even [[Manchester United]] manager [[Alex Ferguson]], who said, before the exhibition match between Manchester United and [[South China AA]] on 20 July 1997, "The pitch is cutting up. The surface is just sand-based and the turf doesn't hold well. Injuries can occur."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/archive_news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&amp;art_id=21900&amp;sid=&amp;con_type=1&amp;archive_d_str=19970903 Major overhaul on the cards for troubled stadium]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government had hoped that the stadium could be used as a music concert venue in order to bring in more rental income. But nearby citizens complained endlessly about '[[noise pollution|noise level]]s', leading to restrictions on noise levels that effectively rendered the stadium unsuitable for concerts. This reduced greatly the income levels of the stadium and the management company, [[Wembley]], ran into financial troubles.

===1998 Hong Kong government takeover===
Wembley's management tenure at the stadium was abruptly terminated by the Provisional Urban Council (PUC) on 26 May 1998. PUC also asked Urban Services Department (USD) to assume temporary management of the Hong Kong Stadium and has also agreed to USD's proposals to returf the entire pitch of the Hong Kong Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/199805/26/0526066.htm |title=Provisional Urban Council terminates Wembley's Management Agreement for the Hong Kong Stadium |publisher=Info.gov.hk |date=26 May 1998 |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental issue between the parties was the care and maintenance of the stadium pitch, but also a complaint about an unauthorized [[bungy jump]] by Canadian [[Paul G. Boyle]].

In the end, the Hong Kong government was judged to have wrongfully terminated the management agreement and had to pay over HK$20million in damages to Wembley Plc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legalref.judiciary.gov.hk/lrs/common/search/search_result_detail_body.jsp?ID=&amp;DIS=38821&amp;QS=(choy)&amp;TP=JU |title=IN THE HIGH COURT OF THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE ACTION NO.8518 OF 1998 BETWEEN SECRETARY FOR JUSTICE Plaintiff AND WEMBLEY INTERNATIONAL (HK) LIMITED 1st Defendant WEMBLEY PLC 2nd Defendant |publisher=Legalref.judiciary.gov.hk |date= |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hong Kong Stadium is now managed by the [[Leisure and Cultural Services Department]] of Hong Kong, after the [[Urban Council]] was disbanded.

== Football ==
===Hong Kong First Division League===
[[South China AA|South China]] and [[Kitchee SC|Kitchee]] had used the sports ground as the home stadium in 2009&amp;ndash;10 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://paper.wenweipo.com/2009/07/15/SP0907150012.htm |title=2009/10賽季各球會主場 |publisher=Paper.wenweipo.com |date=15 July 2009 |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting from 2010/11 football season, only [[South China AA|South China]] use the Hong Kong Stadium as the home stadium.

=== Lunar New Year Cup ===
The ground has hosted matches of the [[Lunar New Year Cup]]

=== Full house ===
The first full house official football match (i.e. non-exhibition match) at the Hong Kong Stadium was the [[2009 AFC Cup]] semi-final second leg between [[South China AA]] and [[Kuwait SC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{zh-hk icon}} [http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/template/apple/art_main.php?iss_id=20091022&amp;sec_id=25391&amp;subsec_id=25392&amp;art_id=13338705 資料庫：正賽爆棚　紅旗再現] Apple Daily. 22 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This was added to in the same year by the [[Football at the 2009 East Asian Games|2009 East Asian Games]] football final between [[Hong Kong national under-23 football team|Hong Kong U23]] and [[Japan national under-23 football team|Japan U23]]. Although there were empty seats in the stadium, all tickets were sold or distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh-hk icon}} [http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/template/apple/art_main.php?iss_id=20091213&amp;sec_id=4104&amp;subsec_id=11866&amp;art_id=13519104 持票者甩底　大球場未滿座] Apple Daily. 13 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rugby ==
On 1 November 2008, the ground became the first stadium outside of Australia or New Zealand to host a match of the [[Bledisloe Cup]],{{cn|date=April 2017}} a rugby competition between Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand won the match, 19-14.

On 1 June 2013, the [[British and Irish Lions]] and [[Barbarian F.C.]] played a rugby union match at the Hong Kong Stadium.

== Hong Kong International Cricket Sixes ==
The ground has hosted matches of the [[Hong Kong International Cricket Sixes]] since 1996 to 1997.

==2009 East Asian Games==
The stadium was used as the final venue for both the Rugby 7s and Football tournaments of the [[2009 East Asian Games]]. Hong Kong's rugby 7s team and football team both made the final against Japan. The rugby 7s team finished second to Japan but the football team defeated them in front of over 31,000 spectators, including [[Donald Tsang]].

== 2013 muddy turf fiasco ==
In 2013, during the [[2013 Premier League Asia Trophy|Barclays Asia Trophy]], [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] manager [[Paolo Di Canio]] described the pitch as "a killer", while [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] centre-back [[Matija Nastasić]] is injured on the mudheap pitch, although Nastasić's injury was caused by a kick to the ankle according to City manager [[Manuel Pellegrini]], who refused to blame the muddy pitch. [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] manager [[André Villas-Boas]] was also critical of the pitch after [[Jan Vertonghen]], a first-choice Spurs defender, incurred an ankle injury playing on the surface. "If I can be sincere, I would prefer not to play, but this is the reality that we have to face," said the Portuguese on the eve of his side's friendly against [[South China AA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=8&amp;art_id=136027&amp;sid=40029013&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20130731&amp;fc=4 |title=League counts cost of Asian tour |date=31 July 2013 |publisher=The Standard |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523225901/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=8&amp;art_id=136027&amp;sid=40029013&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20130731&amp;fc=4 |archivedate=23 May 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/5037676/Matija-Nastasic-joins-Man-Citys-pre-season-injury-list.html|title=Pell’s Nast-y shock|author=Martin Blackburn|publisher=The Sun (United Kingdom)|date=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manchester United]] then cancelled their public training session at the stadium on Sunday amid concerns over the playing surface, did not want to further damage the playing surface or risk any injuries to their players, ahead of their exhibition match with [[Kitchee SC]] on 29 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2380002/Man-United-refuse-train-killer-Hong-Kong-stadium.html|title=United refuse to train at 'killer' Hong Kong stadium as rain continues to pour|author=Chris Wheeler|publisher=Daily Mail|date=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 July, the director of leisure and cultural services, Betty Fung Ching Suk-yee said returfing the much-criticised Hong Kong Stadium pitch is being considered, after football fans worldwide slammed the sodden, muddy surface during Barclays Asia Trophy matches on 24 and 27 July. South China FC chairman [[Steven Lo]] said in an official blog that recent matches have exposed a serious management problem. Chief Executive [[Leung Chun-ying]] said he has asked the [[Home Affairs Bureau]] and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department for short, medium and long-term remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=4&amp;art_id=136036&amp;sid=40030544&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20130731&amp;fc=4 |title=Returfing looms after pitch fiasco |date=31 July 2013 |publisher=The Standard |author=Kelly Ip |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925133738/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=4&amp;art_id=136036&amp;sid=40030544&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20130731&amp;fc=4 |archivedate=25 September 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, with support from the Jockey Club, the pitch was completely returfed. The existing turf and soil was removed, the irrigation and drainage systems replaced, and new turf laid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hong Kong Stadium turf pitch reconstruction making good progress (with photo)|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201509/23/P201509230772.htm|publisher=Hong Kong Government|date=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-sports events==
[[Jean-Michel Jarre]] held a concert at the Hong Kong Stadium in 11 March 1994. It was the first event after the re-construction of the Hong Kong Stadium.

[[Alan Tam]] held a concert at the Hong Kong Stadium from 22 April to 24 April 1994. It was the first local artist held here.

[[Image:Scout Rally 2005 in Hong Kong Stadium.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hong Kong Stadium for [[The Scout Association of Hong Kong|Scout]] Rally]]
The only time the venue is used for live events is the [[Extravaganza of China Olympic Gold Medallists]] celebration show for the [[China at the 2008 Summer Olympics|Chinese gold medallists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200808/20/P200808200266.htm |title=China's Olympic gold medallists to visit Hong Kong (with photo) |publisher=Info.gov.hk |date=20 August 2008 |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bon Jovi]] played a concert at the stadium on September 25, 1993 during [[I'll Sleep When I'm Dead Tour]]. It was their first concert in [[Hong Kong]].

Canadian Paul G. Boyle illegally bungy jumped from the roof of the Hong Kong Stadium on the morning of Friday 24 May 1996. He was not arrested but was given a lifetime ban from all Urban Council facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Delfino|first1=Brendan|title=Councillors hopping mad at bungee jumper|work=South China Morning Post|date=25 May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
At the 2013 Policy Address, Chief Executive [[Leung Chun Ying]] said once the [[Kai Tak Stadium]] is operational in 2019, the Hong Kong Stadium will be turned into a 10,000 capacity district sports arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=130212&amp;sid=38719469&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20130117 |title=Kai Tak Fantasy will become reality |author=Mary Ann Benitez and Eddie Luk |date=17 January 2013 |publisher=The Standard |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109174436/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=130212&amp;sid=38719469&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20130117 |archivedate=9 January 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
Hong Kong Stadium can accommodate 40,000. The spread is as below:
* 18,256 at Main level
* 18,507 at Upper levels
* 3,153 at Executive levels
* 57 wheelchair spaces

In addition, there are many refreshment kiosks inside the stadium.

==Other use==

The stadium was supposed to be a [[multi-purpose stadium|multi purpose]] entertainment and sports venue, due to its much greater capacity compared to the other popular and over used [[Hong Kong Coliseum]], where nearly all uses are now strictly for popular entertainment. However,  its open-air nature has led to noise complaints from residents in tower blocks surrounding the stadium. It has not been allowed to host entertainment events since 1999.

The '''International Children's Games''' ('''ICG''') is an [[International Olympic Committee]]-sanctioned event&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-14409341|title=Children's Games ceremony to take place in Lanarkshire|date=4 August 2011|work=BBC News Scotland|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 August 2011|location=Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt; held every year where children from cities around the world and between the ages of 12 and 15 participate in a variety of sports and cultural activities.

==History==
The [[Slovenia]]n sports instructor [[Metod Klemenc]] founded the International Children's Games in 1968 with the aim of promoting peace and friendship through sports to the world's youth. He organised the first International Children's Games and Cultural Festival in 1968 with the participation of teams from nine European cities.

Since that time, 37,000 children aged 12 to 15 have been in competition at 47 Summer Games and 6 Winter Games. 411 different cities, 86 countries and all 5 continents have participated. The International Children's Games and Cultural Festival has become the world's largest international multi-sport youth games, and is a recognised member of the International Olympic Committee. 

The next edition of the International Children's Games will be the Winter edition held in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[United States]] from January 6 to 11, 2019.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18399">[[File:JT-OSullivan-8-16-08-Packers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[J. T. O'Sullivan]] spent time with thirteen professional teams during his career.]]
A '''journeyman quarterback''' is a term used for an [[American football]] (typically [[National Football League|NFL]]) [[quarterback]] who plays for several teams over a career.  Such a player is typically signed to year-by-year contracts, and may be signed by a team to fill in for an injured starter.  The term [[Journeyman (sports)|journeyman]] is normally [[pejorative]].

The paradigm of a journeyman quarterback might be [[J. T. O'Sullivan]], who spent time with 11 NFL teams (plus the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] and the [[Frankfurt Galaxy]]) during his career. [[Josh Johnson (quarterback)|Josh Johnson]], who is still playing, has also spent time with 11 different NFL teams and the [[Sacramento Mountain Lions]] of the [[United Football League (2009–12)|United Football League]]. [[Chris Chandler]] started for seven different NFL franchises during his career. He also started for the [[Los Angeles Rams]] and [[St. Louis Rams]] ten years apart. [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]], who is still playing, has also started for seven different NFL franchises.

There is no accepted definition or threshold at which a person is regarded as a journeyman quarterback, and the term is descriptive rather than definitive.  [[Dave Krieg]] enjoyed a stable 11-year career with the [[Seattle Seahawks]], before leaving through [[Plan B free agency]], and then played for five different teams (usually as a starter) over the remaining seven years of his career.  But because the years of transition occurred during the later part of his career, Krieg is not generally perceived as a classic journeyman quarterback.  Similarly, [[Mark Rypien]], who played for seven years with the [[Washington Redskins]] (including a Super Bowl MVP performance in [[Super Bowl XXVI]]) before playing for seven different teams for a single season each over the remainder of his career, is not normally regarded as a journeyman for that reason.

== Stereotype ==

Many journeymen quarterbacks are seen as having mediocre talent, or having just enough talent to be the team's backup.   True journeymen quarterbacks play for several teams in a career, and may go several years between starting jobs.  However a number of journeyman quarterbacks clearly have talent, including some who started Super Bowls, received Pro Bowl selections, were drafted no. 1 overall in the NFL draft, and/or who went on to amass significant career statistics.

== Notable examples ==

There have been countless examples of journeymen quarterbacks in the NFL, but the following players are especially famous for their sporadic careers.  Despite the caricature of the journeyman quarterback, they include players who finished their careers ranked in the top 20 of many key statistical categories, and received Pro Bowl selections. They also include Super Bowl finalists and winners; for instance [[Super Bowl XXXV]] was contested between two journeyman quarterbacks ([[Trent Dilfer]] and [[Kerry Collins]]), and arguably so was [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] ([[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] and [[Rich Gannon]])&lt;ref&gt; See in particular statistical summaries below for [[Vinny Testaverde]], [[Kerry Collins]] and [[Steve DeBerg]].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- *****************************
 To mitigate the risk that this table becomes extremely long and unwieldy, I suggest we just limit it to journeyman quarterbacks who are notable for a particular reason, such as (a) high 1st round draft pick, college standout, Super Bowl appearance, or amassing significant career statistics – we can discuss further on talk page as necessary. Appreciate the list is already wider than that, but we can start to prune back if necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21170">This is a '''list of association football clubs with multiple consecutive promotions or relegations'''. 

For an [[association football]] club to achieve three consecutive [[Promotion and relegation|promotions]] is somewhat rare,{{cn|date=April 2015}} to achieve subsequent further promotions even rarer. Many football league systems are organised in a pyramid system, allowing league champions and, in many cases, clubs placed immediately behind the champions to achieve promotion, either directly or through a play-off system. To achieve three or more promotions all as league champions, like the now defunct [[Gretna F.C.|Gretna]] did from 2004 to 2007, or [[Chester F.C.|Chester]] did from 2010 to 2013 is exceptional.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

It is comparably easier for a club to achieve three consecutive relegations, as no particular effort is required.{{cn|date=April 2015}} In professional football and, to a lesser extent, in semi-professional and amateur football, this is often caused by financial trouble. 

A club that achieves promotion, followed by immediate relegation and a subsequent repeat of this cycle is often described as a [[Yo-yo club]].&lt;ref name="Up" &gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/malagal.html Up and Down!] RSSSF.com, accessed: 4 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;small&gt;The Andreasried Velodrome ([[Erfurt]], [[Germany]]) was originally built in 1885 but was entirely redeveloped in 2006-2007. This one is in fact a new track.&lt;/small&gt;

'''Major League Baseball''' ('''MLB''') is a [[professional baseball]] organization, the oldest of the four [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]]. A total of 30 teams play in the [[National League]] (NL) and [[American League]] (AL), with 15 teams in each league. The NL and AL were formed as separate legal entities in 1876 and 1901 respectively. After cooperating but remaining legally separate entities beginning in 1903, the leagues merged into a single organization led by the [[Commissioner of Baseball]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=2000nl&gt;{{cite web|title=Year In Review: 2000 National League|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/yearly/yr2000n.shtml|website=Baseball-Almanac.com|accessdate=September 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chass|first=Murray|title=BASEBALL; League Presidents Out As Baseball Centralizes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/16/sports/baseball-league-presidents-out-as-baseball-centralizes.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 16, 1999|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also oversees [[Minor League Baseball]], which comprises 256 teams affiliated with the Major League clubs. With the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]], MLB manages the international [[World Baseball Classic]] tournament.

Baseball's first openly all-professional team was founded in [[Cincinnati]] in 1869. (There had been teams in the past that paid some players, and some that had paid all players but under the table.) The first few decades of professional baseball were characterized by rivalries between leagues and by players who often jumped from one team or league to another. 
The period before 1920 in baseball was known as the [[dead-ball era]]; players rarely hit [[home run]]s during this time. Baseball survived a conspiracy to [[match fixing|fix]] the [[1919 World Series]], which came to be known as the [[Black Sox Scandal]]. The sport rose in popularity in the 1920s, and survived potential downturns during the [[Great Depression]] and World War II. Shortly after the war, [[Jackie Robinson]] broke [[baseball color line|baseball's color barrier]].

The 1950s and 1960s were a time of expansion for the AL and NL, then new stadiums and artificial turf surfaces began to change the game in the 1970s and 1980s. Home runs dominated the game during the 1990s, and media reports began to discuss the use of [[anabolic steroid]]s among Major League players in the mid-2000s. In 2006, an investigation produced the [[Mitchell Report]], which implicated many players in the use of [[performance-enhancing drugs|performance-enhancing substances]], including at least one player from each team.

Today, MLB is composed of [[Current Major League Baseball franchises|30 teams]]: 29 in the United States and 1 in Canada. Teams play 162 games each season and five teams in each league advance to a four-round [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason tournament]] that culminates in the [[World Series]], a [[best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven]] championship series between the two league champions that dates to 1903. Baseball broadcasts are aired on television, radio, and the Internet throughout North America and in several other countries throughout the world. MLB has the [[List of attendance figures at domestic professional sports leagues|highest season attendance]] of any sports league in the world with more than 73 million spectators in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Maury|title=MLB Sees Nearly 73.8 Million In Attendance For 2015, Seventh-Highest All-Time|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2015/10/06/mlb-sees-nearly-73-8-million-in-attendance-for-2015-seventh-highest-all-time/#3edf4ce7b8b9|website=Forbes.com|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational structure==
MLB is governed by the [[Major League Baseball Constitution]]. This document has undergone several incarnations since its creation in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berg|first1=Ted|title=Someone is selling MLB's original 1876 constitution, and it's expected to fetch millions|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/04/mlb-original-constitution-national-league-base-ball-sale-auction|website=USAToday.com|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the direction of the [[Commissioner of Baseball]], MLB hires and maintains the sport's [[umpire (baseball)|umpiring]] crews, and negotiates marketing, labor, and [[Major League Baseball television contracts|television contracts]]. MLB maintains a unique, controlling relationship over the sport, including most aspects of [[Minor League Baseball]]. This is due in large part to the 1922 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Federal Baseball Club v. National League]]'', which held that baseball is not [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]] and therefore not subject to federal [[antitrust]] law. This ruling has been weakened only slightly in subsequent years.&lt;ref name="Policy Debate: Should the antitrust exemption for baseball be eliminated?" /&gt; The weakened ruling granted more stability to the owners of teams and has resulted in values increasing at double-digit rates.&lt;ref name="Policy Debate: Should the antitrust exemption for baseball be eliminated?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swlearning.com/economics/policy_debates/baseball.html|title=Policy Debate: Should the antitrust exemption for baseball be eliminated?|accessdate=September 4, 2008|publisher=www.swlearning.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesportjournal.org/article/role-antitrust-laws-professional-sports-industry-financial-perspective |title=The Role of Antitrust Laws in the Professional Sports Industry From a Financial Perspective |accessdate=September 4, 2008 |work=Howard Bartee, Jr |publisher=The Sport Journal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607094652/http://www.thesportjournal.org/article/role-antitrust-laws-professional-sports-industry-financial-perspective |archivedate=June 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were several challenges to MLB's primacy in the sport between the 1870s and the [[Federal League]] in 1916; the last attempt at a new major league was the aborted [[Continental League]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="Policy Debate: Should the antitrust exemption for baseball be eliminated?" /&gt;

The chief executive of MLB is the commissioner, currently [[Rob Manfred]]. The [[chief operating officer]] is [[Tony Petitti]]. There are five other executives: president (business and media), chief communications officer, chief legal officer, chief financial officer, and chief baseball officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/8023312/major-league-baseball-executive-jimmie-lee-solomon-resigns-21-years|title=Manfred promoted; Jimmie Lee Solomon resigns|publisher=''ESPN''|date=June 7, 2012|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=execs&gt;{{cite web|title=MLB Executives|publisher=[[MLB.com]]|year=2013|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/about_mlb/executives.jsp|accessdate=February 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multimedia branch of MLB, which is based in [[Manhattan]], is [[Major League Baseball Advanced Media|MLB Advanced Media]]. This branch oversees [[MLB.com]] and each of the 30 teams' websites. Its charter states that MLB Advanced Media holds [[editorial independence]] from the league, but it is under the same ownership group and revenue-sharing plan. MLB Productions is a similarly structured wing of the league, focusing on video and traditional broadcast media. MLB also owns 67 percent of [[MLB Network]], with the other 33 percent split between several cable operators and satellite provider [[DirecTV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/network|title=MLB Network|publisher=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It operates out of studios in [[Secaucus, New Jersey]], and also has editorial independence from the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/network/about/|title=About MLB Network|publisher=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==League organization==
In 1920, the weak National Commission, which had been created to manage relationships between the two leagues, was replaced with the much more powerful Commissioner of Baseball, who had the power to make decisions for all of professional baseball unilaterally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Commissionership: A Historical Perspective|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_people.jsp?story=com|publisher=Major League Baseball Advanced Media|website=MLB.com|accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 60 years, the American and National Leagues fielded eight teams apiece.

In the 1960s, MLB expansion added eight teams, including the first non-U.S. team (the [[Montreal Expos]]). Two teams (the [[Seattle Mariners]] and the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]) were also added in the 1970s. From 1969 through 1993, each league consisted of an East and West Division. A third division, the Central Division, was added in each league in 1994. Through 1996, the two leagues met on the field only during the [[World Series]] and the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]. Regular-season [[interleague play]] was introduced in 1997.&lt;ref name=Interleague&gt;{{cite news|title=Interleague play ho-hum to some|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HjMfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=388EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2778,783864|accessdate=November 24, 2013|newspaper=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]]|date=June 4, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1995 two new franchises—the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] and [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] (now known simply as the Tampa Bay Rays)—were awarded by MLB, to begin play in 1998. This addition brought the total number of franchises to 30. In early 1997, MLB decided to assign one new team to each league: Tampa Bay joined the AL and Arizona joined the NL. The original plan was to have an odd number of teams in each league (15 per league, with 5 in each division). In order for every team to be able to play daily, this would have required interleague play to be scheduled throughout the entire season. However, it was unclear at the time if interleague play would continue after the 1998 season, as it had to be approved by the players' union. For this and other reasons, it was decided that both leagues should continue to have an even number of teams; one existing club would have to switch leagues. The [[Milwaukee Brewers#1994–98: Realignment / "We're taking this thing National"|Milwaukee Brewers]] agreed in November 1997 to move from the AL to the NL, thereby making the NL a 16-team league.&lt;ref&gt;At the same time, the [[Detroit Tigers]] agreed to move from the AL East to the AL Central (to replace Milwaukee), with the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays joining the AL East. {{cite news|url=http://www.cincypost.com/sports/1997/brew110697.html |title=Brewers switch leagues, join Reds in NL Central |work=[[The Kentucky Post]] ([[Associated Press]]) |publisher=[[E. W. Scripps Company]] |date=November 6, 1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050505095313/http://www.cincypost.com/sports/1997/brew110697.html |archivedate=May 5, 2005 |deadurl=yes  }}. ''See also'' [[Milwaukee Brewers#1994–98: Realignment / "We're taking this thing National"]].&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when the [[Houston Astros]] changed ownership prior to the 2013 season, the team moved from the NL Central to the AL West,&lt;ref name="ESPN-AstrosSale2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN-MLBTeams"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/teams|title=ESPN: MLB Baseball Teams|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in both leagues having three divisions of five teams each and allowing all teams to have a more balanced schedule.&lt;ref name="ESPN-AstrosSale2011" /&gt; Interleague play is now held throughout the season.&lt;ref name="ESPN-AstrosSale2011"&gt;MLB required the Astros to accept this move as a condition of approving their sale to [[Jim Crane]].{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|authorlink=Associated Press|title=Astros' sale finalized; 2 more for playoffs|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=November 17, 2011|url= http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/7246443/houston-astros-sale-approved-mlb|accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the AL and NL were dissolved as legal entities, and MLB became a single, overall league ''de jure'', similar to the [[National Football League]] (NFL), [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and [[National Hockey League]] (NHL)—albeit with two components called "leagues" instead of "conferences." The same [[Baseball rules|rules]] and [[regulation of sport|regulations]] are used in both leagues, with one exception: the AL operates under the [[designated hitter]] rule, while the NL does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designated Hitter Rule|url=http://m.mlb.com/glossary/rules/designated-hitter-rule|publisher=Major League Baseball Advanced Media|website=MLB.com|accessdate=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite news|last=Adamson|first=Scott|title=Nothing more irritating than playing by one set of rules in one park and a different set in another|url=http://www.independentmail.com/news/2011/jul/01/nothing-more-irritating-playing-one-set-rules-one/|newspaper=[[The Anderson Independent-Mail]]|accessdate=November 24, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203014147/http://www.independentmail.com/news/2011/jul/01/nothing-more-irritating-playing-one-set-rules-one/ |archivedate=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference in rules between leagues is unique to MLB; the other sports leagues of the U.S. and Canada have one set of rules for all teams.

==History==
{{Main|History of baseball in the United States}}

===Founding===
In the 1860s, aided by soldiers playing the game in camp during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], "New York"-style baseball expanded into a national game and spawned baseball's first governing body, [[History of baseball in the United States|The National Association of Base Ball Players]]. The NABBP existed as an amateur league for 12 years. By 1867, more than 400 clubs were members. Most of the strongest clubs remained those based in the northeastern U.S. For [[professional baseball]]'s founding year, MLB uses the year 1869—when the first professional team, the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]], was established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1869reds.com/history/ History: Legend of the Cincinnati Red Stockings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724175805/http://www.1869reds.com/history |date=July 24, 2008 }}. 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings Vintage Base Ball Team (2007). Retrieved October 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A schism developed between professional and amateur ballplayers after the founding of the Cincinnati club. The NABBP split into an amateur organization and a professional organization. The [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]], often known as the National Association (NA), was formed in 1871.&lt;ref name="base ball"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/404475/National-Association-of-Professional-Base-Ball-Players|title=National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|accessdate=September 10, 2008|publisher=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its amateur counterpart disappeared after only a few years.&lt;ref name=Rader&gt;{{cite book|last=Rader|first=Benjamin|title=Baseball: A History of America's Game|year=2008|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|isbn=0-252-07550-1|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6jplRWwEmVIC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=nabbp+baseball#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern [[Chicago Cubs]] and [[Atlanta Braves]] franchises trace their histories back to the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players in the 1870s.&lt;ref name=Spatz&gt;{{cite book|last=Spatz|first=Lyle|title=Historical Dictionary of Baseball|year=2012|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|isbn=0-8108-7954-9|page=236|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ViiCha8LoBgC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;dq=cubs+braves+napbbp#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876, the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs (later known as the [[National League]] or NL) was established after the NA proved ineffective. The league placed its emphasis on clubs rather than on players. Clubs could now enforce player contracts, preventing players from jumping to higher-paying clubs. Clubs were required to play the full schedule of games instead of forfeiting scheduled games when the club was no longer in the running for the league championship, which happened frequently under the NA. A concerted effort was made to curb gambling on games, which was leaving the validity of results in doubt. The first game in the NL—on Saturday, April 22, 1876 (at the [[Jefferson Street Grounds]], Philadelphia)—is often pointed to as the beginning of MLB.&lt;ref name=noble&gt;{{cite news|first=Marty|last=Noble|title=MLB carries on strong, 200,000 games later: Look what they started on a ballfield in Philadelphia in 1876|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110922&amp;content_id=25060814&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;partnerId=ed-5337375-55428157|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=MLB.com|date=September 23, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201192845/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110922&amp;content_id=25060814&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;partnerId=ed-5337375-55428157|archivedate=February 1, 2013|accessdate=March 29, 2018|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1876/04221876.htm Events of Saturday, April 22, 1876].

[[File:1896 Baltimore Orioles.jpg|thumb|right|National League [[Baltimore Orioles (19th century)|Baltimore Orioles]], 1896]]
The early years of the NL were tumultuous, with threats from rival leagues and a rebellion by players against the hated "reserve clause", which restricted the free movement of players between clubs. Competitor leagues formed regularly and also disbanded regularly. The most successful was the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] (1882–1891), sometimes called the "beer and whiskey league" for its tolerance of the sale of alcoholic beverages to spectators. For several years, the NL and American Association champions met in a postseason championship series—the first attempt at a [[World Series]]. The two leagues merged in 1892 as a single 12-team NL, but the NL dropped four teams after the 1899 season. This led to the formation of the [[American League]] in 1901 under AL president [[Ban Johnson]], and the resulting bidding war for players led to widespread contract-breaking and legal disputes.

The war between the AL and NL caused shock waves throughout the baseball world. At a meeting at the Leland Hotel in Chicago in 1901, the other baseball leagues negotiated a plan to maintain their independence. A new National Association was formed to oversee these minor leagues.&lt;ref name="hotel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/milb/history/|title=Minor League Baseball History|accessdate=September 10, 2008|publisher=[[MiLB.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the NA continues to this day (known as [[Minor League Baseball]]), at the time Ban Johnson saw it as a tool to end threats from smaller rivals who might expand in other territories and threaten his league's dominance.

After 1902, the NL, AL, and NA signed a new National Agreement which tied independent contracts to the reserve-clause contracts. The agreement also set up a formal classification system for minor leagues, the forerunner of today's system that was refined by [[Branch Rickey]].&lt;ref name="nabpl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roadsidephotos.sabr.org/baseball/1903NatAgree.htm|title=1903 National Agreement |accessdate=September 10, 2008|publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other early defunct baseball leagues are officially considered major leagues, and their statistics and records are included with those of the two current major leagues. These include the AA, the [[Union Association]] (1884),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/American_Association_(19th_Century)|title=American Association (19th Century)|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Players' League]] (1890),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/PL/1890.shtml|title=1890 Players' League|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Federal League]] (1914–1915).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/FL/1914.shtml|title=1914 Federal League|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/FL/1915.shtml|title=1915 Federal League|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the UA and AA are considered major leagues by many baseball researchers{{who|date=October 2015}} because of the perceived high caliber of play and the number of star players featured. Some researchers, including [[Nate Silver]], dispute the major-league status of the UA by pointing out that franchises came and went and that the St. Louis club was deliberately "stacked"; the St. Louis club was owned by the league's president and it was the only club that was close to major-league caliber.&lt;ref name="union"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/unfiltered/?p=324 |title=NerdFight: League Quality Adjustments |publisher=[[Baseball Prospectus]] |accessdate=September 8, 2008 |author=Silver, Nate |year=2007 |authorlink=Nate Silver |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212060727/http://www.baseballprospectus.com/unfiltered/?p=324 |archivedate=December 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dead-ball era===
{{Main|Dead-ball era}}
[[File:T205 Cy Young.jpg|thumb|upright|Cy Young, 1911 baseball card]]
The period between 1900 and 1919 is commonly referred to as the "Dead-Ball Era." Games of this era tended to be low scoring and were often dominated by pitchers, such as [[Walter Johnson]], [[Cy Young]], [[Christy Mathewson]], [[Mordecai Brown]], and [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]]. The term also accurately describes the condition of the baseball itself. The baseball used American rather than the modern Australian wool yarn and was not wound as tightly, affecting the distance that it would travel.&lt;ref name=McNeil&gt;{{cite book|last=McNeil|first=William|title=The Evolution of Pitching in Major League Baseball|year=2006|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-2468-0|page=60|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6ODvYhwnhn0C&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=deadball+era+yarn#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; More significantly, balls were kept in play until they were mangled, soft and sometimes lopsided. During this era, a baseball cost three dollars, equal to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|3|1919|r=2}}}} today (in [[inflation]]-adjusted [[U.S. dollars]]), and owners were reluctant to purchase new balls. Fans were expected to throw back fouls and (rare) home runs. Baseballs also became stained with tobacco juice, grass, and mud, and sometimes the juice of licorice, which some players would chew for the purpose of discoloring the ball.&lt;ref name=Keating&gt;{{cite news|last=Keating |first=Peter |title=The game that Ruth built |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/05/07/the_game_that_ruth_built/ |publisher=[[Boston.com]] |accessdate=November 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918184533/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/05/07/the_game_that_ruth_built/ |archivedate=September 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, pitchers could manipulate the ball through the use of the [[spitball]]. (In 1921 use of this pitch was restricted to a few pitchers with a [[grandfather clause]]). Additionally, many ballparks had large dimensions, such as the [[West Side Grounds]] of the Chicago Cubs, which was {{convert|560|ft}} to the center field fence, and the [[Huntington Avenue Grounds]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]], which was {{convert|635|ft}} to the center field fence, thus home runs were rare, and "small ball" tactics such as [[single (baseball)|singles]], [[Bunt (baseball)|bunts]], [[stolen base]]s, and the [[hit and run (baseball)|hit-and-run]] play dominated the strategies of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Okrent, Harris Lewine, David Nemec (2000) "The Ultimate Baseball Book", Houghton Mifflin Books, {{ISBN|0-618-05668-8}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=mAbGN_1cmhcC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%22inside+baseball%22&amp;sig=z_sYnAJ_Xovf2TTNN0l_cD_EZB0#PPA33,M1 , p. 33].&lt;/ref&gt; Hitting methods like the [[Baltimore Chop]] were used to increase the number of infield singles.&lt;ref&gt;Burt Solomon (2000) "Where They Ain't: The Fabled Life And Untimely Death Of The Original Baltimore Orioles", Simon and Schuster, {{ISBN|0-684-85917-3}} [http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/excerpts/where_they_aint.stm Excerpt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725124653/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/excerpts/where_they_aint.stm |date=July 25, 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; On a successful Baltimore chop, the batter hits the ball forcefully into the ground, causing it to bounce so high that the batter reaches first base before the ball can be fielded and thrown to the first baseman.&lt;ref name=Lieb&gt;{{cite book|last=Lieb|first=Fred|title=The Baltimore Orioles: The History of a Colorful Team in Baltimore and St. Louis|year=1955|publisher=[[SIU Press]]|isbn=0-8093-8972-X|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BahcUaZZebYC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=%22baltimore+chop%22#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adoption of the foul strike rule in the early twentieth century quickly sent baseball from a high-scoring game to one where scoring runs became a struggle. Prior to the institution of this rule, foul balls were not counted as strikes: a batter could foul off any number of pitches with no strikes counted against him; this gave an enormous advantage to the batter. In 1901, the NL adopted the foul strike rule, and the AL followed suit in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Foul_strike_rule Foul strike rule]. [[Baseball-Reference.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1919 World Series]] between the [[Chicago White Sox]] and Cincinnati Reds, baseball was rocked by allegations of a [[game fixing]] scheme known as the [[Black Sox Scandal]]. Eight players—[[Shoeless Joe Jackson|Joe Jackson]], [[Eddie Cicotte]], [[Lefty Williams|Claude "Lefty" Williams]], [[Buck Weaver|George "Buck" Weaver]], [[Chick Gandil|Arnold "Chick" Gandil]], [[Fred McMullin]], [[Swede Risberg|Charles "Swede" Risberg]], and [[Happy Felsch|Oscar "Happy" Felsch]]—intentionally lost the World Series in exchange for a ring worth $100,000 ($1,064,705.88 in 2016 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox/blk3.html |title=History Files – Chicago Black Sox: The Fix |publisher=[[Chicago History Museum]] |accessdate=October 26, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184407/http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox/blk3.html |archivedate=October 29, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being acquitted, all were permanently banned from Major League Baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox.html |title=History Files – Chicago Black Sox |publisher=[[Chicago History Museum]] |accessdate=October 26, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815042229/http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox.html |archivedate=August 15, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise in popularity===
Baseball's popularity increased in the 1920s and 1930s. The 1920 season was notable for the death of [[Ray Chapman]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]]. Chapman, who was struck in the head by a pitch and died a few hours later, became the only MLB player to die of an on-field injury, a tragedy which led directly to both leagues requiring the placing into play new, white baseballs whenever a ball became scuffed or dirty, helping bring the "dead-ball" era to an end. The following year, the [[New York Yankees]] made their first World Series appearance.&lt;ref name=Plaque&gt;{{cite web|title=Indians uncover lost Chapman plaque|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2818187|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1930s, the team had appeared in 11 World Series, winning eight of them.&lt;ref name=BR&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Yankees: Team History and Encyclopedia|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYY/|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yankees slugger [[Babe Ruth]] had set the single season home run record in 1927, hitting 60 home runs; a few years earlier, Ruth had set the same record with 29 home runs.&lt;ref name=Swat&gt;{{cite book|last=McNeil|first=William|title=The King of Swat: An Analysis of Baseball's Home Run Hitters from the Major, Minor, Negro, and Japanese Leagues|year=1997|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-0362-4|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/?id=inW5x6SDgkYC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=babe+ruth+ned+williamson#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Affected by the difficulties of the [[Great Depression]], baseball's popularity had begun a downward turn in the early 1930s. By 1932, only two MLB teams turned a profit. Attendance had fallen, due at least in part to a 10% federal amusement tax added to baseball ticket prices. Baseball owners cut their [[Major League Baseball rosters|rosters]] from 25 men to 23 men, and even the best players took pay cuts. Team executives were innovative in their attempts to survive, creating night games, broadcasting games live by radio and rolling out promotions such as free admission for women. Throughout the period of the Great Depression, no MLB teams moved or folded.&lt;ref name=Belson&gt;{{cite news|last=Belson|first=Ken|title=Apples for a Nickel, and Plenty of Empty Seats|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/sports/baseball/07depression.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=October 31, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II era===
The onset of World War II created a significant shortage of professional baseball players, as more than 500 men left MLB teams to serve in the military. Many of them played on service baseball teams that entertained military personnel in the US or in the Pacific. MLB teams of this time largely consisted of young men, older players, and those with a military classification of [[4F (military conscription)|4F]], indicating mental, physical, or moral unsuitability for service. Men like [[Pete Gray]], a one-armed outfielder, got the chance to advance to the major leagues. However, MLB rosters did not include any black players through the end of the war.&lt;ref name=War&gt;{{cite book|last=Anton|first=Todd and Bill Nowlin (eds.)|title=When Baseball Went to War|year=2008|publisher=[[Triumph Books]]|isbn=1-60078-126-8|pages=7–9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pYovAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=baseball+world+war+II#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black players, many of whom served in the war, were still restricted to playing [[Negro league baseball]].&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Alfred|title=The Negro Leagues in New Jersey: A History|year=2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-5192-0|pages=104–105|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FV0uF_RwC00C&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=negro+leagues+world+war+II#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blackout (wartime)|Wartime blackout restrictions]], designed to keep outdoor lighting at low levels, caused another problem for baseball. These rules limited traveling and night games to the point that the 1942 season nearly had to be canceled.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; On January 14, 1942, MLB Commissioner [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] wrote a letter to U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and pleaded for the continuation of baseball during the war in hopes for a start of a new major league season. President Roosevelt responded, "I honestly feel that it would be best for the country to keep baseball going. There will be fewer people unemployed and everybody will work longer hours and harder than ever before. And that means that they ought to have a chance for recreation and for taking their minds off their work even more than before."&lt;ref&gt;Roosevelt, Franklin. "Green Light Letter". January 15, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the approval of President Roosevelt, spring training began in 1942 with few repercussions. The war interrupted the careers of stars including [[Stan Musial]], [[Bob Feller]], [[Ted Williams]], and [[Joe DiMaggio]], but baseball clubs continued to field their teams.&lt;ref name=Weintraub&gt;{{cite web|last=Weintraub|first=Robert|title=Three Reichs, You're Out|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2013/04/baseball_in_world_war_ii_the_amazing_story_of_the_u_s_military_s_integrated.html|publisher=[[Slate.com]]|accessdate=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breaking the color barrier===
{{Main|Baseball color line}}
Branch Rickey, president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, began making efforts to introduce a black baseball player to the previously all-white professional baseball leagues in the mid-1940s. He selected [[Jackie Robinson]] from a list of promising Negro league players. After obtaining a commitment from Robinson to "turn the other cheek" to any racial antagonism directed at him, Rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for $600 a month. In what was later referred to as "The Noble Experiment", Robinson was the first black baseball player in the International League since the 1880s, joining the Dodgers' farm club, the [[Montreal Royals]], for the 1946 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jackierobinson.org/about/jackie.php |title=The Jackie Robinson Foundation |publisher=[[Jackie Robinson Foundation]] |accessdate=July 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628015406/http://www.jackierobinson.org/about/jackie.php |archivedate=June 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the Dodgers called up Robinson to the major leagues. On April 15, 1947, Robinson made his major league debut at Ebbets Field before a crowd of 26,623 spectators, including more than 14,000 black patrons. Black baseball fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town, abandoning the Negro league teams that they had followed exclusively. Robinson's promotion met a generally positive, although mixed, reception among newspaper writers and white major league players. Manager [[Leo Durocher]] informed his team, "I do not care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin' zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays. What's more, I say he can make us all rich. And if any of you cannot use the money, I will see that you are all traded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; |url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/35d925c7 |title=Leo Durocher |publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]] |accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a strike threat by some players, NL President [[Ford Frick]] and Baseball Commissioner [[Happy Chandler]] let it be known that any striking players would be suspended. Robinson received significant encouragement from several major league players, including Dodgers teammate [[Pee Wee Reese]] who said, "You can hate a man for many reasons. Color is not one of them."&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070412&amp;content_id=1895445&amp;vkey=perspectives&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |title=1947: A time for change |accessdate=September 12, 2009 |last=Newman |first=Mark |date=April 13, 2007 |publisher=MLB.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Robinson won the inaugural [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award]] (separate NL and AL Rookie of the Year honors were not awarded until 1949).&lt;ref name=ROY&gt;''Rookie of the Year Awards &amp; Rolaids Relief Award Winners''.

Less than three months later, [[Larry Doby]] became the first African-American to break the color barrier in the American League with the Cleveland Indians.&lt;ref name=Doby&gt;''Doby was AL's first African-American player''. [[ESPN Classic]]. June 26, 2003. Retrieved November 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, a number of other black players entered the major leagues. [[Satchel Paige]] was signed by the Indians and the Dodgers added star catcher [[Roy Campanella]] and [[Don Newcombe]], who was later the first winner of the [[Cy Young Award]] for his outstanding pitching.&lt;ref name=Finkelman&gt;{{cite book|last=Finkelman|first=Paul (ed.)|title=Encyclopedia of African American History, 1896 to the Present: From the Age of Segregation to the Twenty-First Century, Volume 1|year=2008|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-516779-1|page=145|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6gbQHxb_P0QC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=dodgers+black+players#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in baseball===
{{Main|Women in baseball}}
MLB banned the signing of women to contracts in 1952, but that ban was lifted in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/848071-are-women-the-next-demographic-to-integrate-into-major-league-baseball|title=Are Women the Next Demographic to Integrate into Major League Baseball?|date=September 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, there have been no female MLB players.

===Expanding west, south and north===
{{Main|Major League Baseball relocation of 1950s–1960s}}
[[File:Dodger Stadium.jpg|thumb|[[Dodger Stadium]] in 2007]]
From 1903 to 1953, the two major leagues consisted of two eight-team leagues. The 16 teams were located in ten cities, all in the northeastern and midwestern United States: New York City had three teams and [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[St. Louis]] each had two teams. St. Louis was the southernmost and westernmost city with a major league team. The longest possible road trip, from Boston to St. Louis, took about 24 hours by railroad. In 1953, the NL's Boston Braves became the [[Milwaukee Braves]]. In 1954, the St. Louis Browns became the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. In 1955, the [[History of the Philadelphia Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] became the [[Kansas City Athletics]].

Baseball experts consider the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers' boss [[Walter O'Malley]] to be "perhaps the most influential owner of baseball's early expansion era."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071203&amp;content_id=5714&amp;vkey=hof_pr |title=Veterans elect five into Hall of Fame: Two managers, three executives comprise Class of 2008 |accessdate=January 19, 2008 |publisher=[[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] |date=December 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204185637/http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071203&amp;content_id=5714&amp;vkey=hof_pr |archivedate=December 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[1958 Major League Baseball season]], he moved the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] to Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=FYOL /&gt; When O'Malley moved the Dodgers from Brooklyn, he appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19580428,00.html|title=Walter O'Malley|accessdate=April 28, 2008|date=April 28, 1958|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Malley was also influential in persuading the rival [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] to move west to become the San Francisco Giants.

In 1961, the first [[History of the Washington Senators|Washington Senators]] franchise moved to [[Minneapolis – Saint Paul|Minneapolis–St. Paul]] to become the [[Minnesota Twins]]. Two new teams were added to the American League at the same time: the [[Los Angeles Angels]] (who soon moved from downtown L.A. to nearby [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]]) and a new [[Washington Senators (1961–1971)|Washington Senators]] franchise. The NL added the [[Houston Astros]] and the [[New York Mets]] in 1962. The Astros (known as the "Colt .45s" during their first three seasons) became the first southern major league franchise since the [[Louisville Colonels]] folded in 1899 and the first franchise to be located along the [[Gulf Coast]]. The Mets established a reputation for futility by going 40–120 during their first season of play in the nation's media capital—and by playing only a little better in subsequent campaigns—but in their eighth season ([[1969 New York Mets season|1969]]) the Mets became the first of the 1960s expansion teams to play in the postseason, culminating in a World Series title over the heavily favored Baltimore Orioles.

In 1966, the major leagues moved to the "Deep South" when the Braves moved to Atlanta. In 1968, the Kansas City Athletics moved west to become the [[Oakland Athletics]]. In 1969, the American and National Leagues both [[1969 Major League Baseball expansion|added two expansion franchises]]. The American League added the [[Seattle Pilots]] (who became the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] after one disastrous season in Seattle) and the [[Kansas City Royals]]. The NL added the first Canadian franchise, the [[Montreal Expos]], as well as the [[San Diego Padres]].

In 1972, the second Washington Senators moved to the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex]] to become the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. In 1977, baseball [[1977 Major League Baseball expansion|expanded again]], adding a second Canadian team, the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], as well as the [[Seattle Mariners]]. Subsequently, no new teams were added until the 1990s and no teams moved until 2005. In 1993, the NL added the [[Florida Marlins]] in the [[Miami metropolitan area|Miami area]] and the [[Colorado Rockies]] in Denver. In 1998, the Brewers switched leagues by joining the National League and two new teams were added: the NL's [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] in Phoenix and the American League's [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]].

After the 2001 season, the team owners voted in favor of contraction. Several MLB teams had been considered for elimination in early talks about contraction, but the Montreal Expos and the Minnesota Twins were the two teams that came closest to folding under the plan. Plans for MLB contraction were halted when the Twins landlord was awarded a court injunction that required the team to play its 2002 home games at their stadium. MLB owners agreed to hold off on reducing the league's size until at least 2006.&lt;ref name=Plans&gt;{{cite web|title=Plans involving Angels and A's never seriously considered|url=http://a.espncdn.com/mlb/news/2003/0311/1522058.html|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Montreal Expos became the first franchise in over three decades to move when they became the [[Washington Nationals]] in 2005. This move left Canada with just one team, but it also returned baseball to the United States capital city after a 33-year absence. This franchise shift, like many previous ones, involved baseball's return to a city which had been previously abandoned. Not counting the short-lived Federal League, Montreal is the only city granted an MLB franchise since 1901 that does not currently host a team.

===Pitching dominance and rule changes===

By the late 1960s, the balance between pitching and hitting had swung in favor of the pitchers.

Following these pitching performances, in December 1968 the MLB Playing Rules Committee voted to reduce the strike zone from knees to shoulders to top of knees to armpits and lower the pitcher's mound from 15 to 10&amp;nbsp;inches, beginning in the 1969 season.&lt;ref name="mound"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1082211/index.htm |title=From Mountain To Molehill |accessdate=March 9, 2009 |author=William Leggett |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=March 24, 1969 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826001422/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1082211/index.htm |archivedate=August 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the American League, which had been suffering from much lower attendance than the National League, sought to increase scoring even further by initiating the designated hitter (DH) rule.&lt;ref name="dh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/2003/0327/1530427.html|title=Blomberg first permanent pinch-hitter|accessdate=September 8, 2008|author=Merron, Jeff|year=2003|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, as baseball expanded, [[National Football League|NFL]] football had been surging in popularity, making it economical for many of these cities to build [[multi-purpose stadium]]s instead of single-purpose baseball fields. Because of climate and economic issues, many of these facilities had playing surfaces made from [[artificial turf]], as well as the oval designs characteristic of stadiums designed to house both baseball and football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/260764-timeline-artificial-turf-in-major-league-baseball |title=Timeline: Artificial turf in Major League Baseball |work=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=September 24, 2009 |accessdate=October 13, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024070428/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/260764-timeline-artificial-turf-in-major-league-baseball |archivedate=October 24, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This often resulted in baseball fields with relatively more [[foul territory]] than older stadiums. These characteristics changed the nature of professional baseball, putting a higher premium on speed and defense over home-run hitting power, since the fields were often too big for teams to expect to hit many home runs and foul balls hit in the air could more easily be caught for outs.

Teams began to be built around pitching—particularly their bullpens—and speed on the basepaths. Artificial surfaces meant balls traveled quicker and bounced higher, so it became easier to hit [[ground ball]]s "[[in the hole]]" between the corner and middle infielders. Starting pitchers were no longer expected to throw [[complete game]]s; it was enough for a starter to pitch 6–7 innings and turn the game over to the team's [[closer (baseball)|closer]], a position which grew in importance over these decades. As stolen bases increased, home run totals dropped. After [[Willie Mays]] hit 52 home runs in 1965, only one player ([[George Foster (baseball)|George Foster]]) reached that mark until the 1990s.

===Steroid era===
{{see|Doping in baseball}}
Routinely in the late 1990s and early 2000s, baseball players hit 40 or 50 home runs in a season, a feat that was considered rare even in the 1980s. It has since become apparent that at least some of this power surge was a result of players using steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs.

==Uniforms==
{{Main|Major League Baseball uniforms|Baseball uniform}}
[[File:Baseball1870s.jpg|thumb|A baseball team and its uniforms in the 1870s. Note that the team is integrated, in contrast to 20th century MLB, which was segregated until 1947.]]
A [[baseball uniform]] is a type of uniform worn by [[position player|baseball players]], and by some non-playing personnel, such as [[Manager (baseball)|field managers]] and coaches. It is worn to indicate the person's role in the game and—through the use of logos, colors, and [[uniform number (Major League Baseball)|numbers]]—to identify the teams and their players, managers, and coaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/57907 |title=History of Baseball Uniforms |work=Americanchronicle.com |accessdate=June 13, 2011 |first=Robert |last=Riles |date=April 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816040243/http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/57907 |archivedate=August 16, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, home uniforms display the team name on the front, while away uniforms display the team's home location. In modern times, however, exceptions to this pattern have become common, with teams using their team name on both uniforms.&lt;ref name="MLB Uniforms"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportslogos.net/|title=MLB Logos|publisher=Sportslogos.net|accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most teams also have one or more [[third jersey|alternate uniforms]], usually consisting of the primary or secondary team color on the vest instead of the usual white or gray.&lt;ref name="MLB Uniforms" /&gt; In the past few decades [[throwback uniform]]s have become popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/gallery/MLB-teams-wear-throwback-uniforms-for-select-games-in-2011-051711#photo-title=Retired+attire&amp;photo=29811636|title=MLB tems wear throwback uniforms for select games in 2011|publisher=''FOX Sports''|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York Knickerbockers were the first baseball team to use uniforms, taking the field on April 4, 1849, in pants made of blue wool, white [[flannel]] shirts ([[Jersey (sport)|jerseys]]) and [[straw hat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.19cbaseball.com/sessearch.php?q=uniforms|title=Date when the New York Knickerbockers wore the first baseball uniforms and what they were made of|publisher=iterpret.co.za|accessdate=June 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interpret.co.za/art/Recreation-and-Sport/Baseball/history_of_baseball_uniforms_in_the_major_leagues.php|title=History Of Baseball Uniforms In The Major Leagues|publisher=interpret.co.za|accessdate=May 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/introduction.htm|title=The history of the baseball uniform at the National Baseball Hall of Fame|publisher=exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org|accessdate=June 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[baseball cap|Caps]] and other types of headgear have been a part of baseball uniforms from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55808234.html|title=A short history of the baseball cap.(The Home Forum) – The Christian Science Monitor&amp;nbsp;— HighBeam Research|publisher=www.highbeam.com|accessdate=May 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3660333.stm|title=Happy 50th, baseball caps|work=BBC News |accessdate=May 2, 2008| date=April 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baseball teams often wore full-brimmed straw hats or no cap at all since there was no official rule regarding headgear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070827&amp;content_id=2174187&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|title=Celebrating the rich history of baseball caps|publisher=mlb.mlb.com|accessdate=June 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the 1882 uniform rules, players on the same team wore uniforms of different colors and patterns that indicated which position they played.&lt;ref name="The history of the baseball uniform at the National Baseball Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/timeline_1882.htm|title=The history of the baseball uniform at the National Baseball Hall of Fame|publisher=exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org|accessdate=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1880s, the [[Detroit Wolverines]] and [[Washington Nationals (1886–89)|Washington Nationals]] of the [[National League]] and the [[Brooklyn Bridegrooms]] of the American Association were the first to wear striped uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/database.htm |title=National Baseball Hall of Fame&amp;nbsp;— Dressed to the Nines&amp;nbsp;— Uniform Database |publisher=exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org |accessdate=May 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411043828/http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/database.htm |archivedate=April 11, 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century, teams began the practice of having two different uniforms, one for when they played at home in their own [[Baseball park|baseball stadium]] and a different one for when they played away ([[Road game|on the road]]) at the other team's ballpark.&lt;ref name="MLB Uniforms" /&gt; It became common to wear white pants with a white color vest at home and gray pants with a gray or solid (dark) colored vest when away.&lt;ref name="MLB Uniforms" /&gt; By 1900, both home and away uniforms were standard across the major leagues.&lt;ref name=BAuni&gt;{{cite web|title=Baseball Uniforms|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/uniforms.shtml|publisher=[[Baseball Almanac]]|accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Season structure==
{{Main|Major League Baseball schedule}}

===Spring training===
{{Main|Spring training}}
[[File:Spring training.jpg|thumb|A Grapefruit League game at the former [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] camp in [[Vero Beach, Florida|Vero Beach]], Florida]]
[[Spring training]] is a series of practices and exhibition games preceding the start of the [[regular season]]. Spring training allows new players to audition for roster and position spots, and gives existing team players practice time prior to competitive play. The teams are divided into the [[Cactus League]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cactusleague.com/|title=Cactus League|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Grapefruit League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridagrapefruitleague.com/|title=Florida's Grapefruit League|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spring training has always attracted fan attention, drawing crowds who travel to the warmer climates to enjoy the weather and watch their favorite teams play, and spring training usually coincides with [[spring break]] for many college students. Autograph seekers also find greater access to players during spring training.

Spring training typically lasts almost two months, starting in mid February and running until just before the season opening day, traditionally the first week of April. As pitchers benefit from a longer training period, pitchers and catchers begin spring training several days before the rest of the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/spring-training|title=MLB: Spring Training|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regular season===
The current MLB regular season, consisting of 162 games per team, typically begins on the first Sunday in April and ends on the first Sunday in October. Each team's schedule is typically organized into three-game series, with occasional two- or four-game series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/schedule/index.jsp?tcid=mm_mlb_schedule#date=10/14/2013|title=MLB Schedule|work=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postponed games or continuations of suspended games can result in an ad hoc one-game or five-game series. A team's series are organized into homestands and road trips that group multiple series together. Teams generally play games five to seven days per week, commonly having Monday or Thursday as an off day. Frequently, games are scheduled at [[Night game#Baseball|night]]. Sunday games are generally played during the afternoon, allowing teams to travel to their next destination prior to a Monday night game. In addition, teams will play day games frequently on Opening Day, holidays, and getaway days.

Each team plays 19 games against each of its four divisional opponents. It plays one home series and one away series, amounting to six or seven games, against the 10 other teams in its league. A team also plays one of the divisions in the other league, rotating each year, with two opponents in a three-game home series, two in a three-game away series, and one with four games split between home and away. Furthermore, each team has an interleague "natural rival" (in many cases its counterpart in the same metro area) with which it plays two home games and two away games each year.

With an odd number of teams in each league (15), it is necessary to have two teams participate in interleague play for most days in the season, except when two or more teams have a day off. Each team plays 20 interleague games throughout the season, usually with just one interleague game per day, but for one weekend in late May all teams will participate in an interleague series. Use of the DH rule is determined by the [[home advantage|home team's]] league rules. Before 2013, interleague play was structured differently: there would be one weekend in mid-May and another period consisting typically of the last two-thirds of June in which all teams played interleague games (save for two NL teams each day), and no interleague games were scheduled outside those dates. (Before 2013, season-long interleague play was not necessary, because each league had an even number of teams. In 2013, the Houston Astros moved to the American League, so that each league would have 15 teams.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#League organization]] (above).&lt;/ref&gt;)

Over the course of a season, teams compete for one of the five [[Playoffs|playoff]] berths in their league. They can win one of these berths by either winning their [[MLB#League organization|division]], or by capturing a [[MLB Wild Card|wild card spot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/index.jsp?tcid=mm_mlb_standings#20130930|title=MLB: Regular Season|work=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the conclusion of the 162-game season, an additional [[One-game playoff|tie-breaking]] game (or games) may be needed to determine [[MLB postseason|postseason]] participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130904&amp;content_id=59527184&amp;c_id=mlb|title=MLB: Playoff Tiebreaker Rules|work=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===All-Star Game===
{{Main|Major League Baseball All-Star Game}}
[[File:President attends the 32nd All-Star Baseball Game, throws out first ball. Speaker of the House John W. McCormack... - NARA - 194250.jpg|right|thumb|President [[John F. Kennedy]] throwing out the first pitch at the 1962 All-Star Game at [[RFK Stadium|DC Stadium]]]]
In early-to-mid July, just after the midway point of the season, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game is held during a four-day break from the regular-season schedule. The All-Star Game features a team of players from the American League (AL)—led by the manager of the previous AL World Series team—and a team of players from the National League (NL), similarly managed, in an exhibition game. From 1959 to 1962, two games were held each season, one was held in July and one was held in August. The designated-hitter rule was used in the All-Star Game for the first time in 1989. Following games used a DH when the game was played in an AL ballpark. Since 2010, the DH rule has been in effect regardless of venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/sports/baseball/29bats.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Rosters Expanded For the All-Star Game|date=April 28, 2010|accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first official All-Star Game was held as part of the [[Century of Progress|1933 World's Fair]] in Chicago, Illinois, and was the idea of [[Arch Ward]], then sports editor for ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baseball-almanac.com/asgmenu.shtml|title=All-Star Game History|accessdate=September 7, 2008|publisher=[[Baseball Almanac]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially intended to be a one-time event, its great success resulted in making the game an annual one. Ward's contribution was recognized by Major League Baseball in 1962 with the creation of the "Arch Ward Trophy", given to the All-Star Game's Most Valuable Player each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060710&amp;content_id=1550905&amp;vkey=allstar2006&amp;fext=.jsp|last=Newman|first=Mark|title=All-Star MVP Awaits Your Vote|work=[[MLB.com]]|date=July 10, 2006|accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In 1970, it was renamed the Commissioner's Trophy, until 1985, when the name change was reversed. In 2002, it was renamed the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award]].)

Beginning in 1947, the eight position players in each team's starting lineup have been voted into the game by fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/asgmenu.shtml|title=All-Star Game|accessdate=September 6, 2008|work=baseball-almanac.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fan voting was discontinued after a 1957 ballot-box-stuffing scandal in Cincinnati: seven of the eight slots originally went to [[Cincinnati Reds|Reds]] players, two of whom were subsequently removed from the lineup to make room for Willie Mays and [[Hank Aaron]]. Fan voting was reinstated in 1970 and has continued ever since, including Internet voting in recent years.

The [[2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2002 contest in Milwaukee]] controversially ended in an 11-inning tie when both managers ran out of pitchers. In response, starting in 2003 the league which wins the All-Star game received home-field advantage in the World Series: the league champion hosted the first two games at its own ballpark as well as the last two (if necessary). The National League did not win an All-Star game and thus gain home-field advantage until 2010; it was able to overcome this disadvantage and win in three of the seven World Series from 2003 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2003_WS.shtml|title=2003 World Series (4–2): Florida Marlins (91–71) over New York Yankees (101–61)|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=September 6, 2008|work=baseball-reference.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/20036WS.shtml |title=2006 World Series (4–1): St. Louis Cardinals (83–78) over Detroit Tigers (95–67) |publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] |accessdate=September 6, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was discontinued after the 2016 season.

MLB All-Stars from both leagues have worn uniforms from their respective teams at the game with one exception. In the [[1933 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1933 All-Star Game]], the National League All-Star Team members wore special gray uniforms with "National League" written in navy blue letters across the front of the jersey.&lt;ref name="The World Series and Highlights of Baseball"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamont|first=Buchanan|title=The World Series and Highlights of Baseball|publisher=E.

When the regular season ends after the first Sunday in October (or the last Sunday in September), ten teams enter the postseason playoffs. These ten teams consist of six teams that are division champions by earning the best regular season overall [[winning percentage|win-loss record]] for their respective divisions, and four who are "wild-card" teams that are each one of two teams in their respective leagues who have earned the best regular season win-loss record, but are not division champions. Four rounds of series of games are played to determine the champion:

# [[Major League Baseball Wild Card Game|Wild Card Game]], a one-game playoff between the two wild-card teams in each league.
# [[American League Division Series]] and [[National League Division Series]], each a best-of-five-games series.
# [[American League Championship Series]] and [[National League Championship Series]], each a best-of-seven-games series played between the winning teams from the Division Series. The league champions are informally referred to as the [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]] winners.
# [[World Series]], a best-of-seven-games series played between the pennant winners of each league.

Within each league, the division winners are the #1, #2 and #3 seeds, based on win–loss records. The team with the best record among non division winners will be the first wildcard and the #4 seed. The team with the second best record among non division winners will be the second wildcard and the #5 seed. In the wildcard round, the #5 seed will play at the #4 seed in a one-game playoff. For the division series, the matchup will be the #1 seed against the Wild Card Game winner and the #2 seed against the #3 seed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1784642-mlb-playoff-format-2013-tiebreak-scenarios-wild-card-games-and-seedings|title=MLB Playoff Format 2013: Tiebreaker Scenarios, Wild Card Games and Seedings|publisher=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=September 23, 2013|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2017, home-field advantage in the World Series is determined by regular-season records of the two league champions, replacing a system used for the prior 14 seasons where the champion of the league that won the All-Star Game would receive home-field advantage.

Because each postseason series is split between the home fields of the two teams, home-field advantage does not usually play a large role in the postseason unless the series goes to its maximum number of games, giving one team an additional game at home. However, the first two games of a postseason series are hosted by the same team. That team may have an increased chance of starting the series with two wins,&lt;ref name="[[World Series]]"&gt;[[World Series]], sec. 3.2.2 (Game-by-Game), note 2; as of 2008, the 1981 Los Angeles Dodgers are the last team to win a World Series after losing the first two games on the road.&lt;/ref&gt; thereby gaining some momentum for the rest of the series.&lt;ref name="alds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pressbox.mlb.com/pressbox/news/pressbox_story.jsp?ymd=20070514&amp;content_id=1964536&amp;vkey=pressbox&amp;fext=.jsp|title=Major League Baseball announces revamped postseason schedule|accessdate=September 7, 2008|year=2007|publisher=[[MLB.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DH rule in the World Series is only used in games played at the American League Champions' home field. National League home games will play the traditional rules with each teams pitching staff batting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/batter_6.jsp|title=Official Rules: 6.00 The Batter|publisher=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, both [[Mark McGwire]] and [[Sammy Sosa]] hit more than the long-standing single-season MLB record of 61 home runs. [[Barry Bonds]] topped the record in 2001 with 73 home runs. McGwire, Bonds and Sosa became the subjects of speculation regarding the use of performance-enhancing substances. McGwire later admitted that he used a steroid hormone that was still legal in baseball during the 1998 season.&lt;ref name=ESPNsteroids&gt;{{cite web|title=The Steroids Era|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/topics/_/page/the-steroids-era|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baseball's original steroid testing policy, in effect from 2002 to 2005, provided for penalties ranging from a ten-game suspension for a first positive test to a one-year suspension for a fourth positive test. Players were tested at least once per year, with the chance that several players could be tested many times per year.&lt;ref name="wnbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnbc.com/mikedup/4077510/detail.html|title=MLB Owners, Players Reach Deal On Steroid Testing|accessdate=September 6, 2008|year=2005|publisher=wnbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 book, ''[[Game of Shadows]]'' by ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' investigative reporters [[Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada]], chronicled alleged extensive use of performance enhancers, including several types of steroids and [[growth hormone]] by baseball superstars Barry Bonds, [[Gary Sheffield]], and [[Jason Giambi]]. Former [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] George Mitchell was appointed by Selig on March 30, 2006&lt;ref name="MLB_pre"&gt;{{cite web|first=Barry|last=Bloom|title=Mitchell Report to be released today|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071212&amp;content_id=2323307&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|work=[[MLB.com]]|date=December 13, 2007|accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to investigate the use of performance-enhancing drugs in MLB. The appointment was made after several influential members of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] made negative comments about both the effectiveness and honesty of MLB's [[Major League Baseball drug policy|drug policies]] and Commissioner Selig.&lt;ref name="NYT_20071213"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Duff|last1=Wilson|first2=Michael|last2=Schmidt|title=Baseball Braces for Steroid Report From Mitchell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/13/sports/baseball/13mitchell.html?em&amp;ex=1197694800&amp;en=13aefc5012cd51c1&amp;ei=5087%0A|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 13, 2007|accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[ESPN]], some people questioned whether Mitchell's director role with the Boston Red Sox created a conflict of interest, especially because no "prime [Sox] players were in the report."&lt;ref name="report_pg_A1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.mlb.com/mitchrpt.pdf|title=Mitchell Report|format=PDF|page=A1|accessdate=December 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report named several prominent Yankees who were parts of World Series clubs; there is a long-running and fierce [[Yankees–Red Sox rivalry]].

On January 10, 2013, MLB and the players union reached an agreement to add random, in-season HGH testing. They also agreed to implement a new test to reveal the use of [[Testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] for the 2013 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baseball to Expand Drug-Testing Program|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/sports/baseball/baseball-and-union-agree-to-in-season-blood-testing-for-hgh.html?emc=na&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 10, 2013|first=Michael S.|last=Schmidt|date=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current MLB drug policy provides for an 80-game suspension for a first positive test, a 162-game suspension for a second positive test, and a lifetime suspension for a third positive test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/10690127/major-league-baseball-union-toughen-drug-agreement-provisions|title=MLB, union increase penalties for drug use|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, allegations surfaced against [[Alex Rodriguez]] and [[David Ortiz]], and [[Manny Ramirez]] received a 50-game suspension after testing positive for banned substances.

==Media coverage==

===Television===
{{Main|Major League Baseball on television}}
{{See also|List of current Major League Baseball broadcasters}}
Several networks televise baseball games, including [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox]], ESPN, and MLB Network. Since 2008, Fox Sports has broadcast MLB games on ''[[Fox Major League Baseball|Fox Saturday Baseball]]'' throughout the entire season; Fox previously only broadcast games from May to September.&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2516552|title=Fox, TBS have seven-year, $3&amp;nbsp;billion TV deal with MLB|accessdate=September 6, 2008|year=2006|publisher=[[ESPN.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox also holds rights to the All-Star Game each season. Fox also alternates League Championship Series broadcasts, broadcasting the [[American League Championship Series]] (ALCS) in odd-numbered years and the [[National League Championship Series]] (NLCS) in even-numbered years. Fox broadcasts all games of the World Series. ESPN continues to broadcast MLB games through 2013 as well, beginning with national Opening Day coverage.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=mlbespn&amp;prov=st&amp;type=lgns|title=MLB extends TV agreement with ESPN through 2013|accessdate=September 6, 2008|publisher=[[Yahoo!

ESPN also has rights to the [[Home Run Derby]] at the All-Star Game each July.&lt;ref name="espn" /&gt;

[[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] airs [[Major League Baseball on TBS|Sunday afternoon regular season games]] (non-exclusive) nationally. In 2007, TBS began its exclusive rights to any tiebreaker games that determine division or wild card champions; it also airs exclusive coverage of the [[Division Series]] round of the playoffs.&lt;ref name="tbs"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2006-07-11-hiestand-mlb_x.htm?csp=34|title=TBS drops Braves games, joins Fox in rich TV deal|accessdate=September 6, 2008|author=Michael Hiestand|work=[[USA Today]]|date=July 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; TBS carries the [[League Championship Series]] that are not included under Fox's television agreement; TBS shows the NLCS in odd-numbered years and the ALCS in even-numbered years.&lt;ref name="tv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061017&amp;content_id=1715532&amp;vkey=ps2006news&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|title=TBS signs on to air LCS games|accessdate=September 6, 2008|author=Barry M.

In January 2009, MLB launched the MLB Network, featuring news and coverage from around the league, and airing 26 live games in the 2009 season.&lt;ref name="washpost"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/17/AR2007051702492.html|author=Dave Sheinin|date=May 18, 2007|title=MLB Network Closer to Fruition|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=December 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each team also has local broadcasts for all games not carried by Fox on Saturdays or ESPN on Sunday nights. These games are typically split between a local broadcast television station and a local or [[regional sports network]] (RSN), though some teams only air local games through RSNs or through their own team networks. As Canada only contains one team, [[Sportsnet]] broadcasts Toronto Blue Jays games nationally.&lt;ref name="Sportsnet will carry all 162 games for Blue Jays" /&gt; The channel is owned by [[Rogers Communications]], who is also the parent company of the Blue Jays.&lt;ref name="Sportsnet will carry all 162 games for Blue Jays"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130322&amp;content_id=43127206&amp;notebook_id=43139768&amp;vkey=notebook_tor&amp;c_id=tor|title=Sportsnet will carry all 162 games for Blue Jays|publisher=[[MLB.com]]|date=March 22, 2013|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sportsnet also televises Fox's Saturday afternoon games, the All-Star Game, playoff games, and the World Series.&lt;ref name="Sportsnet will carry all 162 games for Blue Jays" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sportsnet&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Information|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/about/|publisher=[[Sportsnet]]|accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, [[TSN2]] began carrying ESPN ''Sunday Night Baseball'' in Canada.&lt;ref name=TSN2&gt;{{cite web|title=ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball airs on TSN 2|url=http://www.digitalhome.ca/2011/04/espn%E2%80%99s-sunday-night-baseball-airs-on-tsn-2/|publisher=Digitalhome.ca|accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blackout policy===

{{See also|Syndication exclusivity}}
[[File:MLB Blackout Areas.png|thumb|upright=1.35|MLB blackout map in the United States]]
[[File:Canadian MLB Blackout map.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|Canadian MLB blackout map]]
MLB has several [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/help/faq_blackout.jsp|title=Blackouts FAQ|publisher=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local broadcaster has priority to televise games of the team in their market over national broadcasters. For example, at one time TBS showed many Atlanta Braves games nationally and internationally in Canada. [[Fox Sports Networks]] also show many games in other areas. If the Braves played a team that FSN or another local broadcaster showed, the local station will have the broadcast rights for its own local market, while TBS would have been blacked out in the same market during the game. A market that has a local team playing in a weekday ESPN or [[ESPN2]] game and is shown on a local station will see [[ESPNews]], or, in the past, another game scheduled on ESPN or ESPN2 at the same time (if ESPN or ESPN2 operates a regional coverage broadcasting and operates a game choice), or will be subject to an alternative programming feed.&lt;ref name="Helyar"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2870960|title=Singin' the 'Baseball Blackout Blues'|last=Helyar|first=John|date=May 15, 2007|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; MLB's streaming Internet video service is also subject to the same blackout rules.

===Radio and Internet===
{{Main|Major League Baseball on the radio}}
[[ESPN Radio]] holds national broadcast rights and broadcasts ''Sunday Night Baseball'' weekly throughout the season in addition to all playoff games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2013/01/espns-star-studded-2013-sunday-night-baseball-schedule/|title=ESPN's Star-Studded 2013 Sunday Night Baseball Schedule|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|date=January 15, 2013|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights to the World Series are exclusive to ESPN.

In addition, each team employs its own announcers, who broadcast during the regular season. Most teams operate regional networks to cover their fan bases; some of these supposedly regional networks (such as the [[New York Yankees Radio Network]]) have a national reach with affiliates located across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freebaseballradio.com/NYyankeesAug.html|title=New York Yankees Radio Network|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major League Baseball has an exclusive rights deal with [[XM Satellite Radio]], which includes the channel [[MLB Network Radio]] and live play-by-play of all games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siriusxm.com/mlbnetworkradio|title=MLB Network Radio|publisher=[[Sirius XM Radio]]|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many teams also maintain a network of stations that broadcast their games in Spanish; the former [[Montreal Expos]] broadcast their games in both English and French.

MLB games are also broadcast live on the internet. All television and radio broadcasts of games are available via subscription to [[MLB.tv]] at Major League Baseball's website, MLB.com, and radio-only broadcasts are also available via subscription to MLB.com Gameday Audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/subscriptions/index.jsp?product=mlbtv&amp;affiliateId=MLBTVREDIRECT|title=MLB.tv|publisher=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio station affiliates are officially forbidden from streaming games through their Internet feeds. Blackout rules are still applied for live television broadcasts, but not radio broadcasts.

[[File:Contested mark2.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Jeff White (Australian footballer)|Jeff White]] of [[Melbourne Demons|Melbourne]] takes an overhead mark while [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]]'s [[Darren Jolly]] (#16) tries to [[One percenter (Australian rules football)#Spoil|spoil]]]]

A '''mark''' is a skill in [[Australian rules football]] where a player cleanly catches (is deemed to have controlled the ball for sufficient time or touched the ball in flight 3 or more times) a kicked ball that has travelled more than 15 metres without anyone else touching it (prior to the player marking the ball) or the ball hitting the ground.

Although catching the ball is also found in other codes of football, along with kicking the ball, it is one of the most prevalent skills in Australian football. Marking can also be one of the most spectacular and distinctive aspects of the game, and the best mark of the AFL season is awarded with the [[Mark of the Year]], with similar competitions running across smaller leagues.

The top markers in the [[Australian Football League]], like [[Jason Dunstall]] and [[Jonathan Brown (Australian footballer)|Jonathan Brown]] took an average of over 8 marks per game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players.html Player statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;  An AFL match between [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] and [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] in 2006 set a record of 303 marks in a single game.

==Rules==
Upon taking a mark, the umpire will blow the whistle to signify the mark and a player is entitled to an unimpeded kick of the ball, to advance his/her team towards their goalposts.  The nearest opposition player stands on the spot where the player marked the ball, which is also known as the mark, and becomes the man on the mark. When taking the set kick, the player must either play on or kick the ball over the mark.

The criterion for a mark is that it be caught cleanly, i.e. the player have complete control of the ball, for any length of time. As such, if the ball is caught in one grab, and then punched out from between the player's hands, a mark is paid, even if he has held it for only an instant. Similarly, if a ball is controlled, and then dislodged by another player or the ground, the mark will still be paid.

Although the rules make no provision for two players marking the ball simultaneously,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AFL|title=Laws of Australian Football|url=http://afl.com.au/portals/0/afl_docs/Laws%20of%20Football_2011.pdf|publisher=Australian Football League|accessdate=2 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327044514/http://www.afl.com.au/portals/0/afl_docs/Laws%20of%20Football_2011.pdf|archivedate=27 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; by convention the umpire will award the mark to the ''man in front'', i.e. the player who has the front position in the marking contest; if he cannot determine which player is in front, then a ball-up will result.

The mark has been included in the compromise rules used in the [[International Rules Football]] [[International Rules Series|series]] between teams from [[Australian international rules football team|Australia]] and [[Ireland international rules football team|Ireland]] since 1984.

== Origins of the mark ==
Various forms of [[football]] descended from [[English public school football games]] of the 19th century have featured a [[fair catch]] or mark. It was abolished early in the development of [[soccer]] but still exists in [[rugby union]] and [[American football]].

The mark has been one of the most distinctive features of Australian football since rules were drawn up in 1859.

Some people{{who|date=June 2018}} claim that the origin of the term ''mark'' comes from the practice of a player who has just taken a mark physically marking the ground with his/her foot, or cap which formed part of the attire worn by players in the 19th century, to show where he took the fair catch.

Others{{who|date=June 2018}} claim that the origin of the mark comes from the traditional [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] game of [[Marn Grook]], which is said to possibly have influenced Tom Wills' writing of the laws of the game. It is claimed that in Marn Grook, jumping to catch the ball, called "''mumarki''", an Aboriginal word meaning "to catch", results in a free kick.  Some{{who|date=June 2018}} counterclaim this theory as [[false etymology]].

== Types of marks ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}

[[File:Aussie rules wikipedia.jpg|A player in a marking contest attempts a one handed chest mark|right|thumb|220px]]
In Australian football, marks are often described in combination of the following ways.
* '''Overhead mark''': catching the ball with hands extended above the head&lt;ref&gt;[Overhead mark http://www.aflcommunityclub.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Coach_AFL/Drills__Skills_and_Tactics/Coaching_Tips/How_to_Play/AR10_How_to_play_Pt3_Overhead_Mark.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Contested mark''': catching the ball against one or more opponents who are attempting to also mark or spoil the player attempting the mark. This skill is declining in the professional game due to coaches discouraging preferring to avoid contests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aflcommunityclub.com.au/index.php?id=49&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=3337&amp;cHash=84fdfa4899604587d0b5040be8993b35 Contested Marking Fundamentals Anthony Rocca]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Pack mark''': catching the ball against one or more opponents and/or teammates all close to the fall of the ball.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-02/from-naitanui-to-howe-to-moorcroft3a-the-afl27s-best-high-fly/6513440&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''High mark''': catching the ball whilst jumping up in the air. [[Stewart Loewe|Stewart "Buckets" Loewe]], [[Matthew Richardson (Australian rules footballer)|Matthew Richardson]] and [[Simon Madden]] are notable exponents of the high mark.
* '''[[Spectacular mark]]''': sometimes nicknamed 'specky', 'screamer' or 'hanger', this term is most often used when a mark taken (sometimes contested) whilst jumping in the air. Additional elevation is achieved by using the legs to spring off the back or shoulders of one or more opponents and/or teammates. The movement of other players beneath the player marking can cause them to lose balance in mid air and land or fall awkwardly, enhancing the spectacle of the mark. The name reflects its popularity among spectators.
* '''Chest mark''': catching the ball and drawing it in to the chest.  This is considered the easiest mark to take, and is often used in wet weather. At professional level this skill is discouraged by coaches due to it giving opponents a much better chance of intercepting the ball from most directions.
* '''Out in front''': catching the ball with arms extended forward from the body. This skill is extremely difficult, particularly with the ball travelling low and at high speeds. At professional level this skill is preferred by coaches, as it gives opponents less chance of spoiling from behind, and if the ball spills, it will be "front and centre" of the player, which makes it much easier for rovers to predict and to execute game strategy.
* '''One-handed mark''': catching the ball with only one hand.  Rarely used in a contested situation where one player's arm is impeded by an opponent (which is typically a free kick anyway), or where the player uses upper body strength to physically fend off their opponent.  While spectacular, this skill is discouraged by coaches due to a low percentage of success and is sometimes seen as "showing off" or "lairising".
* '''Diving mark:''' leaping horizontally to catch the ball before it hits the ground.
* '''With the flight of the ball''': a mark taken running in the direction that the ball is travelling. In order to do this, the player must take their eyes off opposition players sometimes running at fast pace in the opposite direction. This type of mark is often branded "courageous", because in attempting the mark, the player must ignore the danger of a high speed collision with oncoming players. [[Wayne Carey]] and [[Jonathan Brown (Australian footballer)|Jonathan Brown]] were known for their ability to take courageous marks.
* '''Standing one's ground''': a mark taken by a player who is standing still. These are particularly difficult, because the player must wait in a stationary position, making it much easier for moving opponents to make better position.  There is also a higher risk of collision with incoming players, meaning it requires courage.
* '''Backing into a pack''': a mark taken by a player who is running or jogging backwards while facing the ball. These are particularly dangerous with an extremely high risk of collision from behind by players running at the ball at high speed.  It is also highly difficult to keep eyes on the ball whilst expecting a high collision from behind.
* '''Half volley:''' technically not a mark.  Sometimes players catch the ball so close to the ground that it is difficult to tell whether it hit or bounced off the ground.  Sometimes a player is awarded a mark by an umpires benefit of the doubt.
* '''Juggled mark''': when a player takes two or more touches of the ball to claim the mark.  The player must appear to have had control of the ball to be awarded the mark. Importantly, the mark must be completed within the field of play to be paid as a mark; it should not be paid if the first touch was inside the boundary line, but the last outside.
*[[File:Ar mark-web.jpg|220px|thumb|right|An uncontested overhead mark taken by a player in a suburban western [[Sydney AFL]] game between the [[East Coast Eagles AFC]] and [[Campbelltown Kangaroos AFC]]]]'''Fingertip mark:''' when the player is only barely able to hold the ball with his/her fingers at full stretch.  This type of mark carries a high risk of injury to fingers.
* '''Slips catch''': a fingertip mark taken low to the ground, with terminology borrowed directly from [[cricket]].

== Famous marks ==
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:LeoBarry2-1-.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Leo Barry]], middle, of the [[Sydney Swans]] takes the 2005 Grand Final winning mark in the final seconds.]] --&gt;

While the [[Mark of the Year]] competition has produced many famous marks, other marks include:

In the 1970 [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] before a record crowd, Carlton full forward, and giant of the game, [[Alex Jesaulenko]], took one of the most inspirational marks in the history of 'the Australian game' leaping high for a specky over [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]]'s Graeme Jenkin just before half time, to help inspire a [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] side that was behind by 44 points at the half.

[[Sydney Swans|Sydney]]'s [[Leo Barry]] leapt into history with his match-saving mark in the final seconds of the 2005 grand final against the [[West Coast Eagles]] to seal the game. His contested overhead mark was taken in a congested pack of 3 teammates and 3 opposition players.

[[Shaun Smith (Australian rules footballer)|Shaun Smith]]'s and [[Gary Ablett, Sr.|Gary Ablett]]'s shared title of ''Mark of the Century''.

[[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]]/[[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne]] player [[Roy Cazaly]] was renowned for his high marks, giving rise to the catchphrase and song "[[Up There Cazaly]]".

== Spoiling the mark ==
Spoiling is the technique typically employed by opposition defenders to legally stop a player from catching the ball.
Spoiling is performed by hand or fist (as a punching action) either before or shortly after the player has caught the ball in their hands.

The rules are quite strict on defensive spoiling methods.  Players are not allowed to push other players out of marking contests or make forceful front on contact with an opponent in a marking contest, if they are not simultaneously attempting to mark or spoil the ball. Also, no high contact is allowed unless such contact is incidental to attempting to mark or spoil the ball.

===Taking the arms===
Deliberately taking, hacking or chopping the arms is an infringement committed by defenders which will result in a [[Free kick (Australian rules football)|free kick]].

The ''arm interference'' free kick was introduced as a specific free kick in the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] and its affiliates in 2005, although it was paid as a blocking, striking or holding free kick previously. The free kick was designed predominately to make it easier for forwards to take contested marks by not allowing defending player to punch or pull a marking player's outstretched arms in a marking contest.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.realfooty.theage.com.au/articles/2005/04/27/1114462098452.html?from=storyrhs | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=AFL News, Scores, Stats, Transfers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule was introduced by the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] amidst on-going calls from fans and commentators to take action against the defensive tactic of [[Flooding (Australian football)|flooding]]; the rule does directly limit the effectiveness of defenders, but the AFL has never stated whether or not flooding was the reason for the change.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Marking-related injuries==
Marking can cause injuries to hands and fingers, including hyperextension, joint and tendon damage, dislocation and fractures.  Over a long period of time and with re-injury there can be long-term effects such as chronic injury and debilitating arthritis.  To overcome these injuries, some players will strap problem fingers together, whole hands, wear splints or gloves.

Some of these injuries require surgery and extended recovery, threatening professional careers.  AFL players whose careers were threatened by such injuries include [[Robert Campbell (Australian rules footballer)|Robert Campbell]], [[Fraser Gehrig]], [[Brett Backwell]] and [[Daniel Chick]].  Some players, such as Backwell and Chick, have opted for [[amputation]] of [[Digit (anatomy)|digit]]s in a bid to extend their playing careers and continue to mark the ball.

In [[gridiron football]], '''motion''' refers to the movement of an [[offense (sports)|offensive]] player at or prior to the [[snap (football)|snap]].
[[File:Green Bay Packers Offense Tight End 81 Andrew Quarless in motion Dec 2013.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Tight end]] [[Andrew Quarless]]  ''(81)'' in motion.]]

Motion occurs when a player is moving after the formation is set and ''at the time of the snap''. While there are different rules regarding motion, most mandate that no more than one player may be in motion at the time of the snap, and that only players who start in "back" positions (running backs, fullbacks, quarterbacks, flankers, H-backs, etc.) may be in motion at the snap. Additionally, the NFL (professional), NCAA (college), and NFHSAA (high school) require that they be moving laterally or backwards, and are not allowed to move towards the line of scrimmage.  The Canadian Football League and the Arena Football League allow for motion towards the line of scrimmage.

==Description==
The National Football League defines all motion and shift penalties as "illegal motion",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/rulebook/pdfs/24_Penalty_Summary.pdf|title=NFL official rule book|website=nfl.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; while both the NCAA and NFHSAA make a distinction between an "illegal shift" and "illegal motion"; an illegal shift refers to players shifting and not coming to a complete stop before the snap while illegal motion refers to a player who is in motion towards the line of scrimmage, or a player who is not a "back" in motion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/FR12.pdf NCAA official football rules]&lt;/ref&gt;  In both leagues, however, the penalty for illegal motion/illegal shift is five yards from the previous spot and replay the down.

Additionally, the offensive team may be charged with the penalty of a "false start" if a player on the offense jumps or moves abruptly, simulating the start of the play.  This movement is not normally considered a subset of the "motion" or "shift" rules, as the player is not judged to be moving into a new pre-snap position; he is merely starting the play too soon.  This is also a five-yard penalty.

==History and purpose==
In the earliest days of American football, offenses were allowed to shift and assemble themselves as much as they wanted, much as defenses do. The famous [[Notre Dame Box]] relied heavily on these shifting motions. However, rule changes were eventually implemented that prevented offenses like the Notre Dame Box from ever occurring again. The motion rules seen today resulted from these rule changes. Currently, wholesale formation shifts can only occur before the offensive formation is set, and said formation must be in place for at least one [[second]] before a snap or motion can occur.

The purposes of motion are to allow the offense to change formations, and to gain clues about the defensive playcall, particularly whether the play is "zone" or "man-to-man" coverage (typically, a defense playing "man-to-man" coverage will have a single defender follow the offensive man-in-motion across the formation, whereas in a "zone" defense, as the man-in-motion travels across the formation, which defender is assigned to cover him will change, causing the entire defensive formation to shift to accommodate the modified coverage assignments), which can often cause the offensive team to modify its own playcall, using an audible, to a play that is better suited to defeating the defense's strategy.  In leagues that allow forward motion, motion can offer a chance to gain momentum on the defenders.

==Requirements==
In all forms of football, only players in the backfield and not on the [[line of scrimmage]] may be in motion at the time of the snap. Prior to starting the motion, all players on the offensive side must be in a set [[formation (American football)|formation]] for a minimum of one [[second]].

In most versions of [[American football]], only one player may be in motion at one time, and the player must not move toward the line of scrimmage in his motion (in other words, he can only move laterally or backward). In no situation may the moving player begin on the line of scrimmage when he moves (in other words, offensive linemen are prohibited from motion prior to the snap). Any player who shifts from a lineman position to a back position must set in position at least five yards behind the line of scrimmage before going into motion.

'''Exceptions are as follows''':
* [[Pro Bowl]]: Motion is prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1037607-10-reasons-nobody-cares-about-the-nfl-pro-bowl|title=10 Reasons Nobody Cares About the NFL Pro Bowl|first=James|last=Tolj|website=bleacherreport.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[XFL]], [[World Football League|WFL]], [[Arena Football League (1987–2008)|Arena Football League]] and most other [[indoor American football|indoor football]] leagues: One player in motion is allowed; he can move toward the line of scrimmage only if he is outside the [[offensive tackle]]s.{{cn|date=May 2018}}
* [[American Indoor Football]]: Two players in motion are allowed, both can move toward the line of scrimmage outside the tackles.{{cn|date=May 2018}}
* [[Canadian football]]: All backfield players are allowed to move toward the line of scrimmage before the snap, regardless of their horizontal position.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In leagues that allow forward motion, the moving player(s) cannot cross the line of scrimmage, or else it is a false start.

'''[[Rugby union]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]]''' is a minor but growing sport.

==History==

===Soviet Period===
{{main|Rugby union in the Soviet Union}}
Rugby union was played in [[Imperial Russia|the Russian Empire]] as early as in 1908. In 1934 the Moscow Championship was started, and in 1936 the first [[Soviet Championship (rugby union)|Soviet Championship]] took place.

In 1949, rugby union was forbidden in the USSR during the "fight against the [[cosmopolitanism]]". The competitions were resumed in 1957, and the Soviet Championship in 1966. In 1975 the [[Soviet Union national rugby union team|Soviet national team]] played their first match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russianrugby.ru/history.php?Id=RUS Rugby union in Russia and USSR] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-independence===
Kyrgyz rugby, like that of [[Rugby union in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]] is mainly  confined to the military and universities, although there is a schools programme underway.&lt;ref name=Islam&gt;http://wesclark.com/rrr/islamic_rugby.html "Islam and Rugby" on the ''Rugby Readers review'' retrieved 2 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Kazakhstan has been a major impetus for rugby growth in the region ([[Almaty]] had a team in the Soviet league, and they also have a formidable women's team), and has been a major factor in keeping the game going in its neighbouring countries. For years, most of Kyrgyzstan's games, formal, or informal were against Kazakhstan, or Kazakh teams.&lt;ref name=Islam/&gt;

The Union has formed a Rugby Academy in [[Bishkek]], Kyrgyzstan, in order to improve the game, as well as forming a schools program.&lt;ref name=Islam/&gt; However, the government is reluctant to fund the sport, as it is not currently recognised by the Olympics.&lt;ref name=Islam/&gt;

Currently they take part in the Central Asian region of the [[Asian Five Nations]].

The '''Salchow''' is a [[figure skating jump]] with a takeoff from a back inside edge of one foot.  The rotation in the air is made in the direction of the curve of the take-off edge.  The landing is made on the back outside edge of the foot opposite the one used for take-off.   One or more rotations may be made in the air.&lt;ref name="skating for dummies"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yamaguchi  |first1=Kristi |authorlink1=Kristi Yamaguchi  |last2=Ness |first2=Christy |last3=Meacham |first3=Jody |title=Figure Skating for Dummies |year=1997 |publisher=Hungry Minds |location= |isbn=0-7645-5084-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was invented by the Swedish skater [[Ulrich Salchow]] in 1909.&lt;ref name="celebration"&gt;''Figure skating: a celebration'' by Beverly Smith and Dan Diamond. p 18, McClelland &amp; Stewart, {{ISBN|0771081057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
The Salchow is normally approached from a forward outside [[3 turn|3-turn]] on the left foot for a counterclockwise jump. On the left back inside edge after the 3-turn, the skater checks the rotation momentarily with the right foot extended behind and then initiates the jump by swinging the right leg forward and around with a wide, scooping motion.  The rotational momentum for the jump is gained by the swinging movement of the free leg and the coordination of the free leg and arms at the point of takeoff.

The Salchow can alternately be entered from an inside [[mohawk turn]] or from back crossovers.&lt;ref&gt;''Artistry on ice: figure skating skills and style'' by [[Nancy Kerrigan]] and Mary Spencer, p. 71, {{ISBN|0-7360-3697-0}}, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; As an edge jump, it is usually performed on a circular pattern instead of from a straight-line approach.

Occasionally, the Salchow is performed as the second or third jump in a jump combination, following a [[Axel jump|one-foot Axel]] or [[loop jump|half loop]], which land on a back inside edge.

The mechanics of a single Salchow are quite similar to those of the [[waltz jump]], the half-rotation jump from a forward outside edge. The Salchow is therefore usually the first full-rotation jump taught to beginning figure skaters.&lt;ref name="curriculum"&gt;[http://www.usfsa.org/Content/FreeSkateCurriculum.pdf USFSA Free Skate Curriculum]&lt;/ref&gt; It teaches the skater to check his or her turn and how to jump off the edge rather than the toe pick.

An alternate technique used by many skaters on the takeoff for multi-rotation (especially triple and quadruple) Salchow jumps is to allow the free foot (the right foot for a counterclockwise jumper) to rest on the ice while bringing it around to the front, instead of using the scooping motion.  Sometimes this is merely the result of a deep knee bend on the takeoff leg.  While Salchows performed with this technique have been ratified by the [[International Skating Union]] in recent years, some skating purists object to it because in some cases it is clear that the skater is gaining material assist into the jump from pushing off the supposed "free foot", instead of merely skimming it over the ice. For example, Sonia Bianchetti, former chair of the ISU Technical Committee, has referred to the two-footed Salchow entry as "a severe error for which a steep deduction had to be applied by the judges".&lt;ref&gt;Sonia Bianchetti Garbato:  ''Cracked Ice''.  {{ISBN|88-86753-72-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-footed Salchow entry is also confusing to spectators because the resulting jump can more strongly resemble a [[loop jump]] or [[toe loop jump]] than a traditional Salchow.

==Variants==

A variant of the Salchow that is rarely performed today is the ''one-foot Salchow'', which lands on the same back inside edge used for the jump takeoff, much like a [[loop jump|half loop]] or [[Axel jump|one-foot Axel]]. The one-foot Salchow can be used in a jump combination followed by a regular Salchow jump.  For example, in the 1970s, Canadian skater [[Toller Cranston]] sometimes performed a jump combination consisting of a one-foot Axel, one-foot double Salchow, and regular double Salchow.

==History==
[[Image:1908 Olympic Games Ulrich Salchow.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Salchow on the ice in 1908]]
[[Ulrich Salchow]] invented the jump that bears his name in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ulrich-Salchow|title=Ulrich Salchow {{!}} Swedish athlete|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Theresa Weld]] was the first female skater to perform it, at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]]; she was reprimanded for attempting anything so "unladylike",&lt;ref name=culture/&gt; but that did not stop other female skaters from performing jumps.

Double Salchows were first performed by [[Gillis Grafström]] for men in the 1920s, and [[Cecilia Colledge]] for women in the late 1930s.&lt;ref name=culture&gt;''Culture on ice: figure skating &amp; cultural meaning'' by Ellyn Kestnbaum, pp. 92–93, 2003, Wesleyan University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8195-6642-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first triple Salchow was landed by [[Ronnie Robertson]] at the 1955 [[World Figure Skating Championships]].

[[Petra Burka]] has been credited as being the first woman to land a triple Salchow jump (and also the first triple jump of any type by a woman), in domestic competition at the 1962 Canadian Championships and in international competition at the 1965 World Championships.&lt;ref name="celebration"/&gt;  However, according to a contemporary report on the [[1961 European Figure Skating Championships]], both [[Helli Sengstschmid]] and [[Jana Mrazkova]] did triple Salchows at that event,&lt;ref&gt;"The European Championships", ''Skating'' magazine, May 1961&lt;/ref&gt; predating Burka's earliest claim.

[[Timothy Goebel]] is recognized to have landed the first [[Quad (figure skating)|quadruple]] Salchow at the [[1998 Junior Series Final]].  Goebel's jump, however, used the aforementioned controversial two-footed Salchow technique.  The first female skater to have landed a quadruple Salchow in competition was [[Miki Ando]] at the 2002 [[Junior Grand Prix Final]]. Until 2018, no other female skater successfully landed the jump until [[Alexandra Trusova]] landed it at the [[2018 World Junior Figure Skating Championships]], at just age 13.

The first throw quadruple Salchow pair element in international competition&lt;ref name=isu/&gt; was performed on November 17, 2007, by [[Tiffany Vise]] and [[Derek Trent]] of the United States at the [[2007 Trophée Eric Bompard]] competition.&lt;ref name=isu&gt;[http://www.isu.org/vsite/vcontent/content/transnews/0,10869,4844-128610-19728-18886-280290-3572-4771-layout160-129918-news-item,00.html ISU : Full Story&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://isu.sportcentric.net/db//files/serve.php?id&amp;#61;750 |title= International Skating Union Media Advisory |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140107021152/http://isu.sportcentric.net/db//files/serve.php?id&amp;#61;750 |archivedate= 2014-01-07 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 15, 2018, during the individual pairs free skate at the 2018 Olympics, [[Meagan Duhamel]] and [[Eric Radford]] became the first pair to complete a quadruple throw Salchow jump at any Winter Olympic competition.&lt;ref name=NBC180215/&gt;&lt;ref name=HP180215/&gt;&lt;ref name=OWG2018ORB/&gt;

==Usage note==
Ulrich Salchow's surname was pronounced {{IPA-sv|ˈsalkɔv|}} (anglicized to {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|l|k|ɒ|v}}), but the name of the jump in English is invariably pronounced as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|l|k|aʊ}} in North America and {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|l|k|oʊ}} in Europe.

Skaters sometimes abbreviate the name of the Salchow to either ''sal''&lt;ref&gt;''Competitive Figure Skating: A Parent's Guide'' by Robert S. Ogilvie, p. 261, 1985, Harper Collins, {{ISBN|978-0-06-015375-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''sow''.

The '''Sport Science College ("SSC")''' of [[Beijing Sport University]] (BSU) was founded in 1958. Through nearly 50 years of development, the SSC has had seven departments: Department of Sport Physiology, Department of Sport Anatomy, Department of Sport Medicine, Department of Sport Biochemistry, Department of Sport Biomechanics, Department of Sport Psychology, Department of Sport Statistics and Physique Measurement, and The Experimentation Center and Rehabilitation Center which pertains to the SSC. In 2002, the National Ministry of Education approved the SSC’s sport science program as the national key discipline, which means the preeminence in the national high education system. It is the only sport science college which has such an honor in [[China]].

==Programmes==
The SSC is the cradle of [[sport science|sport scientists]] of China. It is the first university that is authorized by the National Ministry of Education to confer a doctoral degree of sport science in China. There are three [[bachelor's degree]] programs (Sport Science, Sport Rehabilitation and Health, Sport Psychology), three [[master's degree]] programs (Sport Science, Sport Rehabilitation and Health, Sport Psychology) and one [[doctorate|doctoral program]] (Sport Science).

The Sport Science program ranks No.1 in the counterpart universities of China. The SSC is one of very few universities in China that provides all the programs of BS, MA. and Ph.D. in sport science. 1102 bachelors, 350 masters and 55 doctors have graduated from SSC since it was founded. There are 400 undergraduate students and 150 graduate students now in SSC. They all play important roles in the cutting edge of sport science research and they are the elites of sport science research of China.

==Research==
The SSC stands on the cutting edge of sport science research. The SSC has a complete setting of subjects, excellent faculty and the strong foundational support of the nation. The research interests of the faculty involve all respects of sport science and health promotion. The SSC faculty and students are charged with many research projects of national [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] teams. It is pre-eminent in investigating the relationship between performance and incretion, elite athletes selection, hypoxic training, monitoring and assessment of athlete performance, nutrition supplementation, biomechanical analysis of movement, sport injury prevention and rehabilitation, psychological training and recovery, exercise treatment and prevention of chronic diseases. The SSC is the major undertaker of National Physical Fitness Monitor (NPFM). During the last several decades, it has focusing on the supervision and research of national physical fitness and making great contribution to the establishment of National Physical Fitness Monitor.

==2008 Olympics==
As the [[2008 Beijing Olympic Games]] draw near, the SSC of BSU will make an even greater contribution to the development of sport of China.

'''''Such Is Life: The Troubled Times of Ben Cousins''''' is a 2010 Australian [[documentary film]] about [[Australian rules football]] player [[Ben Cousins]]. Directed by [[Paul Goldman]] and filmed over a two-year period, the documentary charts Cousins' rise to fame as a star player for the [[West Coast Eagles]] and explores how his decorated career became marred by controversies, most notably a series of highly publicised drug-related scandals that resulted in him being sacked by his club and banned from playing in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) for one year.

Cousins helped produce the documentary, stating that he hoped it would serve as a cautionary tale against drug use. It features him talking candidly about his drug addiction, taking various illicit substances, and associating with [[organised crime|underworld]] figures. Among those interviewed for the documentary were family members, friends, and football and media personalities.

Within days of Cousins' 2010 retirement from the AFL, the documentary premiered on [[Seven Network|Channel Seven]] and was screened in two parts over successive nights, the first on 25 August. It was a ratings hit and went on to become "one of the most-watched documentaries in Australian history."&lt;ref name=toohey/&gt; Critics and audiences were polarised by the film with some calling it a harrowing portrait of Cousins' fall from grace, while others criticised it for glamourising his life of crime and excess.

''Such is Life'' begins with an introductory statement by Cousins, saying he hoped the documentary would serve as a powerful warning against drug use.&lt;ref name=toohey/&gt; Through interviews with Cousins and others, it juxtaposes his on-field success as a [[West Coast Eagles]] footballer with his developing drug habit, one that he traces to his teenage years.&lt;ref name=ash&gt;Adshead, Gary (21 August 2010). [https://thewest.com.au/news/australia/drugs-football-girls-such-was-life-for-young-ben-ng-ya-201397 "Drugs, football, girls: such was life for young Ben"], ''The West''. Retrieved 8 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; He details how during his career he would go on "benders" and "annihilate and launch into as much as drugs as [he] could", and is shown taking illicit substances, such as snorting [[cocaine]] and smoking a crack pipe.&lt;ref name=lib&gt;Walker, Ben (8 July 2018).

Retrieved 7 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; While he goes on to condemn such behaviour, he claims that for much of his career, the more drugs he took the better he played.&lt;ref name=ped/&gt;

The documentary covers several major controversies, such as Cousins' association with [[organised crime|underworld]] figures involved in shootings and stabbings in [[Perth]]'s nightclub scene, and how he was the last person to see West Coast teammate and close friend [[Chris Mainwaring]] alive before he died from a cocaine overdose.&lt;ref name=ash/&gt; Losing the [[2005 AFL Grand Final]] is cited as the beginning of Cousins' "fall from grace", evidenced by his swimming the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]] to escape a [[sobriety checkpoint|booze bus]].&lt;ref name=ash/&gt; The periods leading up to and after his 2007 sacking from West Coast and one-year AFL ban are interspersed with stints in rehab, brushes with the law, and instances of drug-induced psychosis. The documentary also reveals that Cousins shaved his body and head in 2008 because he was "paranoid" about failing a [[hair test]] as part of a bid to return to the AFL.&lt;ref&gt;Spitts, Scott (27 August 2018).

Retrieved 8 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Cousins closed out his career playing for [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]], and while the AFL is depicted as wanting to portray him as "cured", he openly admits to being a permanently recovering drug addict.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, Jesse (27 August 2010).

==Production==
[[File:Anthony Mundine (19982427788).jpg|thumb|upright|Boxer [[Anthony Mundine]] encouraged Cousins to make the film.]]
Soon after Cousins' ban from the AFL, boxer [[Anthony Mundine]] and his manager, [[Khoder Nasser]], suggested to him that he make a film about his life. "He had to do it," Mundine later said. "I didn't know it was going to be so full-on but it has to be that way. You can't make it Hollywood. It's got to be real."&lt;ref name=toohey/&gt; Mundine and Nasser introduced Cousins to film producer Paul Butler and editor Scott Walton of [[Brisbane]]'s 50/50 Films, who "embedded" with the footballer over 2008, "when he was in no-man's land".&lt;ref name=toohey/&gt; At times when they could not be there to film Cousins, they left him with a camera to shoot his own activities.&lt;ref name=toohey/&gt; The duo had already shot approximately 100 hours of footage when the project was handed to [[Paul Goldman]], known for directing music videos and his controversial 2002 film ''[[Australian Rules (film)|Australian Rules]]''. Goldman shot another 100 or so hours, and the 200 hours of footage was then cut down to over 90 minutes.&lt;ref name=swift&gt;{{cite journal | last = Swift | first = Brendan  | date = October 2010 | title = Documentary: Behind the Headlines | journal = Inside Film | volume = 23 | issue = 136 | ISSN = 1447-2252 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cousins funded the production in its early stages and is credited as an [[executive producer]].&lt;ref name=jim/&gt; Melbourne entrepreneur and businessman [[Michael Gudinski]] helped produce and promote the film.&lt;ref name=gud/&gt;

The title ''Such is Life'' is inspired by Cousins' tattoo of Australian [[bushranger]] and outlaw [[Ned Kelly]]'s alleged last words before his execution in 1880.&lt;ref name=ped&gt;[https://www.pedestrian.tv/entertainment/to-fallen-heroes-ben-cousins-such-is-life/ "To Fallen Heroes: Ben Cousins’ “Such Is Life”"], ''Pedestrian TV''.

Critics were divided on whether the documentary successfully cautioned viewers against drug use. Simon White of ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'' wrote that ''Such is Life'' would deliver a powerful message to young people: "It is a harrowing story of how a young man with the world at his feet lost his way". He went on to praise it as "a must-see program".&lt;ref&gt;White, Simon (20 August 2010).

Anybody who sees this film and thinks it glorifies drug use would have to be on drugs."&lt;ref name=jim/&gt; Conversely, Melinda Houston opined in the same newspaper that "the facts of Ben Cousin's life make it hard to see how any lesson can be drawn from his experiences except that even if you do develop a massive drug problem, as long as you're handsome enough and rich enough and talented enough, you'll emerge from it still looking like a Greek god and with a thriving career."&lt;ref&gt;Houston, Melinda (19 August 2010).

Retrieved 7 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Age]]'', a common criticism from commentators and talkback radio callers was that the first part did not "present a stronger case to young people against taking such drugs as amphetamines, ice and ecstasy."&lt;ref name=brodie/&gt; Journalist Paul Toohey called the [[cautionary tale]] angle an "afterthought" of Cousins. Rather, Toohey writes, the documentary "would be about making money; giving [Cousins] something to do and punishing the media by telling his story on his own terms. He would also punish the AFL, for choosing him to take the drug fall."&lt;ref name=toohey&gt;Toohey, Paul (18 September 2010).

The Australian Drug Foundation criticised the film for showing Cousins taking drugs, saying, "the research evidence indicates that to portray drug use is to normalise drug use for some people, and that may glamorise that drug use, show people how to do it, and that can by itself encourage other people."&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Martin (12 August 2010).

Amid speculation that ''Such is Life'' could lead to Cousins being charged with drug offences, a spokesperson for the [[Western Australia Police]] said that there was not enough proof: "If he wants to come out and tell us 'I took drugs' then we can do something, ...

A '''water hog''' is a machine that removes water from [[sports ground]]s. The water hog was invented by [[Hugh McLaughlin (publisher)|Hugh McLaughlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/migration/hugh-mclaughlin-125435.html |title= Joseph O'Malley |work= [[Irish Independent]] |date= 8 January 2006 |accessdate =10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Driven by a rider, it has a wide, front roller that absorbs the water, transfers it to a storage tank, and allows it to be discharged in a safe location. Some water hogs can suck off excess water at a rate of 200 gallons per minute and throw it as far as 100 feet away from the machine. It is designed so that it will not damage the turf.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune golf"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/24660409.html?dids=24660409:24660409&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+20%2C+1987&amp;author=Reid+Hanley&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=BUTLER+CALLS+IN+THE+WATER+HOGS&amp;pqatl=google |title= Butler Calls In The Water Hogs |author= Reid Hanley |work= [[Chicago Tribune]] |date= 20 August 1987 |accessdate =10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally devised for use on [[cricket pitch]]es,&lt;ref name="County Ground, Taunton"/&gt; it is now used at a wide range of sporting venues including [[golf]] [[putting green]]s,&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune golf"/&gt; [[Association football|football grounds]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.altrinchamfc.co.uk/alt0405zzi.htm |title= Cover-Up |publisher= [[Altrincham F.C.]] |date= 24 June 2005 |accessdate =10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; American football stadiums,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WT&amp;p_theme=wt&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB0F11FB9362852&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title= Here comes the sun, but only briefly |publisher= [[Washington Times]] |date= 15 January 1995 |accessdate =11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[gaelic football]] stadiums where it has proved very successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/croker-stands-up-to-mother-nature-1456250.html |title= Croker stands up to Mother Nature |author= Ronan Flanagan |work= [[Irish Independent]] |date= 5 August 2008 |accessdate =10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sport of [[cricket]], the '''wicket''' is one of the two sets of three [[Stump (cricket)|stumps]] and two [[Bail (cricket)|bails]] at either end of the [[Cricket pitch|pitch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-8-the-wickets/ |title=Law 8 – The wickets |publisher=MCC |accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The wicket is guarded by a [[Batsman (cricket)|batsman]] who, with his [[cricket bat|bat]], attempts to prevent the [[Cricket ball|ball]] from hitting the wicket. The origin of the word is from [[wicket gate]], a small gate. Historically, cricket wickets had only two stumps and one bail and looked like a gate.  The third (middle) stump was introduced in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/articles/z683qp3 |title=The origins of cricket jargon |work=BBC Bitesize |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through [[metonymic]] usage, the dismissal of a batsman is the ''taking of a wicket'',&lt;ref name=cric&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/239756.html "A glossary of cricket terms". ESPNcricinfo. Retrieved 13 May 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[cricket pitch]] is sometimes called ''the wicket''.

==''Laws of Cricket''==
[[Image:Cricket Stumps en.svg|right|thumb|260px|Each wicket consists of three [[stump (cricket)|stumps]], upright wooden poles that are hammered into the ground, topped with two wooden crosspieces, known as the [[bail (cricket)|bails]].]]

The size and shape of the wicket has changed several times during the last 300 years and its dimensions and placing is now determined by Law 8 in the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'', thus:

* '''Law 8: The wickets'''.  The wicket consists of three wooden stumps that are {{convert|28|in|cm|2}} tall. The stumps are placed along the batting crease with equal distances between each stump. They are positioned so they are {{convert|9|in|cm|2}} wide. Two wooden bails are placed in shallow grooves on top of the stumps. The bails must not project more than {{convert|0.5|in|cm|2}} above the stumps, and must, for men's cricket, be {{convert|4.31 |in|cm|2}} long.

There are also specified lengths for the barrel and spigots of the bail. There are different specifications for the wickets and bails for junior cricket. The umpires may dispense with the bails if conditions are unfit (e.g., if it is windy they might fall off by themselves). Further details on the specifications of the wickets are contained in Appendix D to the laws.

==Dismissing a batsman==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[James Graham (cricketer)]] --&gt;
{{Main article|Dismissal (cricket)}}
'''Losing a wicket''' refers to a [[Batsman (cricket)|batsman]] getting out. If dismissed by a [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]], the bowler is said to have ''taken his wicket''. The number of wickets taken is the primary measure of a bowler's ability.

For a batsman to be dismissed by being [[bowled]], [[run out]], [[stumped]] or [[hit wicket]], his wicket needs to be put down. What this means is defined by Law 29. A wicket is put down if a [[Bail (cricket)|bail]] is completely removed from the top of the stumps, or a stump is struck out of the grounds by the ball, the striker's bat, the striker's person (or by any part of his clothing or equipment becoming detached from his person), a [[Fielding (cricket)|fielder]] (with his hand or arm, and provided that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the hand of the arm so used). A 2010 amendment to the Laws clarified the rare circumstance where a bat breaks during the course of a shot and the detached debris breaks the wicket; the wicket has been put down in this circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lords.org/latest-news/news-archive/mcc-announces-eight-law-changes,1735,NS.html)|title=MCC announce eight Law changes|date=30 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221092414/http://www.lords.org/latest-news/news-archive/mcc-announces-eight-law-changes,1735,NS.html)|archivedate=21 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wicket is also put down if a fielder pulls a stump out of the ground in the same manner.
[[File:Sutcliffe - bail stays put.jpg|thumb|200px|A ball from [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] hits the stumps but does not dislodge the [[Bail (cricket)|bail]], [[English cricket team in Australia in 1932–33|Sydney, 1932]]. The wicket was not put down, and so the batsman ([[Herbert Sutcliffe]]) was [[not out]].]]
If one bail is off, removing the remaining bail or striking or pulling any of the three stumps out of the ground is sufficient to put the wicket down. A fielder may remake the wicket, if necessary, in order to put it down to have an opportunity of running out a batsman.

If however both bails are off, a fielder must remove one of the three stumps out of the ground with the ball, or pull it out of the ground with a hand or arm, provided that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the hand of the arm so used.

If the [[Umpire (cricket)|umpires]] have agreed to dispense with bails, because, for example, it is too windy for the bails to remain on the stumps, the decision as to whether the wicket has been put down is one for the umpire concerned to decide. After a decision to play without bails, the wicket has been put down if the umpire concerned is satisfied that the wicket has been struck by the ball, by the striker's [[Bat (cricket)|bat]], person, or items of his clothing or equipment separated from his person as described above, or by a fielder with the hand holding the ball or with the arm of the hand holding the ball.

==Partnership==
The sequence of time over which two particular batsmen bat together, a ''[[partnership (cricket)|partnership]]'', is referred to as a specifically numbered '''wicket''' when discriminating it from other partnerships in the [[innings]].
*The '''first wicket''' partnership is from the start of the innings until one of the first two batsmen gets out.
* The '''second wicket''' partnership is from when the third batsman gets in until a second batsman gets out.
* etc...
* The '''tenth wicket''' or '''last wicket''' partnership is from when the eleventh (last) batsman gets in until a tenth (last) batsman gets out.

==Winning by number of wickets==
A team can win a match by a certain number of wickets. This means that they were batting last, and reached the winning target with a certain number of batsmen still not dismissed. A team's innings ends when ten batsmen are dismissed, so, for example, if the side scored the required number of runs to win with only three batsmen dismissed, they are said to have won by seven wickets.

==The pitch==
The word ''wicket'' is also sometimes used to refer to the cricket [[Cricket pitch|pitch]] itself. According to the ''Laws of Cricket'', this usage is incorrect, but it is in common usage and commonly understood by cricket followers. This usage probably derives from the days when the outfield was kept short by grazing sheep on it and the playing surface, which was specially prepared, was protected from them by a light wicker fence around it. Since many regular grounds had resident bat-makers it is quite possible that the branches cut off from the willow wood used for the bats formed all or part of this fence.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The term ''[[sticky wicket]]'' refers to a situation in which the pitch has become damp, typically due to rain or high humidity. This makes the path of the ball more unpredictable thus making the job of defending the stumps that much more difficult. The full phrase is thought to have originally been "to bat on a sticky wicket." Such pitches were commonplace at all levels of the game (i.e. up to Test Match level) until the late 1950s.

==In other sports==
The arches used in [[croquet]] and [[roque]] are sometimes referred to as ''wickets'', especially in [[American English]].  These arches descend from the ancestral game of [[ground billiards]] (which may also be related to cricket), and were formerly called the ''hoop'', ''arch'' or ''port''.  The port remained a prominent feature of indoor table [[Cue sport|billiards]] until well into the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Clare"&gt;{{Cite book
