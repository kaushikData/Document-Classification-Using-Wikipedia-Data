'''Bekwel''' (Bekwil) is a [[Bantu language]] of the [[Republic of the Congo]]. There are some 10,000 speakers there, with a quarter that number across the border in Gabon, and perhaps a similar on the opposite side in Cameroon. It is rather close to [[Nzime language|Nzime]] (Koonzime).

Maho (2009) considers Nkonabeeb (Konabembe) to be a dialect of Bekwil rather than of [[Mpumpong language|Mpumpong]].

In the aftermath of the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], Belarus declared independence as the [[Belarusian People's Republic]], which was conquered by Soviet Russia. The [[Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia]] became a founding [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent republic of the Soviet Union]] in 1922 and was renamed as the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Byelorussian SSR). Belarus lost almost half of its territory to Poland after the [[Polish–Soviet War]] of 1919–1921. Much of the borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939, when some lands of the [[Second Polish Republic]] were reintegrated into it after the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], and were finalized after World War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref name="uni1"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o85YDMTeMrUC&amp;dq=reunification+of+western+belarus| title=National purpose in the world economy: post-Soviet states in comparative perspective| last=Abdelal| first=Rawi| year=2001| publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]| isbn=978-0-8014-3879-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uni2"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGA4o-UhAfgC&amp;pg=PA713&amp;dq=reunification+of+western+belarus#v=onepage| title=Europa World Year, Book 1| last=Taylor &amp; Francis Group| year=2004| publisher=[[Routledge|Europa publications]] |isbn= 978-1-85743-254-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uni3"/&gt; During WWII, military operations devastated Belarus, which lost about a third of its population and more than half of its economic resources.&lt;ref name="axell"&gt;{{cite book| last=Axell| first=Albert| title=Russia's Heroes, 1941–45| publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers| year=2002| page=247| isbn=0-7867-1011-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years.

In 2000, Belarus and Russia signed a treaty for greater cooperation, forming the [[Union State]]. Over 70% of Belarus's population of 9.49&amp;nbsp;million resides in urban areas. More than 80% of the population is ethnic [[Belarusians|Belarusian]], with sizable minorities of [[Russians]], [[Poles]] and [[Ukrainians]]. Since a referendum in 1995, the country has had two official languages: [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. The [[Constitution of Belarus]] does not declare any official religion, although the primary religion in the country is [[Belarusian Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]]. The second-most widespread religion, [[Catholic Church in Belarus|Roman Catholicism]], has a much smaller following; nevertheless, Belarus celebrates both Orthodox and Catholic versions of Christmas and Easter as [[Public holidays in Belarus|national holidays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://president.gov.by/special/en/holidays_en/| title=The official Internet portal of the President of the Republic of Belarus.

Belarus has shown no aspirations for joining the [[European Union]] but nevertheless maintains a [[Belarus–European Union relations|bilateral relationship with the organisation]], and likewise participates in two EU projects: the [[Eastern Partnership]] and the [[Baku Initiative]].

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
The name ''Belarus'' is closely related with the term ''Belaya Rus{{'}}'', i.e., ''[[White Rus']]''. There are several claims to the origin of the name ''White Rus'.''&lt;ref name="Zaprudnik 1993 2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zaprudnik|1993|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ethno-religious theory suggests that the name used to describe the part of old [[Ruthenia]]n lands within the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] that had been populated mostly by early Christianized [[Slavs]], as opposed to [[Black Ruthenia]], which was predominantly inhabited by pagan [[Balts]].&lt;ref&gt;Аб паходжанні назваў Белая і Чорная Русь (Eng. "About the Origins of the Names of White and Black Ruthenia"), Язэп Юхо (Joseph Juho), 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternate explanation for the name comments on the white clothing worn by the local Slavic population.&lt;ref name="Zaprudnik 1993 2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Minahan|1998|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third theory suggests that the old Rus' lands that were not conquered by the [[Tatars]] (i.e., Polotsk, Vitebsk and Mogilev) had been referred to as "White Rus'".&lt;ref name="Zaprudnik 1993 2"/&gt;

The name ''Rus'' is often conflated with its Latin forms ''Russia'' and ''Ruthenia'', thus Belarus is often referred to as ''White Russia'' or ''White Ruthenia''. The name first appeared in [[Medieval German literature|German]] and [[Medieval Latin literature|Latin]] [[medieval literature]]; the chronicles of [[Jan of Czarnków]] mention the imprisonment of Lithuanian grand duke [[Jogaila]] and his mother at "{{lang|la|Albae Russiae, Poloczk dicto}}" in 1381.&lt;ref name="vauchez"&gt;{{Harvnb|Vauchez|Dobson|Lapidge|2001|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some languages, including German, Afrikaans and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the country is generally called "White Russia" to this day (''{{lang|de|Weißrussland}}'' and ''{{lang|nl|Wit-Rusland}}'' respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Laenderinformationen/00-SiHi/BelarusSicherheit.html |title=Belarus: Reise- und Sicherheitshinweise |work=Auswärtiges Amt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/reisadviezen/inhoud/belarus-wit-rusland|title=Reisadvies Belarus (Wit-Rusland) |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin term "Alba Russia" was used again by [[Pope Pius VI]] in 1783 to recognize the [[Society of Jesus]] there, exclaiming "{{lang|la|Approbo Societatem Jesu in Alba Russia degentem, approbo, approbo}}."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Courson|1879|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known use of ''White Russia'' to refer to Belarus was in the late-16th century by Englishman Sir [[Jerome Horsey]], who was known for his close contacts with the Russian Royal Court.&lt;ref name="alies"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bely |first=Alies |title=The chronicle of the White Russia: an essay on the history of one geographical name |publisher=Encyclopedix |year=2000 |location=Minsk, Belarus |isbn=985-6599-12-1 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 17th century, the Russian [[tsar]]s used "White Rus" to describe the lands added from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Plokhy|2001|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stemp Efrasinia Polackaja.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Stamp with the [[Cross of Saint Euphrosyne|Cross of St. Euphrosyne]] from 1992]]

The term ''Belorussia'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Белору́ссия}}, the latter part similar but spelled and stressed differently from Росси́я, ''Russia'') first rose in the days of the [[Russian Empire]], and the Russian Tsar was usually styled "the Tsar of All the Russias", as ''Russia'' or the ''Russian Empire'' was formed by three parts of Russia—the [[Great Russia|Great]], [[Little Russia|Little]], and [[White Ruthenia|White]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XAItI5C_JPUC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=Belorussia+Russian+Empire |title=Where Nation-States Come From: Institutional Change in the Age of Nationalism |author=Philip G. Roeder |date=15 December 2011 |isbn=978-0-691-13467-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This asserted that the territories are all Russian and all the peoples are also Russian; in the case of the Belarusians, they were variants of the Russian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=oUydX_3rG0AC&amp;pg=PA385&amp;lpg=PA385&amp;dq=Belorussia+name |title=Handbook of Language and Ethnic Identity: The Success-Failure Continuum in Language and Ethnic Identity Efforts |date=13 April 2011 |isbn=978-0-19-983799-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in 1917, the term "White Russia" caused some confusion, as it was also the name of the military force that opposed the red Bolsheviks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richmond|1995|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of the Byelorussian SSR, the term ''Byelorussia'' was embraced as part of a national consciousness. In western Belarus under Polish control, ''Byelorussia'' became commonly used in the regions of [[Białystok]] and [[Grodno]] during the interwar period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ioffe |first=Grigory |title=Understanding Belarus and How Western Foreign Policy Misses the Mark |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc |date=25 February 2008 |page=41 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=00B6wxgftH8C&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=west+belarus |isbn=0-7425-5558-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Byelorussia'' (its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form) was only used officially until 1991, when the [[Supreme Soviet of Belarus|Supreme Soviet]] of the Byelorussian SSR decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called ''Republic of Belarus'' ({{lang|ru|Республика Беларусь}} spelled in Russian), as well its abridged form should be "Belarus". The law decreed that all the forms of the new term should be transliterated into other languages from their [[Belarusian language]] forms. The use of Byelorussian SSR and any abbreviations thereof were allowed from 1991 to 1993.&lt;ref name="bynamelaw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pravo.kulichki.com/zak/year1991/doc47159.htm |title=Law of the Republic of Belarus—About the name of the Republic of Belarus |accessdate=6 October 2007 |date=19 September 1991 |publisher=Pravo—Law of the Republic of Belarus |language=Russian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative forces in the newly independent Belarus did not support the name change and opposed its inclusion in the 1991 draft of the [[Constitution of Belarus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryder|1998|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, the name ''Byelorussia'' was replaced by ''Belarus'' in English.&lt;ref name="Zaprudnik 1993 4-5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zaprudnik|1993|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the adjective ''Belorussian'' or ''Byelorussian'' was replaced by ''Belarusian'' in English. ''Belarusian'' is closer to the original Belarusian term of ''{{lang|be-Latn|bielaruski}}''.&lt;ref name="Zaprudnik 1993 4-5"/&gt; Belarusian intelligentsia in the [[Stalin era]] attempted to change the name from ''Byelorussia'' to a form of ''Krivia'' because of the supposed connection with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Treadgold|Ellison|1999|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some nationalists object to the name for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://euroradio.fm/en/swedish-government-urged-change-belarus-official-name |title=Swedish government urged to change Belarus' official name |accessdate=2 February 2010|date=13 July 2009 |work=European Radio for Belarus }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="levy"&gt;{{Harvnb|Levy|Spilling|2009|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several local newspapers kept the old name of the country in Russian in their names, for example ''{{lang|ru-Latn|[[Komsomolskaya Pravda|Komsomolskaya Pravda v Byelorussii]]}}'', which is the localized publication of a popular Russian newspaper. Also, those who wish for Belarus to be reunited with Russia continue to use ''Belorussia''.&lt;ref name="levy"/&gt; Officially, the full name of the country is "Republic of Belarus" ({{lang|be|Рэспубліка Беларусь}}, {{lang|ru|Республика Беларусь}}, {{lang|be-Latn|Respublika Belarus}} {{Audio|Be-Republic of Belarus.oga|listen}}).&lt;ref name="bynamelaw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bo.html |title=Belarus&amp;nbsp;– Government |accessdate=22 December 2007 |date=13 December 2007 |work=[[The World Factbook]] |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211220928/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bo.html |archivedate=11 December 2007 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Belarus}}

===Early history===
From 5000 to 2000 BC, [[Bandkeramik]] cultures predominated. In addition, remains from the [[Dnieper-Donets culture]] were found in Belarus and parts of [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Ian|last2=Jameson|first2=Robert|title=A Dictionary of Archaeology|publisher=Wiley|year=2008|pages=203–04|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8HKDtlPuM2oC&amp;pg=PA203|isbn=978-0-470-75196-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cimmerians]] and other pastoralists roamed through the area by 1,000 BC, and by 500 AD, Slavs had taken up residence, which was circumscribed by the [[Scythians]] who roamed its outskirts. Invaders from Asia, among whom were the [[Huns]] and [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], swept through c. 400–600 AD, but were unable to dislodge the Slavic presence.&lt;ref&gt;John Haywood, ''Historical Atlas, Ancient and Classical World'' (1998).&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The region that is now Belarus was first settled by [[Baltic peoples|Baltic]] tribes in the 3rd century. Around the 5th century, the area was taken over by Slavic tribes. The takeover was partially due to the lack of military coordination of the Balts but the gradual assimilation of the Balts into Slavic culture was peaceful in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zaprudnik|1993|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alex K Polotsk general.png|thumb|upright=1|[[Principality of Polotsk]]]]

===Principality of Polotsk===
{{Further|Kievan Rus'|Principality of Polotsk|Grand Duchy of Lithuania}}
In the 9th century some principalities arose on the territory of modern Belarus. Among them was the Principality of Polotsk that for most of the time was effectively an independent State (apart from about 20 years when it was a Vassal of Kievan Rus'). The Principality of Polotsk was the first nation state to be established on the land of Belarus.

===Grand Duchy of Lithuania===
Many early Rus' principalities were virtually razed or severely affected by a major [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasion]] in the 13th century, but the lands of modern Belarus avoided the brunt of the invasion and were eventually joined the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Charles Henry|title=The Conversion of Europe|publisher=Longmans, Green|year=1917|pages=491–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no sources of military seizure, but the annals affirm the alliance and united foreign policy of Polotsk and Lithuania for decades. For example, the Chronicle of Novgorod informs about "Izyaslav had been set to be Knyaz in Luki and covered Novgorod from the Lithuanians" in 1198 when Luki is situated on the east from Polotsk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michell|first1=Robert|last2=Shakhmaton|first2=A.A|last3=Forbes|first3=Nevill|last4=Beazley|first4=C.

The Grand Duchy of Lithuania, whose territory started its existence between Nemunas and Neris rivers and existed in the center of Europe in the 13th–18th centuries and comprised entire territories of contemporary Belarus, Ukraine, partially Poland, Lithuania and Latvia and stretched from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea.

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===
{{Further|Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth}}
On 2 February 1386, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]] were joined in a [[personal union]] through a [[Union of Krewo|marriage of their rulers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Jones|editor-first=Michael|last=Rowell|first=S.C.|contribution=Baltic Europe|title=The New Cambridge Medieval History (Vol. 6)|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|page=710|isbn=0-521-36290-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This union set in motion the developments that eventually resulted in the formation of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], created in 1569 by the [[Union of Lublin]].

The Lithuanian nobles was forced to go for rapprochement because of the threat coming from [[Muscovy]].
To strengthen the independence in the format of the union, three editions of the [[Statutes of Lithuania]] were issued in the 16th century. 
The third Article of the Statute establishes that all lands of Grand Duchy of Lithuania will be eternally in Grand Duchy of Lithuania and never enter as a part of other states. It allowed to own the land within Grand Duchy of Lithuania only to own families. Anyone from outside Duchy would be honored with property only own it after swearing to Grand Duke of Lithuania. These articles were aimed to defend the rights of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania nobility against Polish, Prussian and other aristocracy of [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

In the years following the union, the process of gradual [[Polonization]] of both Lithuanians and Ruthenians gained steady momentum. In culture and social life, both the Polish language and Catholicism became dominant, and in 1696, [[Polish language|Polish]] replaced Ruthenian as the official language—with the Ruthenian language being banned from administrative use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=103&amp;menu=00 "Belarusian": UCLA Language Materials Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222171418/http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=103&amp;menu=00# |date=22 December 2015 }}, ucla.edu; accessed 4 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Ruthenian peasants, continued to speak their own language and remained faithful to the [[Belarusian Greek Catholic Church]]. Statutes were initially only issued in [[Ruthenian language]] and later also in Polish. Around 1840 the Statutes were banned by the Russian tsar following the [[November Uprising]]. Modern Ukrainian lands used it until 1860s.

In a [[Russification]] drive in the 1840s, [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] prohibited use of the Belarusian language in public schools, campaigned against Belarusian publications and tried to pressure those who had converted to Catholicism under the Poles to reconvert to the Orthodox faith.

The Belarusian People's Republic was a first attempt to create an independent Belarusian state under name "Belarus". Despite the many efforts state ceased to exist cause territory was occupied and controlled by [[German Imperial Army]], [[Imperial Russian Army]] and than [[Red Army]] in [[World War I]] times. It existed only from 1918 to 1919 but created prerequisites for the formation of the state idea around the newly name "Belarus" on these lands. The choice of the name was probably based the fact that the intelligent core of young government was educated in the tsardom universities with a corresponding education around the ideology of West-Russianism.&lt;ref name="Jr.Zaprudnik2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vitali Silitski, Jr.|author2=Jan Zaprudnik|title=The A to Z of Belarus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bQXyAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA308|date=7 April 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-1-4617-3174-0|pages=308–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Republic of Central Lithuania]] was a short-lived political entity, which was the last attempt to restore Lithuania in the historical confederacy state (it was also supposed to create Lithuania Upper and Lithuania Lower). The republic was created in 1920 following [[Żeligowski's Mutiny|the staged rebellion]] of soldiers of the [[1st Lithuanian–Belarusian Division]] of the [[Polish Army]] under [[Lucjan Żeligowski]]. Centered on the historical capital of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], [[Vilna]] ({{lang-lt|Vilnius}}, {{lang-pl|Wilno}}), for 18 months the entity served as a [[buffer state]] between [[Poland]], upon which it depended, and Lithuania, which claimed the area.&lt;ref name="von Rauch"&gt;{{cite book | first=Georg von |last=Rauch |authorlink=Georg von Rauch | editor=Gerald Onn | title =The Baltic States: Years of Independence – Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, 1917–40 | year =1974 | pages = 100–102 | chapter =The Early Stages of Independence | chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=emBIdi4LPz8C&amp;pg=PA101 |publisher =C.

The Soviets invaded and annexed much of eastern Poland, which had been part of the country since the [[Peace of Riga]] two decades earlier.

[[File:House of Representatives of Belarus.jpg|thumb|[[House of Representatives of Belarus]]]]

Belarus is a [[presidential system|presidential]] republic, governed by a [[President of Belarus|president]] and the [[National Assembly of Belarus|National Assembly]]. The [[term of office|term]] for each presidency is five years. Under the 1994 constitution, the president could serve for only two terms as president, but a [[Belarusian referendum, 2004|change in the constitution in 2004]] eliminated term limits.&lt;ref name="bbclukapro"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3882843.stm|title=Profile: Alexander Lukashenko|accessdate=30 April 2010|date=9 January 2007|work=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420191928/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3882843.stm| archivedate=20 April 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Lukashenko]] has been the president of Belarus since 1994. In 1996, Lukashenko called for a controversial vote to extend the presidential term from five to seven years, and as a result [[Belarusian presidential election, 2001|the election]] that was supposed to occur in 1999 was pushed back to 2001. The [[Belarusian referendum, 1996|referendum on the extension]] was denounced as a "fantastic" fake by the chief electoral officer, [[Viktar Hanchar]], who was removed from the office for official matters only during the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffries, Ian|year=2004|title=The countries of the former Soviet Union at the turn of the twenty-first century: the Baltic and European states in transition|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-25230-X|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Assembly is a [[bicameralism|bicameral parliament]] comprising the 110-member [[House of Representatives of Belarus|House of Representatives]] (the lower house) and the 64-member [[Council of the Republic of Belarus|Council of the Republic]] (the upper house).&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of Belarus]] Chapter 4, Art. 90 and 91&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Victory square, Minsk 01.jpg|thumb|[[Victory Square, Minsk|Victory Square]] in [[Minsk]]]]
The House of Representatives has the power to appoint the [[List of Belarusian Prime Ministers|prime minister]], make constitutional amendments, call for a [[Motion of Confidence|vote of confidence]] on the prime minister, and make suggestions on foreign and domestic policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belarus 1994 (rev. 2004)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Belarus_2004?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of the Republic has the power to select various government officials, conduct an impeachment trial of the president, and accept or reject the bills passed by the House of Representatives. Each chamber has the ability to veto any law passed by local officials if it is contrary to the constitution.&lt;ref name="conby"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.president.gov.by/en/press19332.html#doc|title=Section&amp;nbsp;IV:The President, Parliament, Government, the Courts|accessdate=22 December 2007|year=2004|work=[[Constitution of Belarus]]|publisher=Press Service of the President of the Republic of Belarus|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217035445/http://www.president.gov.by/en/press19332.html|archivedate=17 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government includes a Council of Ministers, headed by the prime minister and five deputy prime ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.government.by/en/eng_sostav1.html |title=Deputy Prime Ministers of the Republic of Belarus |accessdate=21 April 2010|year=2010|publisher=Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304020325/http://www.government.by/en/eng_sostav1.html|archivedate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of this council need not be members of the legislature and are appointed by the president. The judiciary comprises the [[Supreme Court of Belarus|Supreme Court]] and specialized courts such as the [[Constitutional Court of Belarus|Constitutional Court]], which deals with specific issues related to constitutional and business law. The judges of national courts are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Council of the Republic. For criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the Supreme Court.

In the [[Belarusian parliamentary election, 2012|2012 parliamentary election]], 105 of the 110 members elected to the House of Representatives were not affiliated with any political party.

===Election controversies===
Neither the pro-Lukashenko parties, such as the [[Belarusian Socialist Sporting Party]] and the [[Republican Party of Labour and Justice]], nor the [[People's Coalition 5 Plus]] opposition parties, such as the [[Partyja BPF|Belarusian People's Front]] and the [[United Civil Party of Belarus]], won any seats in the [[Elections in Belarus#Elections of 2004|2004 elections]]. Groups such as the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) declared the election "un-free" because of the opposition parties' poor results and media bias in favor of the government.&lt;ref name="OSCE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/belarus/38658|format=PDF|title=OSCE Report on the October 2004 parliamentary elections|date=December 2004|publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|accessdate=21 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Belarusian presidential election, 2006|2006 presidential election]], Lukashenko was opposed by [[Alaksandar Milinkievič]], who represented a coalition of opposition parties, and by [[Alaksandar Kazulin]] of the Social Democrats. Kazulin was detained and beaten by police during protests surrounding the [[All Belarusian People's Assembly]]. Lukashenko won the election with 80% of the vote; the Russian Federation and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] deemed the vote open and fair&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc06/EDOC10890.pdf|title=Belarus in the aftermath of the Presidential election of 19 March 2006|accessdate=25 May 2010|date=11 April 2006|format=PDF|publisher=Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111084334/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FWorkingDocs%2FDoc06%2FEDOC10890.pdf|archivedate=11 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the OSCE and other organizations called the election unfair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4766024.stm|date=2 March 2006|title=Belarus rally marred by arrests|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=26 March 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313155728/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4766024.stm|archivedate=13 March 2006|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the December completion of the [[Belarusian presidential election, 2010|2010 presidential election]], Lukashenko was elected to a fourth straight term with nearly 80% of the vote in elections. The runner-up opposition leader [[Andrei Sannikov]] received less than 3% of the vote; independent observers criticized the election as fraudulent. When opposition protesters took to the streets in [[Minsk]], many people, including most rival presidential candidates, were beaten and arrested by the state militia.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belarus/8224956/Police-guard-threatened-to-rape-Belarus-Free-Theatre-director-after-election-protest.html|title=Police guard threatened to rape Belarus Free Theatre director after election protest|last=Oliphant|first=Roland|date=25 December 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=22 April 2011|location=London, UK|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311053243/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belarus/8224956/Police-guard-threatened-to-rape-Belarus-Free-Theatre-director-after-election-protest.html|archivedate=11 March 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the candidates, including Sannikov, were sentenced to prison or house arrest for terms which are mainly and typically over four years.&lt;ref name="SannikovSentenced"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13400666 Belarus opposition leader Andrei Sannikov jailed], [[BBC News Online]] (14 May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kyi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/russia/detail/93334|title=Belarus: 7 presidential candidates face 15 years|publisher=[[Kyiv Post]]|date=22 December 2010|accessdate=23 December 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119193447/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/russia/detail/93334|archivedate=19 January 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six months later amid an unprecedented economic crisis, activists utilized social networking to initiate a fresh round of protests characterized by wordless hand-clapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2081858,00.htm|author=Motlagh, Jason|title=Why Belarus' Dictator Is Not Fond of Applause|work=Time|accessdate=8 July 2011|date=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption===
The judicial system in Belarus lacks independence and is subject to political interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Human Rights Reports: Belarus|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2012/eur/204263.htm|work=The US Department of State|publisher=The US Department of State|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corrupt practices such as bribery often took place during tender processes, and [[whistleblower]] protection and national [[ombudsman]] are lacking in Belarus's anti-corruption system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snapshot of the Belarus Country Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/belarus/snapshot.aspx|work=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|publisher=GAN Integrity Solutions}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a political will to fight against corruption in the government, and the government has made some progress in combating corruption, such as minimizing tax regulations in order to improve transparency in the tax office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doing Business 2014– Belarus|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/|work=The World Bank &amp; IFC|publisher=The World Bank &amp; IFC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lukashenko announced a new law in 2014 that will prohibit [[kolkhoz]] workers (around 9% of total work force) from leaving their jobs at will—a change of job and living location will require permission from governors.

The Byelorussian SSR was one of the two Soviet republics that joined the [[United Nations]] along with the Ukrainian SSR as one of the original 51 members in 1945. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, under international law, Belarus became the internationally recognized successor state to the Byelorussian SSR, retaining its UN membership.

Belarus and Russia have been close trading partners and diplomatic allies since the breakup of the Soviet Union.

Until 1 July 2016, the currency of Belarus was the [[Belarusian ruble]] (BYR). The currency was introduced in May 1992, replacing the [[Soviet ruble]].

After Belarus was incorporated into the Soviet Union, the Soviet government took control of the Republic's cultural affairs. At first, a policy of "Belarusianization" was followed in the newly formed Byelorussian SSR. This policy was reversed in the 1930s, and the majority of prominent Belarusian intellectuals and nationalist advocates were either exiled or killed in Stalinist purges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tereshkovich|first=Pavel|author2=Robert J.

[[Music of Belarus|Music in Belarus]] largely comprises a rich tradition of folk and religious music. The country's folk music traditions can be traced back to the times of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. In the 19th century, Polish composer [[Stanisław Moniuszko]] composed operas and chamber music pieces while living in Minsk. During his stay, he worked with Belarusian poet [[Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich]] and created the opera ''Sialanka'' (''Peasant Woman''). At the end of the 19th century, major Belarusian cities formed their own opera and ballet companies. The ballet ''[[Nightingale (ballet)|Nightingale]]'' by M. Kroshner was composed during the Soviet era and became the first Belarusian ballet showcased at the National Academic Vialiki Ballet Theatre in Minsk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Crystal|last=Zou|title=Ballets for Christmas|date=11 December 2003|url=http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2003/1211/wh28-1.html|work=Shanghai Star|accessdate=20 December 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225084753/http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2003/1211/wh28-1.html|archivedate=25 February 2005|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], music focused on the hardships of the Belarusian people or on those who took up arms in defense of the homeland.

===Dress===
The traditional Belarusian dress originates from the [[Kievan Rus']] period. Due to the cool climate, clothes were designed to preserve body heat and were usually made from [[flax]] or [[wool]]. They were decorated with ornate patterns influenced by the neighboring cultures: Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Russians, and other European nations. Each region of Belarus has developed specific design patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belarusguide.com/culture1/clothing/index.html|title=Belarusian traditional clothing|publisher=Belarusguide.com|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One ornamental pattern common in early dresses currently decorates the hoist of the [[Flag of Belarus|Belarusian national flag]], adopted in a [[Belarusian referendum, 1995|disputed referendum]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fotw.fivestarflags.com/by.html#orn|title=Belarus – Ornament, Flags of the World|publisher=Fotw.fivestarflags.com|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
[[File:Potato pancakes.jpg|thumb|right|[[Potato pancake|Draniki]], the national dish]]
[[Belarusian cuisine]] consists mainly of vegetables, meat (particularly pork), and bread. Foods are usually either slowly cooked or [[stewed]]. Typically, Belarusians eat a light breakfast and two hearty meals, with dinner being the largest meal of the day. [[Wheat]] and [[rye]] breads are consumed in Belarus, but rye is more plentiful because conditions are too harsh for growing wheat. To show hospitality, a host traditionally presents an offering of [[bread and salt]] when greeting a guest or visitor.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Citizenship and Immigration&amp;nbsp;– [http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/belarus/eating.html Cultures Profile Project&amp;nbsp;– Eating the Belarusian Way] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320041709/http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/belarus/eating.html |date=20 March 2007 }} (1998); retrieved 21 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CIOPORA''' is the '''International Community of Breeders of Asexually Reproduced Ornamental and Fruit Varieties''' ([[French language|French]] – Communauté Internationale des Obtenteurs de Plantes Ornamentales et Frutières à Reproduction Asexuée, [[German language|German]] - Internationale Gemeinschaft der Züchter vegetativ vermehrbarer Zier- und Obstpflanzen, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] - Comunidad Internacional de Fitomejoradores de Plantas ornamentales y frutales de reproducción asexuada).

CIOPORA groups together individual [[plant breeding|breeders]] of [[ornamental plant|ornamental]] and [[fruit]] plants, breeding companies, as well as [[Intellectual Property|IP]] attorneys and consultants. Established in 1961 under [[Swiss law]], CIOPORA is an independent [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] and non-governmental international [[Voluntary association|association]], whose main objective is to monitor and to facilitate the constant development of the systems of protection of [[Intellectual Property]] (IP) Rights for plant innovation in the [[Horticulture|horticultural]] and fruit sector.&lt;ref&gt;LLewelyn, M., [https://books.google.com/books?id=pff4I9gVk2cC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "European Bio-Protection Laws: Rebels with a Cause"], ''in Rimmer, M. Patent Law and Biological Inventions. 2006:13''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Establishment ==

The founding meeting of CIOPORA took place on February 4, 1961 in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] with [[Wilhelm Kordes]] II elected as its first President. Preceding the Diplomatic Conference of November 1961 in Paris, where CIOPORA participated&lt;ref&gt;Dutfield, G., [https://books.google.com/books?id=0RimPDA43fAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PT54#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Turning Plant Variety into Intellectual Property: The UPOV Convention in Tansey 2012"], ''in Tansey, G. The Future Control of Food. 2012''&lt;/ref&gt; along with the representatives of 12 European nations, which resulted in the adoption of the [[Plant breeders' rights|International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants]] and the establishment of the [[UPOV]], CIOPORA published its first position paper providing its comments on the provisions of the Draft Convention. This paper was distributed among the various delegations attending the Paris Conference in November 1961. Since 1961 CIOPORA has been representing the interests of breeders of [[asexual reproduction|asexually reproduced]] [[plant variety (law)|plant varieties]] before the policy-making authorities, such as [[UPOV]], [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]], [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], as well as single [[government]]s.

== Mission ==

CIOPORA is set out to influence and participate in the development of systems of [[Intellectual Property]] Protection for breeders of ornamental and fruit plant varieties worldwide. Representing the interests of breeders in the horticultural sector, CIOPORA monitors the national and international laws targeted at the regulation of Plant Variety Protection, such as [[Plant breeders' rights|Plant Breeders' Rights]], [[Patent]]s and [[Plant breeders' rights|Plant Patents]]. CIOPORA pursues the enhancement, unification and synchronization of the relevant national and international [[legislation]] as well as the consideration of the breeders’ positions and interests by the law-making authorities. For instance, CIOPORA works closely with [[CPVO]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpvo.europa.eu/main/en/home/news/press-releases-and-communications/224-visit-of-ciopora-delegation "CIOPORA delegation visits CPVO"]&lt;/ref&gt; the Community Plant Variety Office, by participating in its Administrative Council as an observer. The Secretary General of CIOPORA Dr. Edgar Krieger is a member of the CPVO Working Group of Legal Experts. The meetings of the Group take place three to four times a year in [[Paris]], [[France]]. CIOPORA also an active participant and, from time to time, a co-organizer of the educational events held by CPVO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpvo.europa.eu/main/en/home/news/press-releases-and-communications/229-press-release-seminar-on-enforcement-in-rome "CPVO Seminar on the Enforcement of Plant Variety Rights in Italy 2013."]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status at UPOV ==

Since 1988 CIOPORA has been participating in the [[UPOV]] Council sessions open for non-governmental organizations. Currently, along with its independent observer status,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upov.int/export/sites/upov/members/en/pdf/list_of_observers_in_upov_bodies.pdf "List of observers in UPOV bodies"]&lt;/ref&gt; CIOPORA participates in the Administrative and Legal Committee (CAJ), Technical Committee (TC), Technical Working Party for Fruits (TWF), Technical Working Party for Ornamental Plants and Forest Trees (TWO), as well as in the Working Group on Biochemical and Molecular Techniques, and DNA-Profiling in Particular (BMT) of the UPOV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upov.int/about/en/organigram.html "UPOV Organigram"]&lt;/ref&gt; CIOPORA has contributed to all three acts of the UPOV Convention (1961, 1978 and 1991)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upov.int/upovlex/en/acts.html "Texts of the Acts of the UPOV Convention"]&lt;/ref&gt; and submitted its feedback in the process of development of numerous other documents and regulations by UPOV regarding such topics as variety denominations, examination of Distinctness, Uniformity and Stability, harvested material, Essentially Derived Varieties, enforcement of breeders’ rights, etc.

== Structure ==

The supreme authority of CIOPORA is the [[Annual General Meeting]] (AGM) of its members&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aiph.org/site/index_en.cfm?act=nieuws.detail&amp;varnieuws=1522# |title="AIPH News: CIOPORA's AGM in Angers, France, April 22-25, 2013" |access-date=2013-12-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125195010/http://www.aiph.org/site/index_en.cfm?act=nieuws.detail&amp;varnieuws=1522# |archive-date=2014-11-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AGM of CIOPORA is held at least once a year. The date and venue, as well as the agenda of each year’s AGM are determined by the Board of CIOPORA. An extraordinary General Meeting can be convened on the proposals of the Board or of at least one fifth of the breeder members of the association.&lt;ref name="bylaws"&gt;[http://www.ciopora.org/fileadmin/assets/pageDownloads/CIOPORA_Papers/Bylaws/Bylaws_of_CIOPORA_04_2008.pdf "Bylaws of CIOPORA"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The general management and the control over the affairs of the association are entrusted to its Board headed by the President. The Board of CIOPORA is composed at least of eight and no more than eleven members of the association, including the President. The President and the candidates for the Board are nominated by the Board and are elected by [[secret ballot]] of the AGM for a term of three years. The President of CIOPORA can be reelected once. The Board of CIOPORA chooses the [[Vice president]] and the [[Treasurer]] of the association from its ranks. The Board of the association meets at least two, and usually four times a year.&lt;ref name="bylaws" /&gt;

The administrative office of CIOPORA is located in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]. It is headed by the Secretary General designated by the Board as a representative of CIOPORA in all external communication activities of the association targeted at the achievement of the CIOPORA's goals and objectives. The [[Secretary-General|Secretary General]] handles the accounts and is in charge of all the administrative matters of the association.&lt;ref name="bylaws" /&gt;

The members of CIOPORA can create groups within the structure of the association, such as [[crop]] sections and working groups. Currently there are five active crop sections within the structure of the association: [[Carnation]], Cut [[Rose]] (IRBA), [[Fruit]], [[Gypsophila]] and [[Houseplant|Pot Plants]].&lt;ref name="CIOPORA Crop Sections"&gt;[http://www.ciopora.org/association/structure/crop-sections/ CIOPORA Crop Sections]&lt;/ref&gt; Working groups are created with the goal to work on a particular topic. At the moment two Working Groups - Working Group on Molecular Techniques and Working Group on DUS (Distinctness, Uniformity and Stability)&lt;ref name="CIOPORA Working Groups"&gt;[http://www.ciopora.org/association/structure/working-groups/ CIOPORA Working Groups]&lt;/ref&gt; – meet regularly in order to draft the positions of CIOPORA on the respective matters.

== Members and Supporters ==

Currently CIOPORA comprises over 124 members from 26 countries (November 2012).&lt;ref name="Members of CIOPORA"&gt;[http://www.ciopora.org/association/members/ List of CIOPORA members]&lt;/ref&gt; Single breeders and breeding companies from the horticultural and fruit sector, as well as title holders, breeder associations, IP lawyers and consultants active in the area of [[Intellectual Property]] Protection are eligible for membership in the association. The proportion of the different member groups is regulated in the [[bylaws]] of CIOPORA: the number of affiliate members, association members, lawyer members and honorary members must not exceed half the number of the breeder members in order to guarantee that CIOPORA remains primarily the community of breeders. Each membership candidacy is subject to approval by the CIOPORA Board. [[Natural person]]s and companies, which are prepared to support the objectives of CIOPORA, but do not qualify as members, may become supporters of the association. Currently, CIOPORA accounts for 6 supporters from four countries.&lt;ref name="Supporters of CIOPORA"&gt;[http://www.ciopora.org/association/supporters/ List of CIOPORA supporters]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==

Besides the [[Annual General Meeting]]s, CIOPORA organizes international conferences and seminars on [[Intellectual Property|IP]]-related topics within the framework of the educational services for its member community and interested parties.

'''Differential technological development''' is a strategy proposed by [[transhumanist]] philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] in which societies would seek to influence the sequence in which [[emerging technologies]] developed. On this approach, societies would strive to retard the development of harmful technologies and their applications, while accelerating the development of beneficial technologies, especially those that offer protection against the harmful ones.{{which|date=October 2016}}&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2002"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Paul Christiano]] believes that while accelerating technological progress appears to be one of the best ways to improve human welfare in the next few decades, a faster rate of growth cannot be equally important for the far future because growth must eventually saturate due to physical limits. Hence, from the perspective of the far future, differential technological development appears more crucial.&lt;ref name=Christiano2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christiano|first1=Paul|title=On Progress and Prosperity|url=http://effective-altruism.com/ea/9f/on_progress_and_prosperity/|website=Effective Altruism Forum|accessdate=21 October 2014|date=15 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|blog post on forum|date=July 2016}}

Inspired by Bostrom's proposal, [[Luke Muehlhauser]] and Anna Salamon suggested a more general project of "differential intellectual progress", in which society advances its wisdom, philosophical sophistication, and understanding of risks faster than its technological power.&lt;ref name=Muehlhauser2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muehlhauser|first=Luke|author2=Anna Salamon|title=Intelligence Explosion: Evidence and Import|date=2012|pages=18–19|url=http://intelligence.org/files/IE-EI.pdf|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|self-published paper|date=July 2016}}&lt;ref name=Muehlhauser2013&gt;{{cite book|last=Muehlhauser|first=Luke|title=Facing the Intelligence Explosion|date=2013|publisher=Machine Intelligence Research Institute|url=http://intelligenceexplosion.com/2012/ai-the-problem-with-solutions/|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|self-published paper|date=July 2016}} Brian Tomasik has expanded on this notion.&lt;ref name=Tomasik2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomasik|first1=Brian|title=Differential Intellectual Progress as a Positive-Sum Project|url=http://foundational-research.org/differential-intellectual-progress-as-a-positive-sum-project/|website=Foundational Research Institute|accessdate=18 February 2016|date=23 Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|self-published paper|date=July 2016}}

{{For2|Effects of economic inequality|[[Effects of economic inequality]]}}
[[File:Gini Coefficient World CIA Report.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|2014 differences in national income equality around the world as measured by the national [[Gini coefficient]]. The Gini coefficient is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 corresponds with perfect equality (where everyone has the same income) and 1 corresponds with absolute inequality (where one person has all the income, and everyone else has zero income).]]

'''Economic inequality''' covers a wide variety of topics. It can refer to either [[income distribution]], measuring the amount of money people are paid, or the [[distribution of wealth]], which captures the amount of wealth people own. Inequality among nations is covered in [[international inequality]] and [[list of countries by income equality|countries listed by income inequality]]. For the United States, see [[Income inequality in the United States|United States income inequality]], [[Wealth inequality in the United States|United States wealth inequality]], [[List of U.S. states by Gini coefficient|United States states by gini coefficient]] and [[causes of income inequality in the United States]].

Besides measurements between countries or states, there are important types of economic inequality between groups of people. For inequality based on race, see [[racial wage gap in the United States]]. For inequality based on gender, see [[gender pay gap]] and [[gender pay gap in the United States]].

Important types of economic measurements focus on [[wealth]], [[income]], and [[consumption (economics)|consumption]]. There are various numerical [[index (economics)|indices]] for measuring economic inequality. A widely used index is the [[Gini coefficient]], but there are also [[income inequality metrics|many other methods]].  Important concepts of equality include [[Equity (economics)|equity]], [[equality of outcome]], and [[equality of opportunity]].

Research suggests that greater inequality hinders the duration of growth but not its rate.&lt;ref name="The New Growth Evidence"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1257/jel.37.1.112 |title=The New Growth Evidence |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=112–56 |year=1999 |last1=Temple |first1=Jonathan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.10.038 |title=A Meta-Analytic Reassessment of the Effects of Inequality on Growth |journal=World Development |volume=78 |pages=386–400 |year=2016 |last1=Neves |first1=Pedro Cunha |last2=Afonso |first2=Óscar |last3=Silva |first3=Sandra Tavares }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas globalization has reduced global inequality (between nations), it has increased inequality within nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10433.html|title=The Globalization of Inequality|website=Princeton University Press|access-date=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Changes in the structure of households can play an important role. Single-headed households in OECD countries have risen from an average of 15% in the late 1980s to 20% in the mid-2000s, resulting in higher inequality.
* [[Assortative mating]] refers to the phenomenon of people marrying people with similar background, for example doctors marrying doctors rather than nurses. OECD found out that 40% of couples where both partners work belonged to the same or neighbouring earnings deciles compared with 33% some 20 years before.&lt;ref name="oecd-dws"&gt;{{cite book|title=Divided We Stand: Why Inequality Keeps Rising|date=2011|publisher=OECD|isbn=978-92-64-11953-6 |doi=10.1787/9789264119536-en}}{{page needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the bottom percentiles number of hours worked has decreased.&lt;ref name="oecd-dws"/&gt;
* The main reason for increasing inequality seems to be the difference between the demand for and supply of skills.&lt;ref name="oecd-dws"/&gt;
* Income inequality in OECD countries is at its highest level for the past half century. The ratio between the bottom 10% and the top 10% has increased from 1:7, to 1:9 in 25 years.&lt;ref name="oecd-dws"/&gt;
* There are tentative signs of a possible convergence of inequality levels towards a common and higher average level across OECD countries.&lt;ref name="oecd-dws"/&gt;
*  With very few exceptions (France, Japan, and Spain), the wages of the 10% best-paid workers have risen relative to those of the 10% lowest paid.&lt;ref name="oecd-dws"/&gt;

A 2011 OECD study investigated economic inequality in [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Income inequality in India|India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Russia]] and [[South Africa]]. It concluded that key sources of inequality in these countries include "a large, persistent [[informal sector]], widespread regional divides (e.g. urban-rural), gaps in access to education, and barriers to employment and career progression for women."&lt;ref name="oecd-dws"/&gt;

The existing data and estimates suggest a large increase in international (and more generally inter-macroregional) component between 1820 and 1960. It might have slightly decreased since that time at the expense of increasing inequality within countries.&lt;ref name="see for example Novotny 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00168-007-0113-y |title=On the measurement of regional inequality: Does spatial dimension of income inequality matter? |journal=The Annals of Regional Science |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=563–80 |year=2007 |last1=Novotný |first1=Josef }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Development Programme]] in 2014 asserted that greater investments in social security, jobs and laws that protect vulnerable populations are necessary to prevent widening income inequality ... &lt;!---- fluctuating food prices, disasters and conflict from reducing human development---&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Anderson (July 24, 2014).

There is a significant difference in the measured wealth distribution and the public's understanding of wealth distribution. Michael Norton of the [[Harvard Business School]] and Dan Ariely of the Department of Psychology at [[Duke University]] found this to be true in their research, done in 2011. The actual wealth going to the top quintile in 2011 was around 84% where as the average amount of wealth that the general public estimated to go to the top quintile was around 58%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1745691610393524 |pmid=26162108 |title=Building a Better America—One Wealth Quintile at a Time |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=9–12 |year=2011 |last1=Norton |first1=Michael I. |last2=Ariely |first2=Dan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two researchers claim that global income inequality is decreasing, due to strong economic growth in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hellebrandt|author2=Mauro|title=The Future of Worldwide Income Distribution}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the OECD reported in 2015 that income inequality is higher than it has ever been within OECD member nations and is at increased levels in many emerging economies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/reducing-gender-gaps-and-poor-job-quality-essential-to-tackle-growing-inequality.htm Improving job quality and reducing gender gaps are essential to tackling growing inequality]. [[OECD]], May 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a June 2015 report by the [[International Monetary Fund]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Widening income inequality is the defining challenge of our time. In advanced economies, the gap between the rich and poor is at its highest level in decades. Inequality trends have been more mixed in emerging markets and developing countries (EMDCs), with some countries experiencing declining inequality, but pervasive inequities in access to education, health care, and finance remain.&lt;ref&gt;Era Dabla-Norris; Kalpana Kochhar; Nujin Suphaphiphat; Frantisek Ricka; Evridiki Tsounta (June 15, 2015).

Retrieved June 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In October 2017, the IMF warned that inequality within nations, in spite of global inequality falling in recent decades, has risen so sharply that it threatens economic growth and could result in further [[Polarization (politics)|political polarization]]. The Fund's Fiscal Monitor report said that "progressive taxation and transfers are key components of efficient fiscal redistribution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Dunsmuir

Income inequality in the US is significantly worse than people think.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2014/09/americans_have_no_idea_how_bad_inequality_is_new_harvard_business_school.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/kiatpongsan%20norton%202014_f02b004a-c2de-4358-9811-ea273d372af7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018 [[Oxfam]]  published a ''Reducing Inequality Index'' which measured social spending, tax and workers' rights to show which countries were best at closing the gap between rich and poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lawson |first1=Max |last2=Martin |first2=Matthew |title=The Commitment to Reducing Inequality Index 2018 |url=https://www.oxfam.org/en/research/commitment-reducing-inequality-index-2018 |accessdate=13 November 2018 |publisher=Oxfam |date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wealth distribution within individual countries===
{{main|List of countries by distribution of wealth}}
The following table shows information about wealth distribution in different countries, from a 2013 report by [[Crédit Suisse]]. Wealth can be negative for people who are in debt, and if there are enough people in debt in a country, the [[Gini coefficient]] can be greater than 100%, as seen in the case of Denmark. The Gini coefficients for wealth are often much higher than those for income. This is the case for example in Scandinavian countries such as Sweden and Finland. For example, in Sweden about 24% of households have negative wealth (or zero). This seems to be due to factors such as social insurance programmes ([[welfare]]) and the public [[pension]] scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accounting for Swedish wealth inequality|first1=David|last1=Domeij|first2=Paul|last2=Klein|date=January 2000|url=http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/es2000/0883.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030519155531/https://www.econometricsociety.org/meetings/wc00/pdf/0883.pdf|archivedate=May 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Income distribution within individual countries===
[[File:2014 Gini Index World Map, income inequality distribution by country per World Bank.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Countries' income inequality according to their most recent reported Gini index values (often 10+ years old) as of 2014:&lt;br /&gt;red = high, green = low inequality]]
{{Main|List of countries by income equality}}
A [[Gini index]] value above 50 is considered high; countries including Brazil, Colombia, South Africa, Botswana, and Honduras can be found in this category. A Gini index value of 30 or above is considered medium; countries including Vietnam, Mexico, Poland, The United States, Argentina, Russia and Uruguay can be found in this category. A Gini index value lower than 30 is considered low; countries including Austria, Germany, Denmark, Slovenia, Sweden and Ukraine can be found in this category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2172rank.html |title=Country Comparison: Distribution of family income – Gini index |website=The World Factbook |publisher=CIA |access-date=May 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives==
===Fairness vs. equality===
According to Christina Starmans et al. (Nature Hum. Beh., 2017), the research literature contains no evidence on people having an aversion on inequality. In all studies analyzed, the subjects preferred fair distributions to equal distributions, in both laboratory and real-world situations. In public, researchers may loosely speak of equality instead of fairness, when referring to studies where fairness happens to coincide with equality, but in many studies fairness is carefully separated from equality and the results are univocal. Already very young children seem to prefer fairness over equality.&lt;ref name="Starmans, Sheskin &amp; Bloom 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0082 |title=Why people prefer unequal societies |journal=Nature Human Behaviour |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=0082 |year=2017 |last1=Starmans |first1=Christina |last2=Sheskin |first2=Mark |last3=Bloom |first3=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When people were asked, what would be the wealth of each quintile in their ideal society, they gave a 50-fold sum to the richest quintile than to the poorest quintile. The preference for inequality increases in adolescence, and so do the capabilities to favor fortune, effort and ability in the distribution.&lt;ref name="Starmans, Sheskin &amp; Bloom 2017"/&gt;

Preference for unequal distribution has been developed to the human race possibly because it allows for better co-operation and allows a person to work with a more productive person so that both parties benefit from the co-operation. Inequality also solves the problems of free-riders, cheaters and ill-behaving people.&lt;ref name="Starmans, Sheskin &amp; Bloom 2017"/&gt;

In many societies, such as the USSR, the distribution lead to anger, as it was felt too equal, unfair. In the current U.S., many feel that the distribution is unfair in being too unequal. In both cases, the cause is unfairness, not inequality, the researchers conclude.&lt;ref name="Starmans, Sheskin &amp; Bloom 2017"/&gt;

===Socialist perspectives===
[[Socialist]]s attribute the vast disparities in wealth to the private ownership of the [[means of production]] by a class of owners, creating a situation where a small portion of the population lives off [[unearned income|unearned]] [[property income]] by virtue of ownership titles in capital equipment, financial assets and corporate stock. By contrast, the vast majority of the population is dependent on income in the form of a wage or salary. In order to rectify this situation, socialists argue that the means of production should be [[Social ownership|socially owned]] so that income differentials would be reflective of [[To each according to his contribution|individual contributions]] to the social product.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Goodwin. Using Political Ideas. West Sussex, England, UK: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd., 2007. p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marxist socialists ultimately predict the emergence of a [[communist society]] based on the common ownership of the means of production, where each individual citizen would have free access to the articles of consumption (''[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]''). According to Marxist philosophy, equality in the sense of free access is essential for freeing individuals from dependent relationships, thereby allowing them to transcend [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://econc10.bu.edu/okyn/OKpers/Income_Distribution/Edusex_indi/edusex_normative_view.htm |title=The Normative View of Marxian Theory on Income Distribution under Socialism |author=Oldrich Kyn |publisher= |accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meritocracy===
[[Meritocracy]] favors an eventual society where an individual's success is a direct function of his merit, or contribution. Economic inequality would be a natural consequence of the wide range in individual skill, talent and effort in human population. [[David Landes]] stated that the progression of Western economic development that led to the [[Industrial Revolution]] was facilitated by men advancing through their own merit rather than because of family or political connections.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberal perspectives===
Most modern [[social liberalism|social liberals]], including centrist or left-of-center political groups, believe that the capitalist economic system should be fundamentally preserved, but the status quo regarding the income gap must be reformed. Social liberals favor a capitalist system with active [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] macroeconomic policies and progressive taxation (to even out differences in income inequality).

However, contemporary [[classical liberals]] and [[libertarians]] generally do not take a stance on wealth inequality, but believe in [[legal egalitarianism|equality under the law]] regardless of whether it leads to unequal wealth distribution.  In 1966 [[Ludwig von Mises]], a prominent figure in the [[Austrian School]] of economic thought, explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The liberal champions of equality under the law were fully aware of the fact that men are born unequal and that it is precisely their inequality that generates social cooperation and civilization. Equality under the law was in their opinion not designed to correct the inexorable facts of the universe and to make natural inequality disappear. It was, on the contrary, the device to secure for the whole of mankind the maximum of benefits it can derive from it. Henceforth no man-made institutions should prevent a man from attaining that station in which he can best serve his fellow citizens.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Robert Nozick]] argued that government redistributes wealth by force (usually in the form of taxation), and that the ideal moral society would be one where all individuals are free from force.  However, Nozick recognized that some modern economic inequalities were the result of forceful taking of property, and a certain amount of redistribution would be justified to compensate for this force but not because of the inequalities themselves. [[John Rawls]] argued in ''[[A Theory of Justice]]''&lt;ref name="RawlsJustice"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rawls |first=John |authorlink=John Rawls |title=A Theory of Justice |year=2005 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0674017726|title-link=A Theory of Justice }}&lt;/ref&gt; that inequalities in the distribution of wealth are only justified when they improve society as a whole, including the poorest members.  Rawls does not discuss the full implications of his theory of justice.  Some see Rawls's argument as a justification for [[capitalism]] since even the poorest members of society theoretically benefit from increased innovations under capitalism; others believe only a strong [[welfare state]] can satisfy Rawls's theory of justice.

Classical liberal [[Milton Friedman]] believed that if government action is taken in pursuit of economic equality then political freedom would suffer. In a famous quote, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A society that puts equality before freedom will get neither. A society that puts freedom before equality will get a high degree of both.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Economist [[Tyler Cowen]] has argued that though income inequality has increased within nations, globally it has fallen over the last 20 years. He argues that though income inequality may make individual nations worse off, overall, the world has improved as global inequality has been reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cowen|first1=Tyler|title=Income Inequality Is Not Rising Globally. It's Falling.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/upshot/income-inequality-is-not-rising-globally-its-falling-.html|accessdate=July 26, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social justice arguments===
Patrick Diamond and Anthony Giddens (professors of Economics and Sociology, respectively) hold that 'pure [[meritocracy]] is incoherent because, without redistribution, one generation's successful individuals would become the next generation's embedded caste, hoarding the wealth they had accumulated'.

They also state that [[social justice]] requires redistribution of high incomes and large concentrations of wealth in a way that spreads it more widely, in order to "recognise the contribution made by all sections of the community to building the nation's wealth." (Patrick Diamond and [[Anthony Giddens]], June 27, 2005, New Statesman)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/nssubsfilter.php3?newTemplate=NSArticle_NS&amp;newDisplayURN=200506270022 New Statesman – NS Essay – 'Accumulation of wealth is unjust where it arises not from hard work and risk-taking enterprise, but from ''brute luck'' factors such as returns from property. Inheritance is a form of brute-luck inequality'.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Francis]] stated in his ''[[Evangelii gaudium]]'', that "as long as the problems of the poor are not radically resolved by rejecting the absolute autonomy of markets and financial speculation and by attacking the structural causes of inequality, no solution will be found for the world's problems or, for that matter, to any problems."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Nichols (journalist)|John Nichols]] (December 2, 2013).

Retrieved December 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He later declared that "inequality is the root of social evil."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Brown (April 28, 2014). [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/28/pope-francis-condemns-inequality-john-paul Pope Francis condemns inequality, thus refusing to play the game]. ''The Guardian.'' Retrieved May 27, 2014.&lt;!--Expanded quote from the ''Evangelii gaudium'' for clarification purposes: "Just as the commandment 'Thou shalt not kill' sets a clear limit in order to safeguard the value of human life, today we also have to say 'Thou shalt not' to an economy of exclusion and inequality. Such an economy kills … Today everything comes under the laws of competition and the survival of the fittest, where the powerful feed upon the powerless. As a consequence, masses of people find themselves excluded and marginalised: without work, without possibilities, without any means of escape. Human beings are themselves considered consumer goods to be used and then discarded."--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

When income inequality is low, [[aggregate demand]] will be relatively high, because more people who want ordinary [[consumer good]]s and services will be able to afford them, while the [[labor force]] will not be as relatively [[monopolization|monopolized]] by the wealthy.&lt;ref name=pigou&gt;''[http://www.econlib.org/library/NPDBooks/Pigou/pgEW8.html The Economics of Welfare]''| [[Arthur Cecil Pigou]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on social welfare===
In most western democracies, the desire to eliminate or reduce economic inequality is generally associated with the [[political left]]. One practical argument in favor of reduction is the idea that economic inequality reduces [[social cohesion]] and increases [[social unrest]], thereby weakening the society. There is evidence that this is true (see [[inequity aversion]]) and it is intuitive, at least for small face-to-face groups of people.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} [[Alberto Alesina]], [[Rafael Di Tella]], and Robert MacCulloch find that inequality negatively affects [[happiness]] in Europe but not in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cepr.org/pubs/dps/DP2877.asp Inequality and Happiness: Are Europeans and Americans Different?]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201195135/http://www.cepr.org/pubs/dps/DP2877.asp |date=February 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that economic inequality invariably translates to political inequality, which further aggravates the problem. Even in cases where an increase in economic inequality makes nobody economically poorer, an increased inequality of resources is disadvantageous, as increased economic inequality can lead to a power shift due to an increased inequality in the ability to participate in democratic processes.&lt;ref&gt;The relation between economic inequality and political inequality is explained by [[Robert Alan Dahl]] in the chapters ''The Presence of a Market Economy'' (p. 63), ''The Distribution of Political Resources'' (p. 84) und ''Market Capitalism and Human Dispositions'' (p. 87) in ''On Political Equality'', 2006, 120 pages, Yale University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-300-12687-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capabilities approach===
{{Further|Capability approach}}

The capabilities approach – sometimes called the human development approach – looks at income inequality and poverty as form of "capability deprivation".&lt;ref name="sen development"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[neoliberalism]], which "defines well-being as utility maximization", economic growth and income are considered a means to an end rather than the end itself.{{sfn|Fukuda-Parr|2003}} Its goal is to "wid[en] people's choices and the level of their achieved well-being"&lt;ref name="UNDP"&gt;[http://hdr.undp.org/en], UNDP (1990) Human Deuelopment Report, Oxford University Press, New York&lt;/ref&gt; through increasing functionings (the things a person values doing), capabilities (the freedom to enjoy functionings) and agency (the ability to pursue valued goals).&lt;ref name=Deneulin_Alkire&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Deneulin | first1 = Séverine | last2 = Alkire | first2 = Sabina | author-link1 = Séverine Deneulin| author-link2 = Sabina Alkire | contribution = The human development and capability approach | editor-last1 = Deneulin | editor-first1 = Séverine | editor-last2 = Shahani | editor-first2 = Lila | editor-link1 = Séverine Deneulin | title = An introduction to the human development and capability approach freedom and agency | pages = 22–48 | publisher = Earthscan International Development Research Centre | location = Sterling, Virginia Ottawa, Ontario | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781844078066 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a person's capabilities are lowered, they are in some way deprived of earning as much income as they would otherwise. An old, ill man cannot earn as much as a healthy young man; [[gender role]]s and customs may prevent a woman from receiving an education or working outside the home. There may be an epidemic that causes widespread panic, or there could be rampant violence in the area that prevents people from going to work for fear of their lives.&lt;ref name="sen development" /&gt; As a result, income and economic inequality increases, and it becomes more difficult to reduce the gap without additional aid. To prevent such inequality, this approach believes it's important to have political freedom, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and protective security to ensure that people aren't denied their functionings, capabilities, and agency and can thus work towards a better relevant income.

A 2017 study in the ''Journal of Political Economy'' by Daron Acemogu, James Robinson and Thierry Verdier argues that American "cutthroat" capitalism and inequality gives rise to technology and innovation that more "cuddly" forms of capitalism cannot.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/693038 |title=Asymmetric Growth and Institutions in an Interdependent World |journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=125 |issue=5 |pages=1245–1305 |year=2017 |last1=Acemoglu |first1=Daron |last2=Robinson |first2=James A. |last3=Verdier |first3=Thierry }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, "the diversity of institutions we observe among relatively advanced countries, ranging from greater inequality and risk-taking in the United States to the more egalitarian societies supported by a strong safety net in Scandinavia, rather than reflecting differences in fundamentals between the citizens of these societies, may emerge as a mutually self-reinforcing world equilibrium.

==Mitigating factors==

The relative merits and effectiveness of each approach is a subject of debate.

Typical [[government]] initiatives to reduce economic inequality include:
* [[Public education]]: increasing the supply of skilled labor and reducing income inequality due to education differentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/jda.0.0052 |jstor=40376250 |title=How Can Education Policy Improve Income Distribution?: An Empirical Analysis of Education Stages and Measures on Income Inequality |journal=The Journal of Developing Areas |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=51–77 |year=2010 |last1=Keller |first1=Katarina R.I. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Progressive tax]]ation: the rich are taxed proportionally more than the poor, reducing the amount of income inequality in society if the change in taxation does not cause changes in income.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Market forces]] outside of government intervention that can reduce economic inequality include:
* [[Marginal propensity to consume|propensity to spend]]: with rising wealth &amp; income, a person may spend more. In an extreme example, if one person owned everything, they would immediately need to hire people to maintain their properties, thus reducing the [[wealth concentration]].{{sfn|García-Peñalosa|Turnovsky|2007}}

==Various proposed causes of economic inequality{{anchor|Causes}}==
There are various reasons for economic inequality within societies. Recent growth in overall income inequality, at least within the OECD countries, has been driven mostly by increasing inequality in wages and salaries.&lt;ref name="PR divided"/&gt;

Economist [[Thomas Piketty]] argues that widening economic disparity is an inevitable phenomenon of [[free market]] [[capitalism]] when the rate of return of capital (r) is greater than the rate of growth of the economy (g).&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Piketty|Piketty, Thomas]] (2014). ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]].'' [[Belknap Press]]. {{ISBN|067443000X}} p. 571&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour market===
{{main|Labour economics|Capitalism|Marxism|Neoclassical economics}}

A major cause of economic inequality within modern [[market economy|market economies]] is the determination of wages by the [[labor market|market]]. Where competition is imperfect; information unevenly distributed; opportunities to acquire education and skills unequal [[market failure]] results. Since many such imperfect conditions exist in virtually every market, there is in fact little presumption that markets are in general efficient. This means that there is an enormous potential role for government to correct  such market failures.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E. (June 4, 2012).

===Taxes===

Another cause is the rate at which [[income tax|income is taxed]] coupled with the progressivity of the tax system. A [[progressive tax]] is a tax by which the [[tax rate]] increases as the taxable base amount increases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Progressive Webster] (4b): increasing in rate as the base increases (a progressive tax)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/69/P0586900.html American Heritage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209142138/http://bartleby.com/61/69/P0586900.html |date=February 9, 2009 }} (6).

Madeo, Kenneth E. Anderson, Betty R. Jackson (1992), ''Concepts of Taxation'', Dryden Press: Fort Worth, TX&lt;/ref&gt; In a progressive tax system, the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society, either increasing it or decreasing it, provided that income does not change as a result of the change in tax regime. Additionally, steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a [[Redistribution of income and wealth|more equal distribution of income]] across the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alesina|first=Alberto|author2=Dani Rodrick|title=Distributive Politics and Economic Growth|journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics|date=May 1994|volume=109|issue=2|pages=465–90 |doi=10.2307/2118470|url=http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/109/2/465.full.pdf|accessdate=October 17, 2013|jstor=2118470}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between the [[Gini index]] for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=More than a Dozen Alternative Ways of Spelling Gini|author=Shlomo Yitzhaki|journal=Economic Inequality|volume=8|year=1998|pages=13–30 |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTDECINEQ/Resources/morethan2002.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
{{main|Education}}

[[File:Going up or down advertisement.jpg|thumb|Illustration from a 1916 advertisement for a vocational school in the back of a US magazine.  Education has been seen as a key to higher income, and this advertisement appealed to Americans' belief in the possibility of self-betterment, as well as threatening the consequences of downward mobility in the great [[income inequality]] existing during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. ]]

An important factor in the creation of inequality is variation in individuals' access to education.&lt;ref name="becker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.american.com/archive/2007/may-june-magazine-contents/the-upside-of-income-inequality|title=The Upside of Income Inequality|last=Becker|first=Gary S.|date=May 2007|publisher=The America|author2=Murphy, Kevin M.|accessdate=January 8, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102212816/http://www.american.com/archive/2007/may-june-magazine-contents/the-upside-of-income-inequality/|archive-date=January 2, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education, especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers, creates high wages for those with this education,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |first= Barry |last= Bosworth |first2= Gary |last2= Burtless |first3= C.

As a result, those who are unable to afford an education, or choose not to pursue optional education, generally receive much lower wages. The justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes, and thus lower aggregate savings and investment. Conversely, education raises incomes and promotes growth because it helps to unleash the productive potential of the poor.

===Economic liberalism, deregulation and decline of unions===
{{Main|Economic liberalism|Deregulation|Labor unions in the United States}}

John Schmitt and Ben Zipperer (2006) of the CEPR point to [[economic liberalism]] and the reduction of business [[regulation]] along with the decline of [[union membership]] as one of the causes of economic inequality.  In an analysis of the effects of intensive Anglo-American [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] policies in comparison to continental European liberalism, where unions have remained strong, they concluded "The U.S. economic and social model is associated with substantial levels of social exclusion, including high levels of income inequality, high relative and absolute poverty rates, poor and unequal educational outcomes, poor health outcomes, and high rates of crime and incarceration. At the same time, the available evidence provides little support for the view that U.S.-style [[labour market flexibility|labor market flexibility]] dramatically improves labor-market outcomes. Despite popular prejudices to the contrary, the U.S. economy consistently affords a lower level of economic mobility than all the continental European countries for which data is available."&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, John and Ben Zipperer. 2006. "[http://www.cepr.net/documents/social_exclusion_2006_08.pdf Is the U.S. a Good Model for Reducing Social Exclusion in Europe?]" CEPR&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the [[International Monetary Fund]] has published studies which found that the decline of unionization in many advanced economies and the establishment of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economics have fueled rising income inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hiltzik (March 25, 2015). [http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-imf-agrees-loss-of-union-power-20150325-column.html IMF agrees: Decline of union power has increased income inequality]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]].''

=== Information technology===
{{main|Digital Revolution|Information Technology}}
The growth in importance of [[information technology]] has been credited with increasing income inequality.&lt;ref name="Basu-2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Basu|first1=Kaushik|title=Is technology making inequality worse?|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/is-technology-making-inequality-worse/|website=World Economic Forum|accessdate=November 17, 2017|date=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology has been called "the main driver of the recent increases in inequality" by Erik Brynjolfsson, of [[MIT]].&lt;ref name="Rotman-2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rotman|first1=David|title=Technology and Inequality|journal=MIT Technology Review|date=October 21, 2014|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/531726/technology-and-inequality/|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In arguing against this explanation, Jonathan Rothwell notes that if technological advancement is measured by high rates of invention, there is a negative correlation between it and inequality. Countries with high invention rates — "as measured by patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty" — exhibit lower inequality than those with less.  In one country, the United States, "salaries of engineers and software developers rarely reach" above $390,000/year (the lower limit for the top 1% earners).&lt;ref name="NYT-17-11-2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rothwell|first1=Jonathan|title=Myths of the 1 Percent: What's Putting People at the Top|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/upshot/income-inequality-united-states.html?action=click&amp;module=MoreInSection&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;region=Footer&amp;contentCollection=The%20Upshot|accessdate=November 17, 2017|agency=New York Times|date=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising [[income inequality in the United States|inequality in the United States]]. He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the [[means of production]], resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable.

In many countries, there is a [[gender pay gap]] in favor of males in the [[labor market]]. Several factors other than discrimination may contribute to this gap. On average, women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay when looking for work, and may be less willing to travel or relocate.&lt;ref name="Forbes 2006"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/ceonetwork/2006/05/12/women-wage-gap-cx_wf_0512earningmore.html | work=Forbes | title=Are Women Earning More Than Men? | date=May 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/02/AR2007040201262.html | work=The Washington Post | title=A Bargain At 77 Cents To a Dollar | first=Carrie | last=Lukas | date=April 3, 2007 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Sowell]], in his book [[Knowledge and Decisions]], claims that this difference is due to women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy, but income studies show that does not explain the entire difference.

=== Economic development ===
[[File:Kuznets curve.png|right|upright=1.45|thumb|A Kuznets curve]]

{{Main|Kuznets curve}}
Economist [[Simon Kuznets]] argued that levels of economic inequality are in large part the result of stages of [[economic development|development]]. According to Kuznets, countries with low levels of development have relatively equal distributions of wealth. As a country develops, it acquires more capital, which leads to the owners of this capital having more wealth and income and introducing inequality. Eventually, through various possible redistribution mechanisms such as [[social welfare]] programs, more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality.

===Wealth concentration===
{{Main|Wealth concentration|Billionaire}}
[[File:Jeff Bezos' iconic laugh.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Jeff Bezos]] is officially the richest person in the world.]]
Wealth concentration is the process by which, under certain conditions, newly created [[wealth]] concentrates in the possession of already-wealthy individuals or entities. Accordingly, those who already hold wealth have the means to [[invest]] in new sources of creating wealth or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth, thus are the beneficiaries of the new wealth. Over time, wealth concentration can significantly contribute to the persistence of inequality within society. Thomas Piketty in his book ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'' argues that the fundamental force for divergence is the usually greater return of capital (r) than economic growth (g), and that larger fortunes generate higher returns.&lt;ref&gt;pp.&amp;nbsp;384 Table 12.2, ''U.S. university endowment size vs. real annual rate of return''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rent seeking===
{{main|Rent-seeking}}
Economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] argues that rather than explaining concentrations of wealth and income, market forces should serve as a brake on such concentration, which may better be explained by the non-market force known as "[[rent-seeking]]".  While the market will bid up compensation for rare and desired skills to reward wealth creation, greater productivity, etc., it will also prevent successful entrepreneurs from earning excess profits by fostering competition to cut prices, profits and large compensation.&lt;ref name="stiglitz.p35"&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E. (June 4, 2012). The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future (pp. 30–1, 35–6). Norton. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; A better explainer of growing inequality, according to Stiglitz, is the use of political power generated by wealth by certain groups to shape government policies financially beneficial to them.  This process, known to economists as [[rent-seeking]], brings income not from creation of wealth but from "grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort"&lt;ref name="stiglitz.p32"&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E. (June 4, 2012). The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future (p. 32). Norton. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finance industry===
[[Jamie Galbraith]] argues that countries with larger financial sectors have greater inequality, and the link is not an accident.&lt;ref&gt;James K. Galbraith, ''Inequality and Instability: A Study of the World Economy Just before the Great Crisis'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E. (June 4, 2012). ''The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future'', p. 334. Norton. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal was established in 1996 in order to support the teaching and general knowledge of the members of the association and others involved in teaching. All articles are available free online. The founding and current [[editor-in-chief]] is Lucien Ellington ([[University of Tennessee at Chattanooga]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.asian-studies.org/EAA/EAA-TOC-SearchS.asp Volume 1 No 1 (Spring 1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Falter im Wind"''' ([[English Language|English]] translation: "Butterfly In The Wind") was the [[Austria]]n entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972]], performed in [[German Language|German]] by [[Milestones (Austrian band)|Milestones]].

The song was performed eleventh on the night (following [[Finland]]'s [[Päivi Paunu]] and [[Kim Floor]] with "[[Muistathan]]" and preceding [[Italy]]'s [[Nicola Di Bari]] with "[[I giorni dell'arcobaleno]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 100 points, placing it fifth in a field of 18 songs.

The song is a folk-influenced number, directed at the titular butterfly and dealing with the impermanence of life. A version in English was recorded by The Milestones as "Dance Butterfly".&lt;ref&gt;Philips 6015 042&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to disagreements over the voting structure, Austria did not enter the Contest from [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]] to [[Eurovision Song Contest 1975|1975]]. The song was thus succeeded as [[Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest|Austrian representative]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1976|1976 Contest]] by [[Waterloo &amp; Robinson]], performing "[[My Little World (song)|My Little World]]".

'''Les Ballets de Monte-Carlo''' (The Monte Carlo Ballet) is a [[classical ballet]] company established in 1985 by [[Caroline, Princess of Hanover|the Princess of Hanover]] in accordance with the wishes of her mother, [[Grace Kelly|Princess Grace of Monaco]].  It is the official national company of [[Monaco|the Principality of Monaco]].

==History==
The first performance took place on 21 December 1985, casting among others several guest stars of the [[Opéra National de Paris|Paris Opera]]. Directed by Ghislaine Thesmar and [[Pierre Lacotte]], the company rehearsed in the Diaghilev studio, performing on the stage of the Salle Garnier at the [[Monte Carlo Opera]] and immediately started touring. Their repertoire includes works from the [[Ballets Russes]] and contemporary pieces from guest [[choreography|choreographer]]s such as Kevin Haigen, John Clifford, [[Jean-Christophe Maillot]], Dieter Amman, and Uwe Scholz. In 1989, Jean Yves Esquerre became artistic director, after the departure of Ghislaine Thesmar and Pierre Lacotte one year earlier.

In 1992, Jean-Christophe Maillot joined the company, first as artistic consultant, and was officially promoted to the rank of director-choreographer in September 1993. Four years later, thanks to his vision and his energy, the ''Ballets de Monte-Carlo'' left the building that had been their historical home, which had by then become too small, and moved into their own dance center: L'ATELIER. Further, in December 2000, they inaugurated their first ballet season on the huge stage of the [[Salle des Princes]] at the brand new congress center in Monaco, the [[Grimaldi Forum]]. These were two turning points in the modern history of the company and the beginning of a new dance era in Monaco.

'''General elections''' were held in [[Liechtenstein]] on 7 February 1993.

Note that the total number of votes is lower than the total for the parties, as each voter has as many votes as there are seats in a constituency, and thus can cast multiple votes.

Among the [[Nenets people]] of [[Siberia]], the male '''Num''' was the sky god, the good creator of earth and the high god of the Nenets. Num is one of two [[demiurge]]s, or supreme gods.  The Nenets believed earth and all living things were created by the god Num and every heavenly sphere is ruled by one son of the Num god. [[Nga (god)|Nga]] was his malevolent son. 

According to one story, the world threatened to collapse on itself. To try to halt this cataclysm a [[shaman]] sought the advice of [[Num (God)|Num]]. The shaman was advised to travel below the earth, to Nga's domain and call upon him. The shaman did as told and was wed with Nga's daughter. After that point he began to support the world in his hand and became known as "The Old Man of the Earth."

In another myth, Num and Nga create the world, collaborating and also competing with each other — the myth is an example of [[dualistic cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;Vértes 1990: 104–105&lt;/ref&gt;

The word Num means heaven in [[Nenets languages|Nenets]].

'''Orbita''' ({{lang-ru|орбита}}) is a Soviet-Russian [[system]] of broadcasting and delivering [[TV]] signals via satellites. It is considered to be the first national [[television network|network]] of [[satellite television]].
[[File:Орбита в Хабаровске лето 1977.jpg|thumb|Orbita ground station. [[Khabarovsk]]. 1977]]
The Orbita  system is based on [[communication satellite]]s in highly elliptical [[Molniya orbit]]s, as well as on many ground [[downlink]] TV stations for reception and relaying TV [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]]s to [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] of TV sets of many local areas. The full deployment of the Orbita satellite system took place on 25 October 1967 when ground [[downlink]] stations of some cities of Soviet [[Siberia]] and the Far East began to receive regular TV programmes from Moscow-based [[uplink]] [[Ground station|station]]s via a [[Satellite constellation|constellation]] of [[Molniya (satellite)|Molniya satellites]].

[[File:Peno de la conquesta.jpg|right|thumb|The Pennon of the Conquest of Valencia by [[James I of Aragon]]]] 

The '''Pennon of the Conquest''' ({{lang-es|Pendón de la Conquista}}; [[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Penó de la Conquesta'') is the flag raised by the [[Moors]] of [[Valencia, Spain]], on September 28, 1238 on the tower of ''Alī-Bufāt'', later called ''Torre del Temple'', to indicate their surrender to the troops of king [[James I of Aragon]]. We know about this episode from the quote entered by the king himself in his Chronicle: "''We were in the riverbed, between the gardens and the tower; and when we saw our flag upon the tower, we dismounted from our horse, and heading eastwards we cried from our eyes and kissed the earth for the great mercy God had made to us''".

The Pennon is made of three pieces of white cloth (which the passage of time has turned into yellowish) sewed together, cut to give the flag a torus-shaped appearance, upon which 4 red stripes have been painted. It is about 2 m long and on top an epigraph reads ''año 1238'' ("year 1238"). After the Conquest of Valencia it was considered a [[relic]] and was kept by order of [[James I of Aragon]] in the Church at Saint Vincent Hospital up to the 19th century, when it was transferred to its current location in the City Hall of [[Valencia, Spain]].

{{Gold Coast (Ghana)}}

The '''Portuguese Gold Coast''' was a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colony]] on the West African [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]] (present-day [[Ghana]]) on the [[Gulf of Guinea]].

==History==
The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] established the following settlements on the Gold Coast from 21 January 1482: 
* Fort São Jorge da Mina de Ouro, modern [[Elmina]]: 21 January 1482 – 28–9 August 1637; this became the capital
* [[Fort Santo Antonio|Fort Santo António]] de Axim, modern [[Axim]]: 1486 – 1642
* Fort São Francisco Xavier, modern [[Osu, Accra|Osu]], district of [[Accra]]: 1640–1642
* Fort São Sebastião, modern [[Shama, Ghana|Shama]]: 1526–1637.

On 29 August 1637 the Dutch occupied São Jorge da Mina. 
On 9 January 1642 the whole colony was ceded to the Dutch, who made it part of their [[Dutch Gold Coast]] colony.

==Captains-major==
The Portuguese governors, going by this modest, military style, were:
*1482 – 1485 - [[Diogo de Azambuja]]
*1485 – 1486 - Álvaro Vaz Pestano
*148? – Álvaro Mascarenhas
*c.1487 – João Fogaça
*1495 – 1499 - [[Lopo Soares de Albergaria]]
*1499? – 1503? - Fernão Lopes Correia
*1503? – 1506? - [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]] 
*1506? – 1509? - António de Bobadilha

'''"Taiwan, China"'''&lt;!-- Please do not add official regional/minority languages here; use the langbox template directly above, included specifically for that purpose. --&gt;, '''"Taiwan, Province of China"''', or '''"Taiwan Province,  China"''' are a set of politically controversial and potentially ambiguous terms that characterize [[free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan and its associated territories]] as a [[provinces of China|province]] or territory of "[[China]]". The term, "Taiwan, China" is used by [[Media of China|Chinese media]] whenever Taiwan is referenced by [[media in China|Chinese media]]. In English, "China" is inserted after "Taiwan" by adding {{nowrap|", China"}}, per English grammar rules. In the [[Chinese language]], however, the [[Chinese characters]] {{lang|zh-hant|中國}} ("China") would be inserted in front of "{{lang|zh-hant|台灣}}" (Taiwan) per Chinese convention to indicate a country and its subdivisions. For example, the word "China" would be inserted into [[subtitle (captioning)|video captions]] on television, whenever a person mentions the word "Taiwan" but the characters {{lang|zh-hant|中國}} ("China") would be inserted in front of "Taiwan" ({{lang|zh-hant|台灣}}) despite the fact that the person never said the word "China", to [[propaganda|propagandize]] to the world that Taiwan is part of ''China''. (Video subtitling is standard practice in the Chinese language due to the existence of many mutually unintelligible "[[Chinese dialects]]".) The term "Taiwan, Province of China" also sometimes appears in the [[drop-down list|drop-down menu]] of websites and computer software that show a list of [[ISO 3166-1|ISO 3166-1 country names]] (see UN and ISO section below).&lt;ref name="ISO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taiwanmatters.blogspot.com/2010/05/how-iso-helps-china-change-taiwans.html| title=How the ISO helps China change Taiwan's status quo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms are contentious and potentially [[ambiguity|ambiguous]] because they relate to the controversial issues of the [[political status of Taiwan]] and [[Cross-Strait relations]] between "Taiwan" and "China", in that whether they are two separate countries or "two areas of one country". Since 1949, [[two Chinas|two countries with the name "China" (Two Chinas)]] actually exist, namely the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (ROC, founded 1912 and now commonly known as "[[Taiwan]]") and the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC, founded 1949 and now commonly known as "[[China]]", and "''the'' China"). However, only one "China" actually rules [[Taiwan]], namely Republic of China, and has an administrative division called "[[Taiwan Province]]" but refers to it as "Taiwan Province, Republic of China"; whereas, the other "China", namely the People's Republic of China, which is the one [[diplomatic recognition|internationally recognized]] as "China" (not the ROC), ''claims'' but does not control [[free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan]] as part of its territory.

The juxtaposition of "Taiwan" and "China" in this order into one single term "Taiwan, China" implicitly places the Taiwan under the sovereignty of PRC/"China", in the same sense as "California, USA". The use of this term is officially and politically sanctioned by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Chinese]] government as a way to claim and [[propaganda|propagandize]] that Taiwan is under its [[sovereignty]],&lt;ref name="CCTV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liuqiu-china.com/portal.php?mod=view&amp;aid=1094|script-title=zh:请央视自律 关于正确使用涉台宣传用语的意见}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the PRC claims to be the [[legitimacy (political)|legitimate government]] of "all China", which, according to its own definition, includes Taiwan also, despite its lack of control.  Some of the [[Government of the Republic of China|ROC government]] disputes the PRC position and it, along with Many of the [[Taiwanese people]], considers this term incorrect and offensive, in that its use is a lie which denies the ROC's sovereignty and existence, reducing Taiwan's status to a province of the PRC (see "[[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Taiwan, PRC]]"), and objects to its use.&lt;ref name="ROC May16"&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110517/wl_asia_afp/taiwanchinadiplimacywho| title=Taiwan protests "province of China" WHO label}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is particularly offensive to supporters of [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwan Independence]] and want to [[Taiwanization|disassociate]] Taiwan with "China" and a [[Chinese culture|Chinese identity]], (i.e., [[de-Sinicization|de-Sinicize]]), and consider it an [[oxymoron]], [[Id est|i.e.]] in the view that Taiwan and China are different countries, and that the [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the ROC's rule of Taiwan is disputed in the first place.

== Background and ambiguity over "China" ==
{{Further|Chinese Civil War}}

The dispute and ambiguity over the meaning of "China" and which "China" stemmed from the division of [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]] into [[two Chinas]] at the "end" of the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1955.{{efn|There is some debate whether the war has ended since the two Chinas are still fighting for international recognition and assurance of sovereignty. See [[Chinese Civil War]] for details.}} (Fighting between the two merely eased off after 1949 and no signing of a [[peace treaty]] or [[armistice]] ever occurred; the PRC still threatens attack on ROC/Taiwan when it deems necessary.) The term "China" historically meant the various regimes and imperial dynasties which controlled territories in mainland Asia prior to 1911, when the imperial system was overthrown and the Republic of China (ROC) was established as the first republic in Asia. In 1927, the Chinese Civil War started between the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT, founding party of the ROC) and the [[Communist Party of China]], a rebel force at the time. The Chinese Communists eventually won control of most of ROC's original territory ([[mainland China]]) in 1949, when they proclaimed the "People's Republic of China" (PRC) on that territory.

Since then, two Chinas have existed, although the PRC was not internationally recognized at the time. The Republic of China government, who received [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]] in 1945 from [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] then fled in 1949 to Taiwan with the aim to retake mainland China and retained the name "Republic of China". Both the ROC and the PRC still officially (constitutionally) claim mainland China and the [[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan Area]] as part of their respective territories. In reality, the PRC rules only Mainland China and has no control of but claims Taiwan as part of its territory under its "[[One-China Policy|One China Principle]]". The ROC, which only rules the [[Taiwan Area]] (composed of [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]] and [[List of islands of the Republic of China|its nearby minor islands]]), became known as "Taiwan" after its largest island, (an instance of ''[[pars pro toto]]''). It stopped active claim of mainland China as part of its territory after [[Constitution of the Republic of China|constitutional]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; reform in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sino.gov.tw/en/show_issue.php?id=200068906052e.txt&amp;cur_page=2&amp;table=2&amp;distype=&amp;h1=About%20Taiwan&amp;h2=Politics&amp;search=&amp;height=&amp;type=&amp;scope=&amp;order=&amp;keyword=&amp;lstPage=&amp;num=&amp;year=2000&amp;month=06 | title = A Pivotal President-- Lee Teng-hui's 12 Years | publisher = Taiwan Panorama (Sino)| date = 2000-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since the 2008 election of [[Ma Ying-jeou]], he again asserted that [[mainland China]] is part of Republic of China territory according to its constitution, and, in 2013, he stated that [[Cross-strait relations|relations between PRC and ROC]] are not between countries but "regions of the same country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Taiwan and China in 'special relations': Ma |publisher = China Post |date = 2008-09-04 |url = http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/china-taiwan%20relations/2008/09/04/173082/Taiwan-and.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.chinasmack.com/2013/stories/taiwan-president-mainland-china-is-still-our-territory.html |title =Taiwan President: Mainland China is Still Our Territory |publisher = ChinaSmack |date = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, the People's Republic of China won the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|United Nations seat as "China"]] and use of the name and expelled the ROC from the UN. Since then the term "Taiwan, China" is a designation typically used in international organizations like the United Nations and its associated organs under pressure from the PRC to accommodate its claim and to give the false impression that Taiwan belongs to the PRC. (The term "[[Chinese Taipei]]" was similarly created for the same purpose.) However, the [[political status of Taiwan]] is a complex and controversial issue and currently unresolved, in large part due to the United States and the [[Allies of World War II]] handling of the [[surrender of Japan|surrender of Taiwan from Japan]] in 1945 (which was to be a [[General Order No. 1|temporary administration]] by the ROC troops), and the [[Treaty of Peace with Japan]] ("Treaty of San Francisco") in 1951, for which neither the ROC nor the PRC was invited, and left Taiwan's sovereignty legally undefined in [[international law]] and [[political status of Taiwan|in dispute]].

== Ambiguity of "Taiwan Province" ==
{{Main|Taiwan Province}}
The term "Taiwan, (Province of) China" is also potentially ambiguous because both the ROC and the PRC each has administratively a "Taiwan Province", [[Taiwan Province|Taiwan Province, Republic of China]] and "[[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China]]", and neither of these provinces covers the Matsu Islands, Wuchiu, Kinmen, all of which have been retained by the Republic of China. Geographically speaking, they both refer to the same place. The existence of the extra term "Taiwan Province, PRC" is merely because of PRC's insistence that Taiwan is part of China. Without more specific indication, it is unclear to which "Taiwan Province" is being referred. However, since China (PRC) does not control Taiwan and its "Taiwan Province" exists only on paper, as a practical matter, "Taiwan Province" refers only to the Taiwan Province under Republic of China's administration.

Although the word "China" could also possibly be interpreted to mean "Republic of China", this interpretation is no longer common since "China" is typically understood as referring to the PRC after the ROC lost its [[China and the United Nations|UN seat as "China"]] in 1971, and is considered a term distinct from "Taiwan", the name with which the ROC has become identified. Also, only the ROC's Taiwan Province exists in reality and is under the ROC's actual territorial control, whereas the PRC's "Taiwan Province" exists only on paper, under the PRC's 
administrative structure but without an actual provincial government. Instead, the PRC has a [[Taiwan Affairs Office|Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council]] to deal with issues and policy guidelines relating to Taiwan.

The ROC also does not refer to its Taiwan Province as "Taiwan, China" in English but rather as "Taiwan Province, Republic of China" ({{zh|labels=no |t=中華民國臺灣省 |p=Zhōnghuá Mínguó Táiwānshěng}}), and typically such reference only occurs in the [[Chinese language]] in the ROC's official documents and as the marquee in the administrative offices of Taiwan Province government. However, references to the province is now rare since the [[Taiwan Provincial Government]] has largely been dissolved and its functions transferred to the central government or county governments since 1997. Therefore, recent uses of the term "Taiwan, Province of China" appears mainly in PRC-controlled media like CCTV ([[Chinese Central Television]]) and in the [[ISO 3166-1]] codes to convey the sense that Taiwan is part of ''its'' "China".&lt;ref name="CCTV"/&gt;

== Objections ==
=== ROC (Taiwan) government ===
Although the Republic of China is no longer a member of the United Nations, the term "Taiwan, China" has sometimes been used by the U.N. to refer to the Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_12_17/en/index.html| title=Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Taiwan, China | work=World Health Organization|date=2003-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The ROC is prohibited from using its official name internationally under pressure from the PRC and uses "[[Chinese Taipei]]" in other organizations.) The ROC sees its use as a denial of the ROC's status as a separate sovereign state, diminishing it under "China", which implicitly is the PRC. Various instances of the use of the term by international organizations or news media have been met with protest from the Taiwanese government officials and citizens.

In an incident on 10 May 2011, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), an [[List of specialized agencies of the United Nations|agency]] of the UN, referred to Taiwan as "Taiwan, China" in its documents. (The ROC participates in the WHO under the name "[[Chinese Taipei]]", due to political pressure from the PRC.) ROC president [[Ma Ying-jeou]] protested the WHO's action and accused the PRC of "pressuring the UN body into calling" the ROC "Chinese territory", and stated that Beijing's moves were "very negative" for [[Cross-strait relations|bilateral ties]].&lt;ref name="ROC Protest"&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://www2.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=306900|title=Taiwan president protests China pressuring UN body into calling island a Chinese territory|work=The Associated Press|publisher=Reading Eagle|date=2011-05-10|accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ma, who took office in 2008, has taken many measures to improve [[Cross-Strait relations]].

=== Taiwan Independence Supporters ===
{{Further|Taiwan independence}}
The confusion and fight over use of the "China" name and the lack of name recognition of "Republic of China" itself and [[Political status of Taiwan|recognition as a country]] are part of the reason for the supporters of [[Taiwan independence]] to push for an identity apart from "China" and for renaming the ROC and gaining [[diplomatic recognition|international recognition]] as "[[Taiwan independence movement|Republic of Taiwan]]". Some supporters also reject the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy of Republic of China]]'s takeover of Taiwan from Japan at the end of World War II since 1945 (due to the lack of transfer of sovereignty in the [[Treaty of Peace with Japan]]). They also view that Taiwan is no longer part of China since "China" is recognized by the UN as being the People's Republic of China (PRC) rather than the ROC/Taiwan, so placing "Taiwan" and "China" together in one term is not only incorrect and an [[oxymoron]] but also offensively denies the ROC's national [[sovereignty]] and existence and places it under China.

== Usage ==
=== The United Nations and the ISO ===
The term "Taiwan, Province of China" also appears in the [[International Organization for Standardization]]'s [[ISO 3166-1]] country codes because its information source, the publication ''UN Terminology Bulletin-Country Names'', lists Taiwan as "Taiwan, Province of China" due to the PRC's political influence in the United Nations as a member of the [[UN Security Council]]. Since the ISO 3166-1 code is commonly used as the data source for a complete list of country and territory names for computer programs and websites, "Taiwan, Province of China" is sometimes seen on [[dropdown menu]]s instead of "Taiwan" for this reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lin|first1=Keng-yu|last2=Tsai|first2=Rex|title=Taiwan listed as "Taiwan, Province of China"|url=https://bugs.launchpad.net/developer-ubuntu-com/+bug/885293|website=[[Launchpad (website)|Launchpad]]|publisher=Canonical Ltd.|accessdate=17 September 2016|date=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/170143/taiwan-is-not-a-province-of-china|title=Taiwan is not a province of China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== People's Republic of China ===
The term is often used in Chinese media whenever the word "''Taiwan''" is mentioned, as in news reports and in TV shows. Particularly, when Taiwanese entertainers are on talk shows or being interviewed, the Chinese subtitles on the TV screen would always say "Taiwan, China" ({{lang|zh-hans|中国台湾}} / {{lang|zh-hant|中國台灣}}) despite the fact the person never mentioned the word "China" ({{lang|zh-hans|中国}} / {{lang|zh-hant|中國}}), thereby putting words in the person's mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mangapower|url= http://www.want-daily.com/portal.php?mod=view&amp;aid=81393 |title=Pressured by "higher-ups paying attention", so UNI Yeh said "Taipei, China"|publisher=Apple Daily (in Chinese)|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (It is standard practice for Chinese television to display [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]] in all programs.) Also, there has been controversy about Chinese [[talent show]]s forcing Taiwanese contestants to introduce themselves as from "Taiwan, China" or from "[[Chinese Taipei]]." For example, Taiwanese singer  
[[:zh:葉瑋庭|Uni Yeh]], on her first appearance on the [[Voice of China]], introduced herself as being from "Pingtung District, China Taipei," which caused an uproar among Taiwanese [[netizens]]. Her response was that she was instructed to say so by the directors and was nervous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jianhong Wu|url= http://m.ent.appledaily.com.tw/section/article/entertainment/20130721/35164847 |title=UNI Yeh self-introduction  blunder of "Pingtung, China" on "Voice of China" criticized |publisher=Apple Daily (in Chinese)|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
If a place of birth on a [[United States passport]] application is written as "Taiwan, China" that cannot be shown in passports per [[One-China Policy]], the [[United States Department of State]] requires its officials to contact the applicant to ascertain whether "Taiwan" or "China" is preferred place of birth to be printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/08FAM/08FAM040304.html |title=8 FAM 403.4 Place of Birth |last= |first= |date=2018-06-27 |website=Foreign Affairs Manual |publisher=United States Department of State |access-date=2018-07-18 |quote="d. If an applicant born in Taiwan writes "Taiwan, China" as her/his POB on a passport application, you must contact the applicant to ascertain whether she/he prefers either TAIWAN or CHINA as her/his POB (Information Request Letter 707-06)."

===International airlines===
In April, 2018, the [[China Civil Aviation Authority]], wrote a letter to 36 airlines throughout the world, including US Airlines [[Delta Airlines|Delta]], [[United Airlines|United]], and [[American Airlines|American]], Canadian airline [[Air Canada]], [[Japan Airlines]], [[ANA (airline)|ANA]], [[Air New Zealand]], [[Qantas]], etc., demanding that they change travel destination cities in Taiwan in their websites to list them under "Taiwan, Province of China", or directly list them as, for example, "[[Taipei]], China" and "[[Kaohsiung]], China".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=JAMES PALMER, BETHANY ALLEN-EBRAHIMIAN  |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/27/china-threatens-u-s-airlines-over-taiwan-references-united-american-flight-beijing/ |title=China Threatens U.S. Airlines Over Taiwan References |publisher=Foreign Policy |date=27 April 2018 |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air Canada and other non-US airlines quickly complied. However, US Airlines requested a time extension to consider the issue, and replied to the China Civil Aviation Authority that they will confer with the U.S. government regarding the course of action. The White House responded by labeling the move as  "Orwellian nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=White House: China push on Taiwan is 'Orwellian nonsense' |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/white-house-china-push-on-taiwan-is-orwellian-nonsense/ |accessdate=19 July 2018 |work=The Seattle Times |date=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The China Civil Aviation Authority therefore extended the deadline for US airlines to July 25, 2018 for compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2152459/beijings-demand-refer-china-taiwan-still-being-defied |title=Beijing's demand to refer to 'China Taiwan' still being defied by US airlines |publisher=South China Morning Post |date=26 June 2018 |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline |date=August 2018 }}

'''''The Great Cat and Dog Massacre''''' is a non-fiction book written by [[Hilda Kean]]. It tells the story of  the September 1939 time period at the start of [[World War II]], when hundreds of thousands of [[United Kingdom|British]] family pets were preemptively [[euthanized]] in anticipation of air raids and resource shortages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-pets-war-on-hilda-keans-the-great-cat-and-dog-massacre/ "The Pets’ War: On Hilda Kean’s “The Great Cat and Dog Massacre”"].

''Daily Mail'',  John Preston, 4 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Kean also uses the episode to discuss people's feelings about their pets and the psychology of a population at war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/05/08/shattered-the-great-cat-and-dog-massacre-number-11-and-a-little-more-human "Briefly Noted"].

The book was published in 2017 by University of Chicago Press.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/books/review/great-cat-and-dog-massacre-hilda-kean.html "Keep Calm and Kiss the Cat Goodbye"]. ''New York Times'', Elena Passarello, April 21, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Its title is a reference to [[Robert Darnton]]'s 1984 work ''[[The Great Cat Massacre]]''.

'''''The Harafish''''' ({{lang-ar|الحرافيش}}) (in orig. Arabic ''Malhamat al-harafish'') is a novel written by [[Naguib Mahfouz]]. It comprises a series of episodes in a dozen generations of a family from the Egyptian urban rabble (the "harafish").  Many of the members of this family become clan chiefs in an alley in the city; some of them are benefactors to the other members of the harafish; some are more corrupt.  Neither the location within Egypt nor the time of the events is ever identified.

TCKs move between cultures before they have had the opportunity to fully develop their personal and cultural [[identity (social science)|identity]].&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = A.M. | last2 = Barker | first2 = G.G. | year = 2012 | title = Confused or multicultural: Third culture individuals' cultural identity | url = | journal = International Journal of Intercultural Relations | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 553–562 | doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2011.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first culture of such individuals refers to the culture of the country from which the parents originated, the second culture refers to the culture in which the family currently resides, and although not widely agreed upon by the TCK community, some sources refer to the third culture as the amalgamation of these two cultures.&lt;ref name="melles"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Melles | first1 = E.A. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = J. | year = 2013 | title = Does the third culture kid experience predict levels of prejudice? | url = | journal = International Journal of Intercultural Relations | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 260–267 | doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2012.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lyttle"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lyttle | first1 = A.D. | last2 = Barker | first2 = G.G. | last3 = Cornwell | first3 = T.L. | year = 2011 | title = Adept through adaptation: Third culture individuals' interpersonal sensitivity | url = | journal = International Journal of Intercultural Relations | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 686–694 | doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2011.02.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "useem"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Useem | first1 = J. | last2 = Useem | first2 = R. | last3 = Donoghue | first3 = J. | year = 1963 | title = Men in the middle of the third culture: The roles of American and non-western people in cross-cultural administration | url = | journal = Human Organization | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 169–179 | doi=10.17730/humo.22.3.5470n44338kk6733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, the number of [[Multilingualism|bilingual]] children in the world was about the same as the number of [[Monolingualism|monolingual]] children.&lt;ref&gt;Paradis, J., Genesee, F., &amp; Crago, M. (2011). ''Dual Language Development and Disorders: A handbook on bilingualism &amp; second language learning''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; TCKs are often exposed to a second (or third, fourth, etc.) language while living in their host culture, being physically exposed to the environment where the native language is used in practical aspects of life. "TCKs learn some languages in schools abroad and some in their homes or in the marketplaces of a foreign land. ... Some pick up languages from the nannies in the home or from playmates in the neighborhood" (Bell-Villada et al. 23). This [[language immersion]] is why TCKs are often bilingual, and sometimes even multilingual.&lt;ref name="pollock" /&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:National Multicultural Festival (6856303265).jpg|thumb|A banner from the National Multicultural Festival in Canberra, Australia]]
The term "third culture kid" was first coined by researchers John and [[Ruth Hill Useem|Ruth Useem]] in the 1950s, who used it to describe the children of American citizens working and living abroad.&lt;ref name="melles" /&gt; Ruth Useem first used the term after her second year-long visit to [[India]] with her fellow [[sociologist]]/[[anthropologist]] husband and three children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.asanet.org/footnotes/dec03/departments.html Ruth Useem's obituary in Footnotes, the Newsletter of the American Sociological Association], December 2003. Retrieved 2010-01-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Useem et al. (1963) depicted individuals who have undergone such an experience as having distinct standards of interpersonal behavior, work-related [[Norm (social)|norms]], codes of lifestyle and [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspectives]], and communication. This creates a new cultural group that does not fall into their home or host culture, but rather share a culture with all other TCKs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Useem | first1 = J. | last2 = Useem | first2 = R. | year = 1967 | title = The interfaces of a binational third culture: A study of the American community in India | url = | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 130–143 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1967.tb00567.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 she wrote:
{{Quote|text=In summarizing that which we had observed in our cross-cultural encounters, we began to use the term "third culture" as a generic term to cover the styles of life created, shared, and learned by persons who are in the process of relating their societies, or sections thereof, to each other. The term "Third Culture Kids" or TCKs was coined to refer to the children who accompany their parents into another society.|sign=Ruth Hill Useem|source=[http://www.tckworld.com/useem/art1.html TCK World: The Official Home of Third Culture Kids]}}

Kay Branaman Eakin, the former Education Counselor for the [[United States Department of State]], worked with American families returning to the United States after having lived abroad. She described a TCK as "someone who, as a child, has spent a significant period of time in one or more culture(s) other than [his/her] own, thus integrating elements of those cultures and their own birth culture, into a third culture."&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, K.B. (1998). According to my passport, I'm coming home. ''U.S. Department of State'', 18. Retrieved from http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/2065.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, K.B. Our consultants: Kay Branaman Eakin. ''Bennett Schoolplacment Worldwide.''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, author and researcher Norma McCaig used the term "[[global nomad]]", which is synonymous with TCK, but was used in order to take into account that the child's situation was as a result of a parent or parents' [[career]] or life choice(s).&lt;ref&gt;McCaig, N. (1994, September). Growing up with a world view. ''Foreign Service Journal'', 32–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General characteristics==
Third culture kids can also be referred to as cultural hybrids, cultural chameleons, and global nomads.&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt; TCKs are particularly adept at building relationships with other cultures while not possessing a [[cultural identity]] of their own.&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt; It has been discussed in the past that the characteristics that have been put forth by prominent researchers in the TCK field have only been discussed when referring to American children who have lived abroad. However, there has been further research done on TCKs that shows that the same characteristics described by Pollock and Useem in the most prominent TCK literature also apply to individuals from other nations who have also lived abroad for extended periods of time during their developmental years.&lt;ref name ="pollock"/&gt;&lt;ref name="useem"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "bonebright"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonebright | first1 = D.A. | year = 2010 | title = Adult third culture kids: HRD challenges and opportunities | url = | journal = Human Resources Development International | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 351–359 | doi=10.1080/13678861003746822}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are benefits and challenges to being a TCK according to various researchers on the subject.  The term TCKs may be applied to all social classes and although there are certain distinctions between TCKs and immigrants, it can include immigrant and refugee students (Dewaele 8c van Oudenhoven, 2009).&lt;ref name="Limberg, D. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Limberg | first1 = D. | last2 = Lambie | first2 = G. W. | year = 2011 | title = Third Culture Kids: Implications for Professional School Counseling | url = | journal = Professional School Counseling | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 45–54 | doi=10.5330/psc.n.2011-15.45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
*Expanded [[World view|worldview]]: TCKs have an understanding that there is more than one way to look at situations that they are exposed to or experience. This can also be a challenge however, when TCKs return to a culture that is [[homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogenous]] in their belief system, as an expanded worldview is perceived as offensive or useless.&lt;ref name="pollock" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lyttle" /&gt;
*Third-dimensional view of the world: With an increased number of hands-on [[experience]]s in multiple cultures, there is a difference in the way that the world is perceived. For example, there has been an increase in [[cross-cultural]] authors, such as [[Khaled Hosseini]], author of ''[[The Kite Runner]]'', who have received awards for their works that are written from a [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] perspective. These authors are able to provide vivid descriptions about the cultures they have directly experienced and thus their work appears to be "three-dimensional."&lt;ref name="pollock" /&gt;
*Interpersonal sensitivity: Increased exposure to a variety of perceptions and lifestyles allow TCKs to monitor their emotions, and register societal norms and cues more adeptly so as to produce higher [[sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]] to other cultures and ways of life.&lt;ref name="lyttle" /&gt;
*Cross-cultural competence or [[cultural intelligence]]: the capacity to function effectively across national, ethnic, and organizational cultures. 
*TCK have been found to have higher levels of general adjustment as opposed to mono cultural children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Selmer | first1 = J. | last2 = Lauring | first2 = J. | year = 2014 | title = Self-initiated expatriates: An exploratory study of adjustment of adult third-culture kids vs. Adult mono-culture kids | url = | journal = Cross Cultural Management | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 422–436 | doi = 10.1108/CCM-01-2013-0005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural adaptability is also a benefit, although may also come as a challenge which results from lack of cultural balance.&lt;ref name="Tokuhama-Espinosa"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2i0h2Oxh7EoC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=third+culture+kids#v=onepage&amp;q=third%20culture%20kids&amp;f=false|title=The Multilingual Mind: Issues Discussed By, For, and about People Living with Many Languages|last=Tokuhama-Espinosa|first=Tracey|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780897899185|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The major benefit, however, is related to language exposure. As pointed out by Tokuhama-Espinosa,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Multilingual Mind: Issues Discussed By, For and about People Living with Many Languages|last=Tokuhama-Espinisa|first=Tracy|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=2003|isbn=978-0897899192|location=Santa Barbara|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; language opens the doors to new realms including that of new cultures. TCKs, through prolonged exposure to native language use, can thus also learn to see themselves through the eyes of others.

===Challenges===
*Confused [[Loyalty|loyalties]]: Third culture kids can experience a lot confusion with politics and values. This is especially the case when moving from [[collectivism|collectivist]] to [[individualism|individualist]] cultures, or vice versa, as the values within each culture are different from the other.&lt;ref name="pollock" /&gt; This issue is also related with the [[identity crisis]], on a cultural level, not being able to feel a sense of oneness with any one nationality or culture. Oftentimes, TCKs cannot answer the question: "Where is home?"&lt;ref name="Tokuhama-Espinosa"/&gt;  
*Painful awareness of reality: difficulty adjusting to cultures where the only culture that is discussed or focused on is itself.&lt;ref name="pollock" /&gt;
*Ignorance of home culture: TCKs are often lacking in knowledge about their home nation, culture, town, and/or family. With current technology leading to the globalization of information, this is becoming increasingly less of a challenge provided the TCKs use modern technology in their host cultures to connect to their home culture. Understanding a culture’s sense of humor, however, is a commonly cited difficulty with the transition back to a home culture. There are also general societal norms and practices that will not be known when a TCK is first re-introduced to his/her home culture but those are eventually learned.&lt;ref name="pollock" /&gt;
*Difficulties with adjusting to adult life: the mixture of influences from the various cultures that the individual has lived can create challenges in developing an identity as well as with a sense of belonging. Feelings of rootlessness and restlessness can make the transition to [[emerging adulthood and early adulthood|adulthood]] a challenging period for TCKs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hervey | first1 = E | year = 2009 | title = Cultural transitions during childhood and adjustments to college | url = | journal = Journal of Psychology and Christianity | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 3–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"American ATCKs reported significantly higher levels of prejudice than non-American ATCKs on the Cognitive subscale of the QDI and the Social Dominance Orientation scale (SDO)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Melles | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = J. | year = 2013 | title = Does the third culture kid experience predict levels of prejudice? | url = | journal = International Journal of Intercultural Relations | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 260–267 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijintrel.2012.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*There is a need for special attention of young TCK in educational settings to make sure they are supported when and if entering a new school. This would allow for an optimal learning experience for the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = P. L. | year = 2013 | title = It's not all about academic achievement: supporting the social and emotional needs of migrant worker children | url = | journal = Pastoral Care in Education | volume = 31 | issue = 2| pages = 173–190 | doi = 10.1080/02643944.2012.747555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Walters and Auton-Cuff (2009) found that female TCKs hesitate to develop relationships and have less emotional affect as compared to non-TCKs. Furthermore, female TCKs' identity development was delayed because of their focus on adjusting rather than creating a sense of belonging (Walters &amp; Auton-Cuff, 2009)."&lt;ref name="Limberg, D. 2011"/&gt;

==Psychological effect==

===Identity===
One of the challenges of being a third culture kid during childhood is developing a sense of [[Belongingness|belonging]], commitment, and [[attachment theory|attachment]] to a culture. These factors play a strong role in one's [[self-esteem]] and [[Identity (psychology)|identity]], and are especially apparent as present or not present among TCKs.&lt;ref name="hoersting"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoersting | first1 = R.C. | year = 2010 | title = No place to call home: Cultural homelessness, self-esteem, and cross-cultural identities | url = https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc10991/| journal = International Journal of Intercultural Relations | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 17–30 | doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2010.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are psychological benefits to being a bi-culturally competent individual, meaning that adjustment to the host culture and [[repatriation]] do not pose a difficulty for the individual. Individuals who do not experience this same smooth transition into the new culture are referred to as "culturally rootless" and "cultural homelessness". Culturally homeless (CH) individuals often experience confusion over their identity and especially because the TCK is frequently abroad during the adolescent development years when identity is most solidified psychologically.&lt;ref name="hoersting"/&gt;

When individuals who have spent a significant number of their developmental years in a host culture and have not been able to adapt, develop an identity, and do not feel as though they belong, they are considered "culturally homeless". Cultural homelessness has been found to have both advantages and disadvantages, at times to being associated with low self-esteem, perceiving less control over one's own life, and an unsatisfactory level of experience with belonging and attachment.&lt;ref name="hoersting"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hoersting"/&gt;

===Authoritarianism===
TCKs have the unique experience of being exposed to and living in cultures different from their home culture for extended periods of time. Based on only one source, this has been found to affect their level of [[authoritarian personality|authoritarianism]], both positively and negatively depending on the circumstance of the TCK. Within the context of the methodology and subjects selected in the study, authoritarianism measurements were used by the researchers on individuals, and high scores on the [[right-wing authoritarianism|right-wing authoritarian]] scale (RWA) have been found to possess the following three personality characteristics: a tendency to submit themselves to [[authority]] figures, a willingness to commit an act of aggression for the sake of this authority or authorities, and possessing significant concern with acting according to the rules and norms of their group.&lt;ref name="peterson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peterson | first1 = B.E. | last2 = Plamondon | first2 = L.T. | year = 2009 | title = Third culture kids and the consequence of international sojourns on authoritarianism, acculturative balance, and positive affect | doi = 10.1016/j.jrp.2009.04.014 | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 755–763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Though research initially largely focused on children in missionary families or children of [[diplomat]]s, it has since expanded to other populations, including non-U.S. citizens. The researchers who pioneered the TCK research, such as Ruth Useem, were not expecting to find as many participants as they did. Useem and Cottrell, for example, were seeking at least 100 participants to respond to a survey that they believed to be "unconsciously long" but instead had 680 participants (ranging in age from 25–84 years) respond to the [[questionnaire]]. Instances like this one indicate to researchers the potential in exploring a subject matter that is still open to much research.&lt;ref name="bonebright"/&gt;

===Increased tolerance===
From the research that has been conducted on TCKs, it has been found that subjects are generally more [[tolerant]] of different cultures and of people of different backgrounds than subjects from the same home country who are not TCKs. In addition, TCKs generally feel that they are better able to adapt to new cultures and understand how to behave appropriately in these new environments.&lt;ref name="sheard"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheard | first1 = W | year = 2008 | title = Lessons from our kissing cousins: Third culture kids and gifted children | url = | journal = Roeper Review: A Journal on Gifted Education | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 31–38 | doi=10.1080/02783190701836437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher and teacher Wenda Sheard surveyed some of her multi-cultural students, most of whom were either [[fluency|fluent]] in two or more languages, and found that many felt that they had an increased tolerance of other cultures. However, as one student explained, part of this tolerance was out of necessity for maintaining a healthy social life in one's new environment and culture.&lt;ref name="sheard" /&gt;
 
In a study by Dewaele and van Oudenhoven (2009), it was found that TCKs scored higher on the open-mindedness scale on the Multicultural Personality Questionnaire (MPQ). According to the study, "this dimension [of the test] evaluates for open and unprejudiced attitudes toward out-group members, as well as diverse cultural norms and values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dewaele | first1 = J.M. | last2 = van Oudenhoven | first2 = P. | year = 2009 | title = The effect of multilingualism/multiculturalism on personality: no gain without pain for third culture kids? | url = | journal = International Journal of Multilingualism | volume = 6 | issue = 4| pages = 443–459 | doi=10.1080/14790710903039906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual effect===
Though the intellectual effect of being a TCK has not yet been widely explored, there has been some research in the area. One particular study by Lee and Bain (2007) that was found to have significant findings was conducted on young native [[Koreans]] who had recently moved to the United States and were attending school in America. The researchers were looking to see how these students would respond to explicit instruction aimed to work with their [[originality]] and [[fluency]] and that is specific to TCKs. This was measured through the level of [[creativity]] demonstrated in assigned tasks given to the students. TCKs were found to be able to demonstrate significantly higher levels of creativity and originality for [[problem solving]] than TCKs not given this same explicit instruction. This study has implications for the ways that TCKs can be instructed differently from the traditional [[curriculum]] to enhance their creativity and problem solving abilities because of their third culture experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = Y.J. | last2 = Bain | first2 = S.K. | last3 = McCallum | first3 = R.S. | year = 2007 | title = Improving creative problem-solving in a sample of third culture kids | url = | journal = School Psychology International | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 449–463 | doi = 10.1177/0143034307084135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual effect is also possible through differences in choosing to continue studies in [[higher education]] after high school. In 2001, it was found by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics|U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]] that 61.7 percent of 2001 high school graduates were enrolled in college. That same year, it was found that 95 percent of the TCK population were either enrolled or had some college education. Twenty-nine percent of this population had received an advanced degree, which is also higher than the percentage of the general population.&lt;ref name="bonebright"/&gt;

===Gender differences===
Much of the literature and research surrounding TCKs has found that these individuals are more open to learning new languages, demonstrate more flexibility when interacting with a novel culture than their monoculture peers, and a greater interest in continuing a global nomad lifestyle, which includes an interest in international careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gerner | first1 = M | year = 1993 | title = A profile of an American international school | url = | journal = Global Nomad Quarterly | volume = 2 | issue = 1| page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that women are more inclined to seek out [[interpersonal relationships]] while men are more task-oriented in their relationships and choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cann | first1 = A. | last2 = Siegfried | first2 = W. D. | year = 1990 | title = Gender stereotypes and dimensions of effective leader behavior | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 23 | issue = 7–8| pages = 413–419 | doi=10.1007/bf00289229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such findings were used in the hypothesis of a study conducted by Gerner &amp; Perry (2000) that predicted that [[gender role|gender differences]] would also be found in the cultural acceptance and experiences of TCKs.&lt;ref name="gerner"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gerner | first1 = M.E. | last2 = Perry | first2 = F. | year = 2000 | title = Gender differences in cultural acceptance and career orientation among internationally mobile and non-internationally mobile adolescents | url = | journal = School Psychology Review | volume = 29 | issue = | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both non-U.S. citizen females and U.S. citizen females were found to have more positive ratings of cultural acceptance, acquisition or exposure to a new language, travel, and interest in going into an international career in the future and were less prone to stereotypes.&lt;ref name="sheard" /&gt;

==Education and counseling==
With the growing number of international business, military placements, and immigration there has been a growing number of TCKs. Third culture kids are being educated in a culture that is not their own. Schools and teachers need to be aware of the culture differences these students face. Studies have found that educators and counselors should be culturally competent and possess the knowledge to properly educate these type of students. This would create an effective and optimal environment for their learning and adjusting abilities. Research conducted on TCKs have  been found to need special attention during their transition phase. The stress and grief students feel during transitional phases can distort their psycho-social development which can affect their grades and school work. Therefore, Third Culture Kid students need a comfortable and inviting school setting to offset the effect of their transition. The best way for counselors to work with TCKs is to have sound knowledge about the students and their unique characteristics.&lt;ref name="Limberg, D. 2011"/&gt;

===Emotions===
An empirical research was done by Katholiki Georgiades, Michael H. Boyle, and Kelly A. Fife over the Emotional and Behavior Problems Among Adolescent Students, in specific immigrant students. They examined the relationship between immigrants and racial/ethnic congruence in school. They hypothesized that school belonging is the connection between the congruency and the emotional problems. Although their study was unable to find enough evidence to support their hypothesis they agree that school belonging will influence emotional behavioral problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Georgiades | first1 = K. | last2 = Boyle | first2 = M. | last3 = Fife | first3 = K. | year = 2003 | title = Emotional and Behavioral Problems Among Adolescent Students: The Role of Immigrant, Racial/Ethnic Congruence and Belongingness in Schools | url = | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 42 | issue = 9| pages = 1473–1492 | pmid = 23192451 | doi=10.1007/s10964-012-9868-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to other studies, TCKs are proven to have less emotional stability than those who grew up in more culturally and socially stable environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/14790710903039906|pages=443–459|title=The effect of multilingualism/multiculturalism on personality: no gain without pain for Third Culture Kids?|journal=International Journal of Multilingualism|volume=6|issue=4|year = 2009|last1 = Dewaele|first1 = Jean-Marc|last2=Van Oudenhoven|first2=Jan Pieter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Careers that lead to third culture kids==

===Military===
TCKs who have parents or guardians affiliated with the military have varying levels of exposure to local culture. This is due to the possibility of living on base or off base. TCKs who live off base or who are not closely affiliated with the military (such as contractors) will have higher exposure and cultural shaping, while those who spend the majority of their time on the base will have lower exposure and minimal cultural shaping.&lt;ref name="Pearce2002" /&gt; Military children who are immersed in local culture from birth tend to show an extremely high level of cultural shaping, and upon relocation they are likely to cling to said culture for years, if not their lifetime. Relocation for these particular TCKs has shown to be particularly marring for them emotionally.&lt;ref name=Pearce2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Richard|title=Children's International Relocation and the Development Process, in 'Military Brats and Other Global Nomads', M. Ender, ed.|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood|location=Portland|isbn=978-0-275-97266-0|pages=157, 168–170|url=http://www.transition-dynamics.com/milbrats.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
See also [[Military brat (U.S. subculture)]].

===Non-military government===
Some of these TCKs may grow up moving from country to country in the diplomatic corps (see [[Foreign Service Brat]]) while others may live their lives near military bases.&lt;ref name = "sponsor" /&gt;

===Religious===
[[Missionary Kids]] (MKs) typically spend the most time overseas, of any TCKs, in one country. 85% of MKs spend more than 10 years in foreign countries and 72% lived in only one foreign country. Of all TCKs, MKs generally have the most interaction with the local populace and the least interaction with people from their passport country. They are also the most likely of the TCKs to integrate themselves into the local culture.&lt;ref name = "sponsor"&gt;Cotrell (2002) p 231{{Full citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  83% of missionary kids have at least one parent with an advanced degree.&lt;ref name=Cottrell2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Cottrell|first=Ann|title=Educational and Occupational Choices of American Adult Third Culture Kids, in 'Military Brats and Other Global Nomads', M. Ender, ed.|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-275-97266-0|url=http://www.transition-dynamics.com/milbrats.html|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Missionary kids struggle adjusting to the parents culture; the majority of MKs identify mostly with the country in which their parents served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bikos|first=L.H.|author2=Kocheleva, J. |author3=King, D. |author4=Chang, G.C. |author5=McKenzie, A. |author6=Roenicke, C. |author7=Eckard, K. |title=A consensual qualitative investigation into the repatriation experiences of young adult, missionary kids|journal=Mental Health, Religion &amp; Culture|year=2009|volume=7|issue=7|series=12|pages=735–754|doi=10.1080/13674670903032637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Preacher's kid|Priests' Kids (PKs) or Pastor's Kids]] are sometimes considered TCKs because they, like military brats, grow up moving from place to place regularly, but are sometimes excluded because they do not often grow up outside their passport country.

===Business===
Another career that can lead to TCKs is a career in business. Sixty-three percent of business TCKs have lived in foreign countries at least 10 years but are more likely than children in missionary families to live in multiple countries.  Business TCKs have fairly high interaction with both their host nationals and people from their host country.&lt;ref name = "sponsor" /&gt;

===Other===
Not all TCK families have one of the fours careers listed above. Other careers include working for an intergovernmental agency (for example, the [[Nuclear Energy Agency]], the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], and the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie#Intergovernmental agency|International Agency of the Francophonie]]), an international non-governmental organization (for example, an international school or serving as international staff of the United Nations or one of their agencies), and a local organization such as a [[hospital]]. Working in media and/or athletic industries (for example, [[Wally Szczerbiak]]) can also mean being moved abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2002) p 227.{{Full citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of the other careers that send employees abroad, involvement with the host culture can vary greatly.&lt;ref name = "sponsor" /&gt;

Recent research into the 'other' category has identified a subgroup of TCKs now labelled EdKids. These are children who relocate to various countries with their parents who are educators in the international schools.  This creates a unique paradigm of a nuclear family whose family-work-school-social experiences are intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;Zilber, E. (2009). Third Culture Kids: Children of International School Educators. London: John Catt Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career decisions==

===Effect on the workforce===
Third culture kids, with their international experience, generally value the international aspect of their lives. In a [[survey methodology|survey]] given to TCKs in 2001, there was a strong interest among TCK participants to continue to travel as they move into adulthood and their future careers, and many continued to maintain their internationally acquired languages. It was also found in these surveys that approximately half of the participants continue to travel at least once a year and that just a little under 15 percent travel for business.&lt;ref name="bonebright"/&gt; TCKs have also been found to report selecting to study majors while in college that could have the options of having international careers. Some of these fields of study include business, [[nursing]], and [[teaching English as a foreign language]].&lt;ref&gt;Cottrell, A.B. (2002).

==Language and third culture kids==
[[File:Languages world map.svg|thumb|A map of the world's major language families.]]
Most international TCKs are expected to speak English and some countries require their expatriate families to be proficient with the English language.&lt;ref name="Pearce2002"/&gt; This is largely because most international schools use the English language as the norm.&lt;ref name=Pearce2002 /&gt;

Families tend to seek out schools whose principal languages they share, and ideally one which mirrors their own educational system. Many countries have American schools, French schools, British schools, German Schools and 'International Schools' which often follow one of the three [[International Baccalaureate]] programs. These will be populated by [[expatriate]]s' children and some children of the local upper middle class. They do this in an effort to maintain linguistic stability and to ensure that their children do not fall behind due to linguistic problems. Where their own language is not available, families will often choose English-speaking schools for their children. They do this because of the linguistic and cultural opportunities being immersed in English might provide their children when they are adults, and because their children are more likely to have prior exposure to English than to other international languages. This poses the potential for non-English speaking TCKs to have a significantly different experience from TCKs for whom English is a native language.&lt;ref name=Hylmo&gt;{{cite book|last=Hylmö|first=Annika|title=Other Expatriate Adolescents: A Postmodern Approach to Understanding Expatriate Adolescents Among Non-U.S. Children, in 'Military Brats and Other Global Nomads', M. Ender, ed.|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood|location=Portland|isbn=978-0-275-97266-0|pages= 196, 201|url=http://www.transition-dynamics.com/milbrats.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on TCKs from Japan, Denmark, Italy, Germany, the United States and Africa has shown that TCKs from different countries share more in common with other TCKs than they do with their own peer group from their passport country.&lt;ref name=Hylmo /&gt;

A few sociologists studying TCKs, however, argue that the commonality found in international TCKs is not the result of true commonality, but rather the researcher's bias projecting expectations upon the studied subculture. They believe that some of the superficial attributes may mirror each other, but that TCKs from different countries are really different from one another.&lt;ref name=Hylmo /&gt; The exteriors may be the same, but that the understanding of the world around them differs.&lt;ref name=Pearce2002 /&gt;

===Kikokushijo===
In Japan, the use of the term "third culture kids" to refer to children returned from living overseas is not universally accepted; they are typically referred to both in Japanese and in English as ''[[kikokushijo]]'', literally "returnee children", a term which has different implications. Public awareness of ''kikokushijo'' is much more widespread in Japan than awareness of TCKs in the United States, and government reports as early as 1966 recognised the need for the school system to adapt to them. However, views of ''kikokushijo'' have not always been positive; in the 1970s, especially, they were characterised in media reports and even by their own parents as "educational orphans" in need of "rescue" to reduce their foreignness and successfully reintegrate them into Japanese society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kano Podolsky|first=Momo|title=Crosscultural upbringing: A comparison of the "third culture kids" framework and "Kaigai/Kikokushijo" studies|journal=Gendai Shakai Kenkyū|volume=6|pages=67–78|url=http://www.cs.kyoto-wu.ac.jp/bulletin/6/kanou.pdf|format=PDF|date=2004-01-31|accessdate=2007-11-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306105426/http://www.cs.kyoto-wu.ac.jp/bulletin/6/kanou.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;nCottrell, Ann Baker (2011).

==Statistics (U.S. TCKs)==
Research has been done on American TCKs to identify various characteristics:&lt;ref name=McCaig1994&gt;McCaig NM (1994). [https://web.archive.org/web/20010423103155/http://www.kaiku.com/nomads.html Growing up with a world view – nomad children develop multicultural skills]. ''Foreign Service Journal, pp. 32–41''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Useem2001&gt;Useem RH (2001). [http://www.iss.edu/pages/kids.html Third Culture Kids: Focus of Major Study] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041102091837/http://www.iss.edu/pages/kids.html |date=2004-11-02 }}. ''International Schools Services''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive and emotional development===
* Teenage TCKs are more mature than non-TCKs, but in their twenties take longer than their peers to focus their aims.&lt;ref name="Cottrell1993b"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cottrell | first1 = AB | last2 = Useem | first2 = RH | year = 1993 | title = TCKs Experience Prolonged Adolescence | url = http://www.tckworld.com/useem/art3.html | journal = International Schools Services | volume = 8 | issue = | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Depression is comparatively prevalent among TCKs.&lt;ref name="Cottrell1993b" /&gt;
* TCKs' sense of identity and well-being is directly and negatively affected by repatriation.&lt;ref name=Plamondon2008&gt;Plamondon, Laila (2008). Third Culture Kids: Factors that Predict Psychological Health after Repatriation. Honors Thesis, Smith College.&lt;/ref&gt; The severity of the effect from repatriation may also depend on the degree of cultural and linguistic differences between the TCK's place of recent residence and place of repatriation (e.g. relocating from London to Sydney vs London to Seoul for a Korean individual that spent most of his/her childhood away from Korea in a Western environment).  
* TCKs are highly linguistically adept (not as true for military TCKs).&lt;ref name=Cottrell1994&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cottrell | first1 = AB | last2 = Useem | first2 = RH | year = 1994 | title = ATCKs maintain global dimensions throughout their lives | url = http://www.tckworld.com/useem/art5.html | journal = International Schools Services | volume = 8 | issue = | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**A study whose subjects were all "career military brats"—those who had a parent in the military from birth through high school—shows that brats are linguistically adept.&lt;ref&gt;Ender, Morten, "Growing up in the Military" in Strangers at Home: Essays on the effects of living overseas and Coming 'home' to a strange land. Edited Carolyn Smith, Alethia Publications: New York. 1996. pp&amp;nbsp;88–90&lt;/ref&gt;
*Like all children, TCKs may experience [[stress (psychological)|stress]] and even [[grief]] from the [[Relocation (personal)|relocation]] experience.&lt;ref name="NITLC Brief Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tlcinst.org/Moving.html|title=Moving Can Become Traumatic|last=Sheppard|first=Caroline H.|author2=William Steele |year=2003|work=Trauma and Loss: Research and Interventions|publisher=Nat'l Inst for Trauma and Loss in Children|accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iowa State University paper by Lesia Oesterreich"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/PM1529G.pdf|title=Understanding children: moving to a new home|last=Oesterreich|first=Lesia|date=April 2004|publisher=Iowa State University|accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and career===
* TCKs are 4 times as likely as non-TCKs to earn a bachelor's degree (81% vs 21%)&lt;ref name=Cottrell1993a&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cottrell | first1 = AB | last2 = Useem | first2 = RH | year = 1993 | title = TCKs Four Times More Likely to Earn Bachelor's Degrees | url = http://www.tckworld.com/useem/art2.html | journal = International Schools Services | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 44 percent earned undergraduate degree after the age of 22.&lt;ref name="Cottrell1994" /&gt;
* Education, medicine, business management, self-employment, and highly skilled positions are the most common professions for TCKs.&lt;ref name="Cottrell1994" /&gt;

In Haitian folklore, '''Ti Malice''' is a [[trickster]] character, nemesis of '''Uncle Bouki''' or '''Tonton Bouqui'''. While Ti Malice is smart and guileful, Uncle Bouki while hardworking is also very greedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haiti Literature|url=http://www.teachingforchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Haiti_Literature.pdf|website=Teaching for Change|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the apt manipulation of this greed that allows Ti Malice to often best Uncle Bouki. These characters are said to be a split of [[Anansi]], the trickster character of the Ashanti of Ghana.
