'''Allison Jane Doupe''' (1954–24 October 2014) was an influential Canadian psychiatrist, biologist, and neuroscientist. She is best known for her pioneering work in [[bird|avian]] [[neurobiology]] that linked birdsong to human language, showing that birds and humans learn to communicate in similar ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Insel |first1 = TR |last2 = Landis |first2 = S |title = Allison Doupe (1954-2014) |journal = Nature |year = 2014 |volume = 515 |issue = 7527 |page = 344 |doi = 10.1038/515344a |pmid=25409820}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Doupe was awarded the [[Pradel Research Award]] by the [[National Academy of Sciences]] for her work on [[Neural circuit|neural circuits]] and information processing in [[song birds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/about-nas/awards/pradel-research-award.html |title=Pradel Research  Award |publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]] |accessdate=March 11, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102150453/http://www.nasonline.org/about-nas/awards/pradel-research-award.html |archivedate=January 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
After graduating from [[McGill University]], Doupe obtained her MD and PhD in Neurobiology from [[Harvard University]]. She joined the [[University of California, San Francisco]] Departments of Psychiatry and Physiology in 1993 as an assistant professor, and was promoted to full professor in 2000.&lt;ref name="InMemoriam"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://psych.ucsf.edu/doupe/| title = In Memoriam: Allison Doupe, MD, PhD| last =| first =| date = October 27, 2014 | publisher  = University of California, San Francisco Department of Psychiatry | accessdate = January 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barondes|first=Samuel|last2=Stryker|first2=Michael P.|date=February 2015|title=Allison Doupe: In Memoriam|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2015.01.030|journal=Neuron|volume=85|issue=4|pages=667–668|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2015.01.030|issn=0896-6273}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2008 she was elected as a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2008/04/8061/four-elected-american-academy-arts-sciences|title=Four Elected to American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences|website=UC San Francisco|language=en|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer''''' is a [[biography]] of [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] by [[Kai Bird]] and [[Martin J. Sherwin]] published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]] in 2005. Twenty-five years in the making, the book was awarded the 2006 [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography]]. It also won the 2008 [[Duff Cooper Prize]], Chicago Tribune Best Book of the Year, and ''[[Discover Magazine]]'' Best Science Book of the Year.

The book's title refers to the legend of [[Prometheus]], as mentioned in ''[[Scientific Monthly]]'' in September 1945:

{{quote|Modern Prometheans have raided Mount Olympus again and have brought back for man the very thunderbolts of Zeus.}}

It is 721 pages from start to finish in the May 2006 paperback edition, but it also includes 32 pages of photographs.

The first edition however, also has 721 pages.

'''Artemis Corona''' is a [[Corona (planetary geology)|corona]] found in the [[Aphrodite Terra]] continent, on the planet [[Venus]], at {{Coord|35|S|135|E|globe:Venus}}.

Named after [[Artemis]], the virgin goddess of hunting, it is the largest corona on Venus, with a diameter of 2,600 kilometers.  It is largely enclosed by the near circular [[Artemis Chasma]] - a circular belt of arc-shaped features believed to be largely of compressional origin.

Artemis is an unusual feature on Venus as it has been interpreted to be the site of plate tectonics operating on a regional scale.&lt;ref name=GSA&gt;Spencer, J. E. (2001) ''Possible giant metamorphic core complex at the center of Artemis Corona, Venus,'' Geological Society of America Bulletin 113(3), 333-345.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are grabens and compressional arcs which rise above the surrounding plains.  As a whole, Artemis is not elevated like other coronae.  Regions within Artemis are in fact some 4&amp;nbsp;km below the surrounding plains.  The differences between the highest and the lowest point within Artemis are in the order of 7.5&amp;nbsp;km.

The central rift region of Artemis has been interpreted as a spreading zone (Britomartis Chasma) which has been offset - with clear signs of strike-slip faulting offsetting the central rift zone.  Retrograde subduction is interpreted to occur at the circular arc belts of Artemis Chasmata.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

'''Blade element theory''' ('''BET''') is a mathematical process originally designed by  [[William Froude]] (1878), [[David W. Taylor]] (1893) and [[Stefan Drzewiecki]] to determine the behavior of [[propeller]]s. It involves breaking a blade down into several small parts then determining the forces on each of these small blade elements. These forces are then integrated along the entire blade and over one rotor revolution in order to obtain the forces and moments produced by the entire propeller or rotor. One of the key difficulties lies in modelling the induced velocity on the rotor disk. Because of this the blade element theory is often combined with the momentum theory to provide additional relationships necessary to describe the induced velocity on the rotor disk (for further details see [[Blade Element Momentum Theory]]). At the most basic level of approximation a uniform induced velocity on the disk is assumed:
:&lt;math&gt;v_i = \sqrt{\frac{T}{A} \cdot \frac{1}{2 \rho}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively the variation of the induced velocity along the radius can be modeled by breaking the blade down into small annuli and applying the conservation of mass, momentum and energy to every annulus. This approach is sometimes called the Froude-Finsterwalder equation.

If the blade element method is applied to helicopter rotors in forward flight it is necessary to consider the flapping motion of the blades as well as the longitudinal and lateral distribution of the induced velocity on the rotor disk. The most simple forward flight inflow models are first harmonic models.

{{Revolution sidebar}}
'''Class conflict''', frequently referred to as '''class warfare''' or '''class struggle''', is the tension or antagonism which exists in [[society]] due to competing [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] interests and desires between people of different [[Social class|classes]]. The view that the class struggle provides the lever for radical social change for the majority is central to the work of  [[Karl Marx]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].

Class conflict can take many different forms: direct violence, such as wars fought for resources and cheap labor; indirect violence, such as deaths from poverty, starvation, illness or unsafe working conditions; coercion, such as the threat of losing a job or the pulling of an important investment; or ideologically, such as with books and articles. Additionally, political forms of class conflict exist; legally or illegally lobbying or bribing government leaders for passage of desirable partisan legislation including labor laws, tax codes, consumer laws, acts of congress or other sanction, injunction or tariff. The conflict can be direct, as with a [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]] aimed at destroying a [[trade union|labor union]], or indirect, as with an informal slowdown in production protesting low wages by workers or [[unfair labor practice]]s by capital.

In the past the term ''Class conflict'' was a term used mostly by [[socialism|socialists]] and [[Marxism|Marxists]], who define a class by its relationship to the [[means of production]]—such as factories, land and machinery. From this point of view, the social control of production and labor is a contest between classes, and the division of these resources necessarily involves conflict and inflicts harm. It can involve ongoing low-level clashes, escalate into massive confrontations, and in some cases, lead to the overall defeat of one of the contending classes.  However, in more contemporary times this term is striking chords and finding new definition amongst capitalistic societies in the [[United States]] and other Westernized countries.

The anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] argued that the class struggle of the working class, peasantry and poor had the potential to lead to a social revolution involving the overthrow of ruling elites, and the creation of [[libertarian socialism]]. This was only a potential, and class struggle was, he argued, not always the only or decisive factor in society, but it was central. By contrast, [[Marx's theory of history|Marxists argue]] that [[historical materialism|class conflict always plays the decisive and pivotal role in the history of class-based hierarchical systems]] such as [[capitalism]] and [[feudalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Communist Manifesto]] |last=Marx |first=Karl |display-authors=etal |authorlink=Karl Marx |year=1848 |publisher=www.marxists.org |location=[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm]  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxists refer to its overt manifestations as class war, a struggle whose resolution in favor of the [[working class]] is viewed by them as inevitable under plutocratic [[capitalism]].

=== Pre-capitalist societies ===

Where societies are socially divided based on status, wealth, or control of social production and distribution, class structures arise and are thus coeval with civilization itself. It is well documented since at least European Classical Antiquity ([[Conflict of the Orders]], [[Spartacus]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World]]'' G.E.M. DE Ste. Croix Cornell University Press 1981 {{ISBN|0-8014-9597-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Popular revolt in late medieval Europe|the various popular uprisings in late medieval Europe]] and elsewhere.

One of the earliest analysis of these conflicts is [[Friedrich Engels]]' [[The Peasant War in Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Engels, The Peasant War in Germany, marxists.org&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest analyses of the development of class as the development of conflicts between emergent classes is available in [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution|Mutual Aid]]''. In this work, Kropotkin analyzes the disposal of goods after death in pre-class or [[hunter-gatherer]] societies, and how inheritance produces early class divisions and conflict.

Historian Steve Fraser, author of ''The Age of Acquiescence: The Life and Death of American Resistance to Organized Wealth and Power'', asserts that class conflict is an inevitability if current political and economic conditions continue, noting that “people are increasingly fed up… their voices are not being heard. And I think that can only go on for so long without there being more and more outbreaks of what used to be called class struggle, class warfare.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://billmoyers.com/episode/steve-fraser-new-robber-barons/ Full Show: The New Robber Barons] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20141223054003/http://billmoyers.com/episode/steve-fraser-new-robber-barons/ |date=2014-12-23 }}.

== Capitalist societies ==

The typical example of class conflict described is class conflict within capitalism.  This class conflict is seen to occur primarily between the [[bourgeoisie]] and the [[proletariat]], and takes the form of conflict over hours of work, value of wages, division of profits, cost of consumer goods, the culture at work, control over [[parliament]] or [[bureaucracy]], and [[economic inequality]].  The particular implementation of government programs which may seem purely humanitarian, such as disaster relief, can actually be a form of class conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Palast, Burn baby burn {{cite web |url=http://www.gregpalast.com/burn-baby-burnthe-california-celebrity-fires/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230023754/http://www.gregpalast.com/burn-baby-burnthe-california-celebrity-fires/ |archivedate=2007-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA class conflict is often noted in labor/management disputes. As far back as 1933 representative Edward Hamilton of ALPA, the [[Air Line Pilots Association, International|Airline Pilot's Association]], used the term "class warfare" to describe airline management's opposition at the National Labor Board hearings in October of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaps|first=Robert W.|title=Air Transport Labor Relations|year=1997|publisher=Southern Illinois Press|location=Section 3: Major Collective Bargaining Legislation|isbn=0-8093-1776-1|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from these day-to-day forms of class conflict, during periods of crisis or revolution class conflict takes on a violent nature and involves repression, assault, restriction of civil liberties, and murderous violence such as assassinations or death squads.

=== Thomas Jefferson, United States ===

Although [[Thomas Jefferson]] (1743–1826) led the United States as president from 1801–1809 and is considered one of the founding fathers, he died with immense amounts of debt. Regarding the interaction between social classes, he wrote,
{{Quote|text=I am convinced that those societies (as the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]]) which live without government enjoy in their general mass an infinitely greater degree of happiness than those who live under the European governments. Among the former, public opinion is in the place of law, &amp; restrains morals as powerfully as laws ever did anywhere. Among the latter, under pretence of governing they have divided their nations into two classes, wolves &amp; sheep. I do not exaggerate. This is a true picture of Europe. Cherish therefore the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. Do not be too severe upon their errors, but reclaim them by enlightening them. If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, you &amp; I, &amp; Congress &amp; Assemblies, judges &amp; governors shall all become wolves. It seems to be the law of our general nature, in spite of individual exceptions; and experience declares that man is the only animal which devours his own kind, for I can apply no milder term to the governments of Europe, and to the general prey of the rich on the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jefferson|first=Thomas|title=Letter to Edward Carrington - January 16, 1787|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Letter_to_Edward_Carrington_-_January_16,_1787|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116033458/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Letter_to_Edward_Carrington_-_January_16,_1787|archivedate=January 16, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=[[Thomas Jefferson]]|source=''Letter to Edward Carrington - January 16, 1787''}}

[[File:Noam Chomsky, 2004.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Noam Chomsky]], 2004]]

[[Noam Chomsky]], American [[Linguistics|linguist]], [[Philosophy|philosopher]], and [[political activist]] has criticized class war in the United States:
{{quote|Well, there’s always a class war going on. The United States, to an unusual extent, is a business-run society, more so than others. The business classes are very class-conscious—they’re constantly fighting a bitter class war to improve their power and diminish opposition. Occasionally this is recognized...

=== Max Weber, Germany ===

[[Max Weber]] (1864–1920) agrees with the fundamental ideas of Karl Marx about the economy causing class conflict, but claims that class conflict can also stem from prestige and power.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; Weber argues that classes come from the different property locations. Different locations can largely affect one's class by their education and the people they associate with.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; He also states that prestige results in different status groupings. This prestige is based upon the social status of one's parents. Prestige is an attributed value and many times cannot be changed. Weber states that power differences led to the formation of [[political parties]].&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; Weber disagrees with Marx about the formation of classes. While Marx believes that groups are similar due to their economic status, Weber argues that classes are largely formed by [[social status]].&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; Weber does not believe that communities are formed by economic standing, but by similar social prestige.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; Weber does recognize that there is a relationship between social status, social prestige and classes.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt;

=== Arab Spring ===
Numerous factors have culminated in what's known as the [[Arab Spring]]. Agenda behind the civil unrest, and the ultimate overthrow of authoritarian governments throughout the [[Middle-East]] included issues such as dictatorship or [[absolute monarchy]], [[human rights]] violations, [[government corruption]] (demonstrated by [[United States diplomatic cables leak|Wikileaks diplomatic cables]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/cockburn02182011.html |title=The Tweet and Revolution |first=Alexander |last=Cockburn |date=18–20 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227191052/http://www.counterpunch.org/cockburn02182011.html |archivedate=2011-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; economic decline, unemployment, extreme poverty, and a number of demographic structural factors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Korotayev]] A, Zinkina J |url=https://www.academia.edu/29300010/Egyptian_Revolution_A_Demographic_Structural_Analysis |title=Egyptian Revolution: A Demographic Structural Analysis |journal=Entelequia.

=== Marxist perspectives ===
[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Karl Marx, 1875]]

[[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) was a German born philosopher who lived the majority of his adult life in London, England. In ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', Karl Marx  argued that a [[Social class|class]] is formed when its members achieve [[class consciousness]] and solidarity.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"&gt;Blackwell Reference Online.''[http://www.blackwellreference.com./subscriber/uid=834/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_chunk_g97814051243319_ss1-50]''. Retrieved November 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This largely happens when the members of a class become aware of their [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] and the conflict with another class. A class will then realize their shared interests and a common identity. According to Marx, a class will then take action against those that are exploiting the lower classes.

What Marx points out is that members of each of the two main classes have interests in common. These class or collective interests are in conflict with those of the other class as a whole. This in turn leads to conflict between individual members of different classes.

Marxist analysis of society identifies two main social groups: 
* ''Labour'' (the [[proletariat]] or workers) includes anyone who earns their livelihood by selling their [[labor power]] and being paid a wage or salary for their labor time. They have little choice but to work for capital, since they typically have no independent way to survive.
* ''Capital'' (the [[bourgeoisie]] or capitalists) includes anyone who gets their income not from labor as much as from the [[surplus value]] they appropriate from the workers who create wealth. The income of the capitalists, therefore, is based on their [[Exploitation (Marxism)|exploitation]] of the workers (proletariat).

Not all class struggle is violent or necessarily radical, as with strikes and lockouts. Class antagonism may instead be expressed as low worker morale, minor sabotage and pilferage, and individual workers' abuse of petty authority and hoarding of information. It may also be expressed on a larger scale by support for socialist or populist parties. On the employers' side, the use of union busting legal firms and the lobbying for anti-union laws are forms of class struggle.

Not all class struggle is a threat to capitalism, or even to the authority of an individual capitalist. A narrow struggle for higher wages by a small sector of the working-class, what is often called "economism", hardly threatens the status quo. In fact, by applying the craft-union tactics of excluding other workers from skilled trades, an economistic struggle may even weaken the working class as a whole by dividing it. Class struggle becomes more important in the historical process as it becomes more general, as industries are organized rather than crafts, as workers' class consciousness rises, and as they self-organize away from political parties. Marx referred to this as the progress of the proletariat from being a class "in itself", a position in the social structure, to being one "for itself",an active and conscious force that could change the world.

Marx largely focuses on the capital industrialist society as the source of [[social stratification]], which ultimately results in class conflict.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; He states that capitalism creates a division between classes which can largely be seen in manufacturing factories. The proletariat, is separated from the bourgeoisie because production becomes a social enterprise. Contributing to their separation is the technology that is in factories. Technology de-skills and alienates workers as they are no longer viewed as having a specialized skill.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; Another effect of technology is a homogenous [[workforce]] that can be easily replaceable. Marx believed that this class conflict would result in the overthrow of the bourgeoisie and that the private property would be communally owned.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; The mode of [[Production (economics)|production]] would remain, but communal ownership would eliminate class conflict.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt;

Even after a revolution, the two classes would struggle, but eventually the struggle would recede and the classes dissolve. As class boundaries broke down, the state apparatus would wither away. According to Marx, the main task of any state apparatus is to uphold the power of the ruling class; but without any classes there would be no need for a state. That would lead to the classless, stateless communist society.

=== The Soviet Union and similar societies ===
A variety of predominantly [[trotskyist]] and [[anarchist]] thinkers argue that class conflict existed in [[Soviet Union|Soviet-style societies]].  Their arguments describe as a class the bureaucratic [[stratum]] formed by the ruling [[political party]] (known as the [[Nomenklatura]] in the Soviet Union)—sometimes termed a "[[new class]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Milovan | last = Đilas | authorlink = Milovan Đilas | year = 1983, 1957 | title = The New Class: An Analysis of the Communist System | edition = paperback | publisher = Harcourt Brace Jovanovich | location = San Diego | isbn = 0-15-665489-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;—that controls and guides the means of production. This ruling class is viewed to be in opposition to the remainder of society, generally considered the [[proletariat]].  This type of system is referred by them as [[state socialism]], [[state capitalism]], [[bureaucratic collectivism]] or [[new class]] societies. (Cliff; Ðilas 1957) Marxism was such a predominate ideological power in what became the Soviet Union since a Marxist group known as the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] was formed in the country, prior to 1917. This party soon divided into two main factions; the Bolsheviks, who were led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], and the [[Mensheviks]], who were led by [[Julius Martov]].

However many Marxist argue that unlike in Capitalism, the Soviet elites didn't own the [[Means of production]], or generated [[surplus value]] for their personal wealth like in capitalism, as the generated profit from the economy was equally distributed into Soviet society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harpal|first1=Brar|title=Trotskyism or Leninism?|date= October 1993|location=London|isbn=1874613036|pages=647}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even some trotskyist like [[Ernest Mandel]] criticized the concept of a new ruling class as an [[oxymoron]]. He said: "The hypothesis of the bureaucracy’s being a new ruling class leads to the conclusion that, for the first time in history, we are confronted with a “ruling class” which does not exist as a class before it actually rules."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ernest|first1=Mandel|title=Why The Soviet Bureaucracy is not a New Ruling Class (1979)|url=https://www.ernestmandel.org/en/works/txt/1979/soviet_bureaucracy.htm|accessdate=26 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522081826/http://www.ernestmandel.org/en/works/txt/1979/soviet_bureaucracy.htm|archivedate=22 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-Marxist perspectives ===
{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}

Social commentators, historians and socialist theorists had commented on class struggle for some time before Marx, as well as the connection between class struggle, property, and law: [[Augustin Thierry]],&lt;ref&gt;Augustin Thierry: [https://books.google.com/books?id=c5A1lIZb5H8C&amp;dq=Histoire+du+Tiers+%C3%89tat&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Recueil des monuments inédits de l'histoire du Tiers état] {{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[François Guizot]], [[François-Auguste Mignet]] and [[Adolphe Thiers]]. The [[Physiocrat]]s, [[David Ricardo]], and after Marx, [[Henry George]] noted the inelastic supply of land and argued that this created certain privileges ([[economic rent]]) for landowners. According to the historian [[Arnold Toynbee]], stratification along lines of class appears only within civilizations, and furthermore only appears during the process of a civilization's decline while not characterizing the growth phase of a civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Toynbee|first=Arnold|title=A Study of History: Abridgment of Volumes I - VI|year=1947|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-19-505081-9|editor=Dorothea Grace Somervell|page=365|chapter=The Nature of Disintegration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proudhon, in ''[[What is Property?]]'' (1840) states that "certain classes do not relish investigation into the pretended titles to property, and its fabulous and perhaps scandalous history."&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Proudhon, ''What is Property?'', chapter 2, remark 2.&lt;/ref&gt; While Proudhon saw the solution as the lower classes forming an alternative, solidarity economy centered on cooperatives and self-managed workplaces, which would slowly undermine and replace capitalist class society, the anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]], while influenced by Proudhon, insisted that a massive class struggle by the working class, peasantry and poor was essential to the creation of [[libertarian socialism]]. This would require a (final) showdown in the form of a social revolution.

[[Fascists]] have often opposed class struggle and instead have attempted to appeal to the working class while promising to preserve the existing social classes and have proposed an alternative concept known as [[class collaboration]].

Some historical tendencies of Orthodox Marxism [[No War but the Class War|reject]] racism, sexism, etc. as struggles that essentially [[false consciousness|distract]] from class struggle, the real conflict.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} These divisions within the class prevent the purported antagonists from acting in their common class interest. However, many Marxist internationalists and anti-colonial revolutionaries understand [https://libcom.org/library/sex-race-class-james-selma sex, race and class] to be bound up together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-06|title=Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Organization_of_Solidarity_with_the_People_of_Asia,_Africa_and_Latin_America&amp;oldid=829056713|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an ongoing debate within Marxist scholarship about these topics.

According to [[Michel Foucault]], in the 19th century the [[essentialist]] notion of the "[[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]" was incorporated by [[racism|racists]], [[biologists]], and [[eugenicists]], who gave it the modern sense of "biological race" which was then integrated to "[[state racism]]". On the other hand, Foucault claims that when [[Marxists]] developed their concept of "class struggle", they were partly inspired by the older, non-biological notions of the "race" and the "race struggle". In a letter to Friedrich Engels in 1882 Karl Marx wrote: ''You know very well where we found our idea of class struggle; we found it in the work of the French historians who talked about the race struggle.''&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Society Must be Defended'' by Michel Foucault (trans. [[David Macey]]), London: Allen Lane, Penguin Press (1976, 2003), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|reason=original source not listed|date=October 2016}}For Foucault, the theme of social war provides the overriding principle that connects class and race struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Laura Stoler, ''Race and the Education of Desire: Foucault's "History of Sexuality" and the Colonial Order of Things '', Duke University Press (1995), p.71-72&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moses Hess]], an important theoretician and [[Labor Zionism|labor zionist]] of the early socialist movement, in his "Epilogue" to "[[Rome and Jerusalem]]" argued that "the race struggle is primary, the class struggle secondary... With the cessation of race [[antagonism (philosophy)|antagonism]], the class struggle will also come to a standstill. The equalization of all classes of society will necessarily follow the [[emancipation]] of all the races, for it will ultimately become a scientific question of social economics."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in ''Prophecy and Politics: Socialism, Nationalism, and the Russian Jews'' by [[Jonathan Frankel]], Cambridge University Press (1981), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. E. B. Du Bois]] theorized that the [[intersectional]] paradigms of race, class, and nation might explain certain aspects of black political economy. [[ Patricia Hill Collins]] writes: "Du Bois saw race, class, and nation not primarily as personal identity categories but as social hierarchies that shaped African-American access to status, poverty, and power."&lt;ref name="Collins 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Collins | first = Patricia Hill | author-link = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Gender, black feminism, and black political economy | journal = [[Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]] | volume = 568 | issue = 1 | pages = 41–53 | doi = 10.1177/000271620056800105 | date = March 2000 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}}

[[File:Cox timepiece winding switch.png|thumb|Cox timepiece winding switch]]

'''Cox's timepiece''' is a [[clock]] developed in the 1760s by [[James Cox (inventor)|James Cox]]. It was developed in collaboration with [[John Joseph Merlin]] (with whom Cox also worked on developing [[automata]]). Cox claimed that his design was a true [[perpetual motion machine]], but as the device is powered from changes in [[atmospheric pressure]] via a [[mercury (element)|mercury]] [[barometer]], this is not the case.  The clock still exists today but was deactivated at the time of the clock's relocation to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ord-Hume | first = Arthur W. J. G. | year = 1977 | title = Perpetual Motion: The History of an Obsession | publisher = St. Martin's Press | location = New York | isbn = 0-312-60131-X}}, p. 118 ({{Google books|022yYXnS_GQC|online copy|page=118}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and history==
The clock is similar to other mechanical clocks, except that it [[Automatic watch|does not need winding]]. The change of pressure in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] acts as an external energy source and causes sufficient movement of the winding mechanism. This keeps the [[mainspring]] coiled inside the barrel. The clock is designed to enable the timepiece to run indefinitely and overwinding is prevented by a safety mechanism. The [[Wiktionary:prime mover|prime mover]], encased in a finely detailed clock body, is a [[Fortin mercury barometer]]. The barometer contained 68 [[kilogram]]s (150 [[pound (mass)|pound]]s) of mercury (approximately 5 litres).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bruton | first = Eric | year = 1979 | title = The History of Clocks and Watches | publisher = Rizzoli International Publications | location = New York | isbn = 0-8478-0261-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to this is [[Cornelis Drebbel]]'s device of 1610 (though it is unknown whether Cox knew of it).  It was a machine that told the time, date, and season. The gold machine was mounted in a globe on pillars and was powered by changes in air pressure (a sealed glass tub with liquid varied in volume through atmospheric pressure changes, rewinding constantly). 

The [[Atmos clock|Atmos]], manufactured by [[Jaeger LeCoultre]] is a modern clock which is similar to Cox's clock although the main driving force is generated from temperature differential, instead of pressure differential.

'''Dianetics''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''dia'', meaning "through", and ''nous'', meaning "[[mind]]") is a set of ideas and practices regarding the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] relationship between the mind and body created by science fiction writer [[L. Ron Hubbard]]. Dianetics is practiced by followers of [[Scientology]],&lt;ref name=Scientology&gt;{{cite news|title=The Mothership of All Alliances|first=Eliza|last=Gray|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/magazine/108205/scientology-joins-forces-with-nation-of-islam|newspaper=[[The New Republic]]|date=October 5, 2012|accessdate=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scientology1&gt;{{cite news|title=Louis Farrakhan renews call for self-determination among Nation of Islam followers|first1=Shelley|last1=Rossetter|first2=Thomas C.|last2=Tobin|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/religion/louis-farrakhan-renews-call-for-self-determination-among-nation-of-islam/1128781|newspaper=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|date=October 18, 2012|accessdate=November 19, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105093720/http://www.tampabay.com/news/religion/louis-farrakhan-renews-call-for-self-determination-among-nation-of-islam/1128781|archivedate=November 5, 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Nation of Islam]] (as of 2010),&lt;ref name=Auditing&gt;{{cite web|title=Nation of Islam Auditors graduation held for third Saviours' Day in a row|first=Asahed|last=Mohammed|url=http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/National_News_2/article_9651.shtml|publisher=Final Call|date=February 28, 2013|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and independent Dianeticist groups.

Dianetics divides the mind into three parts: the conscious "analytical mind", the subconscious "[[reactive mind]]", and the [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] mind.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Religious Freedom, Catharine Cookson, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003, {{ISBN|0-415-94181-4}}.(page 430/431)&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of Dianetics is to erase the content of the "reactive mind", which [[Scientologists]] believe interferes with a person's ethics, awareness, happiness, and sanity. The Dianetics procedure to achieve this erasure is called "[[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]]".&lt;ref&gt;Philosophers and Religious Leaders: An Encyclopedia of People Who Changed the World, Christian D. Von Dehsen &amp; Scott L. Harris, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, {{ISBN|1-57356-152-5}}.

Practitioners of Dianetics believe that "the basic principle of existence is to survive"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Hidden Story of Scientology|last = Garrison|first = Omar V.|publisher = Citadel Press, Lyle Stuart, Inc.|year = 1974|isbn = 0-8065-0440-4|location = Secaucus, NJ|pages = 23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the basic personality of humans is sincere, intelligent, and good.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The drive for goodness and survival is distorted and inhibited by aberrations&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; "ranging from simple neuroses to different psychotic states to various kinds of sociopathic behavior patterns."

When Hubbard formulated Dianetics, he described it as "a mix of Western technology and Oriental philosophy".&lt;ref name="James R.

I.|title=Dianetics : From Science-fiction to Fiction-science|journal=ETC: A Review of General Semantics|year=1951|volume=8:4|pages=280–293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard claimed that Dianetics could increase intelligence, eliminate unwanted emotions and alleviate a wide range of illnesses he believed to be [[psychosomatic]]. Among the conditions purportedly treated were arthritis, allergies, asthma, some coronary difficulties, eye trouble, ulcers, migraine headaches, "sexual deviation" (which for Hubbard included [[homosexuality]]), and even death.&lt;ref name=TwoMinds&gt;{{cite news | title = Of Two Minds | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,812852,00.html |work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] |date=July 24, 1950 |accessdate=July 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard asserted that "memories of painful physical and emotional experiences accumulate in a specific region of the mind, causing illness and mental problems." He taught that "once these experiences have been purged through cathartic procedures he developed, a person can achieve superior health and intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Joel | last = Sappell |author2=Robert W.

Dianetics predates Hubbard's classification of Scientology as an "applied religious philosophy". Early in 1951, he expanded his writings to include teachings related to the soul, or "[[thetan]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Hidden Story of Scientology|last = Garrison|first = Omar V.|publisher = Citadel Press, Lyle Stuart, Inc.|year = 1974|isbn = 0-8065-0440-4|location = Secaucus, NJ|pages = 34, 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dianetics is practiced by several independent Dianetics-only groups not connected with Scientology,{{clarify|date=September 2013}} and also [[Free Zone (Scientology)|Free Zone]] or Independent Scientologists.

==History==
{{Main|History of Dianetics}}
L. Ron Hubbard published Dianetics on May 9, 1950, as a "branch of self-help psychology".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/l-ron-hubbard-publishes-dianetics&lt;/ref&gt; In Dianetics, Hubbard introduced the "phenomena known as 'engrams'" as the source of "all psychological pain, which in turn harmed mental and physical health." He also claimed that individuals could reach the state of "clear", or a state of "exquisite clarity and mental liberation, by exorcising their engrams to an 'auditor,' or listener acting as therapist."
While not accepted by the medical and scientific establishment, in the first two years of its publication, over 100,000 copies of the book were sold. Many enthusiasts emerged to form groups to study and practice Dianetics. The atmosphere from which Dianetics was written about in this period was one of "excited experimentation". Roy Wallis writes that Hubbard's work was regarded as an "initial exploration" for further development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=SCIENTOLOGY: THERAPEUTIC CULT TO RELIGIOUS SECT |journal=Sociology |year=1975 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=89–100 |jstor=42851574|doi=10.1177/003803857500900105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard wrote an additional six books in 1951, drawing the attention of a significant fan base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/l-ron-hubbard-publishes-dianetics|title=L. Ron Hubbard publishes Dianetics|date=May 9, 1950|accessdate=2016-08-25|website= HISTORY.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prepublication ===
Hubbard always claimed that his ideas of Dianetics originated in the 1920s and 1930s. By his own account,&lt;ref name="urban2006"&gt;Urban, Hugh B. "Fair Game: Secrecy, Security, and the Church of Scientology in Cold War America." ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'' '''74''':2 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; LRH had been injured by the premature detonation of a primer mechanism on a small depth charge that had become stuck in the launch rack aboard the navy ship he was assigned to in 1941. His injuries were mainly flash burns to his eyes and so was despatched ashore and he spent a great deal of his recovery time in the [[Naval Hospital Oakland|Oak Knoll Naval Hospital's]] library, (despite claiming in his authorised biography that he was blinded). LRH encountered the work of Thompson, Korzybski, Jung, Freud, Perls and other [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]].

In his 1955 Phoenix Lectures Series, Hubbard himself, explains that he took the opportunity to enter an office where research papers on the US Naval Medical Research Division's work on PTSD were kept in a filing cabinet and he spent the lunch hour free to read the notes left lying on the desk of the Naval Medical Officer involved. Much of what he learned then, along with his recent mastery of hypnotherapy technique by mail order, was influential in his later development of ideas and concepts for Dianetics Therapy from 1947 onwards. All he needed was medical and scientific testing and approval from any source. However, his several attempts were blocked by several luminaries of the (AMA) American Medical Association in the years 1948–1958, such as Professors Duncan Cameron and Allan Whyte (White), who both were senior authorities within the AMA-funded Psychiatric Research Department, then conducting their own research into drug therapies and controversial psycho-surgical techniques on severely traumatised war veterans.

Hubbard claimed in his several public lectures during the 1950s to have "undertaken clinical research at several of the institutions" they, Cameron and Whyte, had directed. Historical AMA records show that LRH was never officially involved in any approved clinical trials or research into PTSD. It is thought that Hubbard simply privately visited patients and conducted unauthorised interviews with several war veterans suffering from Trauma, Psychosomatic illness and practiced some of the newly identified PTSD techniques being clinically tested by several AMA medical institutions after WW2. (from personal Interviews with Joseph A. Winter, in Peoria,1959).

In April 1950, Hubbard, and several others, (Marjorie Cameron, De Mille, Art Ceppos, AE Van Vogt, Joseph A. Winter, MD.), established the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]] to coordinate work related to the forthcoming publication of DMSMH by Random House in May 1950 in NYC. Through the marketing efforts of Hubbard's friend and mentor John W. Campbell Jnr., (editor of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]'' of Street and Smith fame), Hubbard's articles on Dianetics hit the newsstands in NYC and became an overnight sensation among the usual readers with almost 350,000 copies sold of the May 1950 issue. (See interviews with John Campbell in his published 1978 biography.)

=== Publication ===
Hubbard first introduced Dianetics to the public in the article ''[[Dianetics: The Evolution of a Science]]'' published in the May 1950 issue of the magazine ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]''.&lt;ref name="Creation"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.solitarytrees.net/pubs/skent/creation.htm?FACTNet#txtref02 | title = The Creation of 'Religious' Scientology | publisher = Religious Studies and Theology | accessdate = 8 May 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070312004725/http://www.solitarytrees.net/pubs/skent/creation.htm?FACTNet#txtref02 | archivedate = 12 March 2007 | df = dmy-all }} Originally published by Stephen A. Kent in December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard wrote ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' at that time, allegedly completing the 180,000-word book in six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;"L.R.H. Biography," Sea Org Flag Information Letter 67, 31 October 1977&lt;/ref&gt;  The introduction of the book was the subject of an Associated Press article on 29 March 1950, with the lead "Discovery of a sub-mind is claimed in a new book entitled ''Dianetics''".&lt;ref&gt;''Tucson (AZ) Daily Citizen'', 29 March 1950, p12&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''Dianetics'' was published in 1950, Hubbard announced in the opening pages, "The first contribution of Dianetics is the discovery that the problems of thought and mental function can be resolved within the bounds of the finite universe, which is to say that all data needful to the solution of mental action and Man's endeavor can be measured, sensed and experienced as scientific truths independent of mysticism or metaphysics." This was in line with Hubbard's initial presentation of Dianetics as a science, almost four years before he founded Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The creation of 'religious' Scientology |journal=Religious Studies and Theology |date=2 December 1999 |last=Kent |first=Stephen A |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=97–126 |issn=0829-2922 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publication of ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health'' brought in a flood of money, which Hubbard used to establish Dianetics foundations in six major American cities. Dianetics shared The New York Times best-seller list with other self-help writings, including Norman Vincent Peale's ''The Art of Happiness'' and Henry Overstreet's ''The Mature Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Urban |first1=Hugh B. |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8lgHtauc5R4C&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=Dianetics+New+York+Times+best-seller+list+Norman+Vincent+Peale&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vL2kBcYGFL&amp;sig=VyX8O0clY0avqR7AqV5Hdx8OSsE&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVpanBhvbLAhVK4SYKHTJgCgAQ6AEIKjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Dianetics%20New%20York%20Times%20best-seller%20list%20Norman%20Vincent%20Peale&amp;f=false |title=The Church of Scientology: A History of a New Religion |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2011 |isbn=9780691146089 |accessdate=6 May 2016 |quote=While Dianetics may seem implausible to many readers today, it shared the same New York Times best-seller list with other self-help manuals such as Norman Vincent Peale's True Art of Happiness and Henry Overstreet's The Mature Mind }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Hugh B. Urban asserted that the initial success of Dianetics was reflective of Hubbard's "remarkable entrepreneurial skills."&lt;ref name="Urban 2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Urban |first1=Hugh B. |title=The Church of Scientology: A History of a New Religion |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Posthumously, Publisher's Weekly awarded Hubbard a plaque to acknowledge Dianetics appearing on its bestseller list for one hundred weeks, consecutively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sacred Texts in the United States |journal=Book History |year=2001 |last=Gutjahr |first=Paul C. |volume=4 |pages=335–70 |jstor=30227336 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the initial strongest supporters of Dianetics in the 1950s were John W. Campbell, editor of Astounding Science Fiction and Joseph Augustus Winter, a writer and medical physician. Campbell published some of Hubbard's short stories and Winter hoped that his colleagues would likewise be attracted to Hubbard's Dianetics system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gallagher |first1=Eugene V. |title=The New Religious Movements Experience in America |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2004 |isbn=9780313328077 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1951, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners instituted proceedings against the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Elizabeth for 'teaching medicine without a licence', which was quickly resolved when the courts were made aware that the HDRF deputy director Winter was registered as an MD in the state of Michigan and New York. .&lt;ref&gt;''Bulletin of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation'', Elizabeth, NJ. January 1951&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation closed its doors when Hubbard ditched the Foundation, causing the proceedings to be vacated, but its creditors began to demand settlement of its outstanding debts. Don Purcell, a millionaire Dianeticist from [[Wichita, Kansas]], offered a brief respite from bankruptcy, but the Wichita Foundation's finances soon failed again in 1952 when Hubbard ran off to Phoenix with all his Dianetics materials to avoid the court bailiffs sent in by Don Purcell, who had paid a considerable amount of money to Hubbard for the copyrights to Dianetics in an effort to keep Hubbard from bankruptcy again.&lt;ref name="barefaced"&gt;{{cite book | author=Miller, Russell | authorlink=Russell Miller| title=Bare-faced Messiah, The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard | publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co | location=New York | edition=First American | year=1987 | isbn=0-8050-0654-0 | pages = 305–306 | url = http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/bfm/bfmconte.htm |chapter=11. Bankrolling and Bankruptcy | chapterurl=http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/bfm/bfm11.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, Hubbard defined Scientology as a religion focused on the spirit, differentiating it from Dianetics, and subsequently Dianetics Auditing Therapy, which he defined as a counseling based science that addressed the physical being. He stated, "Dianetics is a science which applies to man, a living organism; and Scientology is a religion."&lt;ref name="Urban 2011"/&gt; When Hubbard morphed Dianetics therapy into the religion of Scientology, Jesper Aagaard Petersen of Oxford University surmises that it could have been for the benefits from establishing it is a religion as much as it could have been from the result of Hubbard's "discovery of past life experiences and his exploration of the thetan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Petersen |first1=Jesper Aagaard |title=Controversial New Religions |publisher=Oxford University |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason being to avoid copyright infringement issues with use of the name Dianetics then held by Don Purcell. Purcell later donated the copyright ownership back (to Hubbard) after Winter and Van Vogt had independently negotiated charitable debt relief with the disenchanted oil millionaire Purcell.

With the temporary sale of assets resulting from the HDRF's bankruptcy, Hubbard no longer owned the rights to the name "Dianetics",&lt;ref name="barefaced"/&gt; but its philosophical framework still provided the seed for Scientology to grow. Scientologists refer to the book ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health'' as "Book One." In 1952, Hubbard published a new set of teachings as "Scientology, a religious philosophy." Scientology did not replace Dianetics but extended it to cover new areas: Where the goal of Dianetics is to rid the individual of his [[reactive mind]] [[engram (Dianetics)|engrams]], the stated goal of Scientology is to rehabilitate the individual's spiritual nature so that he may reach his full potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lebron |first1=Robyn E. |title=Searching for Spiritual Unity...can There Be Common Ground?: A Basic Internet Guide to Forty World Religions &amp; Spiritual Practices |publisher=Crossbooks |year=2012 |isbn=1462712614 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 and again in May 1969, Hubbard reorganized the material in Dianetics, the auditing commands, and original Volney Mathieson invented [[E-meter]] use, naming the package "Standard Dianetics."  In a 1969 bulletin, "This bulletin combines HCOB 27 April 1969 'R-3-R Restated' with those parts of HCOB 24 June 1963 'Routine 3-R' used in the new Standard Dianetic Course and its application. This gives the complete steps of Routine 3-R Revised."&lt;ref&gt;''HCOB 6 May 69 II "Routine 3-R Revised, Engram Running by Chains"''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Hubbard released ''New Era Dianetics'' (NED), a revised version supposed to produce better results in a shorter period of time. The course consists of 11 [[rundown (Scientology)|rundowns]] and requires a specifically trained auditor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.auditing.org/13-ned.htm| title=New Era Dianetics Auditing| accessdate=5 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to Standard Dianetics, but the person being audited is encouraged to find the decision or "postulate" he made during or as a result of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;L. Ron Hubbard ''New Era Dianetics Series 7RA'', HCOB 28 June 1978RA revised 15 September 1978, Hubbard Communications Office (HCO).&lt;/ref&gt;  ("Postulate" in Dianetics and Scientology has the meaning of "a conclusion, decision or resolution made by the individual himself; to conclude, decide or resolve a problem or to set a pattern for the future or to nullify a pattern of the past"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientology.ie/p_jpg/wis/wiseng/gloss.htm#p |title=The Official Scientology and Dianetics Glossary |publisher=Scientology.ie |accessdate=22 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428234523/http://www.scientology.ie/p_jpg/wis/wiseng/gloss.htm#p |archivedate=28 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to its conventional meanings.)

==Basic concepts==
In the book, ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'', Hubbard describes techniques that he suggests can rid individuals of fears and psychosomatic illnesses. A basic idea in Dianetics is that the mind consists of two parts: the "analytical mind" and the "[[reactive mind]]." The "reactive mind", the mind which operates when a person is physically unconscious, acts as a record of shock, trauma, pain, and otherwise harmful memories. Experiences such as these, stored in the "reactive mind" are dubbed "[[engram (Dianetics)|engrams]]". Dianetics is proposed as a method to erase these engrams in the reactive mind to achieve a state of [[Clear (Scientology)|clear]].&lt;ref name="James R.

Hubbard described Dianetics as "an organized science of thought built on definite axioms: statements of [[natural law]]s on the order of those of the physical sciences".&lt;ref&gt;Winter, J.A. ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 18 (Julian Press, 1987 reprint)&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1950, before the public release of Dianetics, he wrote: "To date, over two hundred patients have been treated; of those two hundred, two hundred cures have been obtained."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "Dianetics". ''Astounding Science Fiction'', May 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dianetics, the unconscious or reactive mind is described as a collection of "mental image pictures," which contain the recorded experience of past moments of unconsciousness, including all sensory perceptions and feelings involved, ranging from [[pre-natal]] experiences, infancy and childhood, to even the traumatic feelings associated with events from past lives and extraterrestrial cultures. The type of mental image picture created during a period of [[unconsciousness]] involves the exact recording of a painful experience. Hubbard called this phenomenon an [[engram (Dianetics)|engram]], and defined it as "a complete recording of a moment of unconsciousness containing physical pain or painful emotion and all perceptions."&lt;ref&gt;[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]] page 79 and Glossary&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard said that in Dianetics, it was the analytical mind and not the reactive mind that was the most important because the analytical mind "computes decisions" even when these are dictated by the reactive mind. The damage and aberration caused by the reactive mind would not be possible without the analytic mind. Hubbard stated, "the analytical is so important to the intelligent being and the somatic mind so important to the athlete that Dianetics processing can be said to consist of deintensifying the reactive mind so that the analytical and somatic minds can be free to function properly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rethinking Scientology A Thorough Analysis of L. Ron Hubbard’s Formulation of Therapy and Religion in Dianetics and Scientology, 1950–1986 |journal=Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review |date=June 24, 2016 |last=Christensen |first=Dorthe Refslund |doi=10.5840/asrr201662323 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard proposed that painful physical or emotional traumas caused "aberrations" (deviations from rational thinking) in the mind, which produced lasting adverse physical and emotional effects, similar to [[conversion disorders]]. When the analytical (conscious) mind shut down during these moments, events and perceptions of this period were stored as engrams in the unconscious or reactive mind.  (In Hubbard's earliest publications on the subject, engrams were variously referred to as "Norns",&lt;ref name="Creation"/&gt; "Impediments," and "comanomes" before "engram" was adapted from its existing usage at the suggestion of Joseph Augustus Winter, MD.)&lt;ref name="Blue Sky"&gt;{{cite book | last = Atack | first = Jon | authorlink = Jon Atack | year = 1990 | title = A Piece of Blue Sky | publisher = Carol Publishing Group | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-8184-0499-X| page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators noted Dianetics's blend of science fiction and [[occult]] orientations at the time.&lt;ref name="Creation"/&gt;

Hubbard claimed that these engrams are the cause of almost all psychological and physical problems. In addition to physical pain, engrams could include words or phrases spoken in the vicinity while the patient was unconscious. For instance, Winter cites the example of a patient with a persistent headache supposedly tracing the problem to a doctor saying, "Take him now," during the patient's birth.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;  Hubbard similarly claimed that [[leukemia]] is traceable to "an engram containing the phrase 'It turns my blood to water.'"&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''A History of Man'', p.20. American Saint Hill Organization, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;  While it is sometimes claimed that the Church of Scientology no longer stands by Hubbard's claims that Dianetics can treat physical conditions, it still publishes them:  "... when the knee injuries of the past are located and discharged, the [[arthritis]] ceases, no other injury takes its place and the person is finished with arthritis of the knee."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. [http://www.smi.org/route/page06.htm "The Discoveries of Dianetics"]. Retrieved 22 April 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211210501/http://www.smi.org/route/page06.htm |date=11 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[The reactive mind] can give a man arthritis, [[bursitis]], [[asthma]], [[allergy|allergies]], [[sinusitis]], [[Coronary circulation|coronary]] trouble, high [[blood pressure]] ... And it is the only thing in the human being which can produce these effects ... Discharge the content of [the reactive mind] and the arthritis vanishes, [[myopia]] gets better, heart illness decreases, asthma disappears, stomachs function properly and the whole catalog of ills goes away and stays away."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. [http://www.dianetics.org/en_US/info/01/pg003.html "What is the Reactive Mind?"].

Hubbard defined the third mind, or the somatic mind, as "that mind which, directed by the analytical or reactive mind, places solution into effect on the physical level." If an individual is not suffering from aberration or engrams are not restimulated, thus causing the person to relive pain, the analytical mind controls the somatic mind, in turn controlling blood flow, the heartbeat and endocrines. When a person is "aberrated," the reactive mind controls the somatic mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rethinking Scientology A Thorough Analysis of L. Ron Hubbard’s Formulation of Therapy and Religion in Dianetics and Scientology, 1950–1986 |journal=Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review |date=June 24, 2016 |last=Christensen |first=Dorthe Refslund |doi=10.5840/asrr201662323 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the [[psychometrics|psychometric]] ideas in Dianetics, in particular the [[E-meter]], can be traced to [[Carl Jung]]. Basic concepts, including [[conversion disorder]], are derived from [[Sigmund Freud]], whom Hubbard credited as an inspiration and source.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from John W. Campbell, cited in Winter, p. 3 - "His approach is, actually, based on some very early work of Freud"&lt;/ref&gt; Freud had speculated 40 years previously that traumas with similar content join together in "chains," embedded in the unconscious mind, to cause irrational responses in the individual. Such a chain would be relieved by inducing the patient to remember the earliest trauma, "with an accompanying expression of emotion."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Breuer and Sigmund Freud, "Studies in Hysteria", Vol II of the ''Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''. Hogarth Press, London (1955).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Ron Hubbard ''A Critique of Psychoanalysis'', PAB 92, 10 July 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bent Corydon, Hubbard created the illusion that Dianetics was the first [[psychotherapy]] to address [[traumatic experience]]s in their own time, but others had done so as standard procedure.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20130613033101/http://anonireland.com/content/wppdfcontent/books/messiahormadmen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

One treatment method Hubbard drew from in developing Dianetics was [[abreaction therapy]].  [[Abreaction]] is a [[psychoanalytical]] [[technical terminology|term]] that means bringing to [[consciousness]], and thus adequate expression, material that has been unconscious. "It includes not only the recollection of forgotten memories and [[experience]], but also their reliving with appropriate emotional display and discharge of effect. This process is usually facilitated by the patient's gaining awareness of the [[causal relationship]] between the previously undischarged [[emotion]] and his [[symptom]]s."&lt;ref&gt;Bent Corydon ''L. Ron Hubbard, Messiah or Madman?'', pp. 283-4, Barricade Books Inc., 1992 {{ISBN|0-942637-57-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hubbard, before Dianetics psychotherapists had dealt with very light and superficial incidents (e.g. an incident that reminds the patient of a moment of loss), but with Dianetic therapy, the patient could actually erase moments of pain and unconsciousness. He emphasized: "The discovery of the engram is entirely the property of Dianetics. Methods of its erasure are also owned entirely by Dianetics..."&lt;ref&gt;''A Critique of Psychoanalysis'', ibid. Pab 92&lt;/ref&gt;

While 1950 style Dianetics was in some respects similar to older therapies, with the development of New Era Dianetics in 1978, the similarity vanished. New Era Dianetics uses an E-Meter and a rote procedure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=L Ron|title=R3RA Commands|journal=HCO Bulletin 28 June 1978RA|series=New Era Dianetics Series 7RA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  for running ''chains'' of related traumatic incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=L Ron|title=Routine 3RA Engram Running by Chains|journal=HCO Bulletin 26 June 1978RA Iss II|series=New Era Dianetics series 6RA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dianetics clarifies the understanding of psychosomatic illness in terms of ''predisposition'', ''precipitation'', and ''prolongation''.

{{quotation|'''HCO Bulletin 11 July 1973RB'''

Injury and illness are PREDISPOSED by the spiritual state of the person. They are PRECIPITATED by the being himself as a manifestation of his current spiritual condition. And they are PROLONGED by any failure to fully handle the spiritual factors associated with them.|Hubbard, LR|Assist Summary}}

With the use of Dianetics techniques, Hubbard claimed, the reactive mind could be processed and all stored engrams could be refiled as experience. The central technique was "auditing," a two-person [[talk therapy|question-and-answer therapy]] designed to isolate and dissipate engrams (or "mental masses"). An auditor addresses questions to a subject, observes and records the subject's responses, and returns repeatedly to experiences or areas under discussion that appear painful until the troubling experience has been identified and confronted. Through repeated applications of this method, the reactive mind could be "cleared" of its content having outlived its usefulness in the [[Process (science)|process]] of [[evolution]]; a person who has completed this process would be "Clear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first1=Lawrence |title=Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison of Belief |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4IDPV2hZL0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=l.+ron+hubbard+dianetics+reactive+mind+clear&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibg9vpoZrRAhVD0oMKHdhfAKEQ6AEINDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=reactive%20mind&amp;f=false |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |year=2013 |isbn=9780385350273 |accessdate=2016-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits of going Clear, according to Hubbard, were dramatic. A Clear would have no compulsions, repressions, [[psychosis|psychoses]] or [[neurosis|neuroses]], and would enjoy a near-perfect memory as well as a rise in [[IQ]] of as much as 50 points. He also claimed that "the atheist is activated by engrams as thoroughly as the zealot".&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "Dianetics and Religion," ''Dianetic Auditor's Bulletin'' vol. 1 no. 4, October 1950&lt;/ref&gt; He further claimed that widespread application of Dianetics would result in "A world without [[insanity]], without criminals and without war."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''Science of Survival: Prediction of Human Behavior'' p. 1, Bridge Publications, 1990 (reissue).&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key ideas of Dianetics, according to Hubbard, is the fundamental existential command to survive. According to Hugh B. Urban, this would serve as the foundation of a big part of later Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Urban |first1=Hugh B. |title=The Church of Scientology: A History of a New Religion |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=22 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Scientology journal ''The Auditor'', the total number of "Clears" as of May 2006 stands at 50,311.&lt;ref&gt;"The Auditor," The Monthly Journal of Scientology, published by the American Saint Hill Organization, 1413 L. Ron Hubbard Way, Los Angeles, CA 90027, Issue 330, May 2006, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Hubbard presented Dianetics, he did so in terms of ''terra incognita,'' or to Scientologists the human mind. Hubbard wrote, “Dianetics is an adventure. It is an exploration of terra incognita, the human mind, the vast and hitherto unknown realm half an inch back of our foreheads." According to ''Scientology in Popular Culture,'' Hubbard set out to colonize terra incognita, where in the “practice of empire was auditing, the new technology of empire was the E-meter. This exploration of the human mind “would become a defining feature of Scientology because it provided the portal through which he could conquer many enemy thetans.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kent |first1=Stephen A. |last2=Raine |first2=Susan |title=Scientology in Popular Culture: Influences and Struggles for Legitimacy |location=Santa Barbara, California |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2017 |isbn= 978-1440832499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure in practice==
[[File:Dianetics demo at Union Station.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Scientologist]]s promoting Dianetics at [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] in Washington, D.C.]]
The procedure of Dianetics therapy (known as ''auditing'') is a two-person activity. One person, the "auditor", guides the other person, the "pre-clear". The pre-Clear's job is to look at the mind and talk to the auditor. The auditor acknowledges what the pre-Clear says and controls the process so the pre-Clear may put his full attention on his work.

The auditor and pre-Clear sit down in chairs facing each other. The process then follows in eleven distinct steps:&lt;ref&gt;This description is based on "[http://www.rehabilitatenz.co.nz/pages/dianetics-auditing-steps.html The Dianetics Procedure - 10 Simple Steps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030226223940/http://www.rehabilitatenz.co.nz/pages/dianetics-auditing-steps.html |date=26 February 2003 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;

*1. The auditor assures the pre-Clear that he will be fully aware of everything that happens during the session.
*2. The pre-Clear is instructed to close his eyes for the session, entering a state of "dianetic reverie", signified by "a tremble of the lashes". During the session, the preclear remains in full possession of his will and retains full recall thereafter.
*3. The auditor installs a "canceller", an instruction intended to absolutely cancel any form of positive suggestion that could accidentally occur. This is done by saying "In the future, when I utter the word 'cancelled,' everything I have said to you while you are in a therapy session will be cancelled and will have no force with you. Any suggestion I may have made to you will be without force when I say the word 'cancelled.' Do you understand?"
*4. The auditor then asks the pre-Clear to locate an exact record of something that happened to the pre-Clear in his past: "Locate an incident that you feel you can comfortably face."
*5. The pre-Clear is invited by the auditor to "Go through the incident and say what is happening as you go along."
*6a. The auditor instructs the pre-Clear to recall as much as possible of the incident, going over it several times "until the pre-Clear is cheerful about it".
*6b. When the pre-Clear is cheerful about an incident, the auditor instructs the pre-Clear to locate another incident: "Let's find another incident that you feel you can comfortably face." The process outlined at steps 5 and 6a then repeats until the auditing session's time limit (usually two hours or so) is reached.
*7. The pre-Clear is then instructed to "return to present time".
*8. The auditor checks to make sure that the pre-Clear feels himself to be in "present time", i.e., not still recalling a past incident.
*9. The auditor gives the pre-Clear the canceller word: "Very good. Cancelled."
*10. The auditor tells the pre-Clear to feel alert and return to full awareness of his surroundings: "When I count from five to one and snap my fingers you will feel alert. Five, four, three, two, one." (snaps fingers)

Auditing sessions are supposedly kept confidential. A few transcripts of auditing sessions with [[Sanitization (classified information)|confidential information removed]] have been published as demonstration examples. Some extracts can be found in J.A. Winter's book ''[[Dianetics: A Doctor's Report]]''. Other, more comprehensive, transcripts of auditing sessions carried out by Hubbard himself can be found in volume 1 of the ''Research &amp; Discovery Series'' (Bridge Publications, 1980). Examples of public group processing sessions can be found throughout the ''Congresses'' lecture series.

According to Hubbard, auditing enables the pre-Clear to "contact" and "release" engrams stored in the reactive mind, relieving him of the physical and mental aberrations connected with them. The pre-Clear is asked to inspect and familiarize himself with the exact details of his own experience; the auditor may not tell him anything about his case or evaluate any of the information the pre-Clear finds.

==Criticism==

Hubbard's original book on Dianetics attracted highly critical reviews from science and medical writers and organizations. The [[American Psychological Association]] passed a resolution in 1950 calling "attention to the fact that these claims are not supported by [[empiricism|empirical]] evidence of the sort required for the establishment of scientific generalizations."&lt;ref&gt;"Psychologists Act Against Dianetics", ''New York Times'', 9 September 1950&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=timeapa&gt;{{cite news | title = Tests &amp; Poison | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,813284,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] | date = 18 September 1950 | accessdate = 10 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Dianetics has achieved no acceptance as a [[scientific theory]], and scientists cite Dianetics as an example of a [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;See e.g. Gardner, ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]''; Bauer, ''Scientific Literacy and the Myth of the Scientific Method'' and ''Science Or Pseudoscience: Magnetic Healing, Psychic Phenomena, and Other Heterodoxies''; Corsini ''et al.'', ''The Dictionary of Psychology''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Demise of the Dogmatic Universe|title=Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences|author=Ari Ben-Menahem|isbn=978-3-540-68831-0|year=2009|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-68832-7|pages=4301–4302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1950, amidst the success of ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health|Dianetics]]'', Hubbard held a demonstration in Los Angeles' [[Shrine Auditorium]] where he presented a young woman called Sonya Bianca (a pseudonym) to a large audience including many reporters and photographers as 'the world's first [[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]]."  Despite Hubbard's claim that she had "full and perfect recall of every moment of her life", Bianca proved unable to answer questions from the audience testing her memory and analytical abilities, including the question of the color of Hubbard's tie.  Hubbard explained Bianca's failure to display her promised powers of recall to the audience by saying that he had used the word "now" in calling her to the stage, and thus inadvertently froze her in "present time," which blocked her abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Russell|last=Miller|title=Bare-Faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard|year=1987|isbn=0-8050-0654-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atack"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jon|last=Atack|title=A Piece of Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianetics and L. Ron Hubbard Exposed|year=1990|isbn=0-8184-0499-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the late 1950s, Hubbard would claim that several people had reached the state of Clear by the time he presented Bianca as the world's first; these others, Hubbard said, he had successfully cleared in the late 1940s while working ''incognito'' in Hollywood posing as a [[swami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech| first=L. Ron| last=Hubbard| title=The Story of Dianetics and Scientology, Lecture 18| date=October 1958| quote="by 1947, I had achieved clearing."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Hubbard declared South African Scientologist John McMaster to be the first true Clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Alan|last=Levy|title=Scientology|journal=Life|date=15 November 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Wendy|last=Michener|title=Is This the Happiest Man in the World?|journal=Maclean's|date=22 August 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few scientific investigations into the effectiveness of Dianetics have been published. Professor [[John A. Lee (professor)|John A. Lee]] states in his 1970 evaluation of Dianetics:

{{quote|Objective experimental verification of Hubbard's [[physiology|physiological]] and psychological doctrines is lacking. To date, no regular scientific agency has established the validity of his theories of prenatal perception and engrams, or cellular memory, or Dianetic reverie, or the effects of Scientology auditing routines. Existing knowledge contradicts Hubbard's theory of recording of perceptions during periods of unconsciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, John A. ''Sectarian Healers and Hypnotherapy'', 1970, Ontario&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[MEDLINE]] database records two independent scientific studies on Dianetics, both conducted in the 1950s under the auspices of [[New York University]]. Harvey Jay Fischer tested Dianetics therapy against three claims made by proponents and found it does not effect any significant changes in intellectual functioning, mathematical ability, or the degree of personality conflicts;&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Harvey Jay. "Dianetic therapy: an experimental evaluation. A statistical analysis of the effect of dianetic therapy as measured by group tests of intelligence, mathematics and personality." Abstract of Ph.D. thesis, 1953, New York University ([http://home.snafu.de/tilman/krasel/dianetics_test2.html Excerpt])&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Fox tested Hubbard's thesis regarding recall of engrams, with the assistance of the Dianetic Research Foundation, and could not substantiate it.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, J.; Davis, A.E.; Lebovits, B. "An experimental investigation of Hubbard's engram hypothesis (dianetics)". ''Psychological Newsletter'', New York University. 10 1959, 131-134&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard claimed, in an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'' in November 1950, that "he had already submitted proof of claims made in the book to a number of scientists and associations." He added that the public as well as proper organizations were entitled to such proof and that he was ready and willing to give such proof in detail.&lt;ref&gt;"Psychologists Act Against Dianetics", New York Times, 9 September 1950&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1951, the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation of [[Elizabeth, NJ]] published ''Dianetic Processing: A Brief Survey of Research Projects and Preliminary Results'', a booklet providing the results of psychometric tests conducted on 88 people undergoing Dianetics therapy. It presents case histories and a number of [[X-ray]] plates to support claims that Dianetics had cured "aberrations" including [[Bipolar disorder|manic depression]], asthma, [[arthritis]], [[colitis]] and "overt homosexuality," and that after Dianetic processing, test subjects experienced significantly increased scores on a standardized IQ test. The report's subjects are not identified by name, but one of them is clearly Hubbard himself ("Case 1080A, R. L.").&lt;ref&gt;Benton, Peggy; Ibanex, Dalmyra.; Southon, Gordon; Southon, Peggy. ''Dianetic Processing: A Brief Survey of Research Projects and Preliminary Results'', Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors provide no qualifications, although they are described in Hubbard's book ''Science of Survival'' (where some results of the same study were reprinted) as psychotherapists. Critics of Dianetics are skeptical of this study, both because of the bias of the source and because the researchers appear to ascribe all physical benefits to Dianetics without considering possible outside factors; in other words, the report lacks any [[scientific control]]s. J.A. Winter, M.D., originally an associate of Hubbard and an early adopter of Dianetics, had by the end of 1950 cut his ties with Hubbard and written an account of his personal experiences with Dianetics. He described Hubbard as "absolutistic and authoritarian",&lt;ref name=departure/&gt; and criticized the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation for failing to undertake "precise scientific research into the functioning of the mind".&lt;ref&gt;Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; He also recommended that auditing be done by experts only and that it was dangerous for laymen to audit each other.&lt;ref name=departure&gt;{{cite news | title = Departure in Dianetics | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,821638,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] | date = 3 September 1951 | accessdate = 14 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard writes: "Again, Dianetics is not being released to a profession, for no profession could encompass it."&lt;ref&gt;L. Ron Hubbard ''Dianetics: the Modernd Science of Mental Health'', p. 204, Bridge Publications Inc., 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-4031-4484-3}}; 1st ed. 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators from a variety of backgrounds have described Dianetics as an example of pseudoscience. For example, [[philosophy]] professor [[Robert Todd Carroll|Robert Carroll]] points to Dianetics' lack of empirical evidence:

{{quote|What Hubbard touts as a science of mind lacks one key element that is expected of a science: empirical testing of claims. The key elements of Hubbard's so-called science don't seem testable, yet he repeatedly claims that he is asserting only scientific facts and data from many experiments. It isn't even clear what such "data" would look like. Most of his data is in the form of anecdotes and speculations ... Such speculation is appropriate in fiction, but not in science.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Todd Carroll|Carroll, Robert T.]] [http://skepdic.com/dianetic.html "Dianetics"], ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[W. Sumner Davis]] similarly comments that

{{quote|Dianetics is nothing more than an example of pseudoscience trying to legitimize itself ... Hubbard, had he indeed been a scientist, would have known that truth is not built on axioms, and facts cannot be found from some a-priori knowledge. A true science is constructed on [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], which are arrived at by the virtue of observed phenomena. Scientific knowledge is gained by observation and testing, not believing from some [[subconscious]] stipulation, as Hubbard would have us believe.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, W. Sumner. ''Just Smoke and Mirrors: Religion, Fear and Superstition in Our Modern World'', Writers Club Press, 2001 ({{ISBN|0-595-26523-5}})&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The validity and practice of auditing have been questioned by a variety of non-Scientologist commentators. Commenting on the example cited by Winter, the science writer [[Martin Gardner]] asserts that "nothing could be clearer from the above dialogue than the fact that the dianetic explanation for the headache existed only in the mind of the therapist, and that it was with considerable difficulty that the patient was maneuvered into accepting it."&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Martin. '' Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science''. Dover, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics and medical experts have suggested that Dianetic auditing is a form of [[hypnosis]],&lt;ref&gt;"Never believe a hypnotist - An investigation of L. Ron Hubbard's statements about hypnosis and its relationship to his Dianetics.", Jon Atack&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Psychologist says church appeared to use hypnosis", ''Irish Times'', 13 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The 'Scientology Organization' (SO) as of July 2003", chapter 2, Landesamt für Verfassungsschutz Baden-Wuerttemberg, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; although the Church of Scientology has strongly denied that hypnosis forms any part of Dianetics.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.scientology.org/en_US/news-media/faq/pg005.html What is auditing?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060413195909/http://www.scientology.org/en_US/news-media/faq/pg005.html |date=13 April 2006 }}", Church of Scientology International&lt;/ref&gt; To the contrary, L. Ron Hubbard expressly warns not to use any hypnosis or hypnosis-like methods, because a person under hypnosis would be receptive to suggestions. This would decrease his self-determinism instead of increasing it, which is one of the prime goals of Dianetics.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Science of Survival]]", L. Ron Hubbard, p. 461 (2007 edition).&lt;/ref&gt; Winter [1950] comments that the leading nature of the questions asked of a pre-Clear "encourage fantasy", a common issue also encountered with hypnosis, which can be used to form [[confabulation|false memories]]. The auditor is instructed not to make any assessment of a recalled memory's reality or accuracy, but instead to treat it as if it were objectively real. Professor [[Richard Ofshe|Richard J. Ofshe]], a leading expert on false memories, suggests that the feeling of well-being reported by pre-Clear at the end of an auditing session may be induced by post-hypnotic [[suggestion]].&lt;ref&gt;"A Very Brief Overview of Scientology", Richard E. Ofshe, Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have identified quotations in Hubbard's work suggesting evidence that false memories were created in ''Dianetics,'' specifically in the form of birth and pre-birth memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = False memories in therapy and hypnosis before 1980.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/cns0000044|journal = Psychology of Consciousness: Theory, Research, and Practice|pages = 153–169|volume = 2|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/cns0000044|first = Lawrence|last = Patihis|first2 = Helena J.

According to an article by Martin Gumpert, “Hubbard’s concept of psychosomatic disease is definitely wrong. Psychosomatic ailments are not simply caused by emotional disturbances: they are diseases in which the emotional and the organic factor are closely involved and interdependent.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/121590/1950-takedown-l-ron-hubbards-scientology-book-dianetics|title=A Doctor’s Scathing 1950 Takedown of L.

==Autocontrol==
According to Hubbard, the majority of the people interested in the subject believed they could accomplish therapy alone. "It cannot be done" and he adds: "If a patient places himself in [[Self-hypnosis|autohypnosis]] and regresses himself in an effort to reach illness or birth or prenatals, the only thing he will get is ill".&lt;ref&gt;Dianetics: the Modern Science of Mental Health -5oth anniversary edition- pp. 443-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search''' ('''GIMPS''') is a collaborative project of volunteers who use freely available [[software]] to search for [[Mersenne prime|Mersenne prime numbers]].

The GIMPS project was founded by [[George Woltman]] in 1996, who also wrote the software [[Prime95]] and [[MPrime]] for the project. [[Scott Kurowski]] wrote the [http://www.mersenne.org/primenet/ PrimeNet] [[Internet server]] that supports the research to demonstrate [[Entropia, Inc. (company)|Entropia]]-distributed computing software, a company he founded in 1997. GIMPS is registered as '''Mersenne Research, Inc.''' Kurowski is Executive Vice President and board director of [http://v5www.mersenne.org/legal/ Mersenne Research Inc.] GIMPS is said to be one of the first large scale [[distributed computing]] projects over the Internet for research purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Volunteer computing|url=http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/VolunteerComputing|publisher=BOINC|accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018|9}}, the project has found a total of sixteen [[Mersenne prime]]s, fourteen of which were the [[largest known prime number]] at their respective times of discovery. The largest known prime {{as of|2018|1|lc=on|url=http://primes.utm.edu/top20/page.php?id=3}} is 2&lt;sup&gt;77,232,917&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 (or M&lt;sub&gt;77,232,917&lt;/sub&gt; in short). This prime was discovered on December 26, 2017 by Jonathan Pace.&lt;ref name="GIMPS-2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=GIMPS Project Discovers Largest Known Prime Number: 2&lt;sup&gt;77,232,917&lt;/sup&gt;-1 |url=https://www.mersenne.org/primes/press/M77232917.html |date=3 January 2018 |work=Mersenne Research, Inc. |accessdate=3 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To perform its testing, the project relies primarily on [[Lucas–Lehmer primality test]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mersenne.org/faq.htm#what ''What are Mersenne primes? How are they useful?''] - GIMPS Home Page&lt;/ref&gt; an [[algorithm]] that is both specialized to testing Mersenne primes and particularly efficient on [[Binary numeral system|binary]] [[computer architecture]]s. They also have a [[trial division]] phase, used to rapidly eliminate Mersenne numbers with small factors which make up a large proportion of candidates. [[Pollard's p - 1 algorithm]] is also used to search for larger factors.

==History==
The project began in early January 1996,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garlic.com/~wedgingt/newsletters.html#9 The Mersenne Newsletter, Issue #9. Retrieved 2011-10-02.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206050420/http://www.garlic.com/~wedgingt/newsletters.html |date=2012-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=69824&amp;postcount=3 Mersenne forum Retrieved 2011-10-02]&lt;/ref&gt; with a program that ran on [[Intel 80386|i386]] computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The name for the project was coined by Luther Welsh, one of its earlier searchers and the co-discoverer of the 29th Mersenne prime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mersenne.org/newsletters/news9.txt The Mersenne Newsletter, Issue #9]. Retrieved 2009-08-25.&lt;/ref&gt;
Within a few months, several dozen people had joined, and over a thousand by the end of the first year.&lt;ref name="news9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Status==
{{As of|2017|10}}, GIMPS has a sustained aggregate [[throughput]] of approximately 324&amp;nbsp;[[FLOPS|TeraFLOPS (or TFLOPS)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; theoretically earning the GIMPS [[virtual machine|virtual computer]] a rank of 330 among the [[TOP500]] most powerful known computer systems in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TOP500 - November 2012|url=http://www.top500.org/list/2012/11/?page=4|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preceding place was then held by an 'HP Cluster Platform 3000 BL460c G7' of [[Hewlett-Packard]].&lt;ref&gt;TOP500 per November 2012; HP BL460c with 95.1 TFLOP/s (R max).{{cite web|title=TOP500 - Rank 329|url=http://www.top500.org/system/177960|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2014 TOP500 results, these old GIMPS numbers would no longer make the list.&lt;!-- as the last computer is 153.4 TFLOPS RMAX, 317.5 RPEAK
{{As of|2015|04}}, GIMPS has a sustained aggregate [[throughput]] of approximately 238.918&amp;nbsp;TFLOP/s&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

--&gt;

Previously, this was approximately 50&amp;nbsp;TFLOPS in early 2010, 30&amp;nbsp;TFLOPS in mid-2008, 20&amp;nbsp;TFLOPS in mid-2006, and 14&amp;nbsp;TFLOPS in early 2004.

==Software license==
Although the GIMPS software's [[source code]] is publicly available,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft/default.php#source | title=Software Source Code | publisher=Mersenne Research, Inc. | accessdate=March 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; technically it is not [[free software]], since it has a restriction that users must abide by the project's distribution terms.&lt;ref name="legal"&gt;{{Citation
| url = http://www.mersenne.org/legal/
| title = GIMPS Legalese
| publisher = GIMPS
| accessdate = 2011-09-19
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Specifically, if the software is used to discover a prime number with at least 100,000,000 decimal digits, the user will only win $50,000 of the $150,000 prize offered by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].&lt;ref name="legal" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
| url = https://www.eff.org/awards/coop
| title = EFF Cooperative Computing Awards
| publisher = Electronic Frontier Foundation
| accessdate = 2011-09-19
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-party programs for testing Mersenne numbers, such as Mlucas and Glucas (for non-x86 systems), do not have this restriction.

GIMPS also "reserves the right to change this EULA without notice and with reasonable retroactive effect''.''"&lt;ref name="legal" /&gt;

==Primes found==
All Mersenne primes are of the form M&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;=2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1, where ''p'' is a prime number itself. So the smallest Mersenne prime in this table is {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;1398269&lt;/sup&gt; − 1.}}

The first column is the rank of the Mersenne prime in the (ordered) sequence of all Mersenne primes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GIMPS List of Known Mersenne Prime Numbers|url=https://www.mersenne.org/primes/|publisher=Mersenne Research, Inc.|accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; GIMPS has found all known Mersenne primes beginning with the 35th.

{{note label|unverified_index|†|^ †}} {{As of|2018|12|03|df=US}}, 45,724,957  is the largest exponent below which all other prime exponents have been checked twice, so it is not verified whether any undiscovered Mersenne primes exist between the 47th (''M''&lt;sub&gt;43112609&lt;/sub&gt;) and the 50th (''M''&lt;sub&gt;77232917&lt;/sub&gt;) on this chart; the ranking is therefore provisional. Furthermore, 81,716,699 is the largest exponent below which all other prime exponents have been tested at least once, so all Mersenne numbers below the 50th (''M''&lt;sub&gt;77232917&lt;/sub&gt;) have been tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GIMPS Milestones|url=http://www.mersenne.org/report_milestones/|publisher=Mersenne Research, Inc.|accessdate=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{note label|number_size|‡|^ ‡}} The number M&lt;sub&gt;77232917&lt;/sub&gt; has 23,249,425 decimal digits. To help visualize the size of this number, a standard [[word processor]] layout (50 lines per page, 75 digits per line) would require 6,199 pages to display it. If one were to print it out using standard printer paper, single-sided, it would require approximately 12 [[Paper ream|reams]] of paper.

Whenever a possible prime is reported to the server, it is verified first before it is announced. The importance of this was illustrated in 2003, when a false positive was reported to possibly be the 40th Mersenne prime but verification failed.&lt;ref&gt;http://mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?p=6149&lt;/ref&gt;

''InSight''{{'s}} objectives are to place a [[seismometer]], called [[Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure|SEIS]], on the surface of Mars to measure seismic activity and provide accurate 3D models of the planet's interior; and measure internal [[heat transfer|heat flow]] using a heat probe called [[Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package|HP&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]] to study Mars' early geological evolution.&lt;ref name="insight-instrum"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/instruments/ |title=What are InSight's Science Tools? |publisher=NASA |access-date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could bring a new understanding of the Solar System's [[terrestrial planet]]s&amp;nbsp;– [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]]&amp;nbsp;– and Earth's [[Moon]].

A persistent vacuum leak in the [[CNES]]-supplied seismometer known as the [[Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure]] (SEIS) led NASA to postpone the planned launch in March 2016 to May 2018. When ''InSight'' was delayed, the rest of the spacecraft was returned to Lockheed Martin's factory in Colorado for storage, and the [[Atlas V]] rocket intended to launch the spacecraft was reassigned to the ''[[WorldView-4]]'' mission.&lt;ref name="sfnow20160305"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2016/03/05/fate-of-nasas-insight-mars-mission-to-be-decided-soon/ |title=Fate of NASA's InSight Mars mission to be decided soon |work=Spaceflight Now |first=Stephen |last=Clark |date=5 March 2016 |access-date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Science background ===
NASA noted the difficulty of building an interplanetary seismometer when the ''[[Viking 1]]'' lander's seismometer did not deploy properly in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast20jul_1/ |title=Happy Anniversary, Viking Lander |publisher=NASA |work=Science@NASA |date=20 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seismometer on both ''Viking'' spacecraft were mounted on the lander, which meant that it also picked up vibrations from various operations of the lander and from the wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/54355/2/jgr82msapp.pdf |title=Signatures of Internally Generated Lander Vibrations |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |first=Don L. |last=Anderson |display-authors=etal |volume=82 |issue=28 |pages=4524–4546; A-2 |date=September 1977 |doi=10.1029/JS082i028p04524 |bibcode=1977JGR....82.4524A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seismometer readings were used to estimate a Martian geological [[Crust (geology)|crust]] thickness between {{convert|8.7|and|11.2|mi|km|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} at the ''Viking 2'' lander site.&lt;ref name=vikingspace /&gt; The ''Viking 2'' seismometer detected pressure from the Mars winds complementing the meteorology results.&lt;ref name=vikingspace&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.space.com/18803-viking-2.html |title=Viking 2: Second Landing on Mars |work=Space.com |first=Elizabeth |last=Howell |date=6 December 2012 |access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Martian wind activity detected by a seismometer at Viking lander 2 site |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |last1=Nakamura |first1=Y. |last2=Anderson |first2=D.

The wind data did prove useful in its own right, and despite the limitations of the data, widespread and large marsquakes were not detected.&lt;ref name="Lorenz2017"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Viking-2 Seismometer Measurements on Mars: PDS Data Archive and Meteorological Applications |journal=Earth and Space Science |last1=Lorenz |first1=Ralph D. |last2=Nakamura |first2=Yosio |last3=Murphy |first3=James R. |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=681–688 |date=November 2017 |doi=10.1002/2017EA000306 |bibcode=2017E&amp;SS....4..681L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio Doppler measurements were taken with ''Viking'' and twenty years later with ''[[Mars Pathfinder]]'', and in each case the [[Rotation around a fixed axis|axis of rotation]] of Mars was estimated. By combining this data the core size was constrained, because the change in axis of rotation over 20 years allowed a precession rate and from that the planet's [[moment of inertia]] to be estimated.&lt;ref name="Banerdt20130307"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/ssbsite/documents/webpage/ssb_086912.pdf |title=InSight: A Geophysical Mission to a Terrestrial Planet Interior |conference=Committee on Astrobiology and Planetary Science. 6–8 March 2013.

On 26 November 2018, NASA reported that the ''InSight'' lander had landed successfully on Mars. A touchdown image was received, taken through a transparent lens cover. NASA reported that the cover, along with the cover on another camera, would be removed within the next few days. 

A few hours later, at about 1:30 UTC (8:30 p.m. EST), NASA's ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey]]'' orbiter relayed signals indicating that ''InSight''{{'s}} [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]] had successfully unfurled and are generating electrical power. Enough power is being generated to recharge its batteries daily. ''Odyssey'' also relayed a pair of images showing ''InSight''{{'s}} landing site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8393/insight-is-catching-rays-on-mars/?site=insight| title=InSight Is Catching Rays on Mars – NASA's InSight Mars Lander| work=NASA| access-date=2018-11-27| language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; More images will be taken in [[Stereoscopy#Space exploration|stereo]] pairs to create 3D images, allowing ''InSight'' to find the best places to put the heat probe and seismometer.

== Objectives ==
The ''InSight'' mission placed a single stationary lander on Mars to study its deep interior and address a fundamental issue of planetary and Solar System science: understanding the processes that shaped the [[Terrestrial planet|rocky planets]] of the inner Solar System (including Earth) more than four&amp;nbsp;billion years ago.&lt;ref name="missionpg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insight.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/ |title=InSight: Mission |publisher=NASA/[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] |access-date=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Terrestrial Planet Interiors (Earth, Mars and Moon) - Artist's Concept.jpg|thumb|right|Interiors of Earth, Mars and the Moon (artist concept)]]
''InSight''{{'s}} primary objective is to study the earliest evolutionary history of the processes that shaped Mars. By studying the size, thickness, density and overall structure of Mars' [[Planetary core|core]], [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and [[Crust (geology)|crust]], as well as the rate at which heat escapes from the planet's interior, ''InSight'' will provide a glimpse into the evolutionary processes of all of the rocky planets in the inner Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Panning |first1=Mark |last2=Lognonne |first2=Philippe |last3=Banerdt |first3=Bruce |display-authors=etal |title=Planned Products of the Mars Structure Service for the InSight Mission to Mars |journal=Space Science Reviews |date=October 2017 |volume=211 |issue=1-4 |pages=611–650 |doi=10.1007/s11214-016-0317-5 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-016-0317-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="missionpg" /&gt; The rocky inner planets share a common ancestry that begins with a process called [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]]. As the body increases in size, its interior heats up and evolves to become a [[terrestrial planet]], containing a core, mantle and crust.&lt;ref name="ISScience"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insight.jpl.nasa.gov/science/ |title=InSight: Science |publisher=NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory |access-date=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this common ancestry, each of the terrestrial planets is later shaped and molded through a poorly understood process called [[Planetary differentiation|differentiation]]. ''InSight'' mission's goal is to improve the understanding of this process and, by extension, terrestrial evolution, by measuring the planetary building blocks shaped by this differentiation: a terrestrial planet's core, mantle and crust.&lt;ref name="ISScience" /&gt;
[[File:PIA22745-Mars-InSightLander-ArtistConcept-20181030.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''InSight'' lander on Mars (artist concept)]]
The mission will determine if there is any [[Earthquake|seismic activity]], measure the rate of heat flow from the interior, estimate the size of Mars' [[Planetary core|core]] and whether the core is liquid or solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.universetoday.com/93843/nasas-proposed-insight-lander-would-peer-to-the-center-of-mars-in-2016/ |title=NASAs Proposed 'InSight' Lander would Peer to the Center of Mars in 2016 |work=Universe Today |first=Ken |last=Kremer |date=2 March 2012 |access-date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This data would be the first of its kind for Mars.&lt;ref name=bb13 /&gt; It is also expected that frequent [[Air burst|meteor airbursts]] (10–200 detectable events per year for ''InSight'') will provide additional seismo-acoustic signals to probe the interior of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Bolide Airbursts as a Seismic Source for the 2018 Mars InSight Mission |journal=Space Science Reviews |first1=J. |last1=Stevanović |first2=N.A. |last2=Teanby |first3=J. |last3=Wookey |first4=N. |last4=Selby |first5=I.

Measurements of crust thickness, mantle viscosity, core radius and density, and seismic activity should result in a three- to tenfold increase in accuracy compared to current data.&lt;ref name=bb13 /&gt;

In terms of fundamental processes shaping planetary formation, it is thought that Mars contains the most in-depth and accurate historical record, because it is big enough to have undergone the earliest [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] and internal heating processes that shaped the terrestrial planets, but is small enough to have retained signs of those processes.&lt;ref name="missionpg" /&gt;

The lander will then begin its mission of observing Mars, which is expected to last for two years.&lt;ref name="nasa201208" /&gt;

{{Wikinews|NASA's InSight lander and MarCO craft launch in new mission to Mars}}
The spacecraft was launched on 5 May 2018 at 11:05&amp;nbsp;UTC on an Atlas V 401 launch vehicle (AV-078) from [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 3|Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 3-East]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20180505" /&gt; This was the first American [[interplanetary mission]] to launch from California.&lt;ref name="nasa20131219" /&gt;

The launch was managed by NASA's [[Launch Services Program]]. ''InSight'' was originally scheduled for launch on 4 March 2016 on an [[Atlas V]] 401 (4 meter fairing/zero (0) [[solid rocket booster]]s/single (1) engine [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]]) from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in California, U.S.,&lt;ref name="nasa20131219"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2013/december/nasa-awards-launch-services-contract-for-insight-mission/ |title=NASA Awards Launch Services Contract for InSight Mission |publisher=NASA |date=19 December 2013 |access-date=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was called off in December 2015 due to a vacuum leak on the SEIS instrument.&lt;ref name="AP-20151222"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20151222/us-sci--mars_lander-de6da5a926.html |title=NASA calls off next Mars mission because of instrument leak |work=Excite News |agency=Associated Press |date=22 December 2015 |access-date=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20151222"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/science/space/leaks-in-instrument-force-nasa-to-delay-mars-mission-until-2018.html |title=Leaks in Instrument Force NASA to Delay Mars Mission Until 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |date=22 December 2015 |access-date=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20151222"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4805 |title=NASA Suspends 2016 Launch of InSight Mission to Mars |publisher=NASA |last1=Brown |first1=Dwayne |last2=Cantillo |first2=Laurie |last3=Webster |first3=Guy |last4=Watelet |first4=Julien |date=22 December 2015 |access-date=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rescheduled launch window ran from 5 May to 8 June 2018.

The journey to Mars took 6.5 months across {{convert|301|e6mi|e6km|order=flip|abbr=unit}} for a touchdown on 26 November.&lt;ref name="NYT-20180505" /&gt;&lt;ref name="insight-launch" /&gt; After a successful landing, a three-month-long deployment phase commenced as part of its two-year (about one [[Timekeeping on Mars#Martian year|Martian year]]) prime mission.&lt;ref name="SurfaceOps" /&gt;&lt;ref name="21Nov2018" /&gt;

== Landing site ==
As ''InSight''{{'s}} science goals are not related to any particular surface feature of Mars, potential landing sites were chosen on the basis of practicality. Candidate sites needed to be near the [[equator]] of Mars to provide sufficient sunlight for the solar panels year round, have a low elevation to allow for sufficient atmospheric braking during [[Entry, descent and landing|EDL]], flat, relatively rock-free to reduce the probability of complications during landing, and soft enough terrain to allow the heat flow probe to penetrate well into the ground.

An optimal area that meets all these requirements is [[Elysium Planitia]], so all 22 initial potential landing sites were located in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/sciencefair/2013/09/04/mars-boring-landing/2764137/ |title=NASA searches for (literally) boring Mars landing site |work=[[USA Today]] |last=Vergano |first=Dan |date=4 September 2013 |access-date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only two other areas on the equator and at low elevation, [[Isidis Planitia]] and [[Valles Marineris]], are too rocky. In addition, Valles Marineris has too steep a gradient to allow safe landing.&lt;ref name=landing&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/insight/news/insight20130904.html |title=NASA Evaluates Four Candidate Sites for 2016 Mars Mission |publisher=NASA |date=4 September 2013 |access-date=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2013, the initial 22 potential landing sites were narrowed down to 4, and the ''[[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]'' was then used to gain more information on each of the 4 potential sites before a final decision was made.&lt;ref name=landing /&gt;&lt;ref name="Trget NBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/nasa-picks-prime-target-2016-insight-mars-lander-n317631 |title=NASA Picks Prime Target for 2016 InSight Mars Lander |work=NBC News |last=Boyle |first=Alan |date=5 March 2015 |access-date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each site consists of a [[landing footprint|landing ellipse]] that measures about {{convert|130|by|27|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/28793-nasa-insight-mars-lander-landing-site.html |title=NASA Eyeing Landing Site for 2016 Mars Mission |work=Space.com |last=Wall |first=Mike |date=11 March 2015 |access-date=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, scientists from the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] announced that the landing site had been selected. It is located in western Elysium Planitia at {{Coord|4.5|N|135.9|E|globe:mars_type:landmark|name=''InSight'' landing site}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= |title=Selection of the 2018 Insight Landing Site |conference=48th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. 20–24 March 2017.

{{Unreferenced|date=May 2012}}

The process of '''informational listening''' focuses on the ability of an individual to understand a speaker's [[message]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} It is a huge part of everyday life, and failing to understand the concept of informational listening can be very detrimental to one's [[quality of life]] and to their contribution to society.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Much of the listening people engage in on a regular basis falls under the blanket of listening for information. In the office, people listen to their superiors for instructions about what they are to do. At school, students listen to teachers for information that they are expected to understand for  quizzes and tests. In all areas of life, informational listening plays a huge role in [[human communication]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Potential hindrances==
When listening to a person's message, it is common to overlook aspects of the conversation or make judgments before all of the information is presented.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This lack of effective [[Understanding|comprehension]] is detrimental to [[communication]] and is illustrated effectively by several specific obstacles. Chief among these obstacles are [[confirmation bias]]{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} and the vividness effect,{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} both of which distort the speaker's message by severely affecting the perception of a particular topic.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Confirmation bias===
Confirmation bias is the tendency to pick out aspects of a conversation that support one's own beliefs and values. This psychological process proves to have a detrimental effect on communication for several reasons. 

First, confirmation bias tends to become involved in conversation before the speaker finishes his/her message.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} As a result, an opinion is formed without first obtaining all pertinent information.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This, in turn, leads to uneducated thinking and fallacious judgments that could later affect others.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} 

Second, confirmation bias detracts from a person's ability to be [[Open-mindedness|open-minded]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} For example, when listening to a statement, an individual may hear something at the beginning of the conversation that arouses a specific emotion. Whether this is anger or frustration or anything else, it could have a profound impact on that person's perception of the rest of the conversation.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} If they were to become angry about a statement the speaker made early in the conversation, they would likely be averse to accepting arguments presented later in the [[discourse]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} 

To combat this bias and its consequences, an individual must be aware of it and its effects.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} With this knowledge, an individual can learn to critically judge both sides of an argument before coming to a conclusion.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Vividness effect===
The vividness effect explains how vivid or highly graphic and dramatic events affect an individual's perception of a situation.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This phenomenon has been amplified by the media in recent decades.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} With the use of media technology, graphic images can be used to portray an event. While this makes the process of receiving news easier and more enjoyable, it can also blow a situation out of proportion.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} One year after the [[Columbine High School massacre]], about 60 percent of the people who responded to a survey by ''[[USA Weekend]]'' said that they felt a shooting was likely at their own school.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The reality was much different; in fact, the likelihood of a [[school shooting]] is negligible{{clarify|date=November 2014}} across America.

The vividness effect was only amplified by the media.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} It existed long before the advent of television or radio. When observing an event in person, an individual is automatically drawn toward the sensational or vivid aspects.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Thus, a person becomes quick to believe that all aspects of an event are bad if they only remember the vivid parts that offended them.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} To counter this, an individual must be aware of and deal with the inclination to the dramatic and offensive, act accordingly.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} One must resist the temptation to jump to conclusions and instead weigh all facts before judging.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Effective listening==
In addition to avoiding the two major mistakes listed above, there are things one must do to be a competent informational listener.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Memory===

To understand what is said in the present, one must remember what has been said before; and for the message to have impact, one must remember at least parts of it at some point in the future. The most obvious memory aid is simply taking notes, but it is also helpful to create a mental outline of the message as it is being heard.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Identification===

Identify the main point that the speaker is trying to bring across. When the main point has been deduced, one can begin to sort out the rest of the information and decide where it belongs in the mental outline.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}  Before getting the big picture of a message, it can be difficult to focus on what the speaker is saying, because it is impossible to know where any particular piece of information fits.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Questions===

It is usually helpful to ask oneself questions about the speaker's message.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} If the listener is mentally asking questions about what is being said, it is a good sign that he/she is actively involved in effective informational listening.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9448">'''Irving Jacob Reuter''' (1885–1972) was an automotive leader in the early 1900s. In 1925 he was named [[general manager]] and [[president]] of [[Oldsmobile]] after rising through the ranks at [[Remy Electric]] and then [[General Motors]] after the two companies merged in 1918.

He was from [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], where he met and married Janet (or Jeannette) Reuter née Graham{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} on Feb. 24, 1909.,&lt;ref name="asheville.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asheville.com/news/aso0606.html|title=The Asheville Symphony Receives a Grant from the Janirve Foundation |work=[[Asheville Citizen-Times|Asheville News]] |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNC Asheville"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toto.lib.unca.edu/findingaids/mss/reuter_irving_janet/default_reuter.htm|title=Janet and Irving Reuter Collection, UNC Asheville |publisher=University of North Carolina |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irving Reuter graduated with an engineering degree in 1907 from [[Purdue University College of Engineering]]. His knowledge of the automobile industry was reflected both in managerial duties, and by the six patents he obtained. They include inventions related to such developments as an electric generator, an ignition apparatus, a system for supplying electricity, an ignition coil, a roadster rear seat, and an engine starting device.

In 1922 he was one of ten original investors in General Motors Investment Corporation. That corporation was said to have rejuvenated the finances of the automobile industry.&lt;ref name="oldcarandtruckpictures.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldcarandtruckpictures.com/Buick/buick1960-1970.html|title=The History of Buick |work=The Buick from 1960 to 1976 Wouldn't you Really Rather Have a Buick? |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reuter retired from General Motors in 1935 at the age of 50 and after retirement, he and his wife lived in various locations in Florida and [[Asheville, North Carolina]], where they moved in 1937.

==Medovue Estate==
In 1927 at [[Eaton Rapids, Michigan]], Reuter and his wife, Janet (née Graham) Reuter (1886–1984), built a lavish country home they called [[Medovue]]. From 1928 to 1936, prominent members of American business and automotive companies were their guests at social functions. They were listed both in [[Who's Who in America]] and [[Who's Who in Michigan]] during their Medovue residency. In 1936 he abruptly left his position at Oldsmobile and retired to Florida, although they evidently moved on to North Carolina.

The home was built by the Reniger Construction Co. of Lansing in about a year from a "countryhouse" plan created by architect Harold Childs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kevinforsyth.net/ELMI/childs.htm|title=H. A. Childs House, 343 M.A.C. Ave. (1911) |work=A brief history of East Lansing, Michigan |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of East Lansing.&lt;ref name="English Inn history page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englishinn.com/history.shtml|title=English Inn history |publisher=The English Inn |accessdate=March 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The home includes large expanses of [[Pewabic Pottery]], and the grand (and for the time technologically advanced) main bathroom is a festive work of decorative arts. Also credited is architect, Kenneth Black, who in 1930 added a rear wing and bedroom space for family member Pearl Graham (Janet's sister) of whom Janet was very close to.&lt;ref name="objects"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcgi.state.mi.us/hso/sites/4488.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606141914/http://www.mcgi.state.mi.us/hso/sites/4488.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-06-06|title=State of Michigan statement of historical significance, Meadowvue Estate.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter, the home was owned by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lansing]] from 1940 to 1962, and [[Joseph H. Albers]], first [[Bishop]] of the [[diocese]], used the home as his private residence.&lt;ref name="objects"/&gt; In 1989, the house was renovated and converted into a conference center, and in 1991 was declared a [[Michigan State Historic Preservation Office|Michigan State Historical Object]] (Registered Site L1824, erected 1992 at 677 S. Michigan Road, Eaton Rapids, Michigan.)&lt;ref name="English Inn history page"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michmarkers.com/menus/ID.htm|title=Michigan historical markers list, Irving Reuter.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meadovue's {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} building and grounds are now devoted to a bed and breakfast and a restaurant for fine dining. Many of the furnishing are original antiques, and the site is an important tourist destination in Eaton Rapids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/finance/941168-1.html|title=Whittington, Jane, ''Small Inn Benefits from Big Vision'', Greater Lansing Business Monthly, May 1, 2005.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|15|acre|m2|sing=on}} estate includes the original [[pergola]], nature trails, [[artesian well]], annual and perennial gardens.&lt;ref name="objects"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.org/property/english-inn-restaurant-and-pub|title=The English Inn, Restaurant and Pub |publisher=[[Pure Michigan]]|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Irving Reuter died at his home in Asheville in 1972 at the age of 87. He is interred at [[Crown Hill Cemetery]] in [[Indianapolis]].&lt;ref name="Crown Hill Autos"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.crownhillhf.org/docs/IndianapolisAutoGreatsHandout.pdf |title=Indianapolis Auto greats |publisher=[[Crown Hill Cemetery]] |work=Celebrating Automotive Heritage at Crown Hill Cemetery |year=2011 |accessdate=2012-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913203018/http://crownhillhf.org/docs/IndianapolisAutoGreatsHandout.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Janet Reuter died at the age of 98 in 1984.&lt;ref name="oldcarandtruckpictures.com"/&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Irving Reuter established the Janirve [[Charitable organization|Foundation]] in 1954. The name "Janirve" is a neonym/[[Portmanteau|portmmanteau]] derived from the names of Jeanette and Irving. Much of his estate was transferred to the Janirve Foundation following the death of his wife Jeanett in 1984 The foundation was to have a limited life, and thus has been the source of a protracted legal wrangle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117677618145972189|title=Beatty, Sally, ''Families Wrestle With Closing Foundations'', Wall Street Journal, April 27, 2007. | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=April 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One source noted that from 1984 to 2002, the Janirve [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|Foundation]] distributed $59,863,536 in 1388 grants.&lt;ref name="oldcarandtruckpictures.com"/&gt; Another source reported that: "In 1984, the foundation became involved in grant making, and since that time has issued 1,612 grants totaling $78,897,103. In 2005, there were 78 organizations that received grants in nine different categories that include Arts and Culture, Children and Youth, Community Projects, Education, Environment, Healthcare and Shelter, Social Services, and Miscellaneous. The total amount of funds issued in 2005 equal $5,521,800."&lt;ref name="asheville.com"/&gt;

Through the foundation, the Reuters made large philanthropic gifts to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] at [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unca.edu/alumniandfriends/initiatives.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011031140110/http://www.unca.edu/alumniandfriends/initiatives.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-10-31 |title=Alumni and Friends |publisher=University of North Carolina at Asheville |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;' The Reuter Center is part of the Center for Creative Retirement, and they funded much of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unca.edu/ncccr/Reuter/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011122001129/http://www.unca.edu/ncccr/Reuter/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-11-22 |title=University of North Carolina, Center for Creative Retirement. |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reuters also donated large sums to [[Habitat for Humanity]]. A $2 million matching grant to the west North Carolina [[Young Men's Christian Association]] was the largest donation in the organization's history (the building is named in their honor). They also donated to many other [[Asheville, North Carolina]] charitable and civic organizations, such as the [[Asheville Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref name="asheville.com"/&gt;

The Janirve Foundation Advisory Committee Members: Richard B. Wynne, Vice Chairman; E. Charles Dyson, Chairman Met R. Poston, Committee Member; John W. Erichson, Secretary; and James W. Wollcott, Committee Member.&lt;ref name="oldcarandtruckpictures.com"/&gt;

In [[crystallography]] crystals are described as '''isomorphous ''' if they are closely similar in shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells|first=A.F.|title=Structural Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=1984|edition=5th|isbn=0-19-855370-6  }} pp 186&amp;ndash;186 in 3rd. edition&lt;/ref&gt; Historically crystal shape was defined by measuring the angles between crystal faces with a [[goniometer]]. In modern usage isomorphous crystals belong to the same [[space group]].

[[Double salt|Double sulfate]]s, such as [[Tutton's salt]], with the generic formula M&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, where M&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; is an alkali metal and M&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; is a divalent ion of [[Magnesium|Mg]], [[Manganese|Mn]], [[Iron|Fe]], [[Cobalt|Co]], [[Nickel|Ni]], [[Copper|Cu]] or [[Zinc|Zn]], form a series of isomorphous compounds which were important in the nineteenth century in establishing the correct [[atomic weight]]s of the transition elements. [[Alum]]s, such as KAl(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.12H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, are another series of isomorphous compounds, though there are three series of alums with similar external structures, but slightly different internal structures. Many [[spinel]]s are also isomorphous.

In order to form isomorphous crystals two substances must have the same chemical formulation, they must contain atoms which have corresponding chemical properties and the sizes of corresponding atoms should be similar. These requirements ensure that the forces within and between molecules and ions are approximately similar and result in crystals that have the same internal structure. Even though the space group is the same, the [[unit cell]] dimensions will be slightly different because of the different sizes of the atoms involved.

'''Joseph Albert Walker''' (February 20, 1921 – June 8, 1966) flew the world's first two [[spaceplane]] flights in 1963, thereby becoming the United States' seventh man in space. Walker was a [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] in the [[United States Air Force]], an American [[World War II]] pilot, an [[experimental physicist]], a [[NASA]] [[test pilot]], and a member of the U.S. Air Force [[Man In Space Soonest]] spaceflight program. His two [[X-15]] [[Rocket plane|experimental rocket aircraft]] flights in 1963 that exceeded the [[Kármán line]]&amp;nbsp;– the altitude of {{convert|100|km|abbr=off}}, generally considered to mark the threshold of [[outer space]]&amp;nbsp;– qualified him as an astronaut under the rules of the U.S. Air Force and the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI).

==Early life==
Born in [[Washington, Pennsylvania]], Walker graduated from [[Trinity High School (Washington, Pennsylvania)|Trinity High School]] in 1938. He earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[physics]] from [[Washington and Jefferson College]] in 1942, before entering the United States Army Air Forces. He was married and had four children.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

==Career==
===Military service===
During World War II, Walker flew the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]] fighter and [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|F-5A Lightning]] photo aircraft (a modified P-38) on weather [[reconnaissance]] flights. Walker earned the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] once, awarded by [[Nathan Farragut Twining|General Nathan Twining]] in July 1944, and the [[Air Medal]] with seven [[oak leaf cluster]]s.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

===Test pilot career===

[[File:Pilot Joe Walker and the X-1A - GPN-2000-000095.jpg|thumb|left|Joe Walker and the X-1]]
[[File:Joe Walker X-1E.jpg|thumb|Walker in his [[pressure suit]]&lt;br&gt;with the [[Bell X-1#X-1E|X-1E]]{{#tag:ref|Walker's X-1E was decorated with [[nose art]] of two dice and the name "Little Joe" (Little Joe being a slang term in the game of craps). Similar artwork reading "Little Joe the II" was applied to his X-15 for record-setting Flight 91. These were two rare cases of research aircraft carrying nose art.|group=N}}]]

After World War II, Walker separated from the Army Air Force and joined the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) [[Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], as an experimental physicist. While in Cleveland, Walker became a test pilot, and he conducted icing research in flight, as well as in the NACA icing wind tunnel.  He transferred to the High-Speed Flight Research Station in [[Edwards, California]], in 1951.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

Walker served for 15 years at the Edwards Flight Research Facility - now called the [[Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center]]. By the mid-1950s, he was a Chief Research Pilot. Walker worked on several pioneering research projects. He flew in three versions of the [[Bell X-1]]: the X-1#2 (two flights, first on 27 August 1951), X-1A (one flight), X-1E (21 flights). When Walker attempted a second flight in the X-1A on 8 August 1955, the rocket aircraft was damaged in an explosion just before being launched from the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|JTB-29A mothership]]. Walker was unhurt, though, and he climbed back into the mothership with the X-1A subsequently jettisoned.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

Other research aircraft that he flew were the [[Douglas Skystreak|Douglas D-558-I Skystreak]] #3 (14 flights), [[Douglas Skyrocket|Douglas D-558-II Skyrocket]] #2 (three flights), D-558-II #3  (two flights), [[Douglas X-3 Stiletto]] (20 flights), [[Northrop X-4 Bantam]] (two flights), and [[Bell X-5]] (78 flights).{{fact|date=September 2017}}

Walker was the chief project pilot for the X-3 program. Walker reportedly considered the X-3 to be the worst airplane that he ever flew. In addition to research aircraft, Walker flew many [[chase plane]]s during test flights of other aircraft, and he also flew in programs that involved the [[North American F-100 Super Sabre]], [[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo]], [[Convair F-102 Delta Dagger]], [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] and [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]].{{fact|date=September 2017}}

====X-15 program====
[[File:Joe Walker beside an X-15 Airplane - GPN-2002-000012.jpg|thumb|right|Joe Walker with the X-15]]

{{Main|North American X-15}}
In 1958, Walker was one of the pilots selected for the U.S. Air Force's [[Man In Space Soonest]] (MISS) project, but that project never came to fruition. That same year, NACA became the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and in 1960, Walker became the first NASA pilot to fly the X-15, and the second X-15 pilot, following [[Scott Crossfield]], the manufacturer's test pilot. On his first X-15 flight, Walker did not realize how much power its rocket engines had, and he was crushed backward into the pilot's seat, screaming, "Oh, my God!". Then, a flight controller jokingly replied "Yes? You called?" Walker would go on to fly the X-15 24 times, including the only two flights that exceeded {{convert|100|km|abbr=off}} in altitude, [[X-15 Flight 90|Flight 90]] (on 19 July 1963: {{convert|106|km|abbr=on}}) and [[X-15 Flight 91|Flight 91]] (on 22 August 1963: {{convert|108|km|abbr=on}}).

Walker was the first American civilian to make any spaceflight,&lt;ref name="Space.com Joseph A Walker"&gt;[http://www.space.com/adastra/adastra_joewalker_061127.html " Joseph A Walker."] ''Space.com.'' Retrieved: 8 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and the second civilian overall, preceded only by the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[cosmonaut]], [[Valentina Tereshkova]]&lt;ref name="Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova"&gt;[http://www.adm.yar.ru/english/section.aspx?section_id=74 "Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423074712/http://www.adm.yar.ru/english/section.aspx?section_id=74 |date=23 April 2011 }} ''adm.yar.ru.'' Retrieved: 8 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; one month earlier. Flights 90 and 91 made Walker the first human to make multiple spaceflights.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

Walker flew at the fastest speed in the X-15A-1: {{convert|4,104|mph|abbr=on}} ([[Mach number|Mach]] 5.92) during a flight on 27 June 1962 (the fastest flight in any of the three X-15s was about {{convert|4,520|mph|0|abbr=on}} (Mach 6.7) flown by [[William J. Knight]] in 1967).{{fact|date=September 2017}}

====LLRV program====
{{Main|Lunar Landing Research Vehicle}}
Walker also became the first test pilot of the Bell [[Lunar Landing Research Vehicle]] (LLRV), which was used to develop piloting and operational techniques for lunar landings. On 30 October 1964, Walker took the LLRV on its maiden flight, reaching an altitude of about 10&amp;nbsp;ft and a total flight time of just under one minute. He piloted 35 LLRV flights in total. [[Neil Armstrong]] later flew this craft many times in preparation for the [[spaceflight]] of [[Apollo 11]] - the first manned landing on the Moon - including crashing it once and barely escaping from it with his ejection seat.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

==Death==

Walker was killed on June 8, 1966, when his [[F-104 Starfighter]] chase aircraft collided with a [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie]].&lt;ref name=xb70aincoll&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XHZQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DhEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5942%2C1339734 "XB-70A in collision, 2 die."] ''Milwaukee Sentinel'', June 9, 1966, p. 1-part 1.&lt;/ref&gt; At an altitude of about {{convert|25000|ft|km|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=ibixb&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zEQaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zScEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7224%2C5027111 "Inquiry begins into XB-70A collision."] ''Milwaukee Journal'', 9 June 1966, p. 12-part 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Walker's Starfighter was one of five aircraft in a tight group formation for a [[General Electric]] publicity photo when his F-104 drifted into contact with the XB-70's right wingtip. The F-104 flipped over, and, rolling inverted, passed over the top of the XB-70, striking both its vertical stabilizers and its left wing in the process, and exploded, killing Walker.{{#tag:ref|The famous test pilot [[Chuck Yeager]] expressed his personal opinion that Walker's inexperience at formation flying was to blame, although no specific cause was ever determined in the subsequent accident investigation.&lt;ref name="yeagerbio"&gt;Yeager and Janos 1986, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}}  The Valkyrie entered an uncontrollable spin and crashed into the ground north of Barstow, California, killing co-pilot Carl Cross. Its pilot, [[Alvin S. White|Alvin White]], one of Walker's colleagues from the Man In Space Soonest program, ejected and was a sole survivor.

The USAF summary report of the accident investigation stated that, given the position of the F-104 relative to the XB-70, the F-104 pilot would not have been able to see the XB-70's wing, except by uncomfortably looking back over his left shoulder. The report stated that it was likely that Walker, piloting the F-104, maintained his position by looking at the fuselage of the XB-70, forward of his position.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

The F-104 was estimated to be {{convert|70|ft|-1|abbr=on}} to the side of, and {{convert|10|ft|0|abbr=on}} below, the fuselage of the XB-70. The report concluded that from that position, without appropriate sight cues, Walker was unable to properly perceive his motion relative to the Valkyrie, leading to his aircraft drifting into contact with the XB-70's wing.&lt;ref name=Jenk_Land_p60&gt;Jenkins and Landis 2002, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=accident_report&gt;''Summary Report: XB-70 Accident Investigation''. USAF,  1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

The accident investigation also pointed to the wake vortex off the XB-70's right wingtip as the reason for the F-104's sudden roll over and into the bomber.&lt;ref name=accident_report/&gt; A sixth plane in the incident was a civilian [[Learjet 23]] that held the photographer. Because the formation flight and photo were unauthorized, the careers of several Air Force colonels ended as a result of this aviation accident.&lt;ref name=cffstr&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RhdZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TOEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6826%2C3497703 "Colonel fired for stunt role."] ''Eugene Register-Guard'', 6 August 1966. p. 4A.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clpoxb &gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=G24dAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G5sEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4172%2C2392386 "Colonel loses post over XB-70 crash."] ''Tuscaloosa News'', 16 August 1966, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/XB-70_crash_site.htm "The Crash of the XB-70."] ''Check-Six.com.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2456">The '''Library and Information Science Abstracts''' ('''LISA''') is an international abstracting and indexing tool designed for library professionals and other information specialists. LISA covers the literature in [[Library and information science]] (LIS) since 1969 and currently abstracts 440+ periodicals from 68+ countries and in 20+ languages.

==Coverage==
Meho &amp; Spurgin (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Meho, Lokman I. &amp; Spurgin, Kristina M. (2005). Ranking the Research Productivity of Library and Information Science Faculty and Schools: An Evaluation of Data Sources and Research Methods. ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'', 56(12), 1314–1331.&lt;/ref&gt; found that in a list of 2,625 items published between 1982 and 2002 by 68 faculty members of 18 schools of [[library and information science]], only 10 databases provided significant coverage of the LIS literature. Data showed that [[Library Literature and Information Science]] (LLIS) indexes the highest percentage of LIS faculty publications (31.2%), followed by [[INSPEC]] (30.6%), [[Social Sciences Citation Index]] (SSCI)(29.6%), and LISA (27.2%). LISA is thus the fourth most comprehensive in this study.

This is a '''list of [[German language|German-language]] [[philosopher]]s'''.  The following [[individuals]] have written [[philosophical]] texts in the [[German language]]. Many are categorized as [[:Category:German philosophers|German philosophers]] or [[:Category:Austrian philosophers|Austrian philosophers]], but some are neither [[Germans|German]] nor [[Austria]]n by [[ethnicity]] or [[nationality]]. Each one, however, satisfies at least one of the following criteria:

# s/he has been identified as a philosopher in any reputable, reliable encyclopedic/scholarly publication (e.g. MacMillan, Stanford, Routledge, Oxford, Metzler.)''
# s/he has written multiple articles published in reputable, reliable journals of philosophy and/or written books that were reviewed in such journals.

This list represents a full overview about notable [[Tunisia|Tunisian Scientists]] who had appeared since the creation of Tunisia as a distinct political entity under the [[Ottoman Tunisia|Ottoman influence]] in the 16th century.

==Ottoman Period (1574-1881)==
When the Ottoman Empire had occupied Tunisia, the Scientific Deterioration of Tunisia has not been efficiently inhibited. The unique institution that had contributed to avoid a catastrophic situation for the common knowledge in Tunisia is the [[Université Zitouna|Zitouna University]] that had developed during successive Ottoman periods and that gives courses which are specialized in [[Social science]]s and [[Humanities]] like [[Theology]], [[Fiqh]], [[Hadith]], [[Arabic language]], [[Arabic literature]], [[Law]] and a few [[Arithmetics]] and [[calculus]]. This situation explains why all important scientists of that period were [[lawyer]]s, [[poet]]s, [[author]]s and [[Islamic theology|theologists]].

During the crisis of the 19th century that had occurred in Tunisia, some notable intellectual people who had deeper training and education had appeared like [[General Hussein]] and [[Kheireddine Pacha]] thanks to their specialized studies in the [[Military school of Bardo]] that had been created in order to solve the matter of the lack of experts in applied sciences caused by the deficiency of the system of [[Université Zitouna|Zitouna University]]. Those people had tried to do some reforms in order to save the country. Even the alumni of [[Université Zitouna|Zitouna University]] had tried to do some works in order to better the scientific consciousness in Tunisia. In fact, some main scientific works of that period that were led by the [[Bayram Family|Bayram]], [[Ben Achour Family|Ben Achour]], [[Ennaifar Family|Ennaifar]] and [[Djait Family|Djait]] families had been done. These works were important and were considered as promoters of an [[Arab Renaissance]]. However, these performances were not very fructuous as the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]] has been installed in April 1881.

This is a '''list of early microcomputers''' sold to hobbyists and developers. These [[microcomputer]]s were often sold as "[[Do it yourself|DIY]]" kits or pre-built machines in relatively small numbers in the mid-1970s.  These systems were primarily used for teaching the use of [[microprocessor]]s and supporting peripheral devices, and unlike [[home computers]] were rarely used with pre-written application software. Most early micros came without alphanumeric keyboards or displays, which had to be provided by the user. [[Random-access memory|RAM]] was quite small in the unexpanded systems (a few hundred bytes to a few kilobytes). By 1976 the number of pre-assembled machines was growing, and the 1977 introduction of the "Trinity" of [[Commodore PET]], [[TRS-80]] and [[Apple II]] generally marks the end of the "early" microcomputer era, and the advent of the consumer [[home computer]] era that followed.

==Discrete logic==
Before the advent of microprocessors, it was possible to build small computers using small-scale [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs), where each IC contained only a few logic gates or flip-flops.
* The [[Kenbak-1]] (1971) used [[small scale integration]] [[transistor-transistor logic]] (TTL) ICs and had 256 bytes of memory.  It was priced at USD 750 and sold only 40 units.&lt;ref&gt;p. 4/3, ''A history of the personal computer: the people and the technology'', Roy A. Allan, 2001, {{ISBN|0-9689108-0-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Datapoint 2200]] (shipped 1971) was the first machine ''designed'' to use a microprocessor, but when Intel could not deliver the 8008 in time, they released the machine using discrete logic.
* The [[Educ-8]] (1975) was an [[Electronics Australia]] magazine project describing a computer built from TTL ICs.

==Test and development machines==
As microprocessors were developed, companies often released simple development systems to bootstrap the use of the processor. These systems were often converted by hobbyists into complete computer systems.

Intel's [[Intellec]] computers were a series of early [[microcomputer]]s [[Intel]] produced starting in the 1970s as a development platform for their processors.

==Kits==
For some time the microcomputer world was dominated by systems delivered in [[Electronic kit|kit]] form. As most machines of the era were sold in small numbers, there was no reason to invest in automated manufacturing systems, leaving the final assembly to manual labor. Kits took advantage of this by offering the system at a low price point, and relying on the user to complete the expensive part, the final assembly. Kits were popular between 1975, with the introduction of the famous Altair 8800, but as sales volumes increased, kits became less common. The introduction of useful fully assembled machines in 1977 led to the rapid disappearance of kit systems for most users. The famed [[ZX81]] is among the last of the large sellers in the kit market.

Some magazines published plans and printed circuit board layouts from which a reader could in principle duplicate the project, although usually commercially made boards could be ordered to expedite assembly. Other kits varied from etched, drilled, printed circuit boards and a parts list to packages containing cases, power supplies, and all interconnections.  All kits required significant assembly by the user.

==Complete microcomputers==
A number of complete microcomputers were offered even before kits became popular, dating to as far back as 1973. For some time there was a major market for assembled versions of the Altair 8800, a market that grew significantly through the late 1970s and into the early 1980s. The introduction of three computers aimed at personal users in 1977, the [[Radio Shack TRS-80]], [[Apple II]], and [[Commodore PET]], significantly changed the market and led to the [[home computer]] revolution.

* [[MicroSystems International]]'s CPS-1, using a locally produced microprocessor based on the design of the [[Intel 4004]]. First built in 1972, a small number shipped in early 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Zbigniew Stachniak, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5255182 "The MIL MF7114 Microprocessor"], ''IEEE Annals of Computer History'', 22 September 2009, pg. 48-59&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Micral|Micral N]] (1973) was the earliest commercial, non-kit personal computer based on a microprocessor (the [[Intel 8008]])&lt;ref name="Computer History Museum"&gt;Computer History Museum&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sord Computer Corporation]]'s SMP80/08, based on the [[Intel 8008]], debuted in early 1973. It was followed by the SMP80/x, debuted in May 1974, which used the [[Intel 8080]].&lt;ref&gt;http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/personal/0086.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[MCM/70]] was a 1974 Intel 8008-based design, primarily designed to run [[APL (programming language)|APL]]. According to the IEEE Annals of Computer History, the MCM/70 is the earliest commercial, non-kit personal computer.&lt;ref&gt;Zbigniew Stachniak. "The Making of the MCM/70 Microcomputer". ''IEEE Annals of the History of Computing'', 2003: pg. 62-75&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[IBM 5100]] was possibly the first portable microcomputer. Most people think the famous IBM PC (the 5150) was IBM's first micro but there were a number of microcomputer models released by IBM from 1975.
* [[Processor Technology]]'s Sol-20, offered both as kit and assembled, but the vast majority were sold assembled
* [[ECD Micromind]], introduced 1977 [[MOS Technology|MOS Technology 6512]] (6502 w/ external clock). Prototypes only.
* [[MPT8080]] Microtutor, an Intel 8080–based microprocessor trainer introduced 1977.  As recently as 2008, it remained in academic use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual

The observation of the Lynx Supercluster has allowed other locations in proximity to be found. These locations are of special interest because of their high density, which has turned into the discovery of the seven smaller groups of galaxies mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakata|first=F.|last2=Kodama|first2=T.|last3=Shimasaku|first3=K.|last4=Doi|first4=M.|last5=Furusawa|first5=H.|last6=Hamabe|first6=M.|last7=Kimura|first7=M.|last8=Komiyama|first8=Y.|last9=Miyazaki|first9=S.|date=2005-03-11|title=Discovery of a large-scale clumpy structure around the Lynx supercluster at z   1.27|url=https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/357/4/1357/1054896|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|language=en|volume=357|issue=4|pages=1357–1362|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.08756.x|issn=0035-8711|arxiv=astro-ph/0412460|bibcode=2005MNRAS.357.1357N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study has been conducted between the clusters in the Lynx, to examine and compare their color and shift.

The '''M4''' is a [[motorway]] in the [[United Kingdom]] running from West [[London]] to [[South Wales]]. Towns and cities along the route include [[Slough]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Swindon]], [[Bristol]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Cardiff]] and [[Swansea]]. Originally referred to as the London-South Wales Motorway, the English section to the [[Severn Bridge]] over the [[River Severn]] was constructed between 1961 and 1971; the Welsh element was completed in 1993. Another Severn bridge, known as the [[Second Severn Crossing]], was opened in 1996 and the M4 was rerouted.

From London to Bristol, the M4 runs close to the [[A4 road (Great Britain)|A4]], and after crossing the River Severn, following the [[A48 road (Great Britain)|A48]] through [[South Wales]], using the [[Brynglas Tunnels]] in Newport, it terminates north of [[Pontarddulais]]. The M4 is one of only three motorways in Wales; the others being the [[A48(M) motorway|A48(M)]] and [[M48 motorway|M48]] [[Spur route|spurs]]. Although not signed, [[European route E30]] includes most of the M4.

==History==
A new road from London to South Wales was first proposed in the 1930s, and the [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]] announced plans for the M4 as one of the first major post-war trunk road improvement projects in 1956.&lt;ref name=J8_J18&gt;{{cite web|title=The M4 London to South Wales Motorway.

The [[Chiswick flyover]], a short section of elevated dual-carriageway built to reduce the impact of traffic travelling between central London and the west, opened in 1959;&lt;ref name="Curtis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/article-23751213-the-sweet-little-chiswick-flyover-hits-50.do |title=The 'sweet little Chiswick Flyover' hits 50 |first=Nick |last=Curtis |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=1 October 2009 |publisher=[[Evening Standard|This Is London]] |accessdate=3 March 2012 |quote=The showbiz opening on 30 September 1959 was therefore a shrewd publicity stunt by Alderton's managing director, J E Dayton.

The [[Maidenhead]] bypass opened in 1961 whilst J1-J5 opened in 1965. The stretch from J18 to the west of Newport was opened in 1966, including the [[Severn Bridge]] (now part of the [[M48 motorway|M48]]). The [[Port Talbot]] by-pass, also built in the 1960s and now part of the M4, was originally the [[A48(M) motorway]], a number now allocated to a short section of motorway near Cardiff. The Ministry of Transport originally intended that the M4 would terminate at [[Tredegar Park]] west of Newport, and it was only following the creation of the [[Welsh Office]] that the Government became committed to a high-standard dual carriageway to [[Pont Abraham]] in [[Carmarthenshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The M4 in Wales|url=http://www.motorwayarchive.ihtservices.co.uk/m4wales.htm|publisher=The Motorway Archive Trust|accessdate=1 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122052452/http://www.motorwayarchive.ihtservices.co.uk/m4wales.htm|archivedate=22 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English section of the motorway was completed on 22 December 1971 when the {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch between Junctions 9 and 15 ([[Maidenhead]] and [[Swindon]]) was opened to traffic.&lt;ref name=Motor197112&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Tony Kyd (Charles Bulmer -Ed) |title = On the road| journal =[[The Motor (magazine)|The Motor]]| volume = nbr 3625| page = Page 30| date = 23 December 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Welsh section was completed in 1993, when the [[Briton Ferry]] motorway bridge opened. The [[Second Severn Crossing]] opened in 1996, together with new link motorways on either side of the estuary to divert the M4 over the new crossing. The existing route over the Severn Bridge was redesignated the M48, and the new [[M49 motorway|M49]] was opened to connect the new crossing to the [[M5 motorway|M5]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m4sscscheme.htm |title=The Motorway Archive: M4 Second Severn Crossing |publisher=Iht.org |date=28 April 1992 |accessdate=31 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207181941/http://www.iht.org/motorway/m4sscscheme.htm |archivedate= 7 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New severn bridge best 750pix.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Second Severn Crossing]]]]
In June 1999 the section of the third lane (the lane nearest the central reservation) between Junctions 2 and 3 was converted to a [[M4 bus lane|bus lane]], first as a pilot scheme and then permanently in 2001. A lower speed limit was introduced along the bus lane section at the same time&lt;ref name=bbc2001&gt;{{cite news|title=Does this look like a U-turn?|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1119193.stm | date=18 January 2001 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the lane was however reverted to general traffic use by the incoming coalition government in late 2010).&lt;ref name=buslaneremoval/&gt;

In April 2005 speed checks carried out by [[Mobile speed camera|police camera vans]] between Junction 14 and Junction 18 led to a public protest, involving a "go-slow" of several hundred vehicles along the affected sections of the motorway.&lt;ref name="m4protest"&gt;{{cite news

Between 2007 and January 2010 the section from [[Castleton, Newport|Castleton]] (Junction 29) to [[Coryton, Cardiff|Coryton]] (Junction 32) was widened to six lanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.m4widening29to32.com/overview.htm  |title=: : M4 Motorway Widening : : |publisher=web.archive.org |accessdate=20 November 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080115074004/http://www.m4widening29to32.com/overview.htm |archivedate = 15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was formally opened on 25 January 2010 by [[Ieuan Wyn Jones]] the [[Deputy First Minister for Wales]].

During 2009 the Newport section of the motorway between Junctions 23a and 29 was upgraded with a new concrete central barrier. In February 2010 it was proposed that the M4 in South Wales would become the first [[hydrogen highway]] with [[hydrogen station]]s provided along the route, with an aspiration for further stations to be provided along the M4 into [[South West England]] over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8511319.stm|title=M4 in Wales to be 'hydrogen highway,' ministers to say|work=BBC News|date=12 February 2010|accessdate=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar claim was made for a {{Convert|30|mi|adj=on}} section of road in Scotland close to [[Aberdeen]] in September 2009 with refuelling points at Bridge of Don, Ellon and Peterhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/8245093.stm|title='Hydrogen highway' plans backed|work=BBC News|date=8 September 2009|accessdate=12 February 2010|first=Douglas|last=Fraser}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:M4 River Neath Crossing.jpg|thumb|280px|The original (A48(M)) bridge over the [[River Neath]] is to the right, the new M4 bridge is to the left]]
In October 2010 the new [[Secretary of State for Transport]], [[Philip Hammond]], announced that the bus lane in the London section would be suspended for 18 months from 24 December 2010, be brought back into use temporarily for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], and then be removed.&lt;ref name=bbc_scrap&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-11451350|title=Government to scrap M4 bus lane|work=BBC News|date=1 October 2010|accessdate=1 October 2010|quote=The controversial M4 bus lane is due to be scrapped at the end of the year. Under the plans, all motorists will be able to use the {{Convert|3.5|mi}} lane which operates on the London-bound carriageway from near Heathrow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2008 and 2010, Junction 11, near [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], was extensively remodelled with a new four-lane motorway junction, two new road bridges and other works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/19089.aspx|title=M4 Junction 11 Improvement Scheme|publisher=Highways Agency|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626122652/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/19089.aspx|archivedate=26 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The £65m scheme included work on the Mereoak roundabout and part of the A33 Swallowfield Bypass near [[Shinfield]], and also the conversion of the two existing bridges, one of which is available only to pedestrians and cyclists and the other to buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reading.gov.uk/ltp/General.asp?id=SX9452-A7832CD2|title=M4 Junction 11 Improvements|publisher=Reading Borough Council|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713000524/http://www.reading.gov.uk/ltp/General.asp?id=SX9452-A7832CD2|archivedate=13 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also involved the movement of the local [[Highways Agency]] and [[Fire service in the United Kingdom|Fire Service]] offices, and the construction of a long footbridge network, a new [[Bus lane|bus-lane]] and a new [[Gyratory#Gyratory system|gyratory]].

==Features==

===Toll bridge===
[[File:Rogiet MMB 01 M4 Tollbooths.jpg|thumb|The westbound carriageway tolls (left), near [[Rogiet]], and the three-lane eastbound carriageway (right).]]

The M4 crosses the [[River Severn]] on a [[Second Severn Crossing|toll bridge]], the last of two on the UK motorway network. The other being the [[Severn Bridge]]  carrying the [[M48 motorway|M48]]. Tolls are charged travelling only westbound. Drivers therefore have to pay to enter Wales, but not to enter England.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.severnbridge.co.uk/Home.aspx?.Parent=&amp;FileName=toll-price12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speed limits===
For the majority of its length, the [[national speed limit]] applies. Exceptions include the following:
* {{convert|40|mph|km/h}} on the Chiswick Flyover within London in both directions.
* {{convert|60|mph|km/h}} between junction 4 and the Chiswick Flyover eastbound only.
* {{convert|50|mph|km/h}} when approaching the toll plaza after the Severn Crossing.&lt;ref name="ssccameras"&gt;{{cite news

|title=Speed cameras slow bridge traffic
|date=5 October 2004
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{convert|50|mph|km/h}} on the Port Talbot elevated section between junction 40 and junction 41. The fixed speed camera was removed in 2006 as it was believed to be  causing tailbacks. In July 2014, an [[SPECS (speed camera)|average speed camera]] system was installed; it generates around £500,000 in fines each six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Average speed cameras for Port Talbot M4 stretch|publisher=BBC South West Wales|date=14 July 2014|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-28265463|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = M4 speed cameras generate half a million pounds | publisher = [[itv.com]] | date = 2015-06-16 | url = http://www.itv.com/news/wales/update/2015-06-16/m4-speed-cameras-generate-half-a-million-pounds/ | access-date = 2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===M4 bus lane===
[[File:M4 bus lane 1017020.jpg|thumb|M4 bus lane near [[Norwood Green]], [[Ealing]]]]
{{main|M4 bus lane}}
Between 1999 and 2010 there was a controversial {{Convert|3.5|mi|adj=on}} [[bus lane]] on the eastbound (London-bound) carriageway from Junction 3 (A312) to the western end of the Chiswick Flyover near [[Brentford]], covering part of the {{Convert|15|mi|adj=on}} journey between [[Heathrow Airport]] and central London. The lane which had no intermediate exits was for use by buses, coaches, motorcycles, emergency vehicles and licensed taxis but not mini-cabs.&lt;ref name=bbc2009&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/8249919.stm | work=BBC News | title=M4 bus lane is 'barely enforced' | date=11 September 2009 | accessdate=12 May 2010 | first=Tom | last=Edwards}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used by 7% of vehicles which carried 21% of the people.&lt;ref name="bbc2001"/&gt;

The lane was restored for normal motorway running at the end of 2010 for 18 months&lt;ref name=buslaneremoval&gt;{{cite news |title=Stretch of M4 bus lane opens to all motorists |date=16 November 2010 |publisher=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-11763882 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; using an Experimental Traffic Order&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/news/pressrelease.aspx?pressreleaseid=416512|title=Work starts to remove M4 Bus Lane|publisher=Highways Agency|quote=The suspension of the M4 Bus Lane is being carried out under an Experimental Order under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707142823/http://www.highways.gov.uk/news/pressrelease.aspx?pressreleaseid=416512|archivedate=7 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was re-established for the duration of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] with the intention that it would then be removed permanently.&lt;ref name=buslaneremoval/&gt;

===Porous road surface===
Near Junction 35 of the M4, there is a stretch of the motorway that has a surfacing of porous [[asphalt concrete|asphalt]] that improves drainage and reduces noise.  When driving in heavy rain drivers notice a reduction in [[road spray]] from other vehicles and improved visibility. This special surface was publicised in an episode of the BBC's ''[[Tomorrow's World]]'' programme. This was the site of the first trial of the new road surface when it was laid down in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hanson.biz/files/pdf/magazine/2006/2006Q4_op.pdf |title=2006 Fourth quarter foundation magazine – Operations and products |publisher=Hanson.biz |date=31 May 2011 |accessdate=31 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530154411/http://www.hanson.biz/files/pdf/magazine/2006/2006Q4_op.pdf |archivedate=30 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elevated and heated section===
The elevated section of the M4 in West London, built in the 1960s, is mostly directly above the [[A4 road (Great Britain)|A4]] and extends over parts of [[Brentford]]'s [[Golden Mile (Brentford)|Golden Mile]]. This section was designed to have a heated road surface to reduce icing in winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=One More Link to the West|journal=New Scientist|date=25 March 1965|page=772|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=57SmliUoH-QC&amp;pg=PA772&amp;lpg=PA772&amp;dq=M4+motorway+London+heated+surface&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mz-uYofLct&amp;sig=V5khEHXPgNcj1y8u4Pg6F9ai2l4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAjgKahUKEwjulc__hvDIAhWGNT4KHfLiAcI#v=onepage&amp;q=M4%20motorway%20London%20heated%20surface&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Thornes |first=John Edward |date=1984 |title=The Prediction of Ice Formation on Motorways in Britain |type=Ph.

===Four level stack interchanges===
[[File:M4 M25 junction.jpg|thumb|M4 Junction 4b / M25 Junction 15 near [[Heathrow Airport]]]]

The M4 has two of the three four-level [[stack interchange]]s in the UK, including the first UK example at junction 20, the "[[Almondsbury Interchange]]" with the M5, The other is junction 4b with the M25. Junction 4b has to make provision for the railway line passing beneath the M4. Due to the nature of these junctions, it is impossible to make a u-turn at either junction.

===Tunnels===

The M4 passes through the Brynglas Tunnels at Junction 25a, [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]. These are the only twin–bored tunnels on the United Kingdom motorway network.

===Notable junctions===

Junction 8/9 near [[Maidenhead]], [[Berkshire]], and [[High Wycombe]], [[Buckinghamshire]] is the only one in the UK with dual numbers. This a relic from when the M4 used to turn north after junction 8, where it met the A308, and head for the original Junction 9, where it ended on a roundabout interchange with the [[A4 road (England)|A4]]. When the westward extension was opened junction 8 was closed and a new junction built a little to the west, taking both numbers. The road to the A4 became A423(M) and later [[A404(M) motorway|A404(M)]] and the junction with the A4 became 9B. Junction 9A is the exit for [[Cox Green, Berkshire|Cox Green]] and [[White Waltham]]. West of Junction 13 on the eastbound carriageway there are a set of sliproads signposted "Works Unit Only". The signs have red borders, implying a military exit. It is a back entrance to [[RAF Welford]], a Second World War airfield and now an RAF/[[United States Air Force|USAF]] military installation mainly used for storing munitions. The M4 entrance allows easier access for the large vehicles used to carry the munitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This Sceptred Isle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-11482,00.html|website=Notes and Queries|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The section of the M4 in South Wales has to thread its way through mountainous terrain and built-up areas, so there are some unusual junction layouts. Junction 27 ([[High Cross, Newport|High Cross]]) is a normal grade-separated roundabout junction, but subject to severe space constraints: traffic joining the motorway must initially travel in the opposite direction to the intended direction of travel, before making a sharp left-hand turn from the slip road onto the motorway. At the time of construction, junctions 30 and 31 were set aside for intermediate additional interchanges. Junction 30 ([[Cardiff Gate]]) has since been added but there are no current plans to construct junction 31 ([[A469 road]]). Junction 39 can only be used to access the motorway from a single slip road onto the westbound carriageway from the A48 at junction 38. There is no exit from the motorway at this junction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M4 Exit List|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m4/exitlist|publisher=CBRD|accessdate=14 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125221609/http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m4/exitlist|archivedate=25 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Junction 41 comprises two different junctions; one for local traffic to and from the west and one from the east. The former leads to and from a spur leading to the roundabout in [[Briton Ferry]], formerly known as junction 41a, and the original bridge over the [[River Neath]], which would allow access onto the stretch of the M4 from Junction 43 westward. The second, eastern junction leads to and from the A48 towards [[Port Talbot]]. As a result, it is possible to travel in both directions for almost {{convert|2|mi}} on the motorway, both joining and then leaving the motorway at junction 41. Junction 44 is unusual in that the eastbound entrance dives under the inside of the junction, effectively a creating a "right-turn" on a [[roundabout]]. Similarly, slip roads pass under or over the main motorway at Junctions 41 and 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The M4 Motorway (Junction 41, Westbound Exit Slip Road, Sunnycroft Roundabout, Baglan, Neath Port Talbot) (50 MPH Speed Limit) Regulations 2010|url=http://www.assembly.wales/Laid%20Documents/SUB-LD8271%20-%20The%20M4%20Motorway%20(Junction%2041,%20Westbound%20Exit%20Slip%20Road,%20Sunnycroft%20Roundabout,%20Baglan,%20Neath%20Port%20-28102010-201185/sub-ld8271-e-English.pdf|publisher=Assembly for Wales|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smart motorway==
[[File:Newport M4 junction 27.jpg|thumb|Construction of electronic indicator signs for the [[smart motorway|variable speed limit]] scheme at junction 27 and a new concrete reservation (2010)]]
The M4 motorway has two sections of [[smart motorway]]. The one between junctions 19 (M32) and 20 (M5) north of Bristol has variable speed limits and a part-time hard-shoulder. Completion was in summer 2014. The section between junctions 24 and 29 in Newport has variable speed limits.&lt;ref name="j19-20 atm - ha main"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/23382.aspx|publisher=[[Highways Agency]]|title=M4 J19-20 and M5 J15-17 Managed Motorways|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 it was announced that a smart motorway would be constructed between junctions 3 and 12, with work starting in Autumn 2018. This will be the longest smart motorway scheme in the United Kingdom, with a length of 51km (32 miles). Work is expected to be completed in March 2022 at a cost of £848 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M4 junctions 3 to 12 smart motorway|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/372310/S140566_M4_junction3_to_12_consultation_brochure__for_web_-_final_.pdf|publisher=Highways Agency|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://highwaysengland.co.uk/projects/m4-junctions-3-12-smart-motorway/|title=M4 junctions 3-12: smart motorway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New junctions: 15a, 18a==
A new Junction 15a is being considered{{When|date=November 2018}} by [[Wiltshire Council]], which would give access to South and Central [[Swindon]] as well as to [[Wroughton]], [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] and [[Devizes]] via the existing [[A4361]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} In South Gloucestershire, a possible Junction 18a would connect with the [[A432 road|A432]] and [[A4174]] giving better access to [[Bristol]], via [[Mangotsfield]], and also a direct link with Yate.&lt;ref name="SouthGlosCouncilRoadReport20112012"&gt;{{

==M4 Junction 31==
Plans for the "missing" Junction 31, also known as the [[Thornhill, Cardiff|Thornhill]] [[Interchange (road)|interchange]], for which [[planning permission]] was originally granted in September 1991 (but subsequently expired), were rekindled after proposals for a new business park on a {{convert|125|acre|ha|0}} site north of the M4 were submitted in 2007 to [[Cardiff Council]].&lt;ref name="J31"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/news/cardiff-news/2007/06/23/council-will-look-again-at-case-for-m-way-link-91466-19345314/|publisher=icwales|title=Council will look again at case for M-way link|date=23 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers of the business park, [[St. Modwen Properties|St Modwen Developments]], would likely fund the new junction, which would be on the [[A469 road|A469]].&lt;ref name="J31Dev"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/business-in-wales/business-news/2007/12/19/business-park-plan-would-hit-green-land-91466-20266885/|publisher=icwales|title=Business park plan ‘would hit green land’|date=19 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A freedom of information request in 2010 to Cardiff Council shows that whilst the land that would enable this junction should continue to be strategically protected, the decision to formally abandon the proposed Junction 31 Thornhill was made in October 2007 and there had been no subsequent mention of it in Cardiff Council
Strategic or Planning meetings since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/m4_junction_31|last1=Salmon|first1=Jeff|title=M4 J31 Freedom of information act|website=www.whatdotheyknow.com|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==M4 relief road==
{{main|M4 relief road}}
Plans for an 'M4 Relief Road' around [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] were first announced by the [[Welsh Office]] in 1991, but made little progress. The [[Welsh Assembly Government]] revived the scheme as the [[M4 relief road]] tolled bypass in 2007 but later abandoned it for financial reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/7003690.stm|title=Plans for the M4 Toll (Newport) | work=BBC News | date=20 September 2007 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extension to the Newport [[Southern Distributor Road]] through the old [[Corus Group plc|Corus]] steel works is being considered.&lt;ref name="wag1"&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This road is already a dual carriageway but not open to the public. A public consultation exercise on options for improving the capacity of the [[M4 corridor]] around Newport opened on 5 March 2012.  Its website states that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m4cem.com/overview.html M4 corridor enhancement measures: Overview].  Accessed 5 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; "the motorway around Newport does not conform to today’s motorway standards. It lacks continuous hard shoulders, has closely spaced junctions with sub-standard slip road visibility and narrows to a restricted two lane section through the Brynglas Tunnels. Heavy congestion occurs along this stretch and either side of it at peak hours."

==Port Talbot, Junctions 40 and 41==
There have been calls to close the [[slip road]]s at Junction 40 and 41 (at Port Talbot) to improve traffic flow. The motorway has only two lanes on this stretch and is a major traffic congestion blackspot. Junctions 40 and 41 (at Port Talbot) have very short slip roads which have not been modernised.&lt;ref name="m4junc4041"&gt;{{

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7461">The '''MIRIAM Registry''', a by-product of the [[MIRIAM]] Guidelines, is a database of namespaces and associated information that is used in the creation of [[URI|uniform resource identifiers]]. It contains the set of community-approved namespaces for databases and resources serving, primarily, the biological sciences domain. These shared namespaces, when combined with 'data collection' identifiers, can be used to create globally unique identifiers for knowledge held in data repositories. For more information on the use of URIs to annotate models, see the specification of [http://sbml.org/wiki/ SBML Level 2 Version 2] (and above).

A 'data collection' is defined as a set of data which is generated by a provider. A 'resource' is defined as a distributor of that data. Such a description allows numerous resources to be associated with a single collection, allowing accurate representation of how biological information is available on the World Wide Web; often the same information, from a single data collection, may be mirrored by different resources, or the core information may be supplemented with other data.

The MIRIAM Registry is a curated resource, which is freely available and open to all. Submissions for new collections can be made through the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/miriam/main/mdb?section=submit |title=New Collection Submission page |publisher=Ebi.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identifiers using the MIRIAM system ==

The MIRIAM Guidelines require the use of uniform resource identifiers in the annotation of model components. These are created using the shared list of namespaces defined in the MIRIAM Registry.

===MIRIAM URIs===

Using the namespaces defined in the MIRIAM Registry, it is possible to create identifiers in both a URN and a URL forms. This requires a unique collection-specific identifier, as well as a namespace to globally constrain the information space. Both the namespace and the root of each URI form are given for each data collection in the Registry. It should be noted that both forms are derived from the same namespace. For example:

* urn form: &lt;code&gt;urn:miriam:pubmed:16333295&lt;/code&gt;
* url form: &lt;code&gt;http://identifiers.org/pubmed/16333295&lt;/code&gt;

In this example, the collection-specific identifier is 16333295, and the namespace is pubmed.

The URN form of identifiers requires the use of Web Services or programmatic means to access the referenced record. This means that one cannot simply put the URN form into a browser window and arrive at the referenced information. The URL form is directly resolvable, and relies on a resolving layer provided by [[Identifiers.org]].

===Supporting features and availability===

To enable efficient use of the MIRIAM Registry and the rapid adoption of the annotation scheme, a number of supporting features are provided.&lt;ref name="pmid18078503"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1752-0509-1-58 |title=MIRIAM Resources: Tools to generate and resolve robust cross-references in Systems Biology |year=2007 |last1=Laibe |first1=Camille |last2=Le Novère |first2=Nicolas |journal=BMC Systems Biology |volume=1 |page=58 |pmid=18078503 |pmc=2259379}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include [[Web Services]], a website interface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/miriam/ |title=MIRIAM Resources Website |publisher=Ebi.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; to access the Registry itself, and a Java library&lt;ref name="pmid19939940"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bib/bbp056 |title=BioModels.net Web Services, a free and integrated toolkit for computational modelling software |year=2009 |last1=Li |first1=C. |last2=Courtot |first2=M. |last3=Le Novere |first3=N. |last4=Laibe |first4=C. |journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=270–7 |pmid=19939940 |pmc=2913671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Naples Dioscurides''' in the [[Biblioteca Nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III|Biblioteca Nazionale]], [[Naples]] (MS Suppl. gr. 28), is an [[illuminated manuscript]] early 7th-century [[Greek language|Greek]] [[herbal]]. The book has 172 folios and a page size of 29.7 x 14 cm (11 11/16 x 5 1/2 inches) and the text is  a redaction of ''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]'' by the 1st century Greek military physician [[Dioscorides]], with descriptions of plants and their medicinal uses.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, 206&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike ''De Materia Medica'', the text is arranged alphabetically by plant.  The [[codex]] derives independently&lt;ref&gt;David H. Wright, "''Traditio'' and ''Inventio'' in Iconographic Transmission," Eighth Byzantine Studies Conference, Chicago 1982&lt;/ref&gt; from the same model as the [[Vienna Dioscurides]], which was created ca. 512 for a Byzantine princess, but differs from it significantly: &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| last = Dioscorides
| first = Pedanius
| title = Of Medical Substances - De materia medica - Dioscurides Neapolitanus
| work = World Digital Library
| accessdate = 2014-06-20
| url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/10690
}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the illustrations follow the same inferred model, they are rendered more naturalistically in the Naples Dioscurides. Additionally, in the Naples manuscript, the illustrations occupy the top half of each folio, rather than being full page miniatures as in the Vienna Dioscurides.  The plant descriptions are recorded below the illustration in two or three rather narrow columns, recalling the arrangement the earliest [[scroll]] version of the work would have had, before the [[codex]] form became near-universal.  The script is somewhat rough and uneven, and the painting style of the miniatures less precise and naturalistic than the Vienna manuscript, indicating a certain falling-off in standards.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, 206-207&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Paleography|style of Greek script]] used in the manuscript indicates that it was probably written in Byzantine-ruled southern [[Italy]], where ancient Greek cultural traditions remained strong, although it is not known exactly where it was produced.  

Marginal notes indicate that the manuscript had contact with the [[Schola Medica Salernitana|medical school at Salerno]] in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. 

A luxurious facsimile has been published by Salerno Editrice, Rome, in collaboration with Akademische Druck of Graz, Austria, publishers of a comparable facsimile of the Vienna Dioscurides.

The '''National Addiction and HIV Data Archive Program''' ('''NAHDAP''') is a [[Digital library|repository]] of drug abuse and [[HIV/AIDS research]] data primarily including social science and behavioral data.&lt;ref&gt;''Addiction,'' 106, 1708-1710&lt;/ref&gt; NAHDAP’s mission is to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction by supporting research across a wide range of disciplines and ensuring the rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of that research to improve prevention, treatment and policy.

==Description==

NAHDAP is a program within the [[ICPSR|Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)]], a unit in the Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the [[University of Michigan]]. NAHDAP's staff consists of professional researchers, data archivists and technicians working together to obtain, process, distribute, and promote amongst social science researchers [[Data sharing|sharing of data]] relevant to drug addiction and HIV. 

NAHDAP is a project of the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]], part of the [[National Institutes of Health]]. The [http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NAHDAP/ NAHDAP Web site] launched in June 2010 and offers a library of electronic data and [[citations]] to publications based on those data. NAHDAP provides technical assistance and resources to investigators to facilitate preparing their data for archiving so that they can be easily and effectively archived at project completion. NAHDAP also provides technical assistance to users of the data sets, including workshops and webinars, to train analysts in the unique characteristics of selected datasets, in [[Quantitative research|quantitative method]]s, and in the utility of analyzing [[Secondary data analysis|secondary data]] for the [[Reproduceability|reproduction of original research findings]] and addressing new research questions on major issues of social and behavioral sciences and public policy.

Novak]], [[Philip Ball]], [[Kitty Ferguson]], [[Jill Neimark]], [[Alan Lightman]], [[Tom Vanderbilt]], and [[George Musser]].

[[Cormac McCarthy]] made his non-fiction writing debut in Nautilus on 20 April 2017 with an article entitled The Kekulé Problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=Cormac|date=20 April 2017|title=The Kekulé Problem|url=http://nautil.us/issue/47/consciousness/the-kekul-problem|journal=Nautilus|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==

The word "nautilus" has a number of meanings that are referred to in the title of the magazine. "'The nautilus is so steeped in math and myth and story, from [[Nautilus (Verne)|Verne]] to the [[Golden ratio#Disputed observations|Golden Mean]] to the [[nautilus|spectacular sea creature]] itself,' [''Nautilus'' publisher John] Steele said, 'that it seemed a fitting namesake for the idea of connecting and illuminating science.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/science/a-glossy-science-magazine-or-living-fossil.html | title=A Magazine or a Living Fossil? | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=6 May 2013 | accessdate=5 March 2015 | author=Dennis Overbye}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
On 13 December 2017, twenty of ''Nautilus''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' freelance writers published "An Open Letter from Freelancers at Nautilus Magazine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nwu.org/an-open-letter-from-freelancers-at-nautilus-magazine/|title=An Open Letter from Freelancers at Nautilus Magazine|last1=Jessica|first1=Seigel|last2=and 19 others|website=National Writers Union|publisher=National Writers Union|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[National Writers Union]], alleging that the company was in arrears to them for $50,000 for unpaid work. They announced that ten of them had joined the NWU in order "to pursue a group non-payment grievance with legal action if necessary". On 15 December 2017, the ''Nautilus'' Publisher, John Steele, published a reply explaining the magazine's financial situation and taking responsibility for the late payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steele|first=John|title=A Letter from the Publisher of Nautilus|url=http://nautil.us/blog/a-letter-from-the-publisher-of-nautilus|journal=Nautilus|date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 1, 2018, the National Writers Union announced it had reached a settlement with Steele.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://splinternews.com/a-little-reminder-of-why-media-unions-matter-1822624549|title=A Little Reminder of Why Media Unions Matter|last=Uberti|first=David|work=Splinter|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnerships==

On March 20 2018, Nautilus announced a marketing partnership with Kalmbach Media, publisher of ''Discover'' and ''Astronomy'' Magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kalmbach.com/2018/03/20/kalmbach-media-announces-marketing-partnership-with-nautilus-magazine/|title=Kalmbach Media announces marketing partnership with Nautilus magazine|work=Kalmbach Media|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the partnership, the three magazines had a combined reach of 10 million users.

'''Nazia Khanum''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]] ({{lang-bn|নাজিয়া খানম}}; born 1943) is a [[Bangladesh]]i-born [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Management consulting|management consultant]], researcher, Director of Equality in Diversity, non-executive director for [[National Health Service|NHS]] Luton and chair of various voluntary community organisations.

==Early life==
Khanum was born in [[Barisal]], [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|Partition of Bengal]] (now [[Bangladesh]]), [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]]. Her exact date of birth is unknown because during that period birth certificates were not given unless they were specifically requested. She was named by her father who died when she was very young. She moved with her family to Charfassion, [[Dhaka]] where she was brought up.&lt;ref name="''lutonvoices"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu1W6Eo34Nc|title=Nazia Khanum|publisher=Luton Voices|date=8 June 2010|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lutonculture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lutonculture.com/community-projects/past-projects/luton-voices/volunteers/|title=Interviewees|publisher=Luton Culture|year=2010|accessdate=1 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213310/http://www.lutonculture.com/community-projects/past-projects/luton-voices/volunteers/|archivedate=4 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s, she brought her family to [[Luton]], [[Bedfordshire]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/threecounties/senseofplace/leap_of_faith.shtml |title=Leap of Faith |work=BBC News |date=February 2002 |accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Khanum has an BA and MA in political science from the [[University of Dhaka]], and a PhD in history from the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[University of London]].&lt;ref name="bbwhoswho11"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Karim |first1=Mohammed Abdul |last2=Karim |first2=Shahadoth |date=October 2011 |title=British Bangladeshi Who's Who |url=http://www.bbwhoswho.co.uk/images/who_%20who_2011.pdf |publisher=British Bangla Media Group |page=75 |isbn= |accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She worked over a long period as a lecturer and later as an assistant professor in [[Eden Girls' College, Bangladesh|Eden Girls' College]] and the [[University of Dhaka]] in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="equalbutdifferent"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equalbutdifferent.org.uk/pages/expertise_4.htm |title=Community Cohesion |website=Equal But Different |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044007/http://www.equalbutdifferent.org.uk/pages/expertise_4.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016 |accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PLate OPtimizer''', or '''PLOP''' is a [[CAD program]] used by [[Amateur telescope making|amateur telescope makers]] to design [[primary mirror]] [[Mirror support cell|support cells]] for [[reflecting telescope]]s. It was developed by [[telescope]] maker David Lewis, first described in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Cures for Unsupportive Mirror Cells| last = Lewis| first = David| journal = Sky &amp; Telescope| volume = | issue = June| pages = 132–135| date = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and used to simplify calculations needed in the design of mirror support cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Holm| first = Mark| title = Mirror Cells for Amateur Telescope Makers| work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.atmsite.org/contrib/Holm/Plop_optimized_cells/index.html| doi = | accessdate = May 3, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  It was based on Toshimi Taki's 1993 program PLATE,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~zs3t-tk/cell/cell.htm Taki's brief intro to cell design&lt;/ref&gt; with a simplified user interface, thus giving it wide acceptance among makers of large [[Dobsonian]] style amateur telescopes, with good support of mirrors as thin as two inches for a diameter of thirty inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Anderson-Lee
  | first = Jeff| title = Best of 18 and Over - A collection of plop cell designs
  | work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jonah/18plus/| format =| doi = | accessdate = May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons and limitations==
A basic mirror cell may be built using minimal calculation and simple materials such as wood and outdoor carpet, with a good example being [[John Dobson (astronomer)|Dobson's]] original telescopes. However, as amateurs sought to build larger and thinner mirrors, they found such designs inadequate.

Many amateur telescope makers use cells which are designed via [[equal area rule]] calculation, using programs such as David Chandler's [[public domain]] program, ''Cell''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Chandler| first = David| title = Floatation Mirror Cell Design| url = http://www.davidchandler.com/cell.htm| accessdate = 2009-06-21| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090817122733/http://www.davidchandler.com/cell.htm| archivedate = 2009-08-17| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such calculation does not account for mechanical stresses introduced in one part of a telescope mirror by another part, whereas [[finite element analysis]] can be used to reduce such [[Yield (engineering)|stress]]. Although general finite element analysis programs such as [[Nastran]] will work for mirror cells, an advantage of PLOP is that it can be set to ignore [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] that merely results in refocus of a mirror's [[parabola]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmsite.org/contrib/Holm/Plop_optimized_cells/cellfaq.html#old Atmsite PLOP FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; PLOP can be used to calculate floating support points for a mirror's [[Optical axis|axial]] (rear) support; however, additional tools are needed to calculate potential error from a mirror's lateral (edge) support.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cruxis.com/scope/mirroredgecalculator.htm ''Cruxis'' site mirror edge support calculator tool&lt;/ref&gt;

Mirror cell calculations, whether using PLOP or another program, do not overcome errors introduced by gluing the mirror to its cell, excessive tightening of edge supports, nor impingement of the cell structure onto the mirror as result of differential cooling shrinkage. The significantly more complex calculations arising from the support needs of large [[honeycomb mirror]]s and those using [[active optics]] systems are outside the design parameters of such programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medusa.as.arizona.edu/lbto/tech/ua9502.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703082028/http://medusa.as.arizona.edu/lbto/tech/ua9502.htm |archivedate=2010-07-03 |df= }} Mirror Support System for Large Honeycomb Mirrors&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Passemant astronomical clock''' is an [[astronomical clock]] designed by Claude-Simeon Passemant in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name=AllV /&gt; It is displayed in the ''Salon de la pendule'' in the [[petit appartement du roi]] on the first floor of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], France. The clock set the official time in [[France]] for the first time in the kingdom's history.&lt;ref name="S&amp;V"&gt;{{cite journal|language=fr|last=Kergoat|first=Morgane|year=2010|title=Les plus beaux instruments des sciences à l'honneur|journal=Les Cahiers de Science &amp; Vie|issue=hors-série ''Les Sciences au château de Versailles''|page=140|url=http://www.science-et-vie.com/Sommaire.asp?Type=CSV&amp;num=119|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928230817/http://www.science-et-vie.com/Sommaire.asp?Type=CSV&amp;num=119|archivedate=2011-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pendule astronomique de Passemant (25).JPG|thumb|Passemant astronomical clock]]

==Description==
The clock is an exceptional [[rococo]] work over {{convert|2|m}} in height, crowned with a moving celestial sphere. It shows the date, time, real time average phases of the moon and [[Heliocentrism|Copernican]] planetary motion. The large astronomical dials mark the rising and setting of the sun and moon every day. Earth is represented by a bronze globe on which all countries are engraved with the main cities. This globe is placed among the rocks and waterfalls, which serve as a universal horizon.

The mechanism is designed to be able to display the date until the end of the year 9999.&lt;ref name ="S&amp;V"/&gt;

==Creators==
The clock mechanism was designed by engineer Claude-Siméon Passemant (1702–1769) and executed by the clockmaker Louis Dauthiau (1730–1809).&lt;ref name= Babelon&gt;''Versailles: absolutism and harmony'' by Jean Pierre Babelon, Claire Constans 1998 {{ISBN|2-7028-1125-6}} page 174&lt;/ref&gt; The rococo-style gilt-bronze box protecting the mechanism was made in 1753 by sculptor [[Jean-Jacques Caffieri]] (1735–1792) and bronze-founder [[Philippe Caffieri (1714–1774)|Philippe Caffieri]].

==History==
After being reviewed and approved by the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in August 1749, the clock was presented to [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] in [[Château de Choisy|Choisy]] by the [[Michel Ferdinand d'Albert d'Ailly|duc de Chaulnes]] on 7 September 1750.&lt;ref name=AllV &gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qosM6YrWB_cC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=Passemant+astronomical+clock&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kZwiTrjGMcSe-QbK86ywAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Passemant%20astronomical%20clock&amp;f=false ''All Versailles'' by J. G. D' Hoste 1988 ASIN B0007BXHLQ page 62]&lt;/ref&gt; The King acquired it the same year. In January 1754, the clock took its place among the astronomical clocks of Versailles. The fact that it was placed in the ''Salon de la pendule'' demonstrates the interest that Louis XV had in the mechanical arts through clockmaking. Indeed, the room was so named because the dials of clocks were set into the wall panelling.

'''Petrus de Dacia''', also called '''Philomena''' and '''Peder Nattergal''' (Peter Nightingale), was a [[Danish people|Danish]] scholar who lived in the 13th century. He worked mainly in [[Paris]] and [[Italy]], writing in [[Latin]]. He published a calendar of [[new moon]] dates for the years 1292 - 1367. In 1292, he published a book on mathematics that contained a new methods for the calculation of [[cubic root]]s. He also described a mechanical instrument to predict solar and lunar [[eclipse]]s as seen from Paris.

A '''proper frame''', or '''comoving frame''', is a [[frame of reference]] that is attached to an object. The object in this frame is stationary within the frame, which is useful for many types of calculations.

For example, a freely falling [[elevator]] is a proper frame for a [[Free fall|free-falling]] object in the elevator, while the surface of the Earth is not. 

Proper frames can be [[Inertial_reference_frame|inertial]] and [[Non-inertial_reference_frame|non-inertial]], as in the example above.

The use of a proper frame is essential for the investigation of physical laws within the framework of [[general relativity]].

The scanners are regularly used for passive remote sensing from space, and in spectral analysis on production lines, for example with [[near-infrared spectroscopy]] used to identify contaminated food and feed.&lt;ref name="New food"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newfoodmagazine.com/14111/new-food-magazine/digital-issues/issue-3-2014-digital-edition/ | title=From targeted to untargeted detection of contaminants and foreign bodies in food and feed using NIR spectroscopy | work=New Food magazine | date=June 2014 | accessdate=26 June 2014 | author=Vincent Baeten | author2=Philippe Vermeulen | author3=Juan Antonio Fernández Pierna | author4=Pierre Dardenne | last-author-amp=yes | pages=18–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moving scanner line in a traditional photocopier (or a scanner or facsimile machine) is also a familiar, everyday example of a push broom scanner.  Push broom scanners and the [[whisk broom scanner]]s variant (also known as across-track scanners) are often contrasted with [[staring array]]s (such as in a digital camera), which image objects without scanning, and are more familiar to most people.

In orbital push broom sensors, a line of sensors arranged perpendicular to the flight direction of the spacecraft is used. Different areas of the surface are imaged as the spacecraft flies forward. A push broom scanner can gather more light than a whisk broom scanner because it looks at a particular area for a longer time, like a long exposure on a camera. One drawback of pushbroom sensors is the varying sensitivity of the individual detectors. These sensors are also known as ''survey'' or ''wide field'' devices, comparable to wide angle lenses on conventional cameras.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

In mechanical [[horology]], a '''remontoire''' (from the French ''remonter'', meaning 'to wind') is a small secondary source of power, a weight or [[spring (device)|spring]], which runs the timekeeping mechanism and is itself periodically rewound by the timepiece's main power source, such as a [[mainspring]].  It was used in precision [[clock]]s and [[watch]]es to place the source of power closer to the [[escapement]], thereby increasing the accuracy by evening out variations in drive force caused by unevenness of the [[friction]] in the geartrain.  In spring-driven precision clocks, a gravity remontoire is often used to replace the uneven force delivered by the mainspring running down by the more constant force of gravity acting on a weight.  In [[turret clock]]s, it serves to separate the large forces needed to drive the hands from the modest forces needed to drive the [[escapement]] which keeps the [[pendulum]] swinging.  A remontoire should not be confused with a ''[[maintaining power]] spring'', which is used only to keep the timepiece going while it is being wound.

==How it works==
Remontoires are used because the timekeeping mechanism in clocks and watches, the [[pendulum]] or [[balance wheel]], is never [[isochronous]]; its rate is affected by changes in the drive force applied to it.  In spring-driven timepieces, the drive force declines as the [[mainspring]] runs down.  In weight-driven clocks the drive force, provided by a weight suspended by a cord, is more constant,  but imperfections in the gear train and variations in lubrication also cause small variations.   In [[turret clock]]s, the large hands, which are attached to the clock's wheel train, are exposed to the weather on the outside of the tower, so winds and accumulations of ice and snow apply disturbing forces to the hands, which are passed on to the wheel train.

With a remontoire, the only force applied to the clock's [[escapement]] is that of the remontoire's spring or weight, so that it is isolated from any variations in the main power source or wheel train, which is just used to rewind the remontoire.   Remontoires are designed to rewind frequently, at intervals between fifteen seconds and an hour.  The rewinding process is triggered automatically when the remontoire's weight or spring reaches the end of its power.  This frequent rewinding is another source of accuracy, because it averages out any variations in the clock's rate due to changes in the force of the remontoire itself.  If the rate of the clock varies as the remontoire spring runs down, this variation will be repeated again and again, each time the remontoire goes through its cycle, so it will have no effect on the long term rate of the clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

==History==
The gravity remontoire was invented by Swiss clockmaker [[Jost Burgi]] around 1595. Usually the "Kalenderuhr" (three month running, springdriven,  calendar-desk-clock) Burgi made for [[William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel) (now Inventory No. U 47 at the Naturwissenschaftlich-Technische Sammlung in Kassel) is considered the oldest surviving clock with a remontoire, even if it does not provide power to the escapement during the few seconds of the daily cycle where the remontoire weight gets wound up by the spring.&lt;ref&gt;Karsten Gaulke: Der Ptolemãus von Kassel; Kassel: 2007; {{ISBN|978-3-931787-43-1}}, Page 143&lt;/ref&gt;  Today remontoire mechanisms are all designed to deliver power to the escapement during the remontoire reset cycle.

The spring remontoire was invented by English clockmaker [[John Harrison]] during development of his H2 [[marine chronometer]] in 1739. Harrison's working drawing of the device is preserved in the Library of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers in London, England.&lt;ref&gt;"Mechanical Notes and Drawing Compiled by John Harrison and his son William c.1726-1772", p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

Many French and Swiss [[pocketwatch]]es after 1860 were stamped on the back with the word ''Remontoire''.  This merely meant that they didn't have to be wound with a key (i.e. they were wound by the then-novel winding crown inside the pendant).  Etymologically the term is correct, the mainspring is "rewound" by some other force than a key, but these watches usually do not contain a remontoire as the word is used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Types==
Remontoires are distinguished by their power source:
*A ''gravity remontoire'' is one that uses a weight for power.  It is used in precision [[pendulum clock]]s.
*A ''spring remontoire'' uses a spring.  It is the only type which can be used in watches, since the force of a weight would be disturbed by motions of the wearer's wrist
*An ''electric remontoire'' can be either a gravity or spring type.  In it, the weight or spring is rewound electrically, with a motor or [[solenoid]].  It is used in clocks with traditional mechanical movements which are run on electricity.
They can also be classified by where in the wheel train the remontoire is located:
*An ''escapement remontoire'' applies its force directly to the escape wheel of the escapement.  Spring remontoires were usually of this type.
*A ''train remontoire'' applies its force to one of the wheels upstream from the escapement, usually to the wheel that drives the escape wheel.

==Electric remontoires in automobile clocks==
Before the common use of electronic clocks in automobiles, automobile clocks had mechanical movements, powered by an electric remontoire.  A low power drive spring would be wound every few minutes by a plunger in a [[solenoid]], powered by the vehicle's service battery and activated by a switch when the spring tension got too low. Such clocks were, however, notoriously inaccurate, typically being made as cheaply as possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6270">'''SIGCSE''' is the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]'s [[Special Interest Group]] on Computer Science Education, which provides a forum for educators to discuss issues related to the development, implementation, and/or evaluation of computing programs, curricula, and courses, as well as syllabi, laboratories, and other elements of teaching and pedagogy.  It is also the name of one of the three annual events organized by SIGCSE. This event, the ACM [[SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education]], is held annually in February or March in the USA. SIGCSE also sponsors an annual conference in or around Europe, named ITiCSE (Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education), usually in late June, and an annual research workshop named ICER (International Computing Education Research), at varied locations, usually in August.

The main focus of SIGCSE is higher education, and discussions include improving computer science education at high school level and below. The membership level has held steady at around 3300 members for several years. The current chair of SIGCSE is
[[Amber Settle]] for July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2019.

==Conferences==

SIGCSE has three annual conferences.

* The Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education conference is held in the United States with an average annual attendance of approximately 1300. The next conference will be held February 27 through March 2, 2019 in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sigcse2019.sigcse.org/|title=SIGCSE 2019|website=sigcse2019.sigcse.org|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The annual conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE). The next one will be held Monday 2 July through Wednesday 4 July 2018 in [[Larnaca, Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iticse.acm.org/|title=ITiCSE 2018|website=iticse.acm.org|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conference is attended by about 200-300 and is mainly held in Europe, but has also been held in countries outside of Europe ([[Turkey]] - 2010), ([[Israel]] - 2012), and ([[Peru]] - 2016).
* The International Computing Education Research (ICER) Conference. This conference has about 70 attendees and is held in the United States every other year. On the alternate years it rotates between [[Europe]] and [[Australasia]].  The next conference will be held August 13 through August 15, 2018 in [[Espoo, Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icer.acm.org/|title=ICER Conference {{!}} International Computing Education Research|website=icer.acm.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Newsletter/Bulletin==
The SIGCSE Bulletin is a quarterly newsletter that was first published in 1969. It evolved from an informal gathering of news and ideas to a venue for columns, editor-reviewed articles, research announcements, editorials, symposium proceedings, etc.

In 2010, with the inception of ACM Inroads magazine, the Bulletin was transformed into an electronic newsletter sent to all SIGCSE members providing communications about SIGCSE: announcing activities, publicizing events, and highlighting topics of interest. In other words, it has returned to its roots.

In [[rheology]], '''shear thinning''' is the [[non-Newtonian fluid|non-Newtonian]] behavior of fluids whose [[viscosity]] decreases under [[shear strain]]. It is sometimes considered synonymous for pseudoplastic behaviour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mezger|first1=Thomas G.|title=The rheology handbook : for users of rotational and oscillatory rheometers|date=2006|publisher=Vincentz Network|location=Hannover|isbn=9783878701743|page=34|edition=2., rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heldman|first1=R.

==Relationship with thixotropy==
Some authors consider shear-thinning to be a special case of thixotropic behaviour, because the recovery of the microstructure of the liquid to its initial state will always require a non-zero time. When the recovery of viscosity after disturbance is very rapid however, the observed behaviour is classic shear-thinning or pseudoplasticity, because as soon as the shear is removed, the viscosity returns to normal. When it takes a measurable time for the viscosity to recover, thixotropic behaviour is observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Howard A.|title=Thixotropy a review|journal=J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech., 70|year=1997|page=3|url=http://www.dfi.uchile.cl/~rsoto/docencia/FluidosNoNewton2008/trixotropia.pdf|accessdate=2011-11-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430015102/http://www.dfi.uchile.cl/~rsoto/docencia/FluidosNoNewton2008/trixotropia.pdf|archivedate=2016-04-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When describing the viscosity of liquids, however, it is therefore useful to distinguish shear-thinning (pseudoplastic) behaviour from thixotropic behaviour, where the viscosity at all shear rates is decreased for some duration after agitation: both of these effects can often be seen separately in the same liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=editor|first1=David B. Troy,|title=Remington : The science and practice of pharmacy|date=2005|publisher=Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9780781746731|page=344|edition=21st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NFGSSSbaWjwC&amp;pg=PA344|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Everyday examples ==

Modern [[paint]]s are examples of pseudoplastic materials. When modern paints are applied, the shear created by the brush or roller will allow them to thin and wet out the surface evenly. Once applied, the paints regain their higher viscosity, which avoids drips and runs. [[Ketchup]] is a shear-thinning fluid.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12660">{{short description|An exact solution of the Euler equations for periodic surface gravity waves}}
[[File:Trochoidal wave.svg|thumb|400px|Surface elevation of a trochoidal wave (deep blue) propagating to the right. The trajectories of [[free surface]] particles are close circles (in cyan), and the [[flow velocity]] is shown in red, for the black particles. The [[wave height]] – difference between the crest and trough elevation – is denoted as &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, the [[wavelength]] as &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and the phase speed as &lt;math&gt;c.&lt;/math&gt;]]

In [[fluid dynamics]], a '''trochoidal wave''' or '''Gerstner wave''' is an exact solution of the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] for [[periodic function|periodic]] [[surface gravity wave]]s. It describes a [[progressive wave]] of permanent form on the surface of an [[incompressible fluid]] of infinite depth. The free surface of this wave solution is an inverted (upside-down) [[trochoid]] – with sharper [[crest (physics)|crest]]s and flat troughs. This wave solution was discovered by [[František Josef Gerstner|Gerstner]] in 1802, and rediscovered independently by [[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine]] in 1863.

The flow field associated with the trochoidal wave is not [[irrotational flow|irrotational]]: it has [[vorticity]]. The vorticity is of such a specific strength and vertical distribution that the trajectories of the [[fluid parcel]]s are closed circles. This is in contrast with the usual experimental observation of [[Stokes drift]] associated with the wave motion. Also the [[phase speed]] is independent of the trochoidal wave's [[amplitude]], unlike other nonlinear wave-theories (like those of the [[Stokes wave]] and [[cnoidal wave]]) and observations. For these reasons – as well as for the fact that solutions for finite fluid depth are lacking – trochoidal waves are of limited use for engineering applications.

In [[computer graphics]], the [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] of realistic-looking [[ocean wave]]s can be done by use of so-called '''Gerstner waves'''. This is a multi-component and multi-directional extension of the traditional Gerstner wave, often using [[fast Fourier transform]]s to make (real-time) [[animation]] feasible.&lt;ref name=Tessendorf&gt;{{harvtxt|Tessendorf|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of classical trochoidal wave==

Using a [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian specification of the flow field]], the motion of fluid parcels is – for a [[periodic function|periodic]] wave on the surface of a fluid layer of infinite depth:&lt;ref name=Lamb&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|1994|loc=§251}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
    X(a,b,t) &amp;= a + \frac{\mathrm{e}^{kb}}{k} \sin \left( k(a+ct) \right), \\
    Y(a,b,t) &amp;= b - \frac{\mathrm{e}^{kb}}{k} \cos \left( k(a+ct) \right), 
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x=X(a,b,t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=Y(a,b,t)&lt;/math&gt; are the positions of the fluid parcels in the &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; plane at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; the horizontal coordinate and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; the vertical coordinate (positive upward, in the direction opposing gravity). The Lagrangian coordinates &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; label the fluid parcels, with &lt;math&gt;(x,y)=(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; the centres of the circular orbits – around which the corresponding fluid parcel moves with constant [[speed]] &lt;math&gt;c\,\exp(kb).&lt;/math&gt; Further &lt;math&gt;k=2\pi/\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavenumber]] (and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; the [[wavelength]]), while &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the phase speed with which the wave propagates in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-direction. The phase speed satisfies the [[dispersion (water waves)|dispersion]] relation:

:&lt;math&gt;c^2=\frac{g}{k},&lt;/math&gt;

which is independent of the wave nonlinearity (i.e. does not depend on the wave height &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;), and this phase speed &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the same as for [[Airy wave theory|Airy's linear waves]] in deep water.

The free surface is a line of constant pressure, and is found to correspond with a line &lt;math&gt;b=b_s&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;b_s&lt;/math&gt; is a (nonpositive) constant. For &lt;math&gt;b_s=0&lt;/math&gt; the highest waves occur, with a [[cusp (singularity)|cusp]]-shaped crest. Note that the highest (irrotational) [[Stokes wave]] has a [[wave crest|crest]] angle of 120°, instead of the 0° for the rotational trochoidal wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first= G.G. | last= Stokes | authorlink=Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet | year= 1880 | contribution= Supplement to a paper on the theory of oscillatory waves | title= Mathematical and Physical Papers, Volume I | publisher= Cambridge University Press | pages= 314–326 | url=https://archive.org/details/mathphyspapers01stokrich | oclc = 314316422 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[wave height]] of the trochoidal wave is &lt;math&gt;H=(2/k)\exp(kb_s).&lt;/math&gt; The wave is periodic in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-direction, with wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda;&lt;/math&gt; and also periodic in time with [[frequency|period]] &lt;math&gt;T=\lambda/c=\sqrt{2\pi\lambda/g}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[vorticity]] &lt;math&gt;\varpi&lt;/math&gt; under the trochoidal wave is:&lt;ref name=Lamb/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\varpi(a,b,t) = - \frac{2\,k\,c\,\mathrm{e}^{2kb}}{1-\mathrm{e}^{2kb}},&lt;/math&gt;

varying with Lagrangian elevation &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and diminishing rapidly with depth below the free surface.

(The animation is periodic in time; it can be set to loop after right-clicking on it while it is playing).]]

A multi-component and multi-directional extension of the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian description]] of the free-surface motion – as used in Gerstner's trochoidal wave – is used in [[computer graphics]] for the simulation of ocean waves.&lt;ref name=Tessendorf/&gt; For the classical Gerstner wave the fluid motion exactly satisfies the nonlinear, [[incompressible]] and [[inviscid]] flow equations below the free surface. However, the extended Gerstner waves do in general not satisfy these flow equations exactly (although they satisfy them approximately, i.e. for the linearised Lagrangian description by [[potential flow]]). This description of the ocean can be programmed very efficiently by use of the [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT). Moreover, the resulting ocean waves from this process look realistic, as a result of the nonlinear deformation of the free surface (due to the Lagrangian specification of the motion): sharper [[crest (physics)|crest]]s and flatter [[trough (physics)|trough]]s.

The mathematical description of the free-surface in these Gerstner waves can be as follows:&lt;ref name=Tessendorf/&gt; the horizontal coordinates are denoted as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, and the vertical coordinate is &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. The [[average|mean]] level of the free surface is at &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt; and the positive &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-direction is upward, opposing the [[Earth's gravity]] of strength &lt;math&gt;g.&lt;/math&gt; The free surface is described [[parametric equation|parametrically]] as a function of the parameters &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta,&lt;/math&gt; as well as of time &lt;math&gt;t.&lt;/math&gt; The parameters are connected to the mean-surface points &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)=(\alpha,0,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; around which the [[fluid parcel]]s at the wavy surface orbit. The free surface is specified through &lt;math&gt;x=\xi(\alpha,\beta,t),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;y=\zeta(\alpha,\beta,t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z=\eta(\alpha,\beta,t)&lt;/math&gt; with:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  \xi   &amp;= \alpha - \sum_{m=1}^M \frac{k_{x,m}}{k_m}\, \frac{a_m}{\tanh\left( k_m\, h \right)}\, \sin\left( \theta_m \right),
  \\
  \eta  &amp;= \beta  - \sum_{m=1}^M \frac{k_{z,m}}{k_m}\, \frac{a_m}{\tanh\left( k_m\, h \right)}\, \sin\left( \theta_m \right),
  \\
  \zeta &amp;= \sum_{m=1}^M a_m\, \cos\left( \theta_m \right)
  \quad\text{and}
  \\
  \theta_m &amp;= k_{x,m}\, \alpha + k_{z,m}\, \beta - \omega_m\, t - \phi_m,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tanh&lt;/math&gt; is the [[hyperbolic tangent]] function, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the number of wave components considered, &lt;math&gt;a_m&lt;/math&gt; is the [[amplitude]] of component &lt;math&gt;{m=1\dots M}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_m&lt;/math&gt; its phase. Further &lt;math&gt;{k_m=\scriptstyle\sqrt{(k_{x,m}^2+k_{z,m}^2)}}&lt;/math&gt; is its [[wavenumber]] and &lt;math&gt;\omega_m&lt;/math&gt; its [[angular frequency]]. The latter two, &lt;math&gt;k_m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_m,&lt;/math&gt; can not be chosen independently but are related through the [[dispersion (water waves)|dispersion relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_m^2 = g\, k_m\, \tanh \left( k_m\, h \right),&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; the mean water depth. In deep water (&lt;math&gt;h\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;) the hyperbolic tangent goes to one: &lt;math&gt;{\tanh(k_m\,h)\to 1.}&lt;/math&gt; The components &lt;math&gt;k_{x,m}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_{z,m}&lt;/math&gt; of the horizontal wavenumber [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{k}_m&lt;/math&gt; determine the wave propagation direction of component &lt;math&gt;m.&lt;/math&gt;

The choice of the various parameters &lt;math&gt;a_m, k_{x,m}, k_{z,m}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_m&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;{m=1,\dots,{M},}&lt;/math&gt; and a certain mean depth &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; determines the form of the ocean surface. A clever choice is needed in order to exploit the possibility of fast computation by means of the FFT. See e.g. {{harvtxt|Tessendorf|2001}} for a description how to do this. Most often, the wavenumbers are chosen on a regular grid in &lt;math&gt;(k_x,k_z)&lt;/math&gt;-space. Thereafter, the amplitudes &lt;math&gt;a_m&lt;/math&gt; and phases &lt;math&gt;\phi_m&lt;/math&gt; are chosen randomly in accord with the [[spectral density|variance-density spectrum]] of a certain desired [[sea state]]. Finally, by FFT, the  ocean surface can be constructed in such a way that it is [[periodic function|periodic]] both in space and time, enabling [[tessellation (computer graphics)|tiling]] – creating periodicity in time by slightly shifting the frequencies &lt;math&gt;\omega_m&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\omega_m=m\,\Delta\omega&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;{m=1,\dots,{M}.}&lt;/math&gt;

In rendering, also the [[normal (geometry)|normal vector]] &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{n}&lt;/math&gt; to the surface is often needed. These can be computed using the [[cross product]] (&lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;) as:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{n} = \frac{\partial\boldsymbol{s}}{\partial\alpha} \times \frac{\partial\boldsymbol{s}}{\partial\beta}
  \quad \text{with} \quad
  \boldsymbol{s}(\alpha,\beta,t) 
    = \begin{pmatrix} \xi(\alpha,\beta,t) \\ \zeta(\alpha,\beta,t) \\ \eta(\alpha,\beta,t) \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[unit vector|unit]] normal vector then is &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{e}_n=\boldsymbol{n}/\|\boldsymbol{n}\|,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\|\boldsymbol{n}\|&lt;/math&gt; the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''USS ''Hornet'' (CV/CVA/CVS-12)''' is a [[United States Navy]] [[aircraft carrier]] of the [[Essex class aircraft carrier|''Essex'' class]]. Construction started in August 1942. She was originally named {{USS|Kearsarge}} but was renamed in honor of the prior {{USS|Hornet|CV-8}}, which was lost in October 1942, becoming the eighth ship to bear the name.

''Hornet'' was commissioned 29 November 1943, and after three months of training joined the [[United States|U.S.]] forces in the [[Pacific War]]. She played a major part in the Pacific battles of [[World War II]], and also took part in [[Operation Magic Carpet]], returning troops to the U.S. Following World War II, she served in the [[Vietnam War]], and also played a part in the [[Apollo program]], recovering the [[Apollo 11]] and [[Apollo 12]] astronauts as they returned from the Moon.

''Hornet'' was finally decommissioned in 1970. She was eventually designated as both a [[National Historic Landmark]] and a [[California Historical Landmark]], and in 1998 she opened to the public as the [[USS Hornet Museum|USS ''Hornet'' Museum]] in [[Alameda, California]].

==Construction: 1940 to 1943==
The contract to build ''Kearsarge'' had been given to [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding]] on 9 September 1940, and her keel was laid down on 3 August 1942. The seventh {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|3}} was sunk in the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands|Battle of Santa Cruz]] on 26 October 1942, and the CV-12 hull was renamed ''Hornet'' (the name ''Kearsarge'' is still stamped into her [[keel plate]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Larger and more advanced than her [[Yorktown class aircraft carrier|Yorktown-class]] namesake, she was launched on 30 August 1943 and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 29 November 1943. Her first commander was [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] (later [[Rear Admiral]]) [[Miles R. Browning]].

==Service history==

===World War II: 1944 to 1947===
The ''Hornet'' conducted shakedown training off [[Bermuda]] before departing Norfolk on 14 February 1944 to join the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] on 20 March at [[Majuro Atoll]] in the [[Marshall Islands]]. After lending air support to protect the invasion beaches in [[New Guinea]], she conducted massive aerial raids against Japanese bases in the [[Caroline Islands]] and prepared to support the amphibious assault for the occupation of the [[Marianas Islands]].

[[File:USS Hornet (CV-12) underway in early 1945 (NNAM.2000.290.008).jpg|thumb|left|''Hornet'' in early 1945.]]

On 11 June, ''Hornet'' launched raids on [[Tinian]] and [[Saipan]]. The following day she conducted heavy bombing attacks on [[Guam]] and [[Rota (island)|Rota]]. On 15–16 June, she blasted Japanese air fields at [[Iwo Jima]] and [[Chichi Jima]] to prevent air attacks on troops invading Saipan in the Marianas. The afternoon of 18 June, ''Hornet'' formed with the Fast Carrier Task Force to intercept the Japanese First Mobile Fleet, headed through the Philippine Sea for Saipan. The [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] began on 19 June, when ''Hornet'' launched strikes to destroy as many land-based Japanese planes as possible before the carrier-based Japanese aircraft came in effectively.

The Japanese approached the American carriers in four massive waves, full of young and inexperienced pilots. [[Fighter aircraft]] from ''Hornet'' and other U.S. carriers, whose veteran pilots' skills were honed to perfection, broke up and savaged all the attacks before the Japanese aerial raiders reached the task force. Nearly every Japanese aircraft was shot down in the great air battles of 19 June that became commonly known as "[[Battle of the Philippine Sea|The Marianas Turkey Shoot]]". As the Japanese Mobile Fleet fled in defeat on 20 June, the carriers launched long-range airstrikes that sank the {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiyō}} and so damaged two tankers that they were abandoned and scuttled. [[Vice Admiral]] [[Jisaburō Ozawa]]'s own flag log for 20 June 1944 showed his surviving carrier air power as only 35 operational aircraft out of the 430 planes with which he had commenced the Battle of the Philippine Sea.

''Hornet'', based at [[Eniwetok]] in the Marshalls, raided Japanese installations ranging from Guam to the Bonins, then turned her attention to the Palaus, throughout the [[Philippine Sea]], and to Japanese bases on [[Okinawa]] and [[Taiwan|Formosa]]. Her aircraft gave direct support to the troops invading [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] on 20 October 1944. During the [[Battle for Leyte Gulf]] she launched damaging raids on the Japanese center force in the [[Battle off Samar]], and hastened the retreat of the Japanese fleet through the [[Sibuyan Sea]] towards [[Borneo]].

In the following months, ''Hornet'' attacked Japanese shipping and airfields throughout the [[Philippines]]. This included participation in a raid that destroyed an entire Japanese convoy in [[Ormoc Bay]]. On 30 December, she departed [[Ulithi]] in the Carolines for raids against Formosa, [[Indo-China]], and the [[Pescadores Islands]]. En route back to Ulithi, ''Hornet''{{'}}s planes conducted photo reconnaissance of Okinawa on 22 January 1945 to aid the planned invasion of that "last stepping-stone to [[Japan]]".

''Hornet'' again departed Ulithi on 10 February for full-scale aerial assaults on [[Tokyo]], then supported the amphibious landing assault on Iwo Jima on 19–20 February.

Repeated raids were made against the Tokyo plains industrial complex, and Okinawa was hard hit. On 1 April, ''Hornet'' planes gave direct support to the amphibious assault landings on Okinawa. On 6 April, her aircraft joined in attacks which sank the  {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato}} and her task force as it closed on Okinawa. The ''Hornet'' launched 3 torpedoes and her aircraft dropped 4 bombs on the ''Yamato''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usshornet.stores.yahoo.net/usshornetdvd.html|title=8 Ships Named Hornet|website=usshornet.stores.yahoo.net|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' The following two months found ''Hornet'' alternating between close support to ground troops on Okinawa and hard-hitting raids to destroy the industrial capacity of Japan. She was caught in a howling typhoon 4–5 June which collapsed some 25&amp;nbsp;ft (8&amp;nbsp;m) of her forward flight deck.

[[File:USS Hornet (CV-12) damaged flight deck 1945.jpg|thumb|left|Damaged by typhoon.]]

For 16 continuous months, she was in action in the forward areas of the Pacific combat zone, sometimes within {{convert|40|mi|km|-1|abbr=on}} of the Japanese home islands. Under air attack 59 times, she was never hit. Her aircraft destroyed 1,410 Japanese aircraft; only {{USS|Essex|CV-9|2}} exceeded this record. 10 of her pilots attained "Ace in a Day" status; 30 of her 42 VF-2 [[F6F Hellcat]] pilots were aces. In one day, her aircraft shot down 72 Japanese aircraft, and in one month, they shot down 255 aircraft. ''Hornet'' supported nearly every Pacific amphibious landing after March 1944. Her air groups destroyed or damaged 1,269,710&amp;nbsp;tons (1,151,860&amp;nbsp;tonnes) of Japanese shipping, and scored the critical first hits in sinking ''Yamato''.

''Hornet'' earned nine [[battle star]]s for her service in [[World War II]]. Seven battle stars were earned as the sole receiver in 1944. Two were earned together as Hornet and her air groups when the Navy changed their nomenclature in 1945. She was one of nine carriers to be awarded the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]].

Following the typhoon that collapsed the forward edge of her flight deck, ''Hornet'' was routed back to the Philippines and from there to San Francisco, arriving on 7 July. Her overhaul was complete by 13 September when she departed as a part of [[Operation Magic Carpet]] that saw her return troops home from the Marianas and Hawaiian Islands. She returned to San Francisco on 9 February 1946. She decommissioned there on 15 January 1947, and joined the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

===Peacetime tensions: 1951 to 1959===
''Hornet'' was recommissioned on 20 March 1951, then sailed from San Francisco for the [[New York Naval Shipyard]] where she was decommissioned on 12 May for conversion to an attack aircraft carrier '''CVA-12''', under the [[SCB-27]] upgrade program. On 11 September 1953, she was recommissioned as an attack carrier. The ship then trained in the [[Caribbean Sea]] before departure from Norfolk on 11 May 1954 on an eight-month global cruise.

[[File:USS Hornet (CVA-12) en route to Guantanamo Bay on 10 January 1954 (80-G-K-17108).jpg|thumb|left|''Hornet'' following her SCB-27A conversion.]]

After operations in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Indian Ocean]], ''Hornet'' joined the mobile [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]] in the [[South China Sea]] to search for survivors of a [[Cathay Pacific]] Airways passenger plane, shot down by Chinese aircraft near Hainan Island. On 25 July, ''Hornet'' aircraft supported planes from {{USS|Philippine Sea|CV-47|2}} as they shot down two attacking Chinese fighters. After tensions eased, she returned to San Francisco on 12 December, trained out of [[San Diego]], then sailed on 4 May 1955 to join the 7th Fleet in the Far East.

''Hornet'' helped to cover the evacuation of Vietnamese from the Communist-controlled north to [[South Vietnam]], then ranged from Japan to Formosa, Okinawa, and the Philippines in readiness training with the 7th Fleet. She returned to San Diego on 10 December and entered the [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] the following month for the [[SCB-125]] upgrade, a conversion which included a [[History of the aircraft carrier#Hurricane bow|hurricane bow]] and the installation of an [[Flight deck#Angled flight deck|angled flight deck]], which permits the simultaneous launching and recovery of aircraft.

Following her modernization overhaul, ''Hornet'' operated along the [[California]] coast. She departed San Diego on 21 January 1957 to bolster the strength of the 7th Fleet until her return from the troubled Far East on 25 July.

Following a similar cruise, 6 January – 2 July 1958, the ship was redesignated '''CVS-12''' (anti-submarine warfare support carrier). In August, she entered [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] for the conversion work to an ASW carrier. On 3 April 1959, she sailed from [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] to join the 7th Fleet in antisubmarine warfare tactics ranging from Japan to Okinawa and the Philippines. She returned home in October, for training along the western seaboard.

In the following years, ''Hornet'' was regularly deployed to the 7th Fleet for operations ranging from the coast of South Vietnam, to the shores of Japan, the Philippines and Okinawa; and she also played a key part in the [[Apollo program]], as a recovery ship&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepostandreview.com/site/hornet-plus-three/ "Hornet Plus Three"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717022434/http://thepostandreview.com/site/hornet-plus-three/ |date=17 July 2011 }}, ''Post and Review''.

On 25 August 1966, she was on recovery station for the flight of [[AS-202]], the second unmanned flight of a production [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo Command and Service Module]]. The moonship rocketed three-quarters of the way around the globe in 93 minutes before splashdown near [[Wake Island]]. Scorched from the heat of its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, the Apollo space capsule, designed to carry American astronauts to the moon, was brought aboard ''Hornet'' after its test; that command module is currently on display aboard ''Hornet''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=APST202 ''AS-202''], NASA (NSSDC ID: APST202)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chariots8_2&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch8-2.html ''Chariots for Apollo: A History of Manned Lunar Spacecraft''], Chapter 8.2, ''Qualifying Missions''.

''Hornet'' returned to Long Beach on 8 September, but headed back to the Far East on 27 March 1967. She reached Japan exactly a month later and departed [[United States Fleet Activities Sasebo|the Sasebo base]] on 19 May for the war zone. She operated in Vietnamese waters throughout the first half of 1967.

''Hornet'' recovered the astronauts from the first moon landing mission, [[Apollo 11]], on 24 July 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1969-059A ''Apollo 11''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918002017/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1969-059A |date=18 September 2012 }}, NASA (NSSDC ID: 1969-059A)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]] was on board to welcome the returning astronauts back to Earth, where they lived in quarantine aboard ''Hornet'' prior to transfer to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at Houston.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasaexplores.com/extras/apollo11/hirasaki.html ''A Front Row Seat For History''], NASAexplores, 15 July 2004.

''Hornet'' once again served in the space program with the recovery of [[Apollo 12]] on 24 November. Returning astronauts [[Pete Conrad|Charles Conrad, Jr.]], [[Alan Bean|Alan L. Bean]], and [[Richard F. Gordon, Jr.]], were picked up from their splashdown point near [[American Samoa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1969-099A ''Apollo 12''], NASA (NSSDC ID: 1969-099A).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement: 1970 to present===
''Hornet'' was decommissioned 26 June 1970 and mothballed at the [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility]]. ''Hornet'' was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 25 July 1989.

'''William Stephenson''' (19 April 1889 – 19 August 1953) was an English [[Fireman (steam engine)|marine engine stoker]]. He is best known for his service in the [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] of 1914–1916.&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enduranceobituaries.co.uk/stephenson.htm |title=The Endurance Obituaries: William H. Stephenson |author=John F. Mann |year=2009 |work= |website=Enduranceobituaries.co.uk |accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Stephenson was born on 19 April 1889 in [[Kingston upon Hull]], probably in the suburb of [[Sculcoates]].  He served from 1914 until 1915 as a stoker aboard the ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]'', the exploration vessel built for the [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] headed by of Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]],  After the vessel sank in late 1915, Stephenson joined the other members of the ship's crew as a castaway, and was rescued in August 1916.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

Stephenson is one of the lesser-known explorers in Antarctic history.  In the words of the ''Endurance'' crew's biographer, John F. Mann, "very little is recorded or known about his life, and of the 28 members of the ''Endurance'', he is perhaps the most mysterious."&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;  By 1914, he is believed to have been a veteran of the Royal Marines, who had served as an officer's [[Steward's Department|steward]].  Possibly before and certainly after his Antarctic service, Stephenson served for many years as a seaman on the [[fishing trawlers]] that put out from the Yorkshire coast to the fishing banks of the [[North Sea]].  Despite his sea experience, he occupied a humble space on the ''Endurance'', and few of the diaries and journals kept by his shipmates mention him or flesh out his character.  One tiny fragment of information indicates that although William Stephenson's nickname in civilian life was "Bill", he was known on the ''Endurance'' as "Steve".  Press coverage of Stephenson's dramatic rescue from the Antarctic in August 1916 appears to have been confined to the printing of his name on a manifest listing the passengers on a steamboat marking the final stage of their return to England in late 1916.  Stephenson lived in obscurity until his death in hospital in Hull in August 1953.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;              

==Legacy==
With his fellow fireman-stoker [[Ernest Holness]], William Stephenson was one of four members of the ''Endurance'' crew to be denied the Polar Medal.  The reasons, if any, for expedition leader Shackleton's failure to recommend Stephenson for this honor are unknown.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;
