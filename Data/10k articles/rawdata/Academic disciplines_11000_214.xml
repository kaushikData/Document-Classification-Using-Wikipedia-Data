The '''African Institute for Mathematical Sciences''' ('''AIMS''') is a tertiary education and research institute in [[Muizenberg]], South Africa, established in September 2003, and an associated network of linked institutes in Senegal, Ghana, Cameroon, Tanzania and Rwanda.

== History ==

=== Founder ===
The first African Institute for Mathematical Sciences was founded in Cape Town by [[Neil Turok]] in 2003, while he was Chair of Mathematical Physics at [[Cambridge University]]. Neil Turok is the son of [[Ben Turok]], an [[African National Congress|ANC]] MP. In 2008 Turok became Executive Director of the [[Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics]].

AIMS South Africa was formed as a partnership between the following universities: [[Stellenbosch University|University of Stellenbosch]], [[University of Cambridge]], [[University of Cape Town]], [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Paris-Sud]], and [[University of the Western Cape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aims.ac.za/en/about/about-aims|title=About AIMS|publisher=AIMS South Africa|accessdate=8 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908201619/https://www.aims.ac.za/en/about/about-aims|archive-date=8 September 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AIMS Next Einstein Initiative ===
AIMS was the subject of a talk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/neil_turok_makes_his_ted_prize_wish|title=TED talk about AIMS, by Neil Turok|date=|publisher=TED}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Neil Turok]] after he received the [[TED Prize]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ted.com/ted_prize_2008_1/|title=TED Prize 2008: Dave Eggers and Tutoring, Neil Turok and the next African Einstein, Karen Armstrong and the Charter for Compassion|date=28 February 2008|publisher=TED}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neil Turok's TED wish was that, within his lifetime, an African Einstein would be celebrated.

The AIMS Next Einstein Initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nexteinstein.org|title=AIMS-NextEinstein Initiative|date=21 January 2010|publisher=Nexteinstein.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a plan to create 15 more AIMS centres across Africa. These centres intend to create institutions that are equipped with educational and scientific resources equivalent to the more developed continents, in order to fulfil Neil Turok's TED wish.

The first three centres created after that in South Africa are in Senegal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aims-senegal.sn/|title=AIMS-Senegal|date=4 May 2013|publisher=Aims-senegal.sn|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926215517/http://www.aims-senegal.sn/|archivedate=26 September 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghana&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aims.edu.gh//|title=AIMS-Ghana|date=|publisher=AIMS-Ghana|access-date=11 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728045124/http://www.aims.edu.gh/|archive-date=28 July 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cameroon.  AIMS Senegal became operational in September, 2011 in Mbour, near Dakar, and AIMS Ghana opened its doors in 2012 in the small coastal city of Biriwa. An earlier centre based at the African University of Science and Technology (AUST&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aust-abuja.org/|title=African University of Science and Technology|date=|publisher=Aust-abuja.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020170941/http://aust-abuja.org/|archivedate=20 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in Nigeria was known as AIMS Abuja&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/34836|title=Seeking an African Einstein|date=|publisher=Physicsworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tedprize.org/aims-abuja-opens/|title=AIMS Abuja Opens|date=|publisher=Tedprize.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403000731/http://www.tedprize.org/aims-abuja-opens/|archivedate=3 April 2012|deadurl=yes|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a while. AIMS Ghana was set up in 2012, AIMS Cameroon in 2013 and AIMS Tanzania in 2014. There is a sixth centre in Rwanda.

The AIMS Next Einstein Initiative is a continuation of the work of the African Mathematical Institutes Network (AMI-Net).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nepadst.org/platforms/aminet.shtml|title=African Mathematical Institutes Network|date=|publisher=Nepadst.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After AIMS South Africa won the TED Prize in 2008, Neil Turok and his partners developed the AIMS Next Einstein Initiative, the goal of which is to build 15 centres of excellence across Africa by 2023. The Government of Canada made a US$20 million investment in the Next Einstein Initiative in 2010, through its [[International Development Research Centre]], and numerous governments in Africa and Europe have followed suit. In October 2015, a forum took place in Dakar under the auspices of UNESCO’s International Basic Sciences Programme to take the project for a vast network of centres to the next stage.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Southern Africa.

'''Animal studies''' is a recently recognized field in which animals are studied in a variety of cross-disciplinary ways. Scholars who engage in animal studies may be formally trained in a number of diverse fields, including [[geography]], [[art history]], [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[film studies]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[psychology]], [[literary studies]], [[museology]], [[philosophy]], communication, and [[sociology]]. They may engage with questions about literal animals, or about notions of "animality" or "brutality," employing various theoretical perspectives, including [[feminism]], [[Marxist theory]], and [[queer theory]]. Using these perspectives, those who engage in animal studies seek to understand both human-animal relations now and in the past, and to understand animals as beings-in-themselves, separate from our knowledge of them. Because the field is still developing, scholars and others have some freedom to define their own criteria about what issues may structure the field.

==History==
As an interdisciplinary subject, animal studies exists at the intersection of a number of different fields of study. Different fields began to turn to animals as an important topic at different times and for various reasons, and these separate disciplinary histories shape how scholars approach animal studies.

In part, animal studies developed out of the [[animal liberation movement]] and was grounded in [[ethics|ethical]] questions about co-existence with other species: whether it is moral to eat animals, to do scientific research on animals for human benefit, and so on. Animal studies scholars who explore the field from an ethical perspective frequently cite [[Australian]] philosopher [[Peter Singer]]'s 1975 work, ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'',&lt;ref name="Gorman"&gt;{{cite web |author=Gorman, James |date=12 January 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/science/animal-studies-move-from-the-lab-to-the-lecture-hall.html?pagewanted=all |title=Animal Studies Move From the Lab to the Lecture Hall |publisher=The New York Times |access-date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a founding document in animal studies.  Singer's work followed [[Jeremy Bentham#Animal rights|Jeremy Bentham]]'s by trying to expand [[utilitarian]] questions about pleasure and pain beyond humans to other [[sentience|sentient]] creatures.

Theorists interested in the role of animals in literature, culture, and [[Continental philosophy]] also consider the late work of [[Jacques Derrida]] a driving force behind the rise of interest in animal studies in the humanities.&lt;ref name="Gorman" /&gt;  Derrida's final lecture series, ''The Animal That Therefore I Am'', examined how interactions with animal life affect human attempts to define humanity and the self through language. Taking up Derrida's deconstruction and extending it to other cultural territory, [[Cary Wolfe]] published ''Animal Rites'' in 2003 and critiqued earlier animal rights philosophers such as [[Peter Singer]] and Thomas Regan. Wolfe's study points out an insidious humanism at play in their philosophies and others. Recently also the Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] published a book on the question of the animal: ''The Open. Man and Animal''.

==Research topics and methodologies==
Researchers in animal studies examine the questions and issues that arise when traditional modes of [[Humanities|humanistic]] and [[Science|scientific]] inquiry begin to take animals seriously as subjects of thought and activity.  Students of animal studies may examine how humanity is defined in relation to animals, or how representations of animals create understandings (and misunderstandings) of other species. In order to do so, animal studies pays close attention to the ways that humans [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] animals, and asks how humans might avoid bias in observing other creatures. For instance, [[Donna Haraway]]'s book, ''Primate Visions'', examines how [[diorama]]s created for the [[American Museum of Natural History]] showed family groupings that conformed to the traditional human [[nuclear family]], which misrepresented the animals' observed behavior in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Donna |last=Haraway |authorlink=Donna_Haraway |jstor=466593 |title=Teddy Bear Patriarchy: Taxidermy in the Garden of Eden, New York City, 1908–1936 |journal=Social Text |issue=11 |date=Winter 1984–1985 |pages=20–64 |publisher=Duke University Press |doi = 10.2307/466593}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical approaches in animal studies have also considered representations of non-human animals in popular culture, including species diversity in animated films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Becoming-Animal Is A Trap For Humans |first=Timothy |last=Laurie |journal=Deleuze and the Non-Human |year=2015 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912960}}, eds. Hannah Stark and Jon Roffe.&lt;/ref&gt;

By highlighting these issues, animal studies strives to re-examine traditional [[Ethics|ethical]], [[Politics|political]], and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] categories in the context of a renewed attention to and respect for animal life. The assumption that focusing on animals might clarify human knowledge is neatly expressed in [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s famous dictum that animals are "good to think."&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. ''Totemism''. Boston: Beacon Press, 1963, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rytidosperma longifolium33 floret19 (9412598806).jpg|thumb|Awns on the fruit of an Australian species of grass]]


In [[botany]], an '''awn''' is either a hair- or bristle-like appendage on a larger structure, or in the case of the [[Asteraceae]], a stiff needle-like element of the [[pappus (flower structure)|pappus]].

Awns are characteristic of various plant families, including [[Geraniaceae]] and many [[grass]]es ([[Poaceae]]). 

==Description==
In grasses awns typically extend from the [[lemma (botany)|lemma]]s of the [[floret]]s. This often makes the hairy appearance of the grass [[Inflorescence#Compound inflorescences|synfloresce]]. Awns may be long (several centimeters) or short, straight or curved, single or multiple per floret. Some [[genera]] are named after their awns, such as the [[three-awn]]s (''Aristida'').

In some [[species]], the awns can contribute significantly to [[photosynthesis]], as, for example, in [[barley]].

The awns of wild [[emmer]] wheat spikelets effectively [[self-cultivate]] by propelling themselves mechanically into [[soil]]s.  During a period of increased [[humidity]] during the night, the awns of the spikelet become erect and draw together, and in the process push the grain into the soil.  During the daytime the humidity drops and the awns slacken back again; however, fine [[silica]] hairs on the awns act as [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]] hooks in the soil and prevent the spikelets from reversing back out again.  During the course of alternating stages of daytime and nighttime humidity, the awns' pumping movements, which resemble a swimming [[frog kick]], drill the spikelet as much as an inch into the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Elbaum | first = Rivka | authorlink = |author2= Zaltzman, Liron|author3= Burgert, Ingo|author4= Fratzl, Peter | year = 2007 | month = | title = The Role of Wheat Awns in the Seed Dispersal Unit | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 316 | issue = 5826 | pages = 884&amp;ndash;886 | doi = 10.1126/science.1140097 | url = | accessdate = | quote =| pmid = 17495170 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When awns occur in the Geraniaceae, they form the distal (rostral) points of the five carpels, lying parallel in the style above the ovary. Depending on the species, such awns have various seed dispersal functions, either dispersing the seed by flinging it out (seed ejection); flinging away the entire carpel so that it snaps off (carpel projection);&lt;ref&gt;Yeo, P. F. (1984). "Fruit-discharge-type in Geranium (Geraniaceae): its use in classification and its evolutionary implications".

'''Blast fishing''' or '''dynamite fishing''' is the practice of using [[Explosive material|explosives]] to stun or kill schools of fish for easy collection. This often illegal practice can be extremely destructive to the surrounding [[ecosystem]], as the explosion often destroys the underlying habitat (such as [[coral reef]]s) that supports the fish.&lt;ref name="eoearth.org"&gt;[http://www.rareplanet.org/sites/rareplanet.org/files/notes_citation_cherry.doc McClellan, K., &amp; Bruno, J. (2008). Coral degradation through destructive fishing practices. ''Encyclopedia of Earth. Eds. Cutler J. Cleveland Washington, DC: Environmental Information Coalition, National Council for Science and the Environment''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The frequently improvised nature of the explosives used means danger for the fishermen as well, with accidents and injuries.

== Description ==
[[File:തോട്ട പൊട്ടിക്കൽ 01.jpg|thumb|Fish floating immediately after the blast.]]
Although outlawed, the practice remains widespread in [[Southeast Asia]], as well as in the [[Aegean Sea]], and coastal [[Africa]]. In the Philippines, where the practice has been well-documented,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tracc.00server.com/Fisheries/blast_fishing/economics.html Blast Fishing]&lt;/ref&gt; blast fishing was known prior to [[World War I]], as this activity is mentioned by [[Ernst Jünger]] in his book ''[[Storm of Steel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jünger, Ernst (2004 ed) [https://books.google.com/books?id=j3XNeuiucdoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA104&amp;dq=%22Storm+of+Steel%22+fishing&amp;ei=dayISYTRFo_ekwTq1PCRBg ''Storm of Steel''] Penguin Classics. Page 104. Translated by Michael Hofmann. {{ISBN|978-0-14-243790-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One 1999 report estimated that some 70,000 fishermen (12% of the Philippines' total fishermen) engaged in the practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oneocean.org/overseas/may99/a_closer_look_at_blast_fishing_in_the_philippines.html A Closer Look at Blast Fishing in the Philippines]&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive hard-to-patrol coastlines, the lure of lucrative, easy catches, and in some cases outright apathy or corruption on the part of local officials make enforcement of blast fishing bans an ongoing challenge for authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spc.int/Coastfish/News/lrf/8/LRF8-05-Pet.htm Destructive fishing mini symposium at the 9th International Coral Reef Symposium], Bali, Indonesia&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:തോട്ടയിൽ തിരിവയ്ക്കുന്നു 01.jpg|thumb|left|Explosives being prepared for blast fishing]]
Commercial [[dynamite]] or, more commonly, [[Improvised explosive device|homemade bombs]] constructed using a glass bottle with layers of powdered [[potassium nitrate]] and pebbles or an [[ANFO|ammonium nitrate and kerosene]] mixture are often employed. Such devices, though, may explode prematurely without warning, and have been known to injure or kill the person using them, or innocent bystanders.&lt;ref name="eoearth.org"/&gt;

Underwater shock waves produced by the explosion stun the fish and cause their [[swim bladder]]s to rupture.  This rupturing causes an abrupt loss of [[buoyancy]];  a small number of fish float to the surface, but most sink to the sea floor.  The explosions indiscriminately kill large numbers of fish and other marine organisms in the vicinity and can damage or destroy the physical environment, including extensive damage to coral reefs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stigmes.gr/br/brpages/articles/dinambr.htm Explosions In The Cretan Sea: The scourge of illegal fishing].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis JA (1996) [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA315490 "Effects of underwater explosions on life in the sea"] Australian Department of Defence, DSTO-GD-0080.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on coral reefs==
{{main|Coral reef}}

Researchers believe that destructive fishing practices like blast fishing are one of the biggest threats to the coral reef ecosystems. Blown up coral reefs are no more than rubble fields. The long-term impact associated with blast tanks is that there is no natural recovery of the reefs. Coral reefs are less likely to recover from constant disturbance such as blast fishing than from small disturbance that does not change the physical environment. Blast fishing destroys the calcium carbonate coral skeletons and is one of the continual disruptions of coral reefs.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, H. E., Pet, J. S., Dahuri, R., &amp; Caldwell, R. L. (2003). Recovery in rubble fields: long-term impacts of blast fishing. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 46(8), 1024-1031. Retrieved October 25, 2009, from ScienceDirect.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Indo-Pacific, the practice of blast fishing is a main cause of coral reef degradation. As a result, weakened rubble fields are formed and fish habitat is reduced.

The damaged coral reefs from blast fishing lead to instant declines in fish species wealth and quantity.&lt;ref&gt;Raymundo, L. J., Maypa, A. P., Gomez, E. D., &amp; Cadiz, P. (2007). Can dynamite-blasted reefs recover? A novel, low-tech approach to stimulating natural recovery in fish and coral populations. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 54(7), 1009-1019. Retrieved October 25, 2009, from ScienceDirect.&lt;/ref&gt; Explosives used in blast fishing not only kill fish but also destroy coral skeletons, creating unbalanced coral rubble. The elimination of the fish also eliminates the resilience of the coral reefs to climate change, further hindering their recovery. Single blasts cause reefs to recover over 5–10 years, while widespread blasting, as often practiced, transforms these biodiverse ecosystems into continuous unstable rubble.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, H. E., &amp; Caldwell, R. L. (2006). Recovery From Blast Fishing On Coral Reefs: A Tale of Two Scales. Ecological Applications, 16(5), 1631-1635. Retrieved October 25, 2009, from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Control ==

=== Community-based enforcement ===
In [[Tanzania]], one of the few methods to help manage blast fishing is a joint approach between fisheries officers and village committees.  Working together, they help the enforcement agencies recognize offenders by patrolling the sea as well as providing information collected in the local villages. As a result, this has assisted the enforcement agencies to reduce the occurrence of fish blasting from an average of 8 per day to zero. It has also provided sustainable funding to continue the efficient patrols, a certified planning institution, and suitable training and information to prosecutors and judges.

Similar patrols employed in Indonesia and Philippines have reduced the amount of blast fishing occurrences there. Based on dialogue with stakeholder groups in [[Southeast Asia]] and people of Tanzania and Philippines, it is evident that firmer enforcement is an effective strategy in managing blast fishing. Many countries have laws regarding blast fishing, but they are not fully implemented. Effective management of [[Marine Protected Area]]s (MPAs) is key in the patrolling of illegal fishing areas.

Besides patrols, the restricting or even banning of the sale of ammonium nitrate also makes it much more difficult to produce the explosives that are needed for blast fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=December 14, 2005|title=H.R. 3197, Security Handling Of Ammonium Nitrate|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-109hhrg35932/html/CHRG-109hhrg35932.htm|quote= Philippines, Colombia and ireland banning sale of ammonium nitrate to reduce production of explosives|accessdate=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach is not to restrict or ban the sale of ammonium nitrate, but instead log the people buying large quantities thereof.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/11/homeland-securi/ Tracking of buyers of ammonium nitrate]&lt;/ref&gt;

Centrally governed enforcement of blast fishing sometimes has limited success, due to resistance of local populations and mistrust of central governments. Bottom up systems based around clearly defined public benefits and education are more beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kusumawati|first=Ika|last2=Huang|first2=Hsiang-Wen|date=2015-01-01|title=Key factors for successful management of marine protected areas: A comparison of stakeholders׳ perception of two MPAs in Weh island, Sabang, Aceh, Indonesia|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X14002620|journal=Marine Policy|volume=51|pages=465–475|doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2014.09.029}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective MPAs have the backing of local leadership and populations due to clearly defined benefits of conservation/ecosystem services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heber Dunning|first=Kelly|date=2015-12-01|title=Ecosystem services and community based coral reef management institutions in post blast-fishing Indonesia|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212041614001491|journal=Ecosystem Services|volume=16|pages=319–332|doi=10.1016/j.ecoser.2014.11.010|hdl=1912/7847}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It has also been shown that effective MPAs have local stakeholders that have accurate perceptions of the environmental health of the region. When coastal residents believe that the ecosystem is healthier than indicators such as species diversity, population, and habitat distribution, they may be less likely to support the MPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garces|first=Len R.|last2=Pido|first2=Michael D.|last3=Tupper|first3=Mark H.|last4=Silvestre|first4=Geronimo T.|date=2013-09-01|title=Evaluating the management effectiveness of three marine protected areas in the Calamianes Islands, Palawan Province, Philippines: Process, selected results and their implications for planning and management|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569112001743|journal=Ocean &amp; Coastal Management|series=Special Issue: Advancing Ecosystem Based Management|volume=81|pages=49–57|doi=10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2012.07.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, effective blast fishing community control rely on education campaigns that bring awareness to the relationship between fish stock and fishing rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foale|first=Simon|last2=Manele|first2=Bruno|date=2004-12-01|title=Social and political barriers to the use of Marine Protected Areas for conservation and fishery management in Melanesia|journal=Asia Pacific Viewpoint|language=en|volume=45|issue=3|pages=373–386|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8373.2004.00247.x|issn=1467-8373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blast monitoring programs and eradication methods ===
This method involves seismic technology developed by the US Government for detecting underwater explosions. Re-adapted for use as background blast monitoring equipment Hong Kong in 1995, first installed in the north eastern waters. Fixed monitoring locations were established in 2006, notably one near to the Jockey Club HSBC WWF Hong Kong Hoi Ha Marine Life Centre. Data from these units were used for discussions with the Marine Police and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD). The emphasis for these discussions was placed on protection of the Marine Parks, the last Marine Park bombing occurred in Hoi Ha Wan Marine Park in October, 1999. With the assistance of community programs from NGO's, education awareness from the AFCD and dillegent patrols by the Marine Police Blast fishing was completely eradicated from Hong Kong waters in 2011.&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee.org"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chan|first1=Adrian|title=A systematic analysis of blast fishing in South-East Asia and possible solutions|journal=Underwater Technology 2017|pages=1–6|date=2017|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7890330/|doi=10.1109/UT.2017.7890330|isbn=978-1-5090-5266-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 background blast monitoring (BBM) with this same equipment was installed at Mabul Island in Sabah, Malaysia. In 2014 the Reef Defenders began an aggressive program to create a network of blast monitoring systems throughout South-East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reef Defenders|url=https://thereefdefenders.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; BBM is important to guide community based eradication programs, data collected shows that with the use of community based programs in tandem with BBM, the levels of blast fishing can be reduce by up to 90%.&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee.org"/&gt; This has already been observed in multiple areas, more importantly there is a significant reduction in other destructive fishing methods, shown by recovery in fish stocks.

=== Indonesia ===

Blast fishing in [[Indonesia]] has been around for over fifty years and continues to transform its one-of-a-kind coral reefs into desolate gray moonscapes, as fishermen continue to use explosives or cyanide to kill or stun their prey. Dive operators and [[conservationists]] say Indonesia is not doing enough to protect the waters off the [[Komodo Island]]s. They say enforcement declined following the exit of a U.S.-based conservation group that helped fight destructive fishing practices. Coral Gardens that were among Asia's most spectacular dive sites, were the latest victim of bomb blasting despite being located inside the [[Komodo National Park]], a 500,000-acre reserve and [[World Heritage Site|U.N.

While previously Komodo was relatively protected by a cooperative undertaking with TNC (The Nature Conservancy) since the Indonesian government has assumed responsibility for park protection, there has been an upsurge in bombing. During a recent visit to Crystal Boommie, it was found to be 60% destroyed, with freshly overturned coral tables proving recent bombing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2000/NATURE/11/07/blast.fishing.enn/index.html Fishermen blast premier dive sites off Indonesia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421231136/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/04/20/fishermen-blast-premier-dive-sites-indonesia.html |date=April 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the market in the city of [[Makassar]], an estimated 10 to 40 percent of the fish are caught in this manner. The local fishermen find the technique to be easier and more productive than traditional methods. The goal for the country has been to implement stricter policies and fisheries management programs to limit the killing of the fish as well as the destruction to the marine ecosystem. Forty years ago, blast fishing was practiced with [[dynamite]] which was in plentiful supply after [[World War II]]. Today, fishermen mostly use homemade bombs that are made from bottles filled with an explosive mixture; weights are also added to make the bottle sink faster underwater. After the bomb explodes, the fish killed or stunned by the [[shock wave]] from the explosion are collected.&lt;ref&gt;Pet-Soede, L., &amp; Erdmann, M. V. (1998).

=== Philippines ===
A 1987 study concluded that blast fishing was then very widespread in the Philippines, estimating that 25% of all municipal fish landings (equivalent to 250,000 metric tons per year) were from blast fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James B. Marsh|title=Resources &amp; Environment in Asia's Marine Sector|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7RWfiECRgC8C|year=1992|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-8448-1708-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7RWfiECRgC8C&amp;pg=PA153 153]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the blast fishing is however done in the south, near Palawan and the south China Sea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reefbase.org/resource_center/publication/main.aspx?refid=11288 Dynamite fishing mostly concentrated in the south]&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in 2002 reported that destructive fishing methods had caused the degradation of about 70% of Philippine coral reefs and reduced annual fisheries production by about 177,500 metric tons in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Ann Palma|author2=Martin Tsamenyi|author3=William R.

In 2010, mayor Nino Rey Boniel of [[Bien Unido, Bohol|Bien Unido]] town in the province of [[Bohol]], [[Philippines]], built an underwater [[grotto]] along the [[Danajon Islet|Danajon]] reef which deteriorated due to excessive [[dynamite]] and [[cyanide]] use. Through the help of [[Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight|Sea Knights]] and Boholano divers, two 14-foot statues of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mother Mary]] and Santo Nino ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for [[Child Jesus|Holy Child]]) were placed on 8 September and 18 October 2010 respectively, 60 feet below sea level in order to discourage fishermen from using illegal and destructive methods in fishing and hopefully remind everyone that the sea and its inhabitants are gifts from God that deserves to be treasured and taken care of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seaknights.com/underwater-grotto-bohol.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424043504/http://www.seaknights.com/underwater-grotto-bohol.html |archivedate=2014-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/lifestyle/11/07/10/praying-underwater-bohol | title=Praying underwater in Bohol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the director of the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources declared an “all-out war” against dynamite fishing and other illegal fishing practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/152341/bfar-declares-war-vs-dynamite-fishing|title=BFAR declares war vs dynamite fishing|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tanzania ===
In northern Tanzania, blast fishing, which is illegal, has resurfaced in recent years as a key danger to its coral reefs.  This has occurred even though major institutions like local communities and the district government have been put in place for enhanced fisheries management.  The damage of blast fishing in the area has contributed to unstable coral reefs, discouragement of tourism investors, and a threat to the habitat of [[coelacanth]]s in the region.  Other impacts of blast fishing in the area include reports that citizens have died or lost limbs due to the blasting. The northern part of the country has many beautiful beaches and uninhabited islands. However, many investors feel and tourists are discouraged due to the fish blasting.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, S. (2009). Dynamite fishing in northern Tanzania – pervasive, problematic and yet preventable. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 58(1), 20-23. Retrieved October 25, 2009, from ScienceDirect.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tanzania, coral reefs are essential for both ecological and socio-economic reasons. They are full of fish, [[lobsters]], [[prawns]], [[crabs]], [[octopuses]], [[mollusks]], and [[sea cucumbers]]. In addition, coral reefs are one of the major tourist attractions in Tanzania. The coastal tourism provides a living for the people as well as foreign currency for the country.  However, there has been an increase in the people living along the coast which has led to a large demand for fisheries. It has led to [[overexploitation]] and [[destructive fishing practices]]. Blast fishing has been practised in Tanzania since the 1960s. It was during the 1980s and 1990s that blast fishing was at its peak in Tanzania. For example, in Mnazi bay, [[Mtwara]], 441 blasts were recorded in two months in 1996, and 100 blasts were witnessed through one six-our period in Mpovi reef.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, G. M. (2004).

== Inefficiency  ==
Despite the effectiveness in killing or stunning the fish another problem with blast fishing is the inefficiency of retrieval. For every 10 fish killed only one or two float to the surface due to damage caused to the internal air bladders of the fish. The rest sink to the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;Dynamite Fishing With Jacque Coustaeu&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4895">'''Bletting''' is a process of softening that certain fleshy [[fruit]]s undergo, beyond [[ripening]]. There are some fruits that are either sweeter after some bletting, such as [[sea buckthorn]], or for which most varieties can be eaten raw only after bletting, such as [[Mespilus germanica|medlars]], [[persimmon]]s, [[quince]], [[service tree]] fruit, and [[wild service tree]] fruit ("chequers"). The [[rowan]] or mountain ash fruit must be bletted and cooked to be edible, to break down the toxic [[parasorbic acid]] (hexenollactone) into [[sorbic acid]].{{clarify|reason=Service tree and Wild Service tree are already mentioned; is this the case with those species of Sorbus? A citation would be helpful.|date=January 2012}}

[[File:Mespilus germanica 01.jpg|thumb|right|Ripe (bletted) and unripe [[Mespilus germanica|medlars]]]]
Chemically speaking, bletting brings about an increase in [[sugar]]s and a decrease in the [[acid]]s and [[tannin]]s that make the unripe fruit astringent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Glew, R.H. |author2=Ayaz, F.A. |author3=Sanz, C. |author4=VanderJagt, D.J. |author5=Huang, H.S. |author6=Chuang, L.T. |author7=Strnad, M. |year=2003|title=Changes in sugars, organic acids and amino acids in medlar (''Mespilus germanica'' L.) during fruit development and maturation|journal=Food Chemistry|volume=83|issue=3|pages=363–369|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T6R-48JCF0M-7/2/3402a603fc264ec58884940032c62424|doi=10.1016/s0308-8146(03)00097-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rop, O. |author2=Sochor, J. |author3=Jurikova, T. |author4=Zitka, O. |author5=Skutkova, H. |author6=Mlcek, J. |author7=Salas, P. |author8=Krska, B. |author9=Babula, P. |author10=Adam, V. |author11=Kramarova, D. |author12=Beklova, M. |author13=Provaznik, I. |author14=Kizek, R. |year=2011|title=Effect of Five Different Stages of Ripening on Chemical Compounds in Medlar (''Mespilus germanica'' L.)|journal=Molecules|volume=16|issue=74-91|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/16/1/74/pdf | doi = 10.3390/molecules16010074 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ripe medlars, for example, are taken from the tree, placed somewhere cool, and allowed to ripen for several weeks. In ''Trees and Shrubs'', horticulturist [[F. A. Bush]] wrote about medlars that "if the fruit is wanted it should be left on the tree until late October and stored until it appears in the first stages of decay; then it is ready for eating. More often the fruit is used for making jelly." Ideally, the fruit should be harvested from the tree immediately following a hard frost, which starts the bletting process by breaking down [[cell wall]]s and speeding softening.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

Once the process is complete, the medlar flesh will have broken down enough that it can be spooned out of the skin. The taste of the sticky, mushy substance has been compared to sweet dates and dry applesauce, with a hint of cinnamon. In ''Notes on a Cellar-Book'', the great English [[oenophile]] [[George Saintsbury]] called bletted medlars the "ideal fruit to accompany wine."

== History ==
The [[English language|English]] verb ''[[wikt:blet|to blet]]'' was [[neologism|coined]] by [[John Lindley]], in his ''Introduction to [[Botany]]'' (1835). He derived it from the French ''poire blette'' meaning 'overripe [[pear]]'. "After the period of ripeness," he wrote, "most fleshy fruits undergo a new kind of alteration; their flesh either rots or blets."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=John|last=Lindley|year=1835 |title=Introduction to Botany |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=534EAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA296&amp;lpg=PA296&amp;dq=%22May+I+be+forgiven+for+coining+a+word+to+express+that+peculiar+bruised+appearance%22 |p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', he alluded to bletting when he wrote (IV. iii. 167) "They would have married me to the rotten Medler." [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]] also draws a misogynistic comparison in his play [[The Honest Whore]]: "I scarce know her, for the beauty of her cheek hath, like the moon, suffered strange eclipses since I beheld it: women are like medlars – no sooner ripe but rotten." Elsewhere in literature, [[D. H. Lawrence]] dubbed medlars "wineskins of brown morbidity."

There is also an old saying, used in ''[[Don Quixote]]'', that "time and straw make the medlars ripe," referring to the bletting process.

A '''Chemist In Training''' ('''CIT''') is a [[Canada|Canadian]] designation for someone who has obtained a [[academic degree|degree]] from an accredited institution that qualifies for registration with one of the provincial or territorial chemical professional associations,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pchem.ca&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocq.qc.ca/fr/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102101620/http://www.ocq.qc.ca/fr/ |archivedate=2009-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acpo.on.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; but has not yet achieved the additional requirements (like relevant supervised work experience) to become accredited as a [[Professional Chemist]] (P.Chem.).

==Licensure==
A licensed CIT is certified to work in a [[chemistry]] profession. Upon completing a certain amount of work experience under the supervision of a Licensed Professional Chemist (P.Chem.) as determined by a [[licensing board]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pchem.ca&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocq.qc.ca/fr/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102101620/http://www.ocq.qc.ca/fr/ |archivedate=2009-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acpo.on.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; a CIT is then eligible to gain experience by supervision from a P.Chem.

While being a certified CIT may help in obtaining a chemistry related job, it is not typically required to do chemistry work. All work performed by an CIT must still be checked and certified by a P.Chem.

The corresponding ceremony using cohoba-laced [[tobacco]] is transliterated as cojibá.  This corresponds culturally to the practice of drug-induced "astral traveling" so common to the Americas and elsewhere.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3881">'''Computer science and engineering''' (CSE) is an academic program at some [[University|universities]] that integrates the fields of [[computer engineering]] and [[computer science]]. It is a sub-field of [[electronics engineering]], covering only the digital aspects of electronics engineering, specializing in hardware-systems areas like [[computer architecture]], [[processor design]], [[supercomputer|high-performance computing]], [[parallel computing|parallel processing]], [[computer networks]] and [[embedded systems]]. CSE programs also include core subjects of computer science such as [[operating systems]], [[theory of computation]], design and analysis of [[algorithm]]s, [[data structures]] and [[database|database systems]]. The program aims at designing, developing and troubleshooting [[computing|computing devices]] (such as [[personal computers]], [[supercomputers]], [[robots]], [[smartphones]], [[networking devices]], [[embedded devices]]), focusing the underlying fundamental issues (like processor architecture design, operating system design, [[memory management]], [[digital system]] design, [[communication protocol]] design, [[software development]] and [[database management]]) in the most efficient and effective way.

Computer science programs typically centers primarily around theory and software, with only some hardware&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/undergraduate/overview/|title=Overview of the Degree Programs - Computer Science|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;; upper division courses tend to allow a lot of freedom to specialize in software and theory related areas (e.g. [[algorithms]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[cryptography]]/security, [[computer graphics|graphics]]/[[scientific visualization|visualization]], [[numerical analysis|numerical]] and [[symbolic computation|symbolic computing]], [[operating systems]]/[[distributed processing]], [[software engineering]]).

Computer engineering programs tend to resemble computer science at the lower division with similar introductory programming and math courses, but diverges from computer science at the upper division with heavy electrical engineering requirements (e.g. [[digital electronics|digital]] and [[analogue electronics|analog]] circuits, [[integrated circuit design]], [[VLSI]] design and [[control systems]]. Despite the overlap with computer science at the lower division level, computer engineering skews much more heavily toward the electronics side that it has more in common with [[electrical engineering]].

Computer Science and Engineering integrates all of the above and is intended to develop a solid understanding of the entire machine ([[computer hardware]] and [[software]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.ucdavis.edu/programs/ECS/ECSprog.html|title=UC Davis General Catalog - Computer Science and Engineering - The Program|website=catalog.ucdavis.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher unit count required to complete the program often means that a CSE student will need to spend an extra year in university.

Although Computer Science and Engineering is the common designation for the combined program, some universities (such as [[UC Berkeley|Berkeley]] and [[MIT]]) deviate by calling their program ''Electrical Engineering and Computer Science'' (EECS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/electrical-engineering-computer-sciences|title=Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Sciences|date=11 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore, there are some universities (such as [[University of California, Irvine|UCI]] and [[UC Merced]]) that named their department EECS and the program housed within CSE.

The '''conservation-restoration of the Shroud of Turin''' refers to the [[conservation-restoration]] and enduring preservation of the [[Shroud of Turin]] to avoid further damage and contamination. Since 1578 the Shroud has been kept in the Royal [[Chapel]] of [[Turin Cathedral]] (from 1694 to 1993 the Shroud rested in the Royal Chapel's Bertola [[altar]]), under the [[laminated glass|laminated]] [[bulletproof glass]] of the airtight case.&lt;ref name="TS"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The temperature and humidity controlled-case is filled with [[argon]] (99.5%) and [[oxygen]] (0.5%) to prevent chemical changes, the Shroud itself is kept on an [[aluminum]] support sliding on runners and stored flat within the case.&lt;ref name="TS"/&gt;

==Public showings==
When the Shroud is not on public display, the case is closed; during the public display the case can be moved, raised and opened. During the last centuries, the Shroud has been publicly exhibited a limited number of times,&lt;ref&gt;

==Restorations==
On 4 December 1532, the Shroud sustained a fire, which burned out several holes in the fabric. In the spring of 1534, the [[Poor Clare Nuns]] patched the holes and placed a backing [[Holland cloth]] on the reverse.

On 11 April 1997, the Turin Cathedral sustained another fire, but the Shroud survived entirely unscathed. By that time the Shroud stayed within the three walls of [[plate glass]] each {{convert|11|ft|m}} long and {{convert|6.5|ft|m}} high. The fireman Mario Trematore decided to use a [[sledgehammer]] against the bulletproof glass to rescue the relic. Eventually he caused the 39mm thick material to shatter and another fireman arrived to help Trematore. When asked how he managed to break the glass, Trematore replied: "The bulletproof glass can stop bullets, but it cannot stop the strength of values represented by the symbol inside it. With only a hammer and our hands (still bleeding), we broke the glass".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2002 restoration, conducted by the Commission for the Conservation of the Shroud between 20 June and 22 July, thirty triangular patches, sewn by nuns in 1534, as well as the Holland cloth, were removed. The pre-1516/pre-1192 L-shaped burn holes, called "poker holes" and mentioned in the 12th century ''[[Hungarian Pray Codex]]'', have remained. The 2002 restoration has been criticized for the damage it caused to the Shroud.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Meacham]], "The Rape of the Turin Shroud", 2005, {{ISBN|1-4116-5769-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural hazards==
Because of [[dehydration]], which might have been involved in the [[Shroud of Turin#Possible means of image formation|image formation]], the Shroud was not recommended to be stored in [[vacuum]].&lt;ref name="ST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shroud.com/adler1.htm|title=Conservation Of The Shroud of Turin|publisher =Shroud Spectrum International, No. 42, December 1993|author=Alan D. Adler, Larry A. Schwalbe |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the minor changes of temperature can enhance the pressure, humidity and mechanical stress, the Shroud's case was made climate-controlled.

An [[electron microscope]] investigation of the dust and pollens removed from the Shroud during the 1978 examination has revealed that some species of [[mites]] are resident on the cloth.&lt;ref name="ST"/&gt; ''[[Lichenotheliaceae|Lichenothelia]]'' and [[arachnids]] in one of the tape samples have been also observed.&lt;ref name="ST"/&gt;
 
As the Shroud was rolled and unrolled for display throughout the centuries, it sustained a repeated [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] of the charred edges to the areas holed in the fire.&lt;ref name="CST"/&gt; The low magnification images of the blood areas already show an extensive abrasion of this type.&lt;ref name="ST"/&gt; To reduce the stress of [[gravity]] the Shroud was suggested being in horizontal display. To minimize possible [[cosmic ray]] exposure, it was also suggested that the plane of the cloth be aligned perpendicular to the ground.

American researcher Alan D. Adler, confirming the presence of [[bilirubin]] on the fabric, noted that it is not light-stable and may change the color under any light.&lt;ref name="CST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shroud.com/restored.htm|title=Comments On The Restoration|publisher = Shroud.com |author= |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Adler, since the image fibers are at or near saturation while the surrounding cloth is not, the latter will gradually get darker  until the image first becomes a silhouette and later finally vanishes.&lt;ref name="CST"/&gt;

'''Continuous monitoring and adaptive control''' (CMAC) is a category of [[stormwater]] [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practice]] that allows for a wider range of operation of [[detention pond|detention]] and [[retention pond|retention]] ponds. CMAC systems typically consist of a [[piezometer|water level sensor]], an [[butterfly valve|actuated valve]], and an internet connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Jamie Lefkowitz, Alexa Sarmanian, and Marcus Quigley |title=Continuous monitoring and adaptive control—the internet of things transforms stormwater management |url=http://www.newea.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NEWEA-Journal_Spr16.pdf#page=25 |work=Journal of the New England Water Environment Association |issn=1077-3002 |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=44–51 |date=Spring 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5458">In [[electrical engineering]], '''current limiting reactors''' can reduce [[short-circuit]] [[Electric current|current]]s, which result from plant expansions and power source additions, to levels that can be adequately handled by existing distribution equipment.&lt;ref name="Source 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Simpson|first=James|title=The how and why of current-limiting reactors|url=http://business.highbeam.com/2095/article-1G1-14794605/and-why-currentlimiting-reactors|work=Highbeam Business|publisher=EC&amp;M Electrical Construction &amp; Maintenance|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They can also be used in high voltage electric power transmission grids for a similar purpose. In the control of electric motors, current limiting reactors can be used to restrict starting current or as part of a speed control system.
[[File:NoxonReactor.jpg|thumb|right| A set of air-core reactors installed outdoors at a substation. Similar reactors are used for current limiting at transmission and distribution voltage levels.]]

== History ==
Current limiting reactors, once called current limiting [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] coils, were first presented in 1915.&lt;ref name="Source 4"&gt;{{cite conference |title=The Use of Current-Limiting Reactors |first1=Walter Melville |last1=Dann |first2=H. H. |last2=Rudd |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nnc1.cu55816380;page=root;view=image;size=100;seq=5;num=1 |conference=Meeting of the Society of Mechanical, Electrical, and Steam Engineers |location=Boody House, [[Toledo, Ohio]] |date=June 17–18, 1915 |accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The inventor of the current limiting reactance coil was Vern E. Alden who filed the patent on November 20, 1917 with an issue date of September 11, 1923. The original assignee was [[Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company]].&lt;ref name="Source 5"&gt;{{cite patent |inventor-last=Alden |inventor-first=Vern |country=US |number=1467771 |title=Current Limiting Reactance Coil |assign=Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company |gdate=September 11, 1923 |url=http://www.google.com/patents/US1467771 |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==
A current limiting reactor is used when the [[prospective short-circuit current]] in a distribution or transmission system is calculated to exceed the [[interrupting rating]] of the associated [[switchgear]].  The inductive reactance is chosen to be low enough for an acceptable voltage drop during normal operation, but high enough to restrict a short circuit to the rating of the switchgear. 
The amount of protection that a current limiting reactor offers depends upon the percentage increase in impedance that it provides for the system.&lt;ref name="Source 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Current Limiting Reactors: Technical Overview and Measurement Procedures|url=http://www.nwl.com/files/file/Tech%20Bulletins/222.pdf|publisher=NWL|accessdate=17 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303231851/http://www.nwl.com/files/file/Tech%20Bulletins/222.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Current Limiting Reactor.jpg|thumb|Current Limiting Reactor]]

The main motive of using current limiting reactors is to reduce short-circuit currents so that circuit breakers with lower short circuit breaking capacity can be used. They can also be used to protect other system components from high current levels and to limit the inrush current when starting a large motor.&lt;ref name="Source 3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Quality Power|url=http://www.qualitypower.co.in/current-reactors.php|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
It is desirable that the reactor does not go into magnetic saturation during a short-circuit, so generally an air-core [[electromagnetic coil|coil]] is used. At low and medium voltages, air-insulated coils are practical; for high transmission voltages, the coils may be immersed in [[transformer oil]]. 
Installation of air-core coils requires consideration of the magnetic field produced by the coils, which may induce current in large nearby metal objects. This may result in objectionable temperature rise and waste of energy.&lt;ref&gt;"Electrical Transmission and Distribution Reference Book", Westinghouse Electr Corporation, Pittsburgh PA , 1950 pp. 133-135&lt;/ref&gt;

==Line reactor==
A '''line reactor''' is an inductor wired between a power source and a load.  In addition to the current limiting function, the device serves to filter out spikes of current &lt;ref&gt;http://www.myronzucker.com/linereactorpg1.html What is a Line Reactor?&lt;/ref&gt;  and may also reduce injection of harmonic currents into the power supply.  The most common type is designed for [[three-phase electric power]], in which three isolated inductors are each wired in series with one of the three line phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cosphi.com/line-load-reactor-applications.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228061844/http://www.cosphi.com/line-load-reactor-applications.html |archivedate=2012-12-28 |df= }} Line reactor configurations&lt;/ref&gt; Line reactors are generally installed in motor driven equipment to limit starting current, and may be used to protect [[Variable-frequency drive]]s and motors.:&lt;ref&gt;http://ecmweb.com/mag/electric_line_reactors_vfds/&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Dramatic structure''' is the structure of a [[drama]]tic work such as a [[Play (theater)|play]] or [[film]]. Many scholars have analyzed dramatic structure, beginning with [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE). This article looks at Aristotle's analysis of the Greek tragedy and on [[Gustav Freytag]]'s analysis of [[Theater of ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespearean]] drama.

==History==
In his ''Poetics'', the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher Aristotle put forth the idea the play should imitate a single whole action. "A whole is what has a beginning and middle and end" (1450b27).&lt;ref name="fall2"&gt;Perseus Digital Library (2006). [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1450b Aristotle, ''Poetics'']&lt;/ref&gt; He split the play into two parts: complication and unravelling.

The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] drama critic [[Horace]] advocated a 5-act structure in his [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]: "Neue minor neu sit quinto productior actu fabula" (lines 189–190) ("A play should not be shorter or longer than five acts").

The fourth-century Roman grammarian [[Aelius Donatus]] defined the play as a three part structure, the [[protasis]], [[epitasis]], and [[Catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]]).

In 1863, around the time that playwrights like [[Henrik Ibsen]] were abandoning the 5-act structure and experimenting with 3 and 4-act plays, the [[Germany|German]] playwright and novelist Gustav Freytag wrote ''Die Technik des Dramas'', a definitive study of the 5-act dramatic structure, in which he laid out what has come to be known as Freytag's pyramid.&lt;ref name="fall3"&gt;University of South Carolina (2006). [http://home.earthlink.net/~mr.kilgore/102/handouts/bigpicture_what.htm The Big Picture] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023073242/http://home.earthlink.net/~mr.kilgore/102/handouts/bigpicture_what.htm |date=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Freytag's pyramid, the plot of a story consists of five parts: [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] (originally called introduction), [[rising action]] (rise), [[Climax (narrative)|climax]], [[falling action]] (return or fall), and [[dénouement]]/&lt;wbr&gt;[[wikt:resolution|resolution]]/&lt;wbr&gt;[[revelation]]/&lt;wbr&gt;[[catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]].&lt;ref name="fall4"&gt;University of Illinois: Department of English (2006).

==Aristotle's analysis==
Many structural principles still in use by modern storytellers were explained by Aristotle in his ''Poetics''. In the part that we still have, he mostly analyzed the tragedy. A part analyzing the comedy is believed to have existed but is now lost.

Aristotle stated that the tragedy should imitate a whole action, which means that the events follow each other by probability or necessity, and that the causal chain has a beginning and an end.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0009 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section VII]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a knot, a central problem that the protagonist must face. The play has two parts:  complication and unravelling.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0020 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section  XVIII]&lt;/ref&gt; During complication, the protagonist finds trouble as the knot is revealed or tied; during unraveling, the knot is resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0020 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section XVIII ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two types of [[Scene (drama)|scenes]] are of special interest:  the reversal, which throws the action in a new direction, and the recognition, meaning the protagonist has an important revelation.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0008 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section VI]&lt;/ref&gt;  Reversals should happen as a necessary and probable cause of what happened before, which implies that turning points needs to be properly set up.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0013 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section  XI]&lt;/ref&gt;

Complications should arise from a flaw in the protagonist. In the tragedy, this flaw will be his undoing.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0015 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section  XIII]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freytag's analysis&lt;!--'Dramatic arc' redirects here--&gt;==
[[File:Freytags pyramid.svg|thumb|250px|"Freytag's pyramid", symbolizing his theory of dramatic structure]]
According to Freytag, a drama is divided into five parts, or acts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freytag|first=Gustav|title=Die Technik des Dramas|year=1863|url=http://www.matoni.de/technik/tec_inh.htm|accessdate=2009-01-20|language=German|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116004731/http://www.matoni.de/technik/tec_inh.htm|archivedate=2009-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some refer to as a '''{{visible anchor|dramatic arc}}'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and dénouement. Freytag's Pyramid can help writers organize their thoughts and ideas when describing the main problem of the drama, the rising action, the climax and the falling action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Freytag's analysis of dramatic structure is based on five-act plays, it can be applied (sometimes in a modified manner) to short stories and novels as well, making dramatic structure a [[literary element]]. Nonetheless, the pyramid is not always easy to use, especially in modern plays such as [[Alfred Uhry]]'s ''[[Driving Miss Daisy (play)|Driving Miss Daisy]]'' and  [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[The Crucible]]'', which is actually divided into 25 scenes without concrete acts.

===Exposition===
{{main article|Exposition (narrative)}}

The exposition is the portion of a story that introduces important background information to the audience; for example, information about the setting, events occurring before the main plot, characters' back stories, etc. Exposition can be conveyed through dialogues, flashbacks, characters' thoughts, background details, in-universe media, or the narrator telling a back-story.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=115-121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rising action===
In the rising action, a series of events build toward the point of greatest interest. The rising action of a story is the series of events that begin immediately after the exposition (introduction) of the story and builds up to the climax. These events are generally the most important parts of the story since the entire plot depends on them to set up the climax and ultimately the satisfactory resolution of the story itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=125-128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climax===
{{main article|Climax (narrative)}}

The climax is the turning point, which changes the protagonist's fate. If the story is a comedy and things were going badly for the protagonist, the plot will begin to unfold in his or her favor, often requiring  the protagonist to draw on hidden inner strengths.  If the story is a tragedy, the opposite state of affairs will ensue, with things going from good to bad for the protagonist, often revealing the protagonist's hidden weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=128-130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Falling action===
During the falling action, the conflict between the [[protagonist]] and the [[antagonist]] unravels, with the protagonist winning or losing against the antagonist. The falling action may contain a moment of final suspense, in which the final outcome of the conflict is in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=133-135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dénouement&lt;!--'Dénouement' redirects here--&gt;===
{{see also|Detective dénouement }}
The '''''dénouement'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ({{IPAc-en|UK|d|eɪ|ˈ|n|uː|m|ɒ̃|,_|d|ɪ|-}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|d|eɪ|n|uː|ˈ|m|ɒ̃}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/denouement?q=D%C3%A9nouement "dénouement"]. ''[[Cambridge Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|denumɑ̃|lang}}) comprises events from the end of the falling action to the actual ending scene of the drama or narrative. [[Conflict (narrative)|Conflict]]s are resolved, creating normality for the characters and a sense of [[catharsis]], or release of tension and anxiety, for the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=137-140}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Etymology|Etymologically]], the French word ''dénouement'' is derived from the word ''dénouer'', "to untie", from ''nodus'', Latin for "knot." It is the unraveling or untying of the complexities of a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The comedy ends with a ''dénouement'' (a conclusion), in which the protagonist is better off than at the story's outset. The tragedy ends with a catastrophe, in which the protagonist is worse off than at the beginning of the narrative. Exemplary of a comic ''dénouement'' is the final scene of [[Shakespeare]]’s comedy ''[[As You Like It]]'', in which couples marry, an evildoer repents, two disguised characters are revealed for all to see, and a ruler is restored to power. In Shakespeare's tragedies, the ''dénouement'' is usually the death of one or more characters.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Criticism==

Freytag's analysis was intended to apply to ancient Greek and Shakespearean drama, not modern.

Contemporary dramas increasingly use the fall to increase the relative height of the climax and dramatic impact ([[melodrama]]). The protagonist reaches up but falls and succumbs to doubts, fears, and limitations. The negative climax occurs when the protagonist has an epiphany and encounters the greatest fear possible or loses something important, giving the protagonist the courage to take on another obstacle. This confrontation becomes the classic climax.&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;Teruaki Georges Sumioka: The Grammar of Entertainment Film 2005, {{ISBN|978-4-8459-0574-4}}; [http://www.hi-ho.ne.jp/sumioka-info/resouce/resouce.html lectures at Johannes-Gutenberg-University in German]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:EISCAT dish Kiruna.JPG|right|thumb|EISCAT Kiruna Radar (diameter 32m)]]

'''EISCAT''' ('''European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association''') operates three [[incoherent scatter]] [[radar]] systems, at 224&amp;nbsp;MHz, 931&amp;nbsp;MHz in Northern [[Scandinavia]] and one at 500&amp;nbsp;MHz on [[Svalbard]], used to study the interaction between the [[Sun]] and the [[Earth]] as revealed by disturbances in the [[ionosphere]] and [[magnetosphere]]. At the Ramfjordmoen facility (near [[Tromsø]], [[Norway]]), it also operates an [[ionospheric heater]] facility, similar to [[HAARP]]. Additional receiver stations are located in [[Sodankylä]], [[Finland]], and [[Kiruna]], [[Sweden]]. The '''EISCAT Svalbard radar''' ('''ESR''') is located in [[Longyearbyen]], Norway. The EISCAT Headquarters are also located in [[Kiruna]].

EISCAT is funded and operated by research institutes and research councils of [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Japan]], [[China]] and the [[United Kingdom]] (the EISCAT Associates). Institutes in other countries also contribute to operations, including [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Germany]] and [[South Korea]].

The system was also tested for [[space debris]] [[space surveillance|tracking]] and the radars were proven to be capable of statistical observations of [[Low-Earth orbit]] (LEO) debris (altitudes of 500 to 1500&amp;nbsp;km) down to 2&amp;nbsp;cm in size. Since these measurements are insufficient to determine complete [[orbit]]s, the radar has only limited space surveillance value.&lt;ref name=bulletin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bulletin133/bul133f_klinkrad.pdf|title=Europe's Eyes on the Skies|publisher=[[ESA]]|access-date=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the space debris tracking change is only a dedicated back-end computer system, the primary EISCAT observations are not compromised. As a result of that, the EISCAT radars allow continuous monitoring of the LEO debris in a [[beam park]] mode, functioning as a space surveillance system part of the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Space Situational Awareness Programme]] (SSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Debris/Scanning_observing |title=ESA - Space Debris - Scanning &amp; observing|publisher=ESA|access-date=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1973, the EISCAT proposal&amp;nbsp;— which was originally planned for France, Germany and the three Nordic countries&amp;nbsp;— seemed moribund. Then, Welsh physicist [[Granville Beynon]] became involved and by 1975, the agreement was signed, with the UK as a member. The proposal for UK membership had originally been turned down by the appropriate SRC committee. Beynon, however, persuaded the Board to reverse the decision of the committee and as a result of his efforts, hundreds of European scientists have had the opportunity to use the world's most advanced ionospheric radar.&lt;ref name=mist /&gt;

In 2008, [[Doritos]] embarked upon an "out-of-this-world" advertising campaign, literally beaming a 30-second advertisement for Doritos brand tortilla chips into a solar system 42 light years away. This project is in collaboration with EISCAT Space Centre in [[Svalbard]]. The "You Make It, We'll Play It" contest chose the winning advertisement that was transmitted on June 12, 2008. The ad was beamed towards a distant star, within the Ursa Major constellation which is orbited by planets which may harbor life.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;

== EISCAT facilities==

[[Image:EISCAT Sodankylä radar.JPG|right|thumb|EISCAT Sodankylä receiver antenna (diameter 32m) after conversion to 224 MHz (crossed dipole replaced Cassegrain subreflector at focal point)]]

EISCAT operates several facilities north of the [[Scandinavia]]n [[arctic circle]].&lt;ref name=eiscat-new&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.eiscat.se/about/whatiseiscat_new| title=What is EISCAT| publisher=EISCAT| access-date=2015-05-23| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004043210/https://www.eiscat.se/about/whatiseiscat_new| archivedate=2015-10-04| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At Ramfjordmoen, near [[Tromsø]], Norway the EISCAT facility has: a [[Ionospheric heater]] with HF radar capabilities; a tristatic [[VHF]] radar at 224&amp;nbsp;MHz with a 4 x 30m-by-40m [[parabolic cylinder antenna]]; and a monostatic [[UHF]] radar at 931&amp;nbsp;MHz with a 32 m [[parabolic dish antenna]].&lt;ref name=eiscat-facilities&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.eiscat.se/scientist/document/technical-specifications/| title=The EISCAT facilities| publisher=EISCAT| access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the start in 1981 the [[UHF]] radar was a steerable tristatic system, but due to interference from telecommunications in the 930 MHZ band, the remote receivers were converted to receive the VHF signal during 2012.
* At [[Kiruna]], EISCAT operates a 32 m parabolic dish antenna receiver which was originally part of the tristatic UHF system but was converted to receive the VHF frequency (224&amp;nbsp;MHz) during 2012.&lt;ref name=eiscat-facilities /&gt;
* At [[Sodankylä]], Finland, EISCAT also operates a 32 m VHF-band parabolic dish antenna receiver working at 224&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name=eiscat-facilities /&gt;
* At [[Longyearbyen]], on the Norwegian [[Svalbard]] archipelago, EISCAT operates the EISCAT Svalbard radar (ESR). It consists of a 32 m steerable parabolic dish antenna and a 42 m field aligned antenna, operating at 500&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name=eiscat-new /&gt;&lt;ref name=eiscat-facilities /&gt;

The Tromsø VHF transmitter, together with the Kiruna and Sodankylä VHF receivers, form a [[multistatic radar]] system.

Additionally, the [[KAIRA|Kilpisjärvi Atmospheric Imaging Receiver Array]] (KAIRA), near [[Kilpisjärvi]], Finland can also serve as a VHF receiver in conjunction with the Tromsø transmitter.&lt;ref name=kira&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sgo.fi/KAIRA/| title=SGO: KAIRA| publisher=SGO| access-date=2015-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EISCAT 3D==

EISCAT is planning on building a next generation radar capable of providing 3D monitoring of the atmosphere and ionosphere. The new system is called '''EISCAT_3D'''.

In 2008, the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures selected EISCAT_3D for its "Roadmap 2008 for Large-Scale European Research Infrastructures for the next 20–30 years."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eiscat3d.se/idea "What is Eiscat 3D?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

EISCAT_3D will be a [[multistatic radar]] composed of five [[phased-array radar|phased-array]] antenna fields. each field will have around 10,000 crossed [[dipole antenna]] elements. All five sites will act as receivers, with a single core site transmitting at 233&amp;nbsp;MHz (VHF band). The sites will be spread over Finland, Norway and Sweden. Each site will have a central array, surrounded by a set of smaller arrays, providing a high spatial resolution via  [[aperture synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.eiscat3d.se/status2015/configuration| title=EISCAT_3D System configuration| access-date=2015-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preparations for EISCAT_3D ===
During the summer of 2017, EISCAT will build a 91-element subarray at the site at Ramfjordmoen for hardware testing purposes and the full system is expected to be operational around 2021.
The [[KAIRA]] system is also a pathfinder for the development of EISCAT_3D.&lt;ref name=kira /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2651">'''Electroantennography''' or '''EAG''' is a technique for measuring the average output of an [[insect]] [[antenna (biology)|antenna]] to its [[brain]] for a given [[odor]]. It is commonly used in [[electrophysiology]] while studying the function of the [[olfactory]] pathway in insects. The technique was invented in 1957 by German biologist Dietrich Schneider&lt;ref&gt;National Academy of sciences (2003). ''Beyond discovery - Insect pheromones''.&lt;/ref&gt; and shares similarities with [[electro-olfactography]].&lt;ref name="Glatz_2015"&gt;{{Citation |editor-last=Glatz |editor-first=Richard |year=2015 |title=Molecular Basis of Olfaction. Volume 130 of Progress in Molecular Biology and Translational Science |publisher=Academic Press|page=ix |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LFOZBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;pg=PR9#v=onepage&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0128029138 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==

Electroantennography is usually performed either by removing an antenna from the animal and inserting two chlorided silver wires for contact onto the two ends and amplifying the voltage between them while applying an odor puff to see a deflection as in the figure, or by leaving the animal intact and inserting a ground wire ([[silver]]/[[silver chloride]]) or a glass electrode filled with a buffer solution to some part of the body, usually inserted into an eye, and another to the tip of the antenna. A large bore glass electrode can also be placed directly over the tip of the antenna, such as in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' (fruit fly) antenna recordings. The latter method is useful if one is doing an experiment on the animal as a whole while doing the antennogram.

[[File:Butterfly EAG.png|400px|thumb|right|Set-up for antennogram]]

The technique is widely applied in screening of insect [[pheromone]]s by examining the responses to fractions of a compound mixture separated using [[chromatography]].&lt;ref&gt;Hummel, H. E. and Miller, T. A. (1984). ''Techniques in pheromone research''. Springer-Verlag, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, the wire inserted into the antenna is a thin silver wire that is chlorided in bleach. This is an older practice. Commonly, [[tungsten]] wires that have been chemically sharpened are inserted into a single neuron in the antenna. Further detailed examination of the odor response at the olfactory sensory level can be done by [[Sensillum|sensilla]] recording.

Although the term first appeared in a 1964 paper by Michael Beldoch, it gained popularity in the 1995 book by that title, written by author and science journalist [[Daniel Goleman]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Emotional+intelligence&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1900&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=0&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2CEmotional%20intelligence%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bemotional%20intelligence%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BEmotional%20Intelligence%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BEmotional%20intelligence%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BEMOTIONAL%20INTELLIGENCE%3B%2Cc0 | Google Ngram graph&lt;/ref&gt; Since this time, EI, and Goleman's 1995 analysis, have been criticized within the [[scientific community]],&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Kevin R.

[[Empathy]] is typically associated with EI, because it relates to an individual connecting their personal experiences with those of others. However, a number of models exist that aim to measure levels of (empathy) EI. There are currently several models of EI. Goleman's original model may now be considered a ''mixed model'' that combines what has since been modeled separately as ''ability EI'' and ''trait EI''. Goleman defined EI as the array of skills and characteristics that drive leadership performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Goleman |first= Daniel |year= 1998 |title= What Makes a Leader? |publisher= Harvard Business Review |location= |page= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''trait model'' was developed by Konstantin Vasily Petrides in 2001.  It "encompasses behavioral dispositions and self perceived abilities and is measured through self report".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Petrides| first1 = Konstantin| author-link =| last2 = Furnham| first2 = Adrian| author2-link =| title = Trait Emotional Intelligence: Psychometric Investigation with Reference to Established Trait Taxonomies| newspaper = European Journal of Personality| pages = 425–448| year = 2001| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ability model'', developed by [[Peter Salovey]] and [[John D. Mayer|John Mayer]] in 2004, focuses on the individual's ability to process emotional information and use it to navigate the [[social environment]].&lt;ref name = "Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Findings, and Implications"&gt;{{Citation |last1= Salovey |first1= Peter |last2 = Mayer |first2 =John |last3 = Caruso |first3 = David |year= 2004|title= Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Findings, and Implications | newspaper = Psychological Inquiry | pages = 197–215 |publisher= |location= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that people with high EI have greater [[mental health]], [[job performance]], and [[leadership skills]] although no [[causal relationships]] have been shown and such findings are likely to be attributable to [[general intelligence]] and specific [[personality traits]] rather than emotional intelligence as a construct. For example, Goleman indicated that EI accounted for 67% of the abilities deemed necessary for superior performance in leaders, and mattered twice as much as technical expertise or IQ.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D. (1998). Working With Emotional Intelligence. New York, NY.

Criticisms have centered on whether EI is a real [[intelligence]] and whether it has [[incremental validity]] over [[IQ]] and the [[Big Five personality traits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Harms | first1 = P.

== History ==
The term "emotional intelligence" seems first to have appeared in a 1964 paper by Michael Beldoch,&lt;ref&gt;Beldoch, M. (1964), Sensitivity to expression of emotional meaning in three modes of communication, in J. R. Davitz et al., The Communication of Emotional Meaning, McGraw-Hill, pp. 31–42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LKqQM3CLAyQC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22Sensitivity+to+expression+of+emotional+meaning+in+three+modes+of+communication%22+Beldoch&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oqKrhg_zer&amp;sig=ZS86mte_m-BGbNb24vZ_bTwoUjA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAGoVChMIk4vYqYzMyAIVglwsCh344g3I#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sensitivity%20to%20expression%20of%20emotional%20meaning%20in%20three%20modes%20of%20communication%22%20Beldoch&amp;f=false "Contributions to social interactions: Social Encounters"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905144115/https://books.google.com/books?id=LKqQM3CLAyQC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22Sensitivity+to+expression+of+emotional+meaning+in+three+modes+of+communication%22+Beldoch&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oqKrhg_zer&amp;sig=ZS86mte_m-BGbNb24vZ_bTwoUjA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAGoVChMIk4vYqYzMyAIVglwsCh344g3I |date=2017-09-05 }} Editor: Michael Argyle, reprint online on Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1966 paper by B. Leuner entitled ''Emotional intelligence and emancipation'' which appeared in the psychotherapeutic journal: ''Practice of child psychology and child psychiatry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leuner | first1 = B | year = 1966 | title = Emotional intelligence and emancipation | url = | journal = Praxis der Kinderpsychologie und Kinderpsychiatrie | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 193–203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, [[Howard Gardner]]'s ''Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences''&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1983). Frames of mind. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the idea that traditional types of intelligence, such as [[IQ]], fail to fully explain cognitive ability. He introduced the idea of [[multiple intelligences]] which included both ''interpersonal intelligence'' (the capacity to understand the intentions, motivations and desires of other people) and ''intrapersonal intelligence'' (the capacity to understand oneself, to appreciate one's feelings, fears and motivations).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M.K. (2002) "Howard Gardner and multiple intelligences", ''The Encyclopedia of Informal Education'', downloaded from {{cite web |url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/gardner.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051102035039/http://www.infed.org/thinkers/gardner.htm |archivedate=2005-11-02 |df= }} on October 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term subsequently appeared in Wayne Payne's [[doctoral thesis]], ''A Study of Emotion: Developing Emotional Intelligence'' in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, W.L. (1983/1986). A study of emotion: developing emotional intelligence; self integration; relating to fear, pain and desire" ''Dissertation Abstracts International'' 47, p. 203A (University microfilms No. AAC 8605928)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published use of the term 'EQ' (Emotional Quotient) is an article by Keith Beasley in 1987 in the British Mensa magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Beasley, K. (1987). The Emotional Quotient. ''Mensa'', May 1987, p25. It should be noted that earlier use of the term E.Q has been found in a [http://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&amp;d=stanford19791205-01.2.86.1# 1979 Stamford Daily Ad Campaign] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625165121/http://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&amp;d=stanford19791205-01.2.86.1 |date=2016-06-25 }} but was used to denote something quite different, The Economic Quotient&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=July 2016}}{{verification needed|date=July 2016}}{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 1989 [[Stanley Greenspan]] put forward a model to describe EI, followed by another by [[Peter Salovey]] and John Mayer published in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Salovey | first1 = P. | last2 = Mayer | first2 = J.D. | year = 1989 | title = Emotional intelligence | url = http://ei.yale.edu/journal/imagination-cognition-and-personality/ | journal = Imagination, Cognition, and Personality | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 185–211 | doi=10.2190/dugg-p24e-52wk-6cdg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the term became widely known with the publication of [[Daniel Goleman|Goleman]]'s book: ''Emotional Intelligence – Why it can matter more than IQ''&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D., (1995) Emotional Intelligence, New York, NY, England: Bantam Books, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; (1995). It is to this book's best-selling status that the term can attribute its popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-goleman/ |title=Dan Goleman |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=2014-03-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304084501/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-goleman/ |archivedate=2014-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dan Schawbel |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2011/09/15/daniel-goleman-on-leadership-and-the-power-of-emotional-intelligence |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104185806/http://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2011/09/15/daniel-goleman-on-leadership-and-the-power-of-emotional-intelligence |archivedate=2012-11-04 |title=Daniel Goleman on Leadership and The Power of Emotional Intelligence – Forbes |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goleman has followed up with several further popular publications of a similar theme that reinforce use of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D. (1998), Working with Emotional Intelligence&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D. (2006), Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lantieri, L. and Goleman, D.

(2011), The Brain and Emotional Intelligence: New Insights&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D. (2011), Leadership: The Power of Emotional Intelligence&lt;/ref&gt;
To date, tests measuring EI have not replaced IQ tests as a standard metric of intelligence. Emotional Intelligence has also received criticism on its role in leadership and business success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-57376240/why-emotional-intelligence-is-just-a-fad/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128120307/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-57376240/why-emotional-intelligence-is-just-a-fad/ |archivedate=2012-11-28 |title=Why emotional intelligence is just a fad – CBS News |date=2012-02-13 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between trait emotional intelligence and ability emotional intelligence was introduced in 2000.&lt;ref name="pet2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petrides | first1 = K.V. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2000a | title = On the dimensional structure of emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 29 | issue = 2| pages = 313–320 | doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(99)00195-6| citeseerx = 10.1.1.475.5285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
Emotional intelligence has been defined as "the ability to monitor one's own and other people's emotions, to discriminate between different emotions and label them appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior" by Peter Salovey and John Mayer. This definition was later broken down and refined into four proposed abilities: perceiving, using, understanding, and managing emotions. These abilities are distinct yet related.&lt;ref name="A Dictionary of Psychology" /&gt; Emotional intelligence also reflects abilities to join intelligence, empathy and emotions to enhance thought and understanding of interpersonal dynamics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5907081|title = Human Abilities: Emotional Intelligence|last = Mayer|first = John D|date = 2008|journal = Annual Review of Psychology|doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093646|pmid = 17937602|access-date = |volume = 59|pages = 507–536|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222125327/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5907081_Human_Abilities_Emotional_Intelligence|archivedate = 2015-12-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, substantial disagreement exists regarding the definition of EI, with respect to both terminology and operationalizations. Currently, there are three main models of EI:
# Ability model
# Mixed model (usually subsumed under trait EI)&lt;ref name="Kluemper, D.H. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kluemper | first1 = D.H. | year = 2008 | title = Trait emotional intelligence: The impact of core-self evaluations and social desirability | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 44 | issue = 6| pages = 1402–1412 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.12.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2010.05.029 | last1 = Martins | first1 = A. | last2 = Ramalho | first2 = N. | last3 = Morin | first3 = E. | year = 2010 | title = A comprehensive meta-analysis of the relationship between emotional intelligence and health | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 49 | issue = 6| pages = 554–564 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Trait model

Different models of EI have led to the development of various instruments for the [[psychometrics|assessment]] of the construct. While some of these measures may overlap, most researchers agree that they tap different constructs.

Specific ability models address the ways in which emotions facilitate thought and understanding. For example, emotions may interact with thinking and allow people to be better decision makers (Lyubomirsky et al. 2005).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A  person who is more responsive emotionally to crucial issues will attend to the more crucial aspects of his or her life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Aspects of  emotional  facilitation factor is to also know how  to include or exclude emotions from thought depending on context and situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is also related to [[emotional reasoning]] and understanding in response to the people, environment and circumstances one encounters in his or her day-to-day life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Ability model ==

Salovey and Mayer's conception of EI strives to define EI within the confines of the standard criteria for a new intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Salovey | first2 = P. | last3 = Caruso | first3 = D.L. | last4 = Sitarenios | first4 = G. | year = 2001 | title = Emotional intelligence as a standard intelligence | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 232–242 | doi=10.1037/1528-3542.1.3.232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MacCann | first1 = C. | last2 = Joseph | first2 = D.L. | last3 = Newman | first3 = D.A. | last4 = Roberts | first4 = R.D. | year = 2014 | title = Emotional intelligence is a second-stratum factor of intelligence: Evidence from hierarchical and bifactor models | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 358–374 | doi=10.1037/a0034755| pmid = 24341786 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following their continuing research, their initial definition of EI was revised to "The ability to perceive emotion, integrate emotion to facilitate thought, understand emotions and to regulate emotions to promote personal growth." However, after pursuing further research, their definition of EI evolved into "the capacity to reason about emotions, and of emotions, to enhance thinking. It includes the abilities to accurately perceive emotions, to access and generate emotions so as to assist thought, to understand emotions and emotional knowledge, and to reflectively regulate emotions so as to promote emotional and intellectual growth." &lt;ref name="Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Findings, and Implications" /&gt;

The ability-based model views emotions as useful sources of information that help one to make sense of and navigate the social environment.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, J.D., &amp; Salovey, P. (1997). What is emotional intelligence? In P. Salovey &amp; D. Sluyter (Eds.), Emotional development and emotional intelligence: Implications for educators (pp. 3–31). New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grewal"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Salovey | first1 = P | last2 = Grewal | first2 = D | year = 2005 | title = The Science of Emotional Intelligence | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 14 | issue = 6| page = 6 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00381.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model proposes that individuals vary in their ability to process information of an emotional nature and in their ability to relate emotional processing to a wider cognition. This ability is seen to manifest itself in certain adaptive behaviors. The model claims that EI includes four types of abilities:
# Perceiving emotions – the ability to detect and decipher emotions in faces, pictures, voices, and cultural artifacts—including the ability to identify one's own emotions. Perceiving emotions represents a basic aspect of emotional intelligence, as it makes all other processing of emotional information possible.
# Using emotions – the ability to harness emotions to facilitate various cognitive activities, such as thinking and problem solving. The emotionally intelligent person can capitalize fully upon his or her changing [[mood (psychology)|moods]] in order to best fit the task at hand.
# Understanding emotions – the ability to comprehend emotion language and to appreciate complicated relationships among emotions. For example, understanding emotions encompasses the ability to be sensitive to slight variations between emotions, and the ability to recognize and describe how emotions evolve over time.
# Managing emotions – the ability to regulate emotions in both ourselves and in others. Therefore, the emotionally intelligent person can harness emotions, even negative ones, and manage them to achieve intended goals.

The ability EI model has been criticized in the research for lacking face and predictive validity in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.psicothema.com/pdf/3277.pdf|author1=Bradberry, T.|author2=Su, L.|date=2003|title=Ability-versus skill-based assessment of emotional intelligence|journal=Psicothema|volume=18|pages=59–66|format=PDF|accessdate=2014-03-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905061723/http://www.psicothema.com/pdf/3277.pdf|archivedate=2012-09-05|df=|pmid=17295959}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in terms of construct validity, ability EI tests have great advantage over self-report scales of EI because they compare individual maximal performance to standard performance scales and do not rely on individuals' endorsement of descriptive statements about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity of competing measures of emotional intelligence|last = Brackett M.A. &amp; J.D.

=== Measurement ===

The current measure of Mayer and Salovey's model of EI, the [[Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test]] (MSCEIT) is based on a series of emotion-based problem-solving items.&lt;ref name="grewal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Salovey | first2 = P. | last3 = Caruso | first3 = D.R. | last4 = Sitarenios | first4 = G. | year = 2003 | title = Measuring emotional intelligence with the MSCEIT V2.0 | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 97–105 | doi=10.1037/1528-3542.3.1.97| pmid = 12899321 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the model's claim of EI as a type of intelligence, the test is modeled on ability-based [[IQ tests]]. By testing a person's abilities on each of the four branches of emotional intelligence, it generates scores for each of the branches as well as a total score.

Central to the four-branch model is the idea that EI requires attunement to [[social norms]]. Therefore, the [[Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test|MSCEIT]] is [[consensus based assessment|scored in a consensus fashion]], with higher scores indicating higher overlap between an individual's answers and those provided by a worldwide sample of respondents. The MSCEIT can also be expert-scored, so that the amount of overlap is calculated between an individual's answers and those provided by a group of 21 [[emotion|emotion researchers]].&lt;ref name="grewal"/&gt;

Although promoted as an ability test, the [[Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test|MSCEIT]] is unlike standard IQ tests in that its items do not have objectively correct responses. Among other challenges, the consensus scoring criterion means that it is impossible to create items (questions) that only a minority of respondents can solve, because, by definition, responses are deemed emotionally "intelligent" only if the majority of the sample has endorsed them. This and other similar problems have led some cognitive ability experts to question the definition of EI as a genuine intelligence.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In a study by Føllesdal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psykologi.uio.no/studier/drpsych/disputaser/follesdal_summary.html |title=Emotional Intelligence as Ability: Assessing the Construct Validity of Scores from the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) |author=Hallvard Føllesdal |others=PhD Thesis and accompanying papers – University of Oslo 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216094950/http://www.psykologi.uio.no/studier/drpsych/disputaser/follesdal_summary.html |archivedate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test|MSCEIT]] test results of 111 business leaders were compared with how their employees described their leader. It was found that there were no correlations between a leader's test results and how he or she was rated by the employees, with regard to [[empathy]], ability to motivate, and leader effectiveness. Føllesdal also criticized the Canadian company Multi-Health Systems, which administers the [[Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test|MSCEIT]] test. The test contains 141 questions but it was found after publishing the test that 19 of these did not give the expected answers. This has led Multi-Health Systems to remove answers to these 19 questions before scoring but without stating this officially.

=== Other measurements ===
Various other specific measures have also been used to assess ability in emotional intelligence. These measures include:
# Diagnostic Analysis of Non-verbal Accuracy&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; – The Adult Facial version includes  24 photographs of equal amount of happy, sad, angry, and fearful facial expressions of both high and low intensities which are balanced by gender. The tasks of the participants is to answer which of the four emotions is present in the given stimuli.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Japanese and Caucasian Brief Affect Recognition test&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; – Participants try to identify 56 faces of Caucasian and Japanese individuals expressing seven emotions such happiness, contempt, disgust, sadness, anger, surprise, and fear, which may also trail  off for 0.2 seconds to a different emotion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; – Participants reads 26 social scenes and answers their anticipated feelings and continuum of low to high emotional awareness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Mixed model ==

The model introduced by Daniel Goleman&lt;ref name="goleman98"&gt;Goleman, D. (1998). Working with emotional intelligence. New York: Bantam Books&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on EI as a wide array of competencies and skills that drive leadership performance. Goleman's model outlines five main EI constructs (for more details see "What Makes A Leader" by Daniel Goleman, best of Harvard Business Review 1998):

# [[Self-awareness]] – the ability to know one's emotions, strengths, weaknesses, drives, values and goals and recognize their impact on others while using [[gut feeling]]s to guide decisions.
# [[Emotional self-regulation|Self-regulation]] – involves controlling or redirecting one's disruptive emotions and impulses and adapting to changing circumstances.
# [[Social skill]] – managing relationships to move people in the desired direction
# [[Empathy]] – considering other people's feelings especially when making decisions
# [[Motivation]] – being driven to achieve for the sake of achievement

Goleman includes a set of [[emotional competence|emotional competencies]] within each construct of EI. Emotional competencies are not innate talents, but rather learned capabilities that must be worked on and can be developed to achieve outstanding performance. Goleman posits that individuals are born with a general emotional intelligence that determines their potential for learning emotional competencies.&lt;ref name="boy"&gt;Boyatzis, R., Goleman, D., &amp; Rhee, K. (2000). Clustering competence in emotional intelligence: insights from the emotional competence inventory (ECI). In R. Bar-On &amp; J.D.A. Parker (eds.): Handbook of emotional intelligence (pp. 343–362). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; Goleman's model of EI has been criticized in the research literature as mere "[[pop psychology]]" (Mayer, Roberts, &amp; Barsade, 2008).

=== Measurement ===

Two measurement tools are based on the Goleman model:
# The Emotional Competency Inventory (ECI), which was created in 1999, and the Emotional and Social Competency Inventory (ESCI), a newer edition of the ECI was developed in 2007. The Emotional and Social Competency – University Edition (ESCI-U) is also available. These tools developed by Goleman and [[Richard Boyatzis|Boyatzis]] provide a behavioral measure of the Emotional and Social competencies.
# [[The Emotional Intelligence Appraisal]], which was created in 2001 and which can be taken as a self-report or 360-degree assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Bradberry, Travis and Greaves, Jean. (2009). ''[[Emotional Intelligence 2.0]]''. San Francisco: Publishers Group West. {{ISBN|978-0-9743206-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trait model ==
{{See also|Trait theory}}
Konstantinos Vasilis Petrides ("K. V. Petrides") proposed a conceptual distinction between the ability based model and a [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] based model of EI and has been developing the latter over many years in numerous publications.&lt;ref name="pet2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="petrides07"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petrides | first1 = K.V. | last2 = Pita | first2 = R. | last3 = Kokkinaki | first3 = F. | year = 2007 | title = The location of trait emotional intelligence in personality factor space | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = 98 | issue = 2| pages = 273–289 | doi=10.1348/000712606x120618| pmid = 17456273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trait EI is "a constellation of emotional self-perceptions located at the lower levels of personality."&lt;ref name="petrides07"/&gt; In lay terms, trait EI refers to an individual's self-perceptions of their emotional abilities. This definition of EI encompasses behavioral dispositions and self-perceived abilities and is measured by [[self-report inventory|self report]], as opposed to the ability based model which refers to actual abilities, which have proven highly resistant to scientific measurement. Trait EI should be investigated within a [[personality psychology|personality]] framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petrides | first1 = K.V. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2001 | title = Trait emotional intelligence: Psychometric investigation with reference to established trait taxonomies | url = | journal = European Journal of Personality | volume = 15 | issue = 6| pages = 425–448 | doi=10.1002/per.416}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative label for the same construct is trait emotional [[self-efficacy]].

The trait EI model is general and subsumes the Goleman model discussed above. The conceptualization of EI as a personality trait leads to a construct that lies outside the [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of human cognitive ability. This is an important distinction in as much as it bears directly on the operationalization of the construct and the theories and hypotheses that are formulated about it.&lt;ref name="pet2000"/&gt;

=== Measurement ===

There are many self-report measures of EI,&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, J.C., Petrides, K.V., &amp; Furnham, A. (2005). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.474.294&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Measuring trait emotional intelligence]. In R. Schulze and R.D. Roberts (Eds.), International Handbook of Emotional Intelligence (pp.181–201). Cambridge, Massachusetts: Hogrefe &amp; Huber.&lt;/ref&gt; including the EQ-i, the Swinburne University Emotional Intelligence Test (SUEIT), and the Schutte EI model. None of these assess intelligence, abilities, or skills (as their authors often claim), but rather, they are limited measures of trait emotional intelligence.&lt;ref name="petrides07" /&gt; The most widely used and widely researched measure of self-report or self-schema (as it is currently referred to) emotional intelligence is the EQ-i 2.0. Originally known as the [[Reuven Bar-On|BarOn]] EQ-i, it was the first self-report measure of emotional intelligence available, the only measure predating Goleman's best-selling book. There are over 200 studies that have used the EQ-i or EQ-i 2.0. It has the best norms, reliability, and validity of any self-report instrument and was the first one reviewed in Buros Mental Measures Book. The EQ-i 2.0 is available in many different languages as it is used worldwide.

The TEIQue provides an operationalization for the model of Petrides and colleagues, that conceptualizes EI in terms of personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petrides | first1 = K.V. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2003 | title = Trait emotional intelligence: behavioral validation in two studies of emotion recognition and reactivity to mood induction | url = | journal = European Journal of Personality | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 39–75 | doi=10.1002/per.466}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test encompasses 15 subscales organized under four factors: [[Quality of life|well-being]], [[self-control]], [[emotionality]], and [[sociability]]. The [[psychometrics|psychometric]] properties of the TEIQue were investigated in a study on a French-speaking population, where it was reported that TEIQue scores were globally [[normally distributed]] and [[reliability (statistics)|reliable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikolajczak | first1 = Luminet | last2 = Leroy | last3 = Roy | year = 2007 | title = Psychometric Properties of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire: Factor Structure, Reliability, Construct, and Incremental Validity in a French-Speaking Population | url = | journal = Journal of Personality Assessment | volume = 88 | issue = 3| pages = 338–353 | doi=10.1080/00223890701333431| pmid = 17518555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers also found TEIQue scores were unrelated to nonverbal reasoning ([[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Raven's matrices]]), which they interpreted as support for the personality trait view of EI (as opposed to a form of intelligence). As expected, TEIQue scores were positively related to some of the [[Big Five personality traits]] ([[extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], [[openness to experience|openness]], [[conscientiousness]]) as well as inversely related to others ([[alexithymia]], [[neuroticism]]). A number of quantitative genetic studies have been carried out within the trait EI model, which have revealed significant genetic effects and heritabilities for all trait EI scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/a0013439 | last1 = Vernon | first1 = P.A. | last2 = Petrides | first2 = K.V. | last3 = Bratko | first3 = D. | last4 = Schermer | first4 = J.A. | year = 2008 | title = A behavioral genetic study of trait emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 8 | issue = 5| pages = 635–642 | pmid = 18837613 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two recent studies (one a meta-analysis) involving direct comparisons of multiple EI tests yielded very favorable results for the TEIQue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00049530903312857 | last1 = Gardner | first1 = J.

== General effects ==
A review published in the journal of ''Annual Psychology'' found that higher emotional intelligence is positively correlated with:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Better social relations for children – Among children and teens, emotional intelligence positively correlates with good social interactions, relationships and negatively correlates with deviance from social norms, anti-social behavior measured both in and out of school as reported by children themselves, their own family members as well as their teachers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Better social relations for adults – High emotional intelligence among adults is correlated with better self-perception of social ability and more successful interpersonal relationships while less interpersonal aggression and problems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Highly emotionally intelligent individuals are perceived more positively by others – Other individuals perceive those with high EI to be more pleasant, socially skilled and empathic to be around.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Better family and intimate relationships – High EI is correlated with better relationships with the family and intimate partners on many aspects.
# Better academic achievement – Emotional intelligence is correlated with greater achievement in academics as reported by teachers but generally not  higher grades once the factor of IQ is taken into account.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Better social relations during work performance and in negotiations – Higher emotional intelligence is correlated with better social dynamics at work as well as better negotiating ability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Better psychological well-being - Emotional intelligence is positively correlated with higher [[life satisfaction]], self-esteem and lower levels of insecurity or depression. It is also negatively correlated with poor health choices and behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Allows for self-compassion - Emotionally intelligent individuals are more likely to have a better understanding of themselves, and to make conscious decisions based on emotion and rationale combined. Overall, it leads a person to [[Self-actualization|self-actualization]].&lt;ref name="Self-compassion"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heffernan|first1=Mary|last2=Quinn|first2=Mary|last3=McNulty|first3=Rita|last4=Fitzpatrick|first4=Joyce|date=2010|title=Self-compassion and emotional intelligence in nurses|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c8f7/332816fda3b9f702204718ff69e773f1ed05.pdf|journal=International Journal of Nursing Practice|volume=16|pages=366–373|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms of theoretical foundation ==

=== Cannot be recognized as form of intelligence ===
Goleman's early work has been criticized for assuming from the beginning that EI is a type of intelligence or [[cognitive ability]]. Eysenck (2000)&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|author-link = Hans Eysenck|last = Eysenck|first = H.J.|title = Intelligence: A New Look|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0-7658-0707-6|postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes that Goleman's description of EI contains unsubstantiated assumptions about intelligence in general, and that it even runs contrary to what researchers have come to expect when studying types of intelligence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[Goleman] exemplifies more clearly than most the fundamental absurdity of the tendency to class almost any type of behavior as an 'intelligence'... If these five 'abilities' define 'emotional intelligence', we would expect some evidence that they are highly correlated; Goleman admits that they might be quite uncorrelated, and in any case if we cannot measure them, how do we know they are related? So the whole theory is built on quicksand: there is no sound scientific basis."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, Locke (2005)&lt;ref name="locke"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/job.318 | last1 = Locke | first1 = E.A. | year = 2005 | title = Why emotional intelligence is an invalid concept | url = | journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 425–431 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that the concept of EI is in itself a misinterpretation of the intelligence construct, and he offers an alternative interpretation: it is not another form or type of intelligence, but intelligence—the ability to grasp [[abstractions]]—applied to a particular life domain: emotions. He suggests the concept should be re-labeled and referred to as a skill.

The essence of this criticism is that scientific inquiry depends on valid and consistent construct utilization, and that before the introduction of the term EI, psychologists had established theoretical distinctions between factors such as abilities and achievements, skills and habits, attitudes and values, and personality traits and emotional states.&lt;ref name="everydaypsychology"&gt;Mattiuzzi, P.G. (2008) [http://everydaypsychology.com/2008/12/emotional-intelligence-im-not-feeling.html Emotional Intelligence? I'm not feeling it.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720053237/http://everydaypsychology.com/2008/12/emotional-intelligence-im-not-feeling.html |date=2009-07-20 }} everydaypsychology.com&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, some scholars believe that the term ''EI'' merges and conflates such accepted concepts and definitions.

=== Confusing skills with moral qualities ===

[[Adam Grant]] warned of the common but mistaken perception of EI as a desirable moral quality rather than a skill, Grant asserting that a well-developed EI is not only an instrumental tool for accomplishing goals, but has a dark side as a weapon for manipulating others by robbing them of their capacity to reason.&lt;ref name=TheAtlantic20140102&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/01/the-dark-side-of-emotional-intelligence/282720/ |title=The Dark Side of Emotional Intelligence |last=Grant |first=Adam |date=January 2, 2014 |website=The Atlantic |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MsAko357?url=http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/01/the-dark-side-of-emotional-intelligence/282720/ |archivedate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Has little predictive value ===

Landy (2005)&lt;ref name="landy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Landy | first1 = F.J. | year = 2005 | title = Some historical and scientific issues related to research on emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 411–424 | doi=10.1002/job.317}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the few [[wikt:incremental|incremental]] validity studies conducted on EI have shown that it adds little or nothing to the explanation or prediction of some common outcomes (most notably academic and work success). Landy suggested that the reason why some studies have found a small increase in [[predictive validity]] is a [[methodology|methodological]] fallacy, namely, that alternative explanations have not been completely considered:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"EI is compared and contrasted with a measure of abstract intelligence but not with a personality measure, or with a personality measure but not with a measure of academic intelligence." Landy (2005)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, other researchers have raised concerns about the extent to which self-report EI measures [[correlation|correlate]] with established personality dimensions. Generally, self-report EI measures and personality measures have been said to converge because they both purport to measure personality traits.&lt;ref name="petrides07"/&gt; Specifically, there appear to be two dimensions of the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] that stand out as most related to self-report EI&amp;nbsp;– [[neuroticism]] and [[extroversion]]. In particular, neuroticism has been said to relate to negative emotionality and [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]]. Intuitively, individuals scoring high on neuroticism are likely to score low on self-report EI measures.

The interpretations of the correlations between EI questionnaires and personality have been varied. The prominent view in the scientific literature is the Trait EI view, which re-interprets EI as a collection of personality traits.&lt;ref name="Mikolajczak07"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikolajczak | first1 = M. | last2 = Luminet | first2 = O. | last3 = Leroy | first3 = C. | last4 = Roy | first4 = E. | year = 2007 | title = Psychometric properties of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire | url = | journal = Journal of Personality Assessment | volume = 88 | issue = 3| pages = 338–353 | doi=10.1080/00223890701333431| pmid = 17518555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith08"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = L. | last2 = Ciarrochi | first2 = J. | last3 = Heaven | first3 = P.

== Criticisms of measurement ==

=== Ability model ===
[[File:Tom Reed speaks at NAVAIR’s “Mentoring at the Speed of Life” event.jpg|thumb|right|A speaker describes four stages of emotional intelligence: [[self-awareness]], [[social consciousness]], [[self-care]] and relationship management, as part of [[NAVAIR]]’s “Mentoring at the Speed of Life” event]]

====Measures conformity, not ability ====
One criticism of the works of Mayer and Salovey comes from a study by Roberts et al. (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = R.D. | last2 = Zeidner | first2 = M. | last3 = Matthews | first3 = G. | year = 2001 | title = Does emotional intelligence meet traditional standards for an intelligence? Some new data and conclusions | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 196–231 | doi=10.1037/1528-3542.1.3.196| pmid = 12934681 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that the EI, as measured by the MSCEIT, may only be measuring conformity. This argument is rooted in the MSCEIT's use of consensus-based assessment, and in the fact that scores on the MSCEIT are negatively distributed (meaning that its scores differentiate between people with low EI better than people with high EI).

==== Measures knowledge, not ability ====
Further criticism has been leveled by Brody (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brody |first1=N |year=2004 |title=What cognitive intelligence is and what emotional intelligence is not |url=http://psychometriclab.com/Brody.pdf |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=234–238 |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1503_03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207093225/http://psychometriclab.com/Brody.pdf |archivedate=2016-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who claimed that unlike tests of cognitive ability, the MSCEIT "tests knowledge of emotions but not necessarily the ability to perform tasks that are related to the knowledge that is assessed". The main argument is that even though someone knows how he or she should behave in an emotionally laden situation, it doesn't necessarily follow that the person could actually carry out the reported behavior.

==== Measures personality and general intelligence ====
New research is surfacing that suggests that ability EI measures might be measuring personality in addition to general intelligence. These studies examined the multivariate effects of personality and intelligence on EI and also corrected estimates for measurement error (which is often not done in some validation studies)[cite source]. For example, a study by Schulte, Ree, Carretta (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schulte | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Ree | first2 = M. J. | last3 = Carretta | first3 = T. R. | year = 2004 | title = Emotional intelligence: Not much more than g and personality | url = | = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 37 | issue = 5| pages = 1059–1068 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2003.11.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that general intelligence (measured with the Wonderlic Personnel Test), agreeableness (measured by the NEO-PI), as well as gender could reliably be used to predict the measure of EI ability.

They gave a multiple correlation (R) of .81 with the MSCEIT (perfect prediction would be 1). This result has been replicated by Fiori and Antonakis (2011),;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fiori | first1 = M. | last2 = Antonakis | first2 = J. | year = 2011 | title = The ability model of emotional intelligence: Searching for valid measures | url = https://serval.unil.ch/notice/serval:BIB_B46FDCF00E58| journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 50 | issue = 3| pages = 329–334 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2010.10.010 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; they found a multiple R of .76 using Cattell’s "Culture Fair" intelligence test and the Big Five Inventory (BFI); significant covariates were intelligence (standardized beta = .39), agreeableness (standardized beta = .54), and openness (standardized beta = .46). Antonakis and Dietz (2011a),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Antonakis | first1 = J. | last2 = Dietz | first2 = J. | year = 2011a | title = Looking for Validity or Testing It?

§

=== Self-report measures susceptible to faking ===
More formally termed socially desirable responding (SDR), faking good is defined as a response pattern in which test-takers systematically represent themselves with an excessive positive bias (Paulhus, 2002). This bias has long been known to contaminate responses on personality inventories (Holtgraves, 2004; McFarland &amp; Ryan, 2000; Peebles &amp; Moore, 1998; Nichols &amp; Greene, 1997; Zerbe &amp; Paulhus, 1987), acting as a mediator of the relationships between self-report measures (Nichols &amp; Greene, 1997; Gangster et al., 1983).{{full citation needed|date=July 2012}}

It has been suggested that responding in a desirable way is a response set, which is a situational and temporary response pattern (Pauls &amp; Crost, 2004; Paulhus, 1991). This is contrasted with a response style, which is a more long-term trait-like quality. Considering the contexts some self-report EI inventories are used in (e.g., employment settings), the problems of response sets in high-stakes scenarios become clear (Paulhus &amp; Reid, 2001).

There are a few methods to prevent socially desirable responding on behavior inventories. Some researchers believe it is necessary to warn test-takers not to fake good before taking a personality test (e.g., McFarland, 2003). Some inventories use validity scales in order to determine the likelihood or consistency of the responses across all items.

=== Predictive power unsubstantiated ===
Landy&lt;ref name="landy"/&gt; distinguishes between the "commercial wing" and "the academic wing" of the EI movement, basing this distinction on the alleged predictive power of EI as seen by the two currents. According to Landy, the former makes expansive claims on the applied value of EI, while the latter is trying to warn users against these claims. As an example, Goleman (1998) asserts that "the most effective leaders are alike in one crucial way: they all have a high degree of what has come to be known as emotional intelligence. ...emotional intelligence is the sine qua non of leadership". In contrast, Mayer (1999) cautions "the popular literature's implication—that highly emotionally intelligent people possess an unqualified advantage in life—appears overly enthusiastic at present and unsubstantiated by reasonable scientific standards." Landy further reinforces this argument by noting that the data upon which these claims are based are held in "proprietary databases", which means they are unavailable to independent researchers for reanalysis, replication, or verification.&lt;ref name="landy"/&gt; Thus, the credibility of the findings cannot be substantiated in a scientific way, unless those datasets are made public and available for independent analysis.

In an academic exchange, Antonakis and Ashkanasy/Dasborough mostly agreed that researchers testing whether EI matters for leadership have not done so using robust research designs; therefore, currently there is no strong evidence showing that EI predicts leadership outcomes when accounting for personality and IQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Antonakis | first1 = J. | last2 = Ashkanasy | first2 = N.

A recently published meta-analysis seems to support the Antonakis position: In fact, Harms and Credé found that overall (and using data free from problems of common source and common methods), EI measures correlated only [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|ρ]] = 0.11 with measures of [[transformational leadership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Harms | first1 = P.

=== NICHD pushes for consensus ===
The [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] has recognized that because there are divisions about the topic of emotional intelligence, the mental health community needs to agree on some guidelines to describe good mental health and positive mental living conditions. In their section, "Positive Psychology and the Concept of Health", they explain. "Currently there are six competing models of positive health, which are based on concepts such as being above normal, character strengths and core virtues, developmental maturity, social-emotional intelligence, subjective well-being, and [[Psychological resilience|resilience]]. But these concepts define health in philosophical rather than empirical terms. Dr. [Lawrence] Becker suggested the need for a consensus on the concept of positive psychological health...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nitkin |first1=Ralph |last2=Harris |first2=Meredith |date=August 29, 2006 |title=National Advisory Board on Medical Rehabilitation Research: Meeting for Minutes for December 2–3, 2004 |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/overview/advisory/nmrrab/minutes/2004dec.cfm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716163703/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/overview/advisory/nmrrab/minutes/2004dec.cfm |archivedate=July 16, 2009 |publisher=[[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interactions with other phenomena ==

=== Bullying ===
{{Main|Bullying and emotional intelligence}}
[[Bullying]] is [[abusive]] [[social interaction]] between peers which can include [[aggression]], [[harassment]], and [[violence]]. Bullying is typically repetitive and enacted by those who are in a position of [[Abusive power and control|power]] over the victim. A growing body of research illustrates a significant relationship between bullying and emotional intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Approach to bullying and victimization|journal = Canadian Family Physician|date = 2009-04-01|issn = 0008-350X|pmc = 2669002|pmid = 19366941|pages = 356–360|volume = 55|issue = 4|first = Jennifer|last = Lamb|first2 = Debra J.|last2 = Pepler|first3 = Wendy|last3 = Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The relationship between bullying, victimization, trait emotional intelligence, self-efficacy and empathy among preadolescents|journal = Social Psychology of Education|date = 2011-07-26|issn = 1381-2890|pages = 41–58|volume = 15|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s11218-011-9168-9|first = Constantinos M.|last = Kokkinos|first2 = Eirini|last2 = Kipritsi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Brief report: Emotional intelligence, victimisation and bullying in adolescents|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014019711100025X|journal = Journal of Adolescence|date = 2012-02-01|pages = 207–211|volume = 35|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.adolescence.2011.03.002|pmid = 21470670|first = Justine|last = Lomas|first2 = Con|last2 = Stough|first3 = Karen|last3 = Hansen|first4 = Luke A.|last4 = Downey}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have shown that emotional intelligence is a key factor in the analysis of cases of cybervictimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rey|first=Lourdes|last2=Quintana-Orts|first2=Cirenia|last3=Mérida-López|first3=Sergio|last4=Extremera|first4=Natalio|date=2018-07-01|title=Emotional intelligence and peer cybervictimisation in adolescents: Gender as moderator|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=26|issue=56|pages=09–18|doi=10.3916/c56-2018-01|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

by demonstrating a relevant impact on health and social adaptation.   Emotional intelligence (EI) is a set of abilities related to the understanding, use and management of emotion as it relates to one's self and others. Mayer et al., (2008) defines the dimensions of overall EI as: "accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Roberts | first2 = R.D | last3 = Barasade | first3 = S.G. | year = 2008 | title = Human abilities: Emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 507–536 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093646 | pmid = 17937602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept combines emotional and intellectual processes.&lt;ref name="Tolegenova"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tolegenova | first1 = A.A. | last2 = Jakupov | first2 = S.M. | last3 = Cheung Chung | first3 = Man | last4 = Saduova | first4 = S. | last5 = Jakupov | first5 = M.S | year = 2012 | title = A theoretical formation of emotional intelligence and childhood trauma among adolescents | journal = Procedia – Social and Behavioral Sciences | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 1891–1894 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.12.142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower emotional intelligence appears to be related to involvement in bullying, as the bully and/or the victim of bullying. EI seems to play an important role in both bullying behavior and [[victimization]] in bullying; given that EI is illustrated to be malleable, EI education could greatly improve bullying prevention and intervention initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mckenna | first1 = J. | last2 = Webb | first2 = J. | year = 2013 | title = Emotional intelligence | url = | journal = British Journal of Occupational Therapy | volume = 76 | issue = 12| page = 560 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Job performance ===
{{Main|Job performance and emotional intelligence}}
Research of EI and [[job performance]] shows mixed results: a positive relation has been found in some of the studies, while in others there was no relation or an inconsistent one.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; This led researchers Cote and Miners (2006)&lt;ref name="Côté 2006" /&gt; to offer a compensatory model between EI and IQ, that posits that the association between EI and job performance becomes more positive as cognitive intelligence decreases, an idea first proposed in the context of academic performance (Petrides, Frederickson, &amp; Furnham, 2004). The results of the former study supported the compensatory model: employees with low IQ get higher task performance and organizational citizenship behavior directed at the organization, the higher their EI. It has also been observed that there is no significant link between emotional intelligence and work attitude behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Relojo|first1=D.|last2=Pilao|first2=S.J.|last3=Dela Rosa|first3=R.|title=From passion to emotion: Emotional quotient as predictor of work attitude behavior among faculty member|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=2015|volume=8|issue=4|pages=1–10|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1098164.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent study suggests that EI is not necessarily a universally positive trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farh|first=C. C.|author2=Seo, Tesluk|title=Emotional Intelligence, Teamwork Effectiveness, and Job Performance: The Moderating Role of Job Context|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=March 5, 2012|volume=97|issue=4|doi=10.1037/a0027377|pages=890–900|pmid=22390388}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found a negative correlation between EI and managerial work demands; while under low levels of managerial work demands, they found a negative relationship between EI and teamwork effectiveness. An explanation for this may suggest gender differences in EI, as women tend to score higher levels than men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; This furthers the idea that job context plays a role in the relationships between EI, teamwork effectiveness, and job performance. Another find was discussed in a study that assessed a possible link between EI and entrepreneurial behaviors and success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahmetoglu|first=Gorkan|author2=Leutner, Franziska|author3=Chamorro-Premuzic, Tomas|title=EQ-nomics: Understanding the relationship between individual differences in trait emotional intelligence and entrepreneurship|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=December 2011|volume=51|issue=8|pages=1028–1033|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.08.016&lt;!--pmid=893295016--&gt;|url=http://www.drtomascp.com/uploads/EQNomics_PAID_2011.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101125012/http://www.drtomascp.com/uploads/EQNomics_PAID_2011.pdf|archivedate=2013-11-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although studies between emotional intelligence (EI) and job performance has shown mixed results of high and low correlations, EI is undeniably better predictor than most of the hiring methods commonly used in companies, such as [[Recommendation letter|letter of references]], [[cover letter]], among others. By 2008, 147 companies and consulting firms in U.S had developed programmes that involved EI for training and hiring employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joseph|first=Dana L.|last2=Jin|first2=Jing|last3=Newman|first3=Daniel A.|last4=O’Boyle|first4=Ernest H.|title=Why does self-reported emotional intelligence predict job performance?

These findings may contribute organisations in different ways. For instance, employees high on EI would be more aware of their own emotions and from others, which in turn, could lead companies to better profits and less unnecessary expenses. This is especially important for expatriate managers, who have to deal with mixed emotions and feelings, while adapting to a new working culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Moreover, employees high in EI show more confidence in their roles, which allow them to face demanding tasks positively.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sy|first=Thomas|last2=Tram|first2=Susanna|last3=O’Hara|first3=Linda A.|date=2006-06-01|title=Relation of employee and manager emotional intelligence to job satisfaction and performance|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879105001260|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|volume=68|issue=3|pages=461–473|doi=10.1016/j.jvb.2005.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a popular science book by the journalist Daniel Goleman, emotional intelligence accounts for more career success than IQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goleman|first1=Daniel|title=Emotional Intelligence|date=1994|publisher=Bantam Books|isbn=9780747526254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, other studies argued that employees high on EI perform substantially better than employees low in EI.

In the job performance – emotional intelligence correlation is important to consider the effects of [[Managing up and managing down|managing up]], which refers to the good and positive relationship between the employee and his/her supervisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2015/01/what-everyone-should-know-about-managing-up|title=What Everyone Should Know About Managing Up|website=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2016-04-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426042345/https://hbr.org/2015/01/what-everyone-should-know-about-managing-up|archivedate=2016-04-26|df=|date=2015-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous research found that quality of this relationship could interfere in the results of the subjective rating of job performance evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janssen|first=Onne|last2=Yperen|first2=Nico W.

Hence, the likelihood of  obtaining better results on performance evaluation is greater for employees high in EI than for employees with low EI.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Based on theoretical and methodological approaches, EI measures are categorized in three main streams: (1) stream 1: ability-based measures (e.g. MSCEIT), (2) stream 2: self-reports of abilities measures (e.g. SREIT, SUEIT and WLEIS) and (3) stream 3: mixed-models (e.g. AES, ECI, EI questionnaire, EIS, EQ-I and GENOS), which include measures of EI and traditional social skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ashkanasy|first=Neal M.|last2=Daus|first2=Catherine S.|date=2005-06-01|title=Rumors of the death of emotional intelligence in organizational behavior are vastly exaggerated|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=26|issue=4|pages=441–452|doi=10.1002/job.320|issn=1099-1379|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; O’Boyle Jr. and his colleagues (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Boyle|first=Ernest H.|last2=Humphrey|first2=Ronald H.|last3=Pollack|first3=Jeffrey M.|last4=Hawver|first4=Thomas H.|last5=Story|first5=Paul A.|date=2011-07-01|title=The relation between emotional intelligence and job performance: A meta-analysis|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=32|issue=5|pages=788–818|doi=10.1002/job.714|issn=1099-1379|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the three EI streams together had a positive correlation of 0.28 with job performance. Similarly, each of EI streams independently obtained a positive correlation of 0.24, 0.30 and 0.28, respectively. Stream 2 and 3 showed an incremental validity for predicting job performance over and above personality ([[Big Five personality traits|Five Factor model]]) and [[G factor (psychometrics)|general cognitive ability]]. Both, stream 2 and 3 were the second most important predictor of job performance below [[G factor (psychometrics)|general cognitive ability.]] Stream 2 explained 13.6% of the total variance; whereas stream 3, explained 13.2%. In order to examine the reliability of these findings, a publication bias analysis was developed. Results indicated that studies on EI-job performance correlation prior to 2010 do not present substantial evidences to suggest the presence of [[publication bias]].

Despite the validity of previous findings, some researchers still question whether EI – job performance correlation makes a real impact on business strategies. They argue that popularity of emotional intelligence’s studies is due to media advertising, rather than objective scientific findings.&lt;ref name="Côté 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Côté|first=Stéphane|last2=Miners|first2=Christopher T.

This relationship requires the presence of other constructs to rise important outcomes. For instance, previous studies found that EI is positively associated with teamwork effectiveness under job contexts of high managerial work demands, which improves job performance. This is due to activation of strong emotions during performance on this job context. In this scenario, emotional intelligent individuals show a better set of resources to succeed on their roles. However, individuals with high EI show a similar level of performance than non-emotional intelligent employees under different job contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farh|first=Crystal I. C.

[[Emotional exhaustion]] showed a negative association with two components of EI (optimism and social skills). This association impacted negatively to job performance, as well. Hence, job performance – EI relationship is stronger under contexts of high emotional exhaustion or burn-out; in other words, employees with high levels of optimism and social skills possess better resources to outperform when facing high [[emotional exhaustion]] contexts.

=== Health ===
A 2007 meta-analysis of 44 effect sizes by Schutte found that emotional intelligence was associated with better mental and physical health. Particularly, trait EI had the stronger association with mental and physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216626194|title=A meta-analytic investigation of the relationship between emotional intelligence and health|author=Schutte|date=1 April 2007|website=ResearchGate|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208060534/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/216626194_A_meta-analytic_investigation_of_the_relationship_between_emotional_intelligence_and_health|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was replicated again in 2010 by researcher Alexandra Martin  who found trait EI as a strong predictor for health after conducting a meta-analysis based on 105 effect sizes and 19,815 participants. This meta-analysis also indicated that this line of research reached enough sufficiency and stability in concluding EI as a positive predictor for health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222693042|title=A comprehensive meta-analysis of the relationship between Emotional Intelligence and health|author=Alexandra Martins|date=1 October 2010|website=ResearchGate|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208045106/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/222693042_A_comprehensive_meta-analysis_of_the_relationship_between_Emotional_Intelligence_and_health|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-esteem and drug dependence ===
A 2012 study cross examined emotional intelligence, [[self-esteem]] and [[marijuana]] dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nehra|first=D. K.|author2=Sharma, Mushtaq, Sharma, Sharma, Nehra|title=Emotional intelligence and self esteem in cannabis abusers|journal=[[Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology]] |date=July 2012|volume=38|issue=2|pages=385–393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of a sample of 200, 100 of whom were dependent on cannabis and the other 100 emotionally healthy, the dependent group scored exceptionally low on EI when compared to the control group. They also found that the dependent group also scored low on self-esteem when compared to the control.

Another study in 2010 examined whether or not low levels of EI had a relationship with the degree of [[Substance dependence|drug]] and [[alcoholism|alcohol]] addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Chiu|author2=Chiu, Edmond|author3=Neill, Lloyd|author4=Tobin, Juliet|author5=Reid, John|title=Is low emotional intelligence a primary causal factor in drug and alcohol addiction?|journal=Australian Academic Press (Bowen Hills, QLD, Australia)|date=16 Jan 2012|pages=91–101|url=http://0-search.proquest.com.helin.uri.edu/docview/916528622?accountid=28991}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the assessment of 103 residents in a drug rehabilitation center, they examined their EI along with other psychosocial factors in a one-month interval of treatment. They found that participants' EI scores improved as their levels of addiction lessened as part of their treatment.

== Utilization ==
It has been noted that having EI as a skill can increase one's own [https://eclass.teicrete.gr/modules/document/file.php/IP-ERLSF116/Mayer-Salovey.1993-libre.pdf well being]. In other words, individuals who are conscious of the emotions of themselves and others have the privilege of enhancing relationships. It also allows people to see the multiple perspectives of a given situation, and acknowledge others' feelings about the event.

'''Ergodic literature''' is a term [[neologism|coined]] by [[Espen J. Aarseth]] in his book ''Cybertext&amp;mdash;Perspectives on Ergodic Literature'', and is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''ergon'', meaning "work", and ''hodos'', meaning "path". Aarseth's book contains the most commonly cited definition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In ergodic literature, nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text. If ergodic literature is to make sense as a concept, there must also be nonergodic literature, where the effort to traverse the text is trivial, with no [[wikt:extranoematic|extranoematic]] responsibilities placed on the reader except (for example) eye movement and the periodic or arbitrary turning of pages.&lt;ref name=Cybertext&gt;{{cite book|title=Cybertext&amp;mdash;Perspectives on Ergodic Literature|isbn=978-0801855795|first=Espen J.|last=Aarseth|year=1997|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Cybertext]] is a subcategory of ergodic literature that Aarseth defines as "texts that involve calculation in their production of scriptons".&lt;ref name=Cybertext/&gt;{{rp|75}} The process of reading printed matter, in contrast, involves "trivial" extranoematic effort, that is, merely moving one's eyes along lines of text and turning pages.  Thus, [[hypertext fiction]] of the simple node and link variety is ergodic literature but not cybertext. A non-trivial effort is required for the reader to traverse the text, as the reader must constantly select which link to follow, but a link, when clicked, will always lead to the same node. A chat bot such as [[ELIZA]] is a cybertext because when the reader types in a sentence, the text-machine actually performs calculations on the fly that generate a textual response. The [[I Ching]] is likewise cited as an example of cybertext because it contains the rules for its own reading. The reader carries out the calculation but the rules are clearly embedded in the text itself. 

It has been argued that these distinctions are not entirely clear and scholars still debate the fine points of the definitions.&lt;ref name=Clarifying&gt;{{cite web|url=https://grandtextauto.soe.ucsc.edu/2005/08/12/clarifying-ergodic-and-cybertext/|title=Clarifying Ergodic and Cybertext|first=Noah|last=Wardrip-Fruin|work=Grand Text Auto|date=August 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the definition above, ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', and ''[[Being and Time]]'' are considered nonergodic literature as they require only "trivial...effort to traverse the text[s]". A stack of stained and mouldering newspapers, on the other hand, is ergodic literature.

One of the major innovations of the concept of ergodic literature is that it is not medium-specific. [[New media]] researchers have tended to focus on the medium of the text, stressing that it is for instance paper-based or electronic. Aarseth broke with this basic assumption that the medium was the most important distinction, and argued that the mechanics of texts need not be medium-specific. Ergodic literature is not defined by medium, but by the way in which the text functions. Thus, both paper-based and electronic texts can be ergodic: "The ergodic work of [[art]] is one that in a material sense includes the rules for its own use, a work that has certain requirements built in that automatically distinguishes between successful and unsuccessful users."&lt;ref name=Cybertext/&gt;{{rp|179}}

==Examples==

Examples given by Aarseth include a diverse group of texts: wall inscriptions of the temples in ancient [[Egypt]] that are connected two-dimensionally (on one wall) or three dimensionally (from wall to wall or room to room); the ''[[I Ching]]''; [[Apollinaire]]'s ''[[Calligrammes]]'' in which the words of the poem "are spread out in several directions to form a picture on the page, with no clear sequence in which to be read"; [[Marc Saporta]]'s ''Composition No. 1, Roman'', a novel with shuffleable pages; [[Raymond Queneau]]'s ''[[Hundred Thousand Billion Poems|One Hundred Thousand Billion Poems]]''; [[B. S. Johnson]]'s ''[[The Unfortunates]]''; [[Milorad Pavić (writer)|Milorad Pavić]]'s ''[[Dictionary of the Khazars]]'' and ''Landscape Painted with Tea''; [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Pale Fire]]''; [[Joseph Weizenbaum]]'s ''[[ELIZA]]''; William Chamberlain and Thomas Etter's ''[[Racter]]''; [[Michael Joyce (writer)|Michael Joyce]]'s ''[[Afternoon, a story|Afternoon: a story]]''; Roy Trubshaw and [[Richard Bartle]]'s ''Multi-User Dungeon'' (aka ''[[Multi-User Dungeon#MUD the game|MUD1]]''); and James Aspnes's ''[[TinyMUD]]''. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Some other contemporary examples of this type of literature are [[Nick Bantock]]'s ''[[The Griffin and Sabine Trilogy]]'', ''[[S. (Dorst novel)|S.]]'' by [[J. J. Abrams]] and [[Doug Dorst]], ''[[Night Film: A Novel|Night Film]]'' by Marisha Pessl, and ''[[House of Leaves]]'' by [[Mark Z. Danielewski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://logger.believermag.com/post/2014/03/10/the-case-of-s-or-the-metatextual-pleasure-of | title=The Case of S., or, the Metatextual Pleasure of Ergodic Works | work=The Believer Logger | date=March 10, 2014 | accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All these examples require non-trivial effort from the reader, who must participate actively in the construction of the text.&lt;ref name=Clarifying/&gt;

The concepts of cybertext and ergodic literature were of seminal importance to new media studies, in particular literary approaches to digital texts and to game studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2756">'''Extended aeration''' is a method of sewage treatment using modified [[activated sludge]] procedures.  It is preferred for relatively small waste loads, where lower operating efficiency is offset by mechanical simplicity.

==Conventional sewage treatment==
Mechanized [[sewage treatment]] typically includes settling in a primary [[clarifier]], followed by biological treatment and a secondary clarifier.  Both clarifiers produce waste [[sludge]] requiring [[sewage sludge treatment]] and disposal.  Activated sludge agitates a portion of the secondary clarifier sludge in the primary clarifier effluent.  Remaining secondary sludge and all primary sludge typically require digestion prior to disposal.

==Process modification==
Extended aeration agitates all incoming waste in the sludge from a single clarifier.  The combined sludge starts with a higher concentration of inert solids than typical secondary sludge and the longer mixing time required for digestion of primary solids in addition to dissolved organics produces aged sludge requiring greater mixing energy input per unit of waste oxidized.

==Applications==
Extended aeration is typically used in prefabricated "package plants" intended to minimize design costs for waste disposal from small communities, tourist facilities, or schools.  In comparison to traditional activated sludge, longer mixing time with aged sludge offers a stable biological ecosystem better adapted for effectively treating waste load fluctuations from variable occupancy situations. Supplemental feeding with something like sugar is sometimes used to sustain sludge microbial populations during periods of low occupancy; but population response to variable food characteristics is unpredictable, and supplemental feeding increases waste sludge volumes. Sludge may be periodically removed by septic tank pumping trucks as sludge volume approaches storage capacity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12965">Before ForDisc, many anthropologists based their studies off of museum skeletal collections such as the [[Hamann-Todd Collection|Hamann-Todd collection]] that is housed at Case Western Reserve in Cleveland, Ohio, and the [[Terry Collection|Terry collection]] housed at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, DC. These museum collections house skeletal remains that were amassed from 50 to 100 years ago. Due to the age of these collections, their use in a medico-legal context did not produce accurate determination of the biological profile. ForDisc was forensic anthropologists solution to this problem, and allowed for classification when some measurements are not available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Book review: FORDISC 2.0: PERSONAL COMPUTER FORENSIC DISCRIMINANT FUNCTIONS.|last = Ubelaker|first = Douglas H.|date = 1998|journal = International Journal of Osteoarchaeology

== Software ==
ForDisc, an interactive [[discriminant function]]s program created by Stephen Ousley and Richard Jantz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-291090697.html|title=Dennis Dirkmaat publishes new book on forensic anthropology|date=31 May 2012|work=Computer Weekly News {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is widely used by [[Forensic anthropology|forensic anthropologists]] to assist in the creation of a [[decedent]]'s biological profile when only parts of the [[human cranium|cranium]] are available. The use of discriminant function analysis in this program allows the researcher to sort individuals into specific groups that are defined by certain criteria. In this program discriminate function analysis "analyzes specific groups with known membership in discrete categories such as ancestry, language, sex, tribe or ancestry, and provides a basis for the classification of new individuals with unknown group membership."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Forensic Anthropology|last = Ousley|first = Stephen|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 311–329|last2 = Jantz|first2 = Richard|editor-last = Dirkmaat|editor-first = Dennis|chapter = Ch. 15: Fordisc 3 and Statistical Methods for Estimating Sex and Ancestry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program compares potential profiles to data contained in a [[database]] of skeletal measurements of modern humans.&lt;ref name="OJ2005"&gt;Ousley, S.D., and R.L. Jantz (2005) FORDISC 3.0: Personal Computer Forensic Discriminant Functions. 
[http://web.utk.edu/~anthrop/fordiscbody.htm University of Tennessee]&lt;/ref&gt;

Using ForDisc, a decedent’s biological profile can be created based on measurements from various areas of bones, along with information about the person's age, height, race, and illnesses. For ancestry ForDisc uses standard anthropometric measurements including maximum length, maximum breadth, bi-zygomatic breadth, orbital breadth and height, maximum alveolar breadth and width, minimum frontal breadth, basion-bregma, basion-prosthion, cranial base length, bi-auricular breadth, upper facial height and breadth, foramen magnum breadth and length, frontal chord, parietal chord, occipital chord, nasal height and breadth, bi-orbital breadth, inter orbital breadth, and mastoid length.

== Databases ==
The data behind this software largely originated from the Forensic Data Bank, which is contributed to by the [[University of Tennessee]] and other contributing institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1371408.html|title=Couple Fleshes Out Skeletons' Past|last=Kelly|first=John|date=14 September 2006|work=Washington Post {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forensic Data Bank was created in 1986, through the use of a National Institute of Justice grant, and has gathered over 3400 cases.The Forensic Data Bank is a currently ongoing effort to record information about modern populations, primarily from forensic cases.

ForDisc's creators have also integrated  [[William W. Howells|W. W. Howells]] worldwide cranial data in to the program, for the use of archaeological remains. Howell's craniometric data set consist of 2500 crania from 28 different populations around the world dating to the later Holocene, in which around 82 cranial measurements were obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Who’s Who in Skulls. Ethnic Identification of Crania from Measurements|last = Howells|first = WW.|publisher = Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology,|year = 1995|isbn = |location = Cambridge, Mass.: Peabody Museum.|pages = vol. 82, pp. 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
This software is able to estimate the sex, ancestry, and stature from a skeleton of unknown identity. This software also can be used for international hearings of war crime and investigations of human rights.&lt;ref name="OJ2005" /&gt; This method is also used by the FBI, in different types of criminal cases.&lt;ref&gt;Application of Forensic Discriminant Functions to a Spanish Cranial Sample, by Douglas H. Ubelaker, Ann H. Ross, Sally M. Graver ''Forensic Science Communications'' July 2002 — Volume 4 — Number 3 [http://www2.fbi.gov/hq/lab/fsc/backissu/july2002/ubelaker1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this program was created for forensic anthropology use, many physical anthropologists are still using the program to determine the biological profile of skeletal remains that are considered archaeological in origin, but the use of this program on archaeological remains has produced misclassifications in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Century of Skeletal Biology and Paleopathology: Contrasts, Contradictions, and Conflicts|last = Armelagos|first = George J.|date = 2003|journal = American Anthropologist Vol. 105, No. 1, Special Issue: Biological Anthropology: Historical Perspectives on Current Issues, Disciplinary Connections, and Future Directions pp. 53-64|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of William W. Howell’s craniometric data set, which is published online, has made ForDisc 2.0 more appealing to many physical anthropologists concerned with archaeological remains.

== Updates ==
This program is continually updated. New and updated versions are created and added as more knowledge is acquired. The new features of ForDisc 2.0 are improved pictorial guide to measurements, and improved file management and printer control; larger number of variables, including post cranial variables; larger numbers of groups, including Howells' worldwide cranial data. The newest version, ForDisc 3.0 is an interactive forensic software that runs under the Windows system.

==Criticism==
According to the authors of the program, there are limitations that should be taken into account when using this program. Some of these limitations include the fact that ForDisc will classify any unknown into the ‘closest’ group, this means that even if an individuals ethnic group or race is not represented in the database, the program will classify it to the ‘closest’ group. Another limitation involves classification using hybrid individuals and groups. The authors state that genetic exchange between groups can cause misclassifications due to gene overlap that can consist of two ancestral populations. Another limitation deal with the classification of individuals under the age of 18, this is due to the nature of physical anthropologists ability to assess age in subadults. However, the authors state that there are differences between subadults in different groups, but these differences tend to not correspond to differences seen in adults. Another limitation that the authors believe researchers should take into account is the fact that this program is based on measurements that are affected by "disease, disuse, treatment, or trauma." The measurement of affected bone(s) may produce values that are inaccurate, and therefore he classification will not reflect the correct population affinity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ousley, Stephen, and Jantz, Richard. "Fordisc Help File, Version 1.35." Mercyhurst Archaeological Institute.   http://math.mercyhurst.edu/~sousley/Fordisc/Help/Fordisc3_Help.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The last limitation deals with archaeological populations. This limitation is due to the fact that most of the measurements in the data set that the classifications are based on in the program are from remains that are from the 20th century, and should not be used for classification of archaeological remains. This is because documented population differences and secular changes that have occurred throughout history. However, the inclusion of W. W. Howells craniometric data set has allowed researchers to classify archaeological remains due to the fact that much of the data set comes from individuals from the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2009 study found that FORDISC 3.0 "is only likely to be useful when an unidentified specimen is more or less complete and belongs to one of the populations represented in its reference samples", and even in such "favorable circumstances it can be expected to classify no more than 1 per cent of specimens with confidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2012 research was presented at the 81st Annual Meeting of the [[American Association of Physical Anthropologists]], which concluded ForDisc ancestry determination was not always consistent, and the programs' recommended acceptance criteria did not separate correct and incorrect determinations. The authors concluded that the program does not perform to expectations and should be used with caution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Poster: Elliott and Collard 2012 Going head to head: FORDISC vs CRANID in the determination of ancestry from craniometric data|url = http://meeting.physanth.org/program/2012/session08/elliott-2012-going-head-to-head-fordisc-vs-cranid-in-the-determination-of-ancestry-from-craniometric-data.html|website = meeting.physanth.org|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9520">An '''aircraft ground carriage''' (also "'''ground power assisted takeoff and landing concept'''") is a [[landing gear]] system connected to the ground, on which [[aircraft]] can [[takeoff|take off]] and [[Landing|land]] without their aircraft-installed landing gear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.welt.de/regionales/hamburg/article5049419/Bald-sollen-Flugzeuge-ohne-Raeder-landen.html|title = In Zukunft sollen Flugzeuge ohne Räder landen|last = Maaß|first = Stephan|date = 1 November 2009|work = |accessdate = |newspaper = Die Welt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technical feasibility of the ground carriage is being investigated by two research groups. In 2013, [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] included the technology into their "Technology Roadmap";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = IATA Technology Roadmap|last = |first = |publisher = IATA|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 25|edition = 4th|url = http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/environment/Documents/technology-roadmap-2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Airbus]] pursues the concept as part of its "Future by Airbus” strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aircraft.airbus.com/innovation/future-by-airbus/smarter-skies/aircraft-take-off-in-continuous-eco-climb/|title=Future by Airbus|last=|first=|date=|website=airbus.com|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages and functionality ==
The aircraft-installed landing gear and related structures and systems account for 6 to 15 per cent of the [[operating empty weight|empty weight]] of an aircraft, but it is only required on the ground for takeoff and landing as well as for [[taxiing]] and parking. During [[Cruise (aeronautics)|cruise flight]], it is carried along as unused [[ballast]]. An aircraft without landing gear could therefore require 8 to 20 per cent less fuel in flight. Furthermore, landing gears are one of the most expensive [[aircraft systems]] and complex in operation and maintenance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mbptech.de/Bilder/Poster_GroLaS.pdf|title = Fliegen ohne Fahrwerk?|date = |accessdate = |website = mbptech.de|publisher = |last = Binnebesel|first = Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, less noise is emitted when the drag of the undercarriage is omitted during approach and the engines are switched off while taxiing on ground.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.dglr.de/publikationen/2012/281494.pdf|title = AIRPORT 2030 – Lösungen für den effizienten Lufttransport der Zukunft|last = Lütjens|first = K.H.|date = 2012|journal = Deutscher Luft- und Raumfahrtkongress|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |page = 7 et seqq.|display-authors = 1|last2 = Lau|first2 = A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ground carriage provides the means for an aircraft to takeoff and land without carrying an own aircraft-installed landing gear. Instead, the aircraft is equipped with much lighter interfaces, which connect to the ground carriage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Every [[airport]] approached by aircraft without landing gear must operate at least one ground carriage. In addition, alternate airports must be available if an airport is closed due to bad weather or a system failure. For emergency landings outside of [[runways]], unsuitable flooring or unpaved ground cannot absorb the high wheel loads. Therefore, the landing gear of heavy long-haul aircraft in emergency landing on unsuitable ground is often not extended, since it would otherwise sink into ground first and then bend or break off.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.bfu-web.de/DE/Publikationen/Flugunfallinformationen/Berichte/V34%20-%20Flugunfallinfo%20Notlandung.pdf?__blob=publicationFile|title = Notlandung - mit ausgefahrenem Fahrwerk?|last = |first = |date = November 1984|journal = Flugunfall-Information|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |publisher = |editor-last = Flugunfall-Untersuchungsstelle beim Luftfahrt-Bundesamt|issue = V 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related Concepts ==
The precursor of the aircraft ground carriage is the [[Landing gear#Detachable landing gear|jettisonable or detachable landing gear]], wherein the aircraft takes-off from a cart, which is then released and eventually lands on skids. It was used on all operational examples of the [[Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet|Messerschmitt Me 163B ''Komet'']] with its jettisonable twin-wheel "dolly" main gear — its conventional arrangement included a semi-retractable tailwheel on the ''Komet's'' rear fuselage — and the first eight prototypes of the [[Arado Ar 234|Arado Ar 234 "Blitz"]], which all used a jettisonable tricycle-gear arrangement "trolley" design. The glider [[Schleicher Ka 3|Schleicher Ka 1]], which was built in the 1950s, also had a droppable landing gear. A [[de Havilland Vampire|Sea Vampire Mk.21]] landed with retracted landing gear on an aircraft carrier with flexible rubber decks for testing purposes.

The idea of the aircraft ground carriage is finally related to the [[aircraft catapult]], especially with the [[Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System]], which is currently under development.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== GroLaS ==
"GroLaS" (Ground-based Landing gear System) is an aircraft ground carriage system which is being developed since 2008 by a [[Hamburg]]-based company in cooperation with the [[Technical University of Hamburg|Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg]] and the [[German Aerospace Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.abendblatt.de/ratgeber/wissen/article122525312/Flugzeuge-starten-und-landen-ohne-Fahrwerk.html|title = Flugzeuge starten und landen ohne Fahrwerk|last = Hillmer|first = Angelika|date = 3 December 2013|work = |accessdate = |newspaper = Hamburger Abendblatt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/presse/news/article/view-article/future-by-airbus-nutzt-bodenfahrwerkskonzept-aus-hamburg.html|title = "Future by Airbus" nutzt Bodenfahrwerkskonzept aus Hamburg|date = 1 October 2012|accessdate = |website = Hamburg Aviation|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141020164127/http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/presse/news/article/view-article/future-by-airbus-nutzt-bodenfahrwerkskonzept-aus-hamburg.html|archivedate = 20 October 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the setup of a small scale demonstrator is envisioned, the full scale system is planned to be ready for market entry in 2035. The focus of the GroLaS study starts with long-haul [[cargo aircraft]]. In a first implementation of the system, the world's major cargo airports and corresponding alternate airports have to be equipped. The costs for an airport are expected to be 500 million euros.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; GroLaS is patented in Europe, the USA and China. A model in 1:87 scale, which was built in 2013, was exhibited at the [[ILA Berlin Air Show|Berlin Air Show]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.abendblatt.de/wirtschaft/article128240704/Hamburg-auf-der-Luftfahrtmesse-ILA.html|title = Hamburg auf der Luftfahrtmesse ILA|last = |first = |date = 21 May 2014|work = |accessdate = |newspaper = Hamburger Abendblatt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GroLaS consists of a slide which speeds up and slows down by means of a [[Maglev|maglev system]] installed on both sides of the runway. Thus, the conventional runway remains and enables a dual usability of conventional aircraft and of aircraft without installed landing gear. Upon landing, the slide automatically accelerates the mounted ground carriage to the approaching speed of the aircraft before touchdown and adjusts its position longitudinally and laterally to the aircraft. Pins located on the ground carriage couple into corresponding aircraft installed interfaces. Takeoff and landing are less susceptible to side winds due to a [[Euler angles#Tait.E2.80.93Bryan angles|yaw angle]] adjustment. The braking energy is converted into electrical energy, which can be used to support the aircraft engines during takeoff. The braking distance is shortened, and there is no [[Thrust reversal|reverse thrust]] required. For taxiing, the ground carriage can be decoupled from the slide to remain underneath the aircraft.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== GABRIEL ==
"GABRIEL" ("Integrated Ground and on-board system for support of the Aircraft Safe Takeoff and Landing") is a research project to develop an aircraft ground carriage started in 2011 by a consortium of several European universities, companies and institutions.

The proposed aircraft ground carriage moves on its own electromagnetic rail system and not on a conventional runway. The pins for attaching to the ground carriage are installed on the aircraft and the aircraft needs to synchronize laterally to the position of the ground carriage, which is a different approach compared to the GroLaS-concept.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Rohacs|first = Daniel|last2 = Voskuijl|first2 = Mark|last3 = Rohacs|first3 = Jozsef|last4 = Schoustra|first4 = Rommert-Jan|date = 2013|title = Preliminary evaluation of the environmental impact related to aircraft take-off and landings supported with ground based (MAGLEV) power|url = http://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-aerospace-operations/aop040|journal = Journal of Aerospace Operations|issue = 2|page = 161|doi =|pmid =|accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallels are the longitudinal and yaw angle synchronisation and, that the electrically driven ground carriage is designed demountable from the slide for taxiing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11851">'''Heterotopia''' is a concept elaborated by philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] to describe certain cultural, institutional and discursive spaces that are somehow ‘other’:  disturbing, intense, incompatible, contradictory or transforming. Heterotopias are worlds within worlds, mirroring and yet upsetting what is outside. Foucault provides examples: ships, cemeteries, brothels, prisons, gardens of antiquity, fairs, Turkish baths and many more. Foucault outlines the notion of heterotopia on three occasions between 1966-67. A [https://foucault.info/documents/heterotopia/foucault.heteroTopia.en/ talk] given to a group of architects is the most well-known explanation of the term.  His first mention of the concept is in his ''preface'' to 'The Order of Things' and refers to texts rather than socio-cultural spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foucault |first=Michel |date=1971 |title=The Order of Things |location=New York |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-0-679-75335-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Heterotopia follows the template established by the notions of [[utopia]] and [[dystopia]]. The prefix hetero- is from Ancient Greek ἕτερος (héteros, "other, another, different") and is combined with the Greek morpheme τόπος ("place") and means "other place".  A utopia is an idea or an image that is not real but represents a perfected version of society, such as [[Utopia (book)|Thomas More's book]] or [[Le Corbusier]]'s drawings. As Walter Russell Mead has written, "Utopia is a place where everything is good; dystopia is a place where everything is bad; heterotopia is where things are different — that is, a collection whose members have few or no intelligible connections with one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mead |first=Walter Russell |date=Winter 1995–1996 |title=Trains, Planes, and Automobiles: The End of the Postmodern Moment |url= |journal=World Policy Journal |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=13–31 |jstor=40209444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heterotopia in Foucault==
Foucault uses the term "heterotopia" ({{lang-fr|hétérotopie}}) to describe spaces that have more layers of meaning or relationships to other places than immediately meet the eye. In general, a heterotopia is a physical representation or approximation of a utopia, or a parallel space (such as a prison) that contains undesirable bodies to make a real utopian space impossible.

Foucault explains the link between utopias and heterotopias using the metaphor of a mirror. A mirror is a utopia because the image reflected is a 'placeless place', an unreal virtual place that allows one to see one's own visibility. However, the mirror is also a heterotopia, in that it is a real object. The heterotopia of the mirror 
is at once absolutely real, relating with the real space surrounding it, and absolutely unreal, creating a virtual image. 

Foucault articulates several possible types of heterotopia or spaces that exhibit dual meanings: 
* A ‘crisis heterotopia’ is a separate space like a boarding school or a motel room where activities like coming of age or a honeymoon take place out of sight. Foucault describes the crisis heterotopia as "reserved for individuals who are, in relation to society and to the human environment in which they live, in a state of crisis." He also points that crisis heterotopias are constantly disappearing from society and being replaced by the following heterotopia of deviation. 
* ‘Heterotopias of deviation’ are institutions where we place individuals whose behavior is outside the norm (hospitals, asylums, prisons, rest homes, cemetery).  
* Heterotopia can be a single real place that juxtaposes several spaces.  A garden can be a heterotopia, if it is a real space meant to be a microcosm of different environments, with plants from around the world. 
* 'Heterotopias of time' such as museums enclose in one place objects from all times and styles.  They exist in time but also exist outside of time because they are built and preserved to be physically insusceptible to time’s ravages. 
* 'Heterotopias of ritual or purification' are spaces that are isolated and penetrable yet not freely accessible like a public place. Either entry to the heterotopia is compulsory like in entering a prison, or entry requires special rituals or gestures, like in a [[sauna]] or a [[Turkish bath|hammam]].
* Heterotopia has a function in relation to all of the remaining spaces. The two functions are: heterotopia of illusion creates a space of illusion that exposes every real space, and the heterotopia of compensation is to create a real space—a space that is other.

Foucault's elaborations on heterotopias were published in an article entitled ''Des espaces autres'' (Of Other Spaces). The philosopher calls for a society with many heterotopias, not only as a space with several places of/for the affirmation of difference, but also as a means of escape from authoritarianism and repression, stating metaphorically that if we take the ship as the utmost heterotopia, a society without ships is inherently a repressive one, in a clear reference to [[Stalinism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Foucault |first=Michel |date=October 1984 |title=Des Espace Autres |journal=Architecture, Mouvement, Continuité |volume=5 |pages=46–49}}; it has been translated into English twice, first as {{cite journal |last=Foucault |first=Michel |others=trans.

==Heterotopia in the work of other authors==
Human geographers often connected to the [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] school have been using the term (and the author's propositions) to help understand the contemporary emergence of (cultural, social, political, economic) difference and identity as a central issue in larger multicultural cities. The idea of ''place'' (more often related to ethnicity and gender and less often to the social class issue) as a heterotopic entity has been gaining attention in the current context of postmodern, post-structuralist theoretical discussion (and political practice) in Geography and other spatial social sciences. The concept of a heterotopia has also been discussed in relation to the space in which learning takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blair |first=Erik |date=2009 |title=A Further Education College as a Heterotopia |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13596740902717465 |journal=Research in Post-Compulsory Education |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=93–101 |doi=10.1080/13596740902717465}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an extensive debate with theorists, such as [[David Harvey]], that remain focused on the matter of class domination as the central determinant of social heteronomy.

The geographer [[Edward Soja]] has worked with this concept in dialogue with the works of [[Henri Lefebvre]] concerning urban space in the book ''Thirdspace''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Soja |first=Edward |date=1996 |title=Thirdspace: Journeys to Los Angeles and Other Real-and-Imagined Places |location=Malden, Mass. |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |isbn=1-55786-675-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Franklin-Brown uses the concept of heterotopia in an epistemological context to examine the thirteenth century [[encyclopedia|encyclopedias]] of [[Vincent of Beauvais]] and [[Ramon Llull]]  as conceptual spaces where many possible ways of knowing are brought together without attempting to reconcile them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Franklin-Brown |first=Mary |date=2012 |title=Reading the World: Encyclopedic Writing in the Scholastic Age |location=Chicago, Ill. |publisher=University Of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-26068-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Media scholar Hye Jean Chung applies the concept of heterotopia to describe the multiple superimposed layers of spaciality and temporality observed in highly digitized audiovisual media. A heterotopic perception of digital media is, according to Chung, to grasp the globally dispersed labor structure of multinational capitalism that produces the audiovisual representations of various spacio-temporalities. &lt;ref&gt;Chung, Hye Jean. ''Media Heterotopias: Digital Effects and Material Labor in Global Film Production'', Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2018, pp.17-37 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Heterotopia in literature==
The concept of heterotopia has had a significant impact on literature, especially science fiction, fantasy and other [[Speculative fiction|speculative genres]]. Many readers consider the worlds of [[China Miéville]] and other [[weird fiction]] writers to be heterotopias insofar as they are worlds of radical difference transparent or of indifference to their inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gordon |first=Joan |date=November 2003 |title=Hybridity, Heterotopia, and Mateship in China Miéville's ''Perdido Street Station'' |journal=Science Fiction Studies |publisher=SF-TH Inc., DePauw University |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=456–476 |jstor=4241204}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel R. Delany|Samuel Delany's]] 1976 novel ''[[Triton (novel)|Trouble on Triton]]'' is subtitled ''An Ambiguous Heterotopia'' and was written partly in dialogue with [[Ursula K. Le Guin|Ursula K. Le Guin's]] science fiction novel ''[[The Dispossessed]]'', which is subtitled ''An Ambiguous Utopia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Delany |first=Samuel R. |date=November 1990 |title=On ''Triton'' and Other Matters: An Interview with Samuel R.

[[File:David Playing the Harp 1670 Jan de Bray.jpg|thumb|250px|''David Playing the Harp''  by [[Jan de Bray]], 1670.]]
Knowledge of the biblical period is mostly from literary references in the [[Bible]] and post-biblical sources. Religion and music historian Herbert Lockyer, Jr. writes that "music, both vocal and instrumental, was well cultivated among the [[Hebrews]], the [[New Testament]] Christians, and the [[Christian church]] through the centuries."&lt;ref name=Lockyer&gt;Lockyer, Herbert Jr. ''All the Music of the Bible'', Hendrickson Publ. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; He adds that "a look at the [[Old Testament]] reveals how God's ancient people were devoted to the study and practice of music, which holds a unique place in the historical and prophetic books, as well as the Psalter."

The music of religious ritual was first used by [[King David]], and, according to the ''Larousse Encyclopedia of Music'', he is credited with confirming the men of the [[Tribe of Levi]] as the "custodians of the music of the divine service."&lt;ref name=Hindley&gt;Hindley, Geoffrey. ''Larousse Encyclopedia of Music'', Chartwell (1971), Ch. "Jewish Music"&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Irene Hesk notes that of the twenty-four books of the [[Old Testament]], the 150 Psalms in the [[Book of Psalms]] ascribed to King David, have served as "the bedrock of Judeo-Christian hymnology," concluding that "no other poetry has been set to music more often in [[Western civilization]]."&lt;ref name=Hesk&gt;Hesk, Irene. ''Passport to Jewish Music: Its History, Traditions, and Culture'', Greenwood Publishing (1994) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of ancient musical instruments has been practiced for centuries with some researchers studying instruments from [[Israel]]/[[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] dating to the "biblical period."&lt;ref name=Burgh/&gt;{{rp|145}} Archaeological and written data have demonstrated clearly that music was an integral part of daily life in ancient Israel/Palestine. Figurines and [[iconograph]]ic depictions show that people played [[chordophone]]s and [[frame drum]]s, and that the human voice was essential as women and men sang love songs along with laments for the deceased. Data also describes outdoor scenes of music and dancing in sometimes prophetic frenzies, often with carefully orchestrated and choreographed musicians and singers within specially built structures.&lt;ref name=Burgh/&gt;{{rp|106}}

According to ancient music historian Theodore Burgh, "If we were able to step into the . . . biblical period, we would find a culture filled with music . . . where people used music in their daily lives."&lt;ref name=Burgh&gt;Burgh, Theodore W. ''Listening to the Artifacts: Music Culture in Ancient Palestine'', T &amp; T Clark International (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; "Such music was capable of expressing a great variety of moods and feelings or the broadly marked antitheses of joy and sorrow, hope and fear, faith and doubt. In fact, every shade and quality of sentiment are found in the wealth of songs and psalms and in the diverse melodies of the people."&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|X}}

==Cultural influences==

===Egypt===
[[Egypt]] was among the oldest cultures of the [[Near East]] and had a highly developed musical culture dating back to around 3000 BC. Egyptian sources, however, include only pictorial relics, some instruments, and a few literary records concerned with performance practices. On various pieces of sculpture there are reliefs of harpists and flutists taking part in religious ceremonies and social entertainments.

A number of instruments have been identified as being used in Egypt, including the [[lyre]] (a type of [[harp]]), an [[oboe]]-like instrument, various drums from Asia, the [[lute]] and the [[sistrum]] (rattle). [[Mural]]s showing singers and instrumentalist performing have also been found. According to music historian Homer Ulrich, it is likely that Egypt influenced the "educational and ethical aspects of [[Greek music]]."&lt;ref name=Ulrich&gt;Ulrich, Homer. ''A History of Music and Musical Style'', Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, Inc. (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} Stephen Batuk equally observed that the historical link of music was consummated during the week of creation where birds in the air make sounds which could be seen as music.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Sumer and Babylonia===
{{main|Music of Mesopotamia}}

Although records are minimal, it is known that between 3000 and 2300 BC organized temple music with singers existed in [[Sumer]] and [[Babylonia]], the oldest cultural groups in [[Mesopotamia]]. Excavations have uncovered several musical instruments, including harps, lutes, double oboes, and a few others.

Because of the political interrelations between the Hebrews and the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] nations of Babylonia, [[Assyria]], and the [[Hittite empire]], there were similarities between the Hebrew music of the [[Judea]]n people and the others. Jewish music began in the early years of tribal life, and the "references to music in the Bible are numerous," writes Ulrich.&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt;{{rp|11}} After the Hebrews established a kingdom in [[Israel]], their musical activities were to increase substantially.

==Ancient Israel==
[[File:Miriam.JPG|thumb|18th-century painting, "The Song of Miriam," by Paulo Malteis, Italy. Celebration after crossing the Red Sea from Egypt]]
According to music historian Abraham Schwadron, "probably the most important musical contribution of the ancient Hebrews was the elevation of the status of [[liturgy|liturgical]] music in union with ritual ceremonies."  He notes the "high degree of musico-liturgical organization" from the descriptive accounts of King [[Solomon's Temple]], such as the 24 choral groups consisting of 288 musicians which took part in 21 weekly services.&lt;ref name=Schwadron&gt;Schwadron, Abraham A. ''Music of Many Cultures: An Introduction'', Ch. 16. Univ. of California Press (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the similar instruments used by the Hebrews which were also used in neighboring cultures, including [[Phoenicia]], [[Egypt]], [[Assyria]], and [[Greece]], Schwadron writes that "it would be accurate to state that . . . it is in the particular uses of music—sacred and secular, ethical and aesthetical—that ancient [[Jewish music]] made a unique contribution.&lt;ref name=Schwadron/&gt;

Music historian John Stainer notes that the earlier relationship between [[Abraham]] and the [[Canaanites]] "in all probability influenced future Hebrew music," and which probably caused his posterity to carry a certain amount of Assyrian music or musical instruments into Egypt. He adds that a stay of four centuries "in so civilized a culture as Egypt must have largely added to their knowledge of the art."&lt;ref name=Stainer&gt;Stainer, John. ''Music of the Bible'', Da Capo Press (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

Although the ancient music of the Psalms and the other Bible books (which were all chanted), is often thought to be lost, the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible contains [[cantillation]] marks indicating a melodic line for the words. Following the French archaeomusicologist Suzanne Haik-Vantoura, some authorities now argue that these cantillation marks date from temple times and record the music sung in the temple. Attempts have been made to decipher them in modern musical notation.&lt;ref name=Haik-Vantoura&gt;Haik-Vantoura, Suzanne ''La musique de la Bible révélée (Robert Dumas: Paris, 1976)''; Mitchell, David C. ''[https://www.amazon.com/Songs-Ascents-Worship-Jerusalems-Temples/dp/1508745358/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427658006&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mitchell+songs+of+ascents The Songs of Ascents]'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Babylonian exile===
The musical traditions of the Temple were rudely broken by the destruction of the [[First Temple]] and the exile of the Jews in [[Babylon]] during the 6th century BC. Hindley notes that most of the [[psalms]] seem to have been written in the years after the return of the Jews to [[Jerusalem]]. At this time too the practice of [[antiphonal]] singing between the [[Hazzan|cantor]] and the congregation seems to have become common.&lt;ref name=Hindley/&gt;

The music of [[ancient Israel]] represents almost fourteen centuries of change, roughly from 1300 BC to 70 AD, when [[Titus]]' [[siege of Jerusalem (70)|siege of Jerusalem]] took place. Stainer points out the lack of many artifacts during this period. He concludes that the "sad lack of national monuments relating to the Jews is not surprising, when it is remembered that Jerusalem stood about seventeen sieges, each of which was accompanied by more or less destruction, and that, too, at the hands of victors who seemed to take a malicious delight in effacing the national characteristics of those they conquered."&lt;ref name=Stainer/&gt;{{rp|9}}

===Second Temple destruction===
However, after the fall of the First Temple, Werner states that the fabric of dreams spun about its earlier music included reminiscences, visions, and fantasies, as the Rabbis took pains to eradicate both its choral and instrumental traditions. "Their time had arrived, and their ideas on liturgy and music were radically different from those of the Temple priests." Werner finds it paradoxical that modern day rabbis continue to praise the instrumental music of the Temple but prohibit any and all instrumental music in their synagogues today.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|18}}

The destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 AD led to the collapse of the Hebrew nation and the beginning of the [[Diaspora]] (dispersion or exile) of Jews to other lands, such as Spain, Italy, and the [[Rhineland]]. In these places, the synagogue would replace the destroyed Temple, with new liturgical services, prayers, and rabbinical writings oriented to mourning the loss of both the Temple and personal freedom.&lt;ref name=Schwadron/&gt;

==Christian period==
[[File:Vatican image.jpg|thumb|Fresco of angel playing a lute by [[Melozzo da Forlì]].]]
Very little is known about primitive [[Christian music]], notes Whitcomb, because like most of the ancient, it was unwritten. As a result, as songs passed from generation to generation, they grew very different from the original. However, she notes that "much of this early music derived its beauty from the [[Greeks]] and its holiness from the [[Hebrews]]."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt; According to Ulrich, Hebrew music "was of direct and immediate influence on the musical practices of the early Christian church."&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt; He cites Werner in noting that "the connections between Hebrew and Christian [[chant]] have been scientifically investigated and proved."&lt;ref name=Werner&gt;Werner, Eric. ''The Sacred Bridge'', Columbia Univ. Press (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical art of the [[Levites]], the Temple musicians who were named after their historic ancestors, was lost by the end of the 1st century. In 70 AD the [[Second Temple]] was destroyed by the troops of the [[Emperor Titus]] and in the years following the Levites along with the majority of Jews fled from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. As a result, the synagogue music of the [[Jewish diaspora|Dispersion]] lost the joyful character of that of the Temple and the large instrumental forces were dispensed with.&lt;ref name=Hindley/&gt;

The [[New Testament]] was not written until centuries later than the old and the music had attained much higher development, according to music historian Ida Whitcomb. As it related to Christ, it is called [[Christian music]]. However, there are but few allusions to it in three of the [[Gospels]]: in the [[Gospel of Luke]], there are the "Angels' Song," Mary's "Magnificat," and Zacharias's "Song." In [[Acts]], [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] and [[Silas]] sing behind prison-bars: the prison is shaken, the doors fly open, and they are free. In the [[Epistles]], there are but few references to music, but in [[Ephesians]] there is a "beautiful one," in which Paul exhorts the churches to sing "Psalms" and "spiritual songs."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;

Hindley adds that antiphonal chants between cantor or priest and the congregation originated in Hebrew worship methods. At its peak around the beginning of the [[Christian era]], the elaborate music of the Temple was performed by a large [[choir]] of highly trained men singers, with boys sometimes added, and during this period many instruments also were used by the Temple orchestra.&lt;ref name=Hindley/&gt;

Whitcomb adds that many of our noblest Church [[hymns]] have been suggested by the [[Psalms]], which she notes was "the first hymn-book of the Hebrew nation and remains today not only the hymn-book of the Hebrew Temple, but also of the Christian Church."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb&gt;Whitcomb, Ida Prentice. ''Young People's Story of Music'', Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. (1928)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical instruments==
Among the earliest [[pictograph]]ic signs found have been of a boat-shaped [[harp]] found on a [[Sumer]]ian clay tablet dating back to 3000 BC, and an earlier depiction of this harp was also found in modern southwest [[Iran]] dating around 3200 BC.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|45}}

[[File:Bar Kokhba Coin.jpg|thumb|Bar Kochba coinage showing trumpets and a lyre, c. 132 AD]]
Many relics of musical instruments have been found in Palestine dating from the [[Hellenistic age]] giving details about the state, character, and practice of liturgical music.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt; In other cases, many musical instruments of the Hebrews mentioned in the Bible are identified by analogy with similar instruments found in other nearby cultures, such as Egypt and Babylonia. An example of some instruments mentioned in the bible can be found in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 3:5:
{{quote|text=that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music...}}

According to Jewish historian [[Josephus Flavius]], all details of the [[First Temple]], including its musical instruments, were made and viewed as "symbols of the universe," especially instruments like the [[kithara]] or [[lyre]]. In his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', Josephus explains that the musical instruments, along with other matters of Jewish religion, represent a perishable "image" of the [[cosmos]], or of "a cosmic Temple."&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|1}}

===String instruments===
Lockyer notes that according to the [[Scriptures]], [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]] was the father of harpists and organists (Gen. 4:20–21). He points out that the harp was among the chief instruments and the favorite of [[David]], and its use is found more than fifty times in the Bible. It was used at both joyful and mournful ceremonies, and its use was "raised to its highest perfection under David" (1 Sam. 16:23). Lockyer adds that "It was the sweet music of the harp that often dispossessed Saul of his melancholy (1 Sam. 16:14–23; 18:10–11).&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|46}} When the Jews were captive in Babylon they hung their harps up and refused to use them while in exile, earlier being part of the instruments used in the Temple (1 Kgs. 10:12).

Another stringed instrument of the harp class, and one also used by the ancient Greeks, was the [[lyre]].  A similar instrument was the [[lute]], which had a large pear-shaped body, long neck, and fretted fingerboard with head screws for tuning. Coins displaying musical instruments, [[Bar Kochba Revolt coinage]], were issued by the Jews during the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Second Jewish Revolt]] against the Roman Empire of 132–135 AD [[File:Sack of jerusalem.JPG|thumb|[[Arch of Titus]] with silver trumpets]]

In addition to those, there was the [[psaltery]], another stringed instrument which is referred to almost thirty times in Scripture. According to [[Josephus]], it had twelve strings and was played with a [[quill]], not with the hand. Another writer suggested that it was like a guitar, but with a flat triangular form and strung from side to side.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|49}}

===Wind instruments===
Among the wind instruments used in the biblical period were the [[cornet]], [[flute]], [[Horn (instrument)|horn]], organ, [[pipe (instrument)|pipe]], and trumpet.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|50}}

There were also silver trumpets and the double [[oboe]]. Werner concludes that from the measurements taken of the trumpets on the [[Arch of Titus]] in Rome and from coins, that "the trumpets were very high pitched with thin body and shrill sound." He adds that in ''[[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]]'', a manual for military organization and strategy discovered among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], these trumpets "appear clearly capable of regulating their pitch pretty accurately, as they are supposed to blow rather complicated signals in unison."&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|2}}

Whitcomb writes that the pair of silver trumpets were fashioned according to [[Torah|Mosaic law]] and were probably among the trophies which the [[Emperor Titus]] brought to Rome when he conquered Jerusalem. She adds that on the Arch raised to the victorious Titus, "there is a sculptured relief of these trumpets, showing their ancient form. (see photo)&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;

The flute was commonly used for festal and mourning occasions, according to Whitcomb. "Even the poorest Hebrew was obliged to employ two flute-players to perform at his wife's funeral."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;

The [[shofar]] (the horn of a ram) is still used for special liturgical purposes such as the [[Jewish New Year]] services in Jewish communities. As such, it is not considered a musical instrument but an instrument of theological symbolism which has been intentionally kept to its primitive character. In ancient times it was used for warning of danger, to announce the new moon or beginning of [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], or to announce the death of a notable. "In its strictly ritual usage it carried the cries of the multitude to God," writes Werner.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|12}}

===Percussion instruments===
[[File:Miriams Tanz.jpg|thumb|Miriam and women celebrate the crossing of the Red Sea; [[Tomić Psalter]], 1360/63]]
Among the percussion instruments were [[Bell (instrument)|bells]], [[cymbals]], [[sistrum]], [[tabret]], hand drums, and [[tambourines]].  Percussion instruments are those producing tones by being struck in various ways and have been used by bands and orchestras throughout history.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|59}}

The tabret, or timbrel, was a small hand-drum used for festive occasions, and was considered a woman's instrument. In modern times it was often used by the Salvation Army. According to the Bible, when the children of Israel came out of Egypt and [[The Exodus|crossed the Red Sea]], ''"[[Miriam]] took a timbrel in her hands; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dance."''&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;

==Singing==
Whitcomb writes that "much of the most beautiful music of the Bible is contained in the Psalms," and the word "psalm" comes from the Greek word meaning "to sing, to strike lyre." The psalter or psaltery was one of the instruments which accompanied the Psalm.&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt; The word soon came to signify any form of melody. The psalms were sung antiphonally or responsively, perhaps by the priest and congregation, or by two choruses.

According to Shiloah, most of the customs and ceremonies mentioned earlier, such as weddings or other celebrations, were accompanied by music made by women and attests to the importance of women's songs. But there were many instances where women sang alone or with friends and family. "The woman fortifies her spirit by singing to herself, and perhaps to her infant, who hears and absorbs the mother's confessions, longings, complaints, and dreams."  There were also "mother-songs, soldier-songs, grass-widow-songs, orphan-songs, and woman's-trade-songs." According to some, writes Shiloah, women's songs existed because of the need to compensate for the ban against public participation of women in synagogue rituals.&lt;ref name=Shiloah/&gt;

Ancient music historian Joachim Braun notes that Philo had mentioned ritualist vigils near Alexandria, that included a meal and the singing of hymns by a double chorus as accompaniment to the processions and libations.&lt;ref name=Braun&gt;Braun, Joachim. ''Music in Ancient Israel/Palestine'', W. B. Eerdmans Publ. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dance==
According to biblical historian Amnon Shiloah, dance was directly associated with music and was an important aspect of various events, although the actual dance movements are nowhere described in detail. There is meager evidence about dance when compared with a wider variety found in Egypt. However, there are many biblical descriptions of occasions that inspired dancing in biblical times.&lt;ref name=Shiloah/&gt;{{rp|209}}

In the Bible, Mishnah, and Talmud, dance is referred to in various contexts, and in Megido, the Negev, and other sites in Israel, recently found iconographic remnants show dancing figures. In Judg. 21:21, a festival is described during which it was customary to dance in the vineyards. Dancing was also associated with celebrations of military victories and for welcoming home heroes. In Exod. 15:20, Miriam and the other women burst into song and dance accompanied by drums to mark the parting of the Red Sea which saved the people of Israel; Jephtah's daughter danced to meet her father returning from victorious battles (Judg. 11:34); the women of Israel came out to dance before Saul and David upon their return from fighting the Philistines (1 Sam. 18:6); the king and his subjects were also inspired to dance when the Ark of the Covenant was brought up to Jerusalem (2 Sam. Ch. 6).&lt;ref name=Shiloah&gt;Shiloah, Amnon. ''Jewish Musical Traditions'', Wayne State Univ. (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|210}}

==Musical traditions==

===Purposes of music===
The Bible mentions many uses of music including songs of praise, songs of victory, songs of mourning, and above all the Psalms. Dances were also a common music expression along with the combination of singing with instrumental music. During later times there was also a purely vocal music which prevailed for a period.&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt; According to Ulrich, music played an important part in both the secular and the religious life of the Hebrews. Kings and other leaders of the people were customarily acclaimed in songs and fanfares, and very elaborate musical services in the Temple, described in the Bible, were important parts of worship. There are, for instance, descriptions in the Bible of an orchestra consisting of nine lutes, two harps, and a cymbal.&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt; In other parts there are accounts of all-women choirs combined with singing and dancing to the men's percussion accompaniment. Werner adds that the choir's repertoire consisted of psalms, canticles, and other poetic passages from Scripture, although it may have contained some noncanonical texts. The choice of psalms is said to have been determined by God's activities on the first seven days of creation, and the verses which allude to them.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|13}}

Werner writes that "unique in the history of music is the firm belief in the purifying and sin-atoning power of the Temple's music, ascribed to both chant and instruments."&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt; The music had to be free from blemish or fault, and avoided magical elements. Even the High Priest's garment had symbolism: (Exod. 28:34–35): "a golden bell and a pomegranate, round about on the skirts of the robe . . . and its sound shall be heard when he goes into the holy place before the Lord . . . " According to Philo and Josephus, the bells represented symbols of cosmic harmony.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|10}}

===Music training===
According to the text of the Mishna, the early musicians, both singers and instrumentalists, were strictly trained to be professional musicians with their average training lasting five years. Bible historian Alfred Sendrey notes a "sudden and unexplained upsurge of large [[choir]]s and orchestras, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation." This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] was the [[patriarch]] of a school which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class—which is how the shepherd boy [[David]] appears on the scene as a minstrel to [[King Saul]]." :"&lt;ref name=JRT&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004134128/http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html "A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional"] ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of music===
Different types of music were also defined:&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt; 
*'''Cantillation.''' Used when parts of the Bible were read during the service and parts of the text were sung or chanted.
*'''Antiphony''' (also referred to as responsorial singing). Since Hebrew poetry is based on parallelism (the expression of one thought in two different ways), several types of performances were possible: either by two separate alternating choruses, or by a soloist alternating with the chorus. At its peak around the beginning of the Christian era, antiphonal music was performed by a large choir of highly trained men singers, with boys sometimes added. According to Hindley, "Antiphony is among the debts owed by Christian music to its Jewish predecessor."&lt;ref name=Hindley/&gt;
*'''Hymn songs.''' Within the service they were performed by either a soloist, called the cantor, or by groups. Some of the hymns were freely organized with groups of melodic [[motive (music)|motives]] with their variants connected to create a continuous melodic chant.
*'''Orchestration.''' Werner writes that "the sound of the Temple's orchestra consisted of never less than twelve instruments and rarely exceeded thirty-six." The trumpets were never mixed with the rest of the orchestra—being used for signals exclusively. One pair of cymbals were used in Temple rituals also as a signal instrument, "not unlike the gong in the modern theatre."&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;

===Written notation===
Musical notation in the modern sense did not exist during this period. However, the Hebrew alphabet allows for special symbols to indicate how the music was to be performed. The alphabet consists of consonants and half-consonants, and vowels are indicated by dots and dashes above and below letter symbols. In addition to the vowel signs, a number of other signs, called "[[Tiberian vocalization|masoretic]]," refers not to single notes but to "melodic particles or groups," writes Ulrich. These particles were handed down by oral tradition among singers for centuries and were first codified in the 16th century. Ulrich notes that the "Dead Sea Scrolls contain signs similar to those in the liturgical script of early Christian sects . . . strengthening the conjecture that a common musical heritage is shared by the people of related cultures . . ."&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt;

==Influence on later music==
Music historian William Smoldon notes that despite the fact that instrumental music was not revived and used in the synagogue after the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 AD, (excluding the symbolic [[Shofar]] still used in orthodox communities,) "the [[chant]] continued, and of late years research has made it increasingly clear that many of the forms and even melodic patterns of the [[Byzantine]] and Western Christian chants were adaptations from the music of the synagogues."&lt;ref name=Smoldon&gt;Smoldon, William. ''A History of Music'', Dimension Books, Inc. (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

He also notes that after the collapse of the Western [[Roman Empire]], the "one steadfast feature was the Western Christian Church" which was "respected by the [[barbarians]]." He adds that there seems "little doubt that the worship-music of the early Church, i.e. at such centres as [[Jerusalem]], [[Damascus]], [[Antioch]] and [[Alexandria]], grew from materials . . . of Greek and Syrian origins, together with the service-chants of the Jewish synagogue."&lt;ref name=Smoldon/&gt;{{rp|20}}

;Psalms
The [[Psalms]] have been sung through all the ages up to the present. Whitcomb describes the importance of the Psalms:
:"the [[Crusades|Crusader]] has chanted them as he ascended the Hill of [[Zion]]; and the victorious general was welcomed on his return by a hallelujah chorus. The sailor on the dark night at sea, the shepherd on the lonely plain, the little waif upon the street, have alike been cheered by the music of the Psalms. They have enlivened the vintage-feast, the boatman on the Rhine, the soldier by his camp-fire have been softened and the sad have been cheered by these sweet inspirations to faith, [[penitence]], thanksgiving, and adoration."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;

Lockyer writes that [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the Holy Roman Emperor and champion of the pope, requested passages from his favorite psalm, Ps. 90, be read to him as he lay on his deathbed in September 1558. In that psalm, "[[Moses]] contrasts the eternity of God with the transience of human life, and Moses ends his song with a prayer for God's forgiveness and favor."(Ps 90:1–6)&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|21}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1698">'''HCISec''' is the study of interaction between humans and computers, or [[human–computer interaction]], specifically as it pertains to [[information security]].  Its aim, in plain terms, is to improve the [[usability]] of security features in [[end user]] applications.  

Unlike HCI, which has roots in the early days of [[Xerox PARC]] during the 1970s, HCISec is a nascent field of study by comparison. Interest in this topic tracks with that of [[Internet security]], which has become an area of broad public concern only in very recent years.

When security features exhibit poor usability, the following are common reasons:

* they were added in casual afterthought
* they were hastily patched in to address newly discovered [[security bug]]s
* they address very complex [[use case]]s without the benefit of a [[Wizard (software)|software wizard]]
* their interface designers lacked understanding of related security concepts
* their interface designers were not usability experts (often meaning they were the application developers themselves)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1767">The '''laminar sublayer''', also called the '''viscous sublayer''', is the region of a mainly-[[turbulence|turbulent]] flow that is near a [[No-slip condition|no-slip boundary]] and in which the flow is [[Laminar flow|laminar]]. As such, it is a type of [[boundary layer]]. The existence of the laminar sublayer can be understood in that the flow velocity decreases towards the no-slip boundary. Because of this, the [[Reynolds number]] decreases until at some point the flow crosses the threshold from turbulent to laminar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imc.pcz.czest.pl/instytut/pl/3/3.8/materialy/afm_bl/afm_bl4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;http://www.personal.kent.edu/~amoore5/FST_L_6a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The laminar sublayer is important for river-bed [[ecology]]: below the laminar-turbulent interface, the flow is stratified, but above it, it rapidly becomes well-mixed. This threshold can be important in providing homes and feeding grounds for [[benthic]] organisms.&lt;ref&gt;journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid...&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the roughness due to the bed sediment or other factors are smaller or larger than this sublayer has an important bearing in [[hydraulics]] and [[sediment transport]]. Flow is defined as [[hydraulically rough flow|hydraulically rough]] if the roughness elements are larger than the laminar sublayer (thereby perturbing the flow), and as [[hydraulically smooth flow|hydraulically smooth]] if they are smaller than the laminar sublayer (and therefore ignorable by the main body of the flow).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.personal.kent.edu/~amoore5/FST_L_6a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved 2011-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt; is a termination of [[pregnancy]] that is performed during a later stage of pregnancy. Late termination of pregnancy is [[Abortion in the United States#By trimester of pregnancy|more controversial]] than abortion in general because it results in the death of a [[fetus]] that is more developed and sometimes [[fetal viability|able to survive independently]]. Given the complex, gradual nature of [[human fetal development]], the definition of "late" in this context is not precise, and different medical publications have discussed the varying [[gestational age]] points that can be involved.

==Definition==
A late termination of pregnancy often refers to an induced ending of pregnancy after the [[Gestational age|20th week]] of [[gestation]]. The exact point when a pregnancy becomes late-term, however, is not clearly defined. Some sources define an abortion after 16 weeks as "late".&lt;ref name="Torres"&gt;Torres, Aida and Forrest, Jacqueline Darroch. (1988). [http://www.holysmoke.org/fem/fem0543.htm Why Do Women Have Abortions]. ''Family Planning Perspectives, 20 (4)'', 169-176. Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weihe, Pál, Steuerwald, Ulrike,  Taheri, Sepideh, Færø, Odmar, Veyhe, Anna Sofía, &amp; Nicolajsen, Did. (2003). [http://www2.mst.dk/udgiv/publications/2003/87-7972-477-9/pdf/87-7972-478-7.pdf The Human Health Programme in the Faroe Islands 1985-2001]. In ''AMAP Greenland and the Faroe Islands 1997-2001''. Danish Ministry of Environment. Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Three articles published in 1998 in the same issue of the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' could not agree on the definition. Two of the ''JAMA'' articles chose the 20th week of gestation to be the point where an abortion procedure would be considered late-term.&lt;ref&gt;Sprang, M.L, and Neerhof, M.G. (1998). [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/280/8/744 Rationale for banning abortions late in pregnancy]. ''Journal of the American Medical Association, 280 (8),'' 744-747.&lt;br /&gt;Grimes, D.A. (1998). [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/280/8/747 The continuing need for late abortions]. ''Journal of the American Medical Association, 280 (8)'', 747-750.&lt;/ref&gt; The third ''JAMA'' article chose the third trimester, or 27th week of gestation.&lt;ref name="Jama2"&gt;Gans Epner, J.E., Jonas, H.S., Seckinger, D.L. (1998). [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/280/8/724 Late-term abortion]. ''Journal of the American Medical Association, 280 (8)'', 724-729.&lt;/ref&gt;

The point at which an abortion becomes late-term is often related to the "[[Fetus#Viability|viability]]" (ability to survive outside the [[uterus]]) of the [[fetus]]. Sometimes late-term abortions are referred to as post-viability abortions.

==Mental health==
While a single first-trimester abortion carried no more mental health risk than carrying a pregnancy to term, abortion could not be proven safe in other cases as far as mental health was concerned. Women who terminate a pregnancy because of abnormalities discovered through fetal screenings have a similar risk of negative mental health outcomes as women who miscarry a wanted pregnancy or experience a stillbirth or the death of a newborn. However, "the differing patterns of psychological experiences observed among women who terminate an unplanned pregnancy versus those who terminate a planned and wanted pregnancy highlight the importance of taking pregnancy intendedness and wantedness into account when seeking to understand psychological reactions to abortion."&lt;ref name="apa-2008"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/abortion/index.aspx | title = Mental Health and Abortion | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | year = 2008 | accessdate = April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study from 2013 found that most women seeking late-term abortion "fit at least one of five profiles: They were raising children alone, were depressed or using illicit substances, were in conflict with a male partner or experiencing domestic violence, had trouble deciding and then had access problems, or were young and nulliparous."  The study data did not include any women who were having abortions "on grounds of fetal anomaly or life endangerment." The researchers concluded that "Bans on abortion after 20 weeks will disproportionately affect young women and women with limited financial resources."&lt;ref name=Foster2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=Diana|title=Who Seeks Abortions at or After 20 Weeks?|journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|date=December 2013|volume=45|issue=4|pages=210–218|doi=10.1363/4521013|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/4521013.html|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an earlier study published in 1987, the Alan Guttmacher Institute collected questionnaires from 1,900 women in the United States who came to clinics to have abortions. Of the 1,900 questioned, 420 had been pregnant for 16 or more weeks. These 420 women were asked to choose among a list of reasons they had not obtained the abortions earlier in their pregnancies.  The results were as follows:&lt;ref name="Torres" /&gt;
* 71% of women were unaware they were pregnant or misjudged gestation
* 48% of women found it hard to make arrangements for abortion
* 33% of women were afraid to tell their partner or parents
* 24% of women took longer to decide whether to have an abortion
* 8% of women had an abortion after a change in their relationship status
* 8% of women were initially pressured not to have abortion
* 6% of women chose to have an abortion because of a change in circumstances after becoming pregnant
* 6% of women were not properly educated on how timing affects abortion
* 5% of women were unaware that abortion was available to them
* 2% A fetal problem was diagnosed late in pregnancy
* 11% Other

=== England and Wales ===
The NHS records the reasons given for abortions at all stages of development. In 2015, 2,877 abortions were performed at 20 weeks or above. Of these, 23 (0.8%)&lt;!-- Ground A (alone, or with B, C, D) or F or G  --&gt; were performed to save the life of the pregnant woman, 1,801&lt;!-- C (alone) --&gt; (63%) were performed for mental or physical health reasons, and 1046&lt;!-- Ground E (alone, or with A, B, C or D)  --&gt; (36%) were performed because of foetal abnormalities. (The data do not sum up to 100% because multiple reasons could be recorded for each abortion.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/529344/Abortion_Statistics_2015_v3.pdf|title=Report on abortion statistics in England and Wales for 2015|last=Department of Health|first=|date=17 May 2016|issue=|doi=|volume=|page=31 (Table 7b)|pmid=|access-date=2016-10-24|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal restrictions==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Intact dilation and extraction]] --&gt;
As of 1998, among the 152 most populous countries, 54 either banned abortion entirely or permitted it only to save the life of the pregnant woman.&lt;ref name="Global"&gt;Anika Rahman, Laura Katzive and Stanley K. Henshaw. [http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2405698.pdf A Global Review of Laws on Induced Abortion, 1985-1997], International Family Planning Perspectives (Volume 24, Number 2, June 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, 49 of the 152 most populous countries were without restriction as to reason, but 44 of these imposed limits after a particular [[gestational age]]:&lt;ref name="Global" /&gt;

* 12 weeks (Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cuba, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Georgia, Greece, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Rep., Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Norway, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Ukraine, Tajikistan,  Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan)
* 13 weeks (Italy)
* 14 weeks (Austria, Cambodia, Germany, Hungary, and Romania)
* 18 weeks (Sweden)
* 24 weeks (Singapore)
* no limit (Canada, China, and North Korea)
* viability (Netherlands and to some extent the United States)

In these countries, abortions after the general gestational age limit are allowed only under restricted circumstances, which include, depending on country, risk to the woman's life, physical or mental health, fetal malformation, cases where the pregnancy was the result of rape, or poor socio-economic conditions. For instance, in Italy, abortion is allowed on request up until 90 days, after which it is allowed only if the pregnancy or childbirth pose a threat to the woman’s life, a risk to physical health of the woman, a risk to mental health of the woman; if there is a risk of fetal malformation; or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or other sexual crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ippfen.org/NR/rdonlyres/2EB28750-BA71-43F8-AE2A-8B55A275F86C/0/Abortion_legislation_Europe_Jan2007.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313162004/http://www.ippfen.org/NR/rdonlyres/2EB28750-BA71-43F8-AE2A-8B55A275F86C/0/Abortion_legislation_Europe_Jan2007.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark provides a wider range of reasons, including social and economic ones, which can be invoked by a woman who seeks an abortion after 12 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/population/abortion/Denmark.abo.htm|title=DENMARK|author=|date=|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortions at such stages must in general be approved by a doctor or a special committee, unlike early abortions which are performed on demand. The ease with which the doctor or the committee allows a late term abortion varies significantly by country, and is often influenced by the social and religious views prevalent in that region.

Some countries, like Canada, China (Mainland only) and Vietnam have no legal limit on when an abortion can be performed.&lt;ref name="Global" /&gt;

===United States===
{{See also|Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act}}
The [[United States Supreme Court]] decisions on abortion, including ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'',  allow states to impose more restrictions on post-viability abortions than during the earlier stages of pregnancy.

As of December 2014, forty-two states had bans on late-term abortions that were not [[Facial challenge|facially]] unconstitutional under ''Roe v. Wade'' or [[enjoined]] by court order.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;Guttmacher Institute. (April 1, 2007). [http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_PLTA.pdf State Policies on Later-Term Abortions]. ''State Policies in Brief.''  Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' ruled that Congress may ban certain late-term abortion techniques, "both previability and postviability",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Annas|first1=George J.|title=The Supreme Court and Abortion Rights|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=24 May 2007|volume=2007|issue=356|pages=2201–2207|doi=10.1056/NEJMhle072595|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMhle072595|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it had done in banning [[intact dilation and extraction]] with the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hern|first1=Warren M.|title=Did I violate the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2003/10/did_i_violate_the_partialbirth_abortion_ban.html|accessdate=27 October 2017|work=Slate.com|date=22 Oct 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court has held that bans must include exceptions for threats to the woman's life, physical health, and mental health, but four states allow late-term abortions only when the woman's life is at risk; four allow them when the woman's life or physical health is at risk, but use a definition of health that pro-choice organizations believe is impermissibly narrow.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;  Note that just because a portion of a state's law is found to be unconstitutional does not mean that the entire law will be deemed unconstitutional: "[I]nvalidating the statute entirely is not always necessary or justified, for lower courts may be able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief," meaning the court could declare that only those parts of the law that are violative of the Constitution are invalid (declaratory relief), or that the court can prohibit the state from enforcing those portions of the law (injunctive relief).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/04-1144.html 546 U.S. 320] (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteen states prohibit abortion after a certain number of weeks' gestation (usually 22 weeks from the last menstrual period).&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;  The U.S. Supreme Court held in ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]]'' that a statute may create "a presumption of viability" after a certain number of weeks, in which case the physician must be given an opportunity to rebut the presumption by performing tests.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster v. Reproductive Health Services'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=492&amp;invol=490 492 U.S. 490] (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Because this provision is not explicitly written into these state laws, as it was in the Missouri law examined in ''Webster'', pro-choice organizations believe that such a state law is unconstitutional, but only "to the extent that it prohibits pre-viability abortions".&lt;ref name="Delaware"&gt;NARAL Pro-Choice America. (2007). "[http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/choice-action-center/in_your_state/who-decides/state-profiles/delaware.html?templateName=lawdetails&amp;issueID=3&amp;ssumID=2516 Delaware]."  ''Who Decides? The Status of Women's Reproductive Rights in the United States.'' Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten states (although Florida's enforcement of such laws are under [[permanent injunction]]) require a second physician's approval before a late-term abortion can be performed.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;  The U.S. Supreme Court struck down a requirement of "confirmation by two other physicians" (rather than one other physician) because "acquiescence by co-practitioners has no rational connection with a patient's needs and unduly infringes on the physician's right to practice".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=410&amp;invol=179 410 U.S. 179] (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-choice organizations, such as the [[Guttmacher Institute]], posit that some of these state laws are unconstitutional, based on these and other Supreme Court rulings, at least to the extent that these state laws require approval of a second or third physician.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;

Thirteen states have laws that require a second physician to be present during late-term abortion procedures in order to treat a fetus if born alive.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt; The Court has held that a doctor's right to practice is not infringed by requiring a second physician to be present at abortions performed after viability in order to assist in the case of a living fetus.&lt;ref&gt;''Planned Parenthood Ass'n v. Ashcroft'', [http://supreme.justia.com/us/462/476/case.html 462 U.S. 476], 486-90 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
There are at least four medical procedures associated with late-term abortions:
* [[Dilation and evacuation]] (D&amp;E)
* Early [[labor induction]] (sometimes called "induction abortion")
* [[Intact dilation and extraction]] (IDX or D&amp;X), sometimes referred to as "[[Partial birth abortion#Partial-birth abortion|''partial-birth abortion'']]"
* [[Hysterotomy abortion]]

==Viability==
There is no sharp limit of development, age, or weight at which humans automatically become viable.&lt;ref name="developinghuman"&gt;Moore, Keith and Persaud, T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8645">'''Military art''' ({{ lang-fr|L'Art de la Guerre}}) (lit. art of war) is a field of [[Military theory|theoretical research]] and [[Military education and training|training]] methodology in [[military science]] used in the [[conduct of military operation]]s on land, in the maritime or air environments. Military art includes the study and application of the [[principles of warfare]] and [[laws of war]] that apply equally to the closely interrelated [[military strategy]], [[operational mobility|operational art]] and [[military tactics|tactics]]. Exercise of military art is highly dependent on the [[economics]] and [[logistics]] supporting the [[armed forces]], their [[military technology and equipment]], and reflects the social influences on the [[military organisation]] exercising military art. Often misunderstood due to its 19th-century perception as generally "including the entire subject of war",&lt;ref&gt;p.37, Halleck&lt;/ref&gt; it is primarily, as the term implies, the expression of [[creative thinking]] on the part of the [[Decision making|decision-makers]] in employing their forces,&lt;ref&gt;p.140, De La Barre Duparcq&lt;/ref&gt; with the map of the area of operations as a veritable [[Canvas#Canvas for painting|canvas]], and the movement of forces commonly marked on the map with arrows, as [[brush stroke]]s. Less imaginatively it was defined in France during the 19th century as &lt;blockquote&gt;
The art of war is the art of concentrating and employing, at the opportune moment, a superior force of troops upon the decisive point.&lt;ref&gt;p.7, De La Barre Duparcq&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; and &lt;blockquote&gt;
The art of divining the intention of the enemy from slight indications is one which rarely misleads, and is one of the most precious attributes of [[military genius]].&lt;ref&gt;p.294, De La Barre Duparcq&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is not well known that many of the greatest military leaders in Europe and Asia, notably Japan, were themselves either accomplished [[artist]]s, or [[Art collector|collectors of art]].

In history, schools of thinking about military art can be divided during the ancient and medieval periods by the influence of [[infantry]] troops on tactics in Europe, and [[cavalry]] on tactics in [[Asia]], and the period commencing with the [[Early Modern period]] when firearms and artillery increasingly influenced employment of forces. The need for mobility, opportunity and decisiveness have tended to associate military art with offensive manoeuvre, cavalry, and therefore, before advent of late-19th century firearms, Asia.&lt;ref&gt;p.97, De La Barre Duparcq&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe military art was primarily concerned with time of [[combat]], understanding the best way an [[occupied position]] can enhance [[Defense (military)|defensive potential]] of a small [[field army]] largely consisting of relatively [[Mobility (military)|low mobility]] troops, by often using [[high ground]], terrain [[choke point]]s or [[field entrenchment]]s. Due to relative lack of economic and logistic support, European military art theorists advocated [[Battle#Types|decisive battles]] that could bring a [[military campaign]] to a quick conclusion, thus reducing the economic cost of [[war]], notably through the [[shock tactics]] of the [[armoured cavalry]].
In Asia, due to a more developed and widespread [[horse breeding]] offering enhanced mobility, military art developed a more [[Offensive (military)|offensive-based]] way of thinking about military tactics, and military art was dominated by considerations of choosing [[point of attack]] and [[military communications]].

The confrontation between these two forms of military art that took place as a result of the [[Crusades]] and the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]], and the contemporaneous introduction of [[artillery]] into warfare significantly changed thinking about military art in Europe, leading to wide-ranging experiments in [[tactical formation]] of troops, use of [[combined arms]] and exercise of [[maneuver warfare]] concepts and methods not only in tactics, but on a larger scale, including in use of naval forces. This later led to creation of European [[colonial empire]]s.

Although European military art on land can be argued not to have reached its developed stage until the 19th century in the attempt to defeat [[linear tactics]] that led to the [[First World War]],&lt;ref&gt;p. 115, Halleck&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimate sophistication during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and the [[Cold War]], great increases in the [[firepower]] of the European [[firearms]] and artillery were usually able to negate greater number and mobility of the Asian field forces, no-where more illustrated than during the [[French Invasion of Egypt (1798)|French Invasion of Egypt]] in 1798. The defining application of firepower and manoeuvre in military art became expressed during the conduct of [[strategic operations of the Red Army in World War II]] that sought to combine the shock of [[armoured warfare]] with mobility, and the traditional reliance on infantry in strengthened positions to first stop the German advances and during [[counter-attack]]s to achieve [[Breakthrough (military)|breakthrough]] of the enemy position, and in conducting [[deep operations]] to destroy the logistic support, literally starving German troops of supplies and ammunition, and forcing them to [[Surrender (military)|surrender]].

Military art in [[naval warfare]] likewise developed along the considerations of position versus speed, initially through use of [[galley]]s and later during the [[Age of Sail]]. However, increasingly [[naval tactics]] became dominated by the relative firepower of individual vessels, and this was demonstrated during the epic [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. The use of naval forces in military art significantly expanded the [[scale of conflict]]s to global ranges. For much of the 19th and 20th centuries naval military art became concerned primarily with the firepower and the ability of ships to withstand it through use of increasing their [[armour]] until the introduction of [[naval aviation]] into consideration of [[naval battle]]s and [[naval strategy]].

Introduction of aircraft into [[warfare]] drastically altered the 19th century understanding of military art, and application of its principles. [[Aerial warfare]] became the ultimate solution to manoeuvre in delivery of firepower, and drastically increased the [[tempo of conflict]]s, making [[blitzkrieg]] possible during the Second World War. Aerial warfare also finally negated the advantage of a [[defensive position]] which left the defender as an easily detected and attacked target for the [[bomber]]s. While German [[industrial centres]] became just such targets for the Allied [[strategic bombing during World War II]], on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] the Soviet [[Red Army]] chose to adapt by developing concepts and methods suggested by theorists during the [[interwar period]] to a more offensive-based and dynamic conduct of operations coordinating ground and [[air offensive]]s.

The final development in military art came with the increased influence of the [[electronics]] and its implications for the ability by infantry to halt the breakthroughs using increasingly powerful [[infantry support weapon]]s, and the effect on the [[military communications]] by a new form of combat, [[electronic warfare]]. The potential of losing ability to exercise [[command and control]] over forces, particularly strategically significant forces, completely undermined much of the theoretical thinking of the Cold War. Some have argued that this was one of the factors, along with those of economic considerations, that eventually led to the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]], and [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)#Dissolution of the USSR|Dissolution of the USSR]].

Since the end of the Cold War in Europe, application of military art has been sought primarily by conventional forces in combat operations against unconventional opponents, and this has many attempts to review [[military history]] in the effort to find solutions to successful conduct of operations against these forces.

A '''natural region''' is a basic geographic unit. Usually it is a [[region]] which is distinguished by its common natural features of [[geography]], [[geology]], and [[climate]]. 

From the [[ecology|ecological]] point of view, the naturally occurring flora and fauna of the region are likely to be influenced by its geographical and geological factors, such as [[soil]] and [[water resources|water availability]], in a significant manner. Thus most natural regions are homogeneous [[ecosystem]]s. Human impact can be an important factor in the shaping and destiny of a particular natural region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1739/ UNESCO - Natural and Cultural Landscape of Danube Region]&lt;/ref&gt;
There are 11 major regions in the world.

The concept "natural region" may refer to a large, poor area, or to a large basic geographical unit, like the vast [[boreal forest]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/natural-regions Natural Regions - The Canadian Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; The term may also be used generically, like in [[alpine tundra]], or specifically to refer to a particular place.

The term is particularly useful where there is no corresponding or coterminous official region. [[The Fens]] of eastern [[England]], the [[Thai highlands]], and the [[Pays de Bray]] in Normandy, are examples of this. Others might include regions with particular geological characteristics, like [[badlands]], such as the [[Bardenas Reales]], an upland [[massif]] of acidic rock, or [[The Burren]], in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

The '''Network Test Automation Forum (NTAF)''', founded in 2010, is a nonprofit international industry alliance, dedicated to promoting interoperability of commercial network testing tools and testing infrastructure, by defining and facilitating adoption of technical specifications.

The forum is composed of leading service providers, network equipment vendors, and other networking companies that share an interest in test automation and interoperability. As of November 2012, it has 14 members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntaforum.org/members/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2009, 11 founding members (BreakingPoint, [[BT Group|BT]], [[Cisco]], [[Fanfare]], [[Empirix]], [[Ericsson]], [[EXFO]], [[Ixia]], [[JDSU]], [[Spirent]] and [[Verizon]]) met in Chicago and expressed an interest in forming an industry alliance to bring together commercial testing vendors, test equipment vendors, and other industry experts to create interoperable testing solutions for service providers, network equipment manufacturers (NEMs), and other enterprise organizations with large network deployments. The result was the Network Test Automation Forum entity, which was set up in 2010 following the first face-to-face meeting in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fanfaresoftware.com/news-and-events/press-releases/global-companies-demand-testing-interoperability&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiercetelecom.com/story/network-test-automation-forum-addresses-time-market-pressures/2010-03-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lightwaveonline.com/articles/2010/03/network-test-automation-forum-launches-advocates-collaboration-and-interoperability-of-vendor-test-tools--87980227.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goal==
To facilitate and promote the interoperability of commercial testing tools and test infrastructure for the data communications and telecommunications industry.

NTAF will bring together commercial testing vendors, test equipment vendors, and other industry experts to create interoperable testing solutions for service providers, network equipment manufacturers (NEMs), and other enterprise organizations with large network deployments.

==Objectives==
The objectives of NTAF are:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntaforum.org/about/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Build consensus and unite service providers, network equipment manufacturers, and test equipment vendors on network test automation technical specifications and interoperability.
* Create, facilitate and enable the implementation of network test automation specifications.
* Enhance market awareness of the benefits of interoperable network test automation.

==Members==
As of July 2013, NTAF has the following members:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntaforum.org/members/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
In June 2011, NTAF ratified two sets of specifications dealing with registration, discovery and activation of tools and defining tool harnesses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eetimes.com/design/industrial-control/4218488/Network-test-specs-promote-multi-vendor-interoperability-in-the-lab?Ecosystem=industrial-control&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4216721/NTAF-releases-specification-for-network-test-automation?Ecosystem=test-and-measurement&lt;/ref&gt;

===TS-001: Tool Registration, Discovery and Activation===
This specification describes an XMPP extension that allows an application or tool to register itself in a way that other interested entities can discover its existence. It also describes the mechanism by which a tool can be activated so that its automation harnesses are available for use.

===TS-002: Tool Automation Harness===
This specification describes an XMPP extension that allows an application or tool, with or without its own specialized man-machine user interface to expose an "automation harness" that allows that tool to be controlled and/or monitored by another tool via XMPP packet exchanges.

==Future Direction==
The NTAF Technical Committee is currently working on draft specifications for resource and inventory management:

===WT-003: Tool Resource===
This working document describes an NTAF extension that allows tools to communicate resource data. It is based on the TS-001 and TS-002 specifications and its primary focus is to support automated inventory management.

===WT-004: Inventory===
This working document describes an NTAF extension that supports the automatic population of inventory records with key equipment/resource parameters within a test lab environment. It is based on the TS-001 and TS002 specifications and the WT-003 proposal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10957">'''Partial concurrent thinking aloud''' (or '''partial concurrent think-aloud''', or '''PCTA''') is a method used to gather data in [[usability testing]] with [[screen reader]] users. It is a particular kind of [[think aloud protocol]] (or TAP) created by Stefano Federici and Simone Borsci&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Borsci, S., &amp; Federici, S. |  year = 2009 |  chapter = The Partial Concurrent Thinking Aloud: A New Usability Evaluation Technique for Blind Users |editor1=P.

Salminen |title = Assistive technology from adapted equipment to inclusive environments |  volume = 25 |  pages = 421–425 | publisher = IOS Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Interuniversity Center for Research on Cognitive Processing in Natural and Artificial Systems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w3.uniroma1.it/econa/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210202829/http://w3.uniroma1.it/econa/ |archivedate=2010-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of University of Rome "La Sapienza". The partial concurrent thinking aloud is built up in order to create a specific usability assessment technique for blind users, eligible to maintain the advantages of concurrent and retrospective thinking aloud while overcoming their limits. Using PCTA blind users' verbalizations of problems could be more pertinent and comparable to those given by sighted people who use a concurrent protocol. In the usability evaluation with blind people, the retrospective thinking aloud is often adopted as a functional solution to overcome the structural interference due to thinking aloud and hearing the screen reader imposed by the classic thinking aloud technique; such a solution has yet a relapse in the evaluation method, because the concurrent and the retrospective protocols measure usability from different points of view, one mediated by navigation experience (retrospective) one more direct and pertinent (concurrent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Federici, S., Borsci, S., &amp; Stamerra, G. |  year = Accepted November 2009 |  pages = 263–72 | title = Web usability evaluation with screen reader users: implementation of the partial concurrent thinking aloud technique |  volume = 11 | journal = Cognitive processing | doi = 10.1007/s10339-009-0347-y |  issue = 3 |  pmid = 19916036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of PCTA could be widened to both summative and formative usability evaluations with mixed panels of users, thus extending the number of problems' verbalizations according to disabled users' divergent navigation processes and problem solving strategies.

==Cognitive assumptions==

In general, in the usability evaluation both retrospective and concurrent TAP could be used according to the aims and goals of the study. Nevertheless, when a usability evaluation is carried out with blind people several studies propose to use the retrospective TAP: indeed, using a [[screen reader]] and talking about the way of interacting with the computer implies a structural interference between action and verbalization. Undoubtedly, cognitive studies provided a lot of evidence supporting the idea that individuals can listen, verbalize, or manipulate, and rescue information in multiple task condition. As [[Colin Cherry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |  doi = 10.1121/1.1907229 |  author = Cherry, E.C. |year = 1953 |
 title = Some experiments on the recognition of speech, with one and with two ears | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |  volume = 25 |   issue = 5 |   pages = 975–979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed, subjects, when listening to two different messages from a single loudspeaker, can separate sounds from background noise, recognize the gender of the speaker, the direction, and the pitch ([[cocktail party effect]]). At the same time, subjects that must verbalize the content of a message (attended message) listening to two different message simultaneously (attended and unattended message) have a reduced ability to report the content of the attended massage, while they are unable to report the content of the unattended message. Moreover, K. [[Anders Ericsson]] and [[Walter Kintsch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.102.2.211 | author = Ericsson, K.A., Kintsch, W. | year = 1995 | title = Long-Term Working Memory | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 102 |issue = 2 |  pages = 211–245 | pmid = 7740089 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that, in a multiple task condition, subjects' ability of rescuing information is not compromised by an interruption of the action flow (as it happens in the concurrent thinking aloud technique), thanks to the “Long Term Working Memory mechanism” of information retrieval ([[Working Memory]] section Ericsson and Kintsch). 
Even if users can listen, recognize, and verbalize multiple messages in a multiple task condition and they can stop and restart actions without losing any information, other cognitive studies underlined that the overlap of activities in a multiple task condition have an effect on the goal achievement: Kemper, Herman and Lian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.18.2.181 | author = Kemper, S., Herman, R.E., &amp; Lian, C.H.T. | year = 2003 | title = The Costs of Doing Two Things at Once for Young and Older Adults: Talking While Walking, Finger Tapping, and Ignoring Speech or Noise | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 18 |issue = 2 |  pages = 181–192 | pmid = 12825768 }}&lt;/ref&gt; analysing the users' abilities to verbalize actions in a multiple task condition, showed that the fluency of a user's conversation is influenced by the overlap of actions. Adults are likely to continue to talk as they navigate in a complex physical environment. However, the fluency of their conversation is likely to change: Older adults are likely to speak more slowly than they would if resting; Young adults continue to speak just as rapidly while walking as while resting, but they adopt a further set of speech accommodations, reducing sentence length, grammatical complexity, and propositional density. Just by reducing length, complexity, and propositional density adults free up working memory resources.
We do not know how and how much the content of verbalizations could be influenced by the strategy of verbalization (i.e. the modification of fluency and the complexity in a multiple task condition). Anyway, we well know that users in the concurrent thinking aloud verbalize the problems in a more accurate and pertinent way (i.e. more focused on the problems directly perceived during the interaction) then in the retrospective one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bowers, V.A  |author2=Snyder, H.L. |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 2003 | title = Concurrent versus retrospective verbal protocols for comparing window usability | publisher = Human Factors Society 34th Meeting, 8–12 October 1990 HFES, Santa Monica | pages = 1270–1274 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Van den Haak, M.J.  |author2=De Jong, M.D.T.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 2003 | title = Exploring Two Methods of Usability Testing: Concurrent versus Retrospective Think-Aloud Protocols | publisher = IEEE International Professional Communication Conference Proceedings Piscataway, New Jersey }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pertinence is granted to the user by the proximity of action-verbalization-next action; this multiple task proximity compels the subject to apply a strategy of verbalization that reduce the overload of the working memory. However, for blind users this time proximity between action and verbalization is lost: the use of the screen reader, in fact, increase the time for verbalization (i.e. in order to verbalize, blind users must first stop the [screen reader] and then restart it).

==Protocol==
PCTA method is composed of two sections, one concurrent and one retrospective:

The first section is a modified concurrent protocol built up according to the three concurrent verbal protocols criteria described by K. [[Anders Ericsson]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.87.3.215 | author = Ericsson, K.A., Simon, H.A. | year = 1980 | title = Verbal reports as data | journal = Psychological Review | volume =87 | issue = 3| pages = 215–251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Ericsson, K.A., Simon, H.A. | year = 1993 | title =Protocol analysis: Verbal reports as data (Revised edition)| publisher =MIT Press Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! The first criterion
|-
| Subjects should be talking about the task at hand, not about an unrelated issue. In order to respect this rule, the time between problem retrieval, thinking and verbalization must be minimized to avoid the influence of a long perceptual reworking and the consequent verbalization of unrelated issues. Blind participants, using a screen reader, increase the time latency between identification and verbalization of a problem. To minimize this latency, users are trained to ring a desk-bell that stops both time and navigation. During this suspension, users can create a memory sign (i.e. ring the bell) and restart immediately the navigation. This setting modification allows to avoid the cognitive limitation problem and the influence of perceptual reworking, also creating a memory sign for the retrospective analysis.
|-
! The second criterion 
|-
| To be pertinent, verbalizations should be logically consistent with the verbalizations that just preceded them. For any kind of user it is hard to be pertinent and consistent in a concurrent verbal protocol. Therefore, the practitioners could generally interrupt  the navigation and ask for a clarification or stimulate the users to verbalize in a pertinent way. In order to do so and stop navigation to screen reader users, we propose to negotiate a specific physical sign with them: The practitioner, sitting behind the user, will put his hand on the user's shoulder. This physical sign grants the verbalization pertinence and consistence.
|-
! The third criterion
|-
| A subset of the information needed during the task performance should be remembered. The concurrent model is based on the link between working memory and time latency. The proximity between the occurrence of a thought and its verbal report allows users to verbalize on the basis of their working memory.
|-
|}

The second PCTA section is a retrospective one in which users analyse those problems previously verbalized in a concurrent way. The memory signs, created by users ringing the desk-bell, overcome the limits of classic retrospective analysis; indeed, these signs allow the users to be pertinent and consistent with their concurrent verbalization, thus avoiding the influence of long term memory and perceptual reworking.

[[File:Barber pitfall trap.jpg|thumb|A Barber pitfall trap]]

A '''pitfall trap''' is a [[trapping pit]] for small animals, such as insects, amphibians and reptiles. Pitfall traps are mainly used for ecology studies and ecologic pest control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animalethics.org.au/policies-and-guidelines/wildlife-research/pitfall-traps Pitfall traps description]&lt;/ref&gt; Animals that enter a pitfall trap are unable to escape. This is a form of passive collection, as opposed to active collection where the collector catches each animal (by hand or with a device such as a [[butterfly net]]). Active collection may be difficult or time consuming, especially in habitats where it is hard to see the animals such as thick grass.

==Structure and composition==
Pitfall traps come in a variety of sizes and designs. They come in 2 main forms: dry and wet pitfall traps. Dry pitfall traps consist of a container (tin, jar or drum) buried in the ground with its rim at surface level used to [[Animal trapping|trap]] mobile [[animal]]s that fall into it. Wet pitfall traps are basically the same, but contain a solution designed to kill and preserve the trapped animals. The fluids that can be used in these traps include formalin (10% formaldehyde), methylated spirits, alcohol, [[ethylene glycol]], trisodium phosphate, picric acid or even (with daily checked traps) plain water. A little detergent is usually added to break the [[surface tension]] of the liquid to promote quick drowning.
The opening is usually covered by a sloped stone or lid or some other object. This is done to reduce the amount of rain and debris entering the trap, and to prevent animals in dry traps from drowning (when it rains) or overheating (during the day) as well as to keep out predators.

One or more fence-lines of some sort may be added to channel targets into the trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = M.V. | year = 2013 | title = Impacts of pit size, drift fence material and fence configuration on capture rates of small reptiles and mammals in the New South Wales rangelands | url = | journal = Australian Zoologist | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 404–412 | doi = 10.7882/AZ.2013.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traps may also be baited. Lures or baits of varying specificity can be used to increase the capture rate of a certain target species or group by placing them in, above or near the trap. Examples of baits include [[meat]], [[Feces|dung]], [[fruit]] and [[pheromone]]s.

==Uses==
Pitfall traps can be used for various purposes:
*During the mating seasons of toads, frogs and salamanders in temperate climates, these animals often have to cross busy roads on their way from wintering grounds to breeding ponds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chilliwack.com/main/page.cfm?id=1818&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent them from being killed, volunteers may place low fences along roads which the animals have to cross. On short distances, dry pitfall traps are then placed along the fences to collect the animals, which subsequently are manually transferred to the other side of the road, thus preventing massive roadkill.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
*Collectors and researchers of various ground-dwelling [[arthropod]] species may use pitfall traps to collect the animals they are interested in. This can be done without bait (for example [[ground beetles]] and [[spiders]]) or with bait (for example [[dung beetles]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}
*When used in series, these traps may also be used to estimate [[species richness]] (number of species present) and abundances (number of individuals), and this combined information may be used to calculate biodiversity indices (e.g. the [[Shannon index]]).

==Problems==
There are inevitably biases in pitfall sampling when it comes to comparison of different groups of animals and different [[habitat]]s in which the trapping occurs. An animal's trappability depends on the structure of its habitat (e.g. density of vegetation, type of substrate). Gullan and Cranston (2005) recommend measuring and controlling for such variations. Intrinsic properties of the animal itself also affect its trappability: some taxa are more active than others (e.g. higher physiological activity or ranging over a wider area), more likely to avoid the trap, less likely to be found on the ground (e.g. tree-dwelling species that occasionally move across the terrain), or too large to be trapped (or large enough to escape if trapped). Trappability can also be affected by conditions such as temperature or rain, which may alter the animal's behaviour. The capture rate is therefore proportional not only to how abundant a given type of animal is (which is often the factor of interest), but how easily they are trapped. Comparisons between different groups must therefore take into account variation in habitat structure and complexity, changes in ecological conditions over time and the innate differences in species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = M.

[[File:Cryptococcus neoformans using a light India ink staining preparation PHIL 3771 lores.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'' stained with light [[India ink]]]]
'''Radiotrophic fungi''' are [[fungi]] which appear to perform [[radiosynthesis (metabolism)|radiosynthesis]], that is, to use the pigment [[melanin]] to convert [[Gamma rays|gamma radiation]]{{r|sciencenews_20070526}} into chemical energy for growth.{{r|Dadachova}} This proposed mechanism may be similar to [[metabolism|anabolic]] pathways for the [[biosynthesis|synthesis]] of reduced organic carbon (e.g., [[carbohydrates]]) in [[phototroph]]ic organisms, which capture [[photons]] from visible light with pigments such as [[chlorophyll]] whose energy is then used in [[photolysis]] of water to generate usable chemical energy (as [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]) in [[photophosphorylation]] or [[photosynthesis]]. However, whether melanin-containing fungi employ a similar multi-step pathway as photosynthesis, or some [[chemosynthesis]] pathways, is unknown.

==Observations==

===Discovery===
Radiotrophic fungi were discovered in 1991 growing inside and around the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]].{{r|sciencenews_20070526}} Research at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] showed that three melanin-containing fungi—''[[Cladosporium sphaerospermum]]'', ''[[Wangiella dermatitidis]]'', and ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]''—increased in [[biomass]] and accumulated [[acetate]] faster in an environment in which the [[radiation]] level was 500 times higher than in the normal environment. Exposure of ''C. neoformans'' [[cell (biology)|cell]]s to these radiation levels rapidly (within 20–40 minutes of exposure) altered the chemical properties of its melanin, and increased melanin-mediated rates of electron transfer (measured as reduction of [[ferricyanide]] by [[NADH]]) three- to four-fold compared with unexposed cells.&lt;ref name="Dadachova" /&gt; Similar effects on melanin electron-transport capability were observed by the authors after exposure to [[non-ionizing]] radiation, suggesting that melanotic fungi might also be able to use light or heat radiation for growth.

===Comparisons with non-melanized fungi===
However, melanization may come at some metabolic cost to the fungal cells: in the absence of radiation, some non-melanized fungi (that had been mutated in the melanin pathway) grew faster than their melanized counterparts. Limited uptake of nutrients due to the melanin molecules in the fungal [[cell wall]] or toxic intermediates formed in melanin biosynthesis have been suggested to contribute to this phenomenon.{{r|Dadachova}} It is consistent with the observation that despite being capable of producing melanin, many fungi do not synthesize melanin constitutively (i.e., all the time), but often only in response to external stimuli or at different stages of their development.{{r|Calvo}} The exact biochemical processes in the suggested melanin-based synthesis of organic compounds or other [[metabolite]]s for fungal growth, including the chemical intermediates (such as native electron donor and acceptor molecules) in the fungal cell and the location and chemical products of this process, are unknown.

In [[electronics]] and [[electrical engineering]], a '''ramp generator''' is a circuit that creates a linear rising or falling output with respect to time. The output variable is usually voltage, although current ramps can be created.
Linear ramp generators are also known as sweep generators

Ramp generator produces a Sawtooth wave form, Suppose a 3V is applied to input of a comparator of X terminal and ramp generator at Y terminal. the ramp generator starts increasing its voltage but, still lower than input X terminal of the comparator the output shall be 1, As soon as the ramp voltage is equal to or more than X, comparator output goes low.
   
==Applications==
Voltage and current linear ramp generator find wide application in instrumentation and communication systems. 
Ramp generators used in [[electrical generator]]s or [[electric motor]]s to avoid transients when changing a load.&lt;ref name=bm&gt;{{cite book

===Mobile first, unobtrusive JavaScript, and progressive enhancement===

"Mobile first", [[unobtrusive JavaScript]], and [[progressive enhancement]] are related concepts that predate RWD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Responsive Web Design |date=July 23, 2012|url=http://www.webhostdesignpost.com/webdesign/whatisresponsivewebdesign.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Browsers of basic mobile phones do not understand JavaScript or [[media queries]], so a recommended practice is to create a basic web site and enhance it for smart phones and PCs, rather than rely on [[Fault-tolerant system|graceful degradation]] to make a complex, image-heavy site work on mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wroblewski|first=Luke|title=Mobile First|date=November 3, 2009 |url=http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Firtman"&gt;{{cite book|last= Firtman |first=Maximiliano |pages=512|url=http://www.mobilexweb.com/book|title=Programming the Mobile Web|date=July 30, 2011|isbn=978-0-596-80778-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graceful degradation versus progressive enhancement|date=February 3, 2009|url=http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/tutorials/graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113064723/https://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/tutorials/graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement|archivedate=November 13, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=February 2010 |pages=456 |url= http://filamentgroup.com/dwpe/ |title= Designing with Progressive Enhancement |accessdate= March 1, 2010 |isbn= 978-0-321-65888-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Progressive enhancement based on browser, device, or feature detection===

Due to the high volume of usage of internet on mobile devices they can no longer be ignored. In 2014, for the first time more users accessed the internet from their mobile devices than desktop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://allthewayupmedia.com/mobile-website/|title=Mobile Websites {{!}} All The Way Up Media|date=2016-10-31|work=All The Way Up Media|access-date=2017-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where a web site must support basic mobile devices that lack JavaScript, [[User agent#User agent identification|browser ("user agent") detection]] (also called "[[browser sniffing]]") and mobile device detection&lt;ref name="Firtman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SSDD"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|publisher = Smashing magazine |title=Server-Side Device Detection: History, Benefits And How-To|date=September 24, 2012 |url=http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2012/09/24/server-side-device-detection-history-benefits-how-to/}}&lt;/ref&gt; are two ways of deducing if certain HTML and CSS features are supported (as a basis for progressive enhancement)—however, these methods are not completely reliable unless used in conjunction with a device capabilities database.

For more capable mobile phones and PCs, [[Comparison of JavaScript frameworks|JavaScript frameworks]] like [[Modernizr]], [[jQuery]], and [[jQuery Mobile]] that can directly test browser support for HTML/CSS features (or identify the device or user agent) are popular. [[Polyfill (programming)|Polyfill]]s can be used to add support for features—e.g. to support media queries (required for RWD), and enhance HTML5 support, on Internet Explorer. [[Feature detection (web development)|Feature detection]] also might not be completely reliable; some may report that a feature is available, when it is either missing or so poorly implemented that it is effectively nonfunctional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sencha.com/blog/blackberry-torch-the-html5-developer-scorecard |title=BlackBerry Torch: The HTML5 Developer Scorecard &amp;#124; Blog |publisher=Sencha |date=August 18, 2010 |accessdate=September 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305165051/http://www.sencha.com/blog/blackberry-torch-the-html5-developer-scorecard |archive-date=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sencha.com/blog/motorola-xoom-the-html5-developer-scorecard/ |title=Motorola Xoom: The HTML5 Developer Scorecard &amp;#124; Blog |publisher=Sencha |date=February 24, 2011 |accessdate=September 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213051238/http://www.sencha.com/blog/motorola-xoom-the-html5-developer-scorecard/ |archive-date=2015-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges, and other approaches==
Luke Wroblewski has summarized some of the RWD and mobile design challenges, and created a catalog of multi-device layout patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wroblewski|first=Luke|title=Mobilism: jQuery Mobile|date=May 17, 2011|url=http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1330}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RWD&gt;{{cite web |last=Wroblewski |first=Luke |title=Rolling Up Our Responsive Sleeves|date=February 6, 2012|url=http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1494}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wroblewski|first=Luke|title=Multi-Device Layout Patterns|date=March 14, 2012 |url=http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1514}}&lt;/ref&gt; He&amp;nbsp;suggests that, compared with a simple RWD approach, device experience or RESS (responsive web design with server-side components) approaches can provide a user experience that is better optimized for mobile devices.&lt;ref name=RESS&gt;{{cite web |last=Wroblewski |first=Luke |title=Responsive Design ... or RESS|date=February 29, 2012|url=http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1509}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wroblewski|first=Luke|title=RESS: Responsive Design + Server Side Components |date=September 12, 2011 |url=http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Andersen |first=Anders |title=Getting Started with RESS|date=May 9, 2012|url=http://www.netmagazine.com/tutorials/getting-started-ress}}&lt;/ref&gt; Server-side "[[dynamic CSS]]" implementation of stylesheet languages like [[Sass (stylesheet language)|Sass]] or Incentivated's MML can be part of such an approach by accessing a server based API which handles the device (typically mobile handset) differences in conjunction with a device capabilities database in order to improve usability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.incentivated.com/blogdetail/Responsive-but-not-completely-mobile-optimised/ |title=Responsive but not completely mobile optimised &amp;#124; Blog |publisher=Incentivated}}&lt;/ref&gt;  RESS is more expensive to develop, requiring more than just client-side logic, and so tends to be reserved for organizations with larger budgets. Google recommends responsive design for smartphone websites over other approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developers.google.com/webmasters/smartphone-sites/ |title=Building Smartphone-Optimized Websites |publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many publishers are starting to implement responsive designs, one ongoing challenge for RWD is that some [[Web banner|banner advertisements]] and videos are not fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Snyder|first1=Matthew|last2=Koren|first2=Etai|title=The state of responsive advertising: the publishers' perspective|date=April 30, 2012|publisher=.net Magazine|url=http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/state-responsive-advertising-publishers-perspective-4126330}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[search advertising]] and (banner) [[display advertising]] support specific device platform targeting and different advertisement size formats for desktop, smartphone, and basic mobile devices. Different [[landing page]] [[URL]]s can be used for different platforms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/adwords/certification/bin/static.py?hl=en&amp;page=guide.cs&amp;guide=23292|title=Google Partners Help|work=google.com|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] can be used to display different advertisement variants on a page.&lt;ref name="SSDD" /&gt;&lt;ref name=RWD /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://developers.google.com/webmasters/smartphone-sites/javascript JavaScript and Responsive Web Design] Google Developers&lt;/ref&gt; CSS tables permit hybrid fixed+fluid layouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-role-of-table-layouts-in-responsive-web-design--webdesign-10294|title=The Role of Table Layouts in Responsive Web Design|work=Web Design Tuts+|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are now many ways of validating and testing RWD designs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=James|title=Top responsive web design problems... testing|date=August 13, 2012|publisher=.net Magazine |url=http://www.netmagazine.com/features/top-responsive-web-design-problems-and-how-avoid-them#8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from mobile site validators and mobile emulators &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best mobile emulators and RWD testing tools|date=March 20, 2018|publisher=Best Mobile Emulators|url=https://www.downgraf.com/web-development/best-mobile-emulators-and-rwd-testing-tools//}}&lt;/ref&gt; to simultaneous testing tools like Adobe Edge Inspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rinaldi|first=Brian|title=Browser testing... with Adobe Edge Inspect |date=September 26, 2012 |url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/edge-inspect/articles/browser-testing-across-devices-with-adobe-edge-inspect.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers and the Chrome console offer responsive design viewport resizing tools, as do third parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_View|title=Responsive Design View|work=Mozilla Developer Network|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lab.maltewassermann.com/viewport-resizer/|title=Responsive design testing tool – Viewport Resizer – Emulate various screen resolutions - Best developer device testing toolbar|author=Malte Wassermann|work=maltewassermann.com|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use cases of RWD will now expand further with increased mobile usage; according to Statista, organic search engine visits in the US coming from mobile devices has hit 51% and are increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mobile share of organic search engine visits in the United States from 3rd quarter 2013 to 4th quarter 2016|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/297137/mobile-share-of-us-organic-search-engine-visits/|accessdate=27 March 2017|agency=Statista}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mobile sketch template.pdf|thumb|300px|Template for mobile and desktop app design.]]

==History==
The first site to feature a layout that adapts to browser viewport width was ''[[Audi]].com'' launched in late 2001,&lt;ref&gt;Kalbach, Jim (July 22, 2012). [https://experiencinginformation.wordpress.com/2012/07/22/the-first-responsive-design-website-audi-circa-2002/ "The First Responsive Design Website: Audi (circa 2002)."] {{sps|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  created by a team at [[razorfish (company)|razorfish]] consisting of Jürgen Spangl and Jim Kalbach (information architecture), Ken Olling (design), and Jan Hoffmann (interface development). Limited browser capabilities meant that for Internet Explorer, the layout could adapt dynamically in the browser whereas for Netscape, the page had to be reloaded from the server when resized.

Cameron Adams created a demonstration in 2004 that is still online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Adams|first1=Cameron|title=Resolution dependent layout: Varying layout according to browser width|url=http://www.themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2004/09/21/|website=The Man in Blue|date=September 21, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2008, a number of related terms such as "flexible", "liquid",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G146.html|title=G146: Using liquid layout|work=w3.org|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "fluid", and "elastic" were being used to describe layouts. CSS3 media queries were almost ready for prime time in late 2008/early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/CR-css3-mediaqueries-20090423/|title=Media Queries|work=w3.org|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethan Marcotte coined the term responsive web design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outseller.net/2015s-professional-responsive-web-design-offer-businesses/|title=OutSeller Group - Organize, Optimize, Maximize|work=outseller.net|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (RWD)&amp;mdash;and defined it to mean fluid grid/ flexible images/ media queries&amp;mdash;in a May 2010 article in ''[[A List Apart]]''.&lt;ref name=fluid_grid /&gt;&lt;!--ref name=EM /--&gt; He described the theory and practice of responsive web design in his brief 2011 book titled ''Responsive Web Design''. Responsive design was listed as #2 in Top Web Design Trends for 2012 by [[.net (magazine)|.net magazine]] after [[progressive enhancement]] at #1.

[[Mashable]] called 2013 the Year of Responsive Web Design.&lt;ref name="mashable_2013"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cashmore|first=Pete|title=Why 2013 Is the Year of Responsive Web Design|date=December 11, 2012|url=http://mashable.com/2012/12/11/responsive-web-design/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other sources have recommended responsive design as a cost-effective alternative to mobile applications due to its ability to house all of the code in a single website. Users and developers alike began realizing the benefits and importance of mobile-responsive designs as mobile use continued to rise. &lt;ref name="wesfed_2016"&gt;{{cite web|last=Foster|first=Wes|title=Why mobile websites are important|date=December 6, 2016|url=https://www.wesfed.com/blog/why-mobile-websites-are-important/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This realization of importance was confirmed when Google made their announcement that search engines were going to reward responsive websites with increased rankings.

'''Sexual orientation change efforts''' ('''SOCE''') are methods used in attempts to change the [[sexual orientation]] of [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] and [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] people to [[heterosexuality]].&lt;ref name="apa2009"&gt;[[American Psychological Association]]: [http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/sexual-orientation.aspx Resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts]&lt;/ref&gt;  They may include behavioral techniques, cognitive behavioral techniques, psychoanalytic techniques, medical approaches, religious and spiritual approaches,&lt;ref name=apaTaskForce&gt;{{cite web|title = Report of the American Psychological Association Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation|url = http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf|accessdate = July 28, 2015|date = September 28, 2009|first1 = Judith M.|last1 = Glassgold|first2 = Lee|last2 = Beckstead|first3 = Jack|last3 = Drescher|authorlink3 = Jack Drescher|first4 = Beverly|last4 = Greene|first5 = Robin Lin|last5 = Miller|first6 = Roger L.|last6 = Worthington|first7 = Clinton W.|last7 = Anderson|publisher = [[American Psychological Association]]|deadurl = no|archive-date = June 15, 2010|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100615023708/http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in some parts of the world, acts of sexual violence ("[[corrective rape]]"). According to the American Psychiatric Association Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation, "there are no studies of adequate scientific rigor to conclude whether or not such methods work to change sexual orientation.

There is a large body of research evidence that indicates that being gay, lesbian or bisexual is compatible with normal mental health and social adjustment.&lt;ref name="rcp2007" /&gt; Because of this, the major mental health professional organizations do not encourage individuals to try to change their sexual orientation. Indeed, such interventions are ethically suspect because they can be harmful to the psychological well-being of those who attempt them; clinical observations and self-reports indicate that many individuals who unsuccessfully attempt to change their sexual orientation experience considerable psychological distress. For these reasons, no major mental health professional organization has sanctioned efforts to change sexual orientation and virtually all of them have adopted policy statements cautioning the profession and the public about treatments that purport to change sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Herek"&gt;[http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/gill-v-office-of-personnel-management/2009-11-17-doma-aff-herek.pdf Expert affidavit of Gregory M.

SOCE have been controversial due to tensions between the values held by some right-wing faith-based organizations, on the one hand, and those held by [[LGBT rights]] organizations, human rights and civil rights organizations, and other faith-based organizations, as well as professional and scientific organizations, on the other. Some individuals and groups have, contrary to global scientific research and consensus, promoted the idea of homosexuality as symptomatic of developmental defects or spiritual and moral failings and have argued that SOCE, including psychotherapy and religious efforts, could alter homosexual feelings and behaviors.&lt;ref name="apa2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=PAHO /&gt; Such efforts are potentially harmful because they present the view that the sexual orientation of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth is a mental illness or disorder, and they often frame the inability to change one's sexual orientation as a personal and moral failure.&lt;ref name=facts&gt;American Psychological Association: [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/just-the-facts.pdf Just the Facts about Sexual Orientation &amp; Youth: A Primer for Principals, Educators, &amp; School Personnel]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these individuals and groups appeared to be embedded within the larger context of conservative religious political movements that have supported the stigmatization of homosexuality on political or religious grounds.&lt;ref name="apa2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=PAHO /&gt;

===Richard von Krafft-Ebing===
{{undue weight|section|date=March 2017}}
[[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] was a German-Austrian psychiatrist and one of the founders of scientific sexology. His first systematic work on sexual pathology was published in 1877 in a German psychiatric journal. His influential work, ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]'' was published in 1886. Numerous expanded German editions followed, and it was widely translated. Krafft-Ebing became a proponent of the sickness model of homosexuality.&lt;ref name=Rosario&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosario|1997|pp=67–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section IV of ''Psychopathia Sexualis'', “General Pathology“, discussed homosexuality in “Diagnosis, Prognosis and Therapy of Antipathic Sexual Instinct.” Krafft-Ebing believed that homosexuality could be either innate or acquired. In his view, it could sometimes be treated through prevention of [[masturbation]] and cure of the neuroses “arising out of the unhygienic conditions of sexual life”,&lt;ref name=Krafft-EbingP299&gt;{{Harvnb|Krafft-Ebing|1965|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these methods would work only in rare cases “where acquired antipathic sexual instinct has not progressed far”,&lt;ref name=Krafft-EbingP299 /&gt; and would therefore usually be ineffective even when homosexuality was not inborn. Krafft-Ebing believed that hypnosis was therefore the "only means of salvation"&lt;ref name=Krafft-EbingP300&gt;{{Harvnb|Krafft-Ebing|1965|p=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; in most cases. He stated that he knew of only a single case in which self-hypnosis had proven successful, and that hypnotic suggestion by another person was usually necessary to change homosexuality.

Krafft-Ebing wrote about this method that "...&amp;nbsp;the object of post-hypnotic suggestion is to remove the impulse to masturbation and homosexual feelings, and to encourage heterosexual emotions with a sense of virility".&lt;ref name=Krafft-EbingP299 /&gt; Krafft-Ebing described three cases in which he believed it had proved satisfactory, writing that they "seem to afford a proof that even the gravest cases of congenital sexual inversion may be benefited by the application of hypnotism".&lt;ref name=Krafft-EbingP308&gt;{{Harvnb|Krafft-Ebing|1965|p=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; He warned however that "only when hypnotism produces deep somnambulism decided and lasting results may be hoped for".&lt;ref name=Krafft-EbingP306&gt;{{Harvnb|Krafft-Ebing|1965|p=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He rejected castration as a cure for homosexuality, and the internment of gay people in asylums, except in cases involving sex crimes. Krafft-Ebing cautioned that the success or failure of treatments for homosexuality proved nothing about its causes. He defended the right of patients to receive such treatment. Krafft-Ebing criticised several objections to medical treatment of homosexuality, including the charges that it was ineffective and that it gave an opportunity "to tainted individuals to propagate their perversions".&lt;ref name=Krafft-EbingP306 /&gt; In his view, physicians had a duty to provide such treatment if it was requested.

He concluded his discussion of methods of curing homosexuality by remarking that “in the majority of cases, the patient is quite satisfied when he becomes sexually neutral, and under these circumstances medical skill has rendered a great service to both society and the individual himself.”&lt;ref name=Krafft-EbingP307&gt;{{Harvnb|Krafft-Ebing|1965|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later editions of ''Psychopathia Sexualis'' included an increased number of autobiographies by gay people who made it clear that they did not wish to change their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Rosario" /&gt;

===Current status===
In the last two decades of the 19th century, a different view began to predominate in [[Medicine|medical]] and [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] circles, judging such behavior as indicative of a type of person with a defined and relatively stable [[sexual orientation]]. In the late 19th and 20th centuries, pathological models of homosexuality were standard.

In 1992, the [[World Health Organization]] replaced its categorization of homosexuality as a mental illness with the diagnosis of ego-dystonic homosexuality. The [[UK Government]] followed suit in 1994, followed by the Ministry of Health in [[Russian Federation]] in 1999 and the [[Chinese Society of Psychiatry]] in 2001.

The trustees of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) had previously voted unanimously (13 to 0, with two abstentions) to remove homosexuality as a disorder from the ''Sexual Deviancy'' section of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], the DSM-II in 1973. This decision was officially confirmed by 58% of the general APA membership in 1974, who voted to replace the diagnosis with a milder category of "sexual orientation disturbance". At that time APA stressed that removing homosexuality from the list of psychiatric disorders does not mean it is "normal" or as valuable as heterosexuality. They also stated that modern methods of treatment allow interested homosexuals to change their sexual orientation with a significant degree of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://displus.sk/DSM/subory/dsm2_revision.pdf|title=Homosexuality and Sexual Orientation Disturbance: Proposed Change in DSM-II, 6th Printing, page44 POSITION STATEMENT|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=APA Document ReferenceNo.730008|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 the DSM-III replaced "sexual orientation disturbance" with "ego-dystonic homosexuality" which, in 1986, was deleted from the DSM-III-R. The APA now classifies persistent and marked distress about one's sexual orientation under ''Sexual Disorders Not Otherwise Specified''.

No major mental health professional organization has sanctioned efforts to change sexual orientation and virtually all of them have adopted policy statements cautioning the profession and the public about treatments that purport to change sexual orientation. These include the American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, American Counseling Association, National Association of Social Workers in the US, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Australian Psychological Society, and the [[Pan American Health Organization]].

==Reasons why people seek to change sexual orientation==
[[Christian right]] political groups have marketed sexual orientation change [[Direct-to-consumer advertising|directly to consumers]]. In 1998, these groups, including the [[Family Research Council]] and the [[American Family Association]] spent $600,000 on advertising promoting [[conversion therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/how-christians-turned-against-gay-conversion-therapy/390570/|title=How Christians Turned Against Gay Conversion Therapy|author=Jonathan Merritt|date=15 Apr 2015|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/ex-ex-gay-pride-249282|title=Ex-Ex-Gay Pride|work=Newsweek|date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of people who attempt to change their sexual orientation come from conservative religious backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolosi, Byrd, &amp; Potts, 2000; Schaeffer, Hyde, Kroencke, McCormick, &amp; Nottebaum, 2000; Schaeffer, Nottebaum, Dech, &amp; Drawczyk, 2000; Spitzer, 2001a).&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Spitzer found that 79% of 200 men and women who said they changed their sexual orientation were motivated by religion, with 93% indicating that religion is "extremely" or "very" important.&lt;ref name=spitzer&gt;Spitzer, 2001a&lt;/ref&gt;  Others indicated their desire came from moral or social values, which may be independent of their religion.&lt;ref name=rosik&gt;{{cite journal

The article states that adolescents are increasingly comfortable in revealing their same-sex attraction to their parents because of the "generational shift in views of sexual orientation" due in part to increasing acceptance of [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]] and same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name="pmid25397646"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Zachariah P |author2=Blaschke GS |author3=Weddle M | title=A request for "conversion therapy". | journal=Virtual Mentor | year= 2014 | volume= 16 | issue= 11 | pages= 877–83 | pmid=25397646 | doi=10.1001/virtualmentor.2014.16.11.ecas2-1411 | pmc= | url=http://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/2014/11/ecas2-1411.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/162689/record-high-say-gay-lesbian-relations-morally.aspx|title=In U.S., Record-High Say Gay, Lesbian Relations Morally OK|publisher=Gallup|date=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An APA task force found that people often sought out SOCE due to (a) a lack of other sources of social support; (b) a desire for active coping and (c) access to methods of [[sexual orientation identity]] exploration and reconstruction.&lt;ref name="apaTaskForce  "/&gt;  The [[American Psychological Association]] states that harassment and abuse, as well as pressure from family, peers, and religious groups ignorant about and prejudiced against homosexuality, may cause high levels of emotional stress for LGB people. These pressures may lead people to feel forced into attempting to change their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=apa1997&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.apa.org/pi/sexual.html |title=Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation |accessdate=2007-08-28 |date=1997-08-14 |publisher=American Psychological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have found that [[social pressure]] plays a key role in a person's desire to change his or her sexuality.&lt;ref name="shildo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beckstead, A.

==Methods==

===Behavior therapy===
{{See also|Aversion therapy}}
Types of behavior therapy used to change sexual orientation include [[aversion therapy]], covert sensitization and systematic desensitization.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cA1alCqUOUAC&amp;pg=PA134|title=A Short Textbook of Psychiatry|author=Niraj Ahuja|date=30 July 2006|publisher=Jaypee Brothers Publishers|edition=illustrated|isbn=9788180618710}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aversion therapy]] associates negative stimuli with homoerotic pictures and positive stimuli with heteroerotic pictures. A series of 1966 experiments appeared promising, and the practice became popular, but when reports were shown to be flawed, it fell out of favour.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1994, the [[American Psychological Association]] has declared that aversion therapy is a dangerous practice that does not work, but it is still in use in some countries.&lt;ref name=India&gt;{{cite web

{{Main|Conversion therapy}}
The [[American Psychological Association]] defines conversion therapy or reparative therapy as therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="answers"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.apa.org/topics/sorientation.pdf |title=Answers to Your Questions: For a Better Understanding of Sexual Orientation and Homosexuality |accessdate=2008-02-14 |date=February 2008 |publisher=American Psychological Association |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Psychiatric Association states that conversion therapy or reparative therapy is a type of psychiatric treatment "based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that a patient should change his/her sexual [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] orientation."&lt;ref name="Psych"&gt;{{Cite book

The ethics guidelines of major U.S. mental health organizations vary from cautionary statements about the safety, effectiveness, and dangers of prejudice associated with conversion therapy ([[American Psychological Association]]) to recommending that ethical practitioners refrain from using conversion therapy ([[American Psychiatric Association]]) or referring patients to others who do ([[American Counseling Association]]).

{{Main|Ex-gay movement}}
A task force commissioned by the APA found that ex-gay groups act like support groups, in that they help counteract and buffer [[Minority Stress]], marginalization, and isolation.&lt;ref name=apaTaskForce /&gt;

Most ex-gay groups focus on abstaining from homosexual relationships rather than a complete sexual orientation change from homosexual to heterosexual.&lt;ref name=PATH&gt;[http://www.pathinfo.org/index2.htm PATH] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408181244/http://www.pathinfo.org/index2.htm |date=2013-04-08 }}: Positive Alternatives To Homosexuality&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Lucy Bannerman|title=The camp that 'cures' homosexuality|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4893735.ece|accessdate=28 July 2015|work=The Times Online|date=7 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106235050/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4893735.ece|archivedate=6 January 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Five Goals|url=http://couragerc.net/TheFiveGoals.html|website=couragerc.net|accessdate=28 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214021814/http://couragerc.net/TheFiveGoals.html|archivedate=14 December 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.evergreeninternational.org/five-truths-same-sex-attraction.html |title= Five Truths About Same-sex Attraction |work= EvergreenInternational.org |publisher= [[Evergreen International]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120729034253/http://www.evergreeninternational.org/five-truths-same-sex-attraction.html |archivedate= 2012-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evergreen International]] taught that it is unlikely therapy can erase all homosexual feelings,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.evergreeninternational.org/therapy.htm |title= Therapy |first= Jason |last= Park |year= 2007 |work= EvergreenInternational.org |publisher= [[Evergreen International]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120724193910/http://www.evergreeninternational.org/therapy.htm |archivedate= 2012-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and does not advocate any particular form of therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.evergreeninternational.org/Myths.htm |title= Myths |work= EvergreenInternational.org |publisher= [[Evergreen International]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120724193920/http://www.evergreeninternational.org/Myths.htm |archivedate= 2012-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage therapy===
{{See also|Relationship counseling}}
People with a [[sexual relationship disorder]] have difficulty forming or maintaining a relationship because of their sexual orientation. A significant number of men and women experience conflict surrounding homosexual expression within a [[mixed-orientation marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolf TJ |title=Group psychotherapy for bisexual men and their wives |journal=J.

===Religious methods===
{{See also|Religion and homosexuality}}
Some people with unwanted homosexual attractions turn to their faith for help. Some conservative Christians believe that homosexuality is a result of a broken world and that faith can change sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Lauren Gregory|title=Faith said to change sexual orientation|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2008/dec/28/faith-said-change-sexual-orientation/?local|accessdate=28 July 2015|work=Chattanooga Times Free Press|date=28 December 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709070024/http://timesfreepress.com/news/2008/dec/28/faith-said-change-sexual-orientation/?local|archivedate=9 July 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some report that their sexual orientation has been changed through the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] of [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070710/skepticism-over-validity-of-ex-gay-story-prompts-confessions/index.html|title=Skepticism Over Validity of Ex-Gay Story Prompts 'Confessions'|author=Lillian Kwon|date=10 July 2007|work=Christian Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syntonic therapy===
Syntonic therapy, a method developed by Robert Kronemeyer, was based partly on the work of [[Wilhelm Reich]].

Kronemeyer rejected some earlier methods that were used in attempts to change homosexuality, including [[Conversion therapy#Lobotomy|lobotomy]], electroshock treatment, and [[Aesthetic Realism]].&lt;ref name="Kronemeyer 1980 p. 87"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kronemeyer | first=Robert | title=Overcoming homosexuality | publisher=Macmillan | year=1980 | isbn=978-0-02-566850-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IuEpAQAAMAAJ | p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nazi experiments==
{{See also|Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|Nazi human experimentation}}

During [[the Holocaust]], an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 gay men were imprisoned in concentration camps on the grounds that male homosexuality was deemed incompatible with [[Nazism]]. Some imprisoned homosexuals faced human experimentation by Nazi doctors who sought to find a "medical cure" for homosexuality. No scientific knowledge has been yielded from these experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005261 |title=Persecution of Homosexuals in the Third Reich |publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|USHMM]] |access-date= August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]], Nazi doctor [[Carl Værnet]] conducted hormonal experiments on twelve gay men. He made incisions in their [[groin]] and implanted a metal tube that released testosterone over a prolonged period, as he believed that a lack of testosterone was the cause of homosexuality. Although some of the men claimed to have become heterosexual, the results are largely unreliable as many are assumed to have stated they were "cured" in order to be released from the camp. Those who did not show improvement were determined to be "chronic" or "incurable" homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tamagne |first= Florence |date=2004 |title=A History of Homosexuality in Europe Vol. II: Berlin, London, Paris, 1919-1939 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0875863574 |publisher=Algora Publishing |page=290 |isbn=978-0875863573}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/homo.html|title=Homosexuals &amp; the Holocaust: Background &amp; Overview|last1= Austin |first1=Ben |last2= |first2= |website=Jewish Virtual Library |access-date= August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of SOCE==
{{over-quotation|section|date=March 2017}}
The American Psychological Association appointed the Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation to review the available research. Ex-gay organizations expressed concerns about the lack of representation of pro-reparative-therapy perspectives on the task force, while alleging that anti-reparative-therapy perspectives were amply represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/jul/11/gay-reparative-therapy-under-scrutiny/ |title=Gay reparative therapy under scrutiny |publisher=Washington Times|location=New York |date=July 11, 2007 |accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The task force reached the following findings:&lt;ref name="apa2009"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Recent studies of participants in Sexual Orientation Change Efforts (SOCE) identify a population of individuals who experience serious distress related to same sex sexual attractions. Most of these participants are Caucasian males who report that their religion is extremely important to them (Beckstead &amp; Morrow, 2004; Nicolosi, Byrd, &amp; Potts, 2000; Schaeffer, Hyde, Kroencke, McCormick, &amp; Nottebaum, 2000; Shidlo &amp; Schroeder, 2002, Spitzer, 2003). These individuals report having pursued a variety of religious and secular efforts intended to help them to change their sexual orientation. To date, the research has not fully addressed age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, disability, language, and socioeconomic status in the population of distressed individuals.

There are no studies of adequate scientific rigor to conclude whether or not recent SOCE do or do not work to change a person’s sexual orientation. Scientifically rigorous older work in this area (e.g., Birk, Huddleston, Miller, &amp; Cohler, 1971; James, 1978; McConaghy, 1969, 1976; McConaghy, Proctor, &amp; Barr, 1972; Tanner, 1974, 1975) found that sexual orientation (i.e., erotic attractions and sexual arousal oriented to one sex or the other, or both) was unlikely to change due to efforts designed for this purpose. Some individuals appeared to learn how to ignore or limit their attractions. However, this was much less likely to be true for people whose sexual attractions were initially limited to people of the same sex.

Although sound data on the safety of SOCE are extremely limited, some individuals reported being harmed by SOCE. Distress and depression were exacerbated. Belief in the hope of sexual orientation change followed by the failure of the treatment was identified as a significant cause of distress and negative self-image (Beckstead &amp; Morrow, 2004; Shidlo &amp; Schroeder, 2002).

Although there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation, some individuals modified their sexual orientation identity (i.e., group membership and affiliation), behavior, and values (Nicolosi, Byrd, &amp; Potts, 2000). They did so in a variety of ways and with varied and unpredictable outcomes, some of which were temporary (Beckstead &amp; Morrow, 2004; Shidlo &amp; Schroeder, 2002). Based on the available data, additional claims about the meaning of those outcomes are scientifically unsupported.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Position of professional organizations on SOCE==
{{over-quotation|section|date=March 2017}}
The [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD-10]], which is widely used internationally outside of North America (where DSM-IV-TR is used), states that "sexual orientation by itself is not to be regarded as a disorder".&lt;ref name="icd" /&gt;  It lists [[ego-dystonic sexual orientation]] as a disorder instead, the diagnosis for which is when "the gender identity or sexual preference (heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or prepubertal) is not in doubt, but the individual wishes it were different because of associated psychological and behavioural disorders, and may seek treatment in order to change it."&lt;ref name="icd"&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate = 2007-08-28

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Working Group preparing the [[ICD-11]] (due for publication in 2018) has reported, in relation to this and other sexual orientation-related disorders classified in section F66, that there is "no evidence that [these classifications] are clinically useful" and recommended that section F66 be deleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Proposed declassification of disease categories related to sexual orientation in the ''International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems'' (ICD-11)|first1 = Susan D.|last1 = Cochran|first2 = Jack|last2 = Drescher|authorlink2 = Jack Drescher|first3 = Eszter|last3 = Kismödi|first4 = Alain|last4 = Giami|first5 = Claudia|last5 = García-Moreno|first6 = Elham|last6 = Atalla|first7 = Adele|last7 = Marais|first8 = Elisabeth|last8 = Meloni Vieira|first9 = Geoffrey M.|last9 = Reed|journal = [[Bulletin of the World Health Organization]]|year = 2014|volume = 92|issue = 9|pages = 672–679|doi = 10.2471/BLT.14.135541|pmid = 25378758|pmc = 4208576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[Pan American Health Organization]] (the North and South American branch of the [[World Health Organization]]) released a statement cautioning against "services that purport to 'cure' people with non-heterosexual sexual orientations" as they "lack medical justification and represent a serious threat to the health and well-being of affected people", and noted that "there is a professional consensus that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation of human sexuality and cannot be regarded as a pathological condition". The organization further called "on governments, academic institutions, professional associations and the media to expose these practices and to promote respect for diversity." They further noted that adolescents have sometimes been forced to attend these therapies involuntarily, being deprived of their liberty and sometimes kept in isolation for several months, and that these findings were reported by several [[United Nations]] bodies. Additionally, the organization recommended that such malpractices be denounced and subject to sanctions and penalties under national legislation, as they constitute a violation of the ethical principles of health care and violate [[human rights]] that are protected by international and regional agreements.&lt;ref name=PAHO /&gt;

The American Psychiatric Association "affirms that same-sex sexual and romantic attractions, feelings, and behaviors are normal and positive variations of human sexuality regardless of sexual orientation identity; reaffirms its position that homosexuality per se is not a mental disorder and opposes portrayals of sexual minority youths and adults as mentally ill due to their sexual orientation; concludes that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation; encourages mental health professionals to avoid misrepresenting the efficacy of sexual orientation change efforts by promoting or promising change in sexual orientation when providing assistance to individuals distressed by their own or others’ sexual orientation; concludes that the benefits reported by participants in sexual orientation change efforts can be gained through approaches that do not attempt to change sexual orientation; concludes that the emerging knowledge on affirmative multiculturally competent treatment provides a foundation for an appropriate evidence-based practice with children, adolescents and adults who are distressed by or seek to change their sexual orientation; advises parents, guardians, young people, and their families to avoid sexual orientation change efforts that portray homosexuality as a mental illness or developmental disorder and to seek psychotherapy, social support and educational services that provide accurate information on sexual orientation and sexuality, increase family and school support, and reduce rejection of sexual minority youth; encourages practitioners to consider the ethical concerns outlined in the 1997 APA Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Response to Sexual Orientation, in particular the following standards and principles: scientific bases for professional judgments, benefit and harm, justice, and respect for people's rights and dignity; encourages practitioners to be aware that age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, disability, language, and socioeconomic status may interact with sexual stigma, and contribute to variations in sexual orientation identity development, expression, and experience; opposes the distortion and selective use of scientific data about homosexuality by individuals and organizations seeking to influence public policy and public opinion and will take a leadership role in responding to such distortions; supports the dissemination of accurate scientific and professional information about sexual orientation in order to counteract bias that is based in lack of knowledge about sexual orientation; and encourages advocacy groups, elected officials, mental health professionals, policy makers, religious professionals and organizations, and other organizations to seek areas of collaboration that may promote the wellbeing of sexual minorities."&lt;ref name="apa2009" /&gt;&lt;!--pretty long-winded sentence. Any good way to break it up?--&gt;

The American Psychiatric Association also states: "It is possible to evaluate the theories which rationalize the conduct of "reparative" and conversion therapies.  Firstly, they are at odds with the scientific position of the American Psychiatric Association which has maintained, since 1973, that homosexuality per se, is not a mental disorder.  The theories of "reparative" therapists define homosexuality as either a developmental arrest, a severe form of psychopathology, or some combination of both.  In recent years, noted practitioners of "reparative" therapy have openly integrated older psychoanalytic theories that pathologize homosexuality with traditional religious beliefs condemning homosexuality. The earliest scientific criticisms of the early theories and religious beliefs informing "reparative" or conversion therapies came primarily from sexology researchers.  Later, criticisms emerged from psychoanalytic sources as well.  There has also been an increasing body of religious thought arguing against traditional, biblical interpretations that condemn homosexuality and which underlie religious types of "reparative" therapy."&lt;ref name=apa2001&gt;American Psychiatric Association: [http://www.dayagainsthomophobia.org/IMG/pdf/2000COPPStatement.pdf Therapies Focused on Attempts to Change Sexual Orientation (Reparative or Conversion Therapies) - Position statement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512012332/http://www.dayagainsthomophobia.org/IMG/pdf/2000COPPStatement.pdf |date=2013-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the Royal College of Psychiatrists states: "The Royal College shares the concern of both the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association that positions espoused by bodies like the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH) in the United States are not supported by science. There is no sound scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be changed. Furthermore so-called treatments of homosexuality as recommended by NARTH create a setting in which prejudice and discrimination can flourish. The Royal College of Psychiatrists holds the view that lesbian, gay and bisexual people should be regarded as valued members of society who have exactly similar rights and responsibilities as all other citizens."&lt;ref name="royal2009"/&gt;

In [[Australia]], the Australian Psychological Society states: "Even though homosexual orientation is not a mental illness and there is no scientific reason to attempt conversion of lesbians or gays to heterosexual orientation, some individuals may want to change their own sexual orientation or that of another individual (for example, parents seeking therapy for their child). Some therapists who undertake this kind of therapy report that they have changed their client's sexual orientation (from homosexual to heterosexual) in treatment. Close scrutiny of these reports shows that many of the claims come from organisations with an ideological perspective on sexual orientation rather than from mental health researchers. Also, the treatments and their outcomes are poorly documented and the length of time that clients are followed up after the treatment is sometimes too short to be a true reflection of the outcome. In other cases it has been shown that individuals can be assisted to live a heterosexual lifestyle, but that their sexual orientation remains unchanged. In other words, their pattern of arousal to members of the same sex does not alter. The Australian Psychological Society acknowledges the lack of scientific evidence for the usefulness of conversion therapy, and notes that it can in fact be harmful for the individual."&lt;ref name="aps"/&gt;  The [[Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists]]' position statement on SOCE notes that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is prohibited by the College's code of ethics and states that "lesbian, gay, and bisexual people are equally valued members of society who have exactly similar rights and responsibilities as all other citizens."  The College's official position is that it "does not support the use of sexual orientation change efforts of any kind" and mandates that "[m]ental health workers must avoid misrepresenting the efficacy of sexual orientation change efforts when providing assistance to people distressed by their own or others’ sexual orientation."&lt;ref name = RANZCP&gt;{{cite web|title = Position Statement 60 &amp;ndash; Sexual Orientation Change Efforts|publisher = [[Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists]]|date = June 2015|url = https://www.ranzcp.org/Files/Resources/College_Statements/Position_Statements/PS-60-PS-Sexual-Orientation-Change-Efforts-(Ju-(1).aspx|accessdate = January 16, 2018|archive-date = September 26, 2015|deadurl = no|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150926222933/https://www.ranzcp.org/Files/Resources/College_Statements/Position_Statements/PS-60-PS-Sexual-Orientation-Change-Efforts-(Ju-(1).aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[China]], Western psychiatry and psychology were imported during a "Westernization Movement" in the late 19th century. At that time, the West viewed homosexuality as a mental disorder, and that became the prevailing view in China as well. During this period, homosexual sexual behavior was grounds for persecution, a marked change from the attitude of general (but not total) acceptance found in pre-19th-century China. These views lasted throughout the 1970s, despite changed theoretical models of sexuality orientation in the West, during a period when the Chinese government held a "closed-door" policy on information about human sexuality. After 1980, information became more available, and views began to change. In 2000 and under pressure from both the APAs and the ACA, the [[Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders]] (CCMD-III) declassified homosexuality, but added a diagnosis resembling [[ego-dystonic sexual orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In [[Italy]], little research has been conducted in the mental health community on homosexuality. Early work tended to describe homosexuality as a pathology or a developmental arrest.

In [[Germany]], the psychiatry, psychology, and sexology establishment from the early 20th century viewed homosexuality as pathological. However, following the increased visibility of the homosexual community during the [[AIDS epidemic]] of the late 1980s and the declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder in the ICD-10, non-pathological, rather than pathological, models of homosexuality became mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In [[Norway]], a country known for its strong LGBT rights legislation, the shift from a pathological to non-pathological understanding of homosexuality began in the 1970s, following the APA's declassification in 1973. In 2000, the General Assembly of the Norwegian Psychiatric Association overwhelmingly voted for the following position statement on sexual orientation change therapy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Homosexuality is no disorder or illness, and can therefore not be subject to treatment. A ‘treatment’ with the only aim of changing sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual must be regarded as ethical malpractice, and has no place in the health system.&lt;ref name=norway&gt;{{cite journal

==Debate==
Changing sexuality has become highly politicized, and the ensuing debates "have obscured the scientific data by calling into question the motives and even the character of individuals on both sides of the issue."&lt;ref name="Psych" /&gt;  The ethics, efficacy, benefits, and potential for harm of SOCE are under extensive debate, both in the professional literature and the popular media.&lt;ref name=apa1997 /&gt;  Concerns have been expressed about forcing people to undergo SOCE against their will, blocking people who are seeking to change their sexual orientation from attempting to do so, and concern over the way SOCE is being promoted affects LGB rights.

The [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] says psychoanalytic SOCE often causes psychological pain by reinforcing [[internalized homophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/therapeutic-response.pdf|title=Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation|last=Glassgold|first=Judith|author2=Lee Beckstead |author3=Jack Drescher |author4=Beverly Greene |author5=Robin Lin Miller |author6=Roger L. Worthington |author7=Clinton W. Anderson |year=2009|accessdate=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists has stated that the harm that SOCE "therapies can cause to individuals, the contribution they make to the misrepresentation of homosexuality as a mental disorder, and the prejudice and discrimination that can flourish through the use of such therapies has led all major medical organisations to oppose the use of sexual orientation change efforts".&lt;ref name = RANZCP /&gt;

===Forced SOCE===
Until the 1970s, homosexuality was considered a mental illness and homosexuals were forced by the government to undergo treatment.&lt;ref name="ucdavis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_mental_health.html|title=Homosexuality and Mental Health|date=|work=ucdavis.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2015}} Famous cases include [[Alan Turing]]. This practice is outlawed in most of the world, but human right groups have complained that in some parts of the world, treatment is still being forced upon unwilling patients.&lt;ref name="India"/&gt;

In one of the few published U.S. cases dealing with conversion therapy, the Ninth Circuit addressed the topic in the context of an asylum application. A Russian citizen "had been apprehended by the Russian militia, registered at a clinic as a 'suspected lesbian,' and forced to undergo treatment for lesbianism, such as 'sedative drugs' and hypnosis." The Ninth Circuit held that the conversion treatments to which Pitcherskaia had been subjected constituted mental and physical torture. The court rejected the argument that the treatments to which Pitcherskaia had been subjected did not constitute persecution because they had been intended to help her, not harm her, stating that "human rights laws cannot be sidestepped by simply couching actions that torture mentally or physically in benevolent terms such as 'curing' or 'treating' the victims."&lt;ref name="Gans"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gans |first=Laura A. |title=Inverts, Perverts, and Converts: Sexual Orientation Conversion Therapy and Liability |date=Winter 1999 |journal=The Boston University Public Interest Law Journal |volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been few, if any, [[medical malpractice]] lawsuits filed on the basis of conversion therapy. Laura A. Gans suggested in an article published in ''The Boston University Public Interest Law Journal'' that this is due to an "historic reluctance of consumers of mental health services to sue their care givers" and "the difficulty associated with establishing the elements of... causation and harm... given the intangible nature of psychological matters." Gans also suggested that a [[tort]] cause of action for [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]] might be sustainable against therapists who use conversion therapy on patients who specifically say that his or her anxiety does not arise from his or her sexuality.

Another concern is unwilling patients, particularly children, being forced into SOCE. Children experience significant pressure to conform with sexual norms, particularly from their peers, and often lack adequate legal protection from coercive treatment.&lt;ref name=apa1997 /&gt;

In 2005, [[Love In Action]], an ex-gay ministry based in Memphis, was investigated by the Tennessee Department of Health and the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities for providing counseling and mental health care without a license, and for treating adolescents without their consent. There have been reports that teenagers have been forcibly treated with conversion therapy on other occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.qrd.org/qrd/religion/anti/exgay/exgay.ministries.txt |title=About Ex-Gay Ministries |author=David Williams |accessdate=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Melzer |first=Eartha |title=Tenn. opens new probe of 'ex-gay' facility: Experts say children should not be forced into counseling |url=http://www.washblade.com/2005/7-1/news/national/tenopen.cfm |publisher=Washington Blade |date=2005-07-01 |accessdate=2007-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ben_20060210"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Popper |first=Ben |title=Love in Court: Gay-to-straight ministry and the state go to court |url=http://memphisflyer.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A12034 |publisher=[[Memphis Flyer]] |date=2006-02-10 |accessdate=2007-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several legal researchers argue that parents who force their children into aggressive conversion therapy programs are committing [[child abuse]] under various state statutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Talbot |first=T. |title=Reparative therapy for homosexual teens: the choice of the teen should be the only choice discussed |journal=Journal of Juvenile Law |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohan |first=J. |title=Parental Duties and the Right of Homosexual Minors to Refuse "Reparative" Therapy |journal=Women's Law Journal |year=2002 |issue=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard A. Cohen]], an advocate of conversion therapy, has said, "If someone wants to live a gay life, that needs to be respected.

===Voluntary SOCE===
[[Gregory M. Herek]], a professor of psychology at the University of California, Davis, wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Few would dispute that some people’s sexual orientation changes during their lifetime. Indeed, many lesbians and gay men report living as a heterosexual before recognizing or developing their homosexual orientation. The question at issue is not whether sexual orientation can change but whether interventions can be designed to bring about such change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stolaf.edu/people/huff/classes/Psych130F2010/LabDocuments/SpitzerComme|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805152015/http://www.stolaf.edu/people/huff/classes/Psych130F2010/LabDocuments/SpitzerComme|deadurl=yes|title=St. Olaf College|date=5 August 2012|archivedate=5 August 2012|publisher=|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Positive Alternatives to Homosexuality]], a coalition of ex-gay groups,&lt;ref name=MarketWire&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_20050229/ai_mark337292201/|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708193024/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_20050229/ai_mark337292201/|deadurl=yes|title=Diverse Coalition Forms to Support People Seeking 'Non-Gay' Alternati…|date=8 July 2012|archivedate=8 July 2012|publisher=|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; supports the right for individuals to pursue a non-homosexual identity if they so choose, the right to know information the coalition provides to make informed decisions, and the right of those conflicted by their homosexual attraction to self-determine their own goals in therapy. They advocate compassion and respect specifically for ex-homosexuals and those on that path, and policy neutrality in creating laws that would inhibit freedom of speech to discuss SOCE. They claim equal access to public forums to state their viewpoint, share their experiences, and to raise awareness of ways to reject a gay identity.&lt;ref name=PATH /&gt;

===Promotion of SOCE===
The American Psychological Association and the Royal College of Psychiatrists expressed concerns that the positions espoused by NARTH and Focus on the Family are not supported by the science and create an environment in which prejudice and discrimination can flourish.&lt;ref name="royal2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apaexgay"/&gt; The Just the Facts Coalition, consisting of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], [[American Association of School Administrators]], [[American Counseling Association]], [[American Federation of Teachers]], [[American Psychological Association]], American School Counselor Association, [[American School Health Association]], Interfaith Alliance Foundation, [[National Association of School Psychologists]], [[National Association of Secondary School Principals]], [[National Association of Social Workers]], [[National Education Association]], and the School Social Work Association of America, in 2008 released ''Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation and Youth''. In it, they expressed concern that the advancement of SOCE may cause social harm by disseminating inaccurate views about sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=JustTheFacts&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/justthefacts.html |title=Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation &amp; Youth: A Primer for Principals, Educators and School Personnel |accessdate=2007-08-28 |year=1999 |publisher=Just the Facts Coalition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force has described the recent support for sexual orientation change efforts as "the Christian Right repackag[ing] its anti-gay campaign in kinder, gentler terms. Instead of simply denouncing homosexuals as morally and socially corrupt, the Christian Right has now shifted to a strategy of emphasizing ... the ex-gay movement. Behind this mask of compassion, however, the goal remains the same: to roll back legal protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people ..."&lt;ref name="challenge"&gt;{{cite web

Psychologist John Gonsiorek said the way in which the Christian right promoted SOCE was hypocritical.

Conversion therapy became an issue during the [[Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey|2017 postal survey]] that led to the [[Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017|legalisation]] of [[same-sex marriage in Australia]].

In May 2015, [[Manitoba]] became the first province within Canada to outlaw conversion therapy on LGBT minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2015/05/22/manitoba-bans-conversion-therapy|title=Manitoba bans conversion therapy|first1=David|last1=Larkins|first2=Postmedia|last2=Network|website=Toronto Sun|accessdate=13 July 2017|date=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ontario]] was the second province within Canada to outlaw conversion therapy on LGBT minors. The Affirming Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Act, 2015 was given [[royal assent]], on 4 June 2015, with immediate [[coming into force|force]], banning the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/conversion-therapy-for-lgbtq-youth-to-be-banned-in-ontario-1.3101640|title=

===Ecuador===
In November 2011, an Ecuadorean activist group, called Fundación Causana, began a petition on [[Change.org]] to entreat the Ecuadorean minister of health to close down more than 200 illegal "ex-gay clinics". The group claimed that the clinics abuse and torture patients in an effort to "cure homosexuality". The clinics primarily targeted [[lesbian]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Lesbian Torture Clinics in Ecuador- Claiming to "Cure" Them | work=Hispanically Speaking News | publisher=[[Hispanically Speaking News]] | url=http://www.hispanicallyspeakingnews.com/notitas-de-noticias/details/lesbian-torture-clinics-in-ecuador-claiming-to-cure-them/11469/ | date=5 November 2011 | accessdate=17 January 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212001139/http://www.hispanicallyspeakingnews.com/notitas-de-noticias/details/lesbian-torture-clinics-in-ecuador-claiming-to-cure-them/11469/ | archivedate=12 December 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and operated under the guise of being drug rehabilitation centers.&lt;ref name="Huffington"&gt;{{cite web | title=Why 200 Lesbian Torture Clinics Are Still Operating in Ecuador | work=The Huffington Post | publisher=[[The Huffington Post]] | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/emilia-gutierrez/ecuador-lesbian-torture-clinics_b_1087533.html | date =11 November 2011 | accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one pair of parents discovered the abuse and asked for the clinic to release their daughter, Paola Ziritti, but were denied. Ziritti was eventually released after two years of confinement and was the first to press a formal complaint against the clinics.&lt;ref name="Huffington"/&gt;

Activists consequently called on the government to close down the clinics, but as of August 2011, only 27 had been closed while a reported 207 clinics remained open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Lesbians Escape From Ecuador's "Ex-Gay" Torture Centers | work=The Advocate | publisher=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] | url=http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2011/10/07/Lesbians_Escape_From_Ecuadors_ExGay_Torture_Centers | date=7 October 2011 | accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 January 2012, the Change.org petition was closed and marked as a success with 113,761 international signatures. The petition also was updated with a statement from Fundacion Causana reading,
&lt;blockquote&gt;After ten years of outcry, the nation of Ecuador - through the Ministry of Public Health - has entered into a commitment with civic organizations and society in general to deconstruct the belief that homosexuality is an illness and root out the use of torture in these clinics. We extend our thanks to all the men and women who signed our petition. It has been invaluable to have this support in starting to change this reality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Carina Vance Mafla]]'s ministry of health shortly thereafter raided three clinics in the vicinity of Quito and rescued dozens of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | publisher=MSNBC | date=25 January 2012 | url=http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/01/25/10237126-rights-groups-hail-ecuadors-crackdown-on-lesbian-torture-clinics | title=Rights groups hail Ecuador's crackdown on lesbian 'torture clinics' | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610071713/http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/01/25/10237126-rights-groups-hail-ecuadors-crackdown-on-lesbian-torture-clinics | archivedate=10 June 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Evolutionary biology}}
The '''social effects of evolutionary thought''' have been considerable.  As the scientific explanation of life's diversity has developed, it has often displaced alternative, sometimes very widely held, explanations. Because the theory of [[evolution]] includes an explanation of humanity's origins, it has had a profound impact on human [[society|societies]]. Some have vigorously denied acceptance of the scientific explanation due to its perceived religious implications (e.g. its implied rejection of the [[special creation]] of humans presumably described in the [[Bible]]). This has led to a vigorous conflict between [[creation and evolution in public education]], primarily in the United States.

==Evolution and ethics==
The theory of evolution by natural selection has also been adopted as a foundation for various ethical and social systems, such as [[social Darwinism]], an idea that preceded the publication of &lt;cite&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/cite&gt;, popular in the 19th century, which holds that "the [[survival of the fittest]]" (a phrase coined in 1851 by Herbert Spencer, 6 years before Darwin published his theory of evolution) explains and justifies differences in wealth and success among societies and people. A similar interpretation was one created by Darwin's cousin, [[Francis Galton]], known as [[eugenics]], which claimed that human civilization was subverting natural selection by allowing the less bright and less healthy to survive and out-breed the more smart and more healthy.

Later advocates of this theory suggested radical and often coercive social measures in an attempt to "correct" this imbalance. [[Thomas Huxley]] spent much time demonstrating through a series of thought experiments that it would not only be immoral, but impossible,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2940 Evolution and Ethics by Thomas Henry Huxley]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and others have argued that social Darwinism is based on misconceptions of evolutionary theory, and many ethicists regard it as a case of the [[is-ought problem]]. After the atrocities of [[the Holocaust]] became linked with eugenics, it greatly fell out of favor with public and scientific opinion, though it was never universally accepted by either, and at no point in Nazi literature is Charles Darwin or the scientific theory of evolution mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rationalrevolution.net/articles/darwin_nazism.htm The fallacious nature of [[reductio ad Hitlerum]] arguments by anti-evolutionists.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=January 2015}}

In his book ''[[The End of Faith]]'', [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] argues that Nazism was largely a continuation of [[Christian anti-Semitism]]. Jim Walker compiled a list of 129 quotes from [[Mein Kampf]] in which Hitler described himself as a Christian, or mentioned God, Jesus or a biblical passage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobeliefs.com/hitler.htm Webpage containing 129 Mein Kampf quotes relating to his Christianity]&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{who|date=January 2015}} argue that six million of the people killed during the Holocaust were killed because of their religion (Judaism) not their race, "strength," or any reason with an obvious link to the mechanism of Darwinian evolution. Hitler often used Christian beliefs like, "Jews killed Jesus," to justify his anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobeliefs.com/hitlerchristian.htm Religion and Hitler - a history]&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion that humans share ancestors with other animals has also affected how some people view the relationship between humans and other species. Many proponents of [[animal rights]] hold that if animals and humans are of the same nature, then rights cannot be distinct to humans.

Charles Darwin, in fact, &lt;!-- himself was an abolitionist who --&gt; considered "[[sympathy]]" to be one of the most important [[Ethics|moral virtues]] — and that it was, indeed, a product of natural selection and a trait beneficial to social animals (including [[homo sapiens|humans]]). Darwin further argued that the most "sympathetic" societies would consequently be the most "successful." He also stated that our sympathy should be extended to "all sentient beings":

{{quote|As man advances in civilization, and small tribes are united into larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the members of the same nation, though personally unknown to him. This point being once reached, there is only an artificial barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races. If, indeed, such men are separated from him by great differences in appearance or habits, experience unfortunately shows us how long it is, before we look at them as our fellow-creatures. ... This virtue, one of the noblest with which man is endowed, seems to arise incidentally from our sympathies becoming more tender and more widely diffused, until they are extended to all sentient beings. As soon as this virtue is honored and practiced by some few men, it spreads through instruction and example to the young, and eventually becomes incorporated in public opinion.|source=Charles Darwin; ''The Descent of Man'', 1871}}

===Thomas Huxley: Evolution and Ethics===
{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=May 2009}}
{{Essay-like|date=September 2013}}
[[Thomas Huxley]], ''Darwin's Bulldog'', spent much of his book [[Evolution and Ethics]] debunking Social Darwinism, piece by piece. The following is a summary of his arguments in the ''Prolegomena'', the most detailed and comprehensive of the two sections devoted to it. It should be noted that Huxley is here attempting to disprove the science behind Social Darwinism; as such, the moral arguments only come in later in the essay.

Consider a garden. Without constant upkeep, it would return to the ''state of nature'', even the very walls surrounding it crumbling in sufficient time, but by constant diligence of the gardener, may be maintained in a ''state of art''. This "state of art" is not permanent: It is instead the replacement of natural selection by artificial selection through the human energy expended in maintaining it.

This artificial selection is, however, part of natural selection: It is the action upon a set of species by the human species by way of the human species expending energy through evolved intelligence on its choice of selection. It is thus no less natural than, for example, a predator expending energy through evolved instinct on preferentially hunting a certain prey species. The presence of humans may change the dynamic, but in a perfectly natural way. Hence, it is part of the ''cosmic process'', that is natural laws, even though the "histological process" may remove many aspects of the "struggle for existence" that is a key part of the natural laws that apply to biology, from its preferred plant species by substituting human work for work done by the species itself.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Not only is the state of nature hostile to the state of art of the garden; but the principle of the horticultural process, by which the latter is created and maintained, is antithetic to that of the cosmic process. The characteristic feature of the latter is the intense and unceasing competition of the struggle for existence. The characteristic of the former is the elimination of that struggle, by the removal of the conditions which give rise to it. The tendency of the cosmic process is to bring about the adjustment of the forms of plant life to the current conditions; the tendency of the horticultural process is the adjustment of the conditions to the needs of the forms of plant life which the gardener desires to raise.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nature uses unrestricted breeding to let hundreds compete for the natural resources that would only support one, and uses frost and drought to kill off the weak and unlucky, requiring not just strength, but "flexibility and good fortune." However, a gardener restricts multiplication, gives each plant sufficient space and nourishment,  protects from frost and drought&amp;mdash;and, in every other way, attempts to modify the conditions to benefit the forms that most nearly approach the result he desires. However, though the gardener's actions may have circumvented natural selection, he can still improve the species, should he find them wanting, through selective breeding. The struggle for existence is not actually required for improvement: only heritability, variation, and some form of selective pressure.

Can we then apply this to humans? Let's see how far we can take the analogy with respect to colonization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Suppose a shipload of English colonists sent to form a settlement, in such a country as Tasmania was in the middle of the last century. On landing, they find themselves in the midst of a state of nature, widely different from that left behind them in everything but the most general physical conditions. The common plants, the common birds and quadrupeds, are as totally distinct as the men from anything to be seen on the side of the globe from which they come. The colonists proceed to put an end to this state of things over as large an area as they desire to occupy.  They clear away the native vegetation, extirpate or drive out the animal population, so far as may be necessary, and take measures to defend themselves from the re-immigration of either. In their place, they introduce English grain and fruit trees; English dogs, sheep, cattle, horses; and English men; in fact, they set up a new Flora and Fauna and a new variety of mankind, within the old state of nature. Their farms and pastures represent a garden on a great scale, and themselves the gardeners who have to keep it up, in watchful antagonism to the old regime. Considered as a whole, the colony is a composite unit introduced into the old state of nature; and, thenceforward, a competitor in the struggle for existence, to conquer or be vanquished.

Under the conditions supposed, there is no doubt of the result, if the work of the colonists be carried out energetically and with intelligent combination of all their forces. On the other hand, if they are slothful, stupid, and careless; or if they waste their energies in contests with one another, the chances are that the old state of nature will have the best of it. The native savage will destroy the immigrant civilized man; of the English animals and plants some will be extirpated by their indigenous rivals, others will pass into the feral state and themselves become components of the state of nature. In a few decades, all other traces of the settlement will have vanished.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, as yet we lack an organized gardener. Let us imagine an idealized one: an administrative authority of intelligence and foresight as much greater than men as men are to their livestock. The unwanted native species - men, animals, or plants - are all weeded out and destroyed. Those to replace them are chosen with a view to his ideal of the colony, just as a gardener tries to create through his selection his ideal garden. And, finally, to ensure that no struggle for existence between the colonists interferes with the struggle against nature, he provides them with sufficient food, housing, and so on. "With every step of this progress in civilization, the colonists would become more and more independent of the state of nature; more and more, their lives would be conditioned by a state of art. In order to attain his ends, the administrator would have to avail himself of the courage, industry, and co-operative intelligence of the settlers; and it is plain that the interest of the community would be best served by increasing the proportion of persons who possess such qualities, and diminishing that of persons devoid of them. In other words, by selection directed towards an ideal."

However, though this might create a paradise where every aspect of nature works to support its colonists, problems arise: "as soon as the colonists began to multiply, the administrator would have to face the tendency to the reintroduction of the cosmic struggle into his artificial fabric, in consequence of the competition, not merely for the commodities, but for the means of existence. When the colony reached the limit of possible expansion, the surplus population must be disposed of somehow; or the fierce struggle for existence must recommence and destroy that peace, which is the fundamental condition of the maintenance of the state of art against the state of nature.

If the administrator is guided purely by scientific considerations, he would work to restrict the population by removing "the hopelessly diseased, the infirm aged, the weak or deformed in body or in mind, and the excess of infants born," just as a "gardener pulls up defective and superfluous plants, or the breeder
destroys undesirable cattle. Only the strong and the healthy, carefully matched, with a view to the progeny best adapted to the purposes of the administrator, would be permitted to perpetuate their kind."

And so we have reached Social Darwinism. However, we do not have an idealized administrator:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the more thoroughgoing of the multitudinous attempts to apply the principles of cosmic evolution, or what are supposed to be such, to social and political problems, which have appeared of late years, a considerable proportion appear to me to be based upon the notion that human society is competent to furnish, from its own resources, an administrator of the kind I have imagined. The pigeons, in short, are to be their own [[Sir John Sebright]]. A despotic government, whether individual or collective, is to be endowed with the preternatural intelligence, and with what, I am afraid, many will consider the preternatural ruthlessness, required for the purpose of carrying out the principle of improvement by selection, with the somewhat drastic thoroughness upon which the success of the method depends.  Experience certainly does not justify us in limiting the ruthlessness of individual "saviors of society"; and, on the well-known grounds of the aphorism which denies both body and soul to corporations, it seems probable (indeed the belief is not without support in history) that a collective despotism, a mob got to believe in its own divine right by demagogic missionaries, would be capable of more thorough work in this direction than any single tyrant, puffed up with the same illusion, has ever achieved.  But intelligence is another affair. The fact that "saviors of society" take to that trade is evidence enough that they have none to spare. And such as they possess is generally sold to the capitalists of physical force on whose resources they depend. However, I doubt whether even the keenest judge of character, if he had before him a hundred boys and girls under fourteen, could pick out, with the least chance of success, those who should be kept, as certain to be serviceable members of the polity, and those who should be chloroformed, as equally sure to be stupid, idle, or vicious. The "points" of a good or of a bad citizen are really far harder to discern than those of a puppy or a short-horn calf; many do not show themselves before the practical difficulties of life stimulate manhood to full exertion. And by that time the mischief is done. The evil stock, if it be one, has had time to multiply, and selection is nullified.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, humans are not cattle, nor flowers: the organization of human society is kept together by
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...bonds of such a singular character, that the attempt to perfect society after his fashion would run serious risk of loosening them. They do not even correspond to social insects such as bees: With bees, "The members of the society are each organically predestined to the performance of one particular class of functions only. If they were endowed with desires, each could desire to perform none but those offices for which its organization specially fits it; and which, in view of the good of the whole, it is proper it should do. Among mankind, on the contrary, there is no such predestination to a sharply defined place in the social organism. However much men may differ in the quality of their intellects, the intensity of their passions, and the delicacy of their sensations, it cannot be said that one is fitted by his organization to be an agricultural laborer and nothing else, and another to be a landowner and nothing else. Moreover, with all their enormous differences in natural endowment, men agree in one thing, and that is their innate desire to enjoy the pleasures and to escape the pains of life; and, in short, to do nothing but that which it pleases them to do, without the least reference to the welfare of the society into which they are born, checked only by sympathy, familial and social bonds, and fear of the judgment of ones fellow man. "Every forward step of social progress brings men into closer relations with their fellows, and increases the importance of the pleasures and pains derived from sympathy.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In short, he describes a creation of morality.

Since morality is what keeps the desire for selfishness in check, it is necessary to the propagation of society, with one requirement: the punishment of wrongdoers being necessary for the continuation of society, self-restraint must not be taken so far that wrongdoers may act unrestrained: Without the protection of society against them, "The followers of the "golden rule" may indulge in hopes of heaven, but they must reckon with the certainty that other people will be masters of the earth."&lt;ref&gt;Huxley credits Hartley (Observations on Man (1749), vol. ii p. 281.) for not only having "...laid the foundations but built up much of the superstructure of a true theory of the Evolution of the intellectual and moral faculties and for having realized that the creation of civilization will in itself create ethics, if not in an evolutionary context." as well as [[Adam Smith]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley sums up this section of his argument against Social Darwinism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have further shown cause for the belief that direct selection, after the fashion of the horticulturist and the breeder, neither has played, nor can play, any important part in the evolution of society; apart from other reasons, because I do not see how such selection could be practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of the bonds which hold society together. It strikes me that men who are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak, the unfortunate, and the superfluous; who justify that conduct on the ground that it has the sanction of the cosmic process, and is the only way of ensuring the progress of the race; who, if they are consistent, must rank medicine among the black arts and count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit; on whose matrimonial undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence; whose whole lives, therefore, are an education in the noble art of suppressing natural affection and sympathy, are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left. But, without them, there is no conscience, nor any restraint on the conduct of men, except the calculation of self-interest, the balancing of certain present gratifications against doubtful future pains; and experience tells us how much that is worth. Every day, we see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which, as they believe when cool, they risk eternal punishment; while they hold back from those which are opposed to the sympathies of their associates.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Huxley finishes with a series of short, further evidences against Social Darwinism, including:

* Historical evidences against: Consider the vast changes of society between the Tudor and the Victorian eras; however, human nature, as evidenced by their writing, remains the same. "In my belief, the innate qualities, physical, intellectual, and moral, of our nation have remained substantially the same for the last four or five centuries. If the struggle for existence has affected us to any serious extent (and I doubt it) it has been, indirectly, through our military and industrial wars with other nations."
* Whether some qualities are virtues or vices depends on circumstance: "The benevolence and open-handed generosity which adorn a rich man, may make a pauper of a poor one; the energy and courage to which the successful soldier owes his rise, the cool and daring subtlety to which the great financier owes his fortune, may very easily, under unfavorable conditions, lead their possessors to the gallows, or to the hulks. Moreover, it is fairly probable that the children of a "failure" will receive from their other parent just that little modification of character which makes all the difference. I sometimes wonder whether people, who talk so freely about extirpating the unfit, ever dispassionately consider their own history. Surely, one must be very "fit," indeed, not to know of an occasion, or perhaps two, in one's life, when it would have been only too easy to qualify for a place among the "unfit.""

==Evolution and religion==
{{See also|History of evolutionary thought}}

Before Darwin's argument and presentation of the evidence for evolution, Western [[religion]]s generally discounted or condemned any claims that diversity of life is the result of an evolutionary process, as did most scientists in the English scientific establishment. However, evolution was accepted by some religious groups such as the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church and the liberal [[Anglican]] theologians who went on to publish ''[[Essays and Reviews]]''. as well as by many scientists in [[France]] and [[Scotland]] and some in [[England]], notably [[Robert Edmund Grant]]. Literal or authoritative interpretations of [[sacred text|Scripture]] hold that a [[God|supreme being]] directly created humans and other animals as separate ''[[Created kind]]s'', which to some means species. This view is commonly referred to as [[creationism]]. From the 1920s to the present in the US, there has been a strong religious backlash to the teaching of evolution theory, particularly by conservative [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]]. They have expressed concerns about the effects of the teaching of evolution on society and their faith (see [[Creation-evolution controversy]]).

In response to the wide scientific acceptance of the theory of evolution, many religions have formally or informally synthesized the scientific and religious viewpoints. Several important 20th century scientists ([[Ronald Fisher|Fisher]], [[Theodosius Dobzhansky|Dobzhansky]]) whose work confirmed Darwin's theory, were also [[Christianity|Christians]] who saw no incompatibility between their experimental and theoretical confirmations of evolution and their faith. Some religions have adopted a [[Evolutionary creationism|theistic evolution]] viewpoint, where God provides a [[divine spark]] that ignited the process of evolution and (or), where God has guided evolution in one way or another.

===Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church===

{{main|Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church}}
The [[Roman Catholic Church]], beginning in 1950 with [[Pope Pius XII]]'s encyclical [[Humani generis|Humani Generis]], took up a neutral position with regard to evolution. "The Church does not forbid that...research and discussions, on the part of men experienced in both fields, take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 22, 1996, address to the [[Pontifical Academy of Science]], [[Pope John Paul II]] updated the Church's position, recognizing that Evolution is "more than a hypothesis" - "In his encyclical Humani Generis, my predecessor Pius XII has already affirmed that there is no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of the faith regarding man and his vocation... Today, more than a half-century after the appearance of that encyclical, some new findings lead us toward the recognition of evolution as more than an hypothesis. In fact it is remarkable that this theory has had progressively greater influence on the spirit of researchers, following a series of discoveries in different scholarly disciplines."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP961022.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic views on Evolution===

Classical figures have not discussed the subject as it has only come up in the 19th century. Contemporaries have come up with several distinct stances. One stance is that adaptation, or evolution on a micro scale, is accepted within a species, but cross-species evolution, that is evolution from one species into another species, is not as the human beginning is considered to be miraculous. However, this traditional thought would not conflict with the view that human-like beings could have been created around the same time as human beings, which, in this view, would explain the fossil records that look human but are not. Another stance is that since evolution is the simplest explanation it is the most reasonable to accept under the condition that it is not random but occurs only with the permission of God every step of the way. One particular argument that supports the idea that evolution is possible is the one stating that in that the stages of human development in evolution are akin to the distinct stages of development acknowledged in the Koran.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The final stance completely rejects cross-species evolution across all organisms, but approves of adaptation (micro evolution).

===Jewish views on evolution===

{{main|Jewish views on evolution}}
{{Empty section|date=August 2018}}

==Evolutionary theory and the political left==
{{Undue weight section|date=September 2011}}

Many important political figures on the left have never publicized their views on [[biology]], and so their opinions of evolutionary theory are unknown. To some extent, [[Marxist]]s are the exception. [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] supported Darwin's evolutionary theory. Marx even sent Darwin a copy of his book ''[[Das Kapital]]'', though Darwin never wrote back to him. Karl Marx's work was based on a material view of the world that showed natural causes and effects for all aspects of human society and economy. He recognized that Darwin's work provided a similar material explanation for all of nature, thus supporting Marx's worldview.

In 1861 Karl Marx wrote to his friend Ferdinand Lassalle, "Darwin’s work is most important and suits my purpose in that it provides a basis in natural science for the historical class struggle. ... Despite all shortcomings, it is here that, for the first time, 'teleology' in natural science is not only dealt a mortal blow but its rational meaning is empirically explained."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Marx &amp; Engels Collected Works|volume=41|pages=246-247|chapter=Letter to F. Lassalle in Berlin. London, 16 January 1861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most later Marxists agreed with this view, but some – particularly those in the early [[Soviet Union]] – believed that evolutionary theory conflicted with their economic and social ideals. As a result, they came to support [[Lamarckism]] instead – the idea that an organism can pass on characteristics that it acquired during its lifetime to its offspring. This led to the practice of [[Lysenkoism]], which caused agricultural problems.

In his book, ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', [[anarcho-communism|anarcho-communist]] [[Peter Kropotkin]] argued that co-operation and mutual aid are as important in the evolution of the species as competition and mutual strife, if not more so.

On the contemporary moderate left, some authors such as [[Peter Singer]] (in his book, ''[[A Darwinian Left]]'') support Darwinism but reach different political and economic lessons than more conservative observers. Richard Dawkins' book, ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', has a chapter, "Nice guys finish first," that attempts to explain the role of altruism and cooperation in evolution and how social animals not only cannot survive without such traits, but how evolution will create them. Dawkins explains that when an animal sacrifices itself or uses its resources for the survival of other members of the same species, its genes, present on the other animals, survive. For example, if a mother dies to save three of its pups, one and a half copies (on average) of its genes will survive, because there is a 50% chance of a particular gene being present in its offspring. Dawkins also made a documentary of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzeCn02l_Rw Nice guys finish first]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the documentary, Dawkins added that chapter as a way of overcoming modern day misinterpretations of the concept of ''survival of the fittest''.

==Evolution in relation to Social Darwinism and Imperialism==

"[[Social Darwinism]]" is a derogatory term associated with the 19th century [[Malthusianism|Malthusian]] theory developed by [[British Whig Party|Whig]] philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]]. It is associated with evolutionary theory but now widely regarded as unwarranted. Social Darwinism was later expanded by others into ideas about "[[survival of the fittest]]" in commerce and human societies as a whole, and led to claims that [[social inequality]], [[sexism]], [[racism]] and [[imperialism]] were justified.&lt;ref&gt;On the history of [[eugenics]] and evolution, see {{cite book|authorlink=Daniel Kevles |first=D |last=Kevles |year=1998 |title=In the Name of Eugenics: Genetics and the Uses of Human Heredity |publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-44557-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these ideas contradict [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s own views, and contemporary scientists and philosophers consider these ideas to be neither mandated by evolutionary theory nor supported by data.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] strongly disagreed with attempts by Herbert Spencer and others to extrapolate evolutionary ideas to all possible subjects; see {{cite book|authorlink=Mary Midgley|first=M|last=Midgley|year=2004|title=The Myths we Live By|publisher=Routledge|page=62|isbn=978-0-415-34077-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Allhoff F |title=Evolutionary ethics from Darwin to Moore |journal=History and philosophy of the life sciences |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=51–79 |year=2003 |pmid=15293515 |doi=10.1080/03919710312331272945 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gowaty, Patricia Adair |title=Feminism and evolutionary biology: boundaries, intersections, and frontiers |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall |location=London |year=1997 |isbn=0-412-07361-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social Darwinism is further linked with [[nationalism]] and imperialism.&lt;ref name="Marvin Perry"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Perry |first1=Marvin |last2=Chase |first2=Myrna |last3=Jacob |first3=Margaret |last4=Jacob |first4=James |last5=Daly |first5=Jonathan W. |last6=Von Laue |first6=Theodore H. |year=2014 |title=Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jy5BBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA634&amp;lpg=PA634 |volume=Volume II: Since 1600 |edition=11th |location=Boston, MA |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |pages=634–635 |isbn=978-1-305-09142-9 |lccn=2014943347 |oclc=898154349 |quote=The most extreme ideological expression of nationalism and imperialism was Social Darwinism.

Social Darwinists vigorously advocated empires, saying that strong nations—by definition, those that were successful at expanding industry and empire—would survive and others would not.

The '''sock''' and '''buskin''' are two ancient symbols of [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]]. In Greek theatre, actors in tragic roles wore a boot called a [[buskin]] (Latin ''cothurnus'') that elevated them above the other actors. The actors with comedic roles only wore a thin soled shoe called a [[Soccus|sock]] (Latin ''soccus'').

[[Melpomene]], the muse of tragedy, is often depicted holding the tragic mask and wearing buskins. [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]], the muse of comedy, is similarly associated with the mask of comedy and comic’s socks. Some people refer to the masks themselves as "Sock and Buskin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Mackay|title=A Glossary of Obscure Words and Phrases in the Writings of Shakspeare and His Contemporaries Traced Etymologically to the Ancient Language of the British People as Spoken Before the Irruption of the Danes and Saxons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wKXTAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA48|year=1887|publisher=S.

The '''Structural Genomics Consortium''' ('''SGC''') is a not-for-profit organization formed in 2004 to determine the three-dimensional structures of [[protein]]s of medical relevance, and place them in the [[Protein Data Bank]] without restriction on use. The SGC operates out of the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Toronto|Toronto]]. Over the past five years, the SGC has accounted for ~25% of the global output of novel human protein structures each year, and ~40% of the annual global output of structures of proteins from human parasites.  The SGC target proteins have relevance to human health and disease, such as [[diabetes]], [[cancer]] and infectious diseases such as [[malaria]].

The SGC is an 'open data' partnership. All research results are published with no restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Perkmann Markus, Schildt Henri | year = 2015 | title = Open Data Partnerships between Firms and Universities: The Role of Boundary Organizations | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733314002248/ | journal = Research Policy | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 1133–1143 | doi=10.1016/j.respol.2014.12.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SGC is also spearheading an "open access" chemistry partnership&amp;nbsp;– a new model for pre-competitive drug discovery in which the public and private sectors collaborate to generate potent and selective pharmacological inhibitors of human proteins that regulate epigenetic signalling, and commit to make these reagents available without restriction on use.

In 2011, the SGC launched a project to create high-quality recombinant antibodies to proteins implicated in epigenetic events in an effort to stimulate research on these proteins. The project is carried out in partnership with leading academic research groups in the field (Tony Kossiakoff and Shohei Koide at University of Chicago, Sachdev Sidhu at the University of Toronto) and the laboratory of Jack Greenblatt at the University of Toronto. These reagents will be made available without restriction on use.

The SGC is headed by [[Aled Edwards]] (CEO/Director). Operations at each site are managed by a Chief Scientist&amp;nbsp;– [[Cheryl Arrowsmith]] in [[Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]] and Chas Bountra in [[Oxford]], [[UK]].

; "Discovery of a Selective, Substrate Competitive Inhibitor of the Lysine Methyltransferase SETD8"
: To date, SETD8 is the only methyltransferase that induces monomethylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20), which is involved with the regulation of biological processes such as DNA damage response.  SETD8 also monomethylates [[proliferating cell nuclear antigen]] (PCNA) and promotes [[carcinogenesis]], but inhibitors are virtually unknown besides nahuoic acid A.  In result of this study, the first substrate-competitive inhibitor was found (UNC0379).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ma|first1=A|title=Discovery of a Selective, Substrate-Competitive Inhibitor of the Lysine Methyltransferase SETD8|journal=J Med Chem|volume=57|issue=15|pages=6822–6833|pmid=25032507|doi=10.1021/jm500871s|date=Aug 2014|pmc=4136711}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; "Copper is required for oncogenic BRAF signalling and tumorigenesis": When the [[BRAF (gene)|BRAF]] kinase is mutated, it induces an active state of cancer (e.g. melanomas, thyroid cancer, etc.).  The study found that when Copper Transporter 1 (CTR1) levels are decreased, the BRAF-related signaling and tumorigenesis levels decrease, also.  Next, when human cells are transformed by BRAF or resistant to its inhibition, copper chelators used to treat [[Wilson's disease]] can help lessen tumor growth.  When combined, the results of this study indicate that copper [[chelation therapy]] could be a very strong candidate for treating cancers related to any BRAF mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brady|first1=DC|title=Copper is required for oncogenic BRAF signalling and tumorigenesis|journal=Nature|volume=509|issue=7501|pages=492–496|pmid=24717435|doi=10.1038/nature13180|date=May 2014|pmc=4138975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; "LRIG2 mutations cause urofacial syndrome": [[Urofacial syndrome]] (UFS) is linked with a major risk of kidney failure and unique facial expression when crying, smiling, or laughing.  Those afflicted with UFS have a mutated LRIG2, which is a protein that is heavily involved with tumorigenesis and neural cell signaling.  Previous studies showed that UFS can also be caused by mutations in encoding [[heparanase]]-2 (HPSE2), and after studying nerve fascicles within muscle bundles in the human fetal bladder, it is confirmed that both are involved in the neural development of the urinary tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stuart|first1=HM|title=LRIG2 mutations cause urofacial syndrome|journal=Am J Hum Genet|date=2013|volume=92|issue=2|pages=259–264|pmid=23313374|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.12.002|pmc=3567269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; "Human-Chromatin-Related Protein Interactions Identify a Demethylase Complex Required for Chromosome Segregation": The study resulted in a comprehensive protein-protein interaction map (chromatin-related) while also identifying 164 chromatin-modifying complexes.  Also, they found that KDM8 and RCCD1 form a histone [[demethylase]] complex, which plays a very big role in the chromosome's stability and division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edyta|first1=Marcon|title=Human-Chromatin-Related Protein Interactions Identify a Demethylase Complex Required for Chromosome Segregation|journal=Cell Reports|date=26 June 2014|volume=8|issue=1|pages=297–310|url=http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/abstract/S2211-1247(14)00444-6?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2211124714004446%3Fshowall%3Dtrue|accessdate=16 November 2014|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2014.05.050|pmid=24981860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results had a great indication of the ISG15 pathway being of great significance.  Though there are likely numerous pathways or targets, the study provided great insight into the subject, nonetheless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ma|first1=Xue-Zhong|title=Protein Interferon-Stimulated Gene 15 Conjugation Delays but Does Not Overcome Coronavirus Proliferation in a Model of Fulminant Hepatitis|journal=Journal of Virology|date=19 March 2014|volume=88|issue=11|pages=6195–6204|url=http://jvi.asm.org/content/88/11/6195|accessdate=17 November 2014|doi=10.1128/jvi.03801-13|pmid=24648452|pmc=4093886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; "Novel Approaches for Targeting Kinases: Allosteric Inhibition, Allosteric Activation and Pseudokinases": Deregulation of protein kinases are very involved with a plethora of different diseases, and the study involved the finding of kinase inhibitors that have good pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties.

; "Structural Basis for Histone Mimicry and Hijacking of Host Proteins by Influenza Virus Protein NS1": Diseases can arise from pathogens that mimic host proteins.  The NS1 protein that is involved with [[influenza A]] that is well known for using mimicry to compete with host proteins.  The study concluded that the mimicry was imperfect in its copying, but it still must have underlying involvement with influenza A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Qin|first1=Su|title=Structural Basis for Histone Mimicry and Hijacking of Host Proteins by Influenza Virus Protein NS1|journal=Nature Communications|date=21 December 2013|volume=5|issue=3952|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140523/ncomms4952/full/ncomms4952.html|accessdate=16 November 2014|doi=10.1038/ncomms4952|pmid=24853335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; "Mutant Prolactin Receptor and Familial Hyperprolactinemia": The study dealt with three sisters with [[hyperprolactinemia]] and how their heredity is involved.  The study concluded that the mutations that causes this disease leads to prolactin insensitivity and in turn a germline familial hyperprolactinemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newey|first1=Paul|title=Mutant Prolactin Receptor and Familial Hyperprolactinemia|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=21 November 2013|pages=2012–2020|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1307557|accessdate=16 November 2014|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1307557|volume=369|pmc=4209110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; "Why is Epigenetics Important in Understanding the Pathogenesis of Inflammatory Musculoskeletal Diseases?": The publication went over the underlying effects [[epigenetics]] has on the pathogenesis of musculoskeletal diseases.  It mostly went over how the epigenetic machinery is extremely important in homeostasis and natural development.  The overview went over the therapeutic medicine relevant to [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and its development.  The researchers extend this claim by saying there are epigenetic implications with other autoimmune diseases and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oppermann|first1=Udo|title=Why Epigenetics Important in Understanding the Pathogenesis of Inflammatory Musculoskeletal Diseases?|journal=[[Arthritis Research &amp; Therapy]]|date=3 April 2013|volume=15|issue=209|doi=10.1186/ar4186|url=http://arthritis-research.com/content/15/2/209|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and Overview==
Weeds have existed since the advent of settled agriculture around 10,000 years ago it is been suggested that the most common characteristic of the ancestors of our presently dominant crop plants is their willingness—their tendency to be successful, to thrive, in disturbed habitats, mostly those around human dwellings. Farmers have likely always been aware of weeds in their crops, although the evidence for their awareness and concern is nearly all anecdotal. 

Unlike other agricultural sciences like [[entomology]] or [[plant pathology]], the emergence of weed science is comparatively recent largely within the 20th century. 
	
Weeds are controlled in much of the world by hand or with crude hoes. The size of a farmer's holding and yield per unit area are limited by several things and paramount among them is the rapidity with which a family can weed its crops. More human labor may be expended to weed crops than on any other single human enterprise, and most of that labor is expended by women. Weed control in the Western world and other developed areas of the world is done by sophisticated machines and by substituting chemical energy (herbicides) for mechanical and human energy. There is a relationship between the way farmers control weeds and the ability of a nation to feed its people. Successful weed management is one of the essential ingredients to maintain and increase food production. 
	
In 1923, Clark and Fletcher suggested that the "annual losses due to the occurrence of pernicious weeds on farm land in Canada, although acknowledged in a general way, are far greater than is realized."&lt;ref&gt; Clark, G.H. and J. Fletcher. Farm weeds of Canada. Second edition. Revised and enlarged by G. H. Clark first published in 1909. Reprinted by Canada Department of Agriculture. Ottawa, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; They thought this was because "farmers gave little critical attention to the weeds growing among their crops." They did not deny that farmers were aware of the weeds only that they could do little about them. Many of the same weeds described by Clark and Fletcher are shown in most current weed identification books. In spite of continued research to mitigate weeds annually many of the same species continue to be problematic. 
The first U.S. Congressional appropriation for weed control was made in 1901 for work on control of [[johnsongrass]], 23 years after Congress had appropriated funds for work on cotton insect pests. Petroleum-based herbicides were first used on California crop land in 1924 and soon became widely accepted in Southwestern states. In 1942, oils were used extensively for weed control in carrots and subsequently were used in forest nurseries. French scientists sprayed apple trees with dinitro dyes to control mosses, algae, and lichens. Some noticed that grasses that were wet from the spray did not die and that observation, or, more likely, a series of observations, led to the use of dinitros as herbicides for selective control of broadleaved weeds in cereals and flax. Sinox ([[sodium dinitro cresylate]]) was developed by Pastac in 1933.&lt;ref&gt; Pastac, I. 1973. Les colorants nitres et leurs applications particulieres. J. De al Hutte Chemique Contre les Ennemis das Cultures. 38:4.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the first selective organic herbicide introduced in the US. From the early 1930s until about 1945, it was used extensively in grains, clover hay, grass seed crops, peas, cane berries, onions, and lawns. 
 
Timmons, writing in 1970 reported that "available literature indicates that relatively few agricultural leaders and farmers became interested in weeds as a problem before 1200 A.D. or even before 1500 A.D."&lt;ref&gt; Timmons, F.L. 1970. A history of weed control in the United States and Canada. Weed Science 18:294-307. Republished Weed Science 53:748-761. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The “critical attention” Clark and Fletcher thought was absent increased slowly, primarily because the general attitude seemed to be that “weeds were a curse which must be endured, and about which little could be done except by methods which were incidental to crop production, and by laborious supplemental hand methods."

Jethro Tull, in 1731, appealed for greater attention to weeds:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is needless to go about to compute the value of the damage weeds do, since all experienced husbandmen know it to be 
very great, and would unanimously agree to extirpate their whole race as entirely as in England they have done the wolves, though        much more innocent and less rapacious than weeds.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Farmers however were bound by their inability to do much about weeds except by laborious hand methods.

Insects cause both human health and crop problems. Weeds, with a few exceptions, do not cause direct harm to humans. Those that do such as [[poison ivy]] and [[poison oak]] can be avoided. Poisonous weeds have never been widespread as a weed of crops nor of great concern to the majority of people. Many weeds aggravated human allergies but many did not and other common plants are also allergenic.  Insects and insecticides were respectively causes of and solutions to human disease problems. Weeds and herbicides were not and less attention was paid to them. Weeds and herbicides were agricultural problems. They were not of general societal concern. There were a few scientists interested in the study of weeds and in developing techniques to reduce the crop losses caused by weeds. There were only three full-time weed experts in 1934 and only a few part-time ones. 

By late 1951, 46 state agricultural experiment stations had active weed research programs and most of them were working on weed control with herbicides.   Now all colleges of agriculture in land-grant universities have weed scientists and a well-developed weed management program. 

Weed science has been strongly influenced by herbicides and mechanical technology developed by supporting industries, by research by weed scientists, and, ultimately, used by farmers. Herbicides greatly expanded the opportunities and range of methods for vegetation management and weed control. The definition accepted by the Weed Science Society of America (WSSA) is “A chemical substance or cultured biological organism used to kill or suppress the growth of plants.” 

Weed scientists have tended to focus on results and progress. Modern agriculture in the world's developed nations has addressed but not eliminated most weed problems through extensive use of herbicides and the more recent development of herbicide resistant crops through genetic modification. These methods while undeniably successful for their intended purpose also have created environmental, non-target species, and human health problems. Farmers in the world's developing nations use some herbicides but newer herbicides and the necessary application technology are often unavailable or too expensive. Weeds are always present in these farmer's fields but often the most available, affordable control methods are mechanical weeding, usually with animal power, or by hand, and most of the labor is provided by women. Neither the hypothesis that more energy is expended for the weeding man's crops than for any other single human task nor the corollary hypothesis that women do most of the world's weeding has been verified, but they are widely accepted.

{{distinguish|Wilderness}}

'''Wildness''', in its literal sense, is the quality of being [[Wildlife|wild]] or [[Domestication|untamed]]. Beyond this, it has been defined as a quality produced in [[nature]],&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; as that which emerges from a forest,&lt;ref&gt;Micoud 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a level of achievement in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Cookson 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has been defined as "a quality of interactive processing between organism and nature where the realities of base natures are met, allowing the construction of durable systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cookson |first=L. J. |title=A definition for wildness |journal=Ecopsychology |year=2011 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=187–193 |doi=10.1089/eco.2011.0028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[wilderness]] is a place where wildness occurs.

== Cultural perceptions of wildness ==
People have explored the contrast of wildness versus tameness throughout recorded history. The earliest great work of literature, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], tells a story of a wild man [[Enkidu]] in opposition to [[Gilgamesh]] who personifies civilization. In the story, Enkidu is defeated by Gilgamesh and becomes civilized. Cultures vary in their perception of the separation of humans from nature, with [[western civilization]] drawing a sharp contrast between the two while the traditions of many [[indigenous peoples]] have always seen humans as part of nature. The perception of man's place in nature and civilization has also changed over time. In western civilization, for example, [[Darwinism]] and environmentalism have renewed the perception of humans as part of nature, rather than separate from it.
 
Wildness is often mentioned in the writings of naturalists, such as [[John Muir]] and [[David Brower]], where it is admired for its freshness and otherness. [[Henry David Thoreau]] wrote the famous phrase, “In wildness is the preservation of the world.” Some artists and photographers such as [[Eliot Porter]] explore wildness in the themes of their works. The benefits of reconnecting with nature by seeing the achievements of wildness is an area being investigated by [[ecopsychology]].

Attempts to identify the characteristics of wildness are varied. One consideration sees wildness as that part of nature which is not controllable by humans. Nature retains a measure of autonomy, or wildness, apart from human constructions (Evanoff, 2005). Another version of this theme is that wildness produces things that are natural, while humans produce things that are artificial (man-made). Ambiguities about the distinction between the natural and the artificial animate much of art, literature and philosophy. There is the perception that naturally produced items have a greater elegance over artificial things. Modern zoos seek to improve the health and vigour of animals by simulating natural settings, in a move away from stark man-made structures.

Another view of wildness is that it is a social construct (Callicott 1994), and that humans cannot be considered innately ‘unnatural’. As wildness is claimed to be a quality that builds from animals and ecosystems, it often fails to be considered within reductionist theories for nature.

Meanwhile, an [[Ecology|ecological]] perspective sees wildness as "(the degree of) subjection to [[natural selection]] pressures", many of which emerge independently from the [[biosphere]].  Thus [[modern civilization]] - contrasted with all [[human]]ity – can be seen as an 'unnatural' force (lacking wildness) as it strongly insulates its population from many natural selection mechanisms, including [[interspecific competition]] such as predation and disease, as well as some [[intraspecific]] phenomena.

== Wildness in animals ==

The importance of maintaining wildness in animals is recognized in the management of [[Wilderness areas]]. Feeding wild animals in national parks for example, is usually discouraged because the animals may lose the skills they need to fend for themselves. Human interventions may also upset continued [[natural selection]] pressures upon the population, producing a version of [[domestication]] within wildlife (Peterson et al. 2005).

Tameness implies a reduction in wildness, where animals become more easily handled by humans. Some animals are easier to tame than others, and are amenable to domestication.

===Rating scales for mouse wildness===
In a clinical setting, ''wildness'' has been used as a scale to rate the ease with which various strains of laboratory mice can be captured and handled ([http://phenome.jax.org/pub-cgi/phenome/mpdcgi?rtn=projects/doc&amp;sym=Wahlsten2&amp;doc=protocol Wahlsten et al. 2003]):

|}

In this sense, "wildness" may be interpreted as "tendency to respond with anxiety to handling".  That there is no ''necessary'' connection between this factor and the state of wildness ''per se'', given that some animals in the wild may be handled with little or no cause of anxiety. However, this factor does clearly indicate an animal's resistance to being handled.

===Degrees of domestication===
{{main|Domestication}}
A [[Categorization|classification]] system can be set out showing the spectrum from wild to domesticated animal states:
* '''Wild''': These species experience their full life cycles without deliberate human intervention.
* '''Raised at [[zoo]]s or [[botanical garden]]s''' (captive): These species are nurtured and sometimes bred under human control, but remain as a group essentially indistinguishable in appearance or behaviour from their wild counterparts. (Zoos and botanical gardens sometimes exhibit domesticated or feral animals and plants such as [[camel]]s, [[Mustang (horse)|mustang]]s, and some [[orchids]].)
* '''Raised commercially''' (captive or semidomesticated): These species are [[ranch]]ed or [[farm]]ed in large numbers for food, commodities, or the pet trade, but as a group they are not substantially altered in appearance or behavior.  Examples include the [[elephant]], [[ostrich]], [[deer]], [[alligator]], [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]], [[pearl]] [[oyster]], and [[ball python]]. (These species are sometimes referred to as ''partially domesticated''.)
* '''Domesticated''': These species or varieties are bred and raised under human control for many generations and are substantially altered as a group in appearance or behaviour. Examples include the [[domestic canary|canary]], [[pigeon]]s, the [[budgerigar]], the [[peach-faced lovebird]], [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[sheep]], [[cattle]], [[chicken]]s, [[llama]]s, [[guinea pig]]s and laboratory [[mouse|mice]].

This classification system does not account for several complicating factors: [[genetically modified]] organisms, [[feral]] populations, and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]].  Many species that are farmed or ranched are now being genetically modified. This creates a unique category of them because it alters the organisms as a group but in ways unlike traditional domestication. Feral organisms are members of a population that was once raised under human control, but is now living and multiplying outside of human control.  Examples include [[Mustang (horse)|mustangs]].  Hybrids can be wild, domesticated, or both: a [[liger]] is a hybrid of two wild animals, a [[mule]] is a hybrid of two domesticated animals, and a [[beefalo]] is a cross between a wild and a domestic animal.

== Wildness in human psychology ==
{{main|Ecopsychology}}

The basic idea of ecopsychology is that while the human mind is shaped by the modern social world, it can be readily inspired and comforted by the wider natural world, because that is the arena in which it originally evolved. Mental health or unhealth cannot be understood in the narrow context of only intrapsychic phenomena or social relations. One also has to include the relationship of humans to other species and ecosystems. These relations have a deep evolutionary history; reach a natural affinity within the structure of their brains and they have deep psychic significance in the present time, in spite of urbanization. Humans are dependent on healthy nature not only for their physical sustenance, but for mental health, too.

== Wildness in political philosophy ==
{{main|State of nature}}

The concept of a state of nature was first posited by the 17th century English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''. Hobbes described the concept in the Latin phrase ''[[bellum omnium contra omnes]]'', meaning "the war of all against all." In this state any person has a [[natural right]] to do anything to preserve their own liberty or safety. Famously, he believed that such a condition would lead to a "war of every man against every man" and make life "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."

Hobbes's view was challenged in the eighteenth century by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who claimed that Hobbes was taking socialized persons and simply imagining them living outside of the society they were raised in. He affirmed instead that people were born neither good nor bad; men knew neither vice nor virtue since they had almost no dealings with each other. Their bad habits are the products of [[civilization]] specifically social hierarchies, [[property]], and markets. Another criticism put forth by [[Karl Marx]] is his concept of [[species-being]], or the unique potential of humans for dynamic, creative, and cooperative relations between each other. For Marx and others in his line of [[critical theory]], [[Social alienation|alienated]] and [[reification (Marxism)|abstracted]] social relations prevent the fulfillment of this potential (see [[anomie]]).

[[David Hume]]'s view brings together and challenges the theories of Rousseau and Hobbes. He posits that in the natural state we are born wicked and evil because of, for instance, the cry of the baby that demands attention. Like Rousseau, he believes that society shapes us, but that we are born evil and it is up to society to shape us into who we become.

[[Thoreau]] made many statements on wildness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In Wildness is the preservation of the World.  — "Walking"

I wish to speak a word for Nature, for absolute Freedom and Wildness, as contrasted with a Freedom and Culture merely civil, — to regard man as an inhabitant, or a part and parcel of Nature, rather than a member of society.  — "Walking"

I long for wildness, a nature which I cannot put my foot through, woods where the wood thrush forever sings, where the hours are early morning ones, and there is dew on the grass, and the day is forever unproved, where I might have a fertile unknown for a soil about me.  — Journal, 22 June 1853

As I came home through the woods with my string of fish, trailing my pole, it being now quite dark, I caught a glimpse of a woodchuck stealing across my path, and felt a strange thrill of savage delight, and was strongly tempted to seize and devour him raw; not that I was hungry then, except for that wildness which he represented.  — Walden

What we call wildness is a civilization other than our own.  — Journal, 16 February 1859

In Wildness is the preservation of the World.  — "Walking"

We need the tonic of wildness — to wade sometimes in marshes where the bittern and the meadow-hen lurk, and hearing the booming of the snipe; to smell the whispering sedge where only some wilder and more solitary fowl builds her nest, and the mink crawls with its belly close o the ground.  — Walden

It is in vain to dream of a wildness distant from ourselves. There is none such.  — Journal, 30 August 1856

The most alive is the wildest.  — "Walking"

Whatever has not come under the sway of man is wild. In this sense original and independent men are wild — not tamed and broken by society.  — Journal, 3 September 1851

Trench says a wild man is a willed man. Well, then, a man of will who does what he wills or wishes, a man of hope and of the future tense, for not only the obstinate is willed, but far more the constant and persevering. The obstinate man, properly speaking, is one who will not. The perseverance of the saints is positive willedness, not a mere passive willingness. The fates are wild, for they will; and the Almighty is wild above all, as fate is.  — Journal, 27 June 1853&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Wound contracture''' is a process that may occur during [[wound healing]] when an excess of [[wound contraction]], a normal healing process, leads to physical deformity characterized by skin constriction and functional limitations.&lt;ref name="Sabiston2012"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Sabiston | first1 = David C. | last2 = Townsend | first2 = Courtney M. | title = Sabiston textbook of surgery : the biological basis of modern surgical practi | date = 2012 | publisher = Elsevier Saunders | location = Philadelphia, PA | isbn = 978-1-4377-1560-6 | pages = 163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins2010"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Robbins | first1 = Stanley L.
