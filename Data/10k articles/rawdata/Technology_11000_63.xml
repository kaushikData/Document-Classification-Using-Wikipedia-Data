In [[computing]], an '''aperture''' is a portion of [[physical address]] space (i.e. [[Computer_data_storage#Primary_storage|physical memory]]) that is associated with a particular [[peripheral device]] or a [[computer memory|memory]] unit. Apertures may reach external devices such as [[read-only memory|ROM]] or [[random access memory|RAM]] chips, or internal memory on the [[central processing unit|CPU]] itself.

Typically, a memory device attached to a computer accepts addresses starting at zero, and so a system with more than one such device would have ambiguous addressing. To resolve this, the memory logic will contain several aperture [[multiplexer|selectors]], each containing a range selector and an interface to one of the memory devices. The set of selector address ranges of the apertures are disjoint. When the CPU presents a physical address within the range recognized by an aperture, the aperture unit routes the request (with the address remapped to a zero base) to the attached device. Thus, apertures form a layer of [[address space|address translation]] below the level of the usual virtual-to-physical mapping.

== History ==
The term "autapse" was first coined in 1972 by Van der Loos and Glaser, who observed them in Golgi preparations of the rabbit [[occipital cortex]] while originally conducting a quantitative analysis of rabbit [[neocortex]] circuitry.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van der Loos|first=H.|last2=Glaser|first2=E.

In 2000, they were first modeled as supporting persistence in [[recurrent neural networks]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2004, they were modeled as demonstrating [[Neural oscillation|oscillatory behavior]], which was absent in the same model neuron without autapse.&lt;ref name="Herrmann 2004" /&gt; More specifically, the neuron oscillated between high firing rates and firing suppression, reflecting the spike [[bursting]] behavior typically found in cerebral neurons. In 2009, autapses were, for the first time, associated with sustained activation. This proposed a possible function for excitatory autapses within a neural circuit.&lt;ref name="Activation" /&gt; In 2014, electrical autapses were shown to generate stable [[Target waves (neural field pattern)|target]] and [[Spiral waves (neural field pattern)|spiral waves]] in a [[Biological neuron model|neural model network]].&lt;ref name="Regulation" /&gt; This indicated that they played a significant role in stimulating and regulating the collective behavior of neurons in the network. In 2016, a model of resonance was offered.&lt;ref name="Resonance" /&gt;

Autapses have been used to simulate "same cell" conditions to help researchers make quantitative comparisons, such as studying how [[NMDA receptor|''N''-methyl-D-aspartate receptor]] (NMDAR) [[Receptor antagonist|antagonists]] affect synaptic versus extrasynaptic NMDARs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xia|first=Peng|last2=Chen|first2=Huei-sheng Vincent|last3=Zhang|first3=Dongxian|last4=Lipton|first4=Stuart A.|date=2010-08-18|title=Memantine Preferentially Blocks Extrasynaptic over Synaptic NMDA Receptor Currents in Hippocampal Autapses|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/30/33/11246|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=30|issue=33|pages=11246–11250|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2488-10.2010|issn=0270-6474|pmid=20720132|pmc=2932667|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207161423/http://www.jneurosci.org/content/30/33/11246|archivedate=2017-12-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
Recently, it has been proposed that autapses could possibly form as a result of neuronal signal transmission blockage, such as in cases of axonal injury induced by poisoning or impeding ion channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Chunni|last2=Guo|first2=Shengli|last3=Xu|first3=Ying|last4=Ma|first4=Jun|last5=Tang|first5=Jun|last6=Alzahrani|first6=Faris|last7=Hobiny|first7=Aatef|date=2017|title=Formation of Autapse Connected to Neuron and Its Biological Function|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2017/5436737/|journal=Complexity|language=en|volume=2017|pages=1–9|doi=10.1155/2017/5436737|issn=1076-2787|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207141405/https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2017/5436737/|archivedate=2017-12-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dendrites from the [[Soma (biology)|soma]] in addition to an auxiliary axon may develop to form an autapse to help remediate the neuron's signal transmission.

== Structure and function ==
Autapses can be either [[Glutamate (neurotransmitter)|glutamate-releasing]] (excitatory) or [[GABA neurotransmitter|GABA-releasing]] (inhibitory), just like their traditional synapse counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ikeda|first=Kaori|last2=Bekkers|first2=John M.|date=2006-05-09|title=Autapses|journal=Current Biology|volume=16|issue=9|pages=R308|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.03.085|issn=0960-9822|pmid=16682332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, autapses can be electrical or chemical by nature.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yilmaz|first=Ergin|last2=Ozer|first2=Mahmut|last3=Baysal|first3=Veli|last4=Perc|first4=Matjaž|date=2016-08-02|title=Autapse-induced multiple coherence resonance in single neurons and neuronal networks|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep30914|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1038/srep30914|issn=2045-2322|page=30914|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021071721/http://www.nature.com/articles/srep30914|archivedate=2016-10-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly speaking, negative feedback in autapses tends to inhibit excitable neurons whereas positive feedback can stimulate quiescent neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qin|first=Huixin|last2=Wu|first2=Ying|last3=Wang|first3=Chunni|last4=Ma|first4=Jun|title=Emitting waves from defects in network with autapses|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1007570414005280|journal=Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation|language=en|volume=23|issue=1–3|pages=164–174|doi=10.1016/j.cnsns.2014.11.008|year=2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207140618/http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1007570414005280|archivedate=2017-12-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the stimulation of inhibitory autapses did not induce [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarizing]] [[Inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibitory post-synaptic potentials]] in [[interneuron]]s of [[layer V]] of neocortical slices, they have been shown to impact excitability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bacci|first=Alberto|last2=Huguenard|first2=John R.|last3=Prince|first3=David A.|date=2003-02-01|title=Functional autaptic neurotransmission in fast-spiking interneurons: a novel form of feedback inhibition in the neocortex|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|volume=23|issue=3|pages=859–866|issn=1529-2401|pmid=12574414}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon using a GABA-antagonist to block autapses, the likelihood of an immediate subsequent second [[depolarization]] step increased following a first depolarization step. This suggests that autapses act by suppressing the second of two closely timed depolarization steps and therefore, they may provide feedback inhibition onto these cells. This mechanism may also potentially explain [[shunting inhibition]].

In cell culture, autapses have been shown to contribute to the prolonged activation of [[B31/B32 neurons]], which significantly contribute food-response behavior in ''[[Aplysia]]''.&lt;ref name="Activation" /&gt; This suggests that autapses may play a role in mediating positive feedback. It is important to note that the B31/B32 autapse was unable to play a role in initiating the neuron's activity, although it is believed to have helped sustain the neuron's depolarized state. The extent to which autapses maintain depolarization remains unclear, particularly since other components of the neural circuit (i.e. B63 neurons) are also capable of providing strong synaptic input throughout the depolarization. Additionally, it has been suggested that autapses provide B31/B32 neurons with the ability to quickly [[Repolarization|repolarize]]. Bekkers (2009) has proposed that specifically blocking the contribution of autapses and then assessing the differences with or without blocked autapses could better illuminate the function of autapses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bekkers|first=John M.|title=Synaptic Transmission: Excitatory Autapses Find a Function?|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2009.02.010|journal=Current Biology|volume=19|issue=7|pages=R296–R298|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.02.010|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hindmarsh–Rose model|Hindmarsh–Rose]] (HR) model neurons have demonstrated [[Chaotic spiking patterns|chaotic]], regular [[Spiking neural network|spiking]], [[Quiescent spiking patterns|quiescent]], and [[Periodic spiking patterns|periodic]] patterns of burst firing without autapses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Hengtong|last2=Ma|first2=Jun|last3=Chen|first3=Yueling|last4=Chen|first4=Yong|title=Effect of an autapse on the firing pattern transition in a bursting neuron|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2014.02.018|journal=Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation|volume=19|issue=9|pages=3242–3254|doi=10.1016/j.cnsns.2014.02.018|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the introduction of an electrical autapse, the periodic state switches to the chaotic state and displays an alternating behavior that increases in frequency with a greater autaptic intensity and time delay. On the other hand, excitatory chemical autapses enhanced the overall chaotic state. The chaotic state was reduced and suppressed in the neurons with inhibitory chemical autapses. In HR model neurons without autapses, the pattern of firing altered from quiescent to periodic and then to chaotic as [[Direct current|DC current]] was increased. Generally, HR model neurons with autapses have the ability to swap into any firing pattern, regardless of the prior firing pattern.

== Location ==

Neurons from several brain regions, such as the neocortex, substantia nigra, and hippocampus have been found to contain autapses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Melburn R.|last2=Lighthall|first2=James W.|last3=Kitai|first3=Stephen T.|title=Recurrent inhibition in the rat neostriatum|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(80)91217-2|journal=Brain Research|volume=194|issue=2|pages=359–369|doi=10.1016/0006-8993(80)91217-2|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karabelas|first=Athanasios B.|last2=Purrura|first2=Dominick P.|title=Evidence for autapses in the substantia nigra|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(80)90935-X|journal=Brain Research|volume=200|issue=2|pages=467–473|doi=10.1016/0006-8993(80)90935-x|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobb|first=S.R|last2=Halasy|first2=K|last3=Vida|first3=I|last4=Nyı́ri|first4=G|last5=Tamás|first5=G|last6=Buhl|first6=E.H|last7=Somogyi|first7=P|title=Synaptic effects of identified interneurons innervating both interneurons and pyramidal cells in the rat hippocampus|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0306-4522(97)00055-9|journal=Neuroscience|volume=79|issue=3|pages=629–648|doi=10.1016/s0306-4522(97)00055-9|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autapses have been observed to be relatively more abundant in GABAergic [[Basket cell|basket]] and [[dendrite-targeting cells]] of the cat visual cortex compared to spiny [[Stellate cell|stellate,]] [[double bouquet cells|double bouquet]], and [[pyramidal cell]]s, suggesting that the degree of neuron self-innervation is cell-specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tamás|first=G.|last2=Buhl|first2=E. H.|last3=Somogyi|first3=P.|date=1997-08-15|title=Massive autaptic self-innervation of GABAergic neurons in cat visual cortex|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|volume=17|issue=16|pages=6352–6364|issn=0270-6474|pmid=9236244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, dendrite-targeting cell autapses were, on average, further from the soma compared to basket cell autapses.

80% of layer V pyramidal neurons in developing rat neocortices contained autaptic connections, which were located more so on [[basal dendrite]]s and apical [[oblique dendrite]]s rather than main [[apical dendrite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lübke|first=J.|last2=Markram|first2=H.|last3=Frotscher|first3=M.|last4=Sakmann|first4=B.|date=1996-05-15|title=Frequency and dendritic distribution of autapses established by layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the developing rat neocortex: comparison with synaptic innervation of adjacent neurons of the same class|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|volume=16|issue=10|pages=3209–3218|issn=0270-6474|pmid=8627359}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dendritic positions of synaptic connections of the same cell type were similar to those of autapses, suggesting that autaptic and synaptic networks share a common mechanism of formation.

== Disease implications ==
In the 1990s, [[paroxysmal depolarizing shift]]-type [[Ictal|interictal epileptiform]] discharges has been suggested to be primarily dependent on autaptic activity for solitary excitatory hippocampal rat neurons grown in microculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Segal|first=M. M.|date=October 1994|title=Endogenous bursts underlie seizurelike activity in solitary excitatory hippocampal neurons in microcultures|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|volume=72|issue=4|pages=1874–1884|issn=0022-3077|pmid=7823106|doi=10.1152/jn.1994.72.4.1874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, in human neocortical tissues of patients with [[intractable epilepsy]], the GABAergic output autapses of [[fast-spiking]] (FS) neurons have been shown to have stronger [[Asynchronous neurotransmitter release|asynchronous release]] (AR) compared to both non-epileptic tissue and other types of synapses involving FS neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Man|last2=Zhu|first2=Jie|last3=Liu|first3=Yaping|last4=Yang|first4=Mingpo|last5=Tian|first5=Cuiping|last6=Jiang|first6=Shan|last7=Wang|first7=Yonghong|last8=Guo|first8=Hui|last9=Wang|first9=Kaiyan|date=2012-05-08|title=Enhancement of Asynchronous Release from Fast-Spiking Interneuron in Human and Rat Epileptic Neocortex|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001324|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=10|issue=5|pages=e1001324|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001324|issn=1545-7885|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207191812/http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001324|archivedate=2017-12-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found similar results using a rat model as well. An increase in residual Ca2+ concentration in addition to the action potential amplitude in FS neurons was suggested to cause this increase in AR of epileptic tissue. Anti-epileptic drugs could potentially target this AR of GABA that seems to rampantly occur at FS neuron autapses.

== Effects of drugs ==
Using a [[glia-conditioned medium]] to treat glia-free purified rat [[Retinal ganglion cell|retinal ganglion]] microcultures has been shown to significantly increase the number of autapses per neuron compared to a control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nägler|first=Karl|last2=Mauch|first2=Daniela H|last3=Pfrieger|first3=Frank W|date=2001-06-15|title=Glia-derived signals induce synapse formation in neurones of the rat central nervous system|journal=The Journal of Physiology|volume=533|issue=Pt 3|pages=665–679|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7793.2001.00665.x|issn=0022-3751|pmc=2278670|pmid=11410625}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that glia-derived soluble, [[proteinase K]]-sensitive factors induce autapse formation in rat retinal ganglion cells.

An '''autofocus''' (or '''AF''') [[optical]] system uses a [[sensor]], a [[control system]] and a [[Electric motor|motor]] to [[Focus (optics)|focus]] on an [[wikt:automatic|automatic]]ally or manually selected point or area. An [[Rangefinder_camera#Digital_rangefinder|electronic rangefinder]] has a display instead of the motor; the adjustment of the optical system has to be done manually until indication. Autofocus methods are distinguished by their type as being either [[Passivity (engineering)|active]], [[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] or hybrid variants.

Autofocus systems rely on one or more sensors to determine correct focus. Some AF systems rely on a single sensor, while others use an array of sensors. Most modern [[SLR camera]]s use [[Through-the-lens metering|through-the-lens]] optical  sensors, with a separate sensor array providing light [[Metering mode|metering]], although the latter can be programmed to prioritize its metering to the same area as one or more of the AF sensors.

Through-the-lens optical autofocusing is now often speedier and more precise than  can be achieved manually with an ordinary viewfinder, although more precise manual focus can be achieved with special accessories such as [[focusing magnifier]]s. Autofocus accuracy within 1/3 of the [[depth of field]] (DOF) at the widest [[aperture]] of the lens is common in professional AF SLR cameras.

Most multi-sensor AF cameras allow manual selection of the active sensor, and many offer automatic selection of the sensor using [[algorithms]] which attempt to discern the location of the subject. Some AF cameras are able to detect whether the subject is moving towards or away from the camera, including speed and acceleration data, and keep focus on the subject — a function used mainly in sports and other action photography; on Canon cameras this is known as [[AI servo]], while on Nikon cameras it is known as "continuous focus".

The data collected from AF sensors is used to control an [[electromechanical]] system that adjusts the focus of the optical system. A variation of autofocus is an ''[[Rangefinder_camera#Digital_rangefinder|electronic rangefinder]]'', a system in which focus data are provided to the operator, but adjustment of the optical system is still performed manually.

The speed of the AF system is highly dependent on the widest aperture offered by the lens. [[F-stop]]s of around {{f/}}2 to {{f/}}2.8 are generally considered optimal in terms of focusing speed and accuracy. Faster lenses than this (e.g.: {{f/}}1.4 or {{f/}}1.8) typically have very low depth of field, meaning that it takes longer to achieve correct focus, despite the increased amount of light.

Most consumer camera systems will only autofocus reliably with lenses that have a widest aperture of at least {{f/}}5.6, while professional models can often cope with lenses that have a widest aperture of {{f/}}8, which is particularly useful for lenses used in conjunction with [[teleconverter]]s. {{Citation needed|reason=Looks like original research.|date=October 2016}}

==History==
Between 1960 and 1973, Leitz (Leica)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfi-online.com/ceemes/page/show/issue_4_09_3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621131329/http://www.lfi-online.com/ceemes/page/show/issue_4_09_3 |archivedate=2009-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; patented an array of autofocus and corresponding sensor technologies.  At [[photokina 1976]], Leica had presented a camera based on their previous development, named Correfot, and in 1978 they displayed an SLR camera with fully operational autofocus. The first mass-produced autofocus camera was the [[Konica C35 AF]], a simple [[point and shoot camera|point and shoot]] model released in 1977. The [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] [[Polaroid SX-70|SX-70]] Sonar OneStep was the first autofocus [[single-lens reflex camera]], released in 1978. The [[Pentax ME F|Pentax ME-F]], which used focus sensors in the camera body coupled with a motorized [[photographic lens|lens]], became the first autofocus 35&amp;nbsp;mm [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] in 1981. In 1983 [[Nikon]] released the [[Nikon F3|F3AF]], their first autofocus camera, which was based on a similar concept to the ME-F. The [[Minolta 7000]], released in 1985, was the first SLR with an integrated autofocus system, meaning both the AF sensors and the drive motor were housed in the camera body, as well as an integrated film advance winder&amp;nbsp;— which was to become the standard configuration for SLR cameras from this manufacturer, and also Nikon abandoned their F3AF system and integrated the autofocus-motor and sensors in the body. [[Canon (company)|Canon]], however, elected to develop their EOS system with motorised lenses instead. In 1992, Nikon changed back to lens integrated motors with their AF-I and AF-S range of lenses; today their entry-level DSLRs do not have a focus motor in the body due to a broad [[List of Nikon F-mount lenses with integrated autofocus motors|range of available lenses with internal focus motors]].

==Active==
{{unrefsection|date=March 2014}}

Active AF systems measure distance to the subject independently of the optical system, and subsequently adjust the optical system for correct focus.

There are various ways to measure distance, including [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] sound waves and [[infrared]] light. In the first case, sound waves are emitted from the camera, and by measuring the delay in their reflection, distance to the subject is calculated. [[Instant camera|Polaroid]] cameras including the Spectra and [[Polaroid SX-70|SX-70]] were known for successfully applying this system. In the latter case, infrared light is usually used to [[triangulation|triangulate]] the distance to the subject. Compact cameras including the [[Nikon]] 35TiQD and 28TiQD, the [[Canon AF35M]], and the [[Contax T|Contax T2 and T3]], as well as early video cameras, used this system. A newer approach included in some consumer electronic devices, like mobile phones, is based on the [[Time of flight|time-of-flight]] principle, which involves shining a laser or LED light to the subject and calculating the distance based on the time it takes for the light to travel to the subject and back. This technique is sometimes called ''laser autofocus'', and is present in many mobile phone models from several vendors.

An exception to the two-step approach is the mechanical autofocus provided in some enlargers, which adjust the lens directly.

==Passive==
Passive AF systems determine correct focus by performing passive analysis of the image that is entering the optical system. They generally do not direct any energy, such as ultrasonic sound or infrared light waves, toward the subject. (However, an autofocus assist beam of usually infrared light is required when there is not enough light to take passive measurements.) Passive autofocusing can be achieved by phase detection or contrast measurement.

===Phase detection===
[[File:Autofocus phase detection.svg|thumb|300px|Phase detection: In each figure (not to scale), the purple circle represents the object to be focused on, the red and green lines represent light rays passing through apertures at the opposite sides of the lens, the yellow rectangle represents sensor arrays (one for each aperture), and the graph represents the intensity profile as seen by each sensor array. Figures 1 to 4 represent conditions where the lens is focused (1) too near, (2) correctly, (3) too far and (4) much too far. The phase difference between the two profiles can be used to determine in which direction and how much to move the lens to achieve optimal focus.]]

Phase detection (PD) is achieved by dividing the incoming light into pairs of images and comparing them. [[Through-the-lens metering|Through-the-lens]] secondary image registration (TTL SIR) passive phase detection is often used in film and digital [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR cameras]]. The system uses a [[beam splitter]] (implemented as a small semi-transparent area of the main reflex mirror, coupled with a small secondary mirror) to direct light to an AF sensor at the bottom of the camera. Two micro-lenses capture the light rays coming from the opposite sides of the lens and divert it to the AF sensor, creating a simple [[rangefinder]] with a base within the lens's diameter. The two images are then analysed for similar light intensity patterns (peaks and valleys) and the separation error is calculated in order to find whether the object is in [[front focus]] or [[back focus]] position. This gives the direction and an estimate of the required amount of focus-ring movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nikon.com/about/technology/rd/core/software/caf/index.htm|title=Nikon - Technology - Predictive Focus Tracking System|publisher=|access-date=2013-11-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112195552/http://www.nikon.com/about/technology/rd/core/software/caf/index.htm|archive-date=2013-11-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PD AF in a continuously focusing mode (e.g. "AI Servo" for [[Canon EOS|Canon]], "AF-C" for [[Nikon#Digital_single_lens_reflex_cameras|Nikon]], [[Pentax_cameras#Digital|Pentax]] and [[Sony#Photography|Sony]]) is a [[closed-loop control]] process. PD AF in a focus-locking mode (e.g. "One-Shot" for [[Canon EOS|Canon]], "AF-S" for [[Nikon#Digital_single_lens_reflex_cameras|Nikon]] and [[Sony#Photography|Sony]]) is widely believed to be a "one measurement, one movement" [[open-loop control]] process, but focus is confirmed only when the AF sensor sees an in-focus subject. The only apparent differences between the two modes are that a focus-locking mode halts on focus confirmation, and a continuously focusing mode has predictive elements to work with moving targets, which suggests they are the same closed-loop process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpreview.com/articles/5402438893/busted-the-myth-of-open-loop-phase-detection-autofocus|title=Busted! The Myth of Open-loop Phase-detection Autofocus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although AF sensors are typically one-dimensional photosensitive strips (only a few pixels high and a few dozen wide), some modern cameras ([[Canon EOS-1V]], [[Canon EOS-1D]], [[Nikon D2X]]) feature TTL area SIR{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} sensors that are rectangular in shape and provide two-dimensional intensity patterns for a finer-grain analysis.  Cross-type focus points have a pair of sensors oriented at 90° to one another, although one sensor typically requires a larger aperture to operate than the other.

Some cameras ([[Minolta 7]], [[Canon EOS-1V]], [[Canon EOS-1D|1D]], [[Canon EOS 30D|30D]]/[[Canon EOS 40D|40D]], [[Sony DSLR-A700]], [[Sony DSLR-A850|DSLR-A850]], [[Sony DSLR-A900|DSLR-A900]]) also have a few "high-precision" focus points with an additional set of prisms and sensors; they are only active with "[[Lens speed#Fast lenses|fast lenses]]" with certain geometrical apertures (typically [[f-number]] 2.8 and faster). Extended precision comes from the wider effective measurement base of the "range finder".

===Contrast detection===
Contrast-detection autofocus is achieved by measuring contrast within a sensor field [[Through-the-lens metering|through the lens]]. The intensity difference between adjacent pixels of the sensor naturally increases with correct image focus. The optical system can thereby be adjusted until the maximal contrast is detected. In this method, AF does not involve actual distance measurement at all. This creates significant challenges when tracking moving subjects, since a loss of contrast gives no indication of the direction of motion towards or away from the camera. 

Contrast-detect autofocus is a common method in [[digital camera]]s that lack [[Shutter (photography)|shutter]]s and reflex mirrors.  Most [[digital single-lens reflex camera|DSLR]]s use this method (or a hybrid of both contrast and phase-detection autofocus) when focusing in their [[live-preview digital camera|live-view]] modes. A notable exception is Canon digital cameras with Dual Pixel CMOS AF. [[Mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera]]s typically used contrast-measurement autofocus, although phase detection has become the norm on most mirrorless cameras giving them significantly better AF tracking performance compared to contrast detection.

Contrast detection places different constraints on lens design when compared with phase detection. While phase detection requires the lens to move its focus point quickly and directly to a new position, contrast-detection autofocus instead employs lenses that can quickly sweep through the focal range, stopping precisely at the point where maximal contrast is detected. This means that lenses designed for phase detection often perform poorly on camera bodies that use contrast detection.

==={{anchor|Illuminator}}Assist lamp===
The assist light (also known as AF illuminator) "activates" passive autofocus systems in low-light and low-[[Contrast (vision)|contrast]] situations in some cameras. The lamp projects visible or [[infrared|IR]] light onto the subject, which the camera's autofocus system uses to achieve focus. Many cameras that do not have a dedicated autofocus assist lamp instead use their built-in flash, illuminating the subject with stroboscopic bursts of light. The strobe bursts aid the autofocus system in the same fashion as a dedicated assist light, but have the disadvantage of startling or annoying living subjects. Another disadvantage is that if the camera uses flash focus assist and is set to an operation mode that overrides the flash, it may also disable the focus assist and autofocus may fail to acquire the subject.  Similar stroboscopic flashing is sometime used to reduce the [[red-eye effect]], but this method is only intended to constrict the subject's eye pupils prior to the actual shot being taken, and thus reduce retinal reflections.

In some cases, external flash guns have integrated autofocus assist lamps that replace the stroboscopic on-camera flash. Another way to assist contrast based AF systems in low light is to beam a laser pattern on to the subject. The laser method is commercially called Hologram AF Laser and was used in Sony Cybershot cameras around the year 2003, including Sony's F707, F717 and F828 models.

==Hybrid autofocus==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2018}} 
In a hybrid autofocus system, focus is achieved by combining two or more methods, such as:

* Active and passive methods
* Phase detection and contrast measurement

The double effort is typically used to mutually compensate for the intrinsical weaknesses of the various methods in order to increase the overall reliability and accuracy or to speed up AF function.

A rare example of an early hybrid system is the combination of an active IR or ultrasonic auto-focus system with a passive phase-detection system. An IR or ultrasonic system based on timed reflection will work regardless of the light conditions, but can be easily fooled by obstacles like window glasses, and the accuracy is typically restricted to a rather limited number of steps. Phase-detection autofocus "sees" through window glasses without problems and is much more accurate, but it does not work in low-light conditions or on surfaces without contrasts or with repeating patterns.

A very common example of combined usage is the phase-detection auto-focus system used in single-lens reflex cameras since the 1985s. The passive phase-detection auto-focus needs some contrast to work with, making it difficult to use in low-light scenarios or on even surfaces. An [[AF illuminator]] will illuminate the scene and project contrast patterns onto even surfaces, so that phase-detection auto-focus can work under these conditions as well.

A newer form of a hybrid system is the combination of passive phase-detection auto-focus and passive contrast auto-focus, sometimes assisted by active methods, as both methods need some visible contrast to work with. Under their operational conditions, phase-detection auto-focusing is very fast, since the measurement method provides both information, the amount of offset and the direction, so that the focusing motor can move the lens right into (or close to) focus without additional measurements. Additional measurements on the fly, however, can improve accuracy or help keep track of moving objects. However, the accuracy of phase-detection auto-focus depends on its effective measurement basis. If the measurement basis is large, measurements are very accurate, but can only work with lenses with a large geometrical aperture (e.g. 1:2.8 or larger). Even with high contrasty objects, phase-detection AF cannot work at all with lenses slower than its effective measurement basis. In order to work with most lenses, the effective measurement basis is typically set to between 1:5.6 and 1:6.7, so that AF continues to work with slow lenses (at least for as long as they are not stopped down). This, however, reduces the intrinsical accuracy of the autofocus system, even if fast lenses are used. Since the effective measurement basis is an optical property of the actual implementation, it cannot be changed easily. Very few cameras provide multi-PD-AF systems with several switchable measurement bases depending on the lens used in order to allow normal auto-focusing with most lenses, and more accurate focusing with fast lenses.
Contrast AF does not have this inherit design limitation on accuracy as it only needs a minimal object contrast to work with. Once this is available, it can work with high accuracy regardless of the speed of a lens; in fact, for as long as this condition is met, it can even work with the lens stopped down. Also, since contrast AF continues to work in stopped-down mode rather than only in open-aperture mode, it is immune to [[Spherical aberration|aperture-based focus shift errors]] phase-detection AF systems suffer since they cannot work in stopped-down mode. Thereby, contrast AF makes arbitrary fine-focus adjustments by the user unnecessary. Also, contrast AF is immune to focusing errors due to surfaces with repeating patterns and they can work over the whole frame, not just near the center of the frame, as phase-detection AF does. The down-side, however, is that contrast AF is a closed-loop iterative process of shifting the focus back and forth in rapid succession. Compared to phase-detection AF, contrast AF is slow, since the speed of the focus iteration process is mechanically limited and this measurement method does not provide any directional information. Combining both measurement methods, the phase-detection AF can assist a contrast AF system to be fast and accurate at the same time, to compensate aperture-based focus-shift errors, and to continue to work with lenses stopped down, as, for example, in stopped-down measuring or video mode.

Recent developments towards mirrorless cameras seek to integrate the phase-detection AF sensors into the image sensor itself. Typically, these phase-detection sensors are not as accurate as the more sophisticated stand-alone sensors, but since the fine focusing is now carried out through contrast focusing, the phase-detection AF sensors are only need to provide coarse directional information in order to speed up the contrast auto-focusing process.

In July, 2010, [[Fujifilm]] announced a compact camera, the F300EXR, which included a hybrid autofocus system consisting of both phase-detection and contrast-based elements.  The sensors implementing the phase-detection AF in this camera are integrated into the camera's [[Super CCD]] EXR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fujifilmusa.com/press/news/display_news?newsID=879875 Fujifilm Launches Powerhouse 15X Long Zoom Point and shoot Digital Camera: The FinePix F300EXR], Fujifilm, USA&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently it is used by [[Fujifilm FinePix]] Series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dpreview.com/news/2013/01/07/Fujifilm-finepix-hs50-exr-hs35 |title=Fujifilm launches FinePix HS50EXR and HS35EXR high-end superzooms |accessdate=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fujifilm X100S, [[Ricoh]], [[Nikon 1 series]], [[Canon EOS 650D|Canon EOS 650D/Rebel T4i]] and [[Samsung NX300]].

==Comparison of active and passive systems==
Active systems will typically not focus through windows, since sound waves and infrared light are reflected by the glass. With passive systems this will generally not be a problem, unless the window is stained. Accuracy of active autofocus systems is often considerably less than that of passive systems.

Active systems may also fail to focus a subject that is very close to the camera (e.g., [[macro photography]]).

Passive systems may not find focus when the contrast is low, notably on large single-colored surfaces (walls, blue sky, etc.) or in low-light conditions.  Passive systems are dependent on a certain degree of illumination to the subject (whether natural or otherwise), while active systems may focus correctly even in total darkness when necessary. Some cameras and external flash units have a special low-level illumination mode (usually orange/red light) which can be activated during auto-focus operation to allow the camera to focus.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Trap focus==
A method variously referred to as ''trap focus'', ''focus trap'', or ''catch-in-focus'' uses autofocus to take a shot when a subject moves into the focal plane (at the relevant focal point); this can be used to get a focused shot of a rapidly moving object, particularly in sports or wildlife photography, or alternatively to set a "trap" so that a shot can automatically be taken without a person present. This is done by using AF to ''detect'' but not ''set'' focus&amp;nbsp;– using manual focus to set focus (or switching to manual after focus has been set) but then using ''[[focus priority]]'' to detect focus and only release the shutter when an object is in focus. The technique works by choosing the focus adjustment (turning AF off), then setting the shooting mode to "Single" (AF-S), or more specifically focus priority, then depressing the shutter&amp;nbsp;– when the subject moves into focus, the AF detects this (though it does not change the focus), and a shot is taken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shutterstock.com/tips-tricks/Trap-Focus-for-Nikon-Users-100.html Trap Focus for Nikon Users], by Kenneth William Caleno, January 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/sports.htm How to shoot sport], Ken Rockwell, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://photographyrulez.blogspot.com/2009/04/focus-trap-or-catch-in-focus.html Focus Trap or Catch In Focus], April 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The first SLR to implement trap focusing was the [[Yashica 230 AF]]. Trap focus is also possible on some Pentax (e.g. K-x and K-5), Nikon, and [[Canon EOS]] cameras. The EOS 1D can do it using software on an attached computer, whereas cameras like the EOS 40D and 7D have a custom function (III-1 and III-4 respectively) which can stop the camera trying to focus after it fails.{{cn|date=September 2013|reason=The description for the 40D and 7D does not sound as if they would actually support focus trapping. Please provide references.}} On EOS cameras without genuine trap focus, a hack called "almost trap focus" can be used, which achieves some of the effects of trap focus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eosdoc.com/manuals/?q=ATrapFocus EOS Documentation Project: Almost Trap Focus] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818143041/http://eosdoc.com/manuals/?q=ATrapFocus |date=August 18, 2010 }}, by Julian Loke&lt;/ref&gt; By using the custom firmware [[DIGIC#Magic_Lantern|Magic Lantern]], some Canon DSLRs can perform trap focus.

===AI Servo===
AI Servo is an autofocus mode found on [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] SLR cameras. The same principle is used by other brands such as [[Nikon]], [[Sony]], and [[Pentax]], called "continuous focus" (AF-C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpreview.com/learn/?/Glossary/Camera_System/af_servo_01.htm|title=Articles tagged "learn": Digital Photography Review|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also referred to as ''focus tracking'', it is used to track a subject as it moves around the frame, or toward and away from the camera.  When in use, the lens will constantly maintain its focus on the subject, hence it is commonly used for sports and action photography. AI refers to [[artificial intelligence]]: algorithms that constantly predict where a subject is about to be based on its speed and acceleration data from the autofocus sensor.

== Focus motors ==
Modern autofocus is done through one of two mechanisms; either a motor in the camera body and gears in the lens ("screw drive") or through electronic transmission of the drive instruction through contacts in the mount plate to a motor in the lens. Lens-based motors can be of a number of different types, but are often [[ultrasonic motor]]s or [[stepper motor]]s.

Some camera bodies, including all [[Canon EOS]] bodies and the more budget-oriented among [[Nikon DX|Nikon's DX]] models, do not include an autofocus motor and therefore cannot autofocus with lenses that lack an inbuilt motor. Some lenses, such as [[Pentax DA* lenses|Pentax' DA*]] designated models, although normally using an inbuilt motor, can fall back to screwdrive operation when the camera body does not support the necessary contact pins.

[[File:Bhdwrview1963.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Baldwin Hills Reservoir after 1963 failure, view south. The gash through the dam corresponds to the alignment of a fault.]]

The '''Baldwin Hills Dam disaster''' occurred on December 14, 1963, when the dam containing the '''Baldwin Hills Reservoir''' suffered a catastrophic failure and flooded the residential neighborhoods surrounding it. It began with signs of lining failure, followed by increasingly serious leakage through the dam at its east abutment. After three hours the dam breached, with a total release of {{convert|250|e6USgal|m3}}, resulting in five deaths and the destruction of 277 homes. Vigorous rescue efforts averted a greater loss of life.

The reservoir was located on a low hilltop in [[Baldwin Hills, Los Angeles, California]]. It was constructed between 1947 and 1951 by the [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power]] directly on an active [[fault line]], which was subsidiary to the well known nearby [[Newport–Inglewood Fault]]. The underlying geologic strata were considered unstable for a reservoir, and the design called for a compacted soil lining meant to prevent seepage into the foundation. The fault lines were considered during planning but were deemed by some, although not all, of the engineers and geologists involved as not significant.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;Scott 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

The former reservoir is now part of the [[Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area]].

==Significance and diagnoses of the failure==
The failure of the Baldwin Hills Reservoir received an exceptional amount of attention from the [[civil engineering]] community and remains the subject of continuing interest. The reservoir had been conceived, designed, and built during and after World War II, a time when the pace of dam building was accelerating even as some disastrous dam failures were occurring, indicating a need for safer technologies. The builders of the Baldwin Hills dam, the [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power]], were aware of the difficult geologic conditions presented by the site and knew from past experiences, notably the [[catastrophic failure]] of the [[St. Francis Dam]] in 1928 in which over 400 people lost their lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Stansell|first=Ann|url=https://www.academia.edu/11242671/Memorialization_and_Memory_of_Southern_Californias_St._Francis_Dam_Disaster_of_1928|title=Memorialization and Memory of Southern California's St. Francis Dam Disaster of 1928|journal=California State University, Northridge|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stansell|first=Ann C.|url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/annstansell_damvictims022214.htm|title=Roster of St. Francis Dam Disaster Victims|publisher= Santa Clarita Valley History In Pictures|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the serious consequences of a failure, even of a small reservoir in an urban setting. But this was also an era of new engineering ventures onland, sea, and space, with new technologies boldly advanced to meet what were seen as hostile challenges from both nature and communist ideologies.{{failed verification|date=February 2017|reason=Unsourced speculation.}} While dams were recognized as potentially dangerous, like nuclear technologies, they were also considered by Americans as a showcase technology—a means of fending off danger and spreading progressive American technologies and associated social benefits at home and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Meehan, RL 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baldwin Hills dam designer, engineer Ralph Proctor, had also worked as an assistant civil engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power on the failed [[St. Francis Dam]]&lt;ref&gt;Coroner's Inquest 1928&lt;/ref&gt; and had subsequently devised new methods of producing compacted earth fill in building its replacement.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Proctor aggressively proceeded with the Baldwin Hills project even in the face of safety concerns and disagreements over important design details raised within his own department.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt;

Late 1963, when the failure occurred, was a time of another notable public disaster. Only two months before at the [[Vajont Dam]] in Italy, a massive landslide into the reservoir behind it, created a seiche which overtopped the dam flooding the valley below and causing the deaths of approximately 2000 people.  The Baldwin Hills Reservoir had been built, as were others, to assure an ample supply of safe water for the people of Los Angeles in case of catastrophe such as earthquake, fire, or war, and its failure was a blow to engineering confidence and the subject of many writings and two professional conferences (1972 and 1987, see references). The failure occurred shortly after the death of the authoritative Harvard engineer [[Karl Terzaghi]] whose ideas had long dominated both earth dam engineering and the engineering science of [[soil mechanics]]; Terzaghi had also made significant contributions to understanding subsidence in oilfields. This left the assessment of the Baldwin Hills failure in the hands of a new generation of engineers, some who took on conflicting roles as experts in various lawsuits.

The design and construction of the dam had been inspected and approved by the California Department of Water Resources. A meticulously documented study published by that agency in 1964—while pointing out various connections between oilfield operations in the [[Inglewood Oil Field]] and ground disturbances in the area, including beneath the reservoir and at some distance from the reservoir—concluded rather vaguely that the failure was due to "an unfortunate combination of physical factors".&lt;ref name="California"&gt;California 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

The monetary damages resulting from the failure were large, and some of the investigations which followed the state study were sponsored by litigants seeking more specific conclusions relevant to legal liability. This drew attention to oilfield operations in the area. From the outset it was clear that the ground faulting and [[fault creep]] which destroyed the reservoir were probably related to the many feet of ground subsidence which had occurred a half mile west of the reservoir over decades of oil extraction in the Inglewood field. The oilfield-related subsidence in the Inglewood field, though generally denied by the oil companies as a legal policy, was documented exhaustively by the US Geological Survey in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Castle 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Subsidence following oil extraction from shallow deposits in unconsolidated sediments had been understood by oil industry experts since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Geertsma 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the discovery in 1970 by geologist Douglas Hamilton of faulting and surface seepage of oilfield waste brines along the fault which traversed and extended south of the reservoir, Hamilton and Meehan concluded that oilfield injection for waste disposal and improved recovery of oil, a new technology at the time, was a significant cause of the failure, triggering hydraulic fracturing and aggravating movements on a fault traversing the reservoir even on the day of the failure.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the US Geological Survey concluded in 1976 that displacements at the ground surface causing reservoir failure and also ground cracking in the Stocker-LaBrea area southeast of the reservoir were 90 percent or more attributable to exploitation of the Inglewood oil field, and that this faulting was likely aggravated by waterflooding with pressures exceeding hydraulic fracturing levels.&lt;ref&gt;Castle and Yerkes  1976&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1972, nearly a decade after the failure, the immediate legal issues had been settled out of court and the matter was reopened as a topic of discussion among investigators in a published engineering conference at Purdue University.

Engineer Thomas Leps, who had served as consultant on the 1964 state investigation, took on a role as neutral reviewer in this and most subsequent American studies of the failure. Leps concluded that there had been about 7&amp;nbsp;inches of offset on the fault beneath the reservoir during its life, about 2&amp;nbsp;inches of which had occurred in the months just before the failure. Leps associated the latter with repressurization of the oilfield.  This, along with stretching of the ground due to subsidence of about 12 feet from oil extraction, had caused the lining failure which doomed the reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;Leps 1972 p. 541&lt;/ref&gt;

Some prominent consultants including those on a team led by Arthur Casagrande, Harvard successor to Karl Terzaghi, held that oilfield operations were not a significant influence at all but that the failure was the result of defective siting and design with the heavy weight of the dam and reservoir being the significant cause of the fatal foundation movement.&lt;ref&gt;Casagrande 1972&lt;/ref&gt; This view exonerated the oil companies, namely Standard Oil, which had sponsored the study. Casagrande refused to acknowledge any ground movements in the area as being related to oilfield operations and argued that ground movements that affected the dam were found only beneath the reservoir, not in adjoining areas.

Most of these questions were examined once again in 1986 following investigations of a suspiciously similar major failure of the Bureau of Reclamation's [[Teton Dam]] in June, 1976, and a near failure of the Department of Water and Power's Lower Van Norman Dam in the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake]]. Professor Ronald Scott of Caltech, who had participated in the Casagrande studies, noted at a follow-up 1987 conference on Baldwin Hills&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt; that Casagrande had ignored or been unaware of ground movements clearly unrelated to the reservoir (e.g. those at Stocker-LaBrea) in his analysis. Another engineer, Stanley Wilson—who had also worked with Casagrande on the 1972 studies and supported the claim that oilfield subsidence was an insignificant cause—now conceded that analogous ground offsets extended well outside the reservoir area, notably in the Stocker-LaBrea area, so that the reservoir and other fault movements could not be attributed to the reservoir itself—thus tacitly attributing responsibility for the failure to oilfield operations. Hence, there appeared to be convergence of opinion on the role of oilfield subsidence and repressurization.

[[File:BaldwinHillsFailureAnimation.gif|thumb|right|300px|Fluid withdrawal (pink)-injection (purple) model of fault movement and Baldwin Hills Dam failure. Injection pressures exceeded hydrofracture pressures and the recorded timing of the fault offset support the injection as being the decisive factor.&lt;ref name="Meehan 2012"&gt;Meehan 2012&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The issue of oilfield causation was a central theme in most of these discussions, with little attention having been directed to the details of the failure. The absolute necessity of a lining for this site was generally taken for granted in these proceedings even as it had been by Proctor himself, regardless of the fact that almost all earth dams perform satisfactorily without linings. Some suggestions as to possible preventive design and construction techniques that might have made the dam safer were raised to engineering consensus and reached a state of textbook knowledge in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;James Ed Al 1988&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the character of the compacted earth lining (which had been regularly referred to as clay but must have been substantially silt and sand, having been derived from the local Inglewood formation&lt;ref name="California" /&gt;) was raised, if obliquely, in the suggestion made in the end that improved performance might have come from the use of a different lining material.&lt;ref&gt;James et al 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 a new angle on failure analysis was introduced by Mahunthan and Schofield, who concluded that overcompaction of the dam fill and lining was a significant aggravating factor in both the Baldwin Hills and Teton failures.&lt;ref&gt;Muhunthan and Schofield 2001&lt;/ref&gt; This assertion was based on Schofield's concepts of critical-state soil mechanics,&lt;ref&gt;Schofield 2006&lt;/ref&gt; a corollary of which was that heavily compacted but lightly confined soils could be dangerously unstable where seepage forces were present. This issue had not been raised in the previous American-dominated discussions and remains in some degree contrary to American ideas in both theoretical soil mechanics and practical geotechnical engineering. In fact the 1964 DWR failure study implied that heavy compaction was a favored technique for earth dam construction,&lt;ref&gt;California 1964 p. 11 and Table V-2&lt;/ref&gt; and this assumption appeared not to have been reexamined over the twenty five years of post-failure investigation and discussion.

The failure of the reservoir has been a subject of ongoing interest in the field of dam breach studies. A recent study examined the dam failure as a two-stage process and succeeded in modeling the flood in the urban area downstream.&lt;ref&gt;Gallegos et al 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Baldwin Hills Reservoir site has now been dedicated as a community park, and there is no further significant hazard associated with ground movements there, the associated faults to the southeast (Stocker-LaBrea and the Windsor School area) continue to move significantly as of 2012, causing damage to private and public facilities. The current oilfield operator, Plains Exploration and Production Company (PXP), which has intensified production and development efforts in the oilfield with the rising price of petroleum, does not, unlike its predecessor Standard Oil, acknowledge any causal connection between fault movements and oilfield activities, and has retained a team of consultants who support this position or conclude that the causes of the movements are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;StrataGen Engineering 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The role of shallow [[Hydraulic fracturing in the United States|hydraulic fracturing]], which has recently been introduced as a means of stimulating production at depths of about 2000 feet in the southeast part of the Inglewood field,&lt;ref name="Moodie 2004"&gt;Moodie 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and at greater depths elsewhere in the field, has also generated public concern and controversy. However, oil operators, while admitting that fracture pressures&lt;ref&gt;Hubbert 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Castle 1976&lt;/ref&gt; are being exceeded,&lt;ref name="Moodie 2004"/&gt; do not acknowledge a relationship between injection at fracturing pressure levels and fault movement. The PXP and PXP consultant conclusions, that adverse effects are either unknown or not present, are disputed by other reviewers.&lt;ref name="Meehan 2012"/&gt;

Recent discharges of oilfield gases in the Baldwin Hills may also be related to raised pressures resulting from injection, and may be of similar origin as the gas problems in the nearby Salt lake field.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coverage==

[[KTLA]] used a helicopter to cover the disaster. Common today, this was perhaps the first such live aerial coverage&lt;!--pictures or film via wireless transmission? (I am not a native speaker) --&gt; of a breaking news event. [[Richard N. Levine]], a 17-year-old photography student, rushed to a higher viewpoint and made 35-mm-pictures of the evolving dam break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serene Hilltop Marks Site of Landmark Disaster|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/dec/11/local/me-surround11|first=Bob|last=Pool|date=December 11, 2003|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11200">[[Image:Black Liquor.jpg|thumb|200px|A black liquor sample]]

In [[industrial chemistry]], '''black liquor''' is the waste product from the [[kraft process]] when digesting [[pulpwood]] into [[Pulp (paper)|paper pulp]] removing [[lignin]], [[hemicellulose]]s and other extractives from the wood to free the [[cellulose]] fibers.&lt;ref name="PSaT"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= Per |editor1-last= Stenius |title= Forest Products Chemistry|edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 3 |year= 2000 |publisher= Fapet OY |location=Helsinki, Finland |language= |isbn=952-5216-03-9 |page= |pages= 62–78|chapter= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equivalent material in the [[sulfite process]] is usually called brown liquor, but the terms red liquor, thick liquor and sulfite liquor are also used.

==Composition==

Approximately 7 tonnes of black liquor are produced in the manufacture of one tonne of pulp.&lt;ref name="bier"&gt;{{cite book |last=Biermann |first=Christopher J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Essentials of Pulping and Papermaking |year=1993 |publisher=Academic Press, Inc. |location=San Diego |isbn=0-12-097360-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The black liquor is an aqueous solution of lignin residues, hemicellulose, and the [[inorganic compound|inorganic chemicals]] used in the process. The black liquor comprises 15% solids by weight of which 10% are organic chemicals and 5% are inorganic chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Pulping and Papermaking SE, 1996, {{ISBN|0-12-097362-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the organics in black liquor are 40-45% soaps{{Citation needed|reason=Unrealistic. Extractives, and soaps, are only a minor component of wood. See yield of tall oil from the Kraft process|date=September 2018}}, 35-45% lignin and 10-15% other organics.

The [[organic compound|organic matter]] in the black liquor is made up of water/alkali soluble degradation components from the wood.&lt;ref name="PSaT" /&gt; [[Lignin]] is degraded to shorter fragments with sulphur content at 1-2% and sodium content at about 6% of the dry solids. [[Cellulose]] and [[hemicellulose]] is degraded to aliphatic carboxylic acid soaps and hemicellulose fragments. The extractives gives [[tall oil]] soap and crude [[turpentine]]. The soaps contain about 20% sodium.

The residual lignin components currently serve for hydrolytic or pyrolytic conversion or just burning only. Hemicellulosis may undergo fermentation processes, alternatively.

==History==
Early kraft pulp mills discharged black liquor to watercourses. Black liquor is quite toxic to aquatic life, and causes a very dark [[caramel color]] in the water.  The invention of the [[recovery boiler]] by G.H. Tomlinson in the early 1930s, was a milestone in the advancement of the kraft process.&lt;ref name="eero"&gt;{{cite book |author= E. Sjöström |title= Wood Chemistry: Fundamentals and Applications |publisher= [[Academic Press]]|year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2000,{{citation needed|date=June 2009}} the better kraft mills recovered 99.5% or more of the black liquor, and purified the remainder in biological treatment plants, reducing the environmental effect of the waste waters below the level of scientific significance, except perhaps in very small streams. Even in the 21st century, some small kraft mills remained (producing at most a few tons of pulp per day) that discharged all black liquor.  However, these are rapidly disappearing. Some kraft mills, particularly in North America,{{citation needed|date=June 2009}} still recovered under 98% of the black liquor in 2007, which can cause some environmental contamination, even when biologically treated.  The general trend is for such obsolete mills to modernize or shut down.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Usage==
The black liquor contains more than half of the energy content of the wood fed into the [[Kraft process|digester]] of a kraft pulp mill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paperstudies.org/research/projects/gasification/background.htm The Center for Paper Business and Industry Studies (CPBIS)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is normally concentrated to 65 - 80% by multi-effect [[evaporator]]s and burned in a [[recovery boiler]] to produce energy and recover the cooking chemicals. The [[viscosity]] increases as the concentration goes up. At about 50 - 55% solids the salt solubility limit is reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fundamentals of the craft recovery process | last=Empie |first=H. Jeff |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2009|publisher=Tappi Press |location=USA |isbn=1-59510-186-1 |page=7 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tall oil]] is an important [[byproduct]] separated from the black liquor with [[Skimmer (machine)|skimming]] before it goes to the evaporators or after the first evaporator stage.

===Energy source for the pulp mill===
[[Pulp mill]]s have used black liquor as an energy source since at least the 1930s.&lt;ref name="wpost"/&gt;
Most kraft pulp mills use [[recovery boiler]]s to recover and burn much of the black liquor they produce, generating steam and recovering the cooking chemicals ([[sodium hydroxide]] and [[sodium sulfide]] used to separate lignin from the cellulose fibres needed for papermaking). This has helped paper mills reduce problems with water emissions, reduce their use of chemicals by recovery and reuse, and become nearly energy self-sufficient by producing, on average, 66 percent of their own electricity needs on-site.

In the United States, paper companies have consumed nearly all of the black liquor they produce since the 1990s.&lt;ref name="wpost"&gt;{{cite news | title = Papermakers Dig Deep in Highway Bill To Hit Gold | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/27/AR2009032703116.html | publisher = [[The Washington Post]] | date = March 28, 2009 | accessdate=2009-06-03 | first=Steven | last=Mufson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the forest products industry has become one of the United States' leading generators of carbon-neutral renewable energy, producing approximately 28.5 terawatt hours of electricity annually.

===Use as biofuel feedstock===

====Gasification====
[[File:Svartlut 76.jpg|thumb|Black liquor as used for gasification]]
New [[waste-to-energy]] methods to recover and utilize the energy in the black liquor have been developed. The use of [[black liquor gasification]] has the potential to achieve higher overall [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] than the conventional recovery boiler, while generating an energy-rich [[syngas]] from the liquor. The syngas can be burnt in a [[gas turbine]] [[combined cycle]] to produce electricity (usually called ''BLGCC'' for Black Liquor Gasification Combined Cycle; similar to [[Integrated gasification combined cycle|IGCC]]) or converted through [[Catalysis|catalytic processes]] into chemicals or fuels such as [[methanol]], [[dimethyl ether]] (DME), or [[Fischer-Tropsch process|F-T]] diesel (usually called ''BLGMF'' for Black Liquor Gasification for Motor Fuels). This gasification technology is currently under operation in a 3 MW pilot plant at [[Chemrec|Chemrec’s]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemrec.se/ Chemrec] website&lt;/ref&gt; test facility in [[Piteå]], [[Sweden]]. The DME synthesis step will be added in 2011 in the "BioDME" project, supported by the [[European Commission]]'s [[Seventh Framework Programme]] (FP7) and the [[Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications (Sweden)|Swedish Energy Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodme.eu/index.html BioDME Project] website&lt;/ref&gt;

Used for biofuels production, the black liquor gasification route has been shown to have very high [[Energy conversion efficiency|conversion efficiency]] and [[greenhouse gas]] reduction potential.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu/uploads/media/WTW_Report_010307.pdf Well-to-Wheels analysis of future automotive fuels and powertrains in the European context] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304231419/http://ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu/uploads/media/WTW_Report_010307.pdf |date=2011-03-04 }}

====Hydrothermal liquefaction====
[[Hydrothermal liquefaction]] is suitable for converting black liquor to advanced biofuels due to the process' ability to handle high moisture inputs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kosinkova|first1=Jana|last2=Ramirez|first2=Jerome|last3=Nguyen|first3=Jenny|last4=Ristovski|first4=Zoran|last5=Brown|first5=Richard|last6=Lin|first6=Carol|last7=Rainey|first7=Thomas|title=Hydrothermal liquefaction of bagasse using ethanol and black liquor as solvents|journal=Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining|date=10 Sep 2015|volume=9|issue=6|page=630-638|doi=10.1002/bbb.1578|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bbb.1578/}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Extraction of lignin====
Where [[recovery boiler]] capacity is limited and a bottleneck in the [[pulp mill]] the [[lignin]] in the black liquor may be extraordinary and exported or used as fuel in the mill's [[lime kiln]], thereby often replacing fossil based fuel with biofuel.

==U.S. tax credit 2007–2010==
A tax credit created by the U.S. Congress in 2005 as part of the [[Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users|2005 Highway Bill]] to reward and support the use of liquid [[alternative fuel]] derived from hydrocarbons in the transportation sector was expanded in 2007 to include non-mobile uses of liquid alternative fuel derived from biomass.  This change meant that, in addition to fish processors, animal renderers and meat packers, kraft pulp producers became eligible for the tax credit as a result of their generation and use of black liquor to make energy.  For one large company ([[International Paper]]) this could amount to as much as $3.7 billion in benefits.&lt;ref name="wpost"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=73062&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1269301 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714135024/http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=73062&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1269301 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 14, 2012 |title=International Paper Provides Update on Alternative Fuel Credits |publisher=[[International Paper]] |date=March 24, 2009 |accessdate=2009-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Weyerhaeuser]] announced in May 2009 that it was also pursuing the tax credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/id/30580378/site/14081545/for/cnbc/ | title= Weyerhaeuser says applied to become qualified as alternative fuel mixer | publisher= [[CNBC]] | date= May 5, 2009 | accessdate=2009-06-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some{{Who|date=April 2013}} have criticized the paper industry's eligibility for the alternative fuel mix tax credit on the grounds that it is increasing fossil fuel use, the industry has countered that adding a fossil fuel is actually a requirement of the law and that, regardless, this does not result in a net increase in fossil fuel use since companies are merely replacing the existing fossil fuel they already mix with black liquor—natural gas—with one of the three fuels specified by the law: gasoline, kerosene or diesel. The bio-fuel credit for Black Liquor ended on January 1, 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9390">'''Blood plasma [[fractionation]]''' refers to the general processes of separating the various components of [[blood plasma]], which in turn is a component of blood obtained through [[blood fractionation]].

==Blood plasma==
[[Blood plasma]] is the liquid component of [[whole blood]], and makes up approximately 55% of the total blood volume.  It is composed primarily of water with small amounts of minerals, salts, ions, nutrients, and proteins in solution. In whole blood, [[red blood cells]], [[leukocytes]], and [[platelets]] are suspended within the plasma.

==Plasma proteins==
Plasma contains a large variety of proteins including [[serum albumin|albumin]], [[immunoglobulins]], and clotting proteins such as [[fibrinogen]].&lt;ref name= "Brod"&gt;Brodniewicz-Proba, T. 1991. "Human Plasma Fractionation and the Impact of New Technologies on the Use and Quality of Plasma-derived Products". Blood Reviews. Vol. 5. pp.245-257.&lt;/ref&gt;  Albumin constitutes about 60% of the total protein in plasma and is present at concentrations between 35 and 55&amp;nbsp;mg/mL.&lt;ref name="Shen"&gt;Shen, Y., Jacobs, J. M., et al.  2004. ''"Ultra-High-Efficiency Strong Cation Exchange LC/RPLC/MS/MS for High Dynamic Range Characterization of the Human Plasma Proteome"''. Anal Chem. Vol. 76. pp. 1134-1144.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the main contributor to [[osmotic pressure]] of the blood and it functions as a carrier molecule for molecules with low water [[solubility]] such as lipid-soluble [[hormone]]s, [[enzyme]]s, [[fatty acids]], metal ions, and pharmaceutical compounds.&lt;ref name ="Mate"&gt;Matejtschuk, P., Dash, C.H., and Gascoigne, E.W. 2000. "Production of human albumin solution: a continually developing colloid". British Journal of Anaesthesia.  Vol 85.  pp. 887-895.&lt;/ref&gt;  Albumin is structurally stable due to its seventeen [[disulfide bonds]] and unique in that it has the highest water solubility and the lowest [[isoelectric point|isoelectric point (pI)]] of the plasma proteins.  Due to the structural integrity of albumin it remains stable under conditions where most other proteins [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]].

==Plasma proteins for clinical use==
Many of the proteins in plasma have important therapeutic uses.&lt;ref name="Brod"/&gt;   Albumin is commonly used to replenish and maintain blood volume after [[traumatic injury]], during [[surgery]], and during [[plasma exchange]].&lt;ref name="Mate"/&gt;  Since albumin is the most abundant protein in the plasma its use may be the most well known, but many other proteins, although present in low concentrations, can have important clinical uses.&lt;ref name="Brod"/&gt;  See table below.&lt;ref name="Brod"/&gt;

==Plasma processing==
When the ultimate goal of plasma processing is a purified plasma component for [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] or [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]], the plasma component must be highly pure.  The first practical large-scale method of blood plasma fractionation was developed by [[Edwin J. Cohn]] during [[World War II]].  It is known as the [[Cohn process]] (or [[Cohn method]]). This process is also known as cold ethanol fractionation as it involves gradually increasing the [[concentration]] of [[ethanol]] in the [[solution]] at 5&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C and 3&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C.&lt;ref name= "Mate"/&gt;  The Cohn Process exploits differences in properties of the various plasma proteins, specifically, the high [[solubility]] and low [[isoelectric point|pI]] of albumin.  As the ethanol concentration is increased in stages from 0% to 40% the [pH] is lowered from neutral (pH ~ 7) to about 4.8, which is near the pI of albumin.&lt;ref name="Mate"/&gt;  At each stage certain proteins are [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitated out]] of the solution and removed.  The final [[precipitate]] is purified albumin.  Several variations to this process exist, including an adapted method by Nitschmann and Kistler that uses less steps, and replaces [[centrifugation]] and bulk freezing with [[filtration]] and diafiltration.&lt;ref name="Brod"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mate"/&gt;

Some newer methods of albumin purification add additional purification steps to the Cohn Process and its variations, while others incorporate [[chromatography]], with some methods being purely chromatographic.&lt;ref name="Mate"/&gt;  Chromatographic albumin processing as an alternative to the Cohn Process emerged in the early 1980s, however, it was not widely adopted until later due to the inadequate availability of large scale chromatography equipment.&lt;ref name= "Mate"/&gt;  Methods incorporating chromatography generally begin with cryodepleted plasma undergoing buffer exchange via either diafiltration or buffer exchange chromatography, to prepare the plasma for following [[ion exchange chromatography]] steps.&lt;ref name="Mate"/&gt;  After ion exchange there are generally further chromatographic purification steps and buffer exchange.&lt;ref name="Mate"/&gt;

''For further information see [[chromatography in blood processing]].''

==Plasma for analytical uses==
In addition to the clinical uses of a variety of plasma proteins, plasma has many analytical uses.  Plasma contains many [[biomarkers]] that can play a role in [[medical diagnosis|clinical diagnosis]] of [[diseases]], and separation of plasma is a necessary step in the expansion of the human plasma [[proteome]].

===Plasma in clinical diagnosis===
Plasma contains an abundance of proteins many of which can be used as biomarkers, indicating the presence of certain diseases in an individual.  Currently, [[Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis|2D Electrophoresis]] is the primary method for discovery and detection of biomarkers in plasma.  This involves the separation of plasma proteins on a gel by exploiting differences in their size and [[isoelectric point|pI]].    Potential disease biomarkers may be present in plasma at very low concentrations, so, plasma samples must undergo preparation procedures for accurate results to be obtained using 2D Electrophoresis.  These preparation procedures aim to remove contaminants that may interfere with detection of biomarkers, solubilize the proteins so they are able to undergo [[Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis|2D Electrophoresis]] analysis, and prepare plasma with minimal loss of low concentration proteins, but optimal removal of high abundance proteins.

The future of laboratory diagnostics are headed toward [[lab-on-a-chip]] technology, which will bring the laboratory to the [[point-of-care testing|point-of-care]].  This involves integration of all of the steps in the analytical process, from the initial removal of plasma from whole blood to the final analytical result, on a small [[microfluidics|microfluidic device]].  This is advantageous because it reduces turn around time, allows for the control of variables by [[automation]], and removes the labor-intensive and sample wasting steps in current diagnostic processes.

===Expansion of the human plasma proteome===
The human plasma proteome may contain thousands of proteins, however, identifying them presents challenges due to the wide range of concentrations present.  Some low abundance proteins may be present in [[picogram]] (pg/mL) quantities, while high abundance proteins can be present in [[milligram]] (mg/mL) quantities.  Many efforts to expand the human plasma proteome overcome this difficulty by coupling some type of [[high performance liquid chromatography| high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)]] or [[reverse phase chromatography|reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC)]] with high efficiency [[ion exchange chromatography|cation exchange chromatography]] and subsequent tandem [[mass spectrometry]] for protein identification.&lt;ref name="Shen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wu"&gt;Wu, S., Choudhary, G., et al. 2003. ""Evaluation of Shotgun Sequencing for Proteomic Analysis of Human Plasma Using HPLC coupled with Either Ion Trap or Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry"". Journal of Proteome Research. Vol. 2. pp. 383-393.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[electronics]], a  '''bootstrap'''  circuit is one where part of the output of an amplifier stage is applied to the input, so as to alter the input [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the amplifier. When applied deliberately, the intention is usually to increase rather than decrease the impedance.  &lt;ref&gt; ''IEEE Standard 100  Authoritative Dictionary of IEEE Standards Terms, Seventh Edition'', IEEE Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0-7381-2601-2}} page 123 &lt;/ref&gt; Generally, any technique where part of the output of a system is used at startup is described as bootstrapping. 

In the domain of [[MOSFET]] circuits, "bootstrapping" is commonly used to mean pulling up the [[operating point]] of a transistor above the power supply rail.&lt;ref name="Uyemura1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=John P. Uyemura|title=CMOS Logic Circuit Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udv--YBwA7sC&amp;pg=PA319|year=1999|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-7923-8452-6|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pelgrom2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcel J.M.

==Input impedance==
[[File:Emitter follower.png|thumb|400px|Bootstrap capacitors C1 and C2 in a BJT emitter follower circuit]]
In [[analog circuit]] designs, a bootstrap circuit is an arrangement of components deliberately intended to alter the [[input impedance]] of a circuit. Usually it is intended to increase the impedance,  by using a small amount of positive [[feedback]], usually over two stages. This was often necessary in the early days of [[bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] [[transistor]]s, which inherently have quite a low input impedance. Because the feedback is positive, such circuits can suffer from poor stability and noise performance compared to ones that don't bootstrap.

''Negative'' feedback may alternatively be used to bootstrap an input impedance, causing the apparent impedance to be reduced. This is seldom done deliberately, however, and is normally an unwanted result of a particular circuit design. A well-known example of this is the [[Miller effect]], in which an unavoidable feedback capacitance appears increased (i.e. its impedance appears reduced) by negative feedback.  One popular case where this ''is'' done deliberately is the [[Frequency compensation#Dominant-pole compensation|Miller compensation]] technique for providing a low-frequency pole inside an integrated circuit.  To minimize the size of the necessary capacitor, it is placed between the input and an output which swings in the opposite direction.  This bootstrapping makes it act like a larger capacitor to ground.

==Driving MOS transistors==
A N-[[MOSFET]]/[[Insulated-gate bipolar transistor|IGBT]] needs a significantly positive charge (''V&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; V''&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;) applied to the gate in order to turn on. Using only N-channel MOSFET/IGBT devices is a common cost reduction method due largely to [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] size reduction&lt;!-- Source needed citing cost reduction from use of nMOS over pMOS devices. --&gt; (there are other benefits as well). However, using nMOS devices in place of pMOS devices means that a voltage higher than the power rail supply (V+) is needed in order to bias the transistor into linear operation (minimal current limiting) and thus avoid significant heat loss.

A bootstrap capacitor is connected from the supply rail (V+) to the output voltage. Usually the source terminal of the N-[[MOSFET]] is connected to the [[cathode]] of a recirculation [[diode]] allowing for efficient management of stored energy in the typically inductive load (See [[Flyback diode]]). Due to the charge storage characteristics of a capacitor, the bootstrap voltage will rise above (V+) providing the needed gate drive voltage.

A [[MOSFET]]/[[IGBT]] is a voltage-controlled device which, in theory, will not have any gate current. This makes it possible to utilize the charge inside the capacitor for control purposes. However, eventually the capacitor will lose its charge due to parasitic gate current and non-ideal (i.e. finite) internal resistance, so this scheme is only used where there is a steady pulse present. This is because the pulsing action allows for the capacitor to discharge (at least partially if not completely). Most control schemes that use a bootstrap capacitor force the high side driver (N-MOSFET) off for a minimum time to allow for the capacitor to refill. This means that the [[duty cycle]] will always need to be less than 100% to accommodate for the parasitic discharge unless the leakage is accommodated for in another manner.

==Switch-mode power supplies==
In [[switch mode power supplies|switch-mode power supplies]], the regulation circuits are powered from the output. To start the power supply, a leakage resistance can be used to trickle-charge the supply rail for the control circuit to start it oscillating. This approach is less costly and more efficient than providing a separate linear power supply just to start the regulator circuit. &lt;ref&gt;Raymond A. Mack ''Demystifying switching power supplies'' Newnes, 2005 {{ISBN|0-7506-7445-8}},  page 121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Output swing==
AC amplifiers can use bootstrapping to increase output swing.  A capacitor (usually referred as ''bootstrap capacitor'') is connected from the output of the amplifier to the [[bias circuit]], providing bias voltages that exceed the power supply voltage.  Emitter followers can provide rail-to-rail output in this way, which is a common technique in class AB audio amplifiers.&lt;br /&gt;

==Digital integrated circuits==
Within an integrated circuit a bootstrap method is used to allow internal address and clock distribution lines to have an increased voltage swing.  The bootstrap circuit uses a coupling capacitor, formed from the gate/source capacitance of a transistor, to drive a signal line to slightly greater than the supply voltage. &lt;ref&gt; William J. Dally, John W. Poulton, ''Digital systems engineering'', Cambridge University Press, 1998 {{ISBN|0-521-59292-5}} pages 190-191 &lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
BASEC has been testing and certifying [[electrical cable]]s for over forty years.&lt;ref name="qa-register"&gt;[http://www.quality-register.co.uk/bodies/body47.htm Accredited Bodies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619133620/http://www.quality-register.co.uk/bodies/body47.htm |date=June 19, 2013 }} QA Register. Retrieved 14 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was formed in 1971 by a number of leading industry bodies, including [[BSI Group|BSI]], BCA, The Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE), and [[Electrical Contractors' Association|The Electrical Contractors Association]] (ECA), a group which has now been joined by [[National Inspection Council for Electrical Installation Contracting|The National Inspection Council for Electrical Installation Contracting]] (NICEIC).&lt;ref name="lab-voltimum" /&gt; By detailed examination of manufacturers' production [[Process capability|processes]] and controls, and rigorous testing, BASEC ensures that products meet appropriate British, European and International [[Technical standard|standards]]. The organization has grown to be a modern, accessible body servicing and representing its many client manufactures.&lt;ref name="guide-basec" /&gt;

The organization's Board and Certification Committee provides [[Supervisory board|independent governance]]. BASEC is [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government-nominated]] and accredited by [[United Kingdom Accreditation Service|UKAS]], demonstrating competence, impartiality and reliability in its ability to deliver results.&lt;ref name="ukas"&gt;[https://archive.is/20141014093732/http://www.ukas.com/CertificationBodiesSearch.asp?qt=basec&amp;postcode= Accredited Certification Body] UKAS.

Retrieved 14 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product certification ==
BASEC's main approval service is [[Product certification|Product Certification]] which applies to individual cable types. All products are rigorously tested to meet necessary and appropriate [[BSI Group#Standards|standards]] through detailed examination of manufacturers production [[Process (engineering)|processes]] and controls.&lt;ref name="guide-basec" /&gt; Product samples are retrieved from the client manufactures on which BASEC then carries out tests at its accredited [[Laboratory|laboratories]] in Milton Keynes.&lt;ref name="basec-role-voltimum"&gt;[http://www.voltimum.co.uk/articles/role-basec-assessor Role of the BASEC Assessor] Voltimum. Retrieved 14 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; BASEC also verifies that products fully comply with the relevant specification by full type testing at independent laboratories or by witnessing tests at the client [[factory]]. Manufacturers may apply for a license to display the [[Certification mark|BASEC mark]] on their products only when BASEC is satisfied that their [[Manufacturing|manufacturing systems]] are capable of consistently producing cable products. After having attained a BASEC Product Marking License they are subjected to regular factory [[audit]]s and [[Product certification#Certification process|products surveillance testing]].&lt;ref name="guide-basec" /&gt; BASEC issues [[Product certification#Certification marks and listings of certified products|certificates]] to unique, specific products when they have passed thorough testing and the manufacturer can demonstrate ongoing [[CE marking#Declaration of conformity|conformity]].&lt;ref name="voltimum" /&gt;

Cables are tested against the requirements of the relevant [[BSI Group#Standards|standards]] for characteristics such as:&lt;ref name="voltimum" /&gt; 
* Electrical and/or data signal breakdown
* Flexing, [[Abrasion (mechanical)#Abrasion resistance|abrasion resistance]] and impact performance
* Stretching characteristics of the insulating material
* Operational properties at high and low temperatures
* Cable construction and dimensions within defined tolerances
* [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|Conductivity]]

The organization has extended its [[United Kingdom Accreditation Service]] (UKAS) accreditation to include [[ISO/IEC 17025]].&lt;ref name="ukas-lab"&gt;[http://www.ukas.org/testing/schedules/actual/5950Testing%20Single.pdf Accredited Testing Lab] UKAS. Retrieved 15 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management System certification ==
Most [[List of biggest cable manufacturers|cable manufacturers]], distributors and service providers now operate with formalised [[management system]]s. These give customers a degree of reassurance that the organization has procedures and processes in place that will assist in the delivery of a product, process or service that conforms to expectations, and that if things go wrong then the organization will respond appropriately.&lt;ref name="basec-certification-page"&gt;[https://www.basec.org.uk/certification/management-systems-certification Quality Management and Product Certification] BASEC. 08 October 2010. Retrieved 20 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; BASEC provides management system [[certification]] to [[List of biggest cable manufacturers|cable manufacturers]] and other organizations involved within the cables sector. Assessment may be to an individual [[Technical standard|standard]] or to two or more in an integrated manner, such as:&lt;ref name="guide-basec" /&gt;

* [[Quality management|Quality management systems]] to [[ISO 9000|ISO 9001]]&lt;ref name="qms"&gt;[https://www.basec.org.uk/certification/management-systems-certification Scheme for the Certification of Quality Management Systems] BASEC. Retrieved 06 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

BASEC's own approach to management system [[certification]] is tailored specifically to cable making. It is designed to assess an organizations ability to produce goods and services consistently to specification and customer requirements in a safe manner with due regard to the environment.&lt;ref name="guide-basec" /&gt; BASEC is [[Accreditation|accredited]] by [[United Kingdom Accreditation Service|UKAS]] against ISO/IEC 17021 for QMS certification and for EMS certification.&lt;ref name="ukas" /&gt;

== Construction Products Regulation (CPR) ==
As of 1 July 2017 under the European [https://www.basec.org.uk/testing/construction-products-regulation-tests/ Construction Products Regulation (CPR)], it is now mandatory for cable manufacturers and suppliers to apply CE marking to any products covered by the harmonised European standard EN 50575. The CPR applies to all cables placed on the market for use in fixed installation in domestic, commercial and industrial premises and other civil engineering works anywhere in the European Union. It applies to power, communications and fibre optic cables irrespective of the place of manufacture.
These tests with a few exceptions need to be carried out by an independent [[Notified Body]]. BASEC is designated Notified Body No. 2662 for the CPR System 1+ and System 3.

BASEC has the fire test equipment to undertake the following tests:
* Heat of combustion EN ISO 1716
* Heat release and smoke production EN 50399
* Vertical flame propagation EN 60332-1-2
* Smoke density EN 61034-2
* Acidity / acid gas content EN 60754-2

== The BASEC mark ==
The BASEC mark found upon approved cable products is a recognized sign of assurance of [[Independent test organization|independent cable testing]] and approval.&lt;ref name="voltimum-pdf"&gt;[http://www.voltimum.co.uk/files/gb/others/4/200410258504basec.pdf When cable has to be safe it has to be BASEC] Voltimum. Retrieved 21 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers may apply for a license to display the BASEC [[Certification mark|mark]] on their products only when BASEC is satisfied that their manufacturing systems are [[Process capability|capable]] of consistently producing safe cable products, through assessment to the BASEC [[Product certification|Product Certification Requirements]].&lt;ref name="guide-basec" /&gt; Manufacturers also have the option of displaying the BASEC name or [[roundel]] on [[Cable reel|reels and drums]]. BASEC approved manufacturers recognize quality and [[Safety standards|safety]] and this should be seen as a sign of assurance for contractors, customers and wholesalers.&lt;ref name="basec-mark-and-logo"&gt;[http://basec.org.uk/About-BASEC/BASEC-Mark-and-Logo BASEC Mark and Logo] BASEC. Retrieved 21 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cable [[Technical standard|standards]] not only specify the dimensions and materials of a cable, they also require that a range of specific [[Product testing|tests]] are undertaken to prove the construction and performance.&lt;ref name="basec-right-cable"&gt;[http://www.basec.org.uk/News/Basec-News/Choosing-the-Right-Cable-for-the-Environment Choosing the Right Cable for the Environment] BASEC. 06 September 2010. Retrieved 21 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many non-approved cables have not been subject to the required tests. It is a common misunderstanding that a cable is [[Product certification|compliant with standards]] or even BASEC approved just because the supplier claims that it has been produced to a particular [[Technical standard|standard]]. Cable marked with only a standard number should be treated with caution, it is probable that nobody [[Independent test organization|independent]] of the manufacturer has examined that cable, and the claims made may be unreliable.&lt;ref name="aci-safe-cable"&gt;[http://www.aci.org.uk/forum.asp Approved Cables] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620033641/http://www.aci.org.uk/forum.asp |date=June 20, 2014 }} ACI.

== Investigation, testing and advice ==
Upon the occurrence of a concern, problem or dispute in relation to use of cables, for example in the case of failure or performance problems, BASEC can conduct an [[Independent test organization|independent investigation]] into performance or compliance to a specification. This may include testing and the assessment of [[Specification (technical standard)|specifications]]. BASEC will use appropriate experts, and commission tailored examination and testing programs from suitable [[Laboratory|laboratories]], to address the problem.&lt;ref name="guide-basec" /&gt; The organization will advise on the cases of the problem and provide assistance with the selection of specifications. As an official [[Notified Body]] under the [[Low Voltage Directive|European Low Voltage Directive]], BASEC can perform assessments and prepare [[technical report]]s for manufacturers and importers of cable products. BASEC is also able to provide expert witness services in cases of [[Legal case|legal dispute]].&lt;ref name="basec-investigation"&gt;[http://www.basec.org.uk/About-BASEC/BASEC-Services/Investigations Investigations] BASEC.

'''Chintz'''  (from the plural of '''chint''') was originally glazed [[Calico (fabric)|calico]] textiles, initially specifically those imported from India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Chintz |volume=6 |page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;(derived from chhint-a hindi word) printed with designs featuring flowers and other patterns in different colours, typically on a light plain background.  Since the 19th century the term has also been used for the style of floral decoration developed in those calico textiles, but then used more widely, for example on [[chintzware]] pottery and [[wallpaper]]. Chintz designs are mostly European patterns loosely derived from the style of Indian designs themselves reflecting, via [[Mughal art]], decorative traditions in [[Islamic art]] such as the [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]], and especially the [[Safavid art]] of Persia.  

Unglazed [[calico (fabric)|calico]] was traditionally called "[[cretonne]]".  The word ''calico'' is derived from the name of the Indian city [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (Kozhikkode in native [[Malayalam]]) to which it had a manufacturing association. In contemporary language the word "chintz" and "chintzy" can be used to refer to clothing or furnishings which are vulgar or [[wikt:florid|florid]] in appearance, and commonly in informal speech, to refer to cheap, low quality, or gaudy things, including personal behavior.

==History==
Chintz was originally a [[woodblock printing|woodblock printed]], painted or stained calico produced in [[India]] from 1600 to 1800 and popular for [[Bedding|bed covers]], [[quilts]] and [[drapery|draperies]]. Around 1600, Portuguese and Dutch traders were bringing examples of Indian chintz into [[Europe]] on a small scale, but the English and French merchants began sending large quantities.  By 1680 more than a million pieces of chintz were being imported into England per year, and a similar quantity was going to France and the Dutch Republic. These early imports were probably mostly used for curtains, furnishing fabrics, and bed hangings and covers ([[Samuel Pepys]] bought a set for his wife).  It has been suggested that wearing them as clothes began when these were replaced and given to maidservants, who made them into dresses, and also that they were first worn as linings.  

With imported chintz becoming so popular with Europeans during the late 17th century, French and English mills grew concerned, as they could not make chintz.  In 1686 the French declared a ban on all chintz imports. In 1720 England's Parliament enacted a law that forbade "the Use and Warings in Apparel of imported chintz, and also its use or Wear in or about any Bed, Chair, Cushion or other Household furniture".

Even though chintz was outlawed, there were loopholes in the legislation. The Court of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] was outside the law and fashionable young courtiers continued wearing chintz. In 1734, French naval officer, M. de Beaulieu, who was stationed at [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], India, sent home letters along with actual samples of chintz fabric during each stage of the process to a chemist friend detailing the dyeing process of cotton chintz. His letters and samples can be seen today in the [[Muséum national d'histoire naturelle|Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle]] in [[Paris]].

In 1742, another Frenchman, Father Coeurdoux also supplied details of the chintz making process, while he was trying to convert the Indians to [[Catholicism]]. In 1759 the ban against chintz was lifted.  By this time French and English mills were able to produce chintz.

Europeans at first produced reproductions of Indian designs, and later added original patterns. A well-known make was ''[[Jouy-en-Josas#History|toile de Jouy]]'', which was manufactured in [[Jouy-en-Josas|Jouy]], [[France]], between 1700 and 1843.  Modern chintz usually consists of bright overall floral patterns printed on a light background but there are some popular patterns on black backgrounds as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30076">'''Computer Braille''' is an adaptation of [[braille]] for precise representation of computer-related materials such as programs, program lines, computer commands, and filenames. Unlike standard 6-dot braille scripts, but like [[Gardner–Salinas braille codes]], this may employ the extended 8-dot braille patterns. The resulting 256 braille characters are assigned to the 256 characters of 8-bit computer encodings.

There are two standards of representation of computer code with braille:

1) The '''Computer Braille Code''' as defined by the [[Braille Authority of North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Computer Braille Code: 2000 Revision|date=2000|publisher=Braille Authority of North America|url=http://www.brailleauthority.org/cbc/cbc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since January 2016 it is no longer official in the USA and replaced by [[Unified English Braille]] (UEB). It employs only the 6-dot braille patterns to represent all code points of [[ASCII]] as well as many technical characters and commands. It is virtually identical to the [[Braille ASCII]], a system of representation of braille with ASCII characters, which goal is mirrored to the Computer Braille Code. To represent ASCII code points 0x60, 0x7B, 0x7C, 0x7D, 0x7E as well as capital letters the 4-5-6 ({{braille cell|456}}) character is used as the shift indicator or modifier. Thus, {{code|`}} (grave accent, 0x60) is represented by {{braille cell|456}}{{braille cell|4}}, where {{braille cell|4}} is assigned to {{code|@}} (at sign, 0x40). In other words, {{braille cell|456}} either adds (for punctuation) or subtracts (for letters) 32 to or from the ASCII value of the following character. Unlike Braille ASCII {{code|_}} (underscore, 0x5F) is represented by {{braille cell|456}}{{braille cell|456}}.

2) The '''Braille Computer Notation''' as defined by the [[Braille Authority of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Braille Computer Notation|date=2006|publisher=Braille Authority of the United Kingdom (Computer Committee)|url=http://www.ukaaf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Braille-Computer-Notation-PDF.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this notation both 6- and 8-dot patterns may be used. With the 6-dot code various combinations of braille characters can represent many technical, mathematical and logical symbols. The {{braille cell|5}} {{code|dot 5}} character is used as a universal modifier. The 8-dot code is designed that its 6-dot subset is identical to the 6-dot code. The remainder are assigned by the following rules:

:* adding dot 7 subtracts 32 from the ASCII value; 
:* adding dot 8 adds 128 to the ASCII value;
:* adding dots 7 and 8 adds 96 to the ASCII value.

A '''custom home''' is a one-of-a-kind house that is designed for a specific client and for a particular location. The custom home builder may use plans created by an [[architect]] or by a professional [[home designer]]. Custom homes afford [[consumer]]s the opportunity to control layout, lot size, and accessibility.

In most cases, custom home builders construct on land the [[home buyer]] already owns. Some developers sell fully serviced lots specifically for the construction of custom homes. This makes it easy to build a custom home since the lot is construction-ready and [[Construction worker|builders]] can focus purely on the design of the home.

==Differences between custom home builders and production home builders==
===Custom home builders===

*Build on land already owned. Some custom builders also build on land they own which is known as a spec home – short for speculative.
*Build unique houses. A custom home is a site-specific home built from a unique set of plans for the wishes of a specific client. For this the services of an [[architect]] are used.  Some custom builders may offer design/build services.
*Build [[single-family home]]s.
*Are generally small-volume builders.
*Tend to build [[high-end]] homes.

===Production home builders===
*Build on land they own.
*Tend to use stock plans, but usually offer a variety of plan choices, upgrades and options.
*Build all types of housing — single-family, [[Condominium|condos]], [[town house]]s, and [[rental]] properties.
*Are large-volume builders.
*Generally build for all [[price point]]s.

==Industry==
===Australia===
The Construction Industry attributes to being the fourth largest contributor to GDP in Australian economy, employing 9.1% of the Australian workforce.&lt;ref name="Australian Construction Industry"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1350.0Feature+Article1Oct+2010|title= Australian Construction Industry|publisher=abs.gov.au |accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.K.===
Despite the economic recovery, house building is rapidly increasing. Housing construction grew for a 15th month in April, which is the longest period of growth 2006/07.&lt;ref name="UK Home Construction Industry"&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/02/uk-home-construction-property-boom-house-building |title= UK Home Construction Industry|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, the home building industry accounts for $82 billion in revenue with an annual growth of 5.8%. The industry currently attributes to 398,391 employees over 163,843 Businesses.&lt;ref name="Home Builders in the U.S"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/default.aspx?indid=169|title=Home Builders in the U.S|publisher=IBISWorld|accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cut-off factor''' (AKA "'''cut-off length'''") is a [[coefficient|factor]]  used to calculate the [[length]] of a [[Hose (tubing)|hose]] [[cutting|cut]] to achieve the desired overall length of [[Hose (tubing)|hose]] plus [[Piping and plumbing fittings|fittings]]. It is commonly seen in [[hydraulic]] hose and fitting specifications. The cut-off factor is specific to a particular hose fitting.

The [[formula]] used in calculating the optimum overall length is:

&lt;math&gt;Cut\ Hose\ Length\ = Hose\ Assembly\ Overall\ Length - C1 - C2&lt;/math&gt;.

In this formula, C1 represents the cut-off factor of the first hose end and C2 represents the cut-off factor of the second hose end.

In a [[Drilling rig (petroleum)|drilling rig]], the '''drill line''' is a multi-thread, twisted '''''wire''''' rope that is threaded or [http://en.wiktionary.com/wiki/reeve reeved] through the [[traveling block]] and [[crown block]] to facilitate the lowering and lifting of the [[drill string]] into and out of the [[wellbore]].

On larger diameter lines, traveling block loads of over a ''million'' pounds are possible.

To '''make a connection''' is to add another segment of [[drill pipe]] onto the top the [[drill string]]. A segment is added by pulling the [[kelly drive|kelly]] above the rotary table, stopping the mud pump, hanging off the drill string in the rotary table, unscrewing the kelly from the drill pipe below, swinging the kelly over to permit connecting it to the top of the new segment (which had been placed in the [[Mousehole_(drilling)|mousehole]]), and then screwing this assembly into the top of the existing drill string. Mud circulation is resumed, and the drill string is lowered into the hole until the bit takes weight at the bottom of the hole.  Drilling then resumes.

An '''electric eye''' is a [[photodetector]] used for detecting obstruction of a light beam. An example is the [[Door#Door-related accidents|door safety]] system used on [[garage door opener]]s that use a light transmitter and receiver at the bottom of the door to prevent closing if there is any obstruction in the way that breaks the light beam. The device does not provide an image; only presence of light is detectable. Visible light may be used, but [[infrared]] radiation conceals the operation of the device and typically is used in modern systems. Originally, systems used lamps powered by [[direct current]] or the power line [[alternating current]] frequency, but modern photodetector systems use an infrared [[LED|light-emitting diode]] modulated at a few kilohertz, which allows the detector to reject stray light and improves the range, sensitivity and security of the device.

==Examples==
'''Highway vehicle counter'''
* In the 1930s, an electric eye vehicle counter was introduced in the US using two IR lamps set apart so that only cars and not pedestrians would be counted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dyYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Popular+Science+motor+gun+boat&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NinuTNraIJ2KnAexu8T4Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Autos Are Counted By Electric Eye", January 1937, Popular Science]&lt;/ref&gt;
'''First compact commercial unit'''
* A compact type of electric eye was offered in 1931 that was enclosed in a small steel case and much easier to install compared to older models.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=u-IDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA398&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+1931+curtiss&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2kTvTOz_A6HfnQfR0_C7Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Electric Eye And Relay Set Combined In Cabinet", March 1931, Popular Mechanics]&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Automatic wrapping machines'''

'''Flowtite Technology AS''' is a Norwegian technology company, owned by Amiantit Group. It develops GRP pipe manufacturing technology and designs tailor-made manufacturing equipment under the brand name ''Flowtite''. Its predecessor, Vera Fabrikker, was the first company in the world to utilize a [[continuous filament winding machine]] for production of glassfibre-reinforced plastic pipes ([[Fiberglass|GRP pipes]]) and to invent the corresponding manufacturing process, commonly known as [[Filament winding|continuous filament winding process]]&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;Black, Sandra “Designing for high pressure: Large-diameter underground pipe”, ''Composites Technology'' 31 May 2012 [http://www.compositesworld.com/articles/making-continuous-composite-pipes http://www.compositesworld.com/articles/making-continuous-composite-pipes ](retrieved on 08.02.2016)&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Filament winding|Drostholm process]].

== History ==
The history of Flowtite Technology can be traced back to 1929 when the owners of [[Jotun (company)|Jotun]] established a manufacturing plant for vegetable oils, called Vera Fabrikker, in [[Sandefjord]], [[Norway]]. In May 1966 engineers from Vera Fabrikker met with Frede Hilmar Drostholm at an exhibition in Copenhagen, Denmark. The company Drostholm Ltd presented a prototype of a continuous winding machine for production of GRP pipes — an invention of Drostholm’s partner, Peder Ulrik Poulsen.&lt;ref&gt;Poulsen, Peder Ulrik "Working procedure of and apparatus for the manufacture of reinforced plastic tubes" U.S. Patent No. 3,431,158. Mar. 4, 1969. Retrieved from https://www.google.com/patents/US3431158 (on 08.02.2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Vera Fabrikker purchased this machine with a goal to develop a process enabling the machine to produce GRP pipes and tank shells.&lt;ref name="Black" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbu A., Method for producing tubes of reinforced setting plastic material, US3770541 A, 06.11.1973, Retrieved from [http://www.google.is/patents/US3770541 http://www.google.is/patents/US3770541 ]&lt;/ref&gt; After a year of unsuccessful experimenting, a second invention was made — a steel band was added to the machine&lt;ref&gt;Poulsen, P.U. "Driven mandrel rotatable about its longitudinal axis for continuous production of tubing in running lengths, preferably glass fibre reinforced plastic tubing." U.S. Patent No. 3,464,879. 2 Sep. 1969.Retrieved from http://www.google.com/patents/US3431158 (on 08.02.2016)&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1968 Vera Fabrikker started producing GRP pipes and tanks. In 1971 the GRP technology was bought by [[Owens Corning]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;Tollnes, Ivar “Agnar Gilbu, fra baker til verdensborger”. ''Sandefjord Blad'', June 1, 1996, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, in 1977, [[Owens Corning]] together with [[Jotun (company)|Jotun]] established a new company — Veroc Technology AS (the last two letters in Veroc stand for Owens Corning&lt;ref name="Bygstad"&gt;Bygstad, Kjell “Sandefjord-bedrift over i amerikansk eie: Fra Vera til Owens-Corning”, ''Fabrikk Arbeideren'' Nr7-1994, Aktietrykkeriet – Oslo, pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;). It was responsible for the development of GRP pipes and tanks, as well as manufacturing and installing production equipment for the licensed GRP pipe producers all over the world. In 1993 Owens Corning took over Veroc Technology 100%.&lt;ref name="Bygstad" /&gt; Later, in 1998, the company name was changed to Flowtite Technology AS, as it is known today.&lt;ref name="Nygaard"&gt;Nygaard, Paal Even “ Owens Corning skifter navn til Flowtite AS”, ''Sandefjord Blad'' 4.04.1998&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 Flowtite Technology AS was acquired by the Saudi Arabian Amiantit Company (Amiantit Group) and became its main technology centre in 2006.

== Brand History ==
The brand Flowtite and its logo was created in the 1970s by [[Owens Corning]], when the company produced GRP pipes under the trademark Flowtite.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Derick “Advanced Materials for Water Handling: Composites and Thermoplastics” Elsevier Science Inc, 18. aug. 2000, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Owens-Corning case history “Fiberglas Flowtite pipe used for 3700-ft. Texas sewer line” Pub. No. 5-PS-6489 Litho in U.S.A., May 1974&lt;/ref&gt; The trademark was first registered in the USA in 1975, then progressively across the world.&lt;ref name="Nygaard" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WIPO Global Brand Database, No 73023895 retrieved from http://www.wipo.int/branddb/en/ (on 08.02.2016)&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed of the words “flow” and “tite” (a dialect version of “tight”&lt;ref&gt;Wright J. “The English dialect dictionary” Volume VI. T-Z. Henry Frowde Oxford, London, Edinburgh, New York, Toronto 1905&lt;/ref&gt;) and represents a steady movement of liquids through a compact and sealed medium. Two circles of the Flowtite logotype symbolize a pipe containing water flow.

== Flowtite Manufacturing Process ==
Flowtite pipes can only be produced with a custom-designed production equipment, which has a basic [[Continuous filament winding machine|filament winding machine]] as a basis. It consists of a continuous steel band mandrel, supported by beams installed circumferentially to form a cylindrical shape. The mandrel moves continuously in a spiral path towards the exit assembly. As the mandrel rotates, all composite materials are metered onto it in precise amounts, forming one layer after another. As a pipe is being formed on the mandrel, it moves forward to the curing and cutting areas and the finished product comes out at the end of one continuous production process.&lt;ref&gt;Flowtite Pipe Systems. Technocal characteristics, p.3 retrieved from http://www.flowtite.com/brochures/FT_TechCharacter_27.12.2011_V5_ENG-new%20final-WS_HIDD.pdf (on 08.02.2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Как делают стеклопластиковые трубы”, Obozrevatel, 06 may 2015 http://obozrevatel.com/blogs/96748-kak-delayut-stekloplastikovyie-trubyi.htm (retrieved 08 February 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Flowtite GRP pipes are used in various industries and multiple applications, such as:
* Water transmission and distribution (potable and raw water)
* Water storage and overflow systems
* Sewerage
* Hydropower
* Irrigation
* Industrial application
* Chemical sewage treatment
* Desalination
* Pulp &amp; Paper
* Mining
* Marine, shipbuilding and offshore rigs

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2176">'''Goma-2 Eco''' was a type of [[high explosive]] manufactured for industrial use (chiefly [[mining]]) by [[Unión Española de Explosivos]] S.A.

It was a gelatinous, [[nitroglycol]]-based explosive widely used within Spain and exported abroad.
It was used by [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] in the 1980s and 1990s.

There were two variants of Goma-2: Goma-2 EC and Goma-2 ECO.  As of 2017, the manufacturer MAXAM Corp. S. L. has reformulated the Goma-type ammonia gelatine dynamites which are marketed worldwide under the new Riodin trade name.

==Properties==
Goma-2 explosive was a mixture of several chemicals:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061011063431/http://www.nordspreng.no/dokumenter/datablad/HMS-datablad,norskversjon_Goma2ECO_.pdf Safety data sheet for Goma-2 ECO by Nordspreng]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ammonium nitrate]] - 60—70%
*[[Ethylene glycol dinitrate|Nitroglycol]] - 26—34%
*[[Nitrocellulose]] - 0.5—2%
*[[Dibutyl phthalate]] - 1—3%
*[[Fuel]]s - 1—3%

As with other commercial blasting explosives, detonators were needed to initiate a detonation (usually a [[blasting cap]] # 8).

==Terrorist use==
Goma-2 ECO was the explosive that was used in the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]]. Terrorist Jamal Ahmidan, also known as El Chino, bought the explosive illegally from a mine in northern Spain. It was also planned by the same cell that carried out the Madrid bombings to use the explosive to derail a high-speed train. About 80 kilograms of the explosive was used by [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] in [[Operación Ogro|Operation Ogro]] to assassinate [[Luis Carrero Blanco]]. The explosion was so powerful it threw Blanco's car over a five story building.

{{EnigmaSeries}}
The '''grill method''' ({{lang-pl|metoda rusztu}}),&lt;ref&gt;Marian Rejewski, Mathematical Solution of the Enigma Cipher, trans Christopher Kasparek, Cryptologia, Vol 6, Number 1, pp 1–18 at 17, January 1982&lt;/ref&gt; in [[cryptology]], was a method used chiefly early on, before the advent of the [[cyclometer]], by the mathematician-cryptologists of the Polish Cipher Bureau (''[[Biuro Szyfrów]]'') in [[decryption|decrypting]] German [[Enigma machine]] [[cipher]]s.&lt;ref name = RejewskiKozaczuk290&gt;{{Harvnb|Rejewski|1984e|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Enigma [[Rotor machine|rotor cipher machine]] changes [[plaintext]] characters into [[Ciphertext|cipher text]] using a different [[permutation]] for each character, and so implements a [[polyalphabetic cipher|polyalphabetic]] [[substitution cipher]].

==Background==
The German navy started using Enigma machines in 1926; it was called ''Funkschlüssel C'' ("Radio cipher C").{{sfn|Kahn|1991|pp=39–41, 299}} By 15 July 1928,{{sfn|Kahn|1991|pp=41, 299}} the German Army (''[[Reichswehr]]'') had introduced their own version of the Enigma—the ''Enigma G''; a revised ''Enigma I'' (with [[Enigma machine#Plugboard|plugboard]]) appeared in June 1930.{{sfn|Kruh|Deavours|2002|p=97}} The Enigma I used by the German military in the 1930s was a 3-rotor machine. Initially, there were only three [[Enigma rotor details|rotors]] labeled ''I'', ''II'', and ''III'', but they could be arranged in any order when placed in the machine. Rejewski identified the rotor permutations by {{mvar|L}}, {{mvar|M}}, and {{mvar|N}}; the encipherment produced by the rotors altered as each character was encrypted. The rightmost permutation ({{mvar|N}}) changed with each character. In addition, there was a plugboard that did some additional scrambling.

The number of possible different rotor wirings is:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rejewski|1981|p=215}} This is the number of ways to arrange 26 distinct objects.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; 26! = 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000&lt;/math&gt;

The number of possible different [[Enigma machine#Reflector|reflector]] wirings is:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rejewski|1981|p=215}} Take the number of ways to arrange 26 distinct letters (26!) and pair the selected letters. The paired letters interchange, so divide by 2&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; to account for the two orderings of each pair. The order the pairs are enumerated does not matter, so divide by the number of ways to order the 13 pairs (13!).&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{26!}{2^{13} \, 13!} = 7,905,853,580,025&lt;/math&gt;

The number of possible different plugboard wirings (for six cables) is:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rejewski|1981|p=216}} Take the number of ways to arrange 26 distinct letters and pair off the first 12 letters; divide by 2&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; because the pairs can be swapped (AB is same as BA), divide by 6! because the order of the pairs does not matter, and divide by 14! because the order of the trailing 14 characters does not matter.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{26!}{2^6 \, 6! \, 14!} = 100,391,791,500&lt;/math&gt;

To encrypt or decrypt, the operator made the following machine key settings:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lisicki|1979|loc=p. 68, Bild 1, ''Beispiel'' (Example)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the rotor order (''Walzenlage'')
* the [[Enigma machine#Turnover|ring]] settings (''Ringstellung'')
* the plugboard connections (''Steckerverbindung'')
* an initial rotor position (''Grundstellung'')

In the early 1930s, the Germans distributed a secret monthly list of all the daily machine settings. The Germans knew that it would be foolish to encrypt the day's traffic using the same key, so each message had its own "message key". This message key was the sender-chosen initial rotor positions (e.g., YEK). The message key had to be conveyed to the recipient operator, so the Germans decided to encrypt it using the day's pre-specified daily ground setting (''Grundstellung''). The recipient would use the daily machine settings for all messages. He would set the Enigma's initial rotor position to the ground setting and decrypt the message key. The recipient would then set the initial rotor position to the message key and decrypt the body of the message.

The Enigma was used with radio communications, so letters were occasionally corrupted during transmission or reception. If the recipient did not have the correct message key, then the recipient could not decipher the message. The Germans decided to send the three-letter message key twice to guard against transmission errors. Instead of encrypting the message key "YEK" once and sending the encrypted key twice, the Germans doubled the message key to "YEKYEK" ("doubled key"), encrypted the doubled key with the ground setting, and sent the encrypted doubled key. The recipient could then recognize a garbled message key and still decrypt the message. For example, if the recipient received and decrypted the doubled key as "YEKYEN", then the recipient could try both message keys "YEK" and "YEN"; one would produce the desired message and the other would produce gibberish.

The encrypted doubled key was a huge cryptographic mistake because it allowed cryptanalysts to know two encipherments of the same letter, three places apart, for each of the three letters. The Polish codebreakers exploited this mistake in many ways. [[Marian Rejewski]] used the doubled key and some known daily keys obtained by a spy, to determine the wiring of the three rotors and the reflector. In addition, code clerks often did not choose secure random keys, but instead chose weak keys such as "AAA", "ABC", and "SSS". The Poles later used the doubled weak keys to find the unknown daily keys. The grill method was an early exploitation of the doubled key to recover part of the daily settings. The [[cyclometer]] and the [[Bomba (cryptography)|''bomba kryptologiczna'']] were later exploitations of the doubled key.

===Example message===
[[File:EnigmaMachineLabeled.jpg|thumb|The [[Enigma machine]] was an electro-mechanical [[rotor machine]] with a scrambler consisting of (from right to left) an entry drum, three rotors and a reflector. It was available commercially from the early 1920s and was modified for use by the German military who adopted it later in the decade.]]

Frode Weierud provides the procedure, secret settings, and results that were used in a 1930 German technical manual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cryptocellar.web.cern.ch/cryptocellar/Enigma/EMsg1930.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030213421/http://cryptocellar.web.cern.ch/cryptocellar/Enigma/EMsg1930.html |archivedate=2014-10-30 |df= }}, citing 1930 "Schlüsselanleitung zur Chiffriermachine Enigma I" ["Directions for use of Keys on the Cypher Machine 'Enigma I'"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Can be checked with a simulator. For example, http://people.physik.hu-berlin.de/~palloks/js/enigma/enigma-u_v20_en.html Select Enigma I, choose reflector A (at the time, the Germans only had one reflector), set the wheel order (II, I, III), set the rings (24, 13, 22), set the plugs (AM, FI, NV, PS, TU, WZ), activate the plugboard, and set the wheels to the ground setting ("FOL"). Typing ABLABL in the input box should produce PKPJXI as the output.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Daily settings (shared secret):
  Wheel Order  : II  I  III
  Ringstellung : 24  13  22 (XMV)
  Reflector    : A
  Plugboard    : A-M, F-I, N-V, P-S, T-U, W-Z
  Grundstellung: 06  15  12 (FOL)

Operator chosen message key : ABL
Enciphered starting with FOL: PKPJXI

Cleartext message to send and resulting ciphertext:
  Feindliche Infanteriekolonne beobachtet.
  Anfang Südausgang Bärwalde.
  Ende 3 km ostwärts Neustadt.

  FEIND LIQEI NFANT ERIEK 
  OLONN EBEOB AQTET XANFA 
  NGSUE DAUSG ANGBA ERWAL 
  DEXEN DEDRE IKMOS TWAER 
  TSNEU STADT

Resulting message:
  1035 – 90 – 341 – 
  PKPJX IGCDS EAHUG WTQGR
  KVLFG XUCAL XVYMI GMMNM
  FDXTG NVHVR MMEVO UYFZS
  LRHDR RXFJW CFHUH MUNZE
  FRDIS IKBGP MYVXU Z
&lt;/pre&gt;

The first line of the message is not encrypted. The "1035" is the time, "90" is number of characters encrypted under the message key, and "341" is a system indicator that tells the recipient how the message was encrypted (i.e., using Enigma with a certain daily key). The first six letters in the body ("PKPJXI") are the doubled key ("ABLABL") encrypted using the daily key settings and starting the encryption at the ground setting/Grundstellung "FOL". The recipient would decipher the first six letters to recover the message key ("ABL"); he would then set the machine's rotors to "ABL" and decipher the remaining 90 characters. Notice that the Enigma does not have numerals, punctuation, or [[Germanic umlaut|umlauts]]. Numbers were spelled out. Most spaces were ignored; an "X" was used for a period. Umlauts used their alternative spelling with a trailing "e". Some abbreviations were used: a "Q" was used for "CH".

When Rejewski started his attack in 1932, he found it obvious that the first six letters were the enciphered doubled key.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rejewski|1981|p=217}} stating, "The fact that the first six letters of each message formed its three-letter key, twice enciphered, was obvious, and I will not dwell on the matter."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key encryption===
The daily key settings and ground setting will permute the message key characters in different ways. That can be shown by encrypting six of the same letter for all 26 letters:
&lt;pre&gt;
AAAAAA -&gt; PUUJJN
BBBBBB -&gt; TKYWXV

From this information, the permutations for each of the six message keys can be found. Label each permutation ''A B C D E F''. These permutations are secret: the enemy should not know them.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A = &amp;\binom\texttt{abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz}

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Notice the permutations are disjoint transpositions.{{Elucidate|date=September 2014}} For the ''A'' permutation, it not only changes "A" into "P" but it also changes "P" into "A". That allows the machine to both encrypt and decrypt messages.

[[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] introduced ''[[Permutation#Two-line notation|two-line notation]]'' in 1815 and ''[[Permutation#Cycle notation|cycle notation]]'' in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Genesis of the Abstract Group Concept: A Contribution to the History of the Origin of Abstract Group Theory|first=Hans|last=Wussing|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2007|isbn=9780486458687|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xp3JymnfAq4C&amp;pg=PA94|quote=Cauchy used his permutation notation—in which the arrangements are written one below the other and both are enclosed in parentheses—for the first time in 1815.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Harkin |first1=Anthony A. |last2=Harkin |first2=Joseph B. |title=Geometry of Generalized Complex Numbers |journal=Mathematics Magazine |date=April 2004 |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=118–129 |url=http://people.rit.edu/harkin/research/articles/generalized_complex_numbers.pdf |doi=}} at page 129 implies both notations used in 1815.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Augustin-Louis |last=Cauchy |authorlink=Augustin-Louis Cauchy |contribution=Augustin Louis Cauchy on the Theory of Permutations |title=The History of Mathematics: A Reader |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Fauvel |editor2-first=Jeremy |editor2-last=Gray |editorlink2=Jeremy Gray |publisher=Macmillan Press in association with The Open University |year=1987 |pages=506–507 |isbn=9780333427910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rejewski's characteristic==
Rejewski made an incredible discovery. Without knowing the plugboard settings, the rotor positions, the ring settings, or the ground setting, he could solve for all the daily message keys. All he needed were enough messages and some code clerks using non-random message keys.

The message key is three characters long, so the doubled key is six characters long. Rejewski labeled the permutations for the successive message-key characters ''A B C D E F''. He did not know what those permutations were, but he did know that ''A'' and ''D'' permutations encrypted the same message key letter, that ''B'' and ''E'' encrypted the same letter, and that ''C'' and ''F'' encrypted the same letter. If {{mvar|p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the (unknown) plaintext letters of the message key and {{mvar|c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the corresponding (known) ciphertext letters, then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
p_1 &amp;= c_1 A^{-1}&amp;= p_4 &amp;= c_4 D^{-1} \\
p_2 &amp;= c_2 B^{-1}&amp;= p_5 &amp;= c_5 E^{-1} \\
p_3 &amp;= c_3 C^{-1}&amp;= p_6 &amp;= c_6 F^{-1} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The equations can be post multiplied by ''D'', ''E'', and ''F'' respectively to simplify the right hand sides:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
p_1 D &amp;= c_1 A^{-1}D &amp;= p_4 D &amp;= c_4 \\
p_2 E &amp;= c_2 B^{-1}E &amp;= p_5 E &amp;= c_5 \\
p_3 F &amp;= c_3 C^{-1}F &amp;= p_6 F &amp;= c_6 \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The plaintext values are unknown, so those terms are just dropped to leave:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
c_1 A^{-1}D&amp;= c_4 \\
c_2 B^{-1}E&amp;= c_5 \\
c_3 C^{-1}F&amp;= c_6 \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The above equations describe a path through the permutations. If {{mvar|c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is passed through the inverse of {{mvar|A}}, then it produces {{mvar|p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If that character passes through {{mvar|D}}, then the result is {{mvar|c&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Rejewski also knew that the Enigma permutations were self inverses: Enigma encryption and decryption were identical. That means that {{math|A A {{=}} I}} where {{mvar|I}} is the identity permutation. Consequently, {{math|''A''{{=}}''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Thus:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
c_1 AD &amp;= c_4 \\
c_2 BE &amp;= c_5 \\
c_3 CF &amp;= c_6 \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The above equations show the relationship between the doubled key characters. Although Rejewski did not know the individual permutations ''A B C D E F'', a single message told him how specific characters were permuted by the composed permutations ''AD'', ''BE'', and ''CF''.

From many messages, Rejewski could determine the composed permutations completely. In practice, about 60 messages were needed to determine the permutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rejewski|1981|p=??}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rejewski recorded the three permutations with a cyclic notation he called the characteristic. {{Harvtxt|Rejewski|1981|p=217}} gives an example:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
AD &amp;= \texttt{(dvpfkxgzyo)(eijmunglht)(bc)(rw)(a)(s)} \\
BE &amp;= \texttt{(blfqveoum)(hjpswizrn)(axt)(cgy)(d)(k)} \\
CF &amp;= \texttt{(abviktjgfcqny)(duzrehlxwpsmo)} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In this notation, the first cycle of permutation {{mvar|AD}} would map d to v, v to p, p to f, ..., y to o, and o would wrap around to d.

Marks and Weierud give and example from [[Alan Turing]] that shows these cycles can be completed when some information is incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Marks |first1=Philip |last2=Weierud |first2=Frode |date=January 2000 |title=Recovering the Wiring of Enigma's ''Umkehrwalze'' A |journal=Cryptologia |volume=24 |issue=1 |url=http://cryptocellar.org/pubs/ukwa.pdf |pages=55&amp;ndash;66 |doi=10.1080/0161-110091888781}} (page 3 in PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Enigma permutations were simple transpositions, which meant that each permutation ''A B C D E F'' only transposed pairs of characters. Those character pairs had to come from different cycles of the same length. Moreover, any one pairing between two cycles determined all the other pairs in those cycles. Consequently, permutations ''A'' and ''D'' both had to transpose a and s because (a) and (s) are the only cycles of length one and there is only one way to pair them. There are two ways to match (bc) and (rw) because b must pair with either r or w. Similarly, there are ten ways to match the remaining ten-character cycles. In other words, Rejewski now knew that there were only twenty possibilities for the permutations ''A'' and ''D''. Similarly, there were 27 candidates for ''B'' and ''E'', and 13 candidates for ''C'' and ''F''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Jirí |last=Tuma |title=Permutation Groups and the Solution of German Enigma Cipher |p=51 |publisher=Frode Weierud |year=2003 |url=http://cryptocellar.web.cern.ch/cryptocellar/Enigma/tuma2003.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weak keys===
At this point, the Poles would exploit weaknesses in the code clerks' selection of message keys to determine which candidates were the correct ones. If the Poles could correctly guess the key for a particular message, then that guess would anchor two cycles in each of the three characteristics.

The Poles intercepted many messages; they would need about 60 messages in the same daily key to determine the characteristic, but they may have many more. Early on, Rejewski had identified the six characters that made up the message key.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rejewski|1981|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the code clerks were choosing random message keys, then one would not expect to see much correlation in the encrypted six characters. However, some code clerks were lazy. What if, out of a hundred messages, there were five messages from five different stations (meaning five different code clerks) that all used the same message key "PUUJJN"?&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lisicki|1979|pp=72–74}} gives an example table of 65 message keys, but only 40 of those keys were distinct. Sixteen keys were repeated at least once. The encrypted key "SYX SCV" was used five times; it corresponded to the message key "AAA". The encrypted message key "RJL WPX" was used four times; it corresponded to "BBB".&lt;/ref&gt; That they all came up with the same key suggests they used a very simple or very common key. The Poles kept track of different stations and how those stations would choose message keys. Early on, clerks often used simple keys such as "AAA" or "BBB".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rejewski|1981|p=218}} states, "When I first assumed that there would be many keys of the sort ''aaa'', ''bbb'', etc., it was only a hypothesis that luckily turned out to be true. The changing tastes of cryptographers were very carefully followed, and other predilictions were uncovered."&lt;/ref&gt;

The end result was that without knowing the Enigma's plugboard settings, the rotor positions, or the ring settings, Rejewski determined each of the permutations ''A B C D E F'', and hence all of the day's message keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rejewski|1981|p=218}} stating, "Thus, one of the mysteries of the Enigma cipher, the secret of the message key, was solved.  It is interesting that knowledge of neither of the positions of the drums nor the daily keys – in other words, none of the remaining secrets of the Enigma cipher – was needed to attain the result."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Rejewski |first=Marian |title=An Application of the Theory of Permutations in Breaking the Enigma Cipher |journal=Applicaciones Mathematicae |volume=16 |issue=4 |location=Warsaw |year=1980 |quote=In this way, an accurate knowledge of preferences of the cryptographers together with the theorem on the product of transpositions enables us to find the only actual solution. |url=https://cryptocellar.web.cern.ch/cryptocellar/Enigma/rew80.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030213141/http://cryptocellar.web.cern.ch/cryptocellar/Enigma/rew80.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Rejewski used the knowledge of permutations ''A B C D E F'' (and a manual obtained by a French spy) to determine the rotor wirings. After learning the rotor wirings, the Poles used the permutations to determine the rotor order, plugboard connections, and ring settings through further steps of the grill method.

===Continuing the 1930 example===
Using the daily key in the 1930 technical manual above, then (with enough messages) Rejewski could find the following characteristics:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
AD &amp;= \texttt{(pjxroquctwzsy)(kvgledmanhfib)} \\
BE &amp;= \texttt{(kxtcoigweh)(zvfbsylrnp)(ujd)(mqa)} \\
CF &amp;= \texttt{(yvxqtdhpim)(skgrjbcolw)(un)(fa)(e)(z)} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Although there are theoretically 7 trillion possibilities for each of the ''A B C D E F'' permutations, the characteristics above have narrowed the ''A'' and ''D'' permutations to just 13 possibilities, ''B'' and ''E'' to just 30 possibilities, and ''C'' and ''F'' to just 20 possibilities. The characteristic for ''CF'' has two singleton cycles, &lt;tt&gt;(e)&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;(z)&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Later known as a "female".&lt;/ref&gt; Those singleton cycles must pair in the individual permutations, so the characteristic for ''CF'' implies that the "E" and "Z" exchange in both the ''C'' and ''F'' permutations.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
C &amp;= \texttt{(ez)...} \\
F &amp;= \texttt{(ez)...} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
The pairing of "E" and "Z" can be checked in the original (secret) permutations given above.

Rejewski would now know that indicators with the pattern "..E..E" were from a message key of "..Z"; similarly an indicator of "..Z..Z" were from a message key of "..E". In the day's traffic, he might find indicators such as "PKZJXZ"&lt;!--ABEABE--&gt; or "RYZOLZ"&lt;!--EEEEEE--&gt;; might one of these indicators be the common (lazy) message key "EEE"? The characteristic limits the number of possible permutations to a small number, and that allows some simple checks. "PKZJXZ" cannot be "EEE" because it requires "K" and "E" to interchange in ''B'', but both "K" and "E" are part of the same cycle in ''BE'': &lt;tt&gt;(kxtcoigweh)&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref name="Rejewski218"&gt;{{harvnb|Rejewski|1981|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interchanging letters must come from distinct cycles of the same length. The repeating key could also be confirmed because it could uncover other repeating keys.&lt;ref name="Rejewski218"/&gt;

The indicator "RYZOLZ" is a good candidate for the message key "EEE", and it would immediately determine both permutations ''A'' and ''D''. For example, in ''AD'', the assumed message key "EEE" requires that "E" and "R" interchange in ''A'' and that "E" and "O" interchange in ''D''.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A &amp;= \texttt{(er)...} \\
D &amp;= \texttt{(eo)...} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If "E" interchanges with "R" in ''A'' (notice one character came from the first cycle in ''AD'' and the other character came from the second cycle), then the letter following "E" (i.e. "D") will interchange with the letter preceding "R" (i.e. "X") .
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A &amp;= \texttt{(er)(dx)...} \\
D &amp;= \texttt{(eo)...} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

That can be continued to get all the characters for both permutations.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A &amp;= \texttt{(er)(dx)(jm)(ap)(ny)(hs)(fz)(iw)(bt)(ck)(uv)(gq)(lo)} \\
D &amp;= \texttt{(eo)(lq)(gu)(cv)(kt)(bw)(iz)(fs)(hy)(np)(ag)(mx)(dr)} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This characteristic notation is equivalent to the expressions given for the 1930 permutations ''A'' and ''D'' given above by sorting the cycles so that the earliest letter is first.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A &amp;= \texttt{(ap)(bt)(ck)(dx)(er)(fz)(gq)(hs)(iw)(jm)(lo)(ny)(uv)} \\
D &amp;= \texttt{(aj)(bw)(cv)(dr)(eo)(fs)(gu)(hy)(iz)(kt)(lq)(mx)(np)} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The guessed message key of "EEE" producing indicator "RYZOLZ" would also determine the pairing of the 10-long cycles in permutation ''BE''.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
B &amp;= \texttt{(ey)(hs)(kb)(xf)(tv)(cz)(op)(in)(gr)(wl)...} \\
E &amp;= \texttt{(le)(rw)(ng)(pi)(zo)(vc)(ft)(bx)(sk)(yh)...} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

That determines most of ''B'' and ''E'', and there would only be three possible variations left that pair &lt;tt&gt;(ujd)&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;(mqa)&lt;/tt&gt;. There are still 20 possible variations for ''C'' and ''F''. At this point, the Poles could decrypt all of the first and fourth letters of the daily keys; they could also decrypt 20 out 26 of the second and fifth letters. The Poles' belief in these permutations could be checked by looking at other keys and seeing if they were typical keys used by code clerks.&lt;!--They could confirm a ZZZ key--&gt;

With that information, they could go looking for and find other likely weak message keys that would determine the rest of the ''A B C D E F'' permutations. For example, if the Poles had an indicator "TKYWXV", they could decrypt it as "BB.BB."; checking the cycles for ''CF'' would reveal that the indicator is consistent with message key "BBB".

==Rejewski's model==
Rejewski modeled the machine as permutation made from permutations of plugboard ({{mvar|S}}), the wiring from the keyboard/lamps to the rotors ({{mvar|H}}), the three rotors ({{mvar|LMN}}), and the reflector ({{mvar|R}}). The permutation for each position of the doubled key was different, but they were related by a permutation {{mvar|P}} that represented a single step of a rotor ({{mvar|P}} is known). Rejewski assumed that the left and middle rotors did not move while encrypting the doubled key. The six letters of the doubled key consequently see the permutations A B C D E F:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rejewski|1981|loc=p. 219 equation 3 with {{mvar|H}} removed}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A &amp;= S H (P^{1}NP^{-1}) L M R M^{-1} L^{-1} (P^{1}N^{-1}P^{-1}) H^{-1} S^{-1} \\
B &amp;= S H (P^{2}NP^{-2}) L M R M^{-1} L^{-1} (P^{2}N^{-1}P^{-2}) H^{-1} S^{-1} \\

D &amp;= S H (P^{4}NP^{-4}) L M R M^{-1} L^{-1} (P^{4}N^{-1}P^{-4}) H^{-1} S^{-1} \\
E &amp;= S H (P^{5}NP^{-5}) L M R M^{-1} L^{-1} (P^{5}N^{-1}P^{-5}) H^{-1} S^{-1} \\
F &amp;= S H (P^{6}NP^{-6}) L M R M^{-1} L^{-1} (P^{6}N^{-1}P^{-6}) H^{-1} S^{-1} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Rejewski simplied&lt;!-- explain why the simplication is important--&gt; these equations by creating {{mvar|Q}} as a composite reflector made from the real reflector and two leftmost rotors:
:&lt;math&gt;Q = L M R M^{-1} L^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution produces:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A &amp;= S H (P^{1}NP^{-1}) Q (P^{1}N^{-1}P^{-1}) H^{-1} S^{-1} \\
B &amp;= S H (P^{2}NP^{-2}) Q (P^{2}N^{-1}P^{-2}) H^{-1} S^{-1} \\
C &amp;= S H (P^{3}NP^{-3}) Q (P^{3}N^{-1}P^{-3}) H^{-1} S^{-1} \\
D &amp;= S H (P^{4}NP^{-4}) Q (P^{4}N^{-1}P^{-4}) H^{-1} S^{-1} \\
E &amp;= S H (P^{5}NP^{-5}) Q (P^{5}N^{-1}P^{-5}) H^{-1} S^{-1} \\
F &amp;= S H (P^{6}NP^{-6}) Q (P^{6}N^{-1}P^{-6}) H^{-1} S^{-1} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The result is six equations in four unknowns (''S H N Q'').&lt;ref name="Rejewski 1981 219"&gt;{{harvnb|Rejewski|1981|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rejewski had a commercial Enigma machine, and he initially thought that {{mvar|H}} would be the same. In other words, Rejewski guessed that
:&lt;math&gt; H = \binom{qwertzuioasdfghjkpyxcvbnml}{abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz}&lt;/math&gt;
Later, Rejewski realized that guess was wrong. Rejewski then guessed (correctly) that {{mvar|H}} was just the identity permutation:
:&lt;math&gt; H = \binom{abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz}{abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz}&lt;/math&gt;
That still left three unknowns. Rejewski comments:
: So I had a set of six equations in three unknowns, S, N, and Q. While I puzzled over how to solve that set of equations, on December 9, 1932, completely unexpectedly and at the most opportune moment, a photocopy of two tables of daily keys for September and October 1932 was delivered to me.&lt;ref name="Rejewski 1981 219"/&gt;

Having the daily keys meant that {{mvar|S}} was now known. The known permutations were moved to the left side in the equations by premultiplying and post multiplying.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H^{-1} S^{-1} A  S H &amp;= (P^{1}NP^{-1}) Q (P^{1}N^{-1}P^{-1}) \\
H^{-1} S^{-1} B  S H &amp;= (P^{2}NP^{-2}) Q (P^{2}N^{-1}P^{-2}) \\
H^{-1} S^{-1} C  S H &amp;= (P^{3}NP^{-3}) Q (P^{3}N^{-1}P^{-3}) \\
H^{-1} S^{-1} D  S H &amp;= (P^{4}NP^{-4}) Q (P^{4}N^{-1}P^{-4}) \\
H^{-1} S^{-1} E  S H &amp;= (P^{5}NP^{-5}) Q (P^{5}N^{-1}P^{-5}) \\
H^{-1} S^{-1} F  S H &amp;= (P^{6}NP^{-6}) Q (P^{6}N^{-1}P^{-6}) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The leftmost and rightmost {{mvar|P}} permutations on the right-hand side (which were also known) were moved to the left; the results were given the variable names ''U V W X Y Z'':
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
U &amp;= P^{-1} H^{-1} S^{-1} A  S H P^{1} &amp;= (NP^{-1}) Q (P^{1}N^{-1}) \\
V &amp;= P^{-2} H^{-1} S^{-1} B  S H P^{2} &amp;= (NP^{-2}) Q (P^{2}N^{-1}) \\
W &amp;= P^{-3} H^{-1} S^{-1} C  S H P^{3} &amp;= (NP^{-3}) Q (P^{3}N^{-1}) \\
X &amp;= P^{-4} H^{-1} S^{-1} D  S H P^{4} &amp;= (NP^{-4}) Q (P^{4}N^{-1}) \\
Y &amp;= P^{-5} H^{-1} S^{-1} E  S H P^{5} &amp;= (NP^{-5}) Q (P^{5}N^{-1}) \\
Z &amp;= P^{-6} H^{-1} S^{-1} F  S H P^{6} &amp;= (NP^{-6}) Q (P^{6}N^{-1}) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Rejewski then multiplied each equation with the next:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
U V &amp;= (NP^{-1}) Q (P^{1}N^{-1}) (NP^{-2}) Q (P^{2}N^{-1}) &amp;= NP^{-1} (Q P^{-1} Q P) P^{1}N^{-1} \\
V W &amp;= (NP^{-2}) Q (P^{2}N^{-1}) (NP^{-3}) Q (P^{3}N^{-1}) &amp;= NP^{-2} (Q P^{-1} Q P) P^{2}N^{-1} \\
W X &amp;= (NP^{-3}) Q (P^{3}N^{-1}) (NP^{-4}) Q (P^{4}N^{-1}) &amp;= NP^{-3} (Q P^{-1} Q P) P^{3}N^{-1} \\
X Y &amp;= (NP^{-4}) Q (P^{4}N^{-1}) (NP^{-5}) Q (P^{5}N^{-1}) &amp;= NP^{-4} (Q P^{-1} Q P) P^{4}N^{-1} \\
Y Z &amp;= (NP^{-5}) Q (P^{5}N^{-1}) (NP^{-6}) Q (P^{6}N^{-1}) &amp;= NP^{-5} (Q P^{-1} Q P) P^{5}N^{-1} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Next, Rejewski eliminated the common subexpression {{math|(''Q'' ''P''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; ''Q'' ''P'')}} by substituting its value obtained from the previous product.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rejewski|1981|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
V W &amp;= NP^{-1}N^{-1} (UV) NP^{1}N^{-1} \\
W X &amp;= NP^{-1}N^{-1} (VW) NP^{1}N^{-1} \\
X Y &amp;= NP^{-1}N^{-1} (WX) NP^{1}N^{-1} \\
Y Z &amp;= NP^{-1}N^{-1} (XY) NP^{1}N^{-1} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The result is a set of four equations in just one unknown: {{math|''NPN''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

===Back to 1930 example===

are transformed to the {{mvar|U V W X Y Z}} permutations:

  Y  ltgmwycsvqxadzrujohbpiekfn
  Z  mskpiyuteqcravzdjlbhgnxwfo
&lt;/pre&gt;
and then multiplied to produce the five successive products:

&lt;pre&gt;
       ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
  UV = azoselgjuhnmwiqdtxcbvfkryp = (a)(e)(g)(y)(hj)(rx)(bzpdscoqt)(flmwkniuv)
  VW = sxdqlkunjihgfeopatyrmvwzbc = (o)(p)(v)(w)(ij)(rt)(asybxzcdq)(elgumfkhn)
  WX = pbxdefiwgmlonkhztsrajyuqcv = (b)(d)(e)(f)(gi)(rs)(apzvycxqt)(hwujmnklo)
  XY = qwaytmoihlkgbjfpzcvdusnxre = (k)(p)(u)(x)(hi)(sv)(aqzetdyrc)(bwnjlgofm)
  YZ = rhuaxfkbnjwmpolgqztsdeicyv = (f)(j)(q)(y)(bh)(st)(arzvexcud)(gkwinolmp)
&lt;/pre&gt;
Now the goal is to find the single structure preserving map that transforms UV to VW, VW to WX, WX to XY, and XY to YZ. Found by subscription of cycle notation.{{clarify|date=July 2015}} When {{mvar|UV}} maps to {{mvar|VW}}, the map must mate cycles of the same length.  That means that &lt;code&gt;(a)&lt;/code&gt; in {{mvar|UV}} must map to one of &lt;code&gt;(o)(p)(v)(w)&lt;/code&gt; in {{mvar|VW}}. In other words, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; must map to one of &lt;code&gt;opvw&lt;/code&gt;. These can be tried in turn.

&lt;pre&gt;
  UV = (a)(e)(g)(y)(hj)(rx)(bzpdscoqt)(flmwkniuv)
  VW = (o)                                        (p)(v)(w)(ij)(rt)(asybxzcdq)(elgumfkhn)
 
  VW = (o)(p)(v)(w)(ij)(rt)(asybxzcdq)(elgumfkhn)
  WX =                                            (b)(d)(e)(f)(gi)(rs)(apzvycxqt)(hwujmnklo)
 
  WX = (b)(d)(e)(f)(gi)(rs)(apzvycxqt)(hwujmnklo)
  XY =                                            (k)(p)(u)(x)(hi)(sv)(aqzetdyrc)(bwnjlgofm)
 
  XY = (k)(p)(u)(x)(hi)(sv)(aqzetdyrc)(bwnjlgofm)
  YZ =                                            (f)(j)(q)(y)(bh)(st)(arzvexcud)(gkwinolmp)
&lt;/pre&gt;

But &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; must map the same to &lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt; in each pairing, so other character mappings are also determined:

&lt;pre&gt;
  UV = (a)(e)(g)(y)(hj)(rx)(bzpdscoqt)(flmwkniuv)
  VW = (o)                                        (p)(v)(w)(ij)(rt)(asybxzcdq)(elgumfkhn)
 
  VW = (o)(p)(v)(w)(ij)(rt)(asybxzcdq)(elgumfkhn)
  WX =                     (ohwujmnkl)            (b)(d)(e)(f)(gi)(rs)(apzvycxqt)
 
  WX = (b)(d)(e)(f)(gi)(rs)(apzvycxqt)(hwujmnklo)
  XY =                     (ofmbwnjlg)            (k)(p)(u)(x)(hi)(sv)(aqzetdyrc)
 
  XY = (k)(p)(u)(x)(hi)(sv)(aqzetdyrc)(bwnjlgofm)
  YZ =                     (olmpgkwin)            (f)(j)(q)(y)(bh)(st)(arzvexcud)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Consequently, the character maps for &lt;code&gt;sybxzcdq&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pzvycxqt&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;qzetdyrc&lt;/code&gt; are discovered and consistent. Those mappings can be exploited:
&lt;pre&gt;
  UV = (a)(e)(g)(y)(hj)(rx)(bzpdscoqt)(flmwkniuv)
  VW = (o)(p)   (w)    (ij)(umfkhnelg)(xzcdqasyb) (v)(rt)
 
  VW = (o)(p)(v)(w)(ij)(rt)(asybxzcdq)(elgumfkhn)
  WX =    (f)(b)       (ig)(ohwujmnkl)(pzvycxqta) (d)(e)(rs)
 
  WX = (b)(d)(e)(f)(gi)(rs)(apzvycxqt)(hwujmnklo)
  XY = (u)(k)(p)       (ih)(ofmbwnjlg)            (x)(sv)(aqzetdyrc)
 
  XY = (k)(p)(u)(x)(hi)(sv)(aqzetdyrc)(bwnjlgofm)
  YZ =    (f)   (j)    (hb)(olmpgkwin)(udarzvexc) (q)(y)(st)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which determines the rest of the map and consistently subscribes:
&lt;pre&gt;
  UV = (a)(e)(g)(y)(hj)(rx)(bzpdscoqt)(flmwkniuv)
  VW = (o)(p)(v)(w)(tr)(ij)(umfkhnelg)(xzcdqasyb)
 
  VW = (o)(p)(v)(w)(ij)(rt)(asybxzcdq)(elgumfkhn)
  WX = (e)(f)(b)(d)(sr)(ig)(ohwujmnkl)(pzvycxqta)
 
  WX = (b)(d)(e)(f)(gi)(rs)(apzvycxqt)(hwujmnklo)
  XY = (u)(k)(p)(x)(vs)(ih)(ofmbwnjlg)(tdyrcaqze)
 
  XY = (k)(p)(u)(x)(hi)(sv)(aqzetdyrc)(bwnjlgofm)
  YZ = (q)(f)(y)(j)(ts)(hb)(olmpgkwin)(udarzvexc)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The resulting map with successive subscriptions:
&lt;pre&gt;
 resulting map: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
                ounkpxvtsrqzcaeflihgybdjwm = (aoepfxjrishtgvbuywdkqlzmcn)
  UV = (a)(e)(g)(y)(hj)(rx)(bzpdscoqt)(flmwkniuv)
  VW = (o)(p)(v)(w)(tr)(ij)(umfkhnelg)(xzcdqasyb)
  WX = (e)(f)(b)(d)(gi)(sr)(ycxqtapzv)(jmnklohwu)
  XY = (p)(x)(u)(k)(vs)(hi)(wnjlgofmb)(rcaqzetdy)
  YZ = (f)(j)(y)(q)(bh)(ts)(darzvexcu)(inolmpgkw)
&lt;/pre&gt;
The map gives us {{math|''NPN''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, but that is also congugate (structure preserving). Consequently, the 26 possible values for {{mvar|N}} are found by subscribing {{mvar|P}} in 26 possible ways.&lt;!-- describe 26! taken down to just 26. The 26 possible are because the left side of N can be rotated in all possible 26 positions --&gt;

The model above ignored the right rotor's ring setting (22) and ground setting (12), both of which were known because Rejewski had the daily keys. The ring setting has the effect of counterrotating the drum by 21; the ground setting advances it by 11. Consequently, the rotor rotation is -10, which is also 16.

==Grill==
The physical grill{{clarify|date=September 2014}} was used to determine both the rightmost rotor, its initial position, and the plugboard settings.

===Bottom sheet===
Rejewsky observed that {{mvar|S}} is close to the identity permutation (in the early 1930s, only 12 of 26 letters were affected by the plugboard). He moved everything but {{mvar|Q}} to the left side of the equations by premultiplying or postmultiplying. The resulting system of equations is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(P^{1}N^{-1}P^{-1}) S^{-1} A S (P^{1}NP^{-1}) &amp;= Q \\
(P^{2}N^{-1}P^{-2}) S^{-1} B S (P^{2}NP^{-2}) &amp;= Q \\
(P^{3}N^{-1}P^{-3}) S^{-1} C S (P^{3}NP^{-3}) &amp;= Q \\
(P^{4}N^{-1}P^{-4}) S^{-1} D S (P^{4}NP^{-4}) &amp;= Q \\
(P^{5}N^{-1}P^{-5}) S^{-1} E S (P^{5}NP^{-5}) &amp;= Q \\
(P^{6}N^{-1}P^{-6}) S^{-1} F S (P^{6}NP^{-6}) &amp;= Q \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

At his point, {{mvar|Q}} is unknown, but it is the same for each equation. Rejewski does not know {{mvar|N}}, but he knows it is one of the rotors (I, II, and III), and he knows the wiring for each of those rotors. There were only three rotors and 26 possible initial rotations. Consequently, there are only 84 possible values for {{mvar|N}}. Rejewski can look at each possible value to see if the {{mvar|Q}} permutation is consistent. If there were no steckers ({{mvar|S}} were the identity), then each equation would produce the same {{mvar|Q}}.

Consequently, he made one bottom sheet for each possible rotor (three sheets). Each bottom sheet consisted of 31 lines (26 + 5 to make six lines contiguous). Each line contained the stepped permutation of a known rotor.&lt;ref name="Rejewski1981p222"/&gt; For example, a suitable bottom sheet for rotor III is,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
P^{0}&amp;NP^{-0}   &amp;\ \texttt{bdfhjlcprtxvznyeiwgakmusqo} \\
P^{1}&amp;NP^{-1}   &amp;\ \texttt{cegikboqswuymxdhvfzjltrpna} \\
P^{2}&amp;NP^{-2}   &amp;\ \texttt{dfhjanprvtxlwcgueyiksqomzb} \\
&amp;... &amp;... \\
P^{25}&amp;NP^{-25} &amp;\ \texttt{pcegikmdqsuywaozfjxhblnvtr} \\
P^{0}&amp;NP^{-0}   &amp;\ \texttt{bdfhjlcprtxvznyeiwgakmusqo} \\
P^{1}&amp;NP^{-1}   &amp;\ \texttt{cegikboqswuymxdhvfzjltrpna} \\
P^{2}&amp;NP^{-2}   &amp;\ \texttt{dfhjanprvtxlwcgueyiksqomzb} \\
P^{3}&amp;NP^{-3}   &amp;\ \texttt{egizmoquswkvbftdxhjrpnlyac} \\
P^{4}&amp;NP^{-4}   &amp;\ \texttt{fhylnptrvjuaescwgiqomkxzbd} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

In the early 1930s, the rotor order was the same for a month or more, so the Poles usually knew which rotor was in the rightmost position and only needed to use one bottom sheet. After 1 November 1936, the rotor order changed every day. The Poles could use the [[Clock (cryptography)|clock method]] to determine the rightmost rotor, so the grill would only need to examine that rotor's bottom sheet.&lt;ref name="Rejewski 1981 223"&gt;{{harvnb|Rejewski|1981|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Top sheet===
&lt;!-- the extraction of the permutations A through F from messages --&gt;

For the top sheet, Rejewski wrote the six permutations {{mvar|A}} through {{mvar|F}}.

&lt;pre&gt;
A: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
   srwivhnfdolkygjtxbapzecqmu
(..slit......................)
...

F: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
   wxofkduihzevqscymtnrglabpj
(..slit......................)
&lt;/pre&gt;
There were six slits so the permutations on the bottom sheet would show through at the proper place.

The top sheet would then be slid through all possible positions of rotor {{mvar|N}}, and the cryptanalyst would look for consistency with some unknown but constant permutation {{mvar|Q}}.  If there is not a consistent {{mvar|Q}}, then the next position is tried.

Here's what the grill would show for the above permutations at its consistent alignment:
&lt;pre&gt;
A: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
   ptkxrzqswmcojylagehbvuidnf
17 fpjtvdbzxkmoqsulyacgeiwhnr (visible through slit)

B: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
   ukzmyxrsnqbwdipojghvatlfec
18 oisucaywjlnprtkxzbfdhvgmqe (visible through slit)

C: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
   uymsznqwovtpcfilgxdkajhrbe
19 hrtbzxvikmoqsjwyaecguflpdn (visible through slit)

D: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
   jwvrosuyzatqxpenldfkgcbmhi
20 qsaywuhjlnprivxzdbftekocmg (visible through slit)

E: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
   jxvqltnypaseugzidwkfmcrbho
21 rzxvtgikmoqhuwycaesdjnblfp (visible through slit)

F: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
   nvykzutslxdioamwrqhgfbpjce
22 ywusfhjlnpgtvxbzdrcimakeoq (visible through slit)
&lt;/pre&gt;

In permutation {{mvar|A}}, the cryptanalyst knows that &lt;code&gt;(c k)&lt;/code&gt; interchange. He can see how rotor III would scramble those letters by looking at the first line (the alphabet in order) and the line visible through the slit.  The rotor maps &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; and it maps &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;. If we ignore steckers for the moment, that means permutation {{mvar|Q}} would interchange &lt;code&gt;(j m)&lt;/code&gt;.  For {{mvar|Q}} to be consistent, it must be the same for all six {{mvar|A B C D E F}} permutations.

Look at the grill near permutation {{mvar|D}} to check if its {{mvar|Q}} also interchanges &lt;code&gt;(j m)&lt;/code&gt;. Through the slit, find the letter &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; and look in the same column two lines above it to find &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt;.  That tells us the rotor, when it has advanced three positions, now maps &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;.  Similarly, the advanced rotor will map &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;.  Looking at permutation {{mvar|D}}, it interchanges &lt;code&gt;(h y)&lt;/code&gt;, so the two tests are consistent.

Similarly, in permutation {{mvar|A}}, the &lt;code&gt;(d x)&lt;/code&gt; interchange and imply that &lt;code&gt;(t h)&lt;/code&gt; interchange in {{mvar|Q}}.  Looking at permutation {{mvar|E}}, &lt;code&gt;(e l)&lt;/code&gt; interchange and also imply that &lt;code&gt;(t h)&lt;/code&gt; interchange in {{mvar|Q}}.

All such tests would be consistent if there were no steckers, but the steckers confuse the issue by hiding such matches. If any of the letters involved in the test is steckered, then it will not look like a match.&lt;!-- Rejewski characterized the search as tedious; see quote below. --&gt;

The effect of the rotor permutation can be removed to leave the {{mvar|Q}} implied by the {{mvar|A B C D E F}} permutations.  The result (along with the actual value of {{mvar|Q}}) is:
&lt;pre&gt;
   -: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Q(A): vyzrilptemqfjsugkdnhoaxwbc
Q(B): myqvswpontxzaihgcuejrdfkbl
Q(C): vcbrpmoulxwifzgeydtshakjqn
Q(D): kyirhulecmagjqstndopfzxwbv
Q(E): vemgbkdtwufzcxrysoqhjainpl
Q(F): wvlrpqsmjizchtuefdgnobayxk

Q   : vyqrpkstnmfzjiuecdghoaxwbl (this actual Q is unknown to the cryptanalyst)
&lt;/pre&gt;
Most of the letters in an implied permutation are incorrect. An exchange in an implied permutation is correct if two letters are not steckered. About one half the letters are steckered, so the expectation is only one fourth of the letters in an implied permutation are correct. Several columns show correlations; column &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; has three &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; characters, and &lt;code&gt;(a v)&lt;/code&gt; interchange in the actual {{mvar|Q}}; column &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; has four &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; characters, and &lt;code&gt;(d r)&lt;/code&gt; interchange in {{mvar|Q}}.&lt;ref&gt;One of the &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; interchanges is accidental due to a double stecker mapping a different interchange.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Rejewski|1981|p=222}} describes the possibility of writing down the six implied {{mvar|Q}}s for all 26 possible rotor positions. Rejewski states, "If permutation {{mvar|S}} actually were the identity, then ... for a particular [initial position] we would obtain the same value for all expressions {{mvar|Q}} and in this way we would find the setting of drum {{mvar|N}}.  Permutation {{mvar|S}} does exist, however, so for no [initial position] will the expression {{mvar|Q}} be equal to each other, but among them will be a certain similarity for a particular [initial position], since permutation {{mvar|S}} does not change all the letters."

Rejewski states that writing down all the possible {{mvar|Q}} "would be too laborious", so he developed the grill (grid) method.&lt;ref name="Rejewski1981p222"&gt;{{harvnb|Rejewski|1981|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Next, the grid is moved along the paper on which the drum connections are written until it hits upon a position where some similarities show up among the several expression {{mvar|Q}}. ... In this way the setting of drum {{mvar|N}} and the changes resulting from permutation {{mvar|S}} are found simultaneously.  This process requires considerable concentration since the similarities I mentioned do not always manifest themselves distinctly and can be very easily overlooked."&lt;ref name="Rejewski1981p222"/&gt; The reference does not describe what techniques were used. Rejewski did state that the grill method required unsteckered pairs of letters.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Rejewski|1984c|p=242"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rejewski|1984c|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Permutation {{mvar|A}} has the exchanges &lt;code&gt;(ap)(bt)(ck)...&lt;/code&gt;. If we assume the exchange &lt;code&gt;(ap)&lt;/code&gt; is unsteckered, that implies {{mvar|Q}} exchanges &lt;code&gt;(fl)&lt;/code&gt;. The other five permutations {{mvar|B C D E F}} can be quickly checked for an unsteckered pair that is consistent with {{mvar|Q}} interchanging &lt;code&gt;(fl)&lt;/code&gt; — essentially checking column &lt;code&gt;F&lt;/code&gt; for other rows with &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; without computing the entire table. None are found, so &lt;code&gt;(ap)&lt;/code&gt; would have at least one stecker so the assumption it is unsteckered is abandoned. The next pair can be guessed as unsteckered. The exchange &lt;code&gt;(bt)&lt;/code&gt; implies {{mvar|Q}} exchanges &lt;code&gt;(pg)&lt;/code&gt;; that is consistent with &lt;code&gt;(lw)&lt;/code&gt; in {{mvar|B}}, but that guess fails to pan out because &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; are steckered.

&lt;/pre&gt;

 B finds (d y) steckered
 C finds (p r) steckered
 D finds (a s) steckered
 E finds (p x) steckered - but p is already steckered to r! failure
&lt;/pre&gt;

The third exchange &lt;code&gt;(ck)&lt;/code&gt; implies {{mvar|Q}} exchanges &lt;code&gt;(jm)&lt;/code&gt;; this time permutation {{mvar|D}} with an unsteckered &lt;code&gt;(hy)&lt;/code&gt; would be consistent with {{mvar|Q}} exchanging &lt;code&gt;(jm)&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;/pre&gt;
At this point, the guess is that the letters &lt;code&gt;chky&lt;/code&gt; are unsteckered.  From that guess, all the steckers can be solved for this particular problem. The known (assumed) exchanges in {{mvar|S}} are used to find exchanges in {{mvar|Q}}, and those exchanges are used to extend what is known about {{mvar|S}}.

Using those unsteckered letters as seeds finds &lt;code&gt;(hy)&lt;/code&gt; interchange in {{mvar|E}} and implies &lt;code&gt;(kf)&lt;/code&gt; is in {{mvar|Q}}; similarly &lt;code&gt;(cy)&lt;/code&gt; interchange in {{mvar|F}} and implies &lt;code&gt;(uo)&lt;/code&gt; is in {{mvar|Q}}. Examining &lt;code&gt;(uo)&lt;/code&gt; in the other permutations finds &lt;code&gt;(tu)&lt;/code&gt; is a stecker.&lt;!-- Q:(uo) inverted in perm C --&gt;

That adds letters &lt;code&gt;tu&lt;/code&gt; to the seeds. Those letters were also unknown above, so further information can be gleaned by revisiting: {{mvar|S}} also has &lt;code&gt;(g)(if)(x)&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;/pre&gt;

All of {{mvar|S}} is now known after examining 3 exchanges in {{mvar|Q}}. The rest of {{mvar|Q}} can be found easily.

When a match is found, then the cryptanalyst would learn both the initial rotation of {{mvar|N}} and the plugboard (''Stecker'') permutation {{mvar|S}}.&lt;ref name="Rejewski1981p222"/&gt;

==Recovering absolute rotor positions for the message key==
At this point, the rotor positions for the {{mvar|Q}} permutation is not known. That is, the initial positions (and possibly the order) of rotors {{mvar|L}} and {{mvar|M}} are not known. The Poles applied brute force by trying all possible initial positions ({{math|26&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 676}}) of the two rotors.&lt;ref name="Rejewski1981p222"/&gt; With three rotors, knowing which rotor was at position {{mvar|N}} meant there were only two possible ways to load the other two rotors.

&lt;!-- There may have been a quick way to do this check. Load the rotors into the machine. We know that (ap)(bt)(ck) interchange, so press the a key and keep it depressed. While keeping a depressed, rotate the middle rotor until the p lamp lights. While still pressing a, press b (this keeps the right rotor from advancing) and then release a. If the t lamp lights, continue checking other interchanges. If that fails, go back to pressing a and advance the left rotor by one position.(this may be explained in Kozaczuk appendix.--&gt;
Later, the Poles developed a catalog of all the {{mvar|Q}} permutations. The catalog was not large: there were six possible [[combination]]s of two left rotors with {{math|26&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;{{=}}676}} initial settings, so the catalog had 4,056 entries. After using the grill, the Poles would look up {{mvar|Q}} in the catalog to learn the order and initial positions of the other two rotors.&lt;ref name="Rejewski 1981 223"/&gt;

Initially, the Germans changed the rotor order infrequently, so the Poles would often know the rotor order before they began working. The rotor order changed every quarter until 1 February 1936. Then it changed every month until 1 November 1936, when it was changed daily.&lt;ref name="Rejewski 1981 223"/&gt;

==Recovering the ring setting==
The cryptanalyst now knew the plugboard, the rotor order, and the absolute setting of the rotors for the doubled key, but he did not know the ring setting. He also knew what the message key setting should be, but that setting was useless without knowing the ring setting. The ring setting could be anything, and that meant the Poles did know how to position the rotors for the message body.  All the work up to this point had focussed on exploiting the doubled key. To determine the ring setting, the attention now shifted to the actual message.

Here, the Germans had made another mistake. Each message usually started with the text "ANX", which was German ''an'' meaning "to:" with the "X" meaning space. The Poles applied brute force here, too. They would go through up to {{math|26&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 17,576}} settings to find settings that produced "ANX". Once found, the cryptanalyst would use the absolute setting of the rotors to determine the ring setting. The entire daily key was thus recovered.

Later, the Poles refined the brute force search technique. By examining some messages, they could determine the position of the rightmost rotor; consequently, only 676 rotor positions would have to be tried. Rejewski no longer remembers how this trick worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rejewski|1981|p=223}}: "...we soon noticed that if some part of the message was to begin with ''ANX'', several positions of drum ''N'' would be impossible and should no longer be considered.  Since there were a dozen or so messages every day in which one could expect to find the letters ''ANX'' at the beginning, it was usually possible to reject, purely by calculation, all impossible positions of drum ''N'' leaving just one or two to consider.  (I no longer remember which calculations had to be performed and on which theoretical principles they were based.)"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
The grill method is described by [[Marian Rejewski]] as being "manual and tedious"&lt;ref name = RejewskiKozaczuk290/&gt; and, like the later cryptologic bomb, as being "based... on the fact that the plug connections [in the Enigma's commutator, or "plugboard"] did not change all the letters." Unlike the bomb, however, "the grill method required unchanged ''pairs'' of letters [rather than] only unchanged letters."&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Rejewski|1984c|p=242"/&gt;

Initially, the plugboard only swapped six pairs of letters. That left more than half of the alphabet unaffected by permutation {{mvar|S}}. The number of steckers changed 1 August 1936; then it could be from five to eight pairs of letters were swapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rejewski|1981|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extra swapped characters reduced the effectiveness of the grid method, so the Poles started looking for other methods. The result was the cyclometer and corresponding card catalog; that method was immune to steckers.

The grill method found application as late as December 1938 in working out the wiring in two Enigma rotors newly introduced by the Germans. (This was made possible by the fact that a ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' net, while it had introduced the new drums IV and V, continued using the old system for enciphering the individual message keys.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rejewski|1984d|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September 1938, most German nets stopped encrypting the doubled key with a common setting (the ground setting). The Poles had been able to take advantage of all messages in a net using the same machine settings to encrypt the doubled key. Now most nets stopped doing that; instead, the operator would choose his own ground setting and send it in the clear to the recipient.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rejewski|1981|pp=225–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change frustrated the grill method and the cyclometer card catalog. One net, the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD) net, continued to use a common ground setting, and that net was used to reverse engineer new rotors (IV and V) that were introduced.&lt;ref name="Rejewski227"&gt;{{harvnb|Rejewski|1981|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SD net traffic was doubly encoded, so the ANX method would not work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rejewski|1981|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grill method would sometimes fail after the Germans increased the number of plugboard connections to ten on 1 January 1939. When the SD net switched to the new message-key protocol on 1 July 1939, the grill method (and the cyclometer method) were no longer useful.&lt;ref name="Rejewski227"/&gt;

Here's an example of the new message procedure for a message on 21 September 1938.&lt;ref&gt;http://cryptocellar.web.cern.ch/cryptocellar/Enigma/tbombe.html transcribed from Cryptologia, C. A. Deavours and Louis Kruh, "The Turing Bombe: Was It Enough?", Cryptologia, Vol. XIV, No.4, October 1990, pp. 331-349, at page 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

The "3 TLE" (German ''Teile'', parts) says it is a 3-part message; the "1TL" (German ''Teil'', part) says this is the first part; the "172" says there are 172 characters in the message (including the message key). For this message, the ground setting "FRX" is transmitted twice in the clear; the ground setting would/should be different for every message on net. Consequently, the Poles could not find the needed sixty message keys encrypted under the same ground setting. Without the same-key message volume, they could not determine the characteristic, so they could not determine the permutations ''A B C D E F'' or use the grill. For this message, the daily settings (rotor order, plugboard, and ring settings) were used with "FRX" to decrypt the first six characters ("HCALN U") to obtain the doubled message key ("AGIAGI").

To decrypt these messages, the Poles used other techniques to exploit the doubled message key.

While there, she began working with [[Habitat for Humanity|Habitat for Humanity International]]. In 1997 Fasenfest returned to Portland to work as director of the Performance Salon Series at North Portland's North Star Ballroom, an events arena which combined art and performance with [[Activism|social activism]], and in 2000 opened her last cafe, Groundswell.&lt;ref name="ore"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/visualarts/2007/10/last_thursday_part_iii.html |title=Harriet Fasenfest: The View From Here |last=Row |first=D.K. |date=17 November 2000 |accessdate=24 August 2011 |work=The Oregonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hydraulic telegraph''' ({{lang-el|υδραυλικός τηλέγραφος}}) is either of two different hydraulic-[[telegraph]] [[telecommunication]] systems. The earliest one was developed in [[Ancient Greece|4th-century BC Greece]], while the other was developed in 19th-century AD [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The Greek system was deployed in combination with [[semaphore|semaphoric]] fires, while the latter British system was operated purely by [[hydraulic]] fluid pressure.

Although both systems employed water in their sending and receiver devices, their transmission media were completely different. The ancient Greek system transmitted its semaphoric information to the receiver visually, which limited its use to line-of-sight distances in good visibility weather conditions only. The 19th-century British system used water-filled pipes to effect changes to the water level in the receiver unit (similar to a transparent water-filled flexible tube used as a level indicator), thus limiting its range to the [[hydraulic pressure]] that could be generated at the transmitter's device.&lt;ref name="distantwriting"&gt;[http://distantwriting.co.uk/noncompetitors.html Distant Writing: A History of the Telegraph Companies in Britain between 1838 and 1868 - Non-Competitors], Distantwriting.co.uk website. Retrieved 2009-07-14&lt;/ref&gt; 

While the Greek device was extremely limited in the codes (and hence the information) it could convey, the British device was never deployed in operation other than for very short-distance demonstrations.&lt;ref name="distantwriting" /&gt; The British device could, however, be used in any visibility within its range of operation so long as its conduits, if unheated, did not freeze in sub-zero temperatures —which contributed to its impracticality.

[[File:Hydraulic telegraph messages, 4th century BC (reconstruction).jpg|thumb|Reconstructed model, messages attached to rod, [[Thessaloniki Science Center and Technology Museum]]]]
The ancient Greek design was described in the 4th century BC by [[Aeneas Tacticus]] and the 3rd century BC by the historian [[Polybius]]. According to Polybius, it was used during the [[First Punic War]] to send messages between [[Sicily]] and [[Carthage]].

The system involved identical containers on separate hills, which are ''not'' connected to each other; each container would be filled with water, and a vertical rod floated within it. The rods were inscribed with various predetermined [[code]]s at various points along its height.

To send a message, the sending operator would use a torch to signal the receiving operator; once the two were synchronized, they would simultaneously open the [[spigot]]s at the bottom of their containers. Water would drain out until the water level reached the desired code, at which point the sender would lower his torch, and the operators would simultaneously close their spigots. Thus the length of time the sender's torch was visible could be correlated with specific predetermined codes and messages.

A contemporary description of the ancient telegraphic method was provided by Polybius. In [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], Polybius wrote:&lt;ref name="Lahanas"&gt;Lahanas, Michael, [http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Communication.htm Ancient Greek Communication Methods] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102224501/http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Communication.htm |date=2014-11-02 }}, Mlahanas.de website. Retrieved 2009-07-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Aeneas, the author of the work on strategy, [writing] to find a remedy for the difficulty, advanced matters a little, but his device still fell far short of our requirements, as can be seen from his description of it. 

He says that those who are about to [communicate] urgent news to each other by fire signal should procure two earthenware vessels of exactly the same width and depth, the depth being some three cubits and the width one. Then they should have corks made a little narrower than the mouths of the vessels [so that the cork slides through the neck and drops easily into the vessel] and through the middle of each cork should pass a rod graduated in equal section of three finger-breadths, each clearly marked off from the next. In each section should be written the most evident and ordinary events that occur in war, e.g., on the first, "Cavalry arrived in the country," on the second "Heavy infantry," on the third "Light-armed infantry," next "Infantry and cavalry," next "Ships," next "Corn," and so on until we have entered in all the sections the chief contingencies of which, at the present time, there is a reasonable probability in wartime. Next, he tells us to bore holes in both vessels of exactly the same size, so that they allow exactly the same escape.

Then we are to fill the vessels with water and put on the corks with the rods in them and allow the water to flow through the two apertures. When this is done it is evident that, the conditions being precisely similar, in proportion as the water escapes the two corks will sink and the rods will disappear into the vessels. When by experiment it is seen that the rapidity of escape is in both cases the same, the vessels are to be conveyed to the places in which both parties are to look after the signals and deposited there. Now whenever any of the contingencies written on the rods occurs he tells us to raise a torch and to wait until the corresponding party raises another. When both the torches are clearly visible the signaler is to lower his torch and at once allow the water to escape through the aperture. Whenever, as the corks sink, the contingency you wish to communicate reaches the mouth of the vessel he tells the signaler to raise his torch and the receivers of the signal are to stop the aperture at once and to note which of the messages written on the rods is at the mouth of the vessel. This will be the message delivered, if the apparatus works at the same pace in both cases.|Aeneas}}

== British hydraulic semaphore system ==

The British civil engineer [[Francis Whishaw]], who later became a principal in the General Telegraph Company, publicized a hydraulic telegraph in 1838 but was unable to deploy it commercially.&lt;ref&gt;Herapath, John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=hKwEAAAAQAAJ ''The Railway Magazine and Annals of Science, Vol. V.'': Hydraulic Telegraph (section)], London, Charing-Cross East: Wyld and Son, 1839, pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt; By applying pressure at a transmitter device connected to a water-filled pipe which travelled all the way to a similar receiver device, he was able to effect a change in the water level which would then indicate coded information to the receiver's operator.&lt;ref name="distantwriting" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whishaw, Francis. "Report of the Annual Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Volume 18, Parts 1848–1849: On The Uniformity Of Time And Other Telegraphs", ''[[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]]'' London: John Murray, 1849, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The system was estimated to cost £200 per mile (1.6 km) and could convey a vocabulary of 12,000 words.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sQ5AAAAAYAAJ The Civil Engineer and Architect's Journal, Volume 1: Oct. 1837 to Dec. 1838: Miscellany], London: William Laxton, 1838, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.K.'s ''Mechanics Magazine'' in March 1838 described it as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Steven. [http://distantwriting.co.uk/noncompetitors.html A History of Telegraph Companies In Britain Between 1838 And 1868: Whishaw's Hydraulic Telegraph], retrieved from DistantWriting.co.uk website January 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|...a column of water [can] be conveniently employed to transmit information. Mr. Francis Whishaw has conveyed a column of water through sixty yards of pipe in the most convoluted form, and the two ends of the column being on a level, motion is no sooner given to one end than it is communicated through the whole sixty yards to the other end of the column. No perceptible interval elapses between the time of impressing motion on one end of the column and of communicating it to the other. 

To each end of a column he attaches a float board with an index, and the depression of any given number of figures on one index, will be immediately followed by a corresponding rise of the float board and index at the other end. It is supposed that this simple longitudinal motion can be made to convey all kinds of information. It appears to us that the amount of information which can be conveyed by the motion in one direction only, of the water, or backward and forwards, must be limited. To make the mere motion backwards and forwards of a float board, indicated on a graduated index, convey a great number of words or letters, is the difficulty to be overcome.}}

The article concluded speculatively that the "... hydraulic telegraph may supersede the semaphore and the galvanic telegraph".&lt;ref name="distantwriting" /&gt;

Hydrilla('Waterthyme' ) or  '''hydrilla''') is a [[genus]] of [[aquatic plant]], usually treated as containing just one species, '''''Hydrilla verticillata''''', though some botanists divide it into several species. It is native to the cool and warm waters of the [[Old World]] in Asia, Africa and Australia, with a sparse, scattered distribution; in Australia from [[Northern Territory]], [[Queensland]], and [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=fe&gt;Flora Europaea: [http://rbg-web2.rbge.org.uk/cgi-bin/nph-readbtree.pl/feout?FAMILY_XREF=&amp;GENUS_XREF=Hydrilla&amp;SPECIES_XREF=&amp;TAXON_NAME_XREF=&amp;RANK= ''Hydrilla'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ft&gt;Flora of Taiwan: [http://tai2.ntu.edu.tw/udth/bin/fot1.exe/browse?bid=5&amp;page=15 ''Hydrilla'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apni&gt;Australian Plant Name Index: [http://www.anbg.gov.au/cgi-bin/apni?taxon_name=Hydrilla%25 ''Hydrilla'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The stems grow up to 1–2m long. The [[leaf|leaves]] are arranged in whorls of two to eight around the stem, each leaf 5–20&amp;nbsp;mm long and 0.7–2&amp;nbsp;mm broad, with serrations or small spines along the leaf margins; the leaf midrib is often reddish when fresh. It is [[plant sexuality|monoecious]] (sometimes [[plant sexuality|dioecious]]), with male and female [[flower]]s produced separately on a single plant; the flowers are small, with three sepals and three petals, the petals 3–5&amp;nbsp;mm long, transparent with red streaks. It reproduces primarily [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]] by fragmentation and by rhizomes and [[turion (botany)|turions]] (overwintering), and flowers are rarely seen.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt;&lt;ref name=fnwe&gt;Flora of NW Europe: [http://ip30.eti.uva.nl/BIS/flora.php?selected=beschrijving&amp;menuentry=soorten&amp;id=4171 ''Hydrilla verticillata''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208024427/http://ip30.eti.uva.nl/BIS/flora.php?selected=beschrijving&amp;menuentry=soorten&amp;id=4171 |date=2007-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=blamey&gt;Blamey, M. &amp; Grey-Wilson, C.

''Hydrilla'' has a high resistance to [[salinity]] compared to many other freshwater associated aquatic plants.

==Taxonomy and naming==
''Hydrilla'' closely resembles some other related aquatic plants, including ''[[Egeria densa]]'' and ''[[Elodea canadensis]]''.&lt;ref name=WADoE/&gt; [[Synonymy|Synonyms]] include ''H. asiatica'', ''H. japonica'', ''H. lithuanica'', and ''H. ovalifolica''.

==Ecology==
''Hydrilla verticillata'' is allelopathic to the common hornwort (''[[Ceratophyllum demersum]]'') and prickly hornwort (''[[Ceratophyllum muricatum|C. muricatum]]''), that is, it produces compounds that inhibit growth of the latter two species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Manjula Kulshreshtha |author2=B.

==Status as an invasive plant==

===Introduction===
[[Image:Plant - Hydrilla verticillata - Batu kawa.jpg|left|thumb|Foliage detail]]
''Hydrilla'' is [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] and [[invasive species|invasive]] in the [[United States]] following release in the 1950s and 1960s from aquariums into waterways in [[Florida]], due to the [[aquarium trade]].&lt;ref name=WADoE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/wq/plants/weeds/hydrilla.html|title=General Information About Hydrilla|publisher=''State of Washington, Department of Ecology''|accessdate=December 20, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220102925/http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/wq/plants/weeds/hydrilla.html|archive-date=2014-12-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now established in Canada and the southeast from [[Connecticut]] to [[Texas]], and also in [[California]].&lt;ref name=fna&gt;Flora of North America: [http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&amp;taxon_id=200024721 ''Hydrilla verticillata'']&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s control and management were costing millions of dollars each year.&lt;ref name=NEANS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northeastans.org/hydrilla/ecoleconhydrilla.htm|title=Ecological and Economic Costs Associated with Hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata)|publisher=''Northeast Aquatic Nuisance Species Panel''|accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, a Florida west coast aquarium dealer shipped live ''Hydrilla'' from [[Sri Lanka]] under the common name "Indian star-vine."&lt;ref name=SMS&gt;{{cite techreport|last=Masterson|first=J.|url= http://www.sms.si.edu/irlspec/Hydrilla_verticillata.htm|title=''Hydrilla verticillata''|publisher=''Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce''|date=October 4, 2007|accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After these plants were considered unsatisfactory, they were dumped into a canal near [[Tampa Bay]], where they flourished.&lt;ref name=SMS/&gt; By 1955, the plants found their way from Tampa to [[Miami]] as they were transported for cultivation and pet trade sale.&lt;ref name=SMS/&gt; It is believed that several undocumented cases of accidental or careless releases followed, as there was extensive spread of the ''Hydrilla'' throughout Florida and the southeastern U.S.&lt;ref name=SMS/&gt;

===Problems===
As an invasive species in Florida, ''Hydrilla'' has become the most serious aquatic weed problem for Florida and most of the U.S. Because it was such a threat as an [[invasive species]], restrictions were placed to allow only a single type of chemical, [[fluridone]], to be used as a herbicide. This was done to prevent the evolution of multiple mutants, and resulted in fluridone resistant ''Hydrilla''. “As ''Hydrilla'' spread rapidly to lakes across the southern United States in the past, the expansion of resistant biotypes is likely to pose significant environmental challenges in the future.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1614/P2002-081 |title=Predicting the potential invasive distributions of five alien plant species in North America |journal=Weed Science |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=863 |year=2003 |last1=Peterson |first1=A.

''Hydrilla'' populations have caused economic, environmental, and ecological damage.&lt;ref name=NEANS/&gt; ''Hydrilla'' is known to be an aggressive and competitive plant, even out-competing and displacing native species, such as [[potamogeton|pondweeds]] and [[Vallisneria americana|eelgrass]].&lt;ref name=SMS/&gt;&lt;ref name=UFIFAS/&gt;&lt;ref name=CCE/&gt; Due to its competitive nature, ''Hydrilla'' has created [[monoculture]]s, an area dominated by a singular species, rather than having a balance among many species, like in a normal ecosystem.&lt;ref name=CCE/&gt;

In Australia, ''Hydrilla'' can become invasive if the nutrient levels are raised in disturbed ecosystems, though is not generally known to be problematic.&lt;ref name="Parsons"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Thomas Parsons |author2=Eric George Cuthbertson |title=Noxious Weeds of Australia|publisher=Csiro Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria|date=2001|pages=67–70|isbn=9780643065147|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=sRCrNAQQrpwC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=The+biology+of+Australian+weeds.+7.+Hydrilla+verticillata+%28L.f.%29+Royle&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0R2RqJ87Aj&amp;sig=bRZJsrHhxePj2x7mBQrYQaKFrGI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U-gfVei8IYz1oASm8IG4BA&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20biology%20of%20Australian%20weeds.%207.%20Hydrilla%20verticillata%20(L.f.)%20Royle&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the inlet of Cayuga Lake, one of the Finger Lakes in New York State, used the chemical herbicide [[endothall]] to try to head off a possible future disaster. The first year nearly $100,000 and numerous man-hours were spent trying to eradicate the ''Hydrilla'' infestation. Follow-up treatments were planned for at least five years. The City of Ithaca as well as other local officials are willing to pay the price because without quick action the plant could get into the lake and possibly spread to other Finger Lakes in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150118022422/http://ccetompkins.org/environment/invasive-species/fighting-hydrilla2011 2011 Hydrilla Eradication Efforts – Cornell Cooperative Extension of Tompkins County].

When writing [[firmware]] for an [[embedded system]], '''immunity-aware programming''' refers to programming techniques which improve the tolerance of transient errors in the [[program counter]] or other modules of a program that would otherwise lead to failure. Transient errors are typically caused by [[single event upset]]s, insufficient power, or by strong [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] signals transmitted by some other "source" device.

Immunity-aware programming is an example of [[defensive programming]] and [[EMC-aware programming]]. Although most of these techniques apply to the software in the "victim" device to make it more reliable, a few of these techniques apply to software in the "source" device to make it emit less unwanted noise.

==Task and objectives==
[[Microcontrollers]]' [[firmware]] can inexpensively improve the [[electromagnetic compatibility]] of an [[embedded system]].

Embedded systems firmware is usually not considered to be a source of [[radio frequency interference]]. Radio emissions are often caused by [[harmonic]] frequencies of the system clock and switching currents.  The pulses on these wires can have fast rise and fall times, causing their wires to act as radio transmitters. This effect is increased by badly-designed [[printed circuit boards]]. These effects are reduced by using microcontroller output drivers with slower rise times, or by turning off system components.

The microcontroller is easy to control.  It is also susceptible to faults from radio frequency interference. Therefore, making the microcontroller's software resist such errors can cheaply improve the system's tolerance for electromagnetic interference by reducing the need for hardware alterations.

==Possible interferences of microcontroller-based systems==
[[CMOS]] [[microcontroller]]s have specific weak spots which can be strengthened by software that works against electromagnetic interference. [[Failure mode and effects analysis]] of a system and its requirements is often required.  Electromagnetic compatibility issues can easily be added to such an analysis.

===Power supply===
Slow changes of power supply voltage do not cause significant disturbances, but rapid changes can make unpredictable trouble. If a voltage exceeds parameters in the controller's data sheet by 150 percent, it can cause the input port or the output port to get hung in one state, known as CMOS [[latch-up]].&lt;ref&gt;Latch-up&amp;nbsp;– also known as [[Single Event Latch-up]] (SEL)&amp;nbsp;– is a short circuit of [[IC power supply pin|VDD]] ([[positive power supply]]) and [[IC power supply pin|VSS]] ([[negative power supply]]). The latch-up is caused by [[parasitic transistors]] (transistors that cannot be activated during normal operating conditions) of [[CMOS circuit]]s. Strong transient disturbances can activate transistors and thermally destroy the device.&lt;/ref&gt; Without internal current control, latch-up causes the microcontroller to burn out. The standard solution is a mix of software and hardware changes.  Most embedded systems have a [[watchdog timer]]. This watchdog should be external to the microcontroller so that it is likely to be immune to any plausible electromagnetic interference. It should reset the power supply, briefly switching it off.  The watchdog period should be half or less of the time and power required to burn out the microcontroller. The power supply design should be well-grounded and decoupled using capacitors and inductors close to the microcontroller; some typical values are 100uF and 0.1uF in parallel.

Low power can cause serious malfunctions in most microcontrollers. For the CPU to successfully decode and execute instructions, the supplied voltage must not drop below the minimum voltage level. When the supplied voltage drops below this level, the CPU may start to execute some instructions incorrectly. The result is unexpected activity on the internal data and control lines. This activity may cause:

* CPU register corruption
* I/O register corruption
* I/O pin random toggling
* [[Shadow Random Access Memory#Shadow RAM|SRAM corruption]]
* [[EEPROM]] corruption

[[Brownout (electricity)|Brownout]] detection solves most of those problems in most systems by causing the system to shut down when main power is unreliable.  One typical system retriggers a timer each time that the AC main voltage exceeds 90% of its rated voltage. If the timer expires, it interrupts the microcontroller, which then shuts down its system.  Many systems also measure the power supply voltages, to guard against slow power supply degradation.

===The oscillator===
The input ports of CMOS [[oscillator]]s have high [[Electrical impedance|impedances]], and are thus very susceptible to transient disturbances. According to [[Ohm's law]], high impedance causes high voltage differences.  They also are very sensitive to [[short circuit]] from moisture or dust.

One typical failure is when the oscillators' stability is affected.  This can cause it to stop, or change its period.  The normal system hedges are to have an auxiliary oscillator using some cheap, robust scheme such as a ring of inverters or a resistor-capacitor one-shot timer.  After a reset (perhaps caused by a watchdog timer), the system may default to these, only switching in the sensitive crystal oscillator once timing measurements have proven it to be stable.  It is also common in high-reliability systems to measure the clock frequency by comparing it to an external standard, usually a communications clock, the power line, or a resistor-capacitor timer.

Bursts of [[electromagnetic interference]] can shorten clock periods or cause runt pulses that lead to incorrect data access or command execution. The result is wrong memory content or program pointers. The standard method of overcoming this in hardware is to use an on-chip [[phase locked loop]] to generate the microcontroller's actual clock signal. [[software design|Software]] can periodically verify data structures and read critical ports using voting, distributing the reads in time or space.

===Input/output ports===
Input/output ports—including address lines and data lines—connected by long lines or external peripherals are the antennae that permit disturbances to have effects. Electromagnetic interference can lead to incorrect data and addresses on these lines. Strong fluctuations can cause the computer to misread I/O registers or even stop communication with these ports. [[Electrostatic discharge]] can actually destroy ports or cause malfunctions.

Most microcontrollers' pins are high impedance inputs or mixed inputs and outputs. High impedance input pins are sensitive to noise, and can register false levels if not properly terminated. Pins that are not terminated inside an IC need resistors attached.  These have to be connected to ground or supply, ensuring a known logic state.

[[Image:Misra EMC Error Analysis Chart.png|thumbnail|350px|Cause and effect figure. The cause must be determined, so the problem can be fixed.]]

==Corrective actions==
An analysis of possible errors before correction is very important. The cause must be determined so that the problem can be fixed.

The [[Motor Industry Software Reliability Association]]  identifies the required steps in case of an error as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.misra.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Information/warning the user
* Store the faulty data until a defined reset can be carried out
* Keep the system in a defined state until the error can be corrected

Fundamentally one uses redundancy to counter faults.  This includes running extra code (redundancy in time) as well as keeping extra bits (redundancy in space).

===Instruction pointer (IP) error management===
A disturbed [[instruction pointer]] can lead to serious errors, such as an undefined jump to an arbitrary point in the memory, where illegal instructions are read. The state of the system will be undefined. IP errors can be handled by use of software based solutions such as [[function token]]s and an [[NOP slide]](s).

Many processors, such as the Motorola 680x0, feature a hardware trap upon encountering an illegal instruction. A correct instruction, defined in the trap vector, is executed, rather than the random one. Traps can handle a larger range errors than function tokens and NOP slides. Supplementary to illegal instructions, hardware traps securely handle memory access violations, overflows, or a division by zero.

====Token passing (function token)====

[[Image:Token Passing.png|thumb|right|300px|Token passing as execution flow control]]
[[Image:Token Passing with Globals Function ID.png|thumb|right|300px|C source: token passing with global function ID.]]

Improved noise immunity can be achieved by execution flow control known as token passing. The figure to the right shows the functional principle schematically. This method deals with program flow errors caused by the instruction pointers.

The implementation is simple and efficient. Every function is tagged with a unique function ID. When the function is called, the function ID is saved in a global variable. The function is only executed if the function ID in the global variable and the ID of the function match. If the IDs do not match, an instruction pointer error has occurred, and specific corrective actions can be taken. A sample implementation of token passing using a global variable programmed in C is stated in the following source listing.

This is essentially an "arm / fire" sequencing, for every function call.  Requiring such a sequence is part of safe programming techniques, as it generates tolerance for single bit (or in this case, stray instruction pointer) faults.

The implementation of function tokens increases the program code size by 10 to 20%, and slows down the performance. To improve the implementation, instead of global variables like above, the function ID can be passed as an argument within the functions header as shown in the code sample below.

[[Image:Token Passing with Function Parameters.png|thumbnail|right|300px|C source: token passing with function parameters]]

====NOP slide====

{{Main|NOP slide}}
With NOP-Fills, the reliability of a system in case of a disturbed instruction pointer can be improved in some cases. The entire program memory that is not used by the program code is filled with No-Operation ([[NOP (code)|NOP]]) instructions. In machine code a NOP instruction is often represented by 0x00 (for example, Intel 8051, ATmega16, etc.). The system is kept in a defined state. At the end of the physical program memory, an instruction pointer error handling (IPEH IP-Error-Handler) has to be implemented. In some cases this can be a simple reset.

If an instruction pointer error occurs during the execution and a program points to a memory segment filled with NOP instructions, inevitably an error occurred and is recognized.

Three methods of implementing NOP-Fills are applicable:

*In the first method, the unused physical memory is set to 0x00 manually by search and replace in the (HEX) [[executable file|program file]]. The drawback of this method is that this has to be done after every compilation.

[[Image:Error Handler after NOP Fill.png|thumbnail|center|500px|Program memory filled with code, NOPs, and error handler]]

*The second method uses the ''fill'' option of the linker, which fills up the unused memory regions with a predefined constant (in this case 0x00).
*The third way is to include a corresponding number of NOP [[assembly language|assembler]] directives directly in the program code.

When using the [[CodevisionAVR C]] compiler, NOP fills can be implemented easily. The chip programmer offers the feature of editing the program [[flash memory|flash]] and [[EEPROM]] to fill it with a specific value. Using an [[Atmel]] ATmega16, no jump to reset address 0x00 needs to be implemented, as the overflow of the instruction pointer automatically sets its value to 0x00. Unfortunately, resets due to overflow are not equivalent to intentional reset. During the intended reset, all necessary MC registers are reset by hardware, which is not done by a jump to 0x00. So this method will not be applied in the following tests.
[[Image:Memory Function Token and NOP.png|thumbnail|right|350px|Memory before and after the implementation of both function token and NOP-Fills]]

===I/O register errors===
Microcontroller architecture requires the I/O leads to be placed at the outer edge of the silicon die. Thus I/O contacts are strongly affected by transient disturbances on their way to the silicon core, and I/O registers are one of the most vulnerable parts of the microcontroller. Wrongly-read I/O registers may lead to an incorrect system state. The most serious errors can occur at the reset port and interrupt input ports. Disturbed data direction registers (DDR) may inhibit writing to the bus.

These disturbances can be prevented as following:

'''1. Cyclic update of the most important registers'''

:By cyclically updating of the most important register and the data in the data direction registers in shortest possible intervals, errors can be reduced. Thus a wrongly set bit can be corrected before it can have negative effects.

'''2. Multiple read of input registers'''

:A further method of filtering disturbances is multiple read of input registers. The read-in values are then checked for consistency. If the values are consistent, they can be considered valid. A definition of a value range and/or the calculation of a mean value can improve the results for some applications.

:'''Side effect''': increased activity

:A drawback is the increased activity due to permanent updates and readouts of peripherals. This activity may add additional emissions and failures.

:'''External interrupt ports; stack overflow'''

:External interrupts are triggered by falling/rising edges or high/low potential at the interrupt port, leading to an interrupt request (IRQ) in the controller. Hardware interrupts are divided into maskable interrupts and non-maskable interrupts (NMI). The triggering of maskable interrupts can be stopped in some time-critical functions. If an interrupt is called, the current instruction pointer (IP) is saved on the stack, and the [[stack pointer]] (SP) is decremented. The address of the [[interrupt service routine]] (ISR) is read from the interrupt vector table and loaded to the IP register, and the ISR is executed as a consequence.

:If interrupts—due to disturbances—are generated faster than processed, the stack grows until all memory is used. Data on the stack or other data might be overwritten. A defensive software strategy can be applied. The stack pointer (SP) can be watched. The growing of the stack beyond a defined address can then be stopped. The value of the stack pointer can be checked at the start of the interrupt service routine. If the SP points to an address outside the defined stack limits, a reset can be executed.

===Data redundancy===
{{Main|error detection and correction}}
In systems without error detection and correction units, the reliability of the system can be improved by providing protection through software. Protecting the entire memory (code and data) may not be practical in software, as it causes an unacceptable amount of overhead, but it is a software implemented low-cost solution for code segments.

Another elementary requirement of digital systems is the faultless transmission of data. Communication with other components can be the weak point and a source of errors of a system. A well-thought-out transmission protocol is very important. The techniques described below can also be applied to data transmitted, hence increasing transmission reliability.

====Cyclic redundancy and parity check====
A [[cyclic redundancy check]] is a type of [[hash function]] used to produce a [[checksum]], which is a small integer from a large block of data, such as network traffic or computer files. CRCs are calculated before and after transmission or duplication, and compared to confirm that they are equal. A CRC detects all one- or two-bit errors, all odd errors, all burst errors if the burst is smaller than the CRC, and most of the wide-burst errors. [[Parity checks]] can be applied to single characters (VRC—[[vertical redundancy check]]), resulting in an additional [[parity bit]] or to a block of data (LRC—[[longitudinal redundancy check]]), issuing a block check character. Both methods can be implemented rather easily by using an XOR operation. A trade-off is that less errors can be detected than with the CRC. Parity Checks only detect odd numbers of flipped bits. The even numbers of bit errors stay undetected. A possible improvement is the usage of both VRC and LRC, called [[Double Parity]] or [[Optimal Rectangular Code]] (ORC).

Some microcontrollers feature a hardware CRC unit.

====Different kinds of duplication====
A specific method of data redundancy is duplication, which can be applied in several ways, as described in the following:

*'''Data duplication'''

:To cope with corruption of data, multiple copies of important registers and variables can be stored. Consistency checks between memory locations storing the same values, or voting techniques, can then be performed when accessing the data.

:Two different modifications to the source code need to be implemented.

:*The first one corresponds to duplicating some or all of the program variables to introduce data redundancy, and modifying all the operators to manage the introduced replica of the variables.

:*The second modification introduces consistency checks in the control flow, so that consistency between the two copies of each variable is verified.

When the data is read out, the two sets of data are compared. A disturbance is detected if the two data sets are not equal. An error can be reported. If both sets of data are corrupted, a significant error can be reported and the system can react accordingly.

In most cases, safety-critical applications have strict constraints in terms of memory occupation and system performance. The duplication of the whole set of variables and the introduction of a consistency check before every read operation represent the optimum choice from the fault coverage point of view. Duplication of the whole set of variables enables an extremely high percentage of faults to be covered by this software redundancy technique. On the other side, by duplicating a lower percentage of variables one can trade off the obtained fault coverage with the CPU time overhead.
[[Image:Time Overhead.png|thumbnail|center|500px|An experimental analysis of CPU time overhead and the amount of duplicated variables]]
The experimental result shows that duplicating only 50% of the variables is enough to cover 85% of faults with a CPU time overhead of just 28%.

Attention should also be paid to the implementation of the consistency check, as it is usually carried out after each read operation or at the end of each variable's life period. Carefully implementing this check can minimize the CPU time and code size for this application.

[[Image:Function Parameter Duplication.png|thumbnail|right|300px|C sample code: function parameter duplication]]
[[Image:Test Condition Duplication.png|thumbnail|right|300px|C sample code: duplication of test conditions]]

*'''Function parameter duplication'''

As the detection of errors in data is achieved through duplicating all variables and adding consistency checks after every read operation, special considerations have to be applied according to the procedure interfaces. Parameters passed to procedures, as well as return values, are considered to be variables. Hence, every procedure parameter is duplicated, as well as the return values. A procedure is still called only once, but it returns two results, which must hold the same value. The source listing to the right shows a sample implementation of function parameter duplication.

*'''Test duplication'''

To duplicate a test is one of the most robust methods that exists for generic soft error detection. A drawback is that no strict assumption on the cause of the errors (EMI, ESD etc.), nor on the type of errors to expect (errors affecting the control flow, errors affecting data etc.) can be made. Erroneous bit-changes in data-bytes while stored in memory, cache, register, or transmitted on a bus are known. These data-bytes could be operation codes (instructions), memory addresses, or data. Thus, this method is able to detect a wide range of faults, and is not limited to a specific fault model. Using this method, memory increases about four times, and execution time is about 2.5 times as long as the same program without test duplication. Source listing to the right shows a sample implementation of the duplication of test conditions.

*'''Branching duplication'''

[[Image:Brunch Duplication.png|thumbnail|left|500px|Branch duplication]]
Compared to test duplication, where one condition is cross-checked, with branching duplication the condition is duplicated.

For every conditional test in the program, the condition and the resulting jump should be reevaluated, as shown in the figure. Only if the condition is met again, the jump is executed, else an error has occurred.

*'''Instruction duplication and diversity in implementation'''

What is the benefit of when data, tests, and branches are duplicated when the calculated result is incorrect? One solution is to duplicate an instruction entirely, but implement them differently. So two different programs with the same functionality, but with different sets of data and different implementations are executed. Their outputs are compared, and must be equal. This method covers not just bit-flips or processor faults but also programming errors (bugs). If it is intended to especially handle hardware (CPU) faults, the software can be implemented using different parts of the hardware; for example, one implementation uses a hardware multiply and the other implementation multiplies by shifting or adding. This causes a significant overhead (more than a factor of two for the size of the code). On the other hand, the results are outstandingly accurate.

===Ports===

====Reset ports and interrupt ports====
[[Reset port]]s and interrupts are very important, as they can be triggered by rising/falling edges or high/low potential at the interrupt port. Transient disturbances can lead to unwanted resets or trigger interrupts, and thus cause the entire system to crash. For every triggered interrupt, the instruction pointer is saved on the stack, and the stack pointer is decremented.

Try to reduce the amount of [[Interrupt#Edge-triggered|edge triggered interrupt]]s. If interrupts can be triggered only with a level, then this helps to ensure that noise on an interrupt pin will not cause an undesired operation. It must be kept in mind that level-triggered interrupts can lead to repeated interrupts as long as the level stays high. In the implementation, this characteristic must be considered; repeated unwanted interrupts must be disabled in the ISR. If this is not possible, then on immediate entry of an edge-triggered interrupt, a software check on the pin to determine if the level is correct should suffice.

For all unused interrupts, an error-handling routine has to be implemented to keep the system in a defined state after an unintended interrupt.

Unintentional resets disturb the correct program execution, and are not acceptable for extensive applications or safety-critical systems.

====Reset differentiation (cold/warm start)====
A frequent system requirement is the automatic resumption of work after a disturbance/disruption. It can be useful to record the state of a system at shut down and to save the data in a non-volatile memory. At startup the system can evaluate if the system restarts due to disturbance or failure (warm start), and the system status can be restored or an error can be indicated. In case of a cold start, the saved data in the memory can be considered valid.

====External current consumption measurement====
[[Image:Detection Power Supply Fluctuation.png|thumbnail|right|350px|Hard- and software combination: detection of power supply fluctuation using an AD-converter]]
This method is a combination of hard- and software implementations. It proposes a simple circuit to detect an electromagnetic interference using the device's own resources. Most microcontrollers, like the ATmega16, integrate analog to digital converters (ADCs), which could be used to detect unusual power supply fluctuations caused by interferences.

When an interference is detected by the software, the microcontroller could enter a safe state while waiting for the aggression to pass. During this safe state, no critical executions are allowed. The graphic presents how interference detection can be performed. This technique can easily be used with any microcontroller that features an AD-converter.

===Watchdog===
{{main|Watchdog timer}}
A watchdog timer is an electronic timer that detects abnormal operation of other components and initiates corrective action to restore normal operation. It especially ensures that microcontroller controlled devices do not completely fail if a software error or momentary hardware error occurs. Watchdog timers are typically based on either a [[monostable]] timer or digital counter. The timer circuit may be integrated on the microcontroller chip or be implemented as an external circuit. Watchdog timers can significantly improve the reliability of a microcontroller in an electromagnetically-influenced environment.

The software informs the watchdog at regular intervals that it is still working properly. If the watchdog is not informed, it means that the software is not working as specified any more. Then the watchdog resets the system to a defined state. During the reset, the device is not able to process data and does not react to calls.

As the strategy to reset the watchdog timer is very important, two requirements have to be attended:

*The watchdog may only be reset if all routines work properly.
*The reset must be executed as quickly as possible.

Simple activation of the watchdog and regular resets of the timer do not make optimal use of a watchdog. For best results, the refresh cycle of the timer must be set as short as possible and called from the main function, so a reset can be performed before damage is caused or an error occurred. If a microcontroller does not have an internal watchdog, a similar functionality can be implemented by the use of a timer interrupt or an external device.

===Brown-out===
A [[Brownout (electricity)|brown-out]] circuit monitors the VCC level during operation by comparing it to a fixed trigger level. When VCC drops below the trigger level, the brown-out reset is immediately activated. When VCC rises again, the MCU is restarted after a certain delay.

Some of the main internet providers are PTK, IPKO, [[Kujtesa]] and Artmotion &lt;ref name=ICTProfile&gt;{{cite web | title=Analysis of ICT industry in Kosovo. | url=http://www.esicenter.bg/content/EN/library/ICT%20sector%20analysis_Kosovo_v1.pdf | accessdate=2013-02-16| year=2011 | format=PDF | publisher=Kosovo Economic development through quality and networking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
First ICT companies in Kosovo can be found as early 1984, these companies where mainly focused on [[radio]] [[telecommunication]] and audio-video systems, while in early and mid '90s more companies were created, mainly specializing in [[personal computer]] sales. ICT industry in Kosovo boomed after 1999 with a lot of new companies being created,&lt;ref name="STIKKBC" /&gt; among which IPKO which now one of the major [[telecommunication]] providers and one of the biggest foreign investments in Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Telekom Slovenije buys 75% of Kosovo ISP | url=http://www.telegeography.com/products/commsupdate/articles/2006/05/30/telekom-slovenije-buys-75-of-kosovan-isp/ | accessdate=2013-02-18 | year=2006 | publisher=telegeography.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobile Telephony===
In 2010, 74 percent of the population was subscribed to mobile phone services, or a total number of 1,537,164&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.art-ks.org/repository/docs/Pasqyre%20e%20tregut%20te%20telekomunikacionit%20%20K3%20-2010.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725014334/http://www.art-ks.org/repository/docs/Pasqyre%20e%20tregut%20te%20telekomunikacionit%20%20K3%20-2010.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, PTK reported growth of subscribers from 300,000 to 800,000 in less than a year.&lt;ref&gt;http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADK675.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the number was 562,000.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2151rank.html&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a large number of shops for buying used mobile phones, they are sold on the street. {{citation needed|date=January 2012}}
Also SIM unlocking shops are numerous. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
You can buy credit for your mobile phone for the nominal price of 5 Euros, but the handlers charge more for the credit, from 1 Euro more.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Two licensed [[Mobile network operator]]s are offering their services in competition with two [[MVNO]]s. The market, however, remains concentrated with the incumbent‟s mobile subsidiary controlling over 65% of the market. [[Mobile broadband]] services are not available as no UMTS licenses have been awarded. So far, there are no plans to carry out the re-farming of 900/1800&amp;nbsp;MHz bands or assign [[frequency spectrum]] for mobile broadband.&lt;ref name="CULLEN" /&gt;

{{quote|GSM-services in Kosovo are provided currently by Vala, a subsidiary of PTK, and IPKO, a company owned by Telekom Slovenije, which has acquired the second mobile operator license in Kosovo and has started operations in late 2007. Vala has over 850,000 subscribers, mostly using the pre-paid system, whereas IPKO has gained over 300,000 subscribers within just a few months.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.invest-ks.org/?cont=38&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are three virtual operators :
* [[D3 Mobile]] (virtual operator)-043 prefix&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prepaidgsm.net/en/kosovo.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Z Mobile]]  (virtual operator)-045 prefix&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prepaidgsm.net/en/kosovo.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zog Mobile]]  (Powered by IPKO)-043 prefix&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zogmobile.com/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fixed Telephony===

Fixed telephony penetration rate is among the lowest in Europe about 5 lines per 100 inhabitants in 2011, in contrast with neighboring countries and EU countries where penetration rates are 25% and 40% respectfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.art-ks.org/repository/docs/Pasqyre%20e%20tregut%20te%20telekomunikacionit%20%20K3%20-2010.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725014334/http://www.art-ks.org/repository/docs/Pasqyre%20e%20tregut%20te%20telekomunikacionit%20%20K3%20-2010.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ART" /&gt;

There are currently three licensed Fixed Telephony providers in Kosovo:

*PTK
*IPKO
*KONET (leased lines)

PTK is by far the leading provider with market share of 94.4%, IPKO has only 5.6%. Number of subscribers dropped in 2011 to 86,014 from 88,372 in 2010, marking a drop of 2,358 or 2.67% of subscriber base.&lt;ref name="ART" /&gt;

===Dialing Code===
After the breakup of [[Yugoslavia]], with dialing code 38, Kosovo used the Serbian dialing code, 381 for new and existing landlines. As mobile networks were introduced, PTK adopted the code 377 (Monaco) and IPKO adopted the code 386 (Slovenia). This situation resulted in the highly unusual simultaneous use of three international dialing codes.

In September 2012 the [[Assembly of Kosovo]] approved a resolution on replacing the various dialing codes in use with the Albanian country code 355. While this initiative draw a lot of media attention, it never saw the light of day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=+355 bashkon Kosovën me Shqipërinë | url=http://www.top-channel.tv/artikull.php?id=241750 | accessdate=2013-02-18| year=2012 | publisher=TOP Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016 after ongoing political discussions between Kosovo and Serbia, it was agreed that Kosovo would get its own country code: 383. This code is available for all mobile and fixed-line operators, all of whom were using other international telecom country code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Kosovo to get its country code, +383 | url=http://digjitale.com/kosovo-country-code-383/ | accessdate=2016-04-16| year=2016 | publisher=Digjitalel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The code 383 has now been formally assigned, and is in the process of adoption. This code was to have replaced all former codes on 15 January 2017, but the transition has yet to be complete.&lt;ref name="Phone Code Change" /&gt;

===Internet===
Total of 38 licensed companies provide internet services in Kosovo, 6 of them with direct peering towards international gateways. Number of technologies are used to provide internet to end users, most popular being the cable DOCSIS technology with 68.95% of the market, followed by 25.43% xDSL and 5.62% other technologies like FTTX and wireless.&lt;ref name="ART" /&gt;

In contrast with other countries, majority of market share is owned by private operators, with a total of 74.57%. The biggest operator being IPKO with 51.21% followed by Kujtesa with 19.08% and PTK with 25.43%.&lt;ref name="ART" /&gt;

===Internet Penetration===
Internet penetration in Kosovo is in the process of steady development due to healthy competition and mainly due to government policies and strategies adopted with the aim to reach the maturity of the neighboring countries and EU integration. [[Broadband internet access]] accounts for the majority of [[internet]] connections, with [[ADSL]], [[Cable Internet access|cable]] and [[wireless]] available.&lt;ref name="USID" /&gt;

Internet penetration in Kosovo is somewhere between 5.40%&lt;ref name="IP" /&gt; to 20.90%&lt;ref name="IP" /&gt; depending on which report you look at. This miss-balance report is attributed mainly to rural areas where internet access is not formally offered but is rather resold formally by smaller operators, though the latest study conducted by XYZ puts internet penetration in Kosovo at 72.1% which is very close to EU countries, which reported internet penetration of 73% in 2011.&lt;ref name=IP&gt;{{cite web | title=Internet penetration and usage in Kosovo | url=http://www.stikk-ks.org/images/stories/publikime/STIKK-raport_eng_email.pdf | accessdate=2013-02-24 | year=2012 | format=PDF | publisher=STIKK}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2010, the number of internet subscribers was 105,061 or 35.02% household penetration rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.art-ks.org/repository/docs/Pasqyre%20e%20tregut%20te%20telekomunikacionit%20%20K3%20-2010.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725014334/http://www.art-ks.org/repository/docs/Pasqyre%20e%20tregut%20te%20telekomunikacionit%20%20K3%20-2010.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet coverage is widespread but it experiences frequent outages.

===Digital Television===
[[Digital television transition]] is still an ongoing process in Kosovo, limiting the [[analog television]] broadcast domain to only three national channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Introduction of digital broadcasting in Kosovo and the region – strategies  | url=http://www.kpm-ks.org/materiale/dokument/1283522801.4732.pdf | accessdate=2013-02-23| year=2009 | publisher=Independent media commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this conditions all four major telecommunications companies in Kosovo now broadcast [[digital TV]] on other mediums. While IPKO and Kujtesa have chosen to reuse the existing coaxial network, PTK which offers xDSL services went for [[IPTV]], Artomotion offers digital TV to selected users in Pristina.
IPKO has recently launched an IPTV solution, tailored towards mobile customers. Currently platform is available in [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and via a web browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=IPKO prezenton TVIM - televizionon digjital ne WEB, telefona te menqur dhe tablete | url=http://www.gazetaexpress.com/?cid=1,14,104310 | accessdate=2013-02-23| year=2013 | publisher=http://www.gazetaexpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metro WiFi===

[[File:IPKO phone shop - Pristina - Kosovo.JPG|thumb|IPKO phone shop in Pristina (February 2013)]]

Due to missing [[3G]]/[[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] licenses in Kosovo, and a growing demand for mobile broadband services from subscribers, both telecommunication providers PTK and IPKO turned to [[Municipal wireless network]] (Muni Wi-Fi). Both operators cover the majority of cities around Kosovo and touristic destinations like Prekaz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=PTK launches Wi-Fi service in 60 locations of Kosovo | url=http://www.telecompaper.com/news/ptk-launches-wifi-service-in-60-locations-of-kosovo--742467 | accessdate=2013-02-24  | publisher=http://www.telecompaper.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brezovica, Kosovo|Brezovica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=IPKO: Internet WiFi falas në sheshin Nënë Tereza dhe Brezovicë | url=http://www.gazetaexpress.com/index.php/artikujt/rubrika/C112/C6/?cid=1,14,72404 | accessdate=2013-02-24  | publisher=http://www.gazetaexpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with more cities to be covered later.

===Kosovo Internet Exchange Point===

[[File:Telephone shop signage - Pristina.JPG|thumb|Internet &amp; telephone shop signage in Pristina (February 2013)]]

The Internet Exchange Point (KOSIX), the first of its kind in Kosovo, started operating on 23 June 2011, and it operates as a functional unit within Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA). Its function is to provide the ISPs operating in Kosovo, an Internet exchange point for local traffic exchange.
Valuable and continuous contributions for the implementation of this project have given: [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) offered throughout their program Kosovo Private Enterprise Program (KPEP), [[Norwegian government]] offered through Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Norwegian embassy respectively, Cisco Systems International BV, and [[Universiteti i Prishtinës|University of Prishtina]] which have offered adequate space within the buildings of Electrical and Computer Engineering Faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=About KOSIX | url=http://www.kosix.net/en-us/aboutkosix.aspx | accessdate=2013-02-18| year=2012 | publisher=KOSIX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently four national ISPs are interconnected via KOSIX, there is no cost for peering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Members KOSIX | url=http://www.kosix.net/en-us/members.aspx | accessdate=2013-02-18| year=2012 | publisher=KOSIX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economical aspects==

ICT in Kosovo consists of relatively young companies (most of them incorporated after 1999) and with predominantly small companies with less than 20 employees.  53.8 percent of ICT companies are individual business while [[limited Liability Company]] (28.6 percent). Businesses specializing in maintenance and manufacturing are purely individual, while other sub-sectors are served by a mix of individual and LLC businesses. Other forms of incorporation are rare, with 4.4 percent being [[Limited Partnership]], and 2.2 percent [[Joint-Stock Company]]. The rest (5.5) are either [[public companies]] or have the unusual status of [[NGO]]s.
Currently, the ICT companies are determined to grow and prosper within the Kosovo market, while very few companies seek expansion in markets outside Kosovo.&lt;ref name="STIKKBC"&gt;{{cite web | title=Kosovo ICT Business Catalogue | url=http://stikk-ks.org/images/stories/publikime/ICT_Business_Catalog.pdf | accessdate=2013-02-18 | year=2010 | format=PDF | publisher=STIKK}}{{unreliable source?|date=June 2013}}{{page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to TRA report, ICT industry generated €239,518,037.36, 83.19 of which is generated by Mobile network operator, 8.37% from Fix telephony operators, 7.77% from Internet service providers and 0.68% from [[leased lines]].&lt;ref name="ART"&gt;{{cite web | title=Annual Report 2011 | url=http://www.art-ks.org/repository/docs/Raporti%20Vjetor%202011%20i%20Autoritetit%20Rregullator%20te%20Telekomunikacionit1.pdf | accessdate=2013-02-20 | year=2011 | format=PDF | publisher=RAEPC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market===

The structure of the ICT market in Kosovo is diverse in the variety of activities, sales being the main activity&lt;ref name=ICT_Decoded&gt;{{cite web | title=ICT in Kosovo – a sector decoded | url=http://www.stikk-ks.org/images/stories/publikime/Demand_Supply_Survey_IQ_Consulting.pdf | accessdate=2013-02-20 | year=2010 | format=PDF | publisher=Kosovo Private Enterprise Program (KPEP)}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 62 percent of the ICT companies have reported to import goods for retail, meanwhile their exports are minimal and their market share growth is seen to be within Kosovo, and could reach as far as [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Albania]]. The average annual turnover in the sector is 250,000 Euros, with an increasing number of companies reporting turnovers in millions of Euros.&lt;ref name="ICT_Decoded" /&gt;
[[File:The structure of the ICT market in Kosovo.png|thumb|The structure of the ICT market in Kosovo]]

*Sales - 33%
*Retail Sales - 18.7%
*Maintenance and Repair - 17.6%
*Software Development - 13.2%
*Consulting - 7.7
*ISP - 7.7%
*Training - 5.5%
*Engineering Services - 4.4%

===Ownership===

The ICT sector is dominated by domestic firms. According to the survey, 80.2 percent of the respondents represented companies that are 100% domestically owned.&lt;ref name="ICT_Decoded" /&gt; Only 6.6 percent of the companies are entirely owned by foreigners. Mixed ownership is rare (3.3 percent). The other 3.3 percent that answered "Other" were either mostly owned by foreign companies or public/state-owned companies. Foreign investors are mostly present in the sub-sectors: consulting, information services, vendors, manufacturing/assembling, and retail.&lt;ref name="ICT_Decoded" /&gt;

===Size and Employment===

The majority of ICT companies is small.  More than three-quarters (77.1 percent) employ from one to twenty employees. Only a handful of the companies have more than 100 employees.  Most of the employees working in the ICT sector are male, leaving the female employees in a tiny minority. Around 19 percent of the companies do not have any female employees at all.  Over 93 per cent employ up to 10 women, 6 per cent of the firms employ between 11 and 20, and only 1.4 percent up to 30.  There is one large company which employs 230 female workers.&lt;ref name="ICT_Decoded" /&gt;

===Kosovo Association of information and technology (STIKK)===

According to statute, STIKK is a non-profit association founded and registered in accordance with the Law on Freedom of Association and Non-Governmental Organization. STIKK represents the interests of the information and communications technology of Kosova, and the interests of professionals in ITC industry.

==Educational aspects==
The increasing number of vacancies for ICT professionals in Kosovo is reflecting the increasing progress of the
industry, although thanks to the high quality of the university education of IT specialists, and the increasing interest
of young people in modern technologies, there are no signs of systematic shortages in ICT employment, except a
registered under-supply of specialists in the field of software development and programming. The number of ICT
graduates grows each year and the leader in providing the needed skills to the industry is the Faculty of Electrical
and Computer Engineering of the University of Pristina. ICT skilled professionals are also supplied by the
University for Business and Technology, the American University in Kosovo, as well as a few vocational education
providers.&lt;ref name="USID"&gt;{{cite web | title=ICT country profile | url=http://www.rciproject.com/itprofiles_files/ICT_Country_Profile-Kosovo.pdf | accessdate=2013-02-20| year=2011 | format=PDF | publisher=Regional competitiveness initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Kosovo Accreditation Agency there are currently 13 higher education institutions, public and private, accredited to offer ICT related study programs in their curricula.&lt;ref name="ICT-KOSEU"&gt;{{cite web | title=Kosovo ICT RTD technological audit report | url=http://www.ictkoseu.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/D2.1_KOSEU_ICTRTD_TECH_AUDIT2.pdf | accessdate=2013-02-18 | year=2013 | format=PDF | publisher=ICT-KOSEU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agencies===

====Regulatory Authority of Electronics and Postal Communication====
Law on Telecommunications adopted by the Assembly and promulgated by UNMIK, Regulation 2003/16,recognizes the need to improve the telecommunications sector of Kosovo, by establishing an independent regulatory agency responsible for licensing and supervising the providers of telecommunications services in Kosovo, encouraging the private sector participation and competition in the provision of services; setting standards for all service providers in Kosovo, and, establishing provisions for consumer protection.
TRA officially started operating in January 2004.
During its young development TRA went through some important milestones that represented
a very important step towards a free, competitive market which promotes the development of the information society in Kosova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Regulatory Authority of Electronic and Postal Communications | url=http://www.art-ks.org/?cid=2,28 | accessdate=2013-02-20  | publisher=RAEPC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital Divide==

[[File:Mobile phone stall - Pristina.JPG|thumb|Second-hand mobile phones for sale at a roadside stall in Pristina in 2013]]

===Age===

Due to the overly young population in Kosovo,&lt;ref name="young" /&gt; [[digital divide]] is not very notable, this phenomenon is more notable with people in their fifties and above. This problem was evident with the educational system as well, to address this Government of Kosovo organized an ECDL course for about 27000 teachers across Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ECDL for teachers| url=http://www.ecdl.org/media/13_Kosovo_Govt_Public.pdf | accessdate=2013-02-24  | publisher=http://www.ecdl.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===
The labor force in the ICT sector is dominated by men with women comprising a marginal portion (although more significant in larger companies).&lt;ref name="ICT_Decoded" /&gt;

===Location===
Most ICT firms are based in the Pristina, the economic, political, and social center of the country, where most businesses are located and where there is the highest concentration of customers,as much as 81 percent of all ICT companies have Prishtina as their head office location.  The rest are fairly evenly spread out in the regional centers: Peja, Prizren, Gjilan, Gjakova, Podujeva, and Ferizaj.&lt;ref name="ICT_Decoded" /&gt;

==Open source==

Over the years there have been a number of [[Open-source software|open source]] organizations including Albanian Linux user group (AlbaLinux). Due to lack of support, most of them are now "passive"; among the most active and successful open source groups is Free Libre Open Source Software Kosova (FLOSSK).

*'''Free Libre Open Source Software Kosova (FLOSSK)'''
FLOSSK began in March 2009 at the initiative of James Michael DuPont as a result of the desire to organize a conference on free and open software. After six difficult months and with the help of many supporters, FLOSSK organized the first conference of free and open software in Kosovo in August 2009.
Apart from the conference, FLOSSK continued to work in various activities such as organizing Software Freedom Days in different cities of Kosovo, lectures on free software throughout Kosovo, translating software, collaborating with the media to promote free software and creating local free software groups in various cities.
From the beginning, FLOSSK members and the general public learned about GNU/Linux operating system, FLOSS programs for solving everyday problems, map creation using OpenStreetMap, and met free software movement figures from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=FLOSSK | url=http://www.flossk.org/en/about | accessdate=2013-02-20  | publisher=FLOSSK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Software Freedom Kosova'''
Software Freedom Kosova Conference is an annual conference on free and open source software and related developments in knowledge, culture and mapping held in Pristina, Kosovo. It is the largest conference of its kind in the region. The conference is organised by Free/Libre Open Source Software Kosova (FLOSSK), Kosovo Association of Information and Communication Technology, Ipko Foundation and Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the University of Prishtina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Software Freedom Kosova | url=http://www.flossk.org/en/conference | accessdate=2013-02-20  | publisher=FLOSSK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outsourcing==

A case study on ICT training in Kosovo performed by CISCO Networking Academy (NetAcad) states that the educated and experienced workforce as a whole is searching higher salaries and better working conditions abroad. If graduates are not experienced, they stay for a while in Kosovo and when they have gained experience they start searching opportunities for migration.&lt;ref name=cisco&gt;{{cite web | title=Contributions of Private-sector ICT Workforce Training to Post-conflict Reconstruction: A Case Study from Kosovo | url=http://www.amchamksv.org/images/userfiles/files/5688_th01.pdf| accessdate=2013-02-22 | publisher=International Journal of Vocational Education and Training}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is exactly the findings that NetAcad case study revealed that make Kosovo a perfect ICT outsourcing country, and time difference with the USA makes it only more appealing for the U.S. market. Such is a story of 3CIS which provides highly specialized
services to major telecommunication carriers across the globe. This includes network architecture design, planning, consulting, implementation,integration and testing with a strong expertise on mobile backhauling. 3CIS also provides on-site consulting ser-
vices as well as manages and coordinates the activities in a multi-vendor environment during the life-cycle of the complete project. On top of this, 3CIS also offers Project management services that are tailored to suit client needs from initial planning to project completions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Let's outsource in Kosovo | url=http://www.amchamksv.org/images/userfiles/files/5688_th01.pdf | accessdate=2013-02-22 | year=2011 | publisher=American Chamber of Commerce in Kosovo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kosovo has made it to other markets as well, both individually as well as established companies. Sprigs is the best example of a Kosovar start-up company established in Pristina.
Anoniem is the highest-profile job to date for SPRIGS, which was founded in late 2010, by a Dutch entrepreneur, and this job was trusted to a half-dozen young Kosovar Albanian programmers, who work at computers at a repurposed apartment that now houses the technical brain trust of this IT outsourcing company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Dutch smartphone apps digitize wanted posters | url=http://www.dw.de/dutch-smartphone-apps-digitize-wanted-posters/a-15803810 | accessdate=2013-02-22 | year=2012 | publisher=www.dw.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Institute of Refrigeration''' (IIR) (also known, in French, as the '''''Institut International du Froid''''' (IIF)), is an independent intergovernmental science and technology based organization which promotes knowledge of [[refrigeration]] and associated technologies and applications on a global scale that improve quality of life in a cost effective and environmentally sustainable manner including:
* Food quality and safety from farm to consumer
* Comfort in homes and commercial buildings
* Health products and services
* Low temperature technology and liquefied gas technology
* Energy efficiency
* Use of non-ozone-depleting and low [[global warming]] refrigerants in a safe manner.

Its scientific and technology activities are coordinated by 10 commissions which are divided into five distinct sections. The Institute produces a monthly journal on refrigeration, the ''International Journal of Refrigeration'', that is published by [[Elsevier]].&lt;ref name=elsevier1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journals.elsevier.com/international-journal-of-refrigeration/ |title=Elsevier page on International Journal of Refrigeration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The staff of the International Institute of Refrigeration includes the Director General, Didier Coulomb,&lt;ref&gt;https://fr.linkedin.com/pub/didier-coulomb/8/b25/b61&lt;/ref&gt; the Scientific and Technical Information Department (STID), the Communications and Conference Development Department, the Translation Department, and the Secretariat.

== History ==
In the mid-19th century, demand for natural ice exploded during the summer months in Europe, North America and various colonies. Thanks to the advent of railways and steam ships, natural ice came onto the market. In order to meet demand, suppliers began looking for alternative ways of producing ice. [[Ferdinand Carré]] invented the [[Absorption refrigerator|absorption machine]] in 1859, then along came the [[Vapour-compression refrigeration|vapour-compression refrigerator]] that is still used today.

In order to promote the development of refrigeration technologies in a developing environment with huge economic potential thanks to this new technology, the International Institute of Refrigeration was created.
* '''October 5–10, 1908''': The 1st International Congress of Refrigeration&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iifiir.org/clientBookline/service/reference.asp?INSTANCE=EXPLOITATION&amp;OUTPUT=PORTAL&amp;DOCID=I_IFD_REFDOC_E000001&amp;DOCBASE=IFD_REFDOC_EN&amp;SETLANGUAGE=EN&lt;/ref&gt; (ICR) was held at the [[Paris-Sorbonne University]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.paris-sorbonne.fr/&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Paris]].
* '''January 25, 1909''': The International Association of Refrigeration was set up following the 1st Congress attended by participants from 35 countries.
* '''June 21, 1920''': This association was restructured and officially became the International Institute of Refrigeration.
The bylaws of the IIR as an [[intergovernmental organization]] were defined by an International Agreement signed on December 1, 1954 and an Application Protocol signed on November 20, 1956.

== Organization ==
With the use of its international network, the IIR has established an Expertise Directory and a Laboratory Directory. The IIR is a bilingual organization that works in both English and French and operates thanks to:
* the activities of its international network comprising over 500 commission members
* its benefactor, corporate and private members
* the annual contributions from its 58 member countries, which represent two-thirds of the global population.

=== Statutory bodies ===

The Commission B1 has been extremely active in IIR Working Groups, sub-commissions, IIR conferences and co-sponsored conferences and commission business meetings.

As well as being involved in IIR Working Groups on the mitigation of direct emissions of greenhouse gases in refrigeration, the Commission is equally involved in the Working Group on Life Cycle Climate Performance (LCCP) Evaluation.

Active in IIR conferences and congresses, Commission B1 similarly organises workshops in various fields such as refrigerant charge reduction in refrigerating systems. Initiatives and opportunities, such as the phase-down of high-GWP refrigerants, energy-efficient buildings and cars, transport refrigeration, food preservation, the economic importance of the refrigeration sector, the involvement of the younger generation and identifying industrial needs are all at the heart of Commission B1.

The president of Commission B1 is Prof. Carlos Infante Ferreira ([[TU Delft]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty/tnw/page/66/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Section C: Biology and food technology ====

The activities of Section C deal with the application of refrigeration technologies to life sciences and food sciences.

Commission C1 Cryobiology, cryomedicine and health products is particularly focused on the application of refrigeration technologies on various branches of medicine: cryosurgery and oncology, cryotherapy, blood, organs and tissue preservation, health products (especially vaccines and thermosensitive preparations). On the one hand, the work focusses on the biological and biochemical aspects of the effects of refrigeration on organs, tissues and treated products, and on the other hand on the applied refrigeration techniques and technologies.

Commission C2 food science and engineering is focused more particularly on the application of refrigeration technologies in the area of food sciences: preservation (refrigeration, freezing); hygiene and safety in its microbiological aspect; process (lyophilisation, cryoconcentration, cryoprecipitation, partial or total crystallisation). The work focuses on establishing a model for the transfer of heat and matter during refrigeration treatments, on the effects of refrigeration on food products, and on the evolution kinetics of products kept in cold storage. The work deals with the impact of the integrity of the cold chain on the quality of food, including in warm climate countries.

The president of Section C is Mr Jacques Guilpart (Maison du Froid Conseil).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mfconseil.fr/mfconseil/index.php/fr/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Commission C1: [[Cryobiology]], cryomedicine and health products'''
Commission C1 Cryobiology, Cryomedicine and Health Products have clearly defined objectives in cryobiology, cryomedicine and health products research; knowledge dissemination; technology transfer and education.

This Commission is truly active and participates in the various workshop series on cryoprocessing of biopharmaceuticals and biomaterials, as well as establishing innovative e-training actions concerning the Commission’s multidisciplinary needs as well as the interdisciplinary needs of the following commissions: A1 Cryophysics, Cryoengineering, A2 Liquefaction and Separation of Gases and finally C1 Cryobiology, Cyomedicine and Health Products.

The president of Commission C1 is Prof. Noboru Motomura  ([[University of Tokyo]]).

The president of Commission C2 is Dr Judith Evans (London South Bank University).

==== Section D: Storage and transport ====
Section D Storage and Transport of the IIR is involved in the controlled-temperature logistics and distribution of temperature-sensitive products, from foodstuffs to health products (medicines, vaccines, blood products, organs ...) from artwork to chemicals.

It addresses all issues of equipment and solutions for a durable cold chain from the production or manufacture, to the consumption or use of these products.

Section D thus covers the issues of storage, transportation by land, air or water, packaging, distribution and delivery of these products to the consumer, and the traceability of the cold chain.

The Section is involved in warehouse and platform equipment, devices for temperature-controlled transport, coolants or cool packs, small coolers and refrigerated containers, chillers, refrigerated furnishings, refrigerated cabinets, climate chambers, refrigerators and freezers, but also to thermometers and temperature recorders.

The cold chain involves many temperature ranges, both positive and negative, from -80&amp;nbsp;°C to + 63&amp;nbsp;°C.

The vice-president of Section D is Gérald Cavalier&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/pub/g%C3%A9rald-cavalier/22/598/74&lt;/ref&gt; (Cemafroid SNC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cemafroid.fr/index_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618172114/http://www.cemafroid.fr/index_en.htm |archivedate=2015-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Commission D1: Refrigerated storage'''
Commission D1 Refrigerated Storage deals with the storage of all products which require temperature control, such as food and pharmaceuticals. Industrial, commercial and residential storage are also taken into account so that, in cooperation with Commission D2 Refrigerated Transport, the entire cold chain is treated, from raw materials to the final product at our home. Refrigeration plays an essential role for perishable products. While the estimated capacity of refrigerated warehouses was over 500 million cubic meters worldwide in 2014, in some countries global food losses due to the lack of a cold chain are still very important and can reach as much as 20% of the global food supply. At the same time, in heavily industrialised countries, the use of commercial and domestic refrigerators accounts for up to 6% of global electricity consumption.

As a result, the Commission faces important issues in order to promote widespread, energy efficient and environmentally friendly storage systems. New refrigerants, synergies to save or exchange energy with other systems and new technologies are the main focus of its activity. One of the most important themes in these days for this Commission is energy efficiency

The president of Commission D1 is Kuniaki Kawamura (Mayekawa Mfg. Co. Ltd.)

* '''Commission D2: Refrigerated transport'''
The IIR’s Commission D2 Refrigerated Transport is extremely active. In addition to the IIR’s four yearly congress, Commission D2 participates in the IIR Conference on Sustainability and the Cold Chain, held out of synchronisation to the congress.

Every year, Commission D2 CERTE test engineers meet in a European country to discuss refrigerated transport technology and testing issues. This group subsequently advises the United Nations working party on transport of perishable foodstuffs&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unece.org/es/transport/areas-of-work/transport-of-perishable-foodstuffs/meetings-and-events/working-party-on-transport-of-perishable-foodstuffs-wp11.html&lt;/ref&gt; held each year in Geneva. Commission D2 is currently addressing the “Cold Chain for Pharmaceutical Products” and will add this to regular transport discussion and advisory topics. Commission D2 also helps to produce Informatory Notes to assist in areas of technical or regulatory difficulty.

The role of the IIR is well recognized, and in particular, the expertise of the members of Commission D2 makes an important contribution to refrigerated transport issues: reducing food wastage and minimizing emissions.

The president of Commission D2 is Richard Lawton&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/pub/richard-lawton/26/646/33b&lt;/ref&gt; (CRT Cambridge).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crtech.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Section E: Air conditioning, heat pumps, energy recovery ====
IIR Section E co-ordinates the work of the both Commissions E1 Air-Conditioning and E2 Heat Pumps and Heat Recovery.

The core activities and interests of both Commissions are strongly connected resulting in tight collaborate and jointly organised conferences.

Air-conditioning is a subject that is now more frequently addressed due to both better comfort in an increasing number of countries and the effects of global warming. Now, even countries where demand for air-conditioning during summer months was limited, due to a cooler climate, require the operation of an air-conditioning plant for longer periods. The demand of heating is nevertheless significant and the most efficient system to provide heating is undoubtedly the heat pump. No other technology can provide net primary energy savings, economic benefits to users and reduced climate impact at the same time.

Also providing a cooling effect, the heat pump is expected to be the most common solution in the future for all year round operations. The combination of these technologies, with heat recovery capable buildings or industrial plants, cooling and heating requirements can be meet in the most efficient, reliable, cost effective and environmentally friendly way.
Section E with its Commissions is made up of 101 experts.

The vice-president of Section E is Prof. Renato Lazzarin ([[University of Padua|Universita di Padova]] DTG).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gest.unipd.it/en/department/about-dtg&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Commission E1 Air Conditioning'''
Commission E1 Air Conditioning often collaborates with Commission E2 Heat pumps and Energy Recovery as they have at least one common aspect, the compressor. Both Commissions frequently work with the same equipment which is adapted according to the seasons, alternating between air conditioners and heat pumps.

The Commission is involved in various aspects of air conditioning from equipment to systems. In the last years it developed a particular focus on energy saving and sustainability, whilst maintaining good conditions of thermal comfort ranging from topics such as free cooling, solar cooling or long term energy storage. The general importance of the themes addressed by the Commission results in relevant International Conferences.

The expertise of the Commission members on the use of new refrigerants in air conditioning systems, annual comparative studies of innovative and renewable energy systems, opportunities of part load operation on air conditioning systems to limit penalties or even to gain efficiency, and on other up-to-date research fields, is valuable, not only to the scientific community but also to the multitude of air conditioning users.

The president of Commission E1 is Prof. Xianting Li ([[Tsinghua University]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/newthuen/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Commission E2: Heat pumps, energy recovery'''
Commission members are proposed by member countries then appointed by the STC following proposals from Presidents of commissions. These commission members comprise industry, university, and research-centre specialists or refrigeration practitioners.

The aim of commission E2 Heat Pumps, Energy Recovery is to promote and enhance scientific and technological knowledge in heat pump and energy recovery fields thanks to various activities such as the organization or co-sponsoring of international conferences, or the publication of books and Informatory Notes.

The president of Commission E2 is Dr Alberto Coronas (University Rovira i Virgili).

[[File:Kegeln-Kugel.jpg|right|thumb|Ninepin bowling pins and ball]]
'''{{Lang|de|Kegel}}''', or {{lang|de|kegeln}}, (German for "[[wikt:skittle|skittle]]", [[Skittles (sport)|skittles]]) is a German [[bowling]] game played in Australia, in which a player rolls a wooden or plastic ball along a smooth, hard indoor lane (German: ''{{Lang|de|Kegelbahn}}'', [[bowling alley]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tanundakegelclub.8m.com/history.htm The Official Home Page of the Tanunda Kegel Club]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707070316/http://www.tanundakegelclub.8m.com/history.htm |date=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The object of the game is to knock down the nine kegels at the other end of the lane. Kegel is based on the traditional German game of [[nine-pin bowling]] and is therefore closely related to both skittles and [[ten-pin bowling]]. It was introduced to [[South Australia]] by [[German settlement in Australia|German settlers]] in the 19th century and remains popular in areas in which many German people settled, such as the [[Barossa Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/dnutting/germanaustralia/e/traditions.htm|title=German Traditions, Influences and Leisure Activities|accessdate=June 26, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817002059/http://teachers.ash.org.au/dnutting/germanaustralia/e/traditions.htm|archivedate=August 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6172">In a general meaning a nanoflake is a flake (that is, an uneven piece of material with one dimension substantially smaller than the other two) with at least one nanometric dimension (that is, between 1 and 100&amp;nbsp;nm). A flake is not necessarily perfectly flat but it is characterized by a plate-like form or structure. There are nanoflakes of all sorts of materials.

In a more restricted meaning, in the context of solar energy, '''Nano Flakes''' are a type of [[semiconductor]] that has potential for solar energy creation as the product itself is only in the prototype phase. With its [[Crystal structure|crystalline structure]] the crystals are able to absorb light and harvest 30 percent of solar energy directed at its surface. These Nano Flakes can potentially also help out with economic and environmental problems associated with solar energy. Working on this Nano Flake Technology is Dr. Martin Aagesen at the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]] with a PhD from the Nano Science Center. When Dr. Martin Aagesen discovered and published this new idea in 2007 there was much publicity about it and sparked many people to work on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2007/12/nano-flakes-could-make-pv-more-efficient-50956.html|title = Nano Flakes Could Make PV More Efficient|website = www.renewableenergyworld.com|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; One major company that is working on these Nano structures is SunFlake which is a science company from the [[University of Copenhagen Nano-Science Center|Nano Science Center]] with Dr. Martin Aagesen as Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The funding for the Nano flakes came from Danish Venture Capital fund SEED capital and University of Copenhagen.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecoap/about-eco-innovation/good-practices/denmark/16_en|title = Nano-flake structure boosts solar cell performance - Eco-innovation Action Plan - European Commission|website = Eco-innovation Action Plan|access-date = 2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The Nano flakes have a structure that contains tiny crystals in which millions of these crystals could fit into a single square centimeter. The tiny crystals absorb the sunlight and use the solar energy to convert it to electricity. This perfect crystalline structure is why this product can revolutionize solar energy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gizmag.com/nano-technology-to-boost-solar-efficiency/8540/|title = Nano Flakes promise greater solar energy efficiency|website = www.gizmag.com|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large surface to volume ratio and the texture of the surface of this nano structure provides a larger absorption rate of the sun's light energy. Also researchers are working on trying to combine it with different semiconducting materials since the usual requirements of a need for a similar crystal structure for the carrier substrate is less stressed in the Nano flakes structure. The carrier substrate in the Nano flakes purpose is to permit growth of the nano structures and works as a contact for the Nano structures when they are actively absorbing the sun's energy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Purpose ==
Solar energy obtained from the Nano flakes can help benefit in a couple of ways. Nano flakes can potentially help lower the cost of solar energy. Also since more solar energy can theoretically be obtained from Nano flakes, their use can potentially keep the earth's environment cleaner by reducing the need for fossil fuels.

=== Cost ===
The high cost of solar energy stems from the difficulty of converting the solar energy into electricity for use, and less than 1 percent of the world's electricity comes from the sun because of this process.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Nano flakes can potentially help with the economic issues of solar energy by lowering the cost due to an easier process and a better outcome of energy. Nano flake technology can potentially make it easier to convert solar energy into electricity estimated at twice the amount that today's [[solar cell]]s can harvest. This new technology can also potentially lower the cost of solar energy because it allows for a reduction in expensive semiconducting [[silicon]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Energy loss is also potentially reduced with a shorter distance of the solar energy transportation across smaller Nano flakes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.solarcity.com/residential/benefits-of-solar-energy|title = Uncover the Benefits of Solar Energy|website = solarcity.com|access-date = 2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environment ===
Nano Flake technology can also help keep the environment cleaner as the sun as the source it produces clean pure [[sustainable energy]] that can be converted into electricity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/12/071218105420.htm|title = Nano Flakes May Revolutionize Solar Cells|website = www.sciencedaily.com|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; While fossil fuel is the primary energy source for electricity, using solar energy obtained from Nano flakes will lower dependence on fossil fuels. When fossil fuels are burned for use they release a toxic gas which has a huge impact on earth's pollution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Also the process of obtaining these fossil fuels is not good for the environment, whether it be mining for coal, drilling for oil, or [[hydraulic fracturing]] of the earth's surface to reach the oil and gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Boudet|first = Hilary|last2 = Clarke|first2 = Christopher|last3 = Bugden|first3 = Dylan|last4 = Maibach|first4 = Edward|last5 = Roser-Renouf|first5 = Connie|last6 = Leiserowitz|first6 = Anthony|date = 2014-02-01|title = "Fracking" controversy and communication: Using national survey data to understand public perceptions of hydraulic fracturing|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513010392|journal = Energy Policy|volume = 65|pages = 57–67|doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2013.10.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3691">Network documentation is a form of [[technical documentation]]. It is the practice of maintaining records about [[Computer network|networks of computers]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pluto.ksi.edu/~cyh/cis370/ebook/ch12b.htm|title=Lesson 1: Documenting a Running Network|last=|first=|date=|website=Knowledge Systems Institute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201150027/http://pluto.ksi.edu/~cyh/cis370/ebook/ch12b.htm|archive-date=1 December 2016|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentation is used to give administrators information about how the network should look, perform and where to troubleshoot problems as they occur.

== Essential Parts of Network Documentation ==
As the purpose of network documentation is to keep networks running as smoothly as possible while minimizing downtime when repairs are necessary, essential parts of network documentation include:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

*Map of the entire network to include locations of hardware and the cabling that connects the hardware
*Server information such as data on the individual servers, schedules and locations of backups 
*Software information such as current versions, dates, licensing and support
*Vendor and contractor information
*Service agreements 
*Detailed record of problems and solutions: dated along with procedures and results

Notation that helps administrators remember key details are the basics of network documentation while visual representations assist in helping administrators understand how equipment and the notation relates to one another.&lt;ref&gt;http://packetpushers.net/evolution-of-network-documentation/&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Sample-network-diagram.png|Example of a Basic [[Computer network diagram|Network Diagram]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;
A basic network diagram includes hardware and shows how it is connected. Basic diagrams include  L1/L2 drawing of the physical connectivity and layout of the network.&lt;ref&gt;http://packetpushers.net/network-documentation-best-practices-whats-important-how-to-track-it/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Network Documentation Software ==
Though network documentation can be done by hand, for larger organizations network documentation software is utilized. Software applications can include diagrams, inventory management and circuit and cable traces. Examples include Graphical Networks' netTerrain&lt;ref&gt;http://graphicalnetworks.com/netterrain-logical-2/&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Microsoft Visio]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-a-basic-network-diagram-f2020ce6-c20f-4342-84f7-bf4e7488843a|title=Create a basic network diagram - Visio|last=|first=|date=|website=Microsoft|publisher=|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417083745/https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-a-basic-network-diagram-f2020ce6-c20f-4342-84f7-bf4e7488843a?ocmsassetID=HA102748912&amp;CorrelationId=cdbe611d-4331-43f1-90fe-ec3acd71a0f6&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US|archive-date=17 April 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Docusnap, [[Gliffy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gliffy.com/examples/network-diagrams|title=UML Diagram Tool {{!}} How to Make UML Diagrams Online {{!}} Gliffy|last=|first=|date=|website=Gliffy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417101537/https://www.gliffy.com/examples/network-diagrams|archive-date=17 April 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Opnet's [[Netmapper]], and CENTREL Solutions' XIA Configuration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.centrel-solutions.com/xiaconfiguration/|title=XIA Configuration Network Documentation Tool|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

'''Nitrokey''' is an open source [[USB]] key to enable secure encryption and signing of data. The secret keys are always stored inside the Nitrokey which protects against [[malware]] (such as [[computer viruses]]) and attackers. A user-chosen PIN and a tamper-proof smart card protect the Nitrokey in case of loss and theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nitrokey {{!}} Secure your digital life|url = http://www.nitrokey.com|website = www.nitrokey.com|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Introduction {{!}} Nitrokey|url = https://www.nitrokey.com/introduction|website = www.nitrokey.com|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;The hardware and software of Nitrokey are available as [[open source]], [[free software]] and [[open hardware]] which enables independent parties to verify the security of the device. Nitrokey is supported on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[macOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Krypto-Stick verschlüsselt Mails und Daten|url = https://www.heise.de/ct/ausgabe/2016-5-News-Sicherheit-3104236.html|website = c‘t Magazin für Computer und Technik.|accessdate = 2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Krypto-Multitool|url = https://www.heise.de/ct/ausgabe/2016-10-Krypto-Stick-NitroKey-Pro-3186997.html|website = c‘t Magazin für Computer und Technik.|accessdate = 2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 2008 Jan Suhr, Rudolf Böddeker and another friend were travelling and found themselves looking to use encrypted emails in [[internet cafés]], which meant the secret keys had to remain secure against [[computer viruses]]. Some proprietary USB dongles existed at the time, but lacked in certain ways. Consequentially, they established as an [[open source]] project - Crypto Stick&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Der mit Open-Source-Methoden entwickelte Crypto-USB-Stick|url = http://www.linux-magazin.de/Ausgaben/2010/12/Magisches-Leuchten|website = Linux-Magazin|accessdate = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; - in August 2008 which grew to become Nitrokey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = GnuPG-SmartCard und den CryptoStick|url = https://www.privacy-handbuch.de/handbuch_32r.htm|website = Privacy-Handbuch|accessdate = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a spare-time project of the founders to develop a hardware solution to enable the secure usage of [[email encryption]]. The first version of the Crypto Stick was released on 27 December 2009. In late 2014 the founders decided to professionalize the project, which was renamed Nitrokey. Nitrokey's firmware was audited by German cybersecurity firm [[Cure53]] in May 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heiderich|first1=Mario|last2=Horn|first2=Jann|last3=Krein|first3=Nikolai|title=Pentest-Report Nitrokey Storage Firmware 05.2015|url=https://cure53.de/pentest-report_nitrokey.pdf|publisher=Cure53|accessdate=15 February 2016|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its hardware was audited by the same company in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nedospasov|first1=Dmitry|last2=Heiderich|first2=Mario|title=Pentest-Report Nitrokey Storage Hardware 08.2015|url=https://cure53.de/pentest-report_nitrokey-hardware.pdf|publisher=Cure53|accessdate=15 February 2016|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first four Nitrokey models became available on 18 September 2015.

== Technical features ==
Several Nitrokey models exist and the Nitrokey Pro is the flagship model. It contains the following features:
* A secure key storage to support [[OpenPGP]] (popular with individuals) and [[S/MIME]] (popular with businesses) email encryption standards. Nitrokey can also be used with various 3rd party applications such as [[TrueCrypt]] and [[VeraCrypt]] for disk encryption.
* [[One-time password]]s (which are similar to [[Transaction authentication number|TANs]] and used as a secondary security measure in addition to ordinary passwords). It supports the [[HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm]] (HOTP, &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 4226&lt;/nowiki&gt;) and [[Time-based One-time Password Algorithm]] (TOTP, &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 6238&lt;/nowiki&gt;), which are compatible with [[Google Authenticator]].
* Client Certificate Authentication is used to administrate servers securely via SSH, access Virtual Private Networks via [[OpenVPN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to secure your Linux environment with Nitrokey USB smart card|url = http://xmodulo.com/linux-security-with-nitrokey-usb-smart-card.html|website = Xmodulo|accessdate = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Password Safe stores encrypted static passwords inside the Nitrokey.

The upcoming Nitrokey Storage provides the same features as the Nitrokey Pro and additionally contains an encrypted mass storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nitrokey Storage: USB Security Key for Encryption|url = https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/nitrokey-storage-usb-security-key-for-encryption#/|website = Indiegogo|accessdate = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
* Nitrokey's secret keys are stored securely internally.
* A user-chosen PIN protects in case of loss and theft.
* Nitrokey's tamper-proof design protects it from sophisticated physical attacks.
* [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]] keys of up to 4096 bit and [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES-256]] are supported.
* It is supported for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]] and [[Linux]].
* It is compatible with many popular software like [[Microsoft Outlook]], [[Mozilla Thunderbird]], and [[OpenSSH]].
* The secure implementation of the Nitrokey is published as open source and open hardware&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nitrokey|url = https://github.com/nitrokey|website = GitHub|accessdate = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; to enable independent reviews of the [[source code]] and [[hardware layout]] and to ensure the absence of back doors and other security flaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nitrokey Storage Firmware and Hardware Security Audits|url = https://www.opentech.fund/article/nitrokey-storage-firmware-and-hardware-security-audits|website = Open Technology Fund|accessdate = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nitrokey's security is not dependent upon secret keys stored centrally with the device manufacturer.
* Nitrokey is published as [[open source software]], [[free software]], and [[open hardware]].

== Philosophy ==
Nitrokey's developers believes that proprietary systems can't provide strong security and that security systems need to be open source. For instance there have been cases in which [[National Security Agency|NSA]] intercepts security devices being shipped and implanted backdoors into it. In 2011 [[RSA Security|RSA]] was hacked and secret keys of [[RSA SecurID|securID]] tokens been stolen which allowed hackers to circumvent their authentication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = RSA Break-In Leaves SecurID Users Sweating Bullets {{!}} Security {{!}} TechNewsWorld|url = http://www.technewsworld.com/story/72100.html|website = www.technewsworld.com|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As revealed in 2010, many FIPS 140-2 Level 2 certified USB storage devices from various manufacturers could easily be cracked by using a default password.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FIPS 140-2 Level 2 Certified USB Memory Stick Cracked - Schneier on Security|url = https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/01/fips_140-2_leve.html|website = www.schneier.com|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrokey, because of being open source and because of its transparency, wants to provide high secure system and avoid security issues which its proprietary rivals were facing. Nitrokey's mission is to provide the best Open Source security key to protect the digital lives of its users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Using CryptoStick as an HSM|url = https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2013/02/13/using-cryptostick-as-an-hsm/|website = Mozilla Security Blog|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''optophone''' is a device, used by the blind, that scans text and generates time-varying chords of tones to identify letters. It is one of the earliest known applications of [[sonification]]. Dr. [[Edmund Edward Fournier d'Albe|Edmund Fournier d'Albe]] of Birmingham University invented the optophone in 1913,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=d'Albe|first=E. E.

[[Barr and Stroud]] participated in improving the resolution and usability of the instrument.&lt;ref name = "Fournier1920"&gt;{{Citation

'''Outdoor–indoor transmission class''' (OITC) is a [[International standard|standard]] used for indicating the rate of transmission of sound between outdoor and indoor spaces in a structure. It is based on the [[ASTM International|ASTM]] E-1332 Standard Classification for the Determination of Outdoor–Indoor Transmission Class. An alternative similar standard for determining the rate of [[Sound proofing|acoustic isolation]] of a separation between spaces is [[sound transmission class]] (STC).
While STC is based on a [[noise spectrum]] targeting speech sounds, OITC utilizes a source noise spectrum that considers [[Audio frequency|frequencies]] down to 80&amp;nbsp;Hz (aircraft/rail/truck traffic) and is weighted more to lower frequencies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4288">A '''radio science subsystem''' ('''RSS''') is a [[subsystem]] placed on board a [[spacecraft]] for [[radio science]] purposes. 

==Function of the RSS==

The RSS uses [[radio signal]]s to probe a [[Interplanetary medium|medium]] such as a planetary [[atmosphere]]. The spacecraft transmits a highly stable signal to [[ground station]]s, receives such a signal from ground stations, or both. Since the transmitted signal [[parameter]]s are accurately known to the receiver, any changes to these parameters are attributable to the [[Radio propagation|propagation]] medium or to the relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station.

The RSS is usually not a separate instrument; its functions are usually "[[piggybacking (data transmission)|piggyback]]ed" on the existing [[telecommunication]]s subsystem. More advanced systems use multiple antennas with [[orthogonal]] [[Antenna (radio)#Polarization|polarization]]s.

==Radio science==

[[Radio]] science is commonly used to determine the [[gravity field]] of a [[moon]] or [[planet]] by observing [[Doppler shift]]. This requires a highly stable [[oscillator]] on the spacecraft, or more commonly a "2-way coherent" [[transponder]] that [[phase lock]]s the transmitted signal frequency to a rational multiple of a received [[uplink]] signal that usually also carries spacecraft commands.

Another common radio science observation is performed as a spacecraft is occulted by a planetary body. As the spacecraft moves behind the planet, its radio signals cuts through successively deeper layers of the planetary atmosphere. Measurements of [[signal strength]] and polarization vs time can yield data on the composition and temperature of the atmosphere at different altitudes.

It is also common to use multiple [[radio frequency|radio frequencies]] coherently derived from a common source to measure the dispersion of the propagation medium. This is especially useful in determining the free [[electron]] content of a planetary ionosphere.

In [[electronics]], a '''signal trace''' on a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) is the equivalent of a [[wire]] for [[electrical conduction|conducting]] [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]]s. Each trace consists of a flat, narrow part of the [[copper]] foil that remains after etching. Signal traces are usually narrower than power or ground traces because the current carrying requirements are usually much less.

The index is a transformation technique that minimizes soil brightness influences from spectral vegetation indices involving red and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths.

The index is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{SAVI}=\frac{(\mbox{1}+\mbox{L})(\mbox{NIR}-\mbox{Red})}{(\mbox{NIR}+\mbox{Red}+\mbox{L})}&lt;/math&gt;

where L is a canopy background adjustment factor. An L value of 0.5 in reflectance space was found to minimize soil brightness variations and eliminate the need for additional calibration for different soils.
The transformation was found to nearly eliminate soil-induced variations in vegetation indices.&lt;ref name = "Huete1988"/&gt;

'''Stanford Mobile Inquiry-based Learning Environment (SMILE)''' [https://smile.stanford.edu https://smile.stanford.edu] is a mobile learning management server software designed to help students study school subject matter, develop higher order learning skills and generate transparent real-time learning analytics.&lt;ref name="gseit-smile"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gse-it.stanford.edu/research/project/smile|title=Project Overview, Stanford Mobile Inquiry-based Learning Environment|accessdate=27 September 2016|website=Office of Innovation &amp; Technology, Stanford GSE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SMILE combines a mobile-based question application for students with a management application for teachers. The technology allows students to create multiple-choice questions on mobile phones during class and share these questions with their classmates and teacher.&lt;ref name="bucknerkim"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11125-013-9269-7|title=Integrating technology and pedagogy for inquiry-based learning: The Stanford Mobile Inquiry-based Learning Environment (SMILE)|last1=Buckner|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Kim|first2=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main goal of SMILE is to develop students’ questioning skills, encourage greater student-centric activities and practices in classrooms,&lt;ref name="bucknerkim" /&gt;  and enable a low-cost mobile wireless learning environment.&lt;ref name="otl-smile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology_detail.php?ID=31042|title=Stanford Mobile Inquiry-based Learning Environment (SMILE) - PATENT|website=Stanford University Office of Technology Licensing|accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Seeds of Empowerment (Seeds), is a global non-profit 501(c)(3) organization founded in 2009 by [[Paul_Kim_(academic)|Dr. Paul Kim]]. The NGO helped develop SMILE and also pilot studies around the world using the software since 2009.&lt;ref name="seeds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seedsofempowerment.org/about-us/vision/|title=Our Vision|website=Seeds of Empowerment|accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major contribution to the initial technical design of SMILE was originated from a research study led by [[Paul_Kim_(academic)|Dr. Paul Kim]] along with his research assistants at Stanford University. The initial research study named [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6137845/?reload=true PSILAN] (PocketSchool Interactive Learning Network) investigated a portable ad-hoc network solution that can enable a multi-user interactive learning environment in areas where resources such as electricity or access to Internet is limited. This research was part of multiple projects affiliated with Stanford's major interdisciplinary research program named [http://pomi.stanford.edu/ Programmable Open Mobile Internet] backed by [https://www.nsf.gov/ National Science Foundation].

The latest developments on SMILE have been made by [https://gse-it.stanford.edu/ GSE-IT] at the Graduate School of Education of Stanford University and partnering organizations such as [http://www.edify.org/ Edify.org]. The license of the trademarks, software, hardware, and its technical design remains with the [http://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology_detail.php?ID=31042 Office of Technology Licensing] (OTL) at Stanford University.

Recently, SMILE has been listed as one of innovative tools for the schools of tomorrow by [http://educationcommission.org/ United Nations's Education Commission], chaired by [[Gordon Brown]], former Prime Minister of United Kingdom, in its 2016 report named "[http://report.educationcommission.org/report/ Learning Generation Report]"

==How it works==
[[File:A sample question developed using SMILE.jpg|thumb|A sample question developed using SMILE]]

The software allows students to generate, share, and evaluate multimedia-rich questions.&lt;ref name="bucknerkim" /&gt; The data management software gathers these responses and the time students take to respond, and saves them for the teacher to analyze. Teachers can also enter questions to test information.&lt;ref name="bucknerkim" /&gt;

Finally, the software also allows for both teamwork and competition which teachers can use to promote a classroom environment that is either collaborative or competitive, depending on what will motivate students.&lt;ref name="bucknerkim" /&gt;

===Operating modes===
SMILE has five operating modes. The facilitator chooses the mode for each activity.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Mode
! Description
|-
| Exam Mode
| Teachers post questions for students to solve, evaluate, and comment while the system presents the student performance outcome results in real-time
|-
| Brainstorming Mode
| Participants discuss, evaluate, rank, and comment open-ended questions
|-
| Open-to-close-End-Mode
| Participants generate, discuss, evaluate, comment, and rank open-ended questions and turn the selected open-ended questions into multiple-choice questions.
|-
| Student-Paced Mode
| Students generate, solve, evaluate, and discuss questions in an asynchronous manner so participants can typically participate in sessions without any time-constraint
|-
| Organizer-Paced Mode
| Organizers control different stages of sessions with specific time limits in each stage (i.e., generating, solving, evaluating, and reviewing questions).&lt;ref name="gseit-smile" /&gt;
|}

===Question ratings===
The instrument is designed to identify performance variations. It enables organizers to define five different levels of question quality. For example:&lt;ref name="gseit-smile" /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Question Difficulty
! Description
|-
| Category 1
| Students respond with minimum cognition involving simple recalls or simple arithmetic calculations
|-
| Category 2
| Students conduct a simple analysis on question types and qualities (e.g., asking questions about questions) or solve problems with simple reasoning. These questions are designed to assess if students can recognize and make distinctions between low quality questions and higher order thinking questions.
|-
| Category 3
| Students solve given problems with an intermediate level of cognition and analysis.
|-
| Category 4
| Students solve given problems with a deeper level of analysis and reasoning.
|-
| Category 5
| Students ignore distracting information and extract only accurate information to make a necessary inference. Students must formulate their own rational equation to arrive at a conclusion. 
|}

In lieu of test scores, the ratings of the questions can be used to assess learning outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SMILE (Stanford Mobile Inquiry-based Learning Environment) - Paul Kim|url=http://www.unesco.org/archives/multimedia/?s=films_details&amp;pg=33&amp;id=2958|website=UNESCO|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analyzing a student's ability to rate other student's questions can be used to determine the student's level of critical thinking skills. The process of rating questions from their peers allows the students to think about the content in a deeper way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Help Mobile Education Go Global|url=http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2013/02/28/how-to-help-mobile-education-go-global/|website=KQED MindShift|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Praxis==
SMILE is intended for a wide range of educational settings. Not only is SMILE is content-agnostic, the pedagogical model behind SMILE is to encourage the student to make critical inquiries--the hard work, the investigation--instead of being told the answers by an educator. Many successful implementations of SMILE are implemented by teachers incorporating SMILE two to three times a week. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SMILE, Your Kid is Learning|url=http://www.ewa.org/blog-educated-reporter/smile-your-kid-learning|website=Education Writers Association|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address the rapidly advancing technological age, SMILE effectively allows schools and teachers to flip the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Paul Kim: "It's time to flip the classroom"|url=http://www.wise-qatar.org/paul-kim-flipped-classrooms-stanford|website=wise ed review, Qatar Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SMILE in Elementary Classrooms===
SMILE can be used by students in an elementary classroom. Students create questions which are then solved and rated by peers. The entire process is controlled and monitored by a teacher with an activity management application. &lt;ref name="seol-sharp-kim"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seol|first1=Sunmi|last2=Sharp|first2=Aaron|last3=Kim|first3=Paul|title=Stanford Mobile Inquiry-based Learning Environment (SMILE): using mobile phones to promote student inquires in the elementary classroom|journal=Proceedings of the 2011 International conference on frontiers in education: Computer science &amp; computer engineering|date=2011|pages=270-276|url=https://gse-it.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/worldcomp11_SMILE.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the learning process, students proceed through stages of '''Make Your Question''', where students create multiple choice questions. '''Solve Questions''' aggregates the questions and sends them back to students to solve and rate on a five-point scale. '''See Results''' allows students to see the their score. &lt;ref name="seol-sharp-kim" /&gt;

The teacher has multiple features at his or her disposal. The '''Activity Flow''' window allows the teacher to activate the various stages of the activity. The '''Student Status''' window displays the current status of each student. The '''Scoreboard''' displays individual student’s responses. The '''Question Status''' window displays metadata about the question. The '''Question''' window displays the question itself and its predetermined correct answer. The '''Top Scorers''' window displays which student achieved the highest score and which question received the highest ratings. The '''Save Questions''' button allows the teacher to save the data from a given exercise to the server.&lt;ref name="seol-sharp-kim" /&gt;

===SMILE in Math Classrooms===
SMILE takes advantage of mobile devices to increase participation, engagement, and collaboration from the students. Students are creating their own math questions, including using the device's camera to take pictures of their questions. All participants have access to the questions during and after class. &lt;ref name="song-kim-karimi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Song|first1=Donggil|last2=Kim|first2=Paul|last3=Karimi|first3=Arafeh|title=Inquiry-based Learning Environment Using Mobile Devices in Math Classroom|journal=Proceedings of the Association for Education Communications and Technology, 2012. Kentucky|date=2012|pages=386-392|url=http://www.aect.org/pdf/proceedings12/2012i/12_20.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a typical SMILE activity, students go through several phases of learning. They are: Introduction and device exploration, Prompt for problems, Student grouping and generating questions, Question generation, Question solving, Result review, Reflection, and Repetition and enrichment. Song, Kim, and Karimi describe this in their 2012 paper, Inquiry-based Learning Environment Using Mobile Devices in Math Classroom. &lt;ref name="song-kim-karimi" /&gt;

===SMILE in Participatory Action Research===
SMILE can be used in participatory action research to engage participants in critical thinking and community engagement while eventually deriving solutions that are locally relevant. &lt;ref name="kim-an"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Paul|last2=An|first2=Ji-Young|title=New Evaluation Vector through the Stanford Mobile Inquiry-Based Learning Environment (SMILE) for Participatory Action Research|journal=Healthcare Informatics Research|date=2016|volume=22|issue=3|pages=164-171|url=http://synapse.koreamed.org/DOIx.php?id=10.4258/hir.2016.22.3.164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the question generation process, participants can capture images from textbooks or take photos of environmental issues to address. Once the questions are generated, they are aggregated and redistributed to the participants. The participants then go through a period of reflection, response, evaluation, and verification. &lt;ref name="kim-an"/&gt;

The process enables the participants to think beyond simple health-relevant facts. Also, SMILE leverages the collective construction of inquiries, leading to more reliable and accurate depiction of the reality as a whole. They are able to distinguish facts from opinions, verify sources, analyze cause and effect, determine faulty generalizations, and avoid oversimplification. &lt;ref name="kim-an"/&gt;

By empowering the participants to co-evaluate and reflect their own phenomena, the external researcher's role is simply to facilitate conversation.&lt;ref name="kim-an"/&gt; Examining the questions and answer choices generated by participants help researchers uncover important insights. &lt;ref name="kim-an"/&gt;

==Technology==
[[File:SMILE Plug (Marvell).jpg|thumb|SMILE Plug on Marvell hardware]]
'''SMILE Plug''' creates an ad-hoc network which enables students to engage in SMILE activities and exchange inquiries with peers in their classrooms or their own school.&lt;ref name="bucknerkim" /&gt; Participants in the SMILE Plug model must be physically present and connected to the ad-hoc SMILE WiFi network. A SMILE Plug router contains the SMILE server software, KIWIX, Khan Academy Lite, various open education resources including open education textbooks, and four different coding language school programs.&lt;ref name="gseit-smile" /&gt;

'''SMILE Global''' enables students around the world to exchange their inquiries regardless of their location.&lt;ref name="bucknerkim" /&gt; People who are interested in a particular topic (e.g., for example, 'health'), they can search the keyword and also create their own questions, respond to existing questions, or comment on questions and answer.&lt;ref name="kim-an" /&gt; The SMILE Global server is accessible in the cloud.&lt;ref name="gseit-smile" /&gt;

Both SMILE Plug and SMILE Global allow students to incorporate multimedia components in their questions: SMILE Plug uses images, and SMILE Global uses images, audio and video.&lt;ref name="bucknerkim" /&gt;

===Cost===
The cost of implementing a SMILE activity depends on the infrastructure available in the school, but at minimum costs: $80 per mobile phone (one for every 2-3 students), $300 for a notebook laptop computer, and $100 for a local router.&lt;ref name="bucknerkim" /&gt;

Because of the ubiquitous nature of mobile devices, the low barrier to entry, and the modular growth potential, mobile devices provide a low-cost, high-reward alternative to the traditional computer lab model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Paul Kim: “Es hora de voltear el aula”|url=https://innovacioneducativa.fundaciontelefonica.com/blog/2015/07/22/dr-paul-kim-es-hora-de-voltear-el-aula/|website=Fundación Telefónica|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, business leaders provided local telecom network infrastructure and equipment such as mobile devices and computers, while local educational administrators facilitated the participation of local schools and offered teacher workshops. University staff conducted research on strategies to enhance the model within the local context and NGO partners provided localized knowledge, program oversight, and project coordination. This approach brings together many stakeholders, without exhausting the limited resources of any one sector.&lt;ref name="bucknerkim" /&gt;

In 2012, the SMILE team partnered with Marvell to create SMILE Consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marvell and Stanford create SMILE Plug cloud computer, SMILE Consortium to get companies and devs to build a better education system|url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/09/18/marvell-stanford-smile-plug-smile-consortiumcloud-computer-smile-con/|accessdate=16 October 2016|website=engadget}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SMILE Plug on Raspberry Pi===
[[File:SMILE Plug (Pi + LED).jpg|thumb|SMILE Plug on Raspberry Pi]]
In 2016, the SMILE Plug was implemented on a Raspberry Pi 3. SMILE will boot in one minute when plugged into USB power. In developing countries with limited access to electricity, a USB battery pack is required. The Pi, designed for use in areas of low internet connectivity, provides a local WiFi access point. Students and teachers with mobile devices, tablets, laptops, and computers can connect to the Plug.

The Plug requires a microSD card which acts as the hard drive and local repository of the offline resources. In order to update the SMILE Plug, one will swap out the previous microSD card with a newer microSD card with updated resources.

The total cost of a SMILE Plug varies depending on the material parts used to build the device. The base price is $85, including $35 for the Raspberry Pi motherboard; $10 for a case; $40 for a 128GB Class 10 microSD card. A battery pack for 12 hours of use costs an additional $25; the LED screen an additional $40.

===SMILE Global and Natural Language Processing===
In 2017, SMILE Global will interface with a natural language processing API. The SMILE team has prepared a databank of questions pre-categorized according to the question quality rubric. The API will return a rating for each question that is submitted on SMILE Global. The immediate response and feedback will give students a chance to make improvements to their questions in real time.

The question quality rubric will allow teachers to gauge the level of learning from their students. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vander Ark |first1=Tom |title=Stanford CTO Provokes Good Questions Online (And Off) |url=http://www.gettingsmart.com/2016/12/stanford-cto-provokes-good-questions-online-and-off/ |website=Getting Smart Podcast |accessdate=4 June 2018 |ref=gettingsmart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
SMILE has reached over 25 countries, including North America, India, Argentina, Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia, Nepal, China, Uruguay, Indonesia, South Korea, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Tanzania.&lt;ref name="bucknerkim" /&gt;

===Argentina===
Students used SMILE to think critically about what it means to be an engaged citizen in their community, generating questions for their peers about such potential moral dilemmas as homelessness, suicide, stealing, and school bullying and violence. One student addressed the increasing incidence of suicide locally and asked their peers for the major cause. This revealed additional benefits of SMILE—not only is it a tool for managing student learning and assessment, it also facilitates discussions of issues that students see as important.&lt;ref name="bucknerkim" /&gt;

In 2012, the Ministry of Education in Buenos Aires looked into modifying the cell phone prohibition use in the classroom, in effect since 2006. In addition to using SMILE, educators can now create executable programs on mobile devices to help facilitate learning in the classroom. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El celular se usa cada vez más en clase para estudiar|url=http://www.clarin.com/educacion/celular-usa-vez-clase-estudiar_0_712728817.html|website=Clarin Propietario Arte Gráfico Editorial Argentino S.A|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SMILE workshops on Music, Language Arts, and Mathematics was implemented in Misiones and Talarin August 2011. By using an exploratory learning pedagogy, students were able to compose songs. The power of mobile devices to reach the last mile and the last school is most evident where electricity and internet access is not guaranteed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Los teléfonos móviles son una herramienta increíble|url=http://www.infotechnology.com/historico/Los-telefonos-moviles-son-una-herramienta-increible-20110808-0003.html|website=Infotechnology.com|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In rural settings, desktop computers may be too cumbersome and have too high of an overhead. Mobile phones and tablets, on the other hand, are portable and battery-powered, making for a flexible mobile-learning environment. One of the keys in deploying mobile technology is a focus on bringing the desired content with a strong pedagogical foundation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Los smartphones van al colegio|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1416314-los-smartphones-van-al-colegio|website=LA NACION|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
Due to the centralized nature of Chile, it is harder for education to reach the poorest areas of the country. The concept of a mobile classroom, or "pocket school," connected and tied together by a network of mobile phones, is an attempt to take advantage of the resources already available in the most underserved communities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Allô, la "smart classe" ?|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/a-la-une/article/2012/11/13/allo-la-smart-classe_1789623_3208.html|website=Le Monde|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
Students were asked to generate math questions covering a wide range of topics, from triangle angle sum theorem, to fractions, areas and diameters. Teachers were surprised at the students’ enthusiasm. They were also surprised at the students’ ability to adopt the technology by themselves and to train each other and even their teachers.&lt;ref name="bucknerkim" /&gt;

===South Korea===
SMILE Global was tested with medical students at Chungbuk National University. Criteria for high-quality questions, criteria rubrics, and examples of high- and low-quality questions were discussed with students first. This initial overview seemed to be important in promoting deep inquiry. As the students were already very experienced in using technology, they spent 60% of their time on the inquiry-making task.&lt;ref name="bucknerkim" /&gt;

==Findings==
{{Quote box
 |quote  = The pre-service teachers reported that SMILE makes student thinking visible. Younger students are better at creating higher quality questions. Older students are already used to the traditional learning model where fact-recall is the major theme of classroom activities.
 |source = ''Quote from "Preservice teachers’ uses of SMILE to enact studentgenerated questioning practices" &lt;ref name="hsu-kim"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hsu|first1=Hui-Yin|last2=Kim|first2=Paul|title=Preservice Teachers’ Uses of SMILE to Enact Student-Generated Questioning Practices.|journal=E-Learn: World Conference on E-Learning in Corporate, Government, Healthcare, and Higher Education|volume=2015|issue=1|url=https://www.learntechlib.org/p/152032/proceedings_152032.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Studies suggest that SMILE could be implemented relatively easily in a wide range of classroom settings; it was adopted by students relatively quickly; and it increased the use of inquiry-based pedagogies.&lt;ref name="bucknerkim" /&gt;

As students evaluated each other’s questions and understood which ones got higher ratings, over time they developed questions that were more conceptually difficult and of higher quality.&lt;ref name="bucknerkim" /&gt;

Teachers need an initial training period and some follow-up mentoring so they can facilitate questions.&lt;ref name="bucknerkim" /&gt; Tailoring the content of the trainings to the local environment is crucial. Without putting the benefits of SMILE into the local context, teachers and students will find no compelling reason to adopt the pedagogy. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SMILE - Stanford Mobile Inquiry-based Learning Environment|website=Swiss Contribution|url=http://ukexport.danmar-computers.com.pl/en/item/34-smile-stanford-mobile-inquiry-based-learning-environment|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, local education officials must be on board. SMILE worked best when officials, along with civil society organizations, universities, and local businesses, worked together to bring it to classrooms and supported different elements of its implementation.&lt;ref name="bucknerkim" /&gt;

===Cohesiveness of Integration===
{{Quote box
 |quote  = The most important lesson here is that the process of developing critical thinking skills is probably not too different from the process of language acquisition: It takes time and good guidance along with ample exposure.
 |source = ''Quote from "Using Technology to Teach the Art of Asking Questions" &lt;ref name="mcgivney-kim"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGivney|first1=Eileen|last2=Kim|first2=Paul|title=Using Technology to Teach the Art of Asking Questions|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/using_technology_to_teach_the_art_of_asking_questions|website=Stanford Social Innovation Review|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
The success rate of implementing SMILE is dependent on how cohesively inquiry-based pedagogy is tied to the curricula taught at a school. While SMILE can be implemented with the existing curricula (for example, with students asking simple recall math questions), it is most effective as an additional platform to foster critical thinking. This could come in the form of a regularly scheduled SMILE class each week to discuss questioning. Although many students shy away at first, repeated practice learning how to answer, rate, and create questions within a comfortable space will allow them to grow their higher-order thinking skills.&lt;ref name="mcgivney-kim" /&gt;

Higher teacher motivation, better classroom integration, and higher frequency of use are three factors that increase SMILE retention. Teachers are encouraged to help students become knowledge-holders and questioners; teachers themselves are encouraged to challenge the status quo of rote memorization inside the classroom. Though question-and-answer sessions may create uncomfortable situations where the teachers sole authority is questioned, the additional transfer of knowledge and learning happens in this discomfort and is beneficial to the student's growth.&lt;ref name="mcgivney-kim" /&gt;

===Student Engagement===
For online classrooms, SMILE helps drive student engagement with the content, the community, and the instructor. A study on pre-service teachers meeting remotely showed positive correlation in using SMILE and achieving higher levels of collaboration, higher sense of autonomy, and optimizing content relevance and authenticity.&lt;ref name="park-kim"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Kim|first2=Paul|title=A Case Study Exploring Student Engagement with Stanford Mobile Inquiry-based Learning Environment (SMILE)|journal=GLOKALde|date=October 2016|volume=2|issue=Number: 4, Article 5|url=https://www.glokalde.com/pdf/issues/8/Article5.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relationships between students and teachers changed during the SMILE workshops. Teachers were not simply transmitting information to students; rather, students were drawing on written or digital resources to formulate their own questions. The teachers played important roles in guiding students through the solutions to difficult questions, correcting any mistakes, and elaborating on student-generated questions.&lt;ref name="bucknerkim" /&gt;

===Challenges===
School and country contexts highly influence students’ initial abilities to form deep questions. In the developing world, many teachers lack adequate teacher training. Their training is often limited to content, rather than pedagogical practices. In some cases, when teachers were asked to use new technology before they were comfortable with it, their discomfort led them to stifle students’ questions. Cultural norms governing relations between adults and students, and socialization into situational authority roles, may also inhibit student questioning.&lt;ref name="bucknerkim" /&gt;

SMILE was more difficult to implement in areas where rote memorization pedagogies were typical. Some students found it hard to generate their own questions, given their previous classroom experiences with rote memorization activities.&lt;ref name="bucknerkim" /&gt;

Additionally, students with little experience manipulating smart phones took longer to understand and use the technology, but eventually adjusted after exploration.&lt;ref name="bucknerkim" /&gt;

'''Swedish Bar Systems''' is a [[Stockholm]] based supplier and distributor of a bar inventory management system specializing in [[liquor]] [[logistics]] in the [[hospitality]] industry. The system comprises hardware, software and services which is used to improve business strategies and processes. The information collected is used for research and business development and also synchronized with the establishments [[accounting]] and [[inventory]] processes to increase time management and revenue. Swedish Bar Systems currently has installations throughout [[Scandinavia]].

==History==
Founded in 2005 in Stockholm, Sweden, the company released the first bar inventory management system to use free pour spouts, able to measure the volume of liquor poured and wirelessly transfer the encoded information to a database. The pourers contain a flow [[sensor]] that measure the volume dispensed in real time, which provides an overview of the establishment inventory.

==The System==
Swedish Bar Systems manufactures and sells hardware, software and services for the liquor market. The systems hardware and software is used in the hospitality industry, which includes [[touch screen]] computers for showing and monitoring logistics. The spout measures free poured volumes and sends this information wirelessly to a receiver. The receiver collects all signals from the spouts and enters it into the database that handles the inventory.

Swedish Bar Systems provides numerous solutions for different establishments sizes, including single-entity, [[chains]], [[Chain store|franchises]] or multiple locations, including [[casino]]s, [[stadiums]], and [[cruise ships]]. Swedish Bar Systems have the ability to interface with other [[Point of sale|POS]] systems such as [[Squirrel Systems]] and [[MICROS Systems]]. To connect bars or locations into one database a local server is set up, so the information can be shown on software modules.

==Acquisitions==
Swedish Bar Systems received several million [[Swedish krona|SEK]] investments in 2006, 2007 and later 2008 they were purchased by the listed company DQE Designed Quality Entertainment on the Nordic MTF list, a [[subsidiary]] to Börse Stuttgart.&lt;ref name="sbsacquisition"&gt;{{cite press release

[[Image:Transistor Count and Moore's Law - 2011.svg|thumb|upright=2|Plot of '''transistor counts''' against dates of introduction. The curve shows counts doubling every two years, per [[Moore's law]].]]
The '''transistor count''' is the number of [[transistor]]s on an [[integrated circuit]] (IC). Transistor count is the most common measure of IC complexity, although there are caveats. For instance, the majority of transistors are contained in the [[CPU cache|cache memories]] in modern [[microprocessor]]s, which consist mostly of the same memory cell circuits replicated many times. The rate at which transistor counts have increased generally follows [[Moore's law]], which observed that the transistor count doubles approximately every two years. {{As of|2017}}, the largest transistor count in a commercially available single-chip processor is 19.2 billion&amp;mdash; [[AMD]]'s [[Ryzen]]-based [[Epyc]]. In other types of ICs, such as [[field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGAs), Intel's (previously Altera) [[Stratix|Stratix 10]] has the largest transistor count, containing over 30 billion transistors.&lt;ref name="Gazettabyte"&gt;{{cite news

Finally got some data on Stratix10 from ISSCC conference. Old extrapolation was so waaaay of (as pointed earlier).

Warning: data on Xilinx FPGAs is not accurate either. The source is page 11 in:
(http://www.xilinx.com/company/press/kits/asmbl/asmbl_arch_pres.pdf)

Transistor count of Stratix 10 is not correct. Also year 2015, they are not available yet. Planned release is Q4/2016.

== Logic functions ==
Transistor count for generic logic functions is based on static [[CMOS]] implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Jan M.

== Memory ==
[[Semiconductor memory]] is an electronic [[data storage device]], often used as [[computer memory]], implemented on integrated circuit.

We know that in order to store a single bit (which may be 1 or 0), one flip-flop is required, made of around eight transistors. Typical CMOS Static random-access memory (SRAM) consists of 6 transistors. For Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), 1T1C, which means one transistor and one capacitor structure is common. Capacitor charged or not is used to store 1 or 0. For flash memory, the data is stored in floating gate, and the resistance of the transistor is sensed to interpret the data stored. Depending on how fine scale the resistance could be separated, one transistor could store up to 3-bits, meaning eight distinctive level of resistance possible per transistor. However, the fine the scale comes with cost of repeatability therefore reliability. Typically, low grade 2-bits MLC flash is used for flash drive, so a 16&amp;nbsp;GB flash drive contains roughly 64 billion transistors.

== Parallel systems ==
Historically, each processing element in earlier parallel systems—like all CPUs of that time—was a [[serial computer]] built out of multiple chips.  As transistor counts per chip increases, each processing element could be built out of fewer chips, and then later each [[multi-core processor]] chip could contain more processing elements.&lt;ref name="kevin" &gt;

A '''turbine blade''' is the individual component which makes up the [[turbine]] section of a [[gas turbine]] or [[steam turbine]]. The blades are responsible for extracting energy from the high temperature, high pressure gas produced by the [[combustor]]. The turbine blades are often the limiting component of gas turbines.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; To survive in this difficult environment, turbine blades often use exotic materials like [[superalloy]]s and many different methods of cooling, such as internal air channels, [[boundary layer]] cooling, and [[thermal barrier coating]]s. Blade [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] is a major source of failure in steam turbines and gas turbines. Fatigue is caused by the stress induced by vibration and resonance within the operating range of machinery. To protect blades from these high dynamic stresses, friction dampers are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bhagi LK, Rastogi V, Gupta P | title=Study of corrosive fatigue and life enhancement of low pressure steam turbine blade using friction dampers | journal=Journal of Mechanical Science and Technology | year= 2017| volume=31 | pages= 17–27 | doi=10.1007/s12206-016-1203-5|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312071089_Study_of_corrosive_fatigue_and_life_enhancement_of_low_pressure_steam_turbine_blade_using_friction_dampers|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blades of [[wind turbine]]s and [[water turbine]]s are designed to operate in different conditions, which typically involve lower rotational speeds and temperatures.

==Introduction==
[[File:Turbofan operation.svg|thumb|right|Diagram of a twin spool jet engine. The high-pressure turbine is connected by a single spool to the high-pressure compressor (purple)- and the low-pressure turbine is connected to the low-pressure compressor by a second spool (green).]]
In a gas turbine engine, a single turbine section is made up of a disk or hub that holds many turbine blades. That turbine section is connected to a compressor section via a shaft (or "spool"), and that compressor section can either be [[Axial compressor|axial]] or [[Centrifugal compressor|centrifugal]]. Air is compressed, raising the pressure and temperature, through the compressor stages of the engine. The temperature is then greatly increased by combustion of fuel inside the combustor, which sits between the compressor stages and the turbine stages. The high-temperature and high-pressure exhaust gases then pass through the turbine stages. The turbine stages extract energy from this flow, lowering the pressure and temperature of the air and transfer the kinetic energy to the compressor stages along the spool. This process is very similar to how an axial compressor works, only in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;Flack, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of turbine stages varies in different types of engines, with [[Turbofan#High-bypass turbofan|high-bypass-ratio]] engines tending to have the most turbine stages.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The number of turbine stages can have a great effect on how the turbine blades are designed for each stage. Many gas turbine engines are twin-spool designs, meaning that there is a high-pressure spool and a low-pressure spool. Other gas turbines use three spools, adding an intermediate-pressure spool between the high- and low-pressure spool. The high-pressure turbine is exposed to the hottest, highest-pressure air, and the low-pressure turbine is subjected to cooler, lower-pressure air. The difference in conditions leads to the design of high-pressure and low-pressure turbine blades that are significantly different in material and cooling choices even though the [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] and [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] principles are the same.&lt;ref&gt;Flack, p. 407&lt;/ref&gt;
Under these severe operating conditions inside the gas and steam turbines, the blades face high temperature, high stresses, and potentially high vibrations. Steam turbine blades are critical components in power plants which convert the linear motion of high-temperature and high-pressure steam flowing down a pressure gradient into a rotary motion of the turbine shaft.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;Bhagi LK, Rastogi V, Gupta P (2013).[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213290213000102/pdfft?md5=1ef4531752b9f5d166d71a48a1961bed&amp;pid=1-s2.0-S2213290213000102-main.pdf Fractographic investigations of the failure of L-1 low pressure steam turbine blade]. Case Studies in Engineering Failure Analysis, 1(2), pp.72-78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment and failure modes==
Turbine blades are subjected to very strenuous environments inside a gas turbine. They face high temperatures, high stresses, and a potential environment of high vibration. All three of these factors can lead to blade failures, potentially destroying the engine, therefore turbine blades are carefully designed to resist these conditions.&lt;ref name="F429"&gt;Flack, p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt;

Turbine blades are subjected to stress from [[centrifugal force]] (turbine stages can rotate at tens of thousands of revolutions per minute (RPM)) and fluid forces that can cause [[fracture]], [[Yield (engineering)|yielding]], or [[Creep (deformation)|creep]]&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;'''Creep''' is the tendency of a solid material to slowly move or deform permanently under the influence of stresses. It occurs as a result of long term exposure to high levels of stress that are below the yield strength of the material. Creep is more severe in materials that are subjected to heat for long periods, and near the melting point. Creep always increases with temperature. From [[Creep (deformation)]].&lt;/ref&gt; failures. Additionally, the first stage (the stage directly following the combustor) of a modern turbine faces temperatures around {{convert|2500|°F|°C}},&lt;ref&gt;Flack, p. 410&lt;/ref&gt; up from temperatures around {{convert|1500|°F|°C}} in early gas turbines.&lt;ref name="koff"/&gt; Modern military jet engines, like the [[Snecma M88]], can see turbine temperatures of {{convert|2900|°F|°C}}.&lt;ref&gt;Dexclaux, Jacques and Serre, Jacque (2003). "M88-2 E4: Advanced New Generation Engine for Rafale Multirole Fighter". AIAA/ICAS International Air and Space Symposium and Exposition: The Next 100 Years. 14–17 July 2003, Dayton, Ohio. AIAA 2003-2610&lt;/ref&gt;  Those high temperatures weaken the blades and make them more susceptible to creep failures. The high temperatures can also make the blades susceptible to [[corrosion]] failures.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Finally, vibrations from the engine and the turbine itself (see [http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/fan-blade-pass-frequency-d_1137.html blade pass frequency]) can cause [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] failures.&lt;ref name="F429"/&gt;

==Materials==
A key limiting factor in early jet engines was the performance of the materials available for the hot section (combustor and turbine) of the engine. The need for better materials spurred much research in the field of alloys and manufacturing techniques, and that research resulted in a long list of new materials and methods that make modern gas turbines possible.&lt;ref name="koff"&gt;Koff, Bernard L. (2003). "Gas Turbine Technology Overview - A Designer's Perspective". AIAA/ICAS International Air and Space Symposium and Exposition: The Next 100 Years. 14–17 July 2003, Dayton, Ohio. AIAA 2003-2722.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest of these was [[Nimonic]], used in the British [[Frank Whittle|Whittle]] engines.

The development of [[superalloy]]s in the 1940s and new processing methods such as [[vacuum induction melting]] in the 1950s greatly increased the temperature capability of turbine blades. Further processing methods like [[hot isostatic pressing]] improved the alloys used for turbine blades and increased turbine blade performance.&lt;ref name="koff"/&gt; Modern turbine blades often use [[nickel]]-based superalloys that incorporate [[chromium]], [[cobalt]], and [[rhenium]].&lt;ref name="F429"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Mineral Yearbook: Rhenium|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/rhenium/myb1-2006-rheni.pdf |format=PDF| first=Michael J.|last=Magyar|publisher=United States Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from alloy improvements, a major breakthrough was the development of [[directional solidification]] (DS) and [[single crystal]] (SC) production methods. These methods help greatly increase strength against fatigue and creep by aligning [[Grain boundary|grain boundaries]] in one direction (DS) or by eliminating grain boundaries altogether (SC). SC research began in the 1960s with [[Pratt and Whitney]] and took about 10 years to be implemented. One of the first implementations of DS was with the [[J58]] engines of the [[SR-71]].&lt;ref name="koff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.machinedesign.com/mechanical/single-crystal-turbine-blades-earn-asme-milestone-status|title=Single-Crystal Turbine Blades Earn ASME Milestone Status|first=Lee S.|last=Langston|date=March 16, 2018|work=www.machinedesign.com|accessdate=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americanscientist.org/article/each-blade-a-single-crystal|title=Each Blade a Single Crystal|first=Lee S.|last=Langston|date=|work=www.americanscientist.org|accessdate=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ThermalBarrierCoating.JPG|thumb|right|A turbine blade with thermal barrier coating.]]

Another major improvement to turbine blade material technology was the development of [[thermal barrier coatings]] (TBC). Where DS and SC developments improved creep and fatigue resistance, TBCs improved corrosion and oxidation resistance, both of which became greater concerns as temperatures increased. The first TBCs, applied in the 1970s, were [[aluminide]] coatings. Improved ceramic coatings became available in the 1980s. These coatings increased turbine blade temperature capability by about 200&amp;nbsp;°F (90&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name="koff"/&gt; The coatings also improve blade life, almost doubling the life of turbine blades in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce, p. 449&lt;/ref&gt;

Most turbine blades are manufactured by [[investment casting]] (or lost-wax processing). This process involves making a precise negative die of the blade shape that is filled with wax to form the blade shape. If the blade is hollow (i.e., it has internal cooling passages), a ceramic core in the shape of the passage is inserted into the middle. The wax blade is coated with a heat-resistant material to make a shell, and then that shell is filled with the blade alloy. This step can be more complicated for DS or SC materials, but the process is similar. If there is a ceramic core in the middle of the blade, it is dissolved in a solution that leaves the blade hollow. The blades are coated with a TBC, and then any cooling holes are machined.&lt;ref&gt;Flack, p. 430-3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ceramic matrix composite]]s (CMC), where fibers are embedded in a ceramic matrix, are being developed for use in turbine blades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ihi.co.jp/var/ezwebin_site/storage/original/application/3af4d6d52f2a1d0972f2137f87e3cd8e.pdf|title = Development of CMC Turbine Parts for Aero Engines|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Takeshi, Takashi, Kuniyuki, Ken-ichi, Masato}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantage of CMCs over conventional superalloys is their light weight and high temperature capability. [[SiC/SiC Matrix Composite|SiC/SiC composites]] consisting of silicon matrix reinforced by [[silicon carbide]] fibers have been shown to withstand operating temperatures 200°-300&amp;nbsp;°F higher than nickel superalloys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20130010774.pdf|title = Evaluation of Ceramic Matrix Composite Technology for Aircraft Turbine Engine Applications|last = Halbig, Jaskowiak, Kiser, Zhu|date = June 2013|journal = 51st AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting including the New Horizons Forum and Aerospace Exposition|doi = 10.2514/6.2013-539|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GE Aviation]] successfully demonstrated the use of such SiC/SiC composite blades for the low-pressure turbine of its [[General Electric F414|F414]] jet engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ceramic Matrix Composites Allow GE Jet Engines to Fly Longer - GE Reports|url = http://www.gereports.com/post/110549411475/ceramic-matrix-composites-allow-ge-jet-engines-to/|website = GE Reports|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = GE Successfully Tests World’s First Rotating Ceramic Matrix Composite Material for Next-Gen Combat Engine   {{!}} Press Release {{!}} GE Aviation|url = http://www.geaviation.com/press/military/military_20150210.html|website = www.geaviation.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cooling==
At a constant pressure ratio, thermal efficiency increases as the maximum temperature increases. But, high temperatures can damage the turbine, as the blades are under large centrifugal stresses and materials are weaker at high temperature. So, turbine blade cooling is essential.&lt;ref name=yahya&gt;{{cite book|last=Yahya|first=S M|title=Turbines Compressors and Fans|year=2011|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education, 2010|location=New delhi|isbn=9780070707023|pages=430–433|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mYeNd_jnMvkC&amp;dq=sm+yahya&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods of cooling===
[[File:Repair process for a V2500 high-pressure turbine guide vane (10).jpg|left|thumb|Laser-drilled holes permit film cooling in this first-stage [[International Aero Engines V2500|V2500]] nozzle guide vane]]
Cooling of components can be achieved by '''air''' or '''liquid cooling'''. Liquid cooling seems to be more attractive because of high specific heat capacity and chances of evaporative cooling but there can be problem of leakage, corrosion, choking, etc. which works against this method.&lt;ref name=yahya /&gt;  On the other hand, air cooling allows the discharged air into main flow without any problem. Quantity of air required for this purpose is 1–3% of main flow and blade temperature can be reduced by 200–300&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=yahya /&gt; 
There are many techniques of cooling used in gas turbine blades; [[convection]], film, transpiration cooling, cooling effusion, pin fin cooling etc. which fall under the categories of internal and external cooling. While all methods have their differences, they all work by using cooler air (often bled from the compressor) to remove heat from the turbine blades.&lt;ref name="F428"&gt;Flack, p.428.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal cooling===

====Convection cooling====
[[File:Cooling by Convection.jpg|thumb|Blade cooling by convection]]
It works by passing cooling air through passages internal to the blade. Heat is transferred by [[Conduction (heat)|conduction]] through the blade, and then by convection into the air flowing inside of the blade. A large internal surface area is desirable for this method, so the cooling paths tend to be serpentine and full of small fins. The internal passages in the blade may be circular or elliptical in shape. Cooling is achieved by passing the air through these passages from hub towards the blade tip. This cooling air comes from an air compressor. In case of gas turbine the fluid outside is relatively hot which passes through the cooling passage and mixes with the main stream at the blade tip.&lt;ref name="F428"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B370"&gt;Boyce, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impingement cooling====
[[File:Impingement revised.jpg|thumb|Impingement]]
A variation of convection cooling, '''impingement cooling''', works by hitting the inner surface of the blade with high velocity air. This allows more heat to be transferred by convection than regular convection cooling does. Impingement cooling is used in the regions of greatest heat loads. In case of turbine blades, the leading edge has maximum temperature and thus heat load. Impingement cooling is also used in mid chord of the vane. Blades are hollow with a core.&lt;ref name="enhanced cooling" /&gt;  There are internal cooling passages. Cooling air enters from the leading edge region and turns towards the trailing edge.&lt;ref name="B370"/&gt;

===External cooling===

====Film cooling====
[[File:GaTurbineBlade.svg|thumb|left|Rendering of a turbine blade with cooling holes for film cooling.]]
[[File:Film cooling revised.jpg|thumb|Film cooling]]
Film cooling (also called ''thin'' film cooling), a widely used type, allows for higher heat transfer rates than either convection and impingement cooling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA320215 Volume 1. Performance Flight Testing Phase. Chapter 7. Aero Propulsion] page 7.122. ''[[Edwards Air Force Base#Air Force Test Center|Edwards Air Force Base, Air Force Test Center]]'', February 1991. Size: 8MB. [https://www.scribd.com/doc/19107933/USAF-Test-Pilot-School-Performance-Phase-Textbook-Volume1 mirror of ADA320315.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This technique consists of pumping the cooling air out of the blade through multiple small holes in the structure.  A thin layer (the film) of cooling air is then created on the external surface of the blade, reducing the heat transfer from main flow, whose temperature (1300–1800 [[kelvin]]s) can exceed the [[melting point]] of the blade material (1300–1400 kelvins).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.me.umn.edu/labs/tcht/measurements/what.html What is Film Cooling?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martinez, Isidoro. "[http://webserver.dmt.upm.es/~isidoro/bk3/c17/Aircraft%20propulsion.pdf Aircraft propulsion. Thermal and mechanical limitations in jet engines]" page 19. ''[[Technical University of Madrid#School of Aeronautical Engineering|Technical University of Madrid, School of Aeronautical Engineering]]'', 2015. Retrieved: April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The air holes can be in many different blade locations, but they are most often along the leading edge.&lt;ref name="F428"/&gt; A United States Air Force program in the early 1970s funded the development of a turbine blade that was both film and convection cooled, and that method has become common in modern turbine blades.&lt;ref name="koff"/&gt;
Injecting the cooler bleed into the flow reduces turbine isentropic efficiency; the compression of the cooling air (which does not contribute power to the engine) incurs an energetic penalty; and the cooling circuit adds considerable complexity to the engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Jet Engine|last = Rolls-Royce plc|publisher = Rolls-Royce plc|year = 2005|isbn = 0902121235|location = |pages = |edition = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these factors have to be compensated by the increase in overall performance (power and efficiency) allowed by the increase in turbine temperature.&lt;ref name="B7980"&gt;Boyce, p. 379-80&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cooling effusion====
[[File:Cooling by effusion.jpg|thumb|Cooling by effusion]]
The blade surface is made of porous material which means having a large number of small orifices on the surface. Cooling air is forced through these porous holes which forms a film or cooler boundary layer. Besides this uniform cooling is caused by effusion of the coolant over the entire blade surface.&lt;ref name=yahya /&gt;

====Pin fin cooling====
In the narrow trailing edge film cooling is used to enhance heat transfer from the blade. There is an array of pin fins on the blade surface. Heat transfer takes place from this array and through the side walls. As the coolant flows across the fins with high velocity, the flow separates and wakes are formed. Many factors contribute towards heat transfer rate among which the type of pin fin and the spacing between fins are the most significant.&lt;ref name="enhanced cooling"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lesley M. Wright|first=Je-Chin Han|title=Enhanced Internal Coolingof Turbine Blades and Vanes|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/coalpower/turbines/refshelf/handbook/4.2.2.2.pdf.|work=4.2.2.2 Enhanced Internal Coolingof Turbine Blades and Vanes|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transpiration cooling====
This is similar to film cooling in that it creates a thin film of cooling air on the blade, but it is different in that air is "leaked" through a porous shell rather than injected through holes. This type of cooling is effective at high temperatures as it uniformly covers the entire blade with cool air.&lt;ref name="B370"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flack, p. 428-9&lt;/ref&gt; Transpiration-cooled blades generally consist of a rigid strut with a porous shell. Air flows through internal channels of the strut and then passes through the porous shell to cool the blade.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; As with film cooling, increased cooling air decreases turbine efficiency, therefore that decrease has to be balanced with improved temperature performance.&lt;ref name="B7980"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3874">'''Turtles''' are a class of educational [[robot]]s designed originally in the late 1940s (largely under the auspices of researcher [[William Grey Walter]]) and used in [[computer science]] and [[mechanical engineering]] training. These devices are traditionally built low to the ground with a roughly hemispheric (sometimes transparent) shell and a power train capable of a very small [[turning radius]]. The robots are often equipped with [[sensor]] devices which aid in avoiding obstacles and, if the robot is sufficiently sophisticated, allow it some perception of its environment. Turtle robots are commercially available and are common projects for robotics hobbyists. 
[[File:Turtle draw.jpg|thumb|The Valiant Turtle was sold from 1983 to 2011. It was controlled by infrared]]
Turtle robots are closely associated with the work of [[Seymour Papert]] and the common use of the [[Logo programming language]] in computer education of the 1980s. Turtles specifically designed for use with Logo systems often come with pen mechanisms allowing the programmer to create a design on a large sheet of paper. The original Logo turtle, built by Paul Wexelblat at [[Bolt, Beranek and Newman|BBN]], was named "Irving" and was demonstrated at the former Muzzey Junior High in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090310020335/http://www.erzwiss.uni-hamburg.de/Sonstiges/Logo/logofaqx.htm#FAQ2 LOGO Frequently asked Questions (FAQ): What was the genesis of Logo?] University of Hamburg, archived March 10 2009 from [http://www.erzwiss.uni-hamburg.de/Sonstiges/Logo/logofaqx.htm#FAQ2 the original]&lt;/ref&gt; "Irving" contained [[Collision|bump]] sensors and could give audio feedback with a bell. The development of the robotic Logo turtle led to the use of the term to describe the [[Cursor (computers)|cursor]] in video screen implementations of the language and its [[turtle graphics]] package.

[[File:carthermostat.jpg|thumb|right|Car engine wax thermostatic element]]

The '''wax thermostatic element''' was invented in 1934 by [[Sergius Vernet]] (1899–1968).&lt;ref&gt;Vernet, Sergius [http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=02115501&amp;PageNum=1 "Thermostat,"] U.S. Patent no. 2,115,501 (filed: 1934 October 1 ; issued:  1938 April 26).&lt;/ref&gt; Its principal application is in automotive [[thermostats]] used in the engine cooling system. The first applications in the [[plumbing]] and [[HVAC|heating]] industries were in [[Sweden]] (1970) and in [[Switzerland]] (1971).

Wax thermostatic elements transform heat energy into mechanical energy using the [[thermal expansion]] of [[wax]]es when they melt. This [[wax motor]] principle also finds applications besides engine cooling systems, including heating system [[thermostatic radiator valve]]s, plumbing, industrial, and [[agriculture]].

==Automotive thermostats==
The [[internal combustion engine]] cooling thermostat maintains the temperature of the engine near its optimum [[operating temperature]] by regulating the flow of [[coolant]] to an air cooled [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]]. This regulation is now carried out by an internal thermostat. Conveniently, both the sensing element of the thermostat and its control valve may be placed at the same location, allowing the use of a simple self-contained non-powered thermostat as the primary device for the precise control of engine temperature.&lt;ref name="Bosch, Cooling, thermostat" &gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most vehicles now have a temperature-controlled electric cooling fan, ''"the unassisted air stream can provide sufficient cooling up to 95% of the time"''&lt;ref name="Bosch, Cooling, fan" &gt;{{harvnb|Bosch|Automotive Handbook|page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so such a fan is not the mechanism for primary control of the internal temperature.

Research in the 1920s showed that cylinder wear was aggravated by condensation of fuel when it contacted a cool cylinder wall which removed the oil film. The development of the automatic thermostat in the 1930s solved this problem by ensuring fast engine warm-up.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Harry Ricardo - ''Memories and machines: the pattern of my life'' Constable, London, 1968. P218&lt;/ref&gt;

The first thermostats used a sealed capsule of an organic liquid with a boiling point just below the desired opening temperature. These capsules were made in the form of a cylindrical bellows. As the liquid boiled inside the capsule, the capsule bellows expanded, opening a sheet brass plug valve within the thermostat.&lt;ref name="Autocar" &gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these thermostats could fail in service, they were designed for easy replacement during servicing, usually by being mounted under the water outlet fitting at the top of the cylinder block. Conveniently this was also the hottest accessible part of the cooling circuit, giving a fast response when warming up.

Cooling circuits have a small bypass path even when the thermostat is closed, usually by a small hole in the thermostat. This allows enough flow of cooling water to heat the thermostat when warming up. It also provided an escape route for trapped air when first filling the system. A larger bypass is often provided, through the cylinder block and water pump, so as to keep the rising temperature distribution even.&lt;ref name="Autocar" /&gt;

Work on cooling high-performance aircraft engines in the 1930s led to the adoption of pressurised cooling systems, which became common on cars post-war. As the boiling point of water increases with increasing pressure, these pressurised systems could run at a higher temperature without boiling. This increased both the working temperature of the engine, thus its efficiency, and also the heat capacity of the coolant by volume, allowing smaller cooling systems that required less pump power.&lt;ref name="Setright, Anatomy of the Motor Car, Cooling" /&gt; A drawback to the bellows thermostat was that it was also sensitive to pressure changes, thus could sometimes be forced shut again by pressure, leading to overheating.&lt;ref name="Setright, Anatomy of the Motor Car, Cooling" /&gt; The later wax pellet type has a negligible change in its external volume, thus is insensitive to pressure changes.&lt;ref name="Setright, Anatomy of the Motor Car, Cooling" /&gt; It is otherwise identical in operation to the earlier type. Many cars of the 1950s, or earlier, that were originally built with bellows thermostats were later serviced with replacement wax capsule thermostats, without requiring any change or adaption.

This most common modern form of thermostat now uses a [[wax]] pellet inside a sealed chamber.&lt;ref name="Setright, Anatomy of the Motor Car, Cooling" /&gt; Rather than a liquid-vapour transition, these use a solid-liquid transition, which for [[wax]]es is accompanied by a large increase in volume.  The wax is solid at low temperatures, and as the engine heats up, the wax melts and expands. The sealed chamber operates a rod which opens a [[valve]] when the operating temperature is exceeded. The operating temperature is fixed, but is determined by the specific composition of the wax, so thermostats of this type are available to maintain different temperatures, typically in the range of 70 to 90°[[Celsius|C]] (160 to 200°[[Fahrenheit|F]]).&lt;ref name=KE04&gt;Don Knowles, Jack Erjavec ''Basic automotive service and maintenance'' Cengage Learning, 2004 {{ISBN|1-4018-5208-4}}  page 140&lt;/ref&gt; Modern engines run hot, that is, over 80&amp;nbsp;°C (180&amp;nbsp;°F), in order to run more efficiently and to reduce the emission of pollutants.

While the thermostat is closed, there is no flow of coolant in the radiator loop, and coolant water is instead redirected through the engine, allowing it to warm up rapidly while also avoiding hot spots. The thermostat stays closed until the coolant temperature reaches the nominal thermostat opening temperature. The thermostat then progressively opens as the coolant temperature increases to the optimum operating temperature, increasing the coolant flow to the radiator. Once the optimum operating temperature is reached, the thermostat progressively increases or decreases its opening in response to temperature changes, dynamically balancing the coolant recirculation flow and coolant flow to the radiator to maintain the engine temperature in the optimum range as engine heat output, vehicle speed, and outside [[ambient temperature]] change.  Under normal operating conditions the thermostat is open to about half of its stroke travel, so that it can open further or reduce its opening to react to changes in operating conditions. A correctly designed thermostat will never be fully open or fully closed while the engine is operating normally, or overheating or overcooling would occur.

[[File:Double valve automotive thermostat.jpg|thumb|right|Double valve engine thermostat]]
Engines which require a tighter control of temperature, as they are sensitive to "Thermal shock" caused by surges of coolant, may use a "constant inlet temperature" system. In this arrangement the inlet cooling to the engine is controlled by double-valve thermostat which mixes a re-circulating sensing flow with the radiator cooling flow. These employ a single capsule, but have two valve discs. Thus a very compact, and simple but effective, control function is achieved.

The wax used within the thermostat is specially manufactured for the purpose. Unlike a standard [[paraffin wax]], which has a relatively wide range of [[carbon]] chain lengths, a wax used in the thermostat application has a very narrow range of carbon [[molecule]] chains.  The extent of the chains is usually determined by the melting characteristics demanded by the specific end application. To manufacture a product in this manner requires very precise levels of [[distillation]].

==Types of elements==

===Flat diaphragm element===
The temperature sensing material contained in the cup transfers pressure to the [[piston]] by means of the [[Diaphragm (mechanical device)|diaphragm]] and the plug, held tightly in position by the guide.  On cooling, the initial position of the piston is obtained by means of a return spring.
Flat diaphragm elements are particularly noted for their high level of accuracy, and therefore mainly used in sanitary installations and heating.

===Squeeze-push elements===
Squeeze-Push elements contain a [[synthetic rubber]] sleeve-like component shaped like the 'finger of a glove' which surrounds the piston. As the temperature increases, pressure from the expansion of the thermostatic material moves the piston with a lateral squeeze and a vertical push. As with the flat diaphragm element, the piston returns to its initial position by means of a return spring. These elements are slightly less accurate but provide a longer stroke.

==Properties ==
The stroke is the movement of the piston in relation to its starting point. The ideal stroke corresponds to the temperature range of the elements. According to the type of element, it can vary from 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm to 16&amp;nbsp;mm.

The temperature range lies between the minimum and maximum [[operating temperature]] of the element. Elements can cover temperatures ranging from -15&amp;nbsp;°C to +120&amp;nbsp;°C. Elements may move in proportion to the temperature change over some part of the range, or may open suddenly around a particular temperature depending on the composition of the waxes.

[[Hysteresis]] is the difference noted between the upstroke and down stroke curve on heating and cooling of the element. Hysteresis is caused by the thermal inertia of the element and by the friction between the parts in motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
