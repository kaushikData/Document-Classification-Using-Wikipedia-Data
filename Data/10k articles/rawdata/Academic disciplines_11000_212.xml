'''Aluminium toxicity in people on dialysis''' (or '''aluminium toxicity''') is a problem for people on [[haemodialysis]]. The dialysis process does not efficiently remove excess [[aluminium]] from the body, so it may build up over time. Aluminium is a potentially toxic metal, and [[aluminium poisoning]] may lead to mainly three disorders: aluminium-induced [[bone disease]], [[microcytic anemia]] and neurological dysfunction ([[encephalopathy]]). Such conditions are more prominently observed in people with [[chronic renal failure]] and especially in people on haemodialysis.

About 5–10&amp;nbsp;mg of aluminium enters our body daily through different sources like water, food, occupational exposure to aluminium in industries etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://carl/ |title=AB, Edward RA.

==Biography==
Born in villa ''La Gracieuse'', [[Morges]], [[Switzerland]], to Victor Forel a pious Swiss Calvinist and Pauline Morin, a French Huguenot he was brought up under a protective household. At the age of seven he began to take an interest in insects. He went to school at Morges and Lausanne before joining the medical school at Zurich.  Forel had a diverse and mixed career as a thinker on many subjects. At Zurich he was inspired by the work of Bernhard  Aloys  von  Gudden  (1824-1886). In 1871 he went to Vienna and studied under Theodor  Meynert  (1833-1892) but was disappointed by Meynert. In 1873 he moved to Germany to assist Gudden at his Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt. He improved upon various techniques in neuro-anatomy including modifications to Gudden's microtome design. In 1877 he described the nuclear and fibrillar organization of the [[Ventral tegmental area|tegmental region]] which is now known as ''Campus Foreli.''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parent|first=André|year=2003|title=Auguste Forel on Ants and Neurology|url=http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/chn/docpdf/parent_forel.pdf|journal=Can. J. Neurol. Sci.|volume=30|pages=284–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then became a lecturer at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich while also continuing his researches on ants. His first major work was a 450 page treatise on the ants of Switzerland which was published in 1874 and commended by [[Charles Darwin]]. He was appointed professor of psychiatry in 1879 at the [[University of Zurich]] Medical School. He not only ran the [[Burghölzli]] asylum there, but continued to publish papers on [[insanity]], [[prison reform]], and [[morality|social morality]]. The asylum was very poorly run with corrupt staff and poor standards before Forel took over and converted to be among the best in Europe. Forel named his home as ''La Fourmilière'' —the Ant Colony.&lt;ref&gt;Sleigh, Charlotte (2007) Six legs better : a cultural history of myrmecology. The Johns Hopkins University Press. {{ISBN|0-8018-8445-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1900 Forel was a [[eugenics|eugenicist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toolan.com/hitler/survive.html The Survival of the Fittest, Chapter II]&lt;/ref&gt; Forel suffered a [[stroke]] that paralyzed his right side in 1912, but he taught himself to write with his left hand and was able to continue his studies. By 1914 he was a good friend of the eminent [[United Kingdom|British]] [[entomologist]] [[Horace Donisthorpe]], with whom he stayed in [[Switzerland]];&lt;ref&gt;''The Entomologist's Record'', vol XXV, Nos 1-2 (1915)&lt;/ref&gt; his ardent [[socialist]] views frequently caused political arguments between the two. After hearing of the religion from his son in law Dr. Arthur Brauns (married to his daughter Martha),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Miss Martha Root |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1929 | page =8 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm | issue = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1920 he became a member of the [[Bahá'í Faith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{Quote|This is the true religion of human social good, without dogmas or priests, uniting all men on this small terrestrial globe of ours. I have become a Bahá’í.

In 1921 he received a [[Tablet to Dr. Forel|letter from `Abdu'l-Bahá]] about the differences between the mineral, vegetable, animal and human worlds, the spiritual nature of man and proofs of the existence of [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John Paul |last=Vader |year=1984 |title=For the Good of Mankind - August Forel and the Bahá'í Faith |publisher=George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |isbn= 0-85398-172-8 |pages=17–24, 70–80 |url= http://openlibrary.org/b/OL23998532M/For_the_Good_of_Mankind }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/abdul-baha/tablet-august-forel |title=‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablet to Dr. Forel |publisher=reference.bahai.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an agnostic and was strongly anti-capitalist diverging from the Bahá’í religion of today.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00381-011-1659-7|title=August Forel (1848–1931): A look at his life and work|journal=Child's Nervous System|volume=28|pages=1|year=2011|last1=Osiro|first1=Stephen|last2=Gielecki|first2=Jerzy|last3=Matusz|first3=Petru|last4=Shoja|first4=Mohammadali M.|last5=Tubbs|first5=R.

Forel married Emma Steinheil in August 1883 and they had four daughters and two sons. In 1903 Forel and his family moved to live in his home, ''La Fourmiliere'', in [[Yvorne]] near Lake Geneva. He died there on July 27, 1931 and was cremated in Lausanne
two days later.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

==Scientific work==
[[File:Le Monde Social Des Fourmis.jpg|thumb|The Social World of Ants]]
Forel's prize essay on the ants of Switzerland was published in three parts in a Swiss scientific journal, beginning in 1874.  The work was reissued as a single volume in 1900, at which time it was also translated into English.  His myrmecological five-volume magnum opus, ''Le Monde Social des Fourmis'', was published in 1923.

Forel's predilection for finding in ants the analogs of human social and political behaviors was always controversial.  In the foreword to his 1927 edition of ''British Ants: their life history and classification'', Donisthorpe opined, "I should wish ... to protest against the ants being employed as a supposed weapon in political controversy. In my opinion an entomological work is not the appropriate means for the introduction of political theories of any kind, still less for their glaring advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;''British Ants: their life history and classification'', 2nd Edition (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;  But in 1937, the work was excerpted in Sir [[John Alexander Hammerton|J.A. Hammerton]]'s ''Outline of Great Books'' with praise for its relevance to the study of human psychology and as "the most important contribution to insect psychology ever made by a single student."&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Hammerton, Outline of Great Books, New York, Wise &amp; Co. (1937), p. 470&lt;/ref&gt;

Forel realized from experiments that neurons were the basic elements of the nervous system. He found that the neuromuscular junction communicated by mere contact and did not require the anastomosis of fibres. This came to be called the ''Contact Theory of Forel''. The word "neuron" was coined by [[Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz|Wilhelm von Waldeyer]] who published  a review of the work of Forel and others in 1891. Waldeyer synthesized ideas without actually conducting any research himself and published it in ''Deutsche   medizinische Wochenschrift'' a widely read journal which made him popular. Forel was very bitter about Waldeyer's achievement of fame that it is thought to have contributed to the decline in his interest in neuroanatomy and neurology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Less controversially, Forel first described in 1877 the [[zona incerta]] area in the brain. He gave it this name as it a "region of which nothing certain can be said".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = A. | title = Untersuchungen über die Haubenregion und ihre oberen Verknüpfungen im Gehirne des Menschen und einiger Säugethiere, mit Beiträgen zu den Methoden der Gehirnuntersuchung | journal = Archiv für Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten| last1 = Forel | volume = 7| issue = 3 | pages = 393–495 | year = 1877 | doi = 10.1007/BF02041873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Marine Mammal Research Centre''' or '''AMMRC''' was established in 1996 as a co-operative centre of the [[University of Sydney]] and the [[Zoological Parks Board of New South Wales]].

The centre’s research program includes the impacts of climate change, the spatial, haul-out and foraging behaviour of [[leopard seal]]s, population monitoring of [[Antarctic]] [[marine mammals]], and the development of non-invasive techniques that will allow researchers to monitor the hormones of wild populations (whales, dolphins and seals) without having to restrain the animals.

The researchers, behavioural ecologists and veterinarians, work on projects including:
* [[Pinniped|Seals]] of the Antarctic pack ice,
* [[Cetaceans]] in the coastal waters of [[New Guinea]],
* Seal and cetacean populations in Australian waters,
* Comparing southern and northern hemisphere endangered populations of cetaceans.

The research is supported by such organisations as the (Australian) [[Defence Science and Technology Organisation]] (DSTO).

[[Image:Salsola sativa Ypey96.jpg|thumb|right|''Halogeton sativus'' is one of the plants from which '''barilla''' was made. The species was formerly classified as ''Salsola sativa''. Engraving published 1813 (Adolphus Ypey).]]
'''''Barilla''''' refers to several species of salt-tolerant ([[halophyte]]) plants that, until the 19th Century, were the primary source of [[soda ash]] and hence of [[sodium carbonate]]. The word "barilla" was also used directly to refer to the soda ash obtained from plant sources.&lt;ref&gt;
Definitions of "barilla" in ''The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1989). Definitions retrieved from the [http://www.oed.com online edition] on December 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The word is an anglicization of the Spanish word [[:es:barrilla|''barrilla'']] for [[saltwort]] plants (a particular category of halophytes).

A very early reference indicating the value placed upon soda ash in [[Catalonia]] has been given by Glick, who notes that "In 1189 the [[Poblet Monastery|monastery of Poblet]] granted to the glassblower Guillem the right to gather [[glasswort]] in return for tithe and two hundred pounds of sheet glass paid annually (The site of these glassworks, at Narola, was excavated in 1935.)."&lt;ref&gt;Glick, Thomas F. (1979).

Presumably the word "barilla" entered English and other languages as a consequence of this export trade. The main Spanish barilla species included (i) ''[[Salsola soda]]'' (the common English term '''barilla plant''' for ''Salsola soda'' reflects this usage), (ii) ''[[Salsola kali]]'', and (iii) ''[[Halogeton]] sativus'' (formerly ''Salsola sativa'').&lt;ref&gt;

''Elements of Materia Medica and Therapeutics, Vol. I'' (Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, London), p. 551. Pereira described the main species used to make barilla in different places. Thus "[[Canary Islands|Canary]] barilla is procured from ''Salsola Kali''," "[[Alicante (province)|Alicant]] barilla is obtained from ''Salsola sativa'', ''Chenopodium setigerum'', and other species," and "Of the French barillas, two only deserve notice; namely, that of [[Narbonne]], obtained from ''Salicornia herbacea'', and which yields 14-15%, ..." Online version at [https://books.google.com/books?id=KyIb0tE9COAC books.google.com].&lt;/ref&gt; Fairly recently, Pérez&lt;ref name="Perez"/&gt; has concluded that the most prominent species was likely ''Halogeton sativus''; earlier authors have tended to favor ''Salsola soda''.

The word "barilla" was also used directly to refer to soda ash from any plant source, including not only the [[saltwort]]s grown in Spain, but also [[glasswort]]s, [[mangrove]]s, and [[kelp|seaweed]].&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Juliet F. (1978). "The Nineteenth-Century Soap Industry and its Exploitation of Intertidal Vegetation in Eastern Australia ," ''The [[Australian Geographer]], Vol. 14'', pp. 38&amp;ndash;41.&lt;/ref&gt; These types of plant-derived soda ash are impure [[alkali]] substances that contain widely varying amounts of [[sodium carbonate]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), some additional [[potassium carbonate]] (also an alkali), and a predominance of non-alkali impurities.&lt;ref name="Clow52"&gt;
Clow, Archibald and Clow, Nan L. (1952). ''Chemical Revolution,'' (Ayer Co Pub, June 1952), pp. 65&amp;ndash;90. {{ISBN|0-8369-1909-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sodium carbonate, which is water-soluble, is "[[wikt:lixiviate|lixiviated]]" (extracted with water) from the ashes of the burned, dried plants. The resulting solution is boiled dry to obtain the finished barilla. A very similar process is used to obtain [[potash]] (mainly [[potassium carbonate]]) from the ashes of hardwood trees. The best Spanish barilla—prepared by master ''barrilleros''—contained about 30% Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In 1877 Kingzett described the importance of the barilla trade to Spain as follows: "So highly was the product valued, and the importance of the trade regarded, that by the laws of Spain the exportation of the seed was an offence punishable by death."&lt;ref&gt;Kingzett, Charles Thomas (1877).

Some authors indicate that "barilla" was a specific plant used for soda ash production; this usage is erroneous, but presumably corresponds to the common usage of "barilla plant" exclusively for ''Salsola soda''. Perhaps this common usage itself reflects an old error in assuming that a single plant species was used by the Spaniards for their industry. In still earlier times, the sources of soda ash and the methods of processing it were secrets that were zealously guarded.

The '''Basque Center of Applied Mathematics''' (BCAM) is a research center on applied mathematics, created with the support of the Basque Government and the University of the Basque Country. The BCAM headquarters are in Alda. Mazarredo, 14  in [[Bilbao]], the capital of the province  of [[Biscay]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] of northern [[Spain]].

==Background==
In January 2007, the Department of Education, Universities and Research of the [[Basque Government]] [http://www.hezkuntza.ejgv.euskadi.net/r43-2591/es/] set up [[Ikerbasque]], the Basque Foundation for Science, which was charged with three objectives: the attraction and recovery of front-rank, consolidated researchers; the creation of new research centers with standards of excellence, and social outreach for science. The creation and current activity of BCAM – the Basque Center for Applied Mathematics - fall within the framework of the second of these objectives.

In early 2008, [[Ikerbasque]] commissioned [[Enrique Zuazua]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieeecss.org/CSM/library/2011/oct2011/w12-PeopleinControlPart1.pdf ieeecs interview]&lt;/ref&gt; to carry out a prospective study on the viability of setting up a center for mathematical research in the Basque Country. In March, 2008, the Ikerbasque Board of Trustees decided to go ahead with the creation of such a center as part of the BERC program (Basque Excellent Research Centres), later to become known as BCAM – Basque Center for Applied Mathematics. At the same time, the first international call for submissions for posts of director, managers and scientists was made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euskadi.net/cgi-bin_k54/bopv_20?c&amp;f=20081230&amp;a=200807222 Official call of BERC Program]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euskadi.net/cgi-bin_k54/bopv_20?c&amp;f=20090724&amp;a=200904226 Official centers grantees list]&lt;/ref&gt;

The center is located in the province of [[Biscay]], given the extensive industrial fabric that the region has had traditionally as well as its current development of R+D+i activities.
BCAM was officially created as a non-profit Association on September 1, 2008, and backed by the following three institutions: Ikerbasque, the [[University of the Basque Country]] (UPV-EHU), [[Innobasque]], the Basque Foundation for Innovation and The [[Biscay]] Government.

[[File:BeltPress.svg|right|thumb|400px|Diagram of a belt filter: sludge in the '''feed hopper''' is sandwiched between two filter cloths (shown green and purple). Fluid is extracted initially by gravity, then by squeezing the cloth through rollers. '''Filtrate''' exits through a drain, while solids are scraped off into a container.]]
The '''belt filter''' (sometimes called a '''belt press filter''', or '''belt filter press''') is an industrial [[machine]], used for solid/liquid separation processes, particularly the [[dewatering]] of [[sludge]]s in the [[chemical industry]], [[mining]] and [[water treatment]]. Belt filter presses are also used in the production of [[Apple cider#Commercial production|apple juice, cider]] and winemaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.core-equip.com/catalogue/category/1465|title=Core belt filter presses designed for the apple juice, cider and winemaking industries.|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of [[filtration]] is primarily obtained by passing a pair of [[Filter (chemistry)|filtering]] cloths and belts through a system of rollers.  The system takes a [[sludge]] or [[slurry]] as a feed, and separates it into a [[filtrate]] and a solid cake.

==Applications==
The belt filter is mainly used for dewatering&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; of sludge and slurry and juice extraction from apples, pears and other fruits, as well as grapes for winemaking, etc. Belt filters are used both municipally and industrially in a range of areas including urban [[sewage treatment|sewage]] and [[industrial wastewater treatment|wastewater treatment]], metallurgy and mining, steel plants, coal plants, breweries, dyeing, tanneries, as well as chemical and paper factories.&lt;ref name=ChinaBS&gt;http://www.china-blackstone.com, Zhengzhou Black Stone Machinery Co. LTD., 2012, 1 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The applications of a belt filter are only limited to the sludges, slurry or mashed fruit that it can process. The sludges from municipal use include raw, anaerobically digested and aerobically digested sludges, alum sludge, lime softening sludge and river water silt.&lt;ref name=KSwebsite&gt;http://www.beltfilterpress.com, Komline-Sanderson, 2013,  "Belt Filter Press", Komline-Sanderson Engineering Corporation, Peapack, USA, viewed 2 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In industry, any sludge or slurry is sourced from food processing wastes, pulp and paper wastes, chemical sludges, pharmaceutical wastes, industrial waste processing sludges, and petrochemical wastes.&lt;ref name=KSwebsite /&gt; These wastes can include mixed sludge, mineral slurry, dust sediment, selected coal washing mud, biological sludge, primary sludge, and straw, wood or waste paper pulp.&lt;ref name=ChinaBS /&gt;

Some dewatering objectives include reducing the volume to reduce the transport and storage costs, removing liquids before landfill disposal, reducing fuel requirements before further drying or incineration, producing adequate material for composting, avoiding runoff and pooling when used for land applications, and optimizing other drying processes.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; Belt filters are specifically designed for each of these particular applications and feeds.

==Advantages/limitations==
There are many physical separation processes similar to the belt filter press used for dewatering, including [[centrifuge]]s, vacuum-disc filters, and the plate and frame [[filter press]]. When compared to other compression filters, belt filters use relatively lower pressures.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; Although centrifuges have lower moisture content, lower costs and simpler operations in coal tails processing,&lt;ref name=Steel&gt;Mohanty, M.K. Wang, Z. Huang, Z., Hirschi, J., 2004, ''Optimization of the Dewatering Performance of a Steel Belt Filter'', Coal Preparation Journal, 24:53 68&lt;/ref&gt; belt filters tend to make less noise and have much quicker startup and shutdown times.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;

Belt filters are considered simple and reliable, with good availability, low staffing, easy maintenance and a long life.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=KSwebsite /&gt;&lt;ref name=SLFiltration /&gt; The belt filter is most advantageous when installed such that it is open and viewable at floor level for easier adjustment and monitoring. This is of course subject to what lighting and ventilation will allow.&lt;ref name=SLFiltration /&gt;

The belt filter press is often used in wastewater treatment, and thus the odour of the feed sludge, volatile emissions and the chemicals used in treatment, may become a problem.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; One control method is to use odour-neutralizing chemicals such as potassium permanganate.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; However this only neutralizes odours and doesn’t affect any gases or chemicals involved.  Although all problems can be controlled by enclosing the filter, the enclosure reduces essential visibility and easy access to the machine for maintenance and repairs, leading to the expensive automation of the process.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt;

A belt filter press is also known for its high capacity throughput,&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; as it is designed to handle excess capacity.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; It has low initial costs&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; and low energy running costs,&lt;ref name=KSwebsite /&gt; however, if throughput is less than 4 million gallons per day, the belt filter press may be less cost efficient than liquid transport, hiring a processing facility, or utilizing non-mechanical dewatering methods such as drying beds or reed beds.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;

Belt filters are less effective at processing some feeds. Unless the feed is well mixed from a [[Anaerobic digestion|digester]], the use of belt filters will be more costly when processing a feed with varying solids content as this requires more operator attention, raising staffing costs.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; Feeds with high grease and oil content can lower the solids percentage in the cake by blinding the belt filter&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; and all feeds need to be screened to protect the belt from being damaged by sharp objects. The type of feed may also affect the washing process. The belt filter needs to be washed frequently which consumes large amount of water and time.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; Water and time wastage, as well as the associated costs can be reduced by automating the washing system and using [[effluents]].&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;

==Designs available==
Belt filter designs are crafted using manufacturer design and performance data, operating installations, pilot testing, surveys of similar plants and testing of the wastewater solids&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; to obtain a desired dewatered solid percentage from the sludge or slurry to be processed.

Belt press filters have 4 main zones: preconditioning zone, gravity drainage zone, linear compression (low-pressure) zone and roller compression (high-pressure) zone.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; Preconditioned slurry, which is flocculated and/or coagulated depending on the feed and process, is thickened in the gravity drainage zone.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; The gravity drainage zone is a flat or inclined belt where gravity drainage of free water occurs&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; The gravity drainage area is sized according to feed solid concentrations. The standard size can be used for solids concentrations of 1.5 percent or greater, but a setup with a longer drainage area or extended size should be used for 1.5 to 2.5 percent feed solids for more free water drainage before compression. For dilute sludge with feed solids of less than 1.5 percent, an independent gravity drainage belt can be used. This belt is used only in the gravity drainage area, not in the pressure zones.&lt;ref name= KSIII&gt;http://www.beltfilterpress.com, Komline-Sanderson, "GRS Series III Kompress Belt Filter Press", Komline-Sanderson, 1 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure or wedge zones use two belts, upper and lower, to sandwich the feed together,&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; but an independent gravity zone has its own separate belt, making the belt filter a three-belt system. Depending on the required conditions of the cake, belt filters can have added washing stages and, infrared, hot gas or even microwave drying stages.&lt;ref name=SLFiltration&gt;Sparks, T.,''Solid-Liquid Filtration – A Users’ Guide to Minimizing Costs and Environmental Impact; Maximizing Quality and Productivity'', Elsevier, Portland, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Belt filters are very versatile and are made to suit the sludges, slurries or mashed fruit to be processed. For a feed or treatment process which produces unpleasant odours, [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] emissions, [[pathogens]] and hazardous gases like [[hydrogen sulphide]]&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=SLFiltration /&gt; the belt filter can include fume hoods or even be completely enclosed in a gas tight housing.&lt;ref name=SLFiltration /&gt;  Due to the reduced visibility and increased corrosion associated with enclosure, the belt filter process can also be automated.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; Large filtration areas, additional rollers and a variable belt speed can be found in advanced belt press filter designs.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;

==Process characteristics==
Belt press filters are designed for solids capacity, by weight or volume, rather than wastewater flow. Solids concentration must be determined based on the concentration of primary solids in the feed and further solids that may precipitate during treatment. Solids concentration for a process will vary, thus the design must have the capacity to deal with varying feed solids concentration.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS&gt;''Biosolids Technology Fact Sheet: Belt Filter Press'', US Environmental Protection Agency, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The feed to a belt press filter depends on the type of solids, desired product and filter design. For most sludge types the feed dry solids concentration is typically in the range of 1-10%.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; The resulting dewatered sludge (or cake) dry solids concentration typically falls in the range of 12-50%.&lt;ref name=DesignIR&gt;''Design Information Report: Belt Filter Presses'', US Environmental Protection Agency, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Dilute feed solids concentration results in a cake of higher moisture content whilst a higher feed solids concentration yields an improved solids filtration rate and drier end product.&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;R. Perry, D. Green, ''Perry’s Chemical Engineers’ Handbook'', 8th edition, McGraw-Hill, 2007, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

The input to a belt press filter is generally measured as the rate of dry [[solids loading]] (mass of dry solids per time per belt width). Again, the input solids loading is dependent on the sludge type and filter media, thus there is great variation in the dry solids loading rates of operating belt press filters. Typically, lower range solids loading rates fall in the range of 40–230&amp;nbsp;kg/h/m belt width and high range solids loading rates fall in the range of 300–910&amp;nbsp;kg/h/m belt width.&lt;ref name=DesignIR /&gt; Whilst loading is important for measuring production rate, it is also important to consider the thickness of the cake that forms in the gravity drainage section. Cake thickness affects the permeability of the filtration media and the filtration rate.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; Testing for the particular sludge type must be conducted to determine the optimum cake thickness. In some cases where filtrate recovery is important, it may be necessary to introduce a cake [[washing (process)|washing]] step.

The primary objective of a belt press filter is to dewater process sludge and much of this dewatering occurs in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone can achieve a 5 to 10 percent increase in solids concentration.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; The degree of dewatering in the gravity drainage zone is greatly dependent on the type of solids, the filter media and the sludge conditioning. The dewatering achieved in the gravity drainage zone is adversely affected if the sludge is poorly spread across the belt or the residence time is insufficient.&lt;ref name=DesignIR /&gt; Sludge conditioning is the addition of chemicals to promote [[flocculation]] of particles to form a thickened sludge and to promote dewatering. Dewatering can be promoted by the addition of [[surfactant]] and flocculation is achieved via the addition of high molecular weight polymer. Flocculation is improved with optimum polymer dosage, polymer dilution and mixing. The [[pH]] of the feed slurry must also be monitored and controlled as low pH decreases flocculation.&lt;ref name=LabTechnique&gt;Richard A. Poduska P.E. Ph.D. &amp; B. H. Collins Jr., ''A simple laboratory technique for determining belt-filter press operation'', Environmental Technology Letters, 1980, 1:12, p. 547-556&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to find the optimum value for each conditioning parameter as too much polymer or mixing can have a negative impact on flocculation and greatly increase operating expenses.&lt;ref name=LabTechnique /&gt; The effects of sludge conditioning are most apparent in the gravity drainage zone which can be easily replicated on a laboratory scale where the optimum conditioning strategy can be determined.&lt;ref name=LabTechnique /&gt; For a belt press filter to be industrially viable it must be economically efficient and thus maximum throughput is desired. Without sufficient conditioning, the gravity drainage is generally the limiting process step, but with optimum dilution the limiting process step can be shifted to the compression zone.&lt;ref name=LabTechnique /&gt;

In the compression zone of a belt press filter, the filter cake is compressed between the two belts and passed over rollers to exert pressure on the cake. There is an optimum number of rollers above which a drier product is not necessarily the result. Drier product is obtained from reduced belt speed rather than increased pressing time.&lt;ref name=MunicipalSD&gt;Oliver, J. and Vaxelaire, J., ''Municipal sludge dewatering by belt filter press: effect of operating parameters'', Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotecnology, 2005, 80, p. 948-953&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall performance of a belt press filter is improved where variations in parameters such as sludge type, feed solids concentration and conditioning are minimised.&lt;ref name=DesignIR /&gt;

The efficiency of a belt press filter is often assessed based on the dry solids content of the product cake, solids recovery and lateral migration of sludge on the belt.&lt;ref name=MunicipalSD /&gt; Solids recovery is the percentage of dry solids recovered from the feed sludge. Solids recovery is dependent on the filter media which must be selected for good permeability to promote dewatering but with pore diameter sufficiently small so that solids recovery is not greatly decreased. It is important that the belt press filter has an effective belt washing section so that [[blinding(filtration)|blinding]] does not decrease the permeability of the belt.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; Solids recovery is directly related to filtrate quality and thus the filter media and process arrangement must satisfy the desired cake and filtrate qualities. Dry solids content is a measure of the degree of dewatering. The degree of dewatering is increased when the belt speed is decreased.&lt;ref name=MunicipalSD /&gt; Lowering the belt speed reduces the capacity of the process. The following correlation relates input mass flow rate to belt speed:&lt;ref name=MunicipalSD /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Q_0=m_0 s_b L_{sludge0} &lt;/math&gt;

Where Q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = mass flow rate (kg/s), m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = mass loading (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), s&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = belt speed (m/s) and L&lt;sub&gt;sludge0&lt;/sub&gt; = initial width of sludge across the belt (m). Thus to maintain industrial scale economic throughput at lower belt speed, the mass loading and width of sludge across the belt must be increased. It has been found that increasing the solids loading slightly decreases the dry solids concentration of the cake while significantly increasing the potential for sludge to overflow the belt.&lt;ref name=MunicipalSD /&gt; Lateral migration of sludge on the belt is a measure of how the sludge spreads across the width of the belt. Increased lateral sludge migration means that sludge is escaping the edge of the belt and overflowing into the filtrate. Therefore, increased lateral sludge migration negatively impacts filtrate quality and dry solids recovery.

Generally, the minimum design discharge cake thickness is 3–5&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; This ensures that the cake is thick enough to discharge and is easily removed from the belt.

==Heuristics of the design==
In order of increasing cost and decreasing product moisture the most common dewatering options are a [[Gravity separation|thickener]], [[deep bed thickeners|deep bed thickening]], belt presses and [[membrane filter presses]]. In general [[centrifuges]] and other competing technologies do not show a significant cost advantage compared to the belt press filter, for the same cake dryness. The cost of flocculant is often a major operating cost of dewatering equipment. Belt press filters in general have the lowest flocculant consumption for any of the listed processes excluding membrane filter presses and centrifuges.&lt;ref name=TailingsDT&gt;http://www.acarp.com.au/abstracts.aspx?repId=C14012, Bickert. G, "Tailings Dewatering Technologies for Australian Coal Processing Plants", Australians Coal Association Research Program, Report Number C14012 , 2004, viewed 2 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing the feed solid concentration increases the solid filtration rate, minimises cake moisture content and produces a more homogeneous cake all of which are desirable outcomes. If increasing the feed solid concentration is not practical the addition of flocculants in a pre-treatment step has a similar result. The optimum dosage level of flocculant can be found by monitoring the [[viscosity]] of the slurry.

[[Homogeneous]] cakes are desirable as if the feed slurry is too dilute the filter cake will contain higher moisture content as a result of stratification. The minimum feed concentration that results in a homogeneous cake is determined by observing a sample of the slurry. If rapid settling occurs the filter cake formed will not be homogeneous and the filtration rate is decreased.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt;

The minimum cake discharge thickness for horizontal belt press filters is in the region of 5&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt;

The choice of belt is critical to the function of the belt press filter and a wide variety of materials and weaves are available. The filter cloth for a belt press filter should be as open as possible while maintaining the desired filtrate clarity or, if precoat is used, to prevent the loss of precoat. Lighter cloths produce a clearer filtrate and do not block as rapidly however their durability and life span is significantly shorter than heavier cloths.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; Both seamless and seamed belts are available. Seamed belts wear faster at the seam and cause wear at the rollers and the doctor blade. Zipper-type and clipper-type seamed belts are also available with the zipper-type having a longer life span as they provide less discontinuity. Seamless belts have the longest life span but are more expensive. Also it should be ensured that the belt press is compatible with a seamless belt.&lt;ref name=DesignIR /&gt;

Increasing the temperature of the feed slurry decreases the viscosity of the liquid phase. This is beneficial as it increases the filtration rate and decreases the cake moisture. The same advantages can be obtained by other drying methods such as passing dry steam through the deliquored cake to raise the temperature of the remaining moisture, or other [[drying]] methods can be utilised.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt;

Cake thickness may have to be controlled or restricted when cake washing is required or the final cake moisture is a critical parameter. When cake washing time is a dominating factor the maximum filtration rate will occur when the minimum cake thickness for discharge is achieved. The time required for washing is increased by the square of the ratio of cake thicknesses. For example, if the thickness of the cake is doubled the washing time will increase roughly by a factor of 4.

==Necessary post-treatment systems==
Completely clear filtrate cannot be obtained using belt press filters except in rare circumstances. Thus further treatment may be required for the filtrate before it is reused or discharged as waste. If the filter is downstream of a [[clarifier]] or thickener the filtrate (and wash water) can be recycled back into the clarifier to reduce the required filtrate clarity and allows for the use of more durable cloths. If recycling or reuse is not an option the filtrate should be discharged subject to legislation and license requirements. Further treatment of clarified water (filtration or chemical treatment) may be required before discharge.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt;

The filter cake usually has a high enough solid concentration to allow for all types of disposal methods without further treatment including recycling back into the process, landfill/composting and incineration. The polymer content makes filter cake from a belt press filter more suited to the aforementioned disposal methods than a cake conditioned with ferric chloride and lime which can occur with other dewatering processes.&lt;ref name=DesignIR /&gt;

==Recent developments==
Significant developments in belt press filter technology include: cloth developments, using three belts and, the V-fold belt. Cloth developments include the double weave which incorporates different yarn types to combine the specific advantages of each.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; A double weave woven wire belt is also available which has a better life span and durability than a conventional wire belt.&lt;ref name=SyntheticBelts&gt;http://spirofil-averinox.com/product-groups/synthetic-woven-belts Spirofil-Averinox , 2012, "Synthetic Woven Belts &amp; Synthetic Filter Cloth", Spirofil-Averinox, viewed 2nd  October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A belt press filter using three belts can achieve independent speeds and have different belt types for the pressure and gravity zones.&lt;ref name= KSIII /&gt;&lt;ref name=BDPwebsite&gt;http://www.engamerica.com/uploaded/Doc/BDP_Belt_Filter_Press.pdf, BDP Industries, "Model 3DPTM Belt Filter Press", BDP Industries New York, USA, viewed 2 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the filter system to accommodate higher hydraulic loadings occurring with dilute feed sludge (feed solid concentration below 1.5%).  The three belt system is more efficient with both a higher production rate and cake solid concentration at the expense of mechanical complexity.&lt;ref name= KSIII /&gt;

The V-fold belt is similar to the belt filter press with the main difference being that only a single belt, folded along the centreline is used. The technology has not been widely proven. A final dry weight solids content of 9-13% can usually be achieved; this is smaller than competing technologies. Currently this technology is suited to small-scale applications (up to approximately 3000 L of slurry per hour as the maximum belt size is 0.75 m). V-fold belts have a small footprint, low energy and wash water consumption and low capital and operating costs. They are self-tracking and can process sludge of varying composition, reducing operator involvement.&lt;ref name=VFold&gt;Young. D, Ochre. P, and Kuijvenhoven.

The ubiquitinated proteins are enclosed in autophagosomes, which eventually fuse with lysosomes, leading to the degradation of the dysfunctional proteins. CASA is a vital part of the cellular protein quality control system. It is essential for protein homeostais ([[proteostasis]]) in [[neurons]] and in mechanically strained cells and tissues such as [[skeletal muscle]], [[heart]] and [[lung]].&lt;ref name="pmid23434281"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20060297"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19229298"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18094623"/&gt;

==CASA - involved components and mechanism==
The CASA complex comprises the molecular chaperones [[HSPA8]] and [[HSPB8]], and the cochaperones [[BAG3]] and [[STUB1]].&lt;ref name="pmid20060297"/&gt; BAG3 facilitates the cooperation of HSPA8 and HSPB8 during the recognition of nonnative client proteins. STUB1 mediates the [[ubiquitination]] of the chaperone-bound client, which induces the recruitment of the autophagic ubiquitin adaptor [[SQSTM1]]. The adaptor simultaneously interacts with the ubiquitinated client and autophagosome membrane precursors, thereby inducing the autophagic engulfment of the client.&lt;ref name="pmid22722335"/&gt; Autophagosome formation during CASA depends on an interaction of [[BAG3]] with [[SYNPO2]], which triggers the cooperation with a [[VPS18]]-containing protein complex that mediates the fusion of autophagosome membrane precursors.&lt;ref name="pmid23434281"/&gt; The formed autophagosomes finally fuse with lysosomes, resulting in client degradation.

==CASA - clients and physiological role==
Proteins that are degraded by chaperone-assisted selective autophagy include pathogenic forms of the [[Huntingtin]] protein, which cause [[Huntington's disease]].&lt;ref name="pmid18094623"/&gt; Furthermore, the expression of the CASA-inducing cochaperone BAG3 is upregulated in aged neuronal cells, which correlates with an increased necessity to dispose oxidatively damaged proteins through autophagy.&lt;ref name="pmid19229298"/&gt; CASA is thus essential for [[proteostasis]] in [[neurons]].

In mechanically strained cells and tissues, CASA mediates the degradation of the [[actin]]-crosslinking protein [[filamin]].&lt;ref name="pmid23434281"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20060297"/&gt; Mechanical tension results in unfolding of filamin, leading to recognition by the CASA chaperone complex and to the autophagic degradation of damaged filamin. This is a prerequisite for the maintenance of the [[actin]] cytoskeleton in mechanically strained cells and tissues. Impairment of CASA in patients and animal models causes [[muscle dystrophy]] and [[cardiomyopathy]].&lt;ref name="pmid19085932"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Selcen D, Muntoni F, Burton BK, Pegoraro E, Sewry C, Bite AV, Engel AG | title = Mutation in BAG3 causes severe dominant childhood muscular dystrophy | journal = Ann Neurol | volume = 65 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–9 |date=January 2009 | pmid = 19085932 | pmc =  2639628| doi = 10.1002/ana.21553 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16936253"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Homma S, Iwasaki M, Shelton GD, Engvall E, Reed JC, Takayama S | title = BAG3 deficiency results in fulminant myopathy and early lethality | journal = Am J Pathol | volume = 169 | issue = 3 | pages = 761–73 |date=September 2006 | pmid = 16936253 | pmc = 1698816 | doi=10.2353/ajpath.2006.060250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22366786"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sarparanta J, Jonson PH, Golzio C, Sandell S, Luque H, Screen M, McDonald K, Stajich JM, Mahjneh I, Vihola A, Raheem O, Penttilä S, Lehtinen S, Huovinen S, Palmio J, Tasca G, Ricci E, Hackman P, Hauser M, Katsanis N, Udd B | title = Mutations affecting the cytoplasmic functions of the co-chaperone DNAJB6 cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 450–5 |date=February 2009 | pmid = 22366786 | pmc =  3315599| doi = 10.1038/ng.1103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Semiotics}}
In [[semiotics]], a '''code''' is a set of [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] or sub-codes currently in use to communicate meaning. The most common is one's [[spoken language]], but the term can also be used to refer to any [[narrative]] form: consider the color scheme of an image (e.g. red for danger), or the rules of a board game (e.g. the military [[Sign (semiotics)|signifiers]] in [[chess]]).

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913) emphasised that signs only acquire [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] and [[value (semiotics)|value]] when they are interpreted in relation to each other. He believed that the relationship between the signifier and the signified was arbitrary. Hence, interpreting signs requires familiarity with the sets of conventions or codes currently in use to communicate meaning.

[[Roman Jakobson]] (1896–1982) elaborated the idea that the production and interpretation of texts depends on the existence of codes or conventions for communication. Since the meaning of a sign depends on the code within which it is situated, codes provide a framework within which signs make sense (see [[Semiosis]]).

==Discussion==
To that extent, codes represent a broad interpretative framework used by both addressers and their addressees to [[encode (semiotics)|encode]] and [[decode (semiotics)|decode]] the [[message]]s. Self-evidently, the most effective communications will result when both creator and interpreter use exactly the same code. Since signs may have many levels of meaning from the [[denotation (semiotics)|denotational]] to the [[connotation (semiotics)|connotational]], the addresser's strategy is to select and combine the signs in ways that limit the range of possible meanings likely to be generated when the message is interpreted. This will be achieved by including metalingual contextual clues, e.g. the nature of the medium, the [[modality (semiotics)|modality]] of the medium, the [[Stylistics (linguistics)|style]], e.g. [[academic]], [[literature|literary]], [[genre fiction]], etc., and references to, or invocations of, other codes, e.g. a reader may initially interpret a set of signifiers as a [[literal and figurative language|literal]] representation, but clues may indicate a transformation into a [[metaphor]]ical or [[allegorical]] interpretation [[Historical linguistics|diachronically]]. Distinctions of [[Social class|class]] or memberships of groups will be determined by the social identity each individual constructs through the way the language is spoken (i.e. with an [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] or as a [[dialect]]) or written (i.e. in sentences or in [[Short message service|SMS]] format), the place of residence (see [[American English|Americanisms]]), the nature of any employment undertaken, the style of dress, and nonverbal behaviour (e.g. through differentiating [[Norm (sociology)|custom]]s as to the extent of private space, whether and where people may touch or stare at each other, etc.). The process of [[socialisation]] is learning to understand the prevailing codes and then deciding which to apply at any given time, i.e. acknowledging that there is sometimes an [[ideological]] quality to the coding system, determining levels of social acceptability, reflecting current [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s and [[belief]]s. This includes regulatory codes that are intended to control behaviour and the use of some signifying codes. The human body is a means of using presentational codes through facial expressions, gestures, and dress. So words spoken may change their connotation to unacceptable if accompanied by inappropriate nonverbal signs.
The other code forms rely upon [[knowledge]] held by, and the interests of, the addressees. Specialised denotational codes may provide a more objective and impersonal form of language for mathematical, philosophical, and scientific texts. Hence, for example, the ability to read this text depends upon a more specialised form of [[vocabulary]] and different skills to those required to read a genre text detailing the investigations of a detective or the adventures of a secret agent. There are also specialised connotational and [[ideological]] codes to reflect particular social, political, moral, and aesthetic values. Musical and iconic codes would be relevant as between a work by [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and a piece of [[bubblegum pop]], and a painting by [[Rembrandt]] and a [[comic book]] by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], etc. Each medium has its own specialised codes and, by making them more explicit, semiotics is attempting to explain the practices and conventions have appeared in each form and to understand how meaning is being communicated. In return, this assists addressers to improve their techniques, no matter what their functional needs, e.g. as politicians, journalists, advertisers, creative artists, etc. Indeed, awareness leads to an intentional blending of codes for effect, e.g. an advertiser may produce a more effective campaign with a slogan, images and a jingle using lexical, social gestural, and musical codes.
In communication research and [[Media studies|media research]], the way receivers act towards the message and the way it is encoded becomes relevant, and generates different reactions: 
* In "radical reading" the audience rejects the meanings, values, and viewpoints built into the text by its makers.  
* In "dominant reading", the audience accepts the meanings, values, and viewpoints built into the text by its makers.  
* In "subordinate reading" the audience accepts, by and large, the meanings, values, and worldview built into the text by its makers&lt;ref&gt;Danesi, Marcel (2009), Dictionary of Media and Communications. M.E.Sharpe, Armonk, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft Köln (8533-35).jpg|thumb|Cologne Institute for Economic Research
Headquarters in Cologne, Germany
]]

The '''German Economic Institute''' (German: '''Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft''' Köln e.V.) ('''IW''') is a private economic research institute in Germany, which promotes a liberal economic and social order. The German Economic Institute is based in Cologne, Germany, with additional offices in Berlin, Germany, and Brussels, Belgium. 

The IW compiles analyses on economic and social policy issues. As a think tank, it combines research, consultancy and communication services. The research is based on empirical principles and sound scientific methodology. It stands for a socially responsible free market economy in German for the benefit of society as a whole. The institute’s long term goal is to support a liberal economic and social order in Germany and beyond and to improve understanding of how business and society function and interact..

The institute was founded in 1951 under the auspices of the [[Confederation of German Employers' Associations]] (BDA) and the [[:de:Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie|Federation of German Industries]] (BDI). The German Economic Institute is a registered association (e.V.). Its membership consists of some 110 German business and employers' associations as well as a number of individual companies. Membership fees finance the regular scientific research and advocacy. Additionally, the institute conducts research projects and carries out numerous studies financed by third parties, such as public institutions, foundations and businesses.

==IW Group and Governance Structures==

The German Economic Institute has four subsidiaries which together constitute the IW Group. The Group is composed of the core research department (IW Research), a commercial research consultancy (IW Consult), a publishing house (IW Medien), the German operator of the Junior Achievement Programme (IW Junior) and an academy (IW Akademie).
Through the organization’s decision-making bodies members contribute to the institute’s general orientation without having any specific influence on the contents of conducts research and the subsidiaries’ daily business. The annual general meeting of the executive board of the German Economic Institute elected Arndt Günter Kirchhoff, CEO of KIRCHHOFF Holding GmbH &amp; Co. KG, as its honorary president.

===IW Research===

Prof. Dr. [[Michael Hüther]] is the Director of the German Economic Institute and head of its management board. The management board consists of the Director, his Deputy Dr. Hans-Peter Fröhlich and the Heads of Research Dr. Hubertus Bardt and Dr. Hans-Peter Klös.

The Berlin Office is led by Dr. Knut Bergmann and the  Brussels Office by Sandra Parthie.

The institute’s research department itself is subdivided into eleven research units.

====Research Units====
* '''Labour Market''' - main focus on employment and unemployment, working conditions and personnel policy.
* '''Vocational qualification and specialists''' – Vocational training, further education, securing skilled personnel and international VET/PET research
* '''Vocational Rehabilitation and Inclusion''' - information resources for maximising the potential of workers with disabilities

'''Computational epidemiology''' is a multidisciplinary field that uses techniques from [[computer science]], [[mathematics]], [[geographic information science]] and [[public health]] to better understand issues central to [[epidemiology]] such as the spread of diseases or the effectiveness of a public health intervention.

==Introduction==
In contrast with traditional [[epidemiology]], computational epidemiology looks for patterns in unstructured sources of data, such as social media. It can be thought of as the hypothesis-generating antecedent to hypothesis-testing methods such as national surveys and randomized controlled trials.
A mathematical model is developed which describes the observed behavior of the viruses, based on the available data. Then simulations of the model are performed to understand the possible outcomes given the model used. These simulations produce as results projections which can then be used to make predictions or verify the facts and then be used to plan interventions and meters towards the control of the disease's spread.

'''Cross-resistance''' is the [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]] to a usually [[toxic substance]] as a result of exposure to a similarly acting substance. It is a phenomenon affecting e.g. [[pesticide]]s and [[antibiotic]]s. As an example [[rifabutin]] and [[rifampin]] cross react in the treatment of tuberculosis. This sort of resistance is also seen against drugs involved with the treatment of HIV. Drugs ending  with "- ine" and "-inavir" are the most common.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8369">'''Cultural practice''' generally refers to the manifestation of a [[culture]] or [[sub-culture]], especially in regard to the traditional and customary practices of a particular ethnic or other cultural group.  In the broadest sense, this term can apply to any person manifesting any aspect of any culture at any time.  However, in practical usage it often refers to the traditional practices developed within specific [[ethnic]] cultures, especially those aspects of culture that have been practiced since ancient times.

The term is gaining in importance due to the increased controversy over "rights of cultural practice", which are protected in many jurisdictions for [[indigenous peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/canadian/canada/justice/ethnocultural-groups/ecg-003-00.html|title=Cultural Practices in Conflict with Canadian Law|publisher=nizkor.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes ethnic minorities.  It is also a major component of the field of [[cultural studies]], and is a primary focus of international works such as the [[United Nations]] declaration of the rights of indigenous Peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/drip.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011180532/http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/drip.pdf|archivedate=2007-10-11|title=United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural practice is also a subject of discussion in questions of cultural survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onefish.org/servlet/CDSServlet?status=ND0zODkyLjMwMjUxJjY9ZW4mMzM9ZG9jdW1lbnRzJjM3PWluZm8~|title=oneFish Community Knowledge Directory|date=27 September 2011|publisher=www.onefish.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927234707/http://www.onefish.org/servlet/CDSServlet?status=ND0zODkyLjMwMjUxJjY9ZW4mMzM9ZG9jdW1lbnRzJjM3PWluZm8~|archivedate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If an ethnic group retains its formal ethnic identity but loses its core cultural practices or the knowledge, resources, or ability to continue them, questions arise as to whether the culture is able to actually survive at all.  International bodies such as the [[United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]] continually work on these issues, which are increasingly at the forefront of [[globalization]] questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBUD7nh8S74C&amp;dq=globalization%20indigenous%20cultural%20practice&amp;pg=PA109&amp;ots=tFWPvlmt2t&amp;sig=UVDszTZyqoLl0inD8cLaBqRjvhc&amp;prev=http://www.google.com/search?q=globalization+indigenous+cultural+practice&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=3|title=Globalization: Culture and identity|first=Roland|last=Robertson|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|via=Google Books|isbn=9780415236911|editor1=Roland Robertson|editor2=Kathleen E.

* Natural resource management
* Housing and construction
* Childcare practices
* Governance, leadership, conflict resolution
* Power relationships
* International cultural practices
* "Everyday life" practices (including household relationships)

==Qualifications==

The real question of what qualifies as a legitimate cultural practice is the subject of much legal and ethnic community debate.  The question arises in controversial subject areas such as [[genital mutilation]], indigenous [[hunting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/message.aspx?&amp;mst=404|title=Global Affairs Canada|first1=Global Affairs|last1=Canada|first2=Affaires mondiales|last2=Canada|date=26 June 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Intensive gathering|gathering]] practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WD-huzL13PgC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=native%20gathering%20rights&amp;source=web&amp;ots=6-ctah600m&amp;sig=7ZFC04KaQAmiTbXeWsVmhC1W39k#PPA8,M1|title=The Role of Customary Law in Sustainable Development|first=Peter|last=Orebech|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the question of licensing of [[Traditional medicine|traditional medical practitioners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camsociety.org/issues/Attitudes.htm|title=Traditional Chinese Medicine in Chinese-American Communities|first=Conrad|last=Wang|publisher=www.camsociety.org|date=Fall 1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001021235131/http://www.camsociety.org/issues/Attitudes.htm|archivedate=2000-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ann.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/583/1/173.pdf|title=Traditional Medicine in Africa|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=September 2002|volume=583|issue=1|pages=173–176|doi=10.1177/000271620258300111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00192826|title=The changing geography of traditional medicine: Urban herbalism on the Witwatersrand, South Africa|first=Rolf P.

Many traditional cultures acknowledge members outside of their ethnicity as cultural practitioners, but only under special circumstances.  Generally, the knowledge or title must be passed in a traditional way, such as family knowledge shared through [[adoption]], or through a master of that practice choosing a particular student who shows qualities desired for that practice, and teaching that student in a hands-on manner, in which they are able to absorb the core values and belief systems of the culture.  The degree to which these non-ethnic practitioners are able to exercise "customary and traditional" rights, and the degree to which their practice is acknowledged as valid, is often a subject of considerable debate among indigenous and other ethnic communities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/eaglefeatherlaw/argument.html]{{dead link|date=October 2010|bot=AnomieBOT}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes with the legal systems under which these communities function.  The difference between bona fide non-native cultural practitioners and cultural piracy, or [[cultural appropriation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthcall.org/en/faq/|title=Frequently Asked Questions|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050903191209/http://www.earthcall.org/en/faq/|archivedate=2005-09-03|publisher=earthcall.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a major issue within the study of [[globalization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ejcl.org/75/art75-7.html|title=Biotechnology, Patent Law and Piracy|volume=7|issue=5|first=Jerzy |last=Koopman|journal=Electronic Journal of Comparative Law|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[modernization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= indigenous cultures|url=http://www.caslon.com.au/ipguide14.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213204315/http://caslon.com.au/ipguide14.htm|archivedate=2014-02-13|publisher=Caslon Analytics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of culture==
The evolution of traditional cultures is a subject of much discussion in legal, scholarly, and community forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~sai/Saht_indig_way.html|title=Earthdance: Chapter 20 - The Indigenous Way|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is generally accepted that all cultures are to some degree in a continual state of [[sociocultural evolution]].  However, major questions surround the legitimacy of newly evolved cultural expressions, especially when these are influenced by [[modernization]] or by the influence of other cultures.  Also, there is significant debate surrounding the source of evolution: for example, an indigenous community may accept the use of store-bought materials in the creation of traditional arts, but may reject requirements to apply for a permit for certain gathering purposes; the central difference being that one is an ''internal'' cultural evolution, while the other is ''externally'' driven&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/8152/Westernization-Africa.html|title=Westernization - Africa - Bibliography|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the society or legal body that surrounds the culture.

A '''decree''' ([[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]]: '''''decretum''''', from ''decerno'', "I judge")  is, in a general sense, an order or law made by a superior authority for the direction of others. In the usage of the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Catholic Church]], it has various meanings. Any [[papal Bull]], [[papal brief|Brief]], or [[Motu Proprio]] is a decree inasmuch as these documents are legislative acts of the [[Pope]]. In this sense the term is quite ancient.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Pope Siricius]] speaks (Ep. i, ad Himer., c. ii) of the ''decreta generalia'' of [[Pope Liberius]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Congregations]] were formerly empowered to issue decrees in matters which come under their particular jurisdiction, but were forbidden from continuing to do so under [[Pope Benedict XV]] in 1917. Each [[ecclesiastical province]], and also each [[diocese]] may issue decrees in their periodical [[synods]] within their sphere of authority. 
==Canon 29 definition==
{{further|Jurisprudence of canon law #Lex}}
Canon 29 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law offers a definition of general decrees:
{{quote|General decrees, by which a competent legislator makes common provisions for a community capable of receiving a law, are true laws and are regulated by the provisions of the canons on laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P4.HTM Canon 29], [[1983 Code of Canon Law]]; accessed 30 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The canon reproduces substantial elements (later deleted) of the original draft of what would become canon 7.&lt;ref name=Exegetical261&gt;''Exegetical commentary'', pg. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; This canon incorporates a definition which takes its inspiration from [[Thomas Aquinas]]' definition of human law found in his ''[[Treatise on Law]]''.&lt;ref name=Exegetical261/&gt;

==Codifications==
{{see also|Decretal}}
The word is also used to denote certain specified collections of church law, e.g. [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]]'s Decree (''[[Decretum Gratiani]]''). In respect of the general legislative acts of the pope there is never doubt as to the universal extent of the obligation; the same may be said of the decrees of a General Council, e.g. those of the [[First Vatican Council]]. 

The Council of Trent was the first to apply the term indiscriminately to rulings concerning faith and discipline (''decreta de fide, de reformatione'').

==Decrees of Roman curial congregations==
{{Roman Curia}}
{{main|Congregation (Roman Curia)}}
{{see also|1917 Code of Canon Law}}
The Roman Congregations were formerly empowered to issue decrees in matters which came under their particular jurisdiction. The decrees of the [[congregation (Roman Curia)|Roman Congregations]] (q. v.) are certainly binding in each case submitted for judgment. But there are varying opinions as to whether such judgment is to be taken as a rule or general law applying to all similar cases. The common opinion is that when the decisions are enlargements of the law (''declaratio extensiva legis'') the decisions do not bind except in the particular case for which the decree is made. If, however, the decision is not an enlargement, but merely an explanation of the law (''declaratio comprehensiva legis''), such decree binds in similar cases.
===Benedict XV's restriction of curial decrees===
[[File:Cover of a copy of the 1917 Codex Iuris Canonici (Code of Canon Law).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Hardcover of the ''1917 Code of Canon Law'']]
On 15 September 1917, by the ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''Cum Iuris Canonici'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Benedict XV]], [[motu proprio]] ''Cum Iuris Canonici'' of 15 September 1917, ([[Edward N. Peters]], 1917 Code, pg. 25)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Benedict XV]] made provision for a Pontifical Commission charged with interpreting the code and making any necessary modifications as later legislation was issued. New laws would be appended to existing canons in new paragraphs or inserted between canons, repeating the number of the previous canon and adding ''bis'', ''ter'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Benedict XV]], [[motu proprio]] ''Cum Iuris Canonici'' of 15 September 1917, §III ([[Edward N. Peters]], 1917 Code, pg. 26)&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. "canon 1567''bis''" in the style of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]) so as not to subvert the ordering of the code, or the existing text of a canon would be completely supplanted. The numbering of the canons was not to be altered.&lt;ref&gt;Metz, ''What is Canon Law?'' pgs. 62-63&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Congregation (Roman Curia)|Roman Congregations]] were forbidden to issue new general decrees, unless it was necessary, and then only after consulting the Pontifical Commission charged with amending the code. The congregations were instead to issue Instructions on the canons of the code, and to make it clear that they were elucidating particular canons of the code.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Benedict XV]], [[motu proprio]] ''Cum Iuris Canonici'' of 15 September 1917, §§II-III ([[Edward N. Peters]], 1917 Code, pg. 26)&lt;/ref&gt; This was done so as not to make the code obsolete soon after it was promulgated. The 1917 Code was very rarely amended, and then only slightly.&lt;ref&gt;Metz, ''What is Canon Law?'' pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Particular law==
The decrees of a national council may not be promulgated until they have received the approval of the pope. The decrees of a provincial synod have no force until they have been approved by Rome. This approval is twofold: ordinary (''in formâ communi''), and specific (''in formâ specificâ''). The former means that there is nothing which needs correction in the decrees of the synod, and they thereby have force in the province. This is the approval generally given to such decrees. If approval is given in ''formâ specificâ'' the decrees have the same force as if they emanated from the Apostolic See, though they are binding only in the province for which they are made. 

The decrees of a diocesan bishop deal with the administration and good order of his diocese. If they are made during a synod, they are diocesan laws, are usually known as "diocesan statutes", or "synodal statutes", and bind until revoked by the bishop or his successor. If the decrees are extra-synodal, they have force only during the lifetime of the bishop or until he revokes them himself.

== Theoretical background ==
The theory presents simple mechanistic rules that describe the uptake and allocation of energy (and nutrients) and the consequences for physiological organization throughout an organism's life cycle, including the relationships of energetics with aging and effects of toxicants.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  Assumptions of the DEB theory are delineated in an explicit way,  the approach clearly distinguishes mechanisms associated with intra‐ and interspecific variation in metabolic rates, and equations for energy flows are mathematically derived following the principles of physics and simplicity.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ledder|first=Glenn|date=2014|title=The Basic Dynamic Energy Budget Model and Some Implications|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23737867.2014.11414482|journal=Letters in Biomathematics|volume=1:2|pages= 221–233|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarà|first=Gianluca|last2=Rinaldi|first2=Alessandro|last3=Montalto|first3=Valeria|date=2014-12-01|title=Thinking beyond organism energy use: a trait-based bioenergetic mechanistic approach for predictions of life history traits in marine organisms|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/maec.12106|journal=Marine Ecology|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=506–515|doi=10.1111/maec.12106|issn=1439-0485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornerstones of the theory are:

* conservation of [[mass balance|mass]], [[Energy balance (biology)|energy]] and [[time balance|time]],
* relationships between surface area and volume
* [[stoichiometric]] constraints on production
* organizational uncoupling of metabolic [[modularity (biology)|modules]] (assimilation, dissipation, growth)
* strong and weak [[homeostasis]] (composition of compartments is constant; composition of the organism is constant when the food is constant) 
* substrate(s) from the environment is/are first converted to reserve(s) before being used for further metabolism

The theory specifies that an organism is made up two main compartments: '''[[Dynamic reserve|(energy) reserve]]''' and '''structure'''. Assimilation of energy is proportional to surface area of the structure, and maintenance is proportional to its volume. Reserve does not require maintenance. Energy mobilization will depend on the relative amount of the energy reserve, and on the interface between reserve and structure. Once mobilized, the energy is split into two branches:

* a fixed proportion  (termed kappa, κ) is allocated to  [[Individual growth|growth]] (increase of structural mass) and maintenance of structure, while 
* the remaining proportion (1- κ) is allocated to processes of maturation (increase in complexity, installation of regulation systems, preparation for reproduction) and maintaining the level of attained maturity (including, e.g., maintenance of defense systems).

The κ-rule therefore states that the processes of growth and maturation do not directly compete. [[Maintenance of an organism|Maintenance]] needs to be paid before allocating energy to other processes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In the context of energy acquisition and allocation, the theory recognizes three main developmental stages: '''embryo''', which does not feed or reproduce, '''juvenile''', which feeds but does not reproduce, and '''adult''', which both feeds and is allocating energy to reproduction. Transitions between these life stages occur at events specified as '''birth''' and '''puberty''', which are reached when energy invested into maturation (tracked as 'level of '''maturity'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;') reaches a certain threshold. Maturity does not increase in the adult stage, and maturity maintenance is proportional to maturity.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Biochemical composition of reserve and structure is considered to be that of [[generalised compound]]s, and is constant (the assumption of strong homeostasis) but not necessarily identical. Biochemical transformation from food to reserve (assimilation), and from reserve to structure (growth) include overhead costs. These overheads, together with processes of somatic and maturity [[Maintenance of an organism|maintenance]] and reproduction overheads (inefficiencies in transformation from reserve to reproductive material), all contribute to the consumption of oxygen and production of carbon dioxide, i.e. [[metabolism]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== DEB models ==
All dynamic energy budget models follow the energy budget of an individual organism throughout its life cycle; by contrast,"static" energy budget models describe a specific life stage or [[size]] of an organism.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lika|first=Konstadia|last2=Nisbet|first2=Roger M.|date=2000-10-01|title=A Dynamic Energy Budget model based on partitioning of net production|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002850000049|journal=Journal of Mathematical Biology|language=en|volume=41|issue=4|pages=361–386|doi=10.1007/s002850000049|issn=0303-6812}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantage of the DEB-theory based model over most other models is its description of energy assimilation and utilization ([[Dynamic reserve|reserve dynamics]]) simultaneously with decoupled processes of growth, [[Developmental biology|development/ maturation]], and [[Maintenance of an organism|maintenance]].&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mueller|first=Casey A.|last2=Augustine|first2=Starrlight|last3=Kooijman|first3=Sebastiaan A.L.M.|last4=Kearney|first4=Michael R.|last5=Seymour|first5=Roger S.|title=The trade-off between maturation and growth during accelerated development in frogs|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S109564331200308X|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Molecular &amp; Integrative Physiology|volume=163|issue=1|pages=95–102|doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2012.05.190}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DEB theory specifies [[dynamic reserve|reserve]]s as separate from structure: these are the two [[state variable]]s that contribute to physical volume, and (in combination with reproduction buffer of adults) fully define the size of an individual. Maturity (also a [[state variable]] of the model) tracks how much energy has been invested into maturation, and therefore determines the life stage of the organism relative to maturity levels at which life stage transitions (birth and puberty) occur. Dynamics of the state variables are given by [[ordinary differential equation]]s which include the major processes of energy uptake and use: assimilation, mobilization, maintenance, growth, maturation, and reproduction.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

* Food is transformed into reserve, which fuels all other metabolic processes. The feeding rate is proportional to the surface area; food handling time and the transformation efficiency from food to reserve are independent of food density.
* A fixed fraction (kappa) of mobilized reserve is allocated to somatic maintenance plus growth (soma), the rest on maturity maintenance plus maturation or reproduction. Maintenance has priority over other processes. Somatic maintenance is proportional to structural body volume, and maturity maintenance to maturity. Heating costs for endotherms and osmostic work (for fresh water organisms) are somatic maintenance costs that are proportional to surface area.
* Stage transitions occur if the cumulated investment into [[Developmental biology|maturation]] exceeds threshold values. Life stages typically are: embryo, juvenile, and adult. Reserve that is allocated to reproduction is first accumulated in a buffer. The rules for converting the buffer to gametes are species-specific (e.g. spawning can be once per season).

[[Parametrization|Parameters]] of the model are individual specific, but similarities between individuals of the same species yield species-specific parameter estimations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/research/bib/MarqAugu2018.html|title=The AmP project: Comparing Species on the Basis of Dynamic Energy Budget Parameters|last=Marques, G.

===The standard DEB model===
The standard model quantifies the metabolism of an [[isomorph]] (organism that does not change in shape during ontogeny) that feeds on one type of food with a constant composition (therefore the weak [[homeostasis]] applies, i.e. the chemical composition of the body is constant). The state variables of the individual are 1 reserve, 1 structure, maturity, and (in the adult stage) the reproduction buffer. Parameter values are constant throughout life. The reserve density at birth equals that of the mother at egg formation. [[Foetus]]es develop similarly, but receive unrestricted amount of reserve from the mother during development.

===Extensions of the standard model===

DEB theory has been extended into many directions, such as 
*effects of changes in shape during growth (e.g. [[V1-morph]]s and [[V0-morph]]s)
*non-standard embryo-&gt;juvenile-&gt;adult transitions, for example in holometabolic insects &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Llandres|first=Ana L.|last2=Marques|first2=Gonçalo M.|last3=Maino|first3=James L.|last4=Kooijman|first4=S.

== Criticism ==
The main criticism is directed to the formal presentation of the theory (heavy mathematical jargon), number of listed parameters, the symbol heavy notation, and the fact that modeled (state) variables and parameters are abstract quantities which cannot be directly measured, all making it less likely to reach its intended audience (ecologists) and be an "efficient" theory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marquet|first=Pablo A.|last2=Allen|first2=Andrew P.|last3=Brown|first3=James H.|last4=Dunne|first4=Jennifer A.|last5=Enquist|first5=Brian J.|last6=Gillooly|first6=James F.|last7=Gowaty|first7=Patricia A.|last8=Green|first8=Jessica L.|last9=Harte|first9=John|date=2014-08-01|title=On Theory in Ecology|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/64/8/701/2754269|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=64|issue=8|pages=701–710|doi=10.1093/biosci/biu098|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, more recent publications aim to present the DEB theory in an "easier to digest" content to "bridge the ecology-mathematics gap".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The general methodology of estimation of DEB parameters from data is described in [http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/research/bib/Meer2006.html van der Meer 2006]; [http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/research/bib/KooySous2008.html Kooijman et al 2008] shows which particular compound parameters can be estimated from a few simple observations at a single food density and how an increasing number of parameters can be estimated if more quantities are observed at several food densities. A natural sequence exists in which parameters can be known in principle. In addition, routines for data entry and scripts for parameter estimation are available as a free and documented software package [http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/debtool/DEBtool_M/manual/index.html DEBtool], aiming to provide a ready-to-use tool for users with less mathematical and programing background. Number of parameters, also pointed as relatively sparse for a bioenergetic model,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; vary depending on the main application and, because the whole life cycle of an organism is defined, the overall number of parameters per data-set ratio is relatively low.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kearney|first=Michael R.|last2=Domingos|first2=Tiago|last3=Nisbet|first3=Roger|date=2015-04-01|title=Dynamic Energy Budget Theory: An Efficient and General Theory for Ecology|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-abstract/65/4/341/255084|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=65|issue=4|pages=341–341|doi=10.1093/biosci/biv013|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linking the DEB (abstract) and measured properties is done by simple mathematical operations which include auxiliary parameters (also defined by the DEB theory and included in the [http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/debtool/DEBtool_M/manual/index.html DEBtool] routines), and include also switching between energy-time and mass-time contexts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  [https://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/add_my_pet/index.html Add my pet (AmP)] project explores parameter pattern values across taxa. The DEB notation is a result of combining the symbols from the main fields of science ([[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]]) used in the theory, while trying to keep the symbols consistent.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; As the symbols themselves contain a fair bit of information  &lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; (see [http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/research/bib/Kooy2010_n.pdf DEB notation] document), they are kept in most of the DEB literature.

==  Compatibility (and applicability) of DEB theory/models with other approaches ==
Dynamic energy budget theory presents a quantitative framework of metabolic organization common to all life forms, which could help to understand evolution of metabolic organization since the origin of life.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As such, it has a common aim with the other widely used metabolic theory: the [[Metabolic theory of ecology|West-Brown-Enquist (WBE) metabolic theory of ecology]], which prompted side-by-side analysis of the two approaches.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Craig R.|last2=Kearney|first2=Michael R.|last3=Matthews|first3=Philip G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18349">'''Effective radiated power''' ('''ERP'''), synonymous with '''equivalent radiated power''',  is an [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] standardized definition of directional [[radio frequency]] (RF) power, such as that emitted by a [[radio transmitter]].  It is the total [[Power (physics)|power]] in [[watt (unit)|watt]]s that would have to be radiated by a [[dipole antenna|half-wave dipole antenna]] to give the same radiation intensity (signal strength in watts per square meter) as the actual source at a distant receiver located in the direction of the antenna's strongest beam ([[main lobe]]).  ERP measures the combination of the power emitted by the transmitter and the ability of the antenna to direct that power in a given direction.   It is equal to the input power to the antenna multiplied by the [[antenna gain|gain]] of the antenna.  It is used in electronics and [[telecommunication]]s, particularly in [[broadcasting]] to quantify the apparent power of a [[broadcasting station]] experienced by listeners in its reception area.

An alternate parameter that measures the same thing is '''effective (or equivalent) isotropic radiated power''' ('''EIRP''').  Effective isotropic radiated power is the total power that would have to be radiated by a hypothetical [[isotropic antenna]] to give the same signal strength as the actual source in the direction of the antenna's strongest beam.  The difference between EIRP and ERP is that ERP compares the actual antenna to a half-wave dipole antenna, while EIRP compares it to a theoretical isotropic antenna.  Since a half-wave dipole antenna has a gain of 1.64, or 2.15 [[decibel]]s compared to an isotropic radiator, if ERP and EIRP are expressed in watts their relation is 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EIRP(W)} =  1.64 \cdot \mathrm{ERP(W)}&lt;/math&gt;
If they are expressed in decibels
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EIRP(dB)} = \mathrm{ERP(dB)} + 2.15&lt;/math&gt;

== Definitions ==
Effective radiated power and effective isotropic radiated power both measure the amount of power a radio transmitter and antenna (or other source of electromagnetic waves) radiates in a specific direction: in the direction of maximum signal strength (the "[[main lobe]]") of its radiation pattern.&lt;ref name="NAB"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This maximum radiated power is dependent on two factors: the total power output and the [[radiation pattern]] of the antenna – how much of that power is radiated in the desired direction. The latter factor is quantified by the [[antenna gain]], which is the ratio of the signal strength radiated by an antenna to that radiated by a standard antenna.  For example, a 1,000-watt transmitter feeding an antenna with a gain of 4 (6 dBi) will have the same signal strength in the direction of its main lobe, and thus the same ERP and EIRP, as a 4,000-watt transmitter feeding an antenna with a gain of 1 (0 dBi).  So ERP and EIRP are measures of radiated power that can compare different combinations of transmitters and antennas on an equal basis.

The difference between ERP and EIRP is that antenna gain has traditionally been measured in two different units, comparing the antenna to two different standard antennas; an [[isotropic antenna]] and a [[half-wave dipole]] antenna:  
*''Isotropic gain'' is the ratio of the power density &lt;math&gt;S_\text{max}&lt;/math&gt; (signal strength in watts per square meter) received at a point far from the antenna (in the [[far field]]) in the direction of its maximum radiation (main lobe), to the power &lt;math&gt;S_\text{max,isotropic}&lt;/math&gt; received at the same point from a hypothetical lossless [[isotropic antenna]], which radiates equal power in all directions 
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{G}_\text{i} = {S_\text{max}  \over S_\text{max,isotropic}}&lt;/math&gt;
:Gain is often expressed in logarithmic units of [[decibel]]s (dB).  The decibel gain relative to an isotropic antenna (dBi) is given by
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{G}\text{(dBi)} = 10\log{S_\text{max}  \over S_\text{max,isotropic}}&lt;/math&gt;
*''Dipole gain'' is the ratio of the power density received from the antenna in the direction of its maximum radiation to the power density &lt;math&gt;S_\text{max,dipole}&lt;/math&gt; received from a lossless [[half-wave dipole]] antenna in the direction of its maximum radiation
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{G}_\text{d} = {S_\text{max}  \over S_\text{max,dipole}}&lt;/math&gt;
:The decibel gain relative to a dipole (dBd) is given by
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{G}\text{(dBd)} = 10\log{S_\text{max}  \over S_\text{max,dipole}}&lt;/math&gt;
In contrast to an isotropic antenna, the dipole has a "donut-shaped" radiation pattern, its radiated power is maximum in directions perpendicular to the antenna, declining to zero on the antenna axis.  Since the radiation of the dipole is concentrated in horizontal directions,  the gain of a half-wave dipole is greater than that of an isotropic antenna.  The isotropic gain of a half-wave dipole is 1.64, or in decibels 10 log 1.64 = 2.15 dBi, so
:&lt;math&gt;G_\text{i} =  1.64G_\text{d}&lt;/math&gt; 
In decibels
:&lt;math&gt;G\text{(dBi)} = G\text{(dBd)} + 2.15&lt;/math&gt;

The two measures EIRP and ERP are based on the two different standard antennas above:&lt;ref name="NAB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Seybold" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weik" /&gt;
*EIRP is defined as the RMS power input in watts required to a lossless [[isotropic antenna]]  to give the same maximum power density far from the antenna as the actual transmitter. It is equal to the power input to the transmitter's antenna multiplied by the isotropic antenna gain
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EIRP} = G_\text{i} P_\text{in}&lt;/math&gt;
:The ERP and EIRP are also often expressed in [[decibel]]s (dB).  The input power in decibels is usually calculated with comparison to a reference level of one [[watt (unit)|watt]] (W): &lt;math&gt;P_\text{in}\mathrm{(dBw)} = 10 \log P_\text{in}&lt;/math&gt;.  Since multiplication of two factors is equivalent to addition of their decibel values
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EIRP(dBw)} = G\text{(dBi)} + P_\text{in}\mathrm{(dBw)}&lt;/math&gt;

*ERP is defined as the RMS power input in watts required to a lossless [[half-wave dipole]] antenna to give the same maximum power density far from the antenna as the actual transmitter. It is equal to the power input to the transmitter's antenna multiplied by the antenna gain relative to a half-wave dipole
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ERP} = G_\text{d} P_\text{in}&lt;/math&gt;
:In decibels
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ERP(dBw)} = G\text{(dBd)} + P_\text{in}\mathrm{(dBw)}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the two definitions of gain only differ by a constant factor, so do ERP and EIRP
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EIRP(W)} =  1.64 \cdot \mathrm{ERP(W)}&lt;/math&gt; 
In decibels
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EIRP(dBw)} =\mathrm{ERP}\text{(dBw)} + 2.15&lt;/math&gt;

==Relation to transmitter output power==
The transmitter is usually connected to the antenna through a [[transmission line]]. Since the transmission line may have significant losses &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, the power applied to the antenna is usually less than the output power of the transmitter &lt;math&gt;P_\text{TX}&lt;/math&gt;.  The relation of ERP and EIRP to transmitter output power is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EIRP(dBw)} =  P_\text{TX}\mathrm{(dBw)} - L\mathrm{(dB)} +  G\text{(dBi)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ERP(dBw)} =  P_\text{TX}\mathrm{(dBw)} - L\mathrm{(dB)} +  G\text{(dBi)} - 2.15&lt;/math&gt;
Losses in the antenna itself are included in the gain.

== Antenna gain and directivity ==
Antenna gain is closely related to directivity and often incorrectly used interchangeably.  However, gain is always less than directivity by a factor called radiation efficiency, η.  Whereas directivity is entirely a function of wavelength and the geometry and type of antenna, gain takes into account the losses that always occur within a real antenna.  Specifically, accelerating charge (time varying current) causes electromagnetic radiation per [[Maxwell's equations]].  Therefore, antennas use a current distribution on radiating elements to generate electromagnetic energy that propagates away from the antenna.  This coupling is never 100% efficient (by [[Laws of thermodynamics|Laws of Thermodynamics]]), and therefore antenna gain will always be less than directivity by this efficiency factor.

== Dipole vs. isotropic radiators ==
Because ERP is calculated as antenna gain (in a given direction) as compared with the maximum directivity of a half-wave [[dipole antenna]], it creates a mathematically virtual effective dipole antenna oriented in the direction of the receiver.  In other words, a notional receiver in a given direction from the transmitter would receive the same power if the source were replaced with an ideal dipole oriented with maximum directivity and matched [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] towards the receiver and with an antenna input power equal to the ERP.  The receiver would not be able to determine a difference.  Maximum directivity of an ideal half-wave dipole is a constant, i.e., 0 dBd = 2.15 dBi.  Therefore, ERP is always 2.15&amp;nbsp;dB less than EIRP.  The ideal dipole antenna could be further replaced by an isotropic radiator (a purely mathematical device which cannot exist in the real world), and the receiver cannot know the difference so long as the input power is increased by 2.15&amp;nbsp;dB.

Unfortunately, the distinction between dBd and dBi is often left unstated and the reader is sometimes forced to infer which was used.  For example, a [[Yagi-Uda antenna]] is constructed from several dipoles arranged at precise intervals to create better energy focusing (directivity) than a simple dipole.  Since it is constructed from dipoles, often its antenna gain is expressed in dBd, but listed only as dB.  Obviously this ambiguity is undesirable with respect to engineering specifications.  A Yagi-Uda antenna's maximum directivity is 8.77 dBd = 10.92 dBi.  Its gain necessarily must be less than this by the factor η, which must be negative in units of dB.  Neither ERP nor EIRP can be calculated without knowledge of the power accepted by the antenna, i.e., it is not correct to use units of dBd or dBi with ERP and EIRP.  Let us assume a 100-watt (20 dBW) transmitter with losses of 6&amp;nbsp;dB prior to the antenna.  ERP &lt; 22.77dBW and EIRP &lt; 24.92dBW, both less than ideal by η in dB.  Assuming that the receiver is in the first side-lobe of the transmitting antenna, and each value is further reduced by 7.2&amp;nbsp;dB, which is the decrease in directivity from the main to side-lobe of a Yagi-Uda.  Therefore, anywhere along the side-lobe direction from this transmitter, a blind receiver could not tell the difference if a Yagi-Uda was replaced with either an ideal dipole (oriented towards the receiver) or an isotropic radiator with antenna input power increased by 1.57&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Field and Wave Electromagnetics, 2nd Ed.|last=Cheng|first=David K.|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=648–650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Polarization ==
Polarization has not been taken into account so far, but it must be properly clarified.  When considering the dipole radiator previously we assumed that it was perfectly aligned with the receiver.  Now assume, however, that the receiving antenna is circularly polarized, and there will be a minimum 3&amp;nbsp;dB polarization loss regardless of antenna orientation.  If the receiver is also a dipole, it is possible to align it orthogonally to the transmitter such that theoretically zero energy is received.  However, this polarization loss is not accounted for in the calculation of ERP or EIRP.  Rather, the receiving system designer must account for this loss as appropriate.  For example, a cellular telephone tower has a fixed linear polarization, but the mobile handset must function well at any arbitrary orientation.  Therefore, a handset design might provide dual polarization receive on the handset so that captured energy is maximized regardless of orientation, or the designer might use a circularly polarized antenna and account for the extra 3&amp;nbsp;dB of loss with amplification.

== FM example ==
[[Image:Antenna-tower-collinear-et-al.jpg|thumb|130px|An antenna tower consisting of a high-gain [[collinear antenna array]].]]
For example, an [[frequency modulation|FM]] [[radio station]] which [[advertise]]s that it has 100,000 [[watt]]s of power actually has 100,000 watts ERP, and ''not'' an actual 100,000-watt transmitter.  The [[transmitter power output]] (TPO) of such a station typically may be 10,000 to 20,000 watts, with a gain factor of 5 to 10 (5× to 10×, or 7 to 10 [[Decibel|dB]]).  In most antenna designs, gain is realized primarily by concentrating power toward the [[horizontal plane]] and suppressing it at upward and downward angles, through the use of [[phased array]]s of antenna elements.  The distribution of power versus [[elevation angle]] is known as the vertical pattern.  When an antenna is also directional horizontally, gain and ERP will vary with [[azimuth]] ([[compass]] direction).  Rather than the [[average]] power over all directions, it is the apparent power in the direction of the antenna's main lobe that is quoted as a station's ERP (this statement is just another way of stating the definition of ERP).  This is particularly applicable to the huge ERPs reported for [[shortwave]] broadcasting stations, which use very narrow [[beam width]]s to get their signals across [[continent]]s and [[ocean]]s.

=== United States regulatory usage ===
ERP for FM radio in the United States is always relative to a theoretical [[Dipole antenna#Dipole as a reference standard|reference half-wave dipole]] antenna. (That is, when calculating ERP, the most direct approach is to work with antenna gain in dBd). To deal with antenna polarization, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) lists ERP in both the horizontal and vertical [[measurement]]s for FM and TV.  Horizontal is the standard for both, but if the vertical ERP is larger it will be used instead.

The maximum ERP for US FM broadcasting is usually 100,000 watts (FM Zone II) or 50,000 watts (in the generally more densely populated Zones I and I-A), though exact restrictions vary depending on the class of license and the [[Height above average terrain|antenna height above average terrain (HAAT)]].&lt;ref&gt;47 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] 73.211&lt;/ref&gt;  Some stations have been [[grandfather clause|grandfathered]] in or, very infrequently, been given a [[waiver]], and can exceed normal restrictions.

== Microwave band issues ==
For most [[microwave]] systems, a completely non-directional [[isotropic antenna]] (one which [[Radiation|radiates]] equally and perfectly well in every direction &amp;ndash; a physical impossibility) is used as a reference antenna, and then one speaks of [[EIRP]] (effective ''isotropic'' radiated power) rather than ERP.  This includes [[satellite]] [[transponder]]s, radar, and other systems which use microwave dishes and reflectors rather than dipole-style antennas.

== Lower-frequency issues ==
In the case of [[medium wave]] (AM) stations in the [[United States]], power limits are set to the actual transmitter power output, and ERP is not used in normal calculations. Omnidirectional antennas used by a number of stations radiate the signal equally in all directions. Directional arrays are used to protect co- or adjacent channel stations, usually at night, but some run directionally 24 hours. While antenna efficiency and ground conductivity are taken into account when designing such an array, the FCC database shows the station's transmitter power output, not ERP.

== Related terms ==
'''Effective monopole radiated power''' (EMRP) may be used in Europe, particularly in relation to [[mediumwave]] broadcasting antennas.  This is the same as ERP, except that a short vertical antenna (i.e. a short [[Monopole antenna|monopole]]) is used as the reference antenna instead of a half-wave [[dipole]].

== HAAT ==
{{main article|Height above average terrain}}
The height above average terrain for VHF and higher frequencies is extremely important when considering ERP, as the signal coverage ([[broadcast range]]) produced by a given ERP dramatically increases with antenna height.  Because of this, it is possible for a station of only a few hundred watts ERP to cover more area than a station of a few thousand watts ERP, if its signal travels above obstructions on the ground.

__NOTOC__
'''Ethnolinguistics''' (sometimes called '''cultural linguistics''')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ferraro |first=Gary |title=Cultural Anthropology: An Applied Perspective |location= |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2006 |isbn=0-495-10008-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a field of [[linguistics]] that studies the relationship between language and culture and how different [[ethnic group]]s perceive the world. It is the combination between [[ethnology]] and linguistics. The former refers to the way of life of an entire community: all the characteristics that distinguish one community from the other. Such characteristics make the cultural aspects of a community or a society.

Ethnolinguists study the way perception and conceptualization influences language and show how that is linked to different cultures and societies. An example is how spatial orientation is expressed in various cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernd Heine|Heine, Bernd]] (1997) ''Cognitive Foundations of Grammar''. Oxford/New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tuan, Yi-Fu (1974) ''Topophilia: A study of environmental perception, attitudes, and values.'' Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; In many societies, words for the [[cardinal direction]]s ''east'' and ''west'' are derived from terms for sunrise/sunset. The nomenclature for cardinal directions of [[Inuit languages|Inuit]] speakers of [[Greenland]], however, is based on geographical landmarks such as the river system and one's position on the coast. Similarly, the [[Yurok language|Yurok]] lack the idea of cardinal directions; they orient themselves with respect to their principal geographic feature, the [[Klamath River]].

Cultural Linguistics is a related branch of linguistics that explores the relationship between language and cultural conceptualisations.&lt;ref name="Sharifian2011"/&gt; Cultural Linguistics draws on and expands the theoretical and analytical advancements in cognitive science (including complexity science and distributed cognition) and anthropology. Cultural linguistics examines how various features of human languages encode cultural conceptualisations, including cultural schemas, cultural categories, and cultural metaphors.&lt;ref name="Sharifian2011"&gt;Sharifian, Farzad (2011). Cultural Conceptualisations and Language: Theoretical Framework and Applications. Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt; In {{Not a typo|Cultural Linguistics}}, language is viewed as deeply entrenched in the group-level, cultural cognition of communities of speakers. Thus far, the approach of Cultural Linguistics has been adopted in several areas of [[applied linguistic]] research, including [[intercultural communication]], [[second language learning]], Teaching English as an International Language, and [[World Englishes]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharifian, Farzad &amp; Palmer, Gary B. (eds.) (2007) Applied cultural linguistics: Implications for second language learning and intercultural communication. Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GRANK''', or '''Global Rank''' is a ranking of the rarity of a [[species]], and is a useful tool in determining conservation needs.
Global Ranks are derived from a [[consensus]] of various conservation data centres, natural heritage programmes, scientific experts and [[The Nature Conservancy]].

They are based on the total number of known, extant populations worldwide, and to what degree they are threatened by destruction.  Criteria also include securely protected populations, size of populations, and the ability of the species to persist.

* '''G1 — Extremely rare'''  Usually 5 or fewer occurrences in the overall range or very few remaining individuals; or because of some factor(s) making it especially vulnerable to extinction.
* '''G2 — Very rare'''  Usually between 5 and 20 occurrences in the overall range or with many individuals in fewer occurrences; or because of some factor(s) making it vulnerable to extinction.
* '''G3 — Rare to uncommon'''  Usually between 20 and 100 occurrences; may have fewer occurrences, but with a large number of individuals in some populations; may be susceptible to large-scale disturbances.
* '''G4 — Common'''  Usually more than 100 occurrences; usually not susceptible to immediate threats.
* '''G5 — Very common'''  Demonstrably secure under present conditions.
* '''GH — Historic'''  No records in the past 20 years.
* '''GU — Status uncertain'''  Often because of low search effort or cryptic nature of the species; more data needed.
* '''GX — Globally extinct'''  No recent records despite specific searches.
* '''?'''  Denotes inexact numeric rank (i.e. G4?).
* '''G '''  A "G" (or "T") followed by a blank space means that the conservation data centre has not yet obtained the Global Rank from The Nature Conservancy.
* '''G? — Unranked'''  Or, if following a ranking, rank tentatively assigned (e.g. G3?).
* '''Q'''  Denotes that the taxonomic status of the species, subspecies, or variety is questionable.
* '''T'''  Denotes that the rank applies to a subspecies or variety.

'''Genetic analysis''' is the overall process of studying and [[research]]ing in fields of science that involve [[genetics]] and [[molecular biology]]. There are a number of applications that are developed from this research, and these are also considered parts of the process. The base system of analysis revolves around general genetics. Basic studies include identification of genes and [[inherited disorder]]s. This research has been conducted for centuries on both a large-scale physical observation basis and on a more microscopic scale.
Genetic analysis can be used generally to describe methods both used in and resulting from the sciences of genetics and molecular biology, or to [[applied research|applications]] resulting from this research.

Genetic analysis may be done to identify genetic/inherited disorders and also to make a [[differential diagnosis]] in certain somatic diseases such as [[cancer]]. Genetic analyses of cancer include detection of [[mutation]]s, [[fusion gene]]s, and DNA copy number changes.[[File:FDA microbiologist prepares DNA samples for gel electrophoresis analysis.jpg|thumb|right|FDA microbiologist prepares DNA samples for gel electrophoresis analysis]]

== History of genetic analysis ==
Much of the research that set the foundation of genetic analysis began in prehistoric times. Early humans found that they could practice [[selective breeding]] to improve crops and animals. They also identified inherited traits in humans that were eliminated over the years. The many genetic analyses gradually evolved over time.

=== Mendelian research ===

{{main|Mendelian inheritance}}

Modern genetic analysis began in the mid-1800s with research conducted by [[Gregor Mendel]]. Mendel, who is known as the "father of modern genetics", was inspired to study variation in plants. Between 1856 and 1863, Mendel cultivated and tested some 29,000 pea plants (i.e., Pisum sativum). This study showed that one in four pea plants had purebred recessive alleles, two out of four were hybrid and one out of four were purebred dominant. His experiments led him to make two generalizations, the [[Law of Segregation]] and the [[Law of Independent Assortment]], which later became known as Mendel's Laws of Inheritance. Lacking the basic understanding of heredity, Mendel observed various organisms and first utilized genetic analysis to find that traits were inherited from parents and those traits could vary between children. Later, it was found that units within each cell are responsible for these traits. These units are called genes. Each gene is defined by a series of amino acids that create proteins responsible for genetic traits.

== Various types of genetic analysis ==
'''Genetic analyses''' include molecular technologies such as [[PCR]], [[RT-PCR]], [[DNA sequencing]], and [[DNA microarrays]], and [[cytogenetics|cytogenetic]] methods such as [[karyotyping]] and [[fluorescence in situ hybridisation]].
[[File:Electrophoresis apparatus.jpg|thumb|right|Electrophoresis apparatus]]

=== DNA sequencing ===

[[DNA sequencing]] is essential to the applications of genetic analysis. This process is used to determine the order of [[nucleotide base]]s. Each molecule of DNA is made from [[adenine]], [[guanine]], [[cytosine]] and [[thymine]], which determine what function the genes will possess. This was first discovered during the 1970s. DNA sequencing encompasses biochemical methods for determining the order of the nucleotide bases, adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine, in a DNA oligonucleotide. By generating a DNA sequence for a particular organism, you are determining the patterns that make up genetic traits and in some cases behaviors.

Sequencing methods have evolved from relatively laborious gel-based procedures to modern automated protocols based on dye labelling and detection in capillary [[electrophoresis]] that permit rapid large-scale sequencing of genomes and transcriptomes. Knowledge of DNA sequences of genes and other parts of the genome of organisms has become indispensable for basic research studying biological processes, as well as in applied fields such as diagnostic or forensic research. The advent of DNA sequencing has significantly accelerated biological research and discovery.

=== Cytogenetics ===
'''[[Cytogenetics]]''' is a branch of genetics that is concerned with the study of the structure and function of the cell, especially the chromosomes. [[Polymerase chain reaction]] studies the amplification of DNA. Because of the close analysis of chromosomes in cytogenetics, abnormalities are more readily seen and diagnosed.

==== Karyotyping ====
A [[karyotype]] is the number and appearance of chromosomes in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell. The term is also used for the complete set of chromosomes in a species, or an individual organism.[[File:Karyotype isochromosomeX.JPG|thumb|right|Karyotype of chromosomes]]

Karyotypes describe the number of chromosomes, and what they look like under a light microscope. Attention is paid to their length, the position of the [[centromeres]], banding pattern, any differences between the sex chromosomes, and any other physical characteristics.
'''Karyotyping''' uses a system of studying chromosomes to identify genetic abnormalities and evolutionary changes in the past.

=== DNA microarrays ===
A [[DNA microarray]] is a collection of microscopic DNA spots attached to a solid surface. Scientists use DNA microarrays to measure the expression levels of large numbers of genes simultaneously or to genotype multiple regions of a genome. When a gene is expressed in a cell, it generates [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). Overexpressed genes generate more mRNA than underexpressed genes. This can be detected on the microarray
Since an array can contain tens of thousands of probes, a microarray experiment can accomplish many genetic tests in parallel. Therefore, arrays have dramatically accelerated many types of investigations.

=== PCR ===

{{main|Polymerase chain reaction}}

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a biochemical technology in molecular biology to amplify a single or a few copies of a piece of DNA across several orders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular DNA sequence.
PCR is now a common and often indispensable technique used in medical and biological research labs for a variety of applications. These include [[DNA cloning]] for sequencing, DNA-based [[phylogeny]], or functional analysis of genes; the diagnosis of [[hereditary diseases]]; the identification of genetic fingerprints (used in forensic sciences and paternity testing); and the detection and diagnosis of infectious diseases.

== Practical application ==

===Cancer breakthrough===
Numerous practical advancements have been made in the field of genetics and molecular biology through the processes of genetic analysis. One of the most prevalent advancements during the late 20th and early 21st centuries is a greater understanding of cancer's link to genetics. By identifying which genes in the cancer cells are working abnormally, doctors can better diagnose and treat cancers.

===Possibilities===

This research has been able to identify the concepts of genetic mutations, fusion genes and changes in DNA copy numbers, and advances are made in the field every day. Much of these applications have led to new types of sciences that use the foundations of genetic analysis. Reverse genetics uses the methods to determine what is missing in a genetic code or what can be added to change that code. Genetic linkage studies analyze the spatial arrangements of genes and chromosomes. There have also been studies to determine the legal and social and moral effects of the increase of genetic analysis. Genetic analysis may be done to identify genetic/inherited disorders and also to make a differential diagnosis in certain somatic diseases such as cancer. Genetic analyses of cancer include detection of [[mutation]]s, [[fusion gene]]s, and DNA copy number changes.

The '''glass tax''' was introduced in Great Britain in 1746, during the reign of King [[George II of England|George II]]. Glass was at that time sold by weight, and manufacturers responded by producing smaller, more highly decorated objects, often with hollow stems, known today as "Excise glasses".{{sfnp|Hurst-Vose|1980|p=|ps=none}} In 1780, the government granted Ireland free trade in glass without taxation, resulting in the establishment of glassworks in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and [[Waterford]]. In 1825, the tax in Ireland was restored, and gradually the industry declined, until the glass tax was abolished by Sir [[Robert Peel]]'s government in 1845.{{sfnp|Tait|2004|p=|ps=none}}

A contemporary account in the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' described the glass tax as an "absurd impost on light":
{{quote|In a hygienic point of view, the enormous tax on glass, amounting to more than three hundred per cent on its value, is one of the most cruel a Government could inflict on the nation&amp;nbsp;... The deficiency of light in town habitations, in a great measure caused by the enormous cost of glass, is universally admitted to be one of the principal causes of the unhealthiness of cities ...{{r|Lancet}}}}

'''Heritage interpretation''' refers to all the ways in which information is communicated to visitors to an educational, natural or recreational site, such as a museum, park or science centre. More specifically it is the communication of information about, or the explanation of, the nature, origin, and purpose of historical, natural, or cultural resources, objects, sites and phenomena using personal or non-personal methods.  Some international authorities in [[museology]] prefer the term '''mediation''' for the same concept, following usage in other European languages.

Heritage interpretation may be performed at dedicated [[interpretation centres]] or at [[museum]]s, historic sites, [[parks]], art galleries, nature centres, [[zoos]], [[Public aquarium|aquaria]], [[botanical gardens]], nature reserves and a host of other heritage sites. Its modalities can be extremely varied and may include [[guided walks]], [[Speech|talks]], [[drama]], staffed stations, displays, signs, labels, artwork, brochures, interactives, audio-guides and audio-visual media. The process of developing a structured approach to interpreting these stories, messages and information is called [[interpretive planning]]. The [[Thematic interpretation|thematic approach]] to heritage interpretation advocated by University of Idaho professor Sam Ham, the [[National Association for Interpretation]], the US [[National Park Service]], and others, is considered best practice.&lt;ref name="Brochu (2003)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brochu|first=Lisa|title=Interpretive planning|year=2003|publisher=InterpPress|location=Fort Collins, CO|isbn=1-879931-12-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brochu &amp; Merriman (2002)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brochu|first=Lisa|title=Personal Interpretation: Connecting Your Audience to Heritage Resources|year=2002|publisher=InterpPress|location=Fort Collins, CO|isbn=1-879931-06-0|author2=Merriman, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caputo et al.

Those who practice this form of interpretation may include [[park ranger|rangers]], [[guide]]s, [[Natural history|naturalists]], [[actors]] (who may wear period dress and do reenactments), museum curators, natural and cultural interpretive specialists, interpretation officers, heritage communicators, [[Museum docent|docents]], [[educators]], visitor services staff, interpreters or a host of other titles. The interpretive process is often assisted by new technologies such as visualizing techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Sideris A., 2008.

Interpretation is often used by landowning government agencies and NGOs to promote [[environmental stewardship]] of the lands they manage.

== "Tilden's principles" of interpretation ==

In his 1957 book, "Interpreting Our Heritage", [[Freeman Tilden]] defined six principles of interpretation:
{{quote|
# Any interpretation that does not somehow relate what is being displayed or described to something within the personality or experience of the visitor will be sterile.
# Information, as such, is not Interpretation. Interpretation is revelation based upon information. But they are entirely different things. However all interpretation includes information.
# Interpretation is an art, which combines many arts, whether the materials presented are scientific, historical or architectural. Any art is in some degree teachable.
# The chief aim of Interpretation is not instruction, but provocation.
# Interpretation should aim to present a whole rather than a part, and must address itself to the whole man rather than any phase.
# Interpretation addressed to children (say up to the age of twelve) should not be a dilution of the presentation to adults, but should follow a fundamentally different approach. To be at its best it will require a separate program.}}

For the past 50 years, Tilden's principles have remained highly relevant to interpreters across the world. In 2002 Larry Beck and Ted Cable published "Interpretation for the 21st Century - Fifteen Guiding Principles for Interpreting Nature and Culture", which elaborated upon Tilden's original principles. In 2011, Beck and Cable released a new version of their principles in "The Gift of Interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;Beck, L, Cable,T. (2011) ''The Gifts of Interpretation: Fifteen guiding principles for interpreting nature and culture''.

'''Houghton College''' is a Christian [[liberal arts]] college in [[Houghton, New York|Houghton]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. It is affiliated with the [[Wesleyan Church]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.houghton.edu/about-us/history/ History of Houghton]. Houghton.edu. Retrieved on 2013-06-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The college is a member of both the [[Christian College Consortium]] and the [[Council for Christian Colleges and Universities]].

==History==
Houghton College began in 1883 as Houghton Seminary, a [[coeducation]]al [[high school]] founded by [[Willard J. Houghton]], a [[Wesleyan]] [[Methodist]] minister. In 1899, the first few college classes were offered. James S. Luckey was appointed president in 1908 and Houghton College received its provisional charter from New York in 1923.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; A permanent charter was granted in 1927, and accreditation by the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] came in 1935. [[Stephen W. Paine|Stephen Paine]] was appointed president in 1937.  When the former Buffalo Bible Institute merged with Houghton College in 1969, the West Seneca campus was created.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campus.houghton.edu/orgs/star/issues/Oct%207%202005.pdf ''Houghton Star'', October 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904014808/http://campus.houghton.edu/orgs/star/issues/Oct%207%202005.pdf |date=September 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilber Dayton was appointed president in 1972 and he was succeeded by [[Daniel R. Chamberlain]] in 1976. The college initiated its first [[master’s degree]] program in 2004 and currently offers nine such degrees.  [[Shirley Mullen]] was appointed president in 2006. From 2012 to 2013, the college set new records of giving to the institution for two years in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.houghton.edu/news-media/recent-news/houghton-college-sets-record-giving-second-year-running/284/|title=Houghton College Sets Record Giving, Second Year Running|publisher=Houghton College |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Houghton College faced financial and enrollment challenges which led to academic budget cuts for the 2014–2015 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghtonstar.com/2013/11/09/college-announces-significant-academic-budget-cuts-for-2014-2015/|title=College Announces Significant Academic Budget Cuts for 2014–2015 |first=Sarah|last=Hutchinson |work=Houghton Star |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/12/09/private-colleges-remain-under-weather|title=Private colleges remain under the weather|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a "strategic reallocation of resources"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghton.edu/news-media/recent-news/houghton-announces-strategic-realignment-of-academic-programs/335/|title=Houghton Announces Strategic Realignment of Academic Programs|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the development of several new majors including Music Industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghtonstar.com/2014/12/08/new-music-industry-major/|title=New Music Industry Major |first=Laura |last=Johnson |work=Houghton Star |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports Management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghton.edu/news-media/recent-news/houghton-gets-approval-to-offer-bs-in-sport-recreation-and-wellness-management/586/|title=Houghton Gets Approval to  Offer B.S. in Sport, Recreation and Wellness Management|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Data Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghtonstar.com/2015/01/30/houghton-first-in-nation/|title=Houghton First in Nation to Offer Liberal Arts Data Science Class |first=Luke |last=Lauer |work=Houghton Star |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
Houghton College’s main [[campus]] is in the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of Houghton, in [[Allegany County, New York]], about {{convert|65|mi|km}} southeast of [[Buffalo, New York]] and {{convert|70|mi|km}} southwest of [[Rochester, New York]]. The {{convert|1300|acre|km2}} of campus sit on the [[Allegheny Plateau]] at roughly {{convert|1300|ft|m}}, on the site of the former [[Caneadea]] Indian Reservation. A new Adult Education program offers a B.S. in Management at a variety of locations. Houghton College opened two locations in Niagara County for their Adult Education Program in 2013, in the city of [[Niagara Falls, N.Y.]], and in [[Lockport, N.Y.]]

==Academics==
Houghton College grants two-year and four-year degrees in 46 majors. The college also offers six graduate degrees through the Greatbatch School of Music.

===First Year Honors===
A distinctive First Year Honors Program is for qualified first-year students.  There are three options: London Honors, East Meets West, and Science Honors. Previously the college offered a Contemporary Contexts program, but was replaced by London Honors in 2014. During London Honors, students spend their spring semester in London studying the development of the western world. East Meets West involves taking integrated classes during normal semester then traveling abroad during "May Term", exploring the roots of Western culture. Science Honors takes place during both first-year semesters at Houghton, involving research in recent real-world issues such as fuel-efficiency, climate change, and energy sources. The theme for 2012-13 was [[Global Warming]] and ways in which to improve Houghton's efforts in [[environmentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houghton.edu/academics/Honors-at-Houghton/ Houghton College: Prospective Students Website – Academics – Honors Program]. Explore.houghton.edu. Retrieved on 2012-01-11.&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of this commitment, the school has built one of the largest solar arrays in the state of New York, with a ribbon cutting ceremony on April 17, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghton.edu/calendar-events/solar-array-ribbon-cutting-tour/2426/|title=Solar Array Ribbon Cutting &amp; Tour|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==
There are four traditional residence halls and four townhouses residences. Two of the traditional residence halls, Gillette Hall and Lambein Hall, are female residences. Rothenbuhler Hall and Shenawana Hall are male residences. Sophomore, Junior and senior students have the option to live in the townhouses. Houghton College is a distinctly residential campus but does allow for upper class students the opportunity to apply to live in approved off-campus housing, called Community Living Opportunities (CLOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghton.edu/students/residence-life/college-residences/|title=Residence Life - College Residences|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many organizations and clubs are available for students to join or found their own.  &lt;!-- Detailed lists should not be included, can be found at houghton.edu --&gt;

The Houghton Highlanders field 16 varsity teams. Women participate in [[soccer]], [[basketball]], [[field hockey]], [[lacrosse]], [[softball]], [[tennis]], [[volleyball]], [[track and field|track]], and [[cross country running|cross country]]. Men participate in [[baseball]], [[soccer]], [[basketball]], [[track and field|track]], [[lacrosse]], [[tennis]] and [[cross country running|cross country]].

Houghton is a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletics Association|NCAA]] Division III and member of the [[Empire 8]] Conference.

Houghton's first national champion was Kaitlin Fadden who won the 2008 NAIA Outdoor Track and Field marathon event in a time of 2:57:10.  It was the first NAIA national championship, either for a team or individual,  for Houghton College.

May 2012 graduate Danielle Brenon was the NAIA Outdoor Track and Field national champion in the marathon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghton.edu/news-media/recent-news/brenon-12-is-running-the-distance/141/|title=Brenon '12 is Running the Distance|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the college opened the Kerr-Pegula Athletic Complex thanks to a $12 million gift from 1991 graduate [[Kim Pegula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghton.edu/news/archive.php?p=4710|title=News Archive|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex is named after Kim's father Ralph Kerr, an instructor in Houghton's Adult Education program, and her husband [[Terrence Pegula]]. Three lighted turf facilities are home to the Houghton Highlander soccer, baseball, softball, field hockey, outdoor track, and lacrosse teams. The multipurpose field house includes a eight-lane, 200-meter track and six tennis courts, offering a competition venue for the indoor track and tennis programs. It also provides dedicated practice space for outdoor sports over the winter and during inclement weather and also serve as a hub of involvement for the campus and the surrounding communities of Northern Allegany County and Western New York.

The college also offers club and intramural sports for men and women, including flag football, soccer, volleyball, basketball, and indoor soccer. Co-ed club and intramural sports are handball, water polo, and volleyball. Co-ed frisbee is also a popular sport.

'''Iberulites''' are a particular type of [[microspherulite]]s that develop in the atmosphere ([[troposphere]]), finally falling to the earth's surface. The name comes from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] where they were discovered.&lt;ref name="vr1"&gt;Díaz-Hernández, J.L. (2000). [http://estudiosgeol.revistas.csic.es/index.php/estudiosgeol/article/viewFile/147/146 Aportaciones sólidas a la atmósfera originadas por un incendio forestal en el ámbito mediterráneo]. ''Estudios Geológicos'', '''56''': 153–161&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

An iberulite is a ''co-association'' {{#tag:ref|''Co-association'': heterogeneous mixture of reactive mineral phases. These complex associations are typically formed in nature and are characterized by high surface area, low abundance of metal oxyhydroxide phases, and organic materials that act as cementing agents or surface coatings of prominent mineral grains.&lt;ref&gt;Berstch P. M. y Seaman J. C. (1999). «[http://www.pnas.org/content/96/7/3350.full.pdf+html Characterization of complex mineral assemblages: implications for contaminant transport and environmental remediation]». ''Proceedings National Academy of Sciences USA'', '''96''': 3350–3357&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} with [[wikt:axial|axial]] geometry, consisting of well-defined mineral grains, together with non-crystalline compounds, structured around a [[Granularity|coarse-grained]] core with a [[Clay minerals|smectite]] rind, only one [[vortex]] and pinkish color, formed in the troposphere by complex [[aerosol]]-water-gas interactions.

== Formation ==

=== Shape ===

The aqueous interphase hypothesis has been suggested as the mechanism for tropospheric formation of iberulites:&lt;ref name="vr1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vr2"&gt;Díaz-Hernández, J.L. y Párraga (2008) «[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V66-4SMF02R-2&amp;_user=4628667&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000063621&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=4628667&amp;md5=5843fd2d6d65e0463f855c71151fb906 The nature and tropospheric formation of iberulites: Pinkish mineral microspherulites]». ''Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta'', '''72''': 3883–3906&lt;/ref&gt; interactions between water droplets and Saharan aerosols create complex [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamic]] conditions &lt;ref name="vrs"&gt;Pruppacher H. R. y Klett J. D. (1997). ''Microphysics of clouds and precipitation'' (2ª ed.) Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers. 954 págs.&lt;/ref&gt; causing the possibility of collisions (wake capture and front capture) {{#tag:ref|''Wake capture'': This is a mode of aerodynamic capture of a drop falling in the atmosphere. A large drop settling through smaller drops will sweep out a volume and their hydrodynamic flow fields interfere collecting aerosols/droplets with some efficiency by the wake, depending on size of drops and size of aerosols, being most efficient for large and giant aerosols due to high terminal velocity and cross-sectional area.&lt;ref name="vrs"/&gt;|group=note}} that produce the "precursor water droplets" of the iberulites.&lt;ref name="vr1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vr2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vrs"/&gt; The movement of this water drop to lower tropospheric levels implies either simultaneous or consecutive processes such as [[Coalescence (meteorology)|coalescence]], formation of vortex and [[downdraught]]. During this phase the iberulites acquire their spherical shape and internal structure (core and rind) although this shape can be distorted by adaptation to plant filaments.

=== Compositional attributes ===

The core is mainly formed by grains of [[quartz]], [[calcite]], [[dolomite]] and [[feldspar]]s. The rind shows [[clay minerals]], mainly [[Clay minerals|smectites]] (beidellite, [[montmorillonite]]) and [[illite]], [[sulfate]]s, chlorides and amorphous [[Silicon dioxide|silica]]. The latter group of minerals are mainly neoformed during the maturation process, that occurs in the atmosphere during the final stages of iberulite formation. Flight over areas with volcanic sulfur emissions (North Atlantic archipelagos) {{#tag:ref|''Volcanic sulfur emissions'': Sulfur and other gas emissions into the atmosphere from inside the earth occur near volcanic areas. These emissions can come from both clearly visible (explosive) eruptions and from diffuse (or quiescent) emissions, and there is not a real consensus about the relative importance of the latter. At present, submarine volcanic emissions occur in the [[mid-ocean ridge]]s, and also as [[Volcano|intraplate volcanism]] ([[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]]); subaerial terrestrial volcanism is related with destructive plate margins [[Convergent boundary]], [[Plate tectonics]], ([[Island arc|volcanic arcs]] above [[subduction|subduction zones]]).|group=note}} probably incorporates [[sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] onto the iberulite surface and descent to the ''marine boundary layer'' (MBL)  {{#tag:ref|''Marine boundary layer'': This is defined as that part of the troposphere directly influenced by the presence of the ocean's surface. It reacts with little diurnal variability, is 1–2 km thick (3 km max), has a low [[Bowen ratio]] and a significant wave state. The marine boundary layer (MBL) over the earth's oceans plays a critical role in regulating surface energy and moisture fluxes and in controlling the convective transfer of energy and moisture to the free atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Kloesel, K. A. y Albrecht, B. A. (1989). «[http://ams.allenpress.com/archive/1520-0493/117/1/pdf/i1520-0493-117-1-87.pdf Low-level inversions over the tropical Pacific.

Finally they fall on the southern Iberian Peninsula, where they were found.
[[File:Saharan dusty event.jpg|thumb|Saharan dusty event occurring on August 15, 2005. Notice the change of direction of the plume towards the Cadiz Gulf.]]

=== Maturation ===

In detail, the atmospheric maturation process only occurs on the smectite rind, by means of [[Heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] and multiphase reactions {{#tag:ref|''Multiphase reactions'': These refer to reactions involving components in different phases, and are a combination of simultaneous phase change and conversion of some materials into others. A general multiphase reaction generates three classes of fluxes: component mass sources, interphase mass transfer, interphase energy transfer.|group=note}} producing sulfates as the result of [[Sulfuric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] attack on the minerals of the rind. This would lead to the rapid transformation of some primary minerals into products of atmospheric neoformation {{#tag:ref|''Neoformation'': This is the formation of new mineral species from previously existing ones through alteration of environmental conditions. The new minerals thus produced are therefore stable in the new conditions.|group=note}} secondary minerals): the sulfates (mainly the [[gypsum]]) would be the product of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; attack on the interlayer cations of the smectites, which would gradually destroy the octahedral and tetrahedral {{#tag:ref|''Tetrahedral, octahedral and interlayer sheets'': The basic structural feature of the phyllosilicates is the stack of three types of layers: the tetrahedral sheet is formed by SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra, and each tetrahedron shares three of its vertex oxygen atoms with other tetrahedra and in which the Al can substitute up to half the Si. The octahedral sheet is made up by the Al, Fe and Mg cations, in six-coordination with the O and OH anions. Depending on the composition of the tetrahedral and octahedral sheets, the layer will have no charge, or will have a net negative charge. If the layers are charged this charge is balanced by interlayer cations such as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. In each case the interlayer can also contain water. The crystal structure is formed from a stack of layers interspaced with the interlayers.|group=note}} sheets of [[Silicate minerals#Phyllosilicates|phyllosilicates]] creating mixed sulfates.

The [[alunite]] - [[jarosite]] found in the smectite rind would have a similar origin. If acid attack progresses further, the phyllosilicate grains would be completely destroyed, producing amorphous silica and releasing [[Iron|Fe]]. Since [[biogenic]] exoskeletons have no signs of [[corrosion]], they must have been incorporated after the acid attack described above, probably simultaneously with the incorporation of sea salt.

=== Formation environment ===

Iberulites are linked to the evolution of high-dust air masses (plumes) which, originating in Saharan dust storms, are transported over the Iberian Peninsula and often across the eastern North Atlantic Ocean. These plumes occur in the warm season (May to September), as a result of anticyclonic activity affecting the Iberian Peninsula, and only sporadically in spring and autumn.

==Abnormalities==
In the [[dog whelk]], the growth of a penis in imposex females gradually blocks the [[oviduct]], although [[ovule]] production continues. An imposex female dog whelk passes through several stages of penis growth before it becomes unable to maintain a constant production of ovules. Later stages of imposex lead to [[Infertility|sterility]] and the premature death of the females of reproductive age, which can adversely affect the entire [[population]].&lt;ref name="Castro"/&gt;

==Biomonitoring==

The imposex stages of female dog whelks and other molluscs (including ''[[Nucella lima]]'') are used in the United Kingdom and worldwide to [[biomonitoring|monitor]] levels of tributyltin. The RPSI (Relative Penis Size Index) of females to males, and the VDSI (Vas Deferens Sequence Index) are used to monitor levels of tributyltin in [[marine environment]]s.

On September 29, 2007, the [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], newspaper ''The Chronicle Herald'' featured a story on female dog whelks on the shores of Halifax Harbour and other parts of Nova Scotia, where they live on the beach in the [[intertidal zone]]. The report stated that female dog whelks still grow penises even after a ban on tributyltin.&lt;ref&gt;"Tiny Snail, Big Problem" The Chronicle Herald, Halifax, NS, Canada.

[[File:KM3NeT logo.jpg|thumb|KM3NeT logo]]

The '''Cubic Kilometre Neutrino Telescope''', or '''KM3NeT''', is a future European [[research]] infrastructure that will be located at the bottom of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It will host the next-generation [[neutrino astronomy|neutrino telescope]] in the form of a water [[Cherenkov detector]] with an instrumented volume of about five cubic kilometres distributed over three locations in the Mediterranean: KM3NeT-Fr (off [[Toulon]], France), KM3NeT-It (off [[Portopalo di Capo Passero]], Sicily, Italy) and KM3NeT-Gr (off [[Pylos]], Peloponnese, Greece).

KM3NeT will search for [[neutrino]]s from distant astrophysical sources like [[supernova remnant]]s, [[gamma-ray burst]]s, [[supernova]]e or colliding stars and will be a powerful tool in the search for [[dark matter]] in the universe. Its prime objective is to detect neutrinos from sources in our galaxy. Arrays of thousands of optical sensor modules will detect the faint light in the deep sea from charged particles originating from collisions of the neutrinos and the water or rock in the vicinity of the detector. The research infrastructure will also house instrumentation for other sciences like [[marine biology]], [[oceanography]] and [[geophysics]] for long-term and on-line monitoring of the deep-sea environment and the sea bottom at depth of several kilometres.

Once completed, the KM3NeT research infrastructure will consists of seven large subdetectors. Six of these will indeed form the telescope searching neutrino-sources. The seventh subdetector will be optimised to measure the properties of the neutrino itself. In that sense, the latter detector is a neutrino particle physics detector.

== Design ==
[[File:KM3NeT DOM in the lab.jpg|thumb|KM3NeT Digital Optical Module (DOM) in the laboratory]]

The full neutrino telescope will contain on the order of 12000 pressure-resistant glass spheres attached to about 600 strings.  The strings hold 18 sensor spheres each, anchored to the sea floor and supported by floats.  Each sphere, called a "digital optical module" (DOM), is about {{convert|17|in|cm}} in diameter, contains 31 {{convert|3|in|cm|adj=on}} [[photomultiplier]] tubes with supporting electronics, and is connected to shore via a high-bandwidth optical network.

At the shore of each KM3NeT installation site, a farm of computers will perform the first data filter in the search for the signal of cosmic neutrinos, prior to streaming the data to a central KM3NeT data centre for storage and further analysis by the KM3NeT scientists.

The KM3NeT-It site, at a depth of 3400&amp;nbsp;m, hosts the ARCA (''Astroparticle Research with Cosmics in the Abyss'') detector, with more widely spaced DOMs optimised for detecting high-energy cosmic neutrinos in the TeV–PeV range.  Its strings are 650&amp;nbsp;m long, spaced 90&amp;nbsp;m apart.&lt;ref name=neutrino2016a&gt;{{Cite conference |url=http://neutrino2016.iopconfs.org/IOP/media/uploaded/EVIOP/event_948/15.10_Kouchner.pdf |title=High-energy neutrino searches in the Mediterranean Sea: probing the Universe with ANTARES and KM3NeT/ARCA |first=Antoine |last=Kouchner |date=4 July 2016 |location=London |conference=XXVII International Conference on Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics |conference-url=http://neutrino2016.iopconfs.org/programme}} Video available at {{youtube|id=LC_3yNbtrJE|Neutrino Conference 2016 - Monday (part 1)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|3}}&lt;ref name=neutrino2016b /&gt;{{Rp|21}}

The KM3NeT-Fr site, at a depth of 2475&amp;nbsp;m, hosts the ORCA (''Oscillation Research with Cosmics in the Abyss'') detector, a more compact array with more closely spaced sensors optimised for atmospheric neutrinos in the GeV range.  This will consist of 115 strings in a 20&amp;nbsp;m triangular grid, with a 9&amp;nbsp;m spacing between the DOMs in a string.  Overall, the array is about 210&amp;nbsp;m in diameter, and the strings are 200&amp;nbsp;m long.&lt;ref name=neutrino2016b&gt;{{Cite conference |url=http://neutrino2016.iopconfs.org/IOP/media/uploaded/EVIOP/event_948/12.05__3__COYLE__wednesday_update_online.pdf |title=Neutrino mass hierarchy determination with KM3NeT/ORCA |first=Paschal |last=Coyle |date=6 July 2016 |location=London |conference=XXVII International Conference on Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics |conference-url=http://neutrino2016.iopconfs.org/programme}} Video available at {{youtube|id=gJvN0o7e9VU#t=70m58s|Neutrino Conference 2016 - Wednesday (part 2)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|6}}

== Construction ==
In 2012, the first phase of the implementation of the KM3NeT research facility has started with the construction of the seabed infrastructure at the KM3NeT-Fr and KM3NeT-It sites. A prototype KM3NeT Digital Optical Module (KM3NeT-DOM) has been taking data successfully for more than a year as part of the [[ANTARES (telescope)|ANTARES]] telescope. The KM3NeT-Fr installation site close to the ANTARES telescope is being prepared for the installation in 2016 of the first strings for the KM3NeT/ORCA detector for neutrino particle physics. At the KM3NET-It site the first prototype KM3NeT-string successfully took data for about a year. This site is being prepared for the installation of the first full strings starting end of 2015.  

== Relation to other neutrino telescopes ==
For the design of the neutrino detector, KM3NeT builds on the experience of three pilot projects in the Mediterranean Sea: the [[ANTARES (telescope)|ANTARES]] detector, the Neutrino Mediterranean Observatory (NEMO) project and the [[NESTOR Project]]. ANTARES was completed on 30 May 2008, and is the largest neutrino telescope in the northern hemisphere. In the southern hemisphere, at Antarctica, the [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory]] is already operational. Together, IceCube and KM3NeT will view the full sky and form a global neutrino observatory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3764">This is a '''list of musicology topics'''. [[Musicology]] is the scholarly study of [[music]]. A person who studies music is a musicologist. The word is used in narrow, intermediate and broad senses. In the narrow sense, musicology is confined to the music history of [[Western culture]]. In the intermediate sense, it includes all relevant cultures and a range of musical forms, styles, genres and traditions, but tends to be confined to the [[humanities]] - a combination of historical musicology, [[ethnomusicology]], and the humanities of systematic musicology ([[philosophy]], [[Sociological theory|theoretical sociology]], [[aesthetics]]). In the broad sense, it includes all musically relevant [[Discipline (specialism)|disciplines]] (both humanities and [[science]]s) and all manifestations of music in all [[culture]]s, so it also includes all of systematic musicology (including [[psychology]], [[biology]], and [[computing]]).

Professional institutions are the societies and associations, they help develop and promote a career and the people who practice in it. There are many chartered professional institutes in the UK, over 80, that cover many different areas of work. The different areas of work that are covered includes constructions, health, journalism, personnel, finance, engineering, law and of course, management. The professional institutes can help you both before and after you graduate.&lt;ref&gt;http://targetjobs.co.uk/professional-qualification-and-accreditation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
There are institutes that have websites that you're able to sign up to, where they help you with your development and challenges within the professional institutes. One of the websites that provides this service is http://www.managers.org.uk/ the Chartered Management Institute. You are able to attend events and take courses based on many different types of institutes in management and learn about development, these would include: Leadership event, Building a business event, Visionary leaders event, Introduction to Management course and Essential management skills course. They say that they are the only Awarding Body that are able to award Chartered Manager status, which is the ultimate management accolade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.managers.org.uk/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Refimprove|date=October 2015}}

Different institutes have different ways of helping you further in your career, such as learning styles. The institutes would assess you, and how they assess you would be individual to the institute; it would most likely be based on your education, knowledge, skills and experience. They might also have different ways of grading and awarding points, as well as different types of membership that you're able to have; some institutes have one day programs, monthly programs and even group programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://ims-online.com/membership.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Management is a major factor in all careers, it consists of organising, controlling, planning and also, directing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/management.html&lt;/ref&gt; Management is at the top of hierarchy as it is what controls everything else within a company/business. If there is no management, then there would be no order or organisation within a company, this would result in the company not being successful. This is why institutes for management would be important and very useful.

There are many different areas of work that go into management; it expands into many different sectors due to how broad management is. Some of the different types of management includes, '''Accounting''' management, '''Business''' management and '''Marketing''' management.

==Institutes==
An institute is an organisation that has a particular purpose, in this case, the purpose is for further and higher education;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=institute+definition&lt;/ref&gt; some higher education institutions hold university statues'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/0729436052000318569 | volume=24 | title=Occupational stress in UK higher education institutions: a comparative study of all staff categories | journal=Higher Education Research &amp; Development | pages=41–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher education institutions need to have a distinct image that they should maintain and also to develop, this would be so that they can create a competitive advantage as the market is increasingly competitive.&lt;ref&gt;Paramewaran, R, and Glowacka, AE. (1995), “University image: an information processing perspective”, Journal of Marketing for Higher Education, Vol. 6 No. 2, pp. 41‐56.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a tertiary education system that is undergoing fundamental metamorphosis, this is both in the UK and South Africa; they are both facing changes in government funding. There are at least 71 different institutes that are represented in the UK and at least 20 different institutions from South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Ivy, (2001) "Higher education institution image: acorrespondence analysis approach", International Journal of Educational Management, Vol. 15 Iss: 6, pp.276 - 282&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a company website called 'IMD World Competitiveness Centre', they have a partnership with institutes and have a worldwide network. They have partner institutes in 55 countries; the IMD World Competitiveness Centre helps with '''business''', academics highlight competitive advantage, governments and undercover opportunities by offering a range of products and services which includes workshops and economy assessments. They have partner institutes in Africa/Middle East and they include in Israel, Jordan, Qatar, South Africa and United Arab Emirates. Partner Institutes in America includes, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela. In Asia/Pacific they include Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. Lastly, in Europe they include, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Ireland, Romania, Russia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imd.org/wcc/wcc-partner/#tab=2&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are institutes that are profitable, there are also institutes that are not profitable. In the UK, there is an institute called 'Project Management Institute' and it is the world's leading non profitable professional membership association. It was founded in 1969 and it delivers value for more than 2.9 million professionals that work in nearly every country, they advance careers and improve organisational success.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pmi.org/About-Us.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==UK==
The UK government policies dictate that education in higher education institutes look to profit-making organisations for models that would help with performance improvement (Galloway, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, L. (1998), “Quality perceptions of internal and external customers: a case study in education administration”, The TQM Magazine, Vol. 10 No 1, pp. 20‐6.&lt;/ref&gt; This would mean that there is a need for strengthening of the partnership between educational institutes and business.

'''Luis von Ahn''' ({{IPA-es|ˈlwis fon ˈan|lang}}; born 19 August 1978) is a Guatemalan entrepreneur and a Consulting Professor in the [[Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science|Computer Science Department]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luis von Ahn|url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/directory/lav|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known as one of the pioneers of [[crowdsourcing]]. He is the founder of the company [[reCAPTCHA]], which was sold to [[Google]] in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teaching computers to read: Google acquires reCAPTCHA|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2009/09/teaching-computers-to-read-google.html|accessdate=13 August 2015|work=Google Official Blog|date=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the co-founder and CEO of [[Duolingo]], a popular language-learning platform.

== Biography ==
Von Ahn was born in and grew up in [[Guatemala City]]. He is of [[German Guatemalan]] descent.

He received his [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] in Mathematics (''[[summa cum laude]]'') from [[Duke University]] in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.duke.edu/people/profiles/individual/2010_luis_von_ahn/|title=Duke Ugrad Alum Profile: Luis von Ahn|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Duke University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201162052/http://www.cs.duke.edu/people/profiles/individual/2010_luis_von_ahn/|archive-date=17 February 2017|dead-url=|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later got his [[PhD]] in Computer Science at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/LuisvonAhn_CV.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Von Ahn became a faculty member at the [[Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://triblive.com/local/allegheny/14071844-74/duolingo-ceo-luis-von-ahn-wins-500k-lemelson-prize-from-mit|title=Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn wins $500K Lemelson prize from MIT|last=Federoff|first=Stacey|website=TribLIVE.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
As a professor, his research includes [[CAPTCHA]]s and [[Human-based computation|human computation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Robert J.

''[[Siglo Veintiuno]]'', one of the biggest newspapers in Guatemala, chose him as the person of the year in 2009. In 2011, [[Foreign Policy Magazine]] in Spanish named him the most influential intellectual of Latin America and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Los 10 nuevos rostros del pensiamento iberoamericano|url=http://www.fp-es.org/los-10-nuevos-rostros-del-pensamiento-iberoamericano|accessdate=14 August 2015|work=FP|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529100941/http://www.fp-es.org/los-10-nuevos-rostros-del-pensamiento-iberoamericano|archivedate=29 May 2011|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Ahn's early research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luis von Ahn|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=luis+von+ahn|publisher=Google Scholar|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was in the field of [[cryptography]]. With Nicholas J. Hopper and [[John Langford (computer scientist)|John Langford]], he was the first to provide rigorous definitions of [[steganography]] and to prove that private-key steganography is possible.

In 2000, he did early pioneering work with [[Manuel Blum]] on CAPTCHAs,&lt;ref&gt;Von Ahn, Luis; Blum, Manuel; Hopper, Nicholas J.; Langford, John (May 2003). "CAPTCHA: Using Hard AI Problems for Security". Proceedings of the International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques (EUROCRYPT 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; computer-generated tests that humans are routinely able to pass but that computers have not yet mastered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Von Ahn | first1 = L. | last2 = Blum | first2 = M. | last3 = Langford | first3 = J. | doi = 10.1145/966389.966390 | title = Telling humans and computers apart automatically | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 56–60 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These devices are used by web sites to prevent automated programs, or bots, from perpetrating large-scale abuse, such as automatically registering for large numbers of accounts or purchasing huge numbers of tickets for resale by scalpers. CAPTCHAs brought von Ahn his first widespread fame among the general public due to their coverage in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' and ''[[USA Today]]'' and on the [[Discovery Channel]], [[NOVA scienceNOW]], and other mainstream outlets.

Von Ahn's Ph.D. thesis, completed in 2005, was the first publication to use the term "[[Human-based computation|human computation]]" that he had coined, referring to methods that combine human brainpower with computers to solve problems that neither could solve alone. Von Ahn's Ph.D. thesis is also the first work on [[Game with a purpose|Games With A Purpose]], or GWAPs, which are games played by humans that produce useful computation as a side effect. The most famous example is the [[ESP Game]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Von Ahn | first1 = L. | last2 = Dabbish | first2 = L. | doi = 10.1145/985692.985733 | chapter = Labeling images with a computer game | title = Proceedings of the 2004 conference on Human factors in computing systems  - CHI '04 | pages = 319–326 | year = 2004 | isbn = 1581137028 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; an online game&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Von Ahn | first1 = L. | title = Games with a Purpose | doi = 10.1109/MC.2006.196 | journal = Computer | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 92–94 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which two randomly paired people are simultaneously shown the same picture, with no way to communicate. Each then lists a number of words or phrases that describe the picture within a time limit, and are rewarded with points for a match. This match turns out to be an accurate description of the picture, and can be successfully used in a database for more accurate image search technology. The ESP Game was licensed by Google in the form of the [[Google Image Labeler]], and is used to improve the accuracy of the [[Google Image Search]]. Von Ahn's games brought him further coverage in the mainstream media. His thesis won the Best Doctoral Dissertation Award from Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science.
In July 2006, von Ahn gave a tech talk at Google on "Human Computation" (i.e., crowdsourcing) which was watched by over one million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx082gDwGcM Google Tech Talk on human computation by Luis von Ahn]. youtube.com (2006-07-26). Retrieved on 2015-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, von Ahn invented [[reCAPTCHA]], a new form of [[CAPTCHA]] that also helps digitize books. In reCAPTCHA, the images of words displayed to the user come directly from old books that are being digitized; they are words that [[optical character recognition]] could not identify and are sent to people throughout the web to be identified. ReCAPTCHA is currently in use by over 100,000 web sites and is transcribing over 40 million words per day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/techtonicshifts/archive/2009/11/13/recaptcha-a-k-a-those-infernal-squiggly-words-almost-done-digitizing-the-new-york-times-archive.aspx reCAPTCHA (a.k.a.

The [[small molecule]] chemicals found in a given metabolome may include both endogenous [[metabolites]] that are naturally produced by an [[organism]] (such as [[amino acids]], [[organic acids]], [[nucleic acids]], [[fatty acids]], [[amines]], [[sugars]], [[vitamins]], [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|co-factors]], [[pigments]], [[antibiotics]], etc.) as well as exogenous chemicals (such as drugs, [[environmental contaminant]]s, [[food additives]], [[toxins]] and other [[xenobiotics]]) that are not naturally produced by an organism.&lt;ref name=ref_17626065&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wishart|first=DS|title=Current progress in computational metabolomics|journal=Brief Bioinform.|date=September 2007|volume=8|issue=5|pages=279–93|pmid=17626065|doi=10.1093/bib/bbm030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref_16689529&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nordström|first=A|author2=O'Maille G |author3=Qin C |author4=Siuzdak G. |title=Nonlinear data alignment for UPLC-MS and HPLC-MS based metabolomics: quantitative analysis of endogenous and exogenous metabolites in human serum|journal=Anal.

The endogenous metabolome can be further subdivided to include a "primary" and a "secondary" metabolome (particularly when referring to plant or microbial metabolomes). A [[primary metabolite]] is directly involved in the normal growth, development, and reproduction. A [[secondary metabolite]] is not directly involved in those processes, but usually has important ecological function.  [[Secondary metabolites]] may include [[pigments]], [[antibiotics]] or waste products derived from partially metabolized [[xenobiotics]]. To qualify as a [[metabolite]], or to be considered to be part of the metabolome, a [[small molecule]] must typically have a [[molecular weight]] &lt;1500 Da.&lt;ref name=ref_17626065 /&gt; This means that molecules such as [[glycolipids]], [[polysaccharides]], short [[peptides]] (&lt;14 amino acids) and small [[oligonucleotides]] (&lt;5 bases) can be regarded as [[metabolites]] or constituents of the metabolome. On the other hand, very large [[macromolecules]] such as [[proteins]], [[messenger RNA]], [[ribosomal RNA]], [[microRNA]] and [[DNA]] are definitely not [[metabolites]] and are not considered to be part of the metabolome. The study of the metabolome is called [[metabolomics]].

==Origins==
The word metabolome appears to be a blending of the words “[[metabolite]]” and “[[chromosome]]”. It was constructed to imply that [[metabolites]] are indirectly encoded by genes or act on genes and gene products.  The term “metabolome” was first used in 1998 &lt;ref name=ref_9744112 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref_9748443&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tweeddale|first=H|author2=Notley-McRobb L |author3=Ferenci T. |title=Effect of slow growth on metabolism of Escherichia coli, as revealed by global metabolite pool ("metabolome") analysis.|journal=J. Bacteriol.|date=Oct 1998|volume=180|issue=19|pages=5109–16|pmid=9748443|pmc=107546}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was likely coined to match with existing biological terms referring to the complete set of genes (the [[genome]]), the complete set of proteins (the [[proteome]]) and the complete set of transcripts (the [[transcriptome]]). The first book on [[metabolomics]] was published in 2003.&lt;ref name=book_Harrigan&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrigan, G. G. &amp; Goodacre, R. (eds)|title=Metabolic Profiling: Its Role in Biomarker Discovery and Gene Function Analysis.|date=2003|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-4020-7370-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first journal dedicated to metabolomics (titled simply “Metabolomics”) was launched in 2005 and is currently edited by Dr. Royston Goodacre.

==Measuring the metabolome==
The metabolome reflects the interaction between an organism’s genome and its environment.  As a result, an organism’s metabolome can serve as an excellent probe of its [[phenotype]] (i.e. the product of its [[genotype]] and its environment). [[Metabolites]] can be measured (identified, quantified or classified) using a number of different technologies including [[NMR spectroscopy]] and [[mass spectrometry]].  Most [[mass spectrometry]] (MS) methods must be coupled to various forms of [[liquid chromatography]] (LC), [[gas chromatography]] (GC) or [[capillary electrophoresis]] (CE) to facilitate compound separation. Each method is typically able to identify or characterize 50-5000 different metabolites or metabolite “features” at a time, depending on the instrument or protocol being used. See Figure 2 for an illustration of the relationship between different analytical methods and their sensitivity.  Currently it is not possible to analyze the entire range of metabolites by a single analytical method.

[[NMR spectroscopy|Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy]] is an analytical chemistry technique that measures the absorption of [[radiofrequency]] radiation of specific nuclei when molecules containing those nuclei are placed in strong [[magnetic fields]].  The frequency (i.e. the [[chemical shift]]) at which a given atom or nucleus absorbs is highly dependent on the chemical environment (bonding, chemical structure nearest neighbours, solvent) of that atom in a given molecule.  The NMR absorption patterns produce “resonance” peaks at different frequencies or different chemical shifts – this collection of peaks is called a [[NMR spectrum]]. Because each chemical compound has a different chemical structure, each compound will have a unique (or almost unique) [[NMR spectrum]].  As a result, NMR is particularly useful for the characterization, identification and quantification of small molecules, such as metabolites. The widespread use of NMR for “classical” metabolic studies, along with its exceptional capacity to handle complex metabolite mixtures is likely the reason why NMR was one of the first technologies to be widely adopted for routine metabolome measurements.  As an analytical technique, NMR is non-destructive, non-biased, easily quantifiable, requires little or no separation, permits the identification of novel compounds and it needs no chemical derivatization.  NMR is particularly amenable to detecting compounds that are less tractable to [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] analysis, such as sugars, amines or volatile liquids or [[GC-MS]] analysis, such as large molecules (&gt;500 Da) or relatively non-reactive compounds.  NMR is not a very sensitive technique with a lower limit of detection of about 5 µM.  Typically 50-150 compounds can be identified by NMR-based metabolomic studies.

[[Mass spectrometry]] is an analytical technique that measures the [[mass-to-charge ratio]] of molecules.  Molecules or molecular fragments are typically charged or ionized by spraying them through a charged field ([[electrospray ionization]]), bombarding them with electrons from a hot filament ([[electron ionization]]) or blasting them with a laser when they are placed on specially coated plates (matrix assisted laser desorption ionization).  The charged molecules are then propelled through space using electrodes or magnets and their speed, rate of curvature, or other physical characteristics are measured to determine their [[mass-to-charge ratio]].  From these data the mass of the parent molecule can be determined.  Further fragmentation of the molecule through controlled collisions with gas molecules or with electrons can help determine the structure of molecules. Very accurate mass measurements can also be used to determine the elemental formulas or elemental composition of compounds.  Most forms of mass spectrometry require some form of separation using [[liquid chromatography]] or [[gas chromatography]].  This separation step is required to simplify the resulting mass spectra and to permit more accurate compound identification.  Some [[mass spectrometry]] methods also require that the molecules be derivatized or chemically modified so that they are more amenable for [[chromatographic]] separation (this is particularly true for [[GC-MS]]).  As an analytical technique, MS is a very sensitive method that requires very little sample (&lt;1&amp;nbsp;ng of material or &lt;10 µL of a biofluid) and can generate signals for 1000s of metabolites from a single sample. MS instruments can also be configured for very high throughput metabolome analyses (100s to 1000s of samples a day).  Quantification of metabolites and the characterization of novel compound structures is more difficult by MS than by NMR. [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] is particularly amenable to detecting hydrophobic molecules ([[lipids]], [[fatty acids]]) and [[peptides]] while [[GC-MS]] is best for detecting [[small molecules]] (&lt;500 Da) and highly volatile compounds ([[esters]], [[amines]], [[ketones]], [[alkanes]], [[thiols]]).

Unlike the [[genome]] or even the [[proteome]], the metabolome is a highly dynamic entity that can change dramatically, over a period of just seconds or minutes. As a result, there is growing interest in measuring metabolites over multiple time periods or over short time intervals using modified versions of NMR or MS-based metabolomics.

==Metabolome databases==
Because an organism’s metabolome is largely defined by its [[genome]], different species will have different metabolomes.  Indeed, the fact that the metabolome of a tomato is different than the metabolome of an apple is the reason why these two fruits taste so different.   Furthermore, different tissues, different [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and [[biofluids]] associated with those organs and [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] can also have distinctly different metabolomes.  The fact that different organisms and different [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]/[[biofluids]] have such different metabolomes has led to the development of a number of organism-specific of biofluid-specific metabolome databases.  Some of the better known metabolome databases include the [[Human Metabolome Database]] or [[HMDB]],&lt;ref name=ref_17202168&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wishart|first=DS|author2=Tzur D |author3=Knox C |title=HMDB: the Human Metabolome Database|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=January 2007|volume=35|issue=Database issue|pages=D521–6|doi=10.1093/nar/gkl923|pmid=17202168|pmc=1899095|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[YMDB|the Yeast Metabolome Database]] or [[YMDB]],&lt;ref name=ref_22064855&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jewison T, Neveu V, Lee J, Knox C, Liu P, Mandal R, Murthy RK, Sinelnikov I, Guo AC, Wilson M, Djoumbou Y, Wishart DS |title=The Yeast Metabolome Database.|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=Jan 2012|volume=40|issue=Database issue|pages=D815–20|doi=10.1093/nar/gkr916|pmid=22064855|pmc=3245085}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[E.

===The Human Metabolome Database===
The [[Human Metabolome Database]] is a freely available, open-access database containing detailed data on more than 40,000 metabolites that have already been identified or are likely to be found in the human body. The [[HMDB]] contains three kinds of information: 1) chemical information, 2) clinical information, and 3) biochemical information. The chemical data includes &gt;40,000 metabolite structures with detailed descriptions, extensive chemical classifications, synthesis information and observed/calculated chemical properties.  It also contains nearly 10,000 experimentally measured [[NMR]], [[GC-MS]] and [[LC/MS]] spectra from more than 1100 different metabolites. The clinical information includes data on &gt;10,000 [[metabolite]]-[[biofluid]] concentrations, metabolite concentration information on more than 600 different human diseases and pathway data for more than 200 different inborn errors of metabolism. The biochemical information includes nearly 6000 protein (and DNA) sequences and more than 5000 biochemical reactions that are linked to these metabolite entries.  The [[HMDB]] supports a wide variety of online queries including text searches, chemical structure searches, sequence similarity searches and spectral similarity searches.  This makes it particularly useful for metabolomic researchers who are attempting to identify or understand metabolites in clinical metabolomic studies. The first version of the [[HMDB]] was released in Jan. 1 2007 and was compiled by scientists at the [[University of Alberta]] and the [[University of Calgary]]. At that time they reported data on 2,500 [[metabolites]], 1,200 drugs and 3,500 food components. Since then these scientists have greatly expanded the collection. The latest version of the [[HMDB]] (version 3.5) contains &gt;16,000 endogenous metabolites, &gt;1500 drugs and &gt;22,000 food constituents or food metabolites.&lt;ref name=ref_23161693&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wishart DS, Jewison T, Guo AC, Wilson M, Knox C, Liu Y, Djoumbou Y, Mandal R, Aziat F, Dong E, Bouatra S, Sinelnikov I, Arndt D, Xia J, Liu P, Yallou F, Bjorndahl T, Perez-Pineiro R, Eisner R, Allen F, Neveu V, Greiner R, Scalbert A |title=HMDB 3.0--The Human Metabolome Database in 2013|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=41|issue=Database issue|pages=D801–7|doi=10.1093/nar/gks1065|pmid=23161693|pmc=3531200|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Human biofluid metabolomes====
Scientists at the [[University of Alberta]] have been systematically characterizing specific biofluid metabolomes including the serum metabolome,&lt;ref name="ref_21359215" /&gt; the urine metabolome,&lt;ref name="ref_24023812" /&gt; the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) metabolome &lt;ref name="ref_22546835" /&gt; and the saliva metabolome.  These efforts have involved both experimental metabolomic analysis (involving [[NMR]], [[GC-MS]], [[ICP-MS]], [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] and [[HPLC]] assays) as well as extensive literature mining.  According to their data, the human serum metabolome contains at least 4200 different compounds (including many lipids), the human urine metabolome contains at least 3000 different compounds (including 100s of volatiles and gut microbial metabolites), the human [[Cerebrospinal fluid|CSF]] metabolome contains nearly 500 different compounds while the human saliva metabolome contains approximately 400 different metabolites, including many bacterial products.

===Yeast Metabolome Database===
The [[Yeast Metabolome Database]] is a freely accessible, online database of &gt;2000 small molecule metabolites found in or produced by [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]] ([[Baker’s yeast]]). The [[YMDB]] contains two kinds of information: 1) chemical information and 2) biochemical information. The chemical information in YMDB includes 2027 metabolite structures with detailed metabolite descriptions, extensive chemical classifications, synthesis information and observed/calculated chemical properties. It also contains nearly 4000 [[NMR]], [[GC-MS]] and [[LC/MS]] spectra obtained from more than 500 different metabolites. The biochemical information in [[YMDB]] includes &gt;1100 protein (and DNA) sequences and &gt;900 biochemical reactions. The [[YMDB]] supports a wide variety of queries including text searches, chemical structure searches, sequence similarity searches and spectral similarity searches.  This makes it particularly useful for metabolomic researchers who are studying yeast as a model organism or who are looking into optimizing the production of fermented beverages (wine, beer).

===The Escherichia coli Metabolome Database===
The [[E. Coli Metabolome Database]] is a freely accessible, online database of &gt;2700 small molecule metabolites found in or produced by [[Escherichia coli]] (E. coli strain K12, MG1655).  The [[E. Coli Metabolome Database|ECMDB]] contains two kinds of information: 1) chemical information and 2) biochemical information. The chemical information includes more than 2700 metabolite structures with detailed metabolite descriptions, extensive chemical classifications, synthesis information and observed/calculated chemical properties.  It also contains nearly 5000 [[NMR]], [[GC/MS|GC-MS]] and [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] spectra from more than 600 different metabolites. The biochemical information includes &gt;1600 protein (and DNA) sequences and &gt;3100 biochemical reactions that are linked to these metabolite entries. The [[E. Coli Metabolome Database|ECMDB]] supports many different types of online queries including text searches, chemical structure searches, sequence similarity searches and spectral similarity searches.  This makes it particularly useful for metabolomic researchers who are studying [[E. coli]] as a model organism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20537">'''Modularity of mind''' is the notion that a [[mind]] may, at least in part, be composed of innate neural structures or modules which have distinct established [[evolution]]arily developed functions. Somewhat different definitions of "module" have been proposed by different authors.

==Early investigations==
Historically, questions regarding the ''functional architecture'' of the mind have been divided into two different theories of the nature of the faculties. The first can be characterized as a horizontal view because it refers to mental processes as if they are interactions between faculties such as memory, imagination, judgement, and perception, which are not [[domain specificity|domain specific]] (e.g., a judgement remains a judgement whether it refers to a perceptual experience or to the conceptualization/comprehension process). The second can be characterized as a vertical view because it claims that the mental faculties are differentiated on the basis of domain specificity, are genetically determined, are associated with distinct neurological structures, and are computationally autonomous.

The vertical vision goes back to the 19th century movement called [[phrenology]] and its founder [[Franz Joseph Gall]], who claimed that the individual mental faculties could be associated precisely, in a sort of one-to-one correspondence, with specific physical areas of the brain. Hence, someone's level of intelligence, for example, could be literally "read off" from the size of a particular bump on his posterior parietal lobe. This simplistic view of modularity has been disproven over the course of the last century.

==Fodor's ''Modularity of Mind''==
In the 1980s, however, [[Jerry Fodor]] revived the idea of the modularity of mind, although without the notion of precise physical localizability. Drawing from [[Noam Chomsky]]'s idea of the [[language acquisition device]] and other work in [[linguistics]] as well as from the [[philosophy of mind]] and the implications of [[optical illusion]]s, he became a major proponent of the idea with the 1983 publication of ''Modularity of Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, Jerry A. (1983). ''Modularity of Mind: An Essay on Faculty Psychology''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-56025-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fodor, a module falls somewhere between the behaviorist and cognitivist views of lower-level processes.

[[Behaviorism|Behaviorists]] tried to replace the mind with reflexes which Fodor describes as encapsulated (cognitively impenetrable or unaffected by other cognitive domains) and non-inferential (straight pathways with no information added). Low level processes are unlike reflexes in that they are inferential. This can be demonstrated by [[argument from poverty of the stimulus|poverty of the stimulus]] arguments in which the proximate stimulus, that which is initially received by the brain (such as the 2D image received by the retina), cannot account for the resulting output (for example, our 3D perception of the world), thus necessitating some form of computation.

In contrast, [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivists]] saw lower level processes as continuous with higher level processes, being inferential and cognitively penetrable (influenced by other cognitive domains, such as beliefs). The latter has been shown to be untrue in some cases, such as with many visual illusions (ex. [[Müller-Lyer illusion]]), which can persist despite a person's awareness of their existence. This is taken to indicate that other domains, including one's beliefs, cannot influence such processes.

Fodor arrives at the conclusion that such processes are inferential like higher order processes and encapsulated in the same sense as reflexes.

Although he argued for the modularity of "lower level" cognitive processes in ''Modularity of Mind'' he also argued that higher level cognitive processes are not modular since they have dissimilar properties. ''The Mind Doesn't Work That Way'', a reaction to [[Steven Pinker]]'s ''[[How the Mind Works]]'', is devoted to this subject.

Fodor (1983) states that modular systems must—at least to "some interesting extent"—fulfill certain properties:
# Domain specificity: modules only operate on certain kinds of inputs—they are specialised
# Informational encapsulation: modules need not refer to other psychological systems in order to operate
# Obligatory firing: modules process in a mandatory manner
# Fast speed: probably due to the fact that they are encapsulated (thereby needing only to consult a restricted database) and mandatory (time need not be wasted in determining whether or not to process incoming input)
# Shallow outputs: the output of modules is very simple
# Limited accessibility
# Characteristic [[ontogeny]]: there is a regularity of development
# Fixed neural architecture.

Pylyshyn (1999) has argued that while these properties tend to occur with modules, one—information encapsulation—stands out as being the real signature of a module; that is the encapsulation of the processes inside the module from both cognitive influence and from cognitive access.&lt;ref&gt;Pylyshyn, Z.W. (1999). Is vision continuous with cognition? The case for cognitive impenetrability of visual perception. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 22(3), 341-423. [http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/ftp/pub/papers/bbs1999_reprint.pdf Full text] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511184911/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/ftp/pub/papers/bbs1999_reprint.pdf |date=2008-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is that conscious awareness of the [[Müller-Lyer illusion]] being an illusion does not correct visual processing.&lt;ref name=FP2007/&gt;

==Evolutionary psychology and massive modularity==
Other perspectives on modularity come from [[evolutionary psychology]], particularly from the work of [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]]. This perspective suggests that modules are units of mental processing that evolved in response to selection pressures. On this view, much modern human psychological activity is rooted in adaptations that occurred earlier in [[human evolution]], when [[natural selection]] was forming the modern human species.

Evolutionary psychologists propose that the mind is made up of genetically influenced and domain-specific&lt;ref&gt;Cosmides, L. &amp; Tooby, J. (1994). Origins of Domain Specificity: The Evolution of Functional Organization. In L.A. Hirschfeld and S.A. Gelmen, eds., Mapping the Mind: Domain Specificity in Cognition and Culture. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Reprinted in R. Cummins and D.D. Cummins, eds., Minds, Brains, and Computers. Oxford: Blackwell, 2000, 523-543.&lt;/ref&gt; mental algorithms or computational modules, designed to solve specific evolutionary problems of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Cosmides, L., &amp; Tooby, J. (1992). Cognitive Adaptations for Social Exchange. In Barkow, Cosmides, and Tooby 1992, 163-228.&lt;/ref&gt; Cosmides and Tooby also state in a brief "primer" on their website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html |title=Evolutionary Psychology Primer by Leda Cosmides and John Tooby |publisher=Psych.ucsb.edu |date=1997-01-13 |accessdate=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "…the brain is a physical system. It functions like a computer," "…the brain’s function is to process information," "different neural circuits are specialized for solving different adaptive problems," and "our modern skulls house a stone age mind."

The definition of ''module'' has caused confusion and dispute. J. A. Fodor initially  defined module as "functionally specialized cognitive systems" that have nine features but not necessarily all at the same time. In his views modules can be found in peripheral  processing such as low-level visual processing but not in central processing. Later he  narrowed the two essential features to ''domain-specificity'' and ''information  encapsulation''. Frankenhuis and Ploeger&lt;ref name=FP2007/&gt; write that domain-specificity means that "a given cognitive mechanism accepts, or is specialized to operate on, only a specific class of information". Information encapsulation  means that information processing in the module cannot be affected by information in the  rest of the brain. One example is that being aware that a certain optical illusion, caused by low  level processing, is false does not prevent the illusion from persisting.&lt;ref name=FP2007&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Frankenhuis | first1 = W. E. | last2 = Ploeger | first2 = A. | doi = 10.1080/09515080701665904 | title = Evolutionary Psychology Versus Fodor: Arguments for and Against the Massive Modularity Hypothesis | journal = Philosophical Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 687 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists instead usually define modules as functionally specialized  cognitive systems that are domain-specific and may also contain innate knowledge about the  class of information processed. Modules can be found also for central processing. This  theory is sometimes referred to as ''massive modularity.''&lt;ref name=FP2007/&gt;

A 2010 review by evolutionary psychologists Confer et al. suggested that domain general theories, such as for "rationality," has several problems: 1. Evolutionary  theories using the idea of numerous  domain-specific adaptions have produced testable predictions that have been empirically  confirmed; the theory of domain-general rational thought has produced no such predictions  or confirmations. 2. The rapidity of responses such as jealousy due to infidelity indicates  a domain-specific dedicated module rather than a general, deliberate, rational calculation  of consequences. 3. Reactions may occur instinctively (consistent with innate knowledge)  even if a person has not learned such knowledge. One example being that in the ancestral  environment it is unlikely that males during development learn that infidelity (usually  secret) may cause paternal uncertainty (from observing the phenotypes of children born many  months later and making a statistical conclusion from the phenotype dissimilarity to the cuckolded fathers).&lt;ref name=AmPs2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Confer | first1 = J.

Clune et al. (2013) have argued that computer simulations of the evolution of neural nets suggest that modularity evolves because, compared to non-modular networks, connection costs are lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Clune |first1= Jeff |last2= Mouret |first2= Jean-Baptiste |last3= Lipson |first3= Hod |year= 2013 |title= The evolutionary origins of modularity |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume= 280 |issue= 1755 |pages= |publisher= |doi= 10.1098/rspb.2012.2863 |arxiv= 1207.2743|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several groups of critics, including psychologists working within evolutionary frameworks,&lt;ref name="Panksepp, J. 2000"&gt;Panksepp, J. &amp; Panksepp, J. (2000). [http://www.flyfishingdevon.co.uk/salmon/year3/psy364criticisms-evolutionary-psychology/panksepp_seven_sins.pdf The Seven Sins of Evolutionary Psychology. Evolution and Cognition], 6:2, 108-131.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the massively modular theory of mind does little to explain adaptive psychological traits. Proponents of other models of the mind argue that the [[computational theory of mind]] is no better at explaining human behavior than a theory with mind entirely a product of the environment. Even within evolutionary psychology there is discussion about the degree of modularity, either as a few generalist modules or as many highly specific modules.&lt;ref name="Panksepp, J. 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buller, David J. and Valerie Gray Hardcastle (2005) Chapter 4. "Modularity", in Buller, David J. The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology. The MIT Press. pp. 127 - 201&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics suggest that there is little empirical support in favor of the domain-specific theory beyond performance on the [[Wason selection task]], a task critics state is too limited in scope to test all relevant aspects of reasoning.&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Davies |first1= Paul Sheldon |last2= Fetzer |first2= James H. |last3= Foster |first3= Thomas R. |year= 1995 |title= Logical reasoning and domain specificity |journal= [[Biology and Philosophy]] |volume= 10 |issue= 1 |pages= 1&amp;ndash;37 |publisher= |doi= 10.1007/BF00851985 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= O'Brien |first1= David |authorlink1= |last2= Manfrinati |first2= Angela |authorlink2= |editor1-first= Mike |editor1-last= Oaksford |editor1-link= |editor2-last= Chater |editor2-first= Nick |title= Cognition and Conditionals: Probability and Logic in Human Thinking |url= |year= 2010 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-19-923329-8 |page= |pages= 39&amp;ndash;54 |chapter= The Mental Logic Theory of Conditional Propositions |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=iQSDOqAvXIoC&amp;pg=PA47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, critics argue that Cosmides and Tooby's conclusions contain several inferential errors and that the authors use untested evolutionary assumptions to eliminate rival reasoning theories.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lloyd |first1= Elizabeth A. |last2= |first2= |year= 1999 |title= Evolutionary Psychology: The Burdens of Proof |journal= Biology and Philosophy |volume= 19 |issue= 2 |pages= 211–233 |publisher= |doi= 10.1023/A:1006638501739 |url= http://philpapers.org/archive/LLOEPT.pdf |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace (2010) observes that the evolutionary psychologists' definition of "mind" has been heavily influenced by [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] and/or [[information processing]] definitions of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, B. (2010). Getting Darwin Wrong: Why Evolutionary Psychology Won’t Work. Exeter, UK: Imprint Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics point out that these assumptions underlying evolutionary psychologists' hypotheses are controversial and have been contested by some psychologists, philosophers, and neuroscientists. For example, [[Jaak Panksepp]], an affective neuroscientist, point to the "remarkable degree of neocortical plasticity within the human brain, especially during development" and states that "the developmental interactions among ancient special-purpose circuits and more recent general-purpose brain mechanisms can generate many of the "modularized" human abilities that evolutionary psychology has entertained."&lt;ref name="Panksepp, J. 2000"/&gt;

Philosopher David Buller agrees with the general argument that the human mind has evolved over time but disagrees with the specific claims evolutionary psychologists make. He has argued that the contention that the mind consists of thousands of modules, including sexually dimorphic jealousy and parental investment modules, are unsupported by the available [[empirical evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Buller |first1= David J. |last2= |first2= |year= 2005 |title= Evolutionary psychology: the emperor's new paradigm |journal= Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume= 9 |issue= 6 |pages= 277–283 |publisher= |doi= 10.1016/j.tics.2005.04.003|url= http://commons.lib.niu.edu/bitstream/10843/13182/1/BullerTiCS%20Reprint.pdf |accessdate=March 23, 2013 |pmid=15925806}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has suggested that the "modules" result from the brain's developmental [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] and that they are adaptive responses to local conditions, not past evolutionary environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Buller |first1= David J. |last2= Hardcastle |first2= Valerie |year= 2000 |title= Evolutionary Psychology, Meet Developmental Neurobiology: Against Promiscuous Modularity |journal= Brain and Mind |volume= 1 |issue= 3 |pages= 307&amp;ndash;325 |publisher= |doi= 10.1023/A:1011573226794 |url= http://commons.lib.niu.edu/bitstream/10843/13181/1/evolutionarypsych.pdf |accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Buller has also stated that even if massive modularity is false this does not necessarily have broad implications for evolutionary psychology. Evolution may create innate motives even without innate knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Buller |first1= David J. |last2=  |first2=  |year= 2005 |title= Get Over: Massive Modularity |journal= Biology &amp; Philosophy |volume= 20 |issue= 4 |pages= 881–891 |publisher=  |doi= 10.1007/s10539-004-1602-3 |url= http://www.niu.edu/phil/~buller/publications/_pdf/over.pdf |accessdate= March 23, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150317231528/http://www.niu.edu/phil/~buller/publications/_pdf/over.pdf |archive-date= March 17, 2015 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to modular mental structure, some theories posit [[Domain-general learning|domain-general processing]], in which mental activity is distributed across the brain and cannot be decomposed, even abstractly, into independent units. A staunch defender of this view is William Uttal, who argues in ''The New Phrenology'' (2003) that there are serious philosophical, theoretical, and methodological problems with the entire enterprise of trying to localise cognitive processes in the [[brain]].&lt;ref&gt;Uttal, William R. (2003). ''The New Phrenology: The Limits of Localizing Cognitive Processes in the Brain.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this argument is that a successful [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of mental processes has yet to be developed.

Merlin Donald argues that over evolutionary time the mind has gained adaptive advantage from being a general problem solver.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, ''A Mind So Rare: The Evolution of Human Consciousness'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20060620060057/http://psyc.queensu.ca/faculty/donald/book/mindsorare2.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; The mind, as described by Donald, includes module-like "central" mechanisms, in addition to more recently evolved "domain-general" mechanisms.

'''Multiple religious belonging''' refers to the idea that individuals can belong to more than one religious tradition. While this is often seen as a common reality in regions such as [[Asia]] with its many religions, religious scholars have begun to discuss multiple religion belonging with respect to religious traditions such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]].{{sfnm |1a1=Cornille |1y=2002 |2a1=Phan |2y=2003}}

==Context==
In some religions such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], those who hold to an [[exclusivism|exclusivist]] understanding of religion see multiple religious belonging as problematic. This is in contrast with countries such as [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Sri Lanka]], whose cultures have a long history of being influenced by different religions.{{sfn|Phan|2003|p=498}} Moreover, in the [[Postmodernity|postmodern]] period people tend to question their identity, because of the unlimited choices of religions, which leads to the difficulty in defining their identity.{{sfn|Aylesworth|2015}}

Van Bragt showed that 79% of Japanese self-identify as [[Shintoist]]s and 75% self-identify as [[Buddhism|Buddhists]]. The reason for the extremely high percentage of both religions is that many Japanese consider themselves as both a Shintoist and a Buddhist and do not consider it a problem to belong to more than one religion.{{sfn|Van Bragt|2002|p=8}} (Whether this statistic is correct is arguable.{{efn|According to Mark R. Mullins's figures, there are only 30–33% of Japanese consider themselves as having "personal faith", while others usually see themselves as "without religion" (''mushukyo'').{{sfn|Mullins|2011}} For further discussions, see {{harvnb|Mullins|2011|pp=197–198}}.}}) This phenomenon, according to Van Bragt, is a "[[division of labour]]". Van Bragt argued that the cause of this phenomenon is that, different from the Western concept of religion, Shintoism and Buddhism in Japan are defined by their rituals and practices, not by their moral and social authority.{{efn|According to Van Bragt, while Buddhism and Shintoism govern the rituals and practices of Japanese, Confucianism is regarded as the authority for morality and the source of principles of social life.{{sfn|Van Bragt|2002|p=9}}}} Thus, the Japanese can belong to several religions that do not conflict with each other in terms of social and ethical issues.

Scholars such as [[Catherine Cornille]], [[Peter C. Phan]], [[Francis Xavier Clooney]], [[Jan Van Bragt]], [[Aloysius Pieris]] and [[Devaka Premawardhana]] have questioned the possibility of defining oneself into multiple religions. For these scholars, "religious belonging" is not an individual's subjective sense of a particular religion but rather, in Cornille's words, "the recognition of one's religious identity by the tradition itself and the disposition to submit to the conditions for membership as delineated by that tradition."{{sfn|Cornille|2002|p=4}} For Cornille, the ultimate purpose of a scholarly discussion on multiple religious belonging is to transform one's religion through the understanding of other religions.{{sfn|Cornille|2002|p=5}}

== Types of approaches ==
Based on Van Bragt's study, scholars have tried to investigate the possibility for adherents of a religion such as Christianity to belong to multiple religions. The approach to Christian multiple religious belonging, according to Devaka Premawardhana, can be divided into two trends: [[Peter C. Phan|Peter Phan]]'s approach based on a Christological ground, in which he emphasises on Christ's "asymmetrically superior status", and [[Francis Xavier Clooney|Francis Clooney]]'s approach rooted in a methodological ground, which tries to cross boundaries into another religion just as religions must have discrete entities.{{sfn|Premawardhana|2011|p=77}}{{Elucidate|date=December 2017|reason=What does 'just as religions must have discrete entities' mean? Please clarify this sentence.}} These two approaches are summarised below.

=== Christological approach ===
Phan's approach emphasised the assymmetricality in which [[Jesus]] is the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] made flesh and the climax of God dealing with humankind.{{sfn|Phan|2003|p=503}} In an attempt to resonate with one's cultural identity and tradition, Phan explained that multiple religious belonging is necessary in order for practitioners of multiple belonging to treat other religions as a qualifier of their identity. This approach, according to Phan, does not deny one's Christian identity, which functions as substantive in relation to non-Christian religion.{{sfn|Phan|2003|pp=509–510}} Phan noted that multiple religious belonging is not a new issue in the twenty-first century but rather the common form of life of the first-century Christians recorded in the book of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]]. In Phan's view, the disappearance of this trend was "a tragic loss to both [[Judaism]] and Christianity", because it led to a subsequent history of bitter hatred, especially from the side of Christianity.{{sfn|Phan|2003|pp=504–505}}

=== Methodological approach ===
As a [[Comparative theology|comparative theologian]], Clooney writes about the diversity in the world nowadays, especially with respect to the flourishing of different religions. For Clooney, reflecting on one's religion in this [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralistic]] world is necessary, so that we can "see the others in light of our own, and our own in light of the other."{{sfn|Clooney|2010|p=13}} Focusing on the study of scriptural and theological texts, Clooney compares them between Christian traditions and non-Christian religions, to "cross boundaries" to other traditions, so that one would re-think his or her theology, which would thus shape his or her identity.{{sfn|Clooney|2004}} After more than 40 years of studying Hinduism, Clooney concluded that he finds the distinctive disciplines of theology and Hinduism are "mutually enriching".{{sfn|Clooney|2010|pp=16–17}} By applying this approach, according to Clooney, one can start within his or her "home" tradition, enter a different tradition and return to his or her tradition, which is enriched and reformulated after crossing boundaries.{{sfn|Premawardhana|2011|pp=87–88}}

== Challenges and controversy ==
While scholars studying multiple religious belonging attempt to appreciate other religions' traditions besides their own, the conservative segment of Christianity tends to question the [[Inclusivism|inclusivistic]] view of multiple religious belonging because it implies that salvation can be found from somewhere else other than Jesus Christ.{{sfn|Kärkkäinen|2010}}{{efn|For definitions of traditional typology such as exclusivism and inclusivism, see {{harvnb|Migliore|2004|pp=306–307}}.}} In a 2010 article, [[Veli-Matti Kärkkäinen]], a systematic theologian, questioned the approach of "othering" those that have traditions different from Christians' because God is the one who offers salvation; Christians only witness it. It is out of humility that Christians can say that salvation belongs to God, and God only, in Kärkkäinen's view.{{sfn|Kärkkäinen|2010}} On the other hand, scholars studying multiple religious belonging such as [[John B. Cobb]] see this as an opportunity rather than a threat: "I do not see multiple religious belonging as the primary way into the future. The primary way is the transformation of the particular religious traditions, at least in the Christian case, through their new encounter with other traditions." For Cobb, engaging in [[interfaith dialogue]] helps smooth the tension between Christianity and Judaism and avoid misunderstanding toward [[Islam]].{{sfn|Cobb|2002|p=27}}

In a 2017 article, sociologist Steve Bruce pointed out that most of the published writings in which multiple religious belonging is studied are purely conceptual and offer "only anecdotes to illustrate theoretical or classificatory discussions".{{sfn|Bruce|2017|p=606}} Bruce argued that the few attempts to gather empirical data on the phenomenon have conflated a variety of different attitudes that should not be given the label of "multiple religious belonging", attitudes such as: [[Universalism|universalistic]] re-interpretation of multiple religions, multiple religious association through family ties, multiple religious interest or sympathies, ancillary religious respect for a specific aspect of a religion, and secular equal respect for all religions.{{sfn|Bruce|2017|p=610–611}} Bruce argued that the term "multiple religious belonging" should be strictly confined to being "an observant 'member' of more than one religion (religion here meaning such high level abstractions as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism etc)", and since most religions have strict requirements for and expectations of observant members, sociologists should expect multiple religious belonging, defined in this way, to be "remarkably rare".{{sfn|Bruce|2017|p=611}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10241">'''Musical expression''' is the art of playing or singing with a personal response to the music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scruton|first1=Roger|title=Expression|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/09138|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=8 July 2017|ref=GroveExpression}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a practical level, this means making appropriate use of [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], [[timbre]] and [[Articulation (music)|articulation]] to bring the music to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scruton|first1=Roger|title=Expression|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/09138|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=8 July 2017|ref=GroveExpression}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Composers may specify these aspects of expression to a greater or lesser extent in the [[musical notation|notation]] of their [[Full score|musical score]].

The nature of musical expression has also been discussed at a theoretical level throughout of the history of [[classical music]]. One common view is that music both expresses and evokes emotion, forming a conduit for emotional communication between the musician and the audience. This view has been present through most of musical history, though it was most clearly expressed in musical [[romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scruton|first1=Roger|title=Expression|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/09138|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=8 July 2017|ref=GroveExpression}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, emotion's role in music has been challenged on occasion by those like [[Igor Stravinsky]] who see music as a pure art form and expression as an irrelevant distraction.

==Mimesis and rhetoric==
In the [[Baroque (music)|Baroque]] and [[Classical (music)|Classical]] periods of music, music (and [[aesthetics]] as a whole) was strongly influenced by Aristotle's theory of ''[[Mimesis#Aristotle|mimesis]]''. Art represented the perfection and imitation of nature, speech and emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kovaleff Baker|first1=Nancy|title=Expression - History before 1800 |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/09138#S09138.1.1|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=8 July 2017|ref=GroveExpressionbefore1800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As speech was taken as a model for music, composition and performance in the Baroque period were strongly influenced by [[rhetoric]]. According to what has become known as the [[Doctrine of the affections|theory of affect]], a musician was expected to stir feelings in his audience in much the same way as an orator making a speech in accordance with the rules of classical rhetoric. As a result, the aim of a piece of music was to produce a particular emotion, for instance joy, sadness, anger or calm. The harmony, melody, tonality, metre and structure of the music worked to this end, as did all the aspects under the performer's control such as articulation and dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buelow|first1=George|title=Rhetoric|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43166#S43166.1.4|website=Grove Music Online (subscriber only access)|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=8 July 2017|ref=GroveRhetoric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Johann Joachim Quantz]] wrote,
{{Quote|text=The orator and the musician have, at bottom, the same aim in regard to both the preparation and the final execution of their productions, namely to make themselves the masters of the hearts of their listeners, to arouse or still their passions, and to transport them now to this sentiment, now that.|author=Joseph Joachim Quantz|source=On Playing the Flute (trans E.R. Reilly), London &amp; New York, 1966 }}

Baroque composers used expressive markings relatively rarely,  so it can be a challenge for musicians today to interpret Baroque scores, in particular if they adopt a [[historically informed performance]] perspective and aim to recreate an approach that might have been recognised at the time. There are no universal rules in doing so, but there are some broad principles. Looking at the [[rhythm]] of a piece, slow rhythms tend to be serious while quick ones tend towards light and frivolous. In the melodic line, small intervals typically represented melancholy while large leaps were used to represent joy.&lt;ref name="Tarling4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tarling|first1=Judy|title=Baroque String Playing for Ingenious Learners|date=2000|publisher=Corda Music|location=Tring|isbn=978-0-9528220-1-1|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In harmony, the choice of [[Dissonance (music)|dissonance]]s used had a significant effect on which emotion was intended (or produced), and Quantz recommended that the more extreme the dissonance, the louder it should be played. A [[Cadence (music)|cadence]] normally represented the end of a sentence.&lt;ref name="Tarling203"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tarling|first1=Judy|title=Baroque String Playing for Ingenious Learners|date=2000|publisher=Corda Music|location=Tring|isbn=978-0-9528220-1-1|pages=203–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhetorical approach to music begged the philosophical question of whether stirring the listener's passions in this manner was compatible with Aristotle's idea that art was only effective because it imitated nature. Some writers on music in the 18th century stayed closely true to Aristotle, with [[Charles Batteux]] writing that the sole unifying principle of taste and beauty was the reproduction of the ideal form that lay behind natural things. However, this view was challenged by others who felt that the role of music was to produce an emotional effect. For instance, [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]] wrote in 1772 that: "‘it will appear, that the finest parts of poetry, musick, and painting, are expressive of the passions, and operate on our minds by sympathy; that the inferior parts of them are descriptive of natural objects, and affect us chiefly by substitution’".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kovaleff Baker|first1=Nancy|title=Expression - History before 1800 |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/09138#S09138.1.1|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=8 July 2017|ref=GroveExpressionbefore1800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1785, [[Michel Paul Guy de Chabanon|Michel de Chabanon]] proposed that music was best understood as its own language, which then prompted an emotional response linked to but not limited by the musical expression. The same music could be associated with a wide range of emotional responses in the listener. Chabanon rejected the rhetorical approach to music, because he did not believe that there was a simple correspondence between musical characteristics and emotional affects. Much subsequent philosophy of music depended on Chabanon's views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kovaleff Baker|first1=Nancy|title=Expression - History before 1800 |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/09138#S09138.1.1|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=8 July 2017|ref=GroveExpressionbefore1800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romantic era==
Around the start of the 19th Century, the idea of music as a kind of 'ultimate language of the emotions'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paddison|first1=Max|title=Expression: History -  After 1800|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/09138#S09138.1.2|website=Grove Music Online (subscriber only access)|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=8 July 2017|ref=GroveExpressionAfter1800}}&lt;/ref&gt; gained currency.  The new aesthetic doctrine of [[Romanticism]] placed sublime, heightened emotion at the core of artistic experience, and communicating these emotions became the aim of musical performance. Music was expected to convey intense feelings, highly personal to the vision of the composer. As the 19th century developed, [[musical nationalism]] extended these emotions beyond the personal level to embodying the feelings of entire nations.&lt;ref name="ABRSMRomantic4"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hugh Macdonald|authorlink1=Historical Background|editor1-last=Burton|editor1-first=Anthony|title=Performer's Guide to Music of the Romantic Period|date=2002|publisher=ABRSM|location=London|isbn=978 1 86096 194 6|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This emphasis on emotional communication was supported by an increasing confidence in using more complex [[harmony]], and by instruments and ensembles capable of greater extremes of [[dynamics (music)|dynamic]]. At the start of the 19th century, {{serif|pp}} and {{serif|ff}} were the most extreme dynamic markings commonly used, but by the late century {{serif|pppp}} and {{serif|ffff}}. Romantic composers also made increasingly detailed use of expressive markings like crescendos and diminuendos, accents and articulation markings.&lt;ref name="ABRSMRomantic16"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hugh Macdonald|authorlink1=Historical Background|editor1-last=Burton|editor1-first=Anthony|title=Performer's Guide to Music of the Romantic Period|date=2002|publisher=ABRSM|location=London|isbn=978 1 86096 194 6|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Against expression==
After the increasing dominance of expression and emotion in music during the 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a backlash.

"Most people like music because it gives them certain emotions such as joy, grief, sadness, and image of nature, a subject for daydreams or – still better – oblivion from “everyday life”. They want a drug – dope -…. Music would not be worth much if it were reduced to such an end. When people have learned to love music for itself, when they listen with other ears, their enjoyment will be of a far higher and more potent order, and they will be able to judge it on a higher plane and realise its intrinsic value." - Igor Stravinsky &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stravinsky on expression in music |url=https://theoryofmusic.wordpress.com/2008/10/10/stravinsky-on-expression-in-music/|website=Theory of Music|accessdate=8 7 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Museum of Music''' is in [[Ouagadougou]], ([[Burkina Faso]]) in a two-story building on Oubritenga Avenue on the south side of the Phillipe Zinda Kabore School.  

The building that once housed the [[Association for the Development of African Architecture and Urban Planning]] (ADAUA) was renovated to accommodate the [[museum]]. The building is in Sudanese Sahelian style with dome-shaped roofs. It is in the centre of the city and is easily accessible to the general public.

The first collection, put together between September 1998 and March 1999, is constantly growing. Instruments from all families are represented including [[aerophone]]s, [[membranophone]]s, [[idiophone]]s and [[chordophone]]s. Each object is the only one of its kind and varies from 5 to 200 years in age.

The museum is headed by the curator, [[Parfait Z. Bambara]]

'''Orientalism''' is a term used by art historians and literary and [[cultural studies]] scholars for the imitation or depiction of aspects in [[Eastern world|West Asian, South Asian, Southeast Asian and East Asian cultures]]. These depictions are usually done by writers, designers, and artists from the West. In particular, '''Orientalist painting''', depicting more specifically "the [[Middle East]]",&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 6&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the many specialisms of 19th-century [[academic art]], and the literature of Western countries took a similar interest in Oriental themes.

Since the publication of [[Edward Said]]'s ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' in 1978, much academic discourse has begun to use the term "Orientalism" to refer to a general patronizing Western attitude towards Middle Eastern, Asian, and North African societies. In Said's analysis, the West [[Essentialism|essentializes]] these societies as static and undeveloped—thereby fabricating a view of Oriental culture that can be studied, depicted, and reproduced. Implicit in this fabrication, writes Said, is the idea that Western society is developed, rational, flexible, and superior.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood Mamdani, ''Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terrorism'', New York: Pantheon, 2004; {{ISBN|0-375-42285-4}}; p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
Orientalism refers to the [[Orient]], in reference and opposition to the [[Occident]]; the East and the West, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Latin ''Oriens'', ''Oxford English Dictionary''. p. 000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. "Orientalism," New York: Vintage Books, 1979. p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; The word Orient entered the English language as the [[Middle French]] ''orient''. The root word ''oriēns'', from the Latin ''Oriēns'', has synonymous denotations: The eastern part of the world; the sky whence comes the sun; the east; the rising sun, etc.; yet the denotation changed as a term of geography. In the "[[Monk's Tale]]" (1375), [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] wrote: "That they conquered many regnes grete / In the orient, with many a fair citee." The term "orient" refers to countries east of the Mediterranean Sea and Southern Europe. ''In Place of Fear'' (1952), [[Aneurin Bevan]] used an expanded denotation of the Orient that comprehended [[East Asia]]: "the awakening of the Orient under the impact of Western ideas". Edward Said said that Orientalism "enables the political, economic, cultural and social domination of the West, not just during colonial times, but also in the present."&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. "Orientalism," New York: Vintage Books, 1979: 357&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
In art history, the term Orientalism refers to the works of the Western artists who specialized in Oriental subjects, produced from their travels in [[Western Asia]], during the 19th century. In that time, artists and scholars were described as Orientalists, especially in France, where the dismissive use of the term "Orientalist" was made popular by the art critic [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary]].&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 20&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such social disdain for a style of [[Representation (arts)|representational art]], the [[Société des Peintres Orientalistes Français|French Society of Orientalist Painters]] was founded in 1893, with [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] as the honorary president;&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 74&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Britain, the term Orientalist identified "an artist".&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the French Orientalist Painters Society changed the consciousness of practitioners towards the end of the 19th century, since artists could now see themselves as part of a distinct art movement.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, R., ''Orientalist Aesthetics: Art, Colonialism, and French North Africa, 1880-1930,'' 2003, pp 57 -78&lt;/ref&gt; As an art movement, Orientalist painting is generally treated as one of the many branches of 19th-century [[academic art]]; however, many different styles of Orientalist art were in evidence. Art historians tend to identify two broad types of Orientalist artist: the realists who carefully painted what they observed and those who imagined Orientalist scenes without ever leaving the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Mercedes Volait, "Middle Eastern collections of Orientalist Painting at the Turn of the 21st century: Paradoxical reversal or persistent misunderstanding?; François Pouillon and Jean-Claude Vatin, ''After Orientalism: Critical perspectives on Western Agency and Eastern Reappropriations," ''Leiden Studies in Islam and Society,'' pp 251-271, 2014, Online: &lt;http://www.brill.com/products/book/after-orientalism&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; French painters such as [[Eugène Delacroix]] (1798–1863) and [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1824–1904) are widely regarded as the leading luminaries of the Orientalist movement.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia.com, https://www.encyclopedia.com/literature-and-arts/art-and-architecture/art-general/orientalism&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oriental studies===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the term [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] identified a scholar who specialized in the languages and literatures of the [[Eastern world]]. Among such scholars were British officials of the [[East India Company]], who said that the [[Arab culture]], the [[culture of India]], and the [[Islamic culture]]s should be studied as equal to the cultures of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Macfie |first = A. L.|year = 2002 |title = Orientalism |publisher = Longman| location = London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0FrJAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn = 0582423864|ref = none| p = Ch One}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among such scholars is the philologist [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]], whose studies of [[Indo-European languages]] established modern [[philology]]. British [[Company rule in India|imperial strategy in India]] favored Orientalism as a technique for developing good relations with the natives—until the 1820s, when the influence of "anglicists" such as [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] led to the promotion of Anglocentric education.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway (2006), pp. 1–2. "The Orientalism espoused by Warren Hastings, William Jones and the early East India Company sought to maintain British domination over the Indian subcontinent through patronage of Hindu and Muslim languages and institutions, rather than through their eclipse by English speech and aggressive European acculturation."&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[Hebraists|Hebraism]] and [[Jewish studies]] gained popularity among British and German scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08624.html|title=Hebraists, Christian|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic field of [[Oriental studies]], which comprehended the cultures of the [[Near East]] and the [[Far East]], became the fields of [[Asian studies]] and [[Middle Eastern studies]].

===Critical studies===
In the book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978), the cultural critic Edward Said redefined the term Orientalism to describe a pervasive Western tradition — academic and artistic — of prejudiced outsider-interpretations of the Eastern world, which was shaped by the cultural attitudes of European [[imperialism]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 24&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis of ''Orientalism'' develops [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s theory of [[cultural hegemony]], and [[Michel Foucault]]'s theorisation of [[discourse]] (the [[knowledge]]-and-[[Power (social and political)|power]] relation) to criticise the scholarly tradition of Oriental studies. Said criticised contemporary scholars who perpetuated the tradition of outsider-interpretation of [[Arab]]o-Islamic cultures, especially [[Bernard Lewis]] and [[Fouad Ajami]].&lt;ref&gt;''Orientalism'' (1978) Preface, 2003 ed. p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xypolia|first=Ilia|title=Orientations and Orientalism: The Governor Sir Ronald Storrs|journal=Journal of IslamicJerusalem Studies|year=2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=24–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analyses are of Orientalism in European literature, especially French literature, and do not analyse [[visual art]] and [[Orientalist painting]]. In that vein, the art historian [[Linda Nochlin]] applied Said's methods of critical analysis to art, "with uneven results".&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 6, 11 (quoted), 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[academy]], the book ''Orientalism'' (1978) became a foundational text of [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial cultural studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xypolia|first=Ilia|title=Orientations and Orientalism: The Governor Sir Ronald Storrs|journal=Journal of Islamic Jerusalem Studies|year=2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=25–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in relation to the cultural institution of [[citizenship]], Orientalism has rendered the concept of ''citizenship'' as a problem of [[epistemology]], because citizenship originated as a social institution of the Western world; as such, the problem of defining citizenship reconfigures the idea of ''Europe'' in time of crises.&lt;ref&gt;Mura, Andrea, (2015) "[https://www.academia.edu/21512966/Dis-orienting_Austerity_The_Indebted_Citizen_as_the_New_Soul_of_Europe Disorienting Austerity: The Indebted Citizen as the New Soul of Europe]" In Engin Isin (ed.), ''Citizenship After Orientalism: Transforming Political Theory''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Said said that Orientalism, as an "idea of representation is a theoretical one: The Orient is a stage on which the whole East is confined" in order to make the Eastern world "less fearsome to the West";&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Said, Edward. "Orientalism," New York: Vintage Books, 1979: 363&lt;/ref&gt; that the developing world, primarily the West, is the cause of [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Said|first1=Edward|title=Orientalism|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JncXpQQoZAo|date=April 16, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in ''Empire: A Very Short Introduction'' (2000), Stephen Howe agreed with Said that Western nations and their empires were created by the exploitation of underdeveloped countries, by the extraction of wealth and labour from one country to another country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howe|first1=Stephen|title=Empire:A Very Short Introduction|publisher=Oxford University press|pages=73–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In European architecture and design==
{{Further|Orientalism in early modern France}}
The [[Moresque]] style of [[Renaissance]] [[ornament (art)|ornament]] is a European adaptation of the Islamic [[arabesque]] that began in the late 15th century and was to be used in some types of work, such as [[bookbinding]], until almost the present day. Early architectural use of motifs lifted from the Indian subcontinent is known as [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture]]. One of the earliest examples is the façade of [[Guildhall, London]] (1788–1789). The style gained momentum in the west with the publication of views of India by [[William Hodges]], and [[William Daniell|William]] and [[Thomas Daniell]] from about 1795. Examples of "Hindoo" architecture are [[Sezincote House]] (c. 1805) in [[Gloucestershire]], built for a [[nabob]] returned from [[Bengal]], and the [[Royal Pavilion]] in [[Brighton]].

''[[Turquerie]]'', which began as early as the late 15th century, continued until at least the 18th century, and included both the use of "Turkish" styles in the decorative arts, the adoption of Turkish costume at times, and interest in art depicting the [[Ottoman Empire]] itself. Venice, the traditional trading partner of the Ottomans, was the earliest centre, with France becoming more prominent in the 18th century.

''[[Chinoiserie]]'' is the catch-all term for the fashion for Chinese themes in decoration in Western Europe, beginning in the late 17th century and peaking in waves, especially [[Rococo]] Chinoiserie, ''c.'' 1740–1770. From the [[Renaissance]] to the 18th century, Western designers attempted to imitate the technical sophistication of Chinese ceramics with only partial success. Early hints of Chinoiserie appeared in the 17th century in nations with active East India companies: England (the [[East India Company]]), Denmark (the [[Danish East India Company]]), the Netherlands (the [[Dutch East India Company]]) and France (the [[French East India Company]]). Tin-glazed pottery made at [[Delft]] and other Dutch towns adopted genuine [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]-era [[blue and white porcelain]] from the early 17th century. Early ceramic wares made at [[Meissen]] and other centers of true [[porcelain]] imitated Chinese shapes for dishes, vases and [[teaware]]s (see [[Chinese export porcelain]]).

Pleasure pavilions in "Chinese taste" appeared in the formal parterres of late Baroque and Rococo German palaces, and in tile panels at [[Aranjuez]] near [[Madrid]]. [[Thomas Chippendale]]'s mahogany tea tables and china cabinets, especially, were embellished with fretwork glazing and railings, ''c.'' 1753–70. Sober ''homages'' to early Xing scholars' furnishings were also naturalized, as the ''tang'' evolved into a mid-Georgian side table and squared slat-back armchairs that suited English gentlemen as well as Chinese scholars. Not every adaptation of Chinese design principles falls within mainstream "chinoiserie". Chinoiserie media included imitations of lacquer and painted tin (tôle) ware that imitated japanning, early painted wallpapers in sheets, and ceramic figurines and table ornaments. Small [[pagoda]]s appeared on chimneypieces and full-sized ones in gardens. [[Kew]] has a magnificent garden pagoda designed by [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]]. The [[Wilhelma]] (1846) in [[Stuttgart]] is an example of [[Moorish Revival architecture]]. [[Leighton House Museum|Leighton House]], built for the artist [[Frederic Leighton]], has a conventional facade but elaborate Arab-style interiors, including original Islamic tiles and other elements as well as Victorian Orientalizing work.

After 1860, ''[[Japonism]],'' sparked by the importing of [[ukiyo-e]], became an important influence in the western arts. In particular, many modern French artists such as [[Claude Monet]] and [[Edgar Degas]] were influenced by the Japanese style. [[Mary Cassatt]], an American artist who worked in France, used elements of combined patterns, flat planes and shifting perspective of Japanese prints in her own images.&lt;ref&gt;The subject of Ives&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings of [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]'s ''[[The Peacock Room]]'' demonstrated how he used aspects of Japanese tradition and are some of the finest works of the genre. California architects [[Greene and Greene]] were inspired by Japanese elements in their design of the [[Gamble House (Pasadena, California)|Gamble House]] and other buildings.

[[Egyptian Revival architecture]] became popular in the early and mid-19th century and continued as a minor style into the early 20th century. [[Moorish Revival architecture]] began in the early 19th century in the German states and was particularly popular for building synagogues. [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture]] was a genre that arose in the late 19th century in the [[British Raj]].

==Orientalist art==
===Pre-19th century===
[[File:Gentile Bellini Madonna and Child Enthroned late 15th century.jpg|thumb|A "Bellini type" [[Islamic]] [[prayer rug]], seen from the top, at the feet of the [[Virgin Mary]], in [[Gentile Bellini]]'s ''Madonna and Child Enthroned'', late 15th century]]
Depictions of Islamic "[[Moors]]" and "Turks" (imprecisely named [[Muslim]] groups of [[southern Europe]], [[North Africa]] and [[West Asia]]) can be found in Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque art. In Biblical scenes in [[Early Netherlandish painting]], secondary figures, especially Romans, were given exotic costumes that distantly reflected the clothes of the [[Near East]]. The [[Biblical Magi|Three Magi]] in [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity scenes]] were an especial focus for this. In general art with Biblical settings would not be considered as Orientalist except where contemporary or historicist Middle Eastern detail or settings is a feature of works, as with some paintings by [[Gentile Bellini]] and others, and a number of 19th century works. Renaissance [[Venice]] had a phase of particular interest in depictions of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in painting and [[old master print|prints]]. Gentile Bellini, who travelled to [[Constantinople]] and painted the Sultan, and [[Vittore Carpaccio]] were the leading painters. By then the depictions were more accurate, with men typically dressed all in white. The depiction of [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting]] sometimes draws from Orientalist interest, but more often just reflects the prestige these expensive objects had in the period.&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Étienne Liotard]] (1702–1789) visited [[Istanbul]] and painted numerous [[pastel]]s of Turkish domestic scenes; he also continued to wear Turkish attire for much of the time when he was back in Europe. The ambitious Scottish 18th-century artist [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] found a solution to the problem of using modern dress, considered unheroic and inelegant, in [[history painting]] by using Middle Eastern settings with Europeans wearing local costume, as travelers were advised to do. His huge ''James Dawkins and Robert Wood Discovering the Ruins of [[Palmyra]]'' (1758, now Edinburgh) elevates tourism to the heroic, with the two travelers wearing what look very like [[toga]]s. Many travelers had themselves painted in exotic Eastern dress on their return, including [[Lord Byron]], as did many who had never left Europe, including [[Madame de Pompadour]].&lt;ref&gt;Christine Riding, ''Travellers and Sitters: The Orientalist Portrait'', in Tromans, 48–75&lt;/ref&gt; The growing French interest in exotic Oriental luxury and lack of liberty in the 18th century to some extent reflected a pointed analogy with France's own [[absolute monarchy]].&lt;ref name="McCabe2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ina Baghdiantz McCabe|title=Orientalism in Early Modern France: Eurasian Trade, Exoticism and the Ancien Regime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XnS6lVLapI4C&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=31 August 2013|date=15 July 2008|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84520-374-0|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byron's poetry was highly influential in introducing Europe to the heady cocktail of [[Romanticism]] in exotic Oriental settings which was to dominate 19th century Oriental art.

===French Orientalism===
[[File:Leon Cogniet - L Expedition D Egypte Sous Les Ordres De Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|240px|''The 1798 Egyptian Expedition Under the Command of Bonaparte'', [[Léon Cogniet]], 1835. [[Musée du Louvre]]]]
[[File:Ferdinand-Victor-Eugène Delacroix, French - The Death of Sardanapalus - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|240px|''[[The Death of Sardanapalus]]'', [[Eugène Delacroix]], 1827]]
French Orientalist painting was transformed by [[Napoleon]]'s ultimately unsuccessful [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invasion of Egypt and Syria]] in 1798–1801, which stimulated great public interest in [[Egyptology]], and was also recorded in subsequent years by Napoleon's court painters, especially [[Antoine-Jean Gros]], although the Middle Eastern campaign was not one on which he accompanied the army. Two of his most successful paintings, ''[[Bonaparte Visiting the Plague Victims of Jaffa]]'' (1804) and ''[[Battle of Abukir (1799)|Battle of Abukir]]'' (1806) focus on the Emperor, as he was by then, but include many Egyptian figures, as does the less effective ''Napoleon at the Battle of the Pyramids'' (1810). [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]]'s ''La Révolte du Caire'' (1810) was another large and prominent example. A well-illustrated ''Description de l'Égypte'' was published by the French Government in twenty volumes between 1809 and 1828, concentrating on [[antiquities]].&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugène Delacroix]]'s first great success, ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' (1824) was painted before he visited Greece or the East, and followed his friend [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' in showing a recent incident in distant parts that had aroused public opinion. [[Greece]] was still fighting for independence from the Ottomans, and was effectively as exotic as the more Near Eastern parts of the empire. Delacroix followed up with ''[[Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi]]'' (1827), commemorating a siege of the previous year, and ''[[The Death of Sardanapalus]]'', inspired by [[Lord Byron]], which although set in antiquity has been credited with beginning the mixture of sex, violence, lassitude and exoticism which runs through much French Orientalist painting.&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, 294–296; Tromans, 128&lt;/ref&gt; In 1832, Delacroix finally visited what is now [[Algeria]], recently conquered by the French, and [[Morocco]], as part of a diplomatic mission to the [[Sultan of Morocco]]. He was greatly struck by what he saw, comparing the North African way of life to that of the Ancient Romans, and continued to paint subjects from his trip on his return to France. Like many later Orientalist painters, he was frustrated by the difficulty of sketching women, and many of his scenes featured [[Jews]] or warriors on horses. However, he was apparently able to get into the women's' quarters or [[harem]] of a house to sketch what became ''[[Women of Algiers]]''; few later harem scenes had this claim to authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 81&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Le Bain Turc, by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|240px|Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, ''[[The Turkish Bath]]'', 1862]]
When Ingres, the director of the French ''Académie de peinture'', painted a highly colored vision of a ''[[Turkish bath]]'', he made his eroticized Orient publicly acceptable by his diffuse generalizing of the female forms (who might all have been the same model). More open sensuality was seen as acceptable in the exotic Orient.&lt;ref name="Tromans, 135"&gt;Tromans, 135&lt;/ref&gt; This imagery persisted in art into the early 20th century, as evidenced in [[Henri Matisse]]'s orientalist semi-nudes from his Nice period, and his use of Oriental costumes and patterns. Ingres' pupil [[Théodore Chassériau]] (1819–1856) had already achieved success with his nude ''[[The Toilette of Esther]]'' (1841, [[Louvre]]) and equestrian portrait of ''Ali-Ben-Hamet, Caliph of Constantine and Chief of the Haractas, Followed by his Escort'' (1846) before he first visited the East, but in later decades the [[steamship]] made travel much easier and increasing numbers of artists traveled to the Middle East and beyond, painting a wide range of Oriental scenes.

In many of these works, they portrayed the Orient as exotic, colorful and sensual, not to say [[stereotype]]d. Such works typically concentrated on Arab, Jewish, and other Semitic cultures, as those were the ones visited by artists as France became more engaged in North Africa. French artists such as [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] painted many works depicting Islamic culture, often including lounging [[odalisque]]s. They stressed both lassitude and visual spectacle. Other scenes, especially in [[genre painting]], have been seen as either closely comparable to their equivalents set in modern-day or historical Europe, or as also reflecting an Orientalist mind-set in the Saidian sense of the term. Gérôme was the precursor, and often the master, of a number of French painters in the later part of the century whose works were often frankly salacious, frequently featuring scenes in harems, public baths and slave auctions (the last two also available with classical decor), and responsible, with others, for "the equation of Orientalism with the nude in pornographic mode";&lt;ref&gt;Tromans. 136&lt;/ref&gt; (''Gallery, below'')

===British Orientalism===
[[File:William Holman Hunt 002.jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[William Holman Hunt]], ''A Street Scene in Cairo; The Lantern-Maker's Courtship'', 1854–61]]
Though British political interest in the territories of the unravelling Ottoman Empire was as intense as in France, it was mostly more discreetly exercised. The origins of British Orientalist 19th-century painting owe more to religion than military conquest or the search for plausible locations for naked women. The leading British [[genre painter]], [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]] was 55 when he travelled to [[Istanbul]] and [[Jerusalem]] in 1840, dying off [[Gibraltar]] during the return voyage. Though not noted as a religious painter, Wilkie made the trip with a [[Protestant]] agenda to reform religious painting, as he believed that: "a [[Martin Luther]] in painting is as much called for as in theology, to sweep away the abuses by which our divine pursuit is encumbered", by which he meant traditional Christian [[iconography]]. He hoped to find more authentic settings and decor for Biblical subjects at their original location, though his death prevented more than studies being made. Other artists including the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] had similar motivations,&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 14 (quoted), 162–165&lt;/ref&gt; giving an emphasis on realism in British Orientalist art from the start.&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, 289, disputing Rosenthal assertion, and insisting that "there must be some attempt to clarify ''whose'' reality we are talking about".&lt;/ref&gt; The French artist [[James Tissot]] also used contemporary Middle Eastern landscape and decor for Biblical subjects, with little regard for historical costumes or other fittings.

William Holman Hunt produced a number of major paintings of Biblical subjects drawing on his Middle Eastern travels, improvising variants of contemporary Arab costume and furnishings to avoid specifically Islamic styles, and also some landscapes and genre subjects. The biblical subjects included ''[[The Scapegoat (painting)|The Scapegoat]]'' (1856), ''[[The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple]]'' (1860), and ''[[The Shadow of Death]]'' (1871). ''[[The Miracle of the Holy Fire (painting)|The Miracle of the Holy Fire]]'' (1899) was intended as a picturesque satire on the local Eastern Christians, of whom, like most English visitors, Hunt took a very dim view. His ''A Street Scene in Cairo; The Lantern-Maker's Courtship'' (1854–61) is a rare contemporary narrative scene, as the young man feels his fiancé's face, which he is not allowed to see, through her veil, as a Westerner in the background beats his way up the street with his stick.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 16–17 and see index&lt;/ref&gt; This a rare intrusion of a clearly contemporary figure into an Orientalist scene; mostly they claim the picturesqueness of the historical painting so popular at the time, without the trouble of researching authentic costumes and settings.

When Gérôme exhibited ''For Sale; Slaves at Cairo'' at the [[Royal Academy]] in London in 1871, it was "widely found offensive", perhaps partly because the British liked to think they had successfully suppressed the [[slave trade]] in Egypt, also for cruelty and "representing fleshiness for its own sake".&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; But Rana Kabbani believes that "French Orientalist painting, as exemplified by the works of Gérôme, may appear more sensual, gaudy, gory and sexually explicit than its British counterpart, but this is a difference of style not substance ... Similar strains of fascination and repulsion convulsed their artists"&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 43&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, nudity and violence are more evident in British paintings set in the ancient world, and "the iconography of the ''[[odalisque]]'' ... the Oriental [[sex slave]] whose image is offered up to the viewer as freely as she herself supposedly was to her master – is almost entirely French in origin",&lt;ref name="Tromans, 135"/&gt; though taken up with enthusiasm by Italian and other painters.

[[John Frederick Lewis]], who lived for several years in a traditional mansion in [[Cairo]], painted highly detailed works showing both realistic [[Genre painting|genre scenes]] of Middle Eastern life and more idealized scenes in upper class Egyptian interiors with no traces of Western cultural influence yet apparent. His careful and seemingly affectionate representation of Islamic architecture, furnishings, screens, and costumes set new standards of realism, which influenced other artists, including Gérôme in his later works. He "never painted a nude", and his wife modelled for several of his harem scenes,&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, quote 135; 134 on his wife; generally: 22–32, 80–85, 130–135, and see index&lt;/ref&gt; which, with the rare examples by the classicist painter [[Lord Leighton]], imagine "the harem as a place of almost English domesticity, ... [where]... women's fully clothed respectability suggests a moral healthiness to go with their natural good looks".&lt;ref name="Tromans, 135"/&gt;

Other artists concentrated on [[landscape painting]], often of desert scenes, including [[Richard Dadd]] and [[Edward Lear]]. [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] (1796–1864) produced architectural and landscape views, many of [[antiquities]], and published very successful books of [[lithograph]]s from them.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 102–125, covers landscape&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian Orientalist art was largely concerned with the areas of [[Central Asia]] that Russia was conquering during the century, and also in historical painting with the [[Mongol]]s who had dominated Russia for much of the Middle Ages, who were rarely shown in a good light. [[Nationalist]] historical painting in [[Central Europe]] and the [[Balkans]] dwelt on Turkish oppression, with [[battle scene]]s and maidens about to be raped.

The Saidian analysis has not prevented a strong revival of interest in, and collecting of, 19th century Orientalist works since the 1970s, the latter was in large part led by Middle Eastern buyers.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 7, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors and composers are not commonly referred to as "Orientalist" in the way that artists are, and relatively few specialized in Oriental topics or styles, or are even best known for their works including them. But many major figures, from Mozart to Flaubert, have produced significant works with Oriental subjects or treatments. [[Lord Byron]] with his four long "Turkish tales" in poetry, is one of the most important writers to make exotic fantasy Oriental settings a significant theme in the literature of [[Romanticism]]. Verdi's opera ''Aida'' (1871) is set in Egypt as portrayed through the content and the visual spectacle. "Aida" depicts a militaristic Egypt's tyranny over Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Beard and Gloag 2005, 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish Orientalism had a particular character, drawing on various beliefs about early historical links between Ireland and the East, few of which are now regarded as historically correct. The mythical [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]] are one example of this. The Irish were also conscious of the views of other nations seeing them as comparably backward to the East, and Europe's "backyard Orient".&lt;ref&gt;Lennon, Joseph. "Irish Orientalism," New York: Syracuse University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===In music===
In music, Orientalism may be applied to styles occurring in different periods, such as the ''alla Turca'', used by multiple composers including [[Mozart]] and [[Beethoven]].&lt;ref name="Beard and Gloag 2005, 129"&gt;Beard and Gloag 2005, 129&lt;/ref&gt; The American musicologist [[Richard Taruskin]] has identified in 19th-century Russian music a strain of Orientalism: "the East as a sign or metaphor, as imaginary geography, as historical fiction, as the reduced and totalized other against which we construct our (not less reduced and totalized) sense of ourselves".&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Taruskin concedes Russian composers, unlike those in France and Germany, felt an "ambivalence" to the theme since "Russia was a contiguous empire in which Europeans, living side by side with 'orientals', identified (and intermarried) with them far more than in the case of other colonial powers".&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Taruskin characterizes Orientalism in Romantic Russian music as having melodies "full of close little ornaments and melismas",&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; chromatic accompanying lines, drone bass&lt;ref name="taruskin165"&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;—characteristics which were used by [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]], [[Mily Balakirev|Balakirev]], [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Sergei Lyapunov|Lyapunov]], and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninov]]. These musical characteristics evoke "not just the East, but the seductive East that emasculates, enslaves, renders passive. In a word, it signifies the promise of the experience of ''nega'', a prime attribute of the orient as imagined by the Russians. ... In opera and song, ''nega'' often simply denotes S-E-X a la russe, desired or achieved."&lt;ref name="taruskin165" /&gt;

Orientalism is also traceable in music that is considered to have effects of [[exoticism]], including the ''[[japonisme]]'' in [[Claude Debussy]]'s piano music all the way to the [[sitar]] being used in recordings by [[the Beatles]].&lt;ref name="Beard and Gloag 2005, 129"/&gt;

===In literature===
The Romantic movement in literature began in 1785 and ended around 1830. The term "Romantic" references the ideas and culture that writers of the time reflected in their work. During this time, the culture and objects of the East began to have a profound effect on Europe. Extensive traveling by artists and members of the European elite brought travelogues and sensational tales back to the West creating a great interest in all things "foreign". Romantic Orientalism incorporates African and Asian geographic locations, well-known colonial and "native" personalities, folklore, and philosophies to create a literary environment of colonial exploration from a distinctly European worldview. The current trend in analysis of this movement references a belief in this literature as a mode to justify European colonial endeavors with the expansion of territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Romantic Orientalism: Overview|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/romantic/topic_4/welcome.htm|website=The Norton Anthology of English Literature|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his novel ''[[Salammbô (novel)|Salammbô]]'', [[Gustave Flaubert]] used ancient [[Carthage]] in North Africa as a [[foil (literature)|foil]] to ancient [[Rome]]. He portrayed its culture as morally corrupting and suffused with dangerously alluring eroticism. This novel proved hugely influential on later portrayals of ancient [[Semitic cultures]].

===In film===
Said argues that the continuity of Orientalism into the present can be found in influential images, particularly through the [[Cinema of the United States]], as the West has now grown to include the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Geographies of Postcolonialism|last = Sharp|first = Joanne|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] feature film, such as the ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' series, ''[[The Mummy (franchise)|The Mummy]]'' films, and Disney's ''[[Aladdin (franchise)|Aladdin]]'' film series demonstrate the imagined geographies of the East.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The films usually portray the lead heroic characters as being from the Western world, while the villains often come from the East.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The representation of the Orient has continued in film, although this representation does not necessarily have any truth to it.

The overly sexualized character of [[Princess Jasmine]] in ''Aladdin'' is simply a continuation of the paintings from the 19th century, where women were represented as erotic, sexualized male fantasies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Geographies of postcolonialism|last = Sharp|first = Joanne|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Teahouse of the August Moon (film)|The Tea House of the August Moon]]'' (1956), as argued by Pedro Iacobelli, there are tropes of orientalism. He notes, that the film "tells us more about the Americans and the American's image of Okinawa rather than about the Okinawan people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}} &lt;/ref&gt;The film characterizes the Okinawans as "merry but backward" and "de-politicized", which ignored the real-life Okinawan political protests over forceful land acquisition by the American military at the time.

Kimiko Akita, in "Orientalism and the Binary of Fact and Fiction in Memoirs of a Geisha", argues that ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'' (2005) contains orientalist tropes and deep "cultural misrepresentations". She states that ''Memoirs of a Geish]'' "reinforces the idea of Japanese culture and geisha as exotic, backward, irrational, dirty, profane, promiscuous, bizarre, and enigmatic".

===In dance===
During the Romantic Period of the 19th century, [[ballet]] developed a preoccupation with the exotic. This exoticism ranged from ballets set in Scotland to those based on ethereal creatures. By the later part of the century, ballets were capturing the presumed essence of the mysterious East. These ballets often included sexual themes and tended to be based on assumptions of people rather than on concrete facts. Orientalism is apparent in numerous ballets.

The Orient motivated several major ballets, which have survived since the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. ''Le Corsaire'' premiered in 1856 at the Paris Opera, with choreography by [[Joseph Mazilier]].&lt;ref name="abt corsaire"&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Corsaire|url=http://www.abt.org/education/archive/ballets/corsairefl.html|website=ABT|publisher=Ballet Theatre Foundation, Inc.|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marius Petipa]] re-choreographed the ballet for the Maryinsky Ballet in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1899.&lt;ref name="abt corsaire" /&gt; Its complex storyline, loosely based on Lord Byron's poem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Au|first1=Susan|title=Ballet and Modern Dance|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; takes place in Turkey and focuses on a love story between a pirate and a beautiful slave girl. Scenes include a bazaar where women are sold to men as slaves, and the Pasha's Palace, which features his harem of wives.&lt;ref name="abt corsaire" /&gt; In 1877, Marius Petipa choreographed ''La Bayadere'', the love story of an Indian temple dancer and Indian warrior. This ballet was based on Kalidasa's play ''Sakuntala''.&lt;ref name=Au&gt;{{cite book|last1=Au|first1=Susan|title=Ballet and Modern Dance|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson, Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Bayadere'' used vaguely Indian costuming, and incorporated Indian inspired hand gestures into classical ballet. In addition, it included a 'Hindu Dance,' motivated by Kathak, an Indian dance form.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Another ballet, ''Sheherazade'', choreographed by Michel Fokine in 1910 to music by Nicholas Rimsky-Korsakov, is a story involving a shah's wife and her illicit relations with a Golden Slave, originally played by Vaslav Nijinsky.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; The ballet's controversial fixation on sex includes an orgy in an oriental harem. When the shah discovers the actions of his numerous wives and their lovers, he orders the deaths of those involved.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; ''Sheherazade'' was loosely based on folktales of questionable authenticity.

Several lesser-known ballets of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century also reveal Orientalism. For instance, in Petipa's ''Pharaoh's Daughter'' (1862), an Englishman imagines himself, in an opium-induced dream, as an Egyptian boy who wins the love of the Pharaoh's daughter, Aspicia.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Aspicia's costume consisted of 'Egyptian' décor on a tutu.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Another ballet, Hippolyte Monplaisir's ''Brahma'', which premiered in 1868 in La Scala, Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jowitt|first1=Deborah|title=Time and the Dancing Image|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a story that involves romantic relations between a slave girl and Brahma, the Hindu god, when he visits earth.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; In addition, in 1909, Serge Diagilev included ''Cleopatra'' in Ballet's Russe's repertory. With its theme of sex, this revision of Fokine's ''Une Nuit d' Egypte'' combined the "exoticism and grandeur" that audiences of this time craved.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt;

As one of the pioneers of modern dance in America, [[Ruth St Denis]] also explored Orientalism in her dancing. Her dances were not authentic; she drew inspiration from photographs, books, and later from museums in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Au|first1=Susan|title=Ballet and modern Dance|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson, Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the exoticism of her dances catered to the interests of society women in America.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; She included ''Radha'' and ''The Cobras'' in her 'Indian' program in 1906. In addition, she found success in Europe with another Indian-themed ballet, ''The Nautch'' in 1908. In 1909, upon her return to America, St Denis created her first 'Egyptian' work, ''Egypta''.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Her preference for Orientalism continued, culminating with ''Ishtar of the Seven Gates'' in 1923, about a Babylonian goddess.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt;

While Orientalism in dance climaxed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it is still present in modern times. For instance, major ballet companies regularly perform ''Le Corsaire'', ''La Bayadere'', and ''Sheherazade''. Furthermore, Orientalism is also found within newer versions of ballets. In versions of ''The Nutcracker'', such as the 2010 [[American Ballet Theatre]] production, the Chinese dance uses an arm position with the arms bent at a ninety-degree angle and the index fingers pointed upwards, while the Arabian dance uses two dimensional bent arm movements. Inspired by ballets of the past, stereotypical 'Oriental' movements and arm positions have developed and remain.

==Religion==
{{Spirituality sidebar|orientalist}}
An exchange of Western and Eastern ideas about spirituality developed as the West traded with and established colonies in Asia.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} The first Western translation of a Sanskrit text appeared in 1785,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=176}} marking the growing interest in Indian culture and languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=177}} Translations of the ''Upanishads'', which [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] called "the consolation of my life", first appeared in 1801 and 1802.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=177-178}}{{refn|group=note|Schopenhauer also called his poodle "Atman".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=178}}}} Early translations also appeared in other European languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=183-184}} 19th-century [[transcendentalism]] was influenced by Asian spirituality, prompting [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803–1882) to pioneer the idea of spirituality as a distinct field.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Leigh Eric. ''Restless Souls: The Making of American Spirituality''. San Francisco: Harper, 2005. {{ISBN|0-06-054566-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major force in the mutual influence of Eastern and Western [[spirituality]] and religiosity was the [[Theosophical Society]],{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=185-188}}{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} a group searching for ancient wisdom from the East and spreading Eastern religious ideas in the West.{{sfn|Lavoie|2012}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} One of its salient features was the belief in "[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom (Theosophy)|Masters of Wisdom]]",{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Ascended Master Teachings]]}} "beings, human or once human, who have transcended the normal frontiers of knowledge, and who make their wisdom available to others".{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}} The Theosophical Society also spread Western ideas in the East, contributing to its modernisation and a growing nationalism in the Asian colonies.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}

The Theosophical Society had a major influence on [[Buddhist modernism]]{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and [[Hindu reform movements]].{{sfn|Sinari|2000}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} Between 1878 and 1882, the Society and the [[Arya Samaj]] were united as the [[Theosophical Society of the Arya Samaj]].{{sfn|Johnson|1994|p=107}} [[Helena Blavatsky]], along with [[Henry Steel Olcott|H. S. Olcott]] and [[Anagarika Dharmapala]], was instrumental in the Western transmission and revival of [[Theravada Buddhism]].{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=98}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1996|p=185-188}}{{sfn|Fields|1992|p=83-118}}

Another major influence was [[Vivekananda]],{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=189-193}}{{sfn|Michaelson|2009|p=79-81}} who popularised his modernised interpretation{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}} of [[Advaita Vedanta]] during the later 19th and early 20th century in both India and the West,{{sfn|Michaelson|2009|p=79-81}} emphasising ''anubhava'' ("personal experience") over scriptural authority.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=1}}

The term "re-orientalism" was used by Lisa Lau and Ana Cristina Mendes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/886477672|title=Re-orientalism and South Asian identity politics : the oriental other within|last=editor.|first=Lau, Lisa, editor.

"Re-Orientalism differs from Orientalism in its manner of and reasons for referencing the West: while challenging the metanarratives of Orientalism, re-Orientalism sets up alternative metanarratives of its own in order to articulate eastern identities, simultaneously deconstructing and reinforcing Orientalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendes|first=Ana Cristina|last2=Lau|first2=Lisa|date=December 2014|title=India through re-Orientalist Lenses|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F1369801X.2014.984619|journal=Interventions|language=en|volume=17|issue=5|pages=706–727|doi=10.1080/1369801x.2014.984619|issn=1369-801X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[Occidentalism]]" is often used to refer to negative views of the Western world found in Eastern societies and is founded on the sense of nationalism that spread in reaction to colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url =http://www.erudit.org/revue/jcha/2006/v17/n2/016587ar.pdf |title = Edward Said: Orientalism and Occidentalism|last = Lary|first = Diana|date = 2006|journal = Journal of the Canadian Historical Association / Revue de la Société historique du Canada|volume = 17| number = 2 |p = 3–15|doi = 10.7202/016587ar|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The action of "[[othering]]" cultures occurs when groups are labeled as different due to characteristics that distinguish them from the perceived norm.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Other|last = Mountz|first = Alison|date = |journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Said]], the author of the book ''Orientalism'', argued that western powers and influential individuals such as social scientists and artists othered "the Orient".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The evolution of ideologies is often initially embedded in the language, and continues to ripple through the fabric of society by taking over the culture, economy and political sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Orientalism at Home: The Case of 'Canada's Toughest Neighbourhood'|last = Richardson|first = Chris|date = 2014|journal = Project Muse|volume = 27|pages = 75|doi = 10.3828/bjcs.2014.5|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Said's criticism of Western Orientalism is based on what he describes as articularizing trends. These ideologies are present in Asian works by Indian, Chinese, and Japanese writers and artists, in their views of Western culture and tradition.

A particularly significant development is the manner in which Orientalism has taken shape in non-Western cinema, as for instance in Hindi cinema.

Said has been accused of Occidentalizing the west in his critique Orientalism, ''i.e.'' of being guilty of falsely characterizing the West in the same way that he accuses Western scholars of falsely characterizing the East.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Geographies of Postcolonialism|last = Sharp|first = Jo|publisher = Sage|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-4129-0778-1|location = London|pages = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said essentialized the west by creating a homogeneous image of the area. Currently, the west consists not only of Europe, but also the United States, which has become more influential and dominant over the years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''The Pan-European Institute''' (PEI) ([[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''Pan-Eurooppa Instituutti'') is a [[Finland|Finnish]] research institute at [[Turku School of Economics]], in [[Turku]], Finland. PEI observes developments within the European economy and business with special interest lies on the [[Baltic Sea]] region and its neighbouring countries such as [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]]. Kari Liuhto is director and is assisted by an [http://www.tse.fi/EN/units/specialunits/pei/Pages/Advisory-Board.aspx advisory board] of 12 members. The Pan-European Institute celebrates its 25th anniversary in 2012 by organising a high-level seminar "[http://www.tse.fi/EN/UNITS/SPECIALUNITS/PEI/Pages/AnniversarySeminar.aspx The  Baltic Sea region 2025]". 

== Research, education, and partnerships ==
The research conducted by PEI is for external purposes, as well as internal. Cooperation has been successful on the national arena with the Academy of Finland, several Finnish ministries, the [[Parliament of Finland]] and the Prime Minister’s Office. Abroad, partners have been the [[European Commission]], the [[European Parliament]], the [[United Nations]], and the [[World Bank]].

The research also provides a foundation for the education provided at Turku School of Economics at the University of Turku. The Pan-European Institute provides several university courses in English within the subject of [http://www.tse.fi/EN/units/departmentsandunits/kv/Pages/default.aspx International Business]. The institute is also a partner of the [http://europeanstudies.utu.fi/studies/ European Studies programme] and the [http://balticstudies.utu.fi/nondegree/businessandsociety/ Baltic Sea Business &amp; Society programme].

Research at PEI has five focus areas:
* Economic and business development in the Baltic Sea region 
* Economic relations between EU and its bordering nations with special attention on Russia, [[Kaliningrad]], and the [[Northern Dimension]]
* [[Foreign direct investment]] (FDI) inflow into and outflow from Russia 
* Regional and social development in Europe 
* [[Small and medium enterprises]] (SMEs) in the EU and its eastern neighbours

== Economic and security monitoring ==
PEI especially monitors economic development in these areas:
* '''The Baltic Sea region''': The quarterly discussion forum [http://www.tse.fi/EN/units/specialunits/pei/economicmonitoring/bre/Pages/default.aspx Baltic Rim Economies (BRE)] focuses on the development of the Baltic Sea region. In BRE, high-level public and corporate decision makers, representatives of academia and several other experts participate.
* '''Russian regions''' and '''regional centres''' as well as [http://www.tse.fi/EN/units/specialunits/pei/economicmonitoring/emergingmarkets/Pages/default.aspx '''European emerging markets''']: for these markets, PEI provides visual information packages with economic information in a nutshell. The packages are mainly aimed at foreign investors and international companies.
* '''International operations of Russian firms''': Due to increased significance of Russian companies in Finland, the Pan-European Institute follows [http://www.tse.fi/EN/units/specialunits/pei/economicmonitoring/russianfirms/Pages/default.aspx international operations of Russian firms] and their impact on Finnish business.

Through a partnership with the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, PEI has monitored the security development (2010-2011) in Europe. The regions covered in this [http://www.tse.fi/FI/yksikot/erillislaitokset/pei/Documents/Regional%20Security%20Report%20II_final.pdf biannual review] are the Western CIS (Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus), the South Caucasus (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia) and Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tadzhikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan).

'''''Quercus suber''''', commonly called the '''cork oak''',  is a medium-sized, [[evergreen]] [[oak]] tree in the section [[Quercus section Cerris|''Quercus'' sect. ''Cerris'']]. It is the primary source of [[cork (material)|cork]] for wine bottle stoppers and other uses, such as cork flooring and as the cores of [[cricket ball]]s.  It is native to southwest Europe and northwest [[Africa]]. In the [[Mediterranean basin]] the tree is an ancient species with [[fossil]] remnants dating back to the [[Tertiary period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eriksson, E.|author2=Varela, M.C.|author3=Lumaret, R.|author4=Gil, L.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Genetic conservation of Quercus suber|publisher=European Forest Genetic Resources Programme ([[EUFORGEN]]), [[Bioversity International]]|date=2017|url=http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin/templates/euforgen.org/upload/Publications/Thematic_publications/Quercus_TB_OpenSourceCR_web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It grows to up to {{cvt|20|m}}, although it is typically more stunted in its native environment. The leaves are {{cvt|4|to|7|cm}} long, weakly lobed or coarsely toothed, dark green above, paler beneath, with the leaf margins often downcurved. The [[acorn]]s are {{cvt|2|to|3|cm}} long, in a deep cup fringed with elongated scales.

In the Portuguese town of [[Águas de Moura]] is located the Sobreiro Monumental (Monumental Cork Oak), a tree 234 years old, {{convert|16|m}} tall and with a trunk that requires at least five people to embrace it. It has been considered a National Monument since 1988, and the Guinness Book of Records states it as the largest and oldest in the world.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Ecology==
The cork oak forest is one of the major plant communities of the [[Mediterranean woodlands and forests]] [[ecoregion]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/pa1214 Mediterranean Woodland and Forest Ecoregion: Northern Africa: Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.] World Wildlife Fund. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural stands of cork oak can support [[biodiversity|diverse]] [[ecosystems]]. For example, in parts of northwestern [[North Africa]], some cork oak forests are [[habitat]] to the [[endangered]] [[Barbary macaque]], ''Macaca sylvanus'', a species whose habitat is fragmented and whose range was prehistorically much wider.&lt;ref name=hogan&gt;Hogan, C.M.
 [https://web.archive.org/web/20090831095518/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=31757 Barbary Macaque, ''Macaca sylvanus''.] GlobalTwitcher.com, Ed. N. Stromberg.&lt;/ref&gt; In Western Europe, particularly in [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], the cork oak forests are home to endangered species such as the [[Iberian lynx]], the most critically threatened feline in the world.&lt;ref name=santos&gt;Santos Pereira, J., Bugalho, M.N., and Caldeira, M.D. (2008). [http://www.apcor.pt/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/From-the-Cork-Oak-to-Cork-a-sustainable-system.pdf ''From the Cork Oak to Cork: A Sustainable Ecosystem''.] APCOR: Portuguese Cork Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[pyrophyte]], this tree has a thick, insulating bark that makes it well adapted to [[forest fire]]s. After a fire, many tree species regenerate from seeds (as, for example, the [[maritime pine]]) or resprout from the base of the tree (as, for example, the [[holm oak]]). The bark of the cork oak allows it to survive fires and then simply regrow branches to fill out the canopy. The quick regeneration of this oak makes it successful in the fire-adapted ecosystems of the [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean biome]].&lt;ref name=santos/&gt;

==Cultivation and use==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2011}}
[[File:Cork oak trunk section.jpg|thumb|A cross section of the trunk of a cork oak]]
The tree forms a thick, rugged [[Bark (botany)|bark]] containing high levels of [[suberin]]. Over time the [[cork cambium]] layer of bark can develop considerable thickness and can be harvested every 7 to 10 years to produce [[Cork (material)|cork]]. The harvesting of cork does not harm the tree, in fact, no trees are cut down during the harvesting process. Only the bark is extracted, and a new layer of cork regrows, making it a [[renewable resource]]. The tree is cultivated in [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Tunisia]]. Cork oaks are considered to be soil builders and their fruits have been shown to have useful insecticidal properties. Cork oak forests cover approximately 25,000 square kilometres in those countries (equivalent to {{convert|2,500,000|ha}}). Portugal accounts for around 50% of the world cork harvest. Cork oaks cannot legally be cut down in Portugal, except for [[forestry|forest management]] felling of old, unproductive trees, and, even in those cases, farmers need special permission from the Ministry of Agriculture.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

''Q. suber'' is commonly grown in [[agroforestry]] systems, known as ''montado'' in [[Portugal]] and ''dehesa'' in Spain. These are open woods with low tree density (50–300 trees/ha). In these systems, [[forage]] species are commonly grown under the trees and grazed by [[cattle]] during the summer.&lt;ref name='gil08'&gt;{{citation |author=Gil, L. |author2=Varela, M. |last-author-amp=yes|title=Cork oak - ''Quercus suber'': Technical guidelines for genetic conservation and use|date=2008 |pages=6 |url=http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin//bioversity/publications/pdfs/1323_Cork_oak__Quercus_suber_.pdf |publisher=[[European Forest Genetic Resources Programme]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cork oaks commonly live more than 200 years.&lt;ref name=santos/&gt; Virgin cork (or 'male' cork) is the first cork cut from generally 25-year-old trees. Another 9 to 12 years is required for the second harvest, and a tree can be harvested about twelve times in its lifetime. Cork harvesting is done entirely without machinery, being dependent solely on human labor. Usually five people are required to harvest the tree's bark, using a small axe. The process requires training due to the skill required to harvest bark without harming the tree. The European cork industry produces 300,000 [[tonne]]s of cork a year, with a value of [[Euro|€]]1.5 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] and employing 30,000 people. [[Wine]] corks represent 15% of cork usage by weight but 66% of revenues.

The cork left after stoppers have been made is used to make a wide range of products, including insulation panels, floor and wall tiles and [[sound-proofing]] in the car industry, as well as for [[handicrafts]] and artistic uses. This include ''cork paper'', used in printing, book covering, clothing manufacture, cork ''maroquinerie'' and other products. Cork is also used in making [[cricket ball]]s, Hurling Ball (Sliothars), badminton shuttlecocks, handles of fishing rods and special devices for the [[space industry]].&lt;ref name='gil08'/&gt;

Cork oaks are sometimes planted as individual trees, providing a minor income to their owners. The tree is also sometimes cultivated for ornament. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrids]] with turkey oak (''[[Quercus cerris]]'') are regular, both in the wild in southwest Europe and in cultivation; the hybrid is known as Lucombe oak ''Quercus'' × ''hispanica''. Some cork is also produced in eastern [[Asia]] from the related Chinese cork oak (''[[Quercus variabilis]]'')

==Pathogens==
Cork oak is relatively resistant to pathogens, but some diseases occur in the species. [[Leaf spot]] can be caused by the fungus ''[[Apiognomonia errabunda]]''. Other fungi can cause leaf scorching, [[powdery mildew]], [[Rust (fungus)|rust]], and [[canker]]s.&lt;ref name=mor&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moricca |first1=Salvatore |last2=Linaldeddu |first2=Benedetto T. |last3=Ginetti |first3=Beatrice |last4=Scanu |first4=Bruno |last5=Franceschini |first5=Antonio |last6=Ragazzi |first6=Alessandro |title=Endemic and Emerging Pathogens Threatening Cork Oak Trees: Management Options for Conserving a Unique Forest Ecosystem |journal=Plant Disease |date=2016 |volume=100 |issue=11 |pages=2184–2193 |doi=10.1094/PDIS-03-16-0408-FE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most virulent cork oak pathogen may be ''[[Diplodia corticola]]'', a [[Ascomycota|sac fungus]] which causes sap-bleeding sunken canker wounds in the wood, withering of the leaves, and lesions on the acorns. The fungus ''[[Biscogniauxia mediterranea]]'' is becoming more common in cork oak forests. Its fruiting bodies appear as charcoal-black cankers. Both of these fungi are transmitted by the [[Platypus cylindrus|oak pinhole borer]] (''Platypus cylindrus''), a species of weevil.&lt;ref name=mor/&gt;

The common water mould ''[[Phytophthora cinnamomi]]'' grows in the roots of the tree and has been known to devastate cork oak woodlands.&lt;ref name=mor/&gt;

{{Performing arts}}
'''Shadowgraphy''' or '''ombromanie''' is the art of performing a story or show using images made by hand shadows. It can be called "cinema in silhouette". Performers are titled as a shadowgraphist or shadowgrapher.

The art has declined since the late 19th century when electricity became available to homes because light bulbs and electric lamps do not give off good shadows and because cinema and television were becoming a new form of entertainment. Shadows are greatly defined by candlelight; therefore hand shadows were common in earlier centuries.

The modern art of hand shadows was made popular by the French entertainer [[Félicien Trewey]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quick-change-artistry.com/shadowgraphy.html Quick Change Artistry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He popularized the art by making silhouettes of famous personalities.

== Origin ==
Since shadows have existed since the existence of objects obstructing light, it is hard to say when the art was first used by humans for entertainment. It could have been practiced by ancient or later humans, but it probably originated in the [[Far East]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Art of Hand Shadows by Albert Almoznino&lt;/ref&gt; The French entertainer Félicien Trewey was interested in the art of Chinese [[shadow puppet]]ry called Ombres Chinoises, which means "Chinese shadows". He popularized the art of hand shadows when he developed shadows of famous silhouettes. It then became popular in [[Europe]] in the 19th century.

== Prevalence ==
Although the art is popular amongst different kinds of entertainers it seems prominent amongst magicians, because it was popularized by a magician who inspired many other magicians.&lt;ref name="geniimagazine.com"&gt;[http://www.geniimagazine.com/wiki/index.php/Shadowgraphy Shadowgraphy - MagicPedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Félicien Trewey perfected the widely known elephant, bird, and cat hand shadows&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofshadowgraph00trewuoft#page/4/mode/2up The art of shadowgraphy; how it is done&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and created some of his own such as The Volunteer, [[Robinson Crusoe]], The Jockey, The Rope Dancer and more.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofshadowgraph00trewuoft#page/6/mode/2up The art of shadowgraphy; how it is done&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, Trewey joined with [[Alexander Herrmann]] who most likely learned it from him. David Tobias Bamberg most likely learned it from Alexander who then passed it down to his son [[Okito]] (Tobias Leendert Bamberg) who then passed it down to ''his'' son [[David (Fu Manchu) Bamberg|Fu Manchu]] (David Theodore Bamberg). Fu Manchu passed his skill to Marcelo Contento, one of his apprentices, who became famous worldwide for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=MUM Magazine, March 2000|last=|first=|publisher=Society of American Magicians|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=26|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contento died before he could pass it on to his son.

Other magicians who used hand shadows in their act include [[David Devant]], [[Edward Victor]], and the duo [[Max Holden (magic)|Holden and Graham]] in which Holden was famous for his "Monkey in the Belfry" shadow.&lt;ref name="geniimagazine.com"/&gt;

== Tools ==

=== Hands ===
[[File:Gale's Guernsey shadowgraphy.jpg|thumb|right|An 1889 advertisement with examples of hand shadows]]
The hands and fingers are exercised and different finger positions are practiced to help aid in forming shadows.

=== Light source ===
The light source to be used should be small and bright. The best shadows come from light proceeding from the smallest possible point.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oTZo_mLHCs4C&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true Modern Conjuring for Amateurs - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Almoznino suggests a candle, a flashlight (with the lens and reflector removed) or any very small light. If a bulb is used, it should be clear. J. C. Cannell suggests in his book, ''Modern Conjuring For Amateurs'', that the best source of light is the [[electric arc]], which Almoznino agrees to the small [[arc lamp]], and the second best being the [[limelight]] (if used with a high-class jet). Trewey suggests the chalk for the limelight to be cut in a triangular form, or else it will produce a gray border around the shadow. Cannell states another favorite amongst shadowgraphists is the use of [[acetylene gas]] (i.e. acetylene gas lamp or [[carbide lamp]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oTZo_mLHCs4C&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true Modern Conjuring for Amateurs - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays it is possible to use a single lensless (for example, SMD) LED.

=== Blank surface ===
Albert Almoznino suggests to use a white or light-colored wall, sheet or table cloth for a small audience as in a private home. If a wall is dark-colored, the sheet or table cloth can be hung against it. If performing for a large audience such as in an auditorium or on a stage, he suggests a screen made of [[muslin]] or other thin cloth attached to a frame. In a nightclub, hall or small theater, he suggests a nylon screen on a pliable aluminum frame. It is a screen sometimes used for TV projection called a [[rear projection screen]], but the light must be stronger like a small spotlight without the projector, lenses, or diffusers, or a motion-picture projector with the front lenses removed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Performance ==
The performer sits or stands between the light source and the blank surface, while having the option to perform in front of the performance surface or behind it, with each having different advantages. The performer has another option to perform from the left or the right of the light source. The farther the hands are from the light, the smaller the shadows will be, while the closer the hands are to the light, the larger the shadows will be. Also, the closer the hands are to the blank surface, the sharper the shadows will be. Trewey suggests that the most convenient distance for the light from the hands is four feet while the hands from the performance surface should be about six feet. The performer should always watch their shadows instead of their hands.

Movement helps give the shadows character and brings them to life. Some shadows are performed with accessories attached to the hands or fingers to achieve movements or images not applicable to hands alone.

[[Structural engineering]] depends upon a detailed knowledge of [[Structural load|loads]], [[physics]] and [[Building material|material]]s to understand and predict how structures support and resist self-weight and imposed loads. To apply the knowledge successfully structural engineers will need a detailed knowledge of [[mathematics]] and of relevant empirical and theoretical design codes. They will also need to know about the [[corrosion]] resistance of the materials and structures, especially when those structures are exposed to the external environment.

The criteria which govern the design of a structure are either serviceability (criteria which define whether the structure is able to adequately fulfill its function) or strength (criteria which define whether a structure is able to safely support and resist its design loads). A structural engineer designs a structure to have sufficient [[Strength of materials|strength]] and [[stiffness]] to meet these criteria.

Loads imposed on structures are supported by means of forces transmitted through structural elements. These forces can manifest themselves as [[Tension (physics)|tension]] (axial force), [[compression (physical)|compression]] (axial force), [[Shear stress|shear]], and [[bending]], or [[flexure]] (a bending moment is a force multiplied by a distance, or lever arm, hence producing a turning effect or [[torque]]).

==Strength==
[[Strength of materials|Strength]] depends upon material properties. The strength of a material depends on its capacity to withstand axial [[stress (mechanics)|stress]], [[shear stress]], bending, and torsion. The strength of a material is measured in force per unit area (newtons per square millimetre or N/mm², or the equivalent megapascals or MPa in the SI system and often pounds per square inch psi in the United States Customary Units system).

A structure fails the strength criterion when the [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] (force divided by area of material) induced by the loading is greater than the capacity of the structural material to resist the load without breaking, or when the [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] (percentage extension) is so great that the element no longer fulfills its function ([[Yield (engineering)|yield]]).

See also:
{{See also|Tensile strength|Compressive strength|Shear strength}}

==Stiffness==
[[Stiffness]] depends upon material properties and [[geometry]]. The stiffness of a structural element of a given material is the product of the material's [[Young's modulus]] and the element's [[second moment of area]]. Stiffness is measured in force per unit length (newtons per millimetre or N/mm), and is equivalent to the 'force constant' in [[Hooke's Law]].

The [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] of a structure under loading is dependent on its stiffness. The [[dynamic response]] of a structure to dynamic loads (the [[natural frequency]] of a structure) is also dependent on its stiffness.

In a structure made up of multiple structural elements where the surface distributing the forces to the elements is rigid, the elements will carry loads in proportion to their relative stiffness - the stiffer an element, the more load it will attract. This means that load/stiffness ratio, which is deflection, remains same in two connected (jointed) elements.  In a structure where the surface distributing the forces to the elements is flexible (like a wood framed structure), the elements will carry loads in proportion to their relative tributary areas.

A structure is considered to fail the chosen serviceability criteria if it is insufficiently stiff to have acceptably small [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] or [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] response under loading.

The inverse of stiffness is [[flexibility (engineering)|flexibility]].

{{See also|Flexibility method|Direct stiffness method}}

==Safety factors==
The safe design of structures requires a design approach which takes account of the [[statistics|statistical]] likelihood of the failure of the structure. Structural design codes are based upon the assumption that both the loads and the material strengths vary with a [[normal distribution]].

The job of the structural engineer is to ensure that the chance of overlap between the distribution of loads on a structure and the distribution of material strength of a structure is acceptably small (it is impossible to reduce that chance to zero).

It is normal to apply a ''[[safety factor|partial safety factor]]'' to the loads and to the material strengths, to design using 95th percentiles (two [[standard deviations]] from the [[mean]]). The safety factor applied to the load will typically ensure that in 95% of times the actual load will be smaller than the design load, while the factor applied to the strength ensures that 95% of times the actual strength will be higher than the design strength.

The safety factors for material strength vary depending on the material and the use it is being put to and on the design codes applicable in the country or region.

===Load cases===
{{Globalize|date=December 2010}}
A '''load case''' is a combination of different types of loads with safety factors applied to them. A structure is checked for strength and serviceability against all the load cases it is likely to experience during its lifetime.

Typical load cases for design for strength (ultimate load cases; ULS) are:

: ''1.2 x Dead Load + 1.6 x Live Load''
: ''1.2 x Dead Load + 1.2 x Live Load + 1.2 x Wind Load''

A typical load case for design for serviceability (characteristic load cases; SLS) is:

: ''1.0 x Dead Load + 1.0 x Live Load''

Different load cases would be used for different loading conditions. For example, in the case of design for fire a load case of ''1.0 x Dead Load + 0.8 x Live Load'' may be used, as it is reasonable to assume everyone has left the building if there is a fire.

In multi-story buildings it is normal to reduce the total live load depending on the number of stories being supported, as the probability of maximum load being applied to all floors simultaneously is negligibly small.

It is not uncommon for large buildings to require hundreds of different load cases to be considered in the design.

==Newton's laws of motion==
{{Main|Newton's laws of motion}}

The most important natural laws for structural engineering are [[Newton's Laws of Motion]]

Newton's first law states that ''every body perseveres in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by force impressed.''

Newton's second law states that ''the rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the resultant force acting on the body and is in the same direction.'' Mathematically, F=ma (force = mass x acceleration).

Newton's third law states that ''all forces occur in pairs, and these two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.''

With these laws it is possible to understand the forces on a structure and how that structure will resist them. The Third Law requires that for a structure to be stable all the internal and external forces must be in [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]]. This means that the sum of all internal and external forces on a ''[[free-body diagram]]'' must be zero:

* &lt;math&gt; \sum \vec F = 0 &lt;/math&gt;: the vectorial sum of the [[force]]s acting on the body equals zero. This translates to
::Σ ''H'' = 0: the sum of the horizontal components of the forces equals zero;
::Σ ''V'' = 0: the sum of the vertical components of forces equals zero;
* &lt;math&gt; \sum \vec M = 0 &lt;/math&gt;: the sum of the [[moment (physics)|moment]]s (about an arbitrary point) of all forces equals zero.

==Statical determinacy==
{{Main|Statically indeterminate}}

A structural engineer must understand the internal and external forces of a structural system consisting of structural elements and nodes at their intersections.

A statically determinate structure can be fully analysed using only consideration of equilibrium, from Newton's Laws of Motion.

A statically indeterminate structure has more unknowns than equilibrium considerations can supply equations for (see [[simultaneous equations]]). Such a system can be solved using consideration of equations of ''compatibility'' between geometry and deflections in addition to equilibrium equations, or by using [[virtual work]].

If a system is made up of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; bars, &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; pin joints and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; support reactions, then it cannot be statically determinate if the following relationship does not hold:

&lt;math&gt;r + b = 2j&lt;/math&gt;

It should be noted that even if this relationship does hold, a structure can be arranged in such a way as to be statically indeterminate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Structural Modeling and Analysis|author=Dym, Clive L.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1997|isbn=0-521-49536-9|pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elasticity==
{{Main|Elasticity (physics)|l1=Elasticity}}
{{See also|Hooke's Law}}

Much engineering design is based on the assumption that materials behave elastically. For most materials this assumption is incorrect, but empirical evidence has shown that design using this assumption can be safe. Materials that are elastic obey Hooke's Law, and plasticity does not occur.

For systems that obey Hooke's Law, the extension produced is directly proportional to the load:
:&lt;math&gt; \vec{\mathbf{F}}=k\vec{\mathbf{x}} \ &lt;/math&gt;
where
: ''x'' is the distance that the spring has been stretched or compressed away from the equilibrium position, which is the position where the spring would naturally come to rest [usually in meters],
: ''F'' is the restoring force exerted by the material [usually in newtons], and
: ''k'' is the '''force constant''' (or '''spring constant'''). This is the [[stiffness]] of the spring. The constant has units of force per unit length (usually in [[Newton (unit)|newtons]] per [[metre]])

==Plasticity==
[[File:Tresca stress 2D.png|right|thumb|Comparison of Tresca and Von Mises Criteria]]
{{Main|Plasticity (physics)|l1=Plasticity}}

Some design is based on the assumption that materials will behave [[Plasticity (physics)|plastically]].&lt;ref name=Heyman1&gt;{{cite book|title=Structural Analysis: A Historical Approach|author=Heyman, Jacques|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1998|isbn=0-521-62249-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plastic material is one which does not obey Hooke's Law, and therefore deformation is not proportional to the applied load. Plastic materials are [[ductile]] materials. Plasticity theory can be used for some reinforced concrete structures assuming they are underreinforced, meaning that the steel reinforcement fails before the concrete does.

Plasticity theory states that the point at which a structure collapses (reaches yield) lies between an upper and a lower bound on the load, defined as follows:

*If, for a given external load, it is possible to find a distribution of moments that satisfies equilibrium requirements, with the moment not exceeding the yield moment at any location, and if the boundary conditions are satisfied, then the given load is a '''lower bound''' on the collapse load.
*If, for a small increment of displacement the internal work done by the structure, assuming that the moment at every plastic hinge is equal to the yield moment and that the boundary conditions are satisfied, is equal to the external work done by the given load for that same small increment of displacement, then that load is an '''upper bound''' on the collapse load.

If the correct collapse load is found, the two methods will give the same result for the collapse load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Design of Concrete Structures|author1=Nilson, Arthur H. |author2=Darwin, David |author3=Dolan, Charles W. |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|date=2004|isbn=0-07-248305-9|pages=486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plasticity theory depends upon a correct understanding of when yield will occur. A number of different models for stress distribution and approximations to the [[yield surface]] of plastic materials exist:&lt;ref name=Heyman&gt;{{cite book|title=The Science of Structural Engineering|author=Heyman, Jacques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Au34lwRovHIC&amp;dq=Leonhard+Euler+Daniel+Bernoulli+Beam+equation|date=1999|publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn=1-86094-189-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Euler-Bernoulli beam equation==
[[File:deflection.svg|thumb|right|Deflection of a cantilever under a point load (f) in engineering]]
{{Main|Euler-Bernoulli beam equation}}

The Euler-Bernoulli beam equation defines the behaviour of a beam element (see below). It is based on five assumptions:

(1) [[continuum mechanics]] is valid for a bending beam&lt;br /&gt;
(2) the [[Stress (physics)|stress]] at a [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]] varies linearly in the direction of bending, and is zero at the [[centroid]] of every [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]].&lt;br /&gt;
(3) the bending [[moment (physics)|moment]] at a particular cross section varies linearly with the second derivative of the deflected shape at that location.&lt;br /&gt;
(4) the beam is composed of an isotropic material&lt;br /&gt;(5) the applied load is orthogonal to the beam's neutral axis and acts in a unique plane.

A simplified version of Euler-Bernoulli beam equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;EI \frac{d^4 u}{d x^4} = w(x).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the deflection and &lt;math&gt;w(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a load per unit length. &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the [[elastic modulus]] and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[second moment of area]], the product of these giving the [[stiffness]] of the beam.

This equation is very common in engineering practice: it describes the deflection of a uniform, static beam.

Successive derivatives of u have important meaning:

:* &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{u}\,&lt;/math&gt;  is the deflection.

:* &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}}\,&lt;/math&gt;  is the slope of the beam.

:* &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{EI\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}}\,&lt;/math&gt;  is the [[Bending|bending moment]] in the beam.

:* &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(EI\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\right)}\,&lt;/math&gt;  is the [[Shearing (physics)|shear force]] in the beam.

A bending moment manifests itself as a tension and a compression force, acting as a [[Couple (mechanics)|couple]] in a beam. The stresses caused by these forces can be represented by:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \frac{My}{I} = E y \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the stress, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the bending moment, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the [[neutral axis]] of the beam to the point under consideration and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[second moment of area]]. Often the equation is simplified to the moment divided by the section modulus (S), which is I/y. This equation allows a structural engineer to assess the stress in a structural element when subjected to a bending moment.

==Buckling==
{{Main|Buckling}}
[[File:Buckled column.svg|thumb|A column under a centric axial load exhibiting the characteristic deformation of buckling.]]

When subjected to compressive forces it is possible for structural elements to deform significantly due to the destabilising effect of that load. The effect can be initiated or exacerbated by possible inaccuracies in manufacture or construction.

The Euler buckling formula defines the axial compression force which will cause a [[strut]] (or column) to fail in buckling.

:&lt;math&gt;F=\frac{\pi^2 EI}{(Kl)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; = maximum or critical [[force]] (vertical load on column),
:&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; = [[modulus of elasticity]],
:&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; = [[area moment of inertia]], or second moment of area
:&lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; = unsupported length of column,
:&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; = column effective length factor, whose value depends on the conditions of end support of the column, as follows.
::For both ends pinned (hinged, free to rotate), &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; = 1.0.
::For both ends fixed, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; = 0.50.
::For one end fixed and the other end pinned, &lt;math&gt;K\approx&lt;/math&gt; 0.70.
::For one end fixed and the other end free to move laterally, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; = 2.0.

This value is sometimes expressed for design purposes as a critical buckling [[stress (mechanics)|stress]].

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=\frac{\pi^2 E}{(\frac{Kl}{r})^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; = maximum or critical [[stress (mechanics)|stress]]
:&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; = the least [[radius of gyration]] of the cross section

Other forms of buckling include lateral torsional buckling, where the compression flange of a beam in bending will buckle, and buckling of plate elements in plate girders due to compression in the plane of the plate.

[[File:Congres Team 10 in Otterlo - Team 10 Meeting in Otterlo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Otterlo]] Meeting 1959 (also CIAM '59), organized by Team 10, 43 participants. Meeting place: [[Kröller-Müller Museum]], located in the [[Hoge Veluwe National Park]]. Dissolution of the organization CIAM.]]
'''Team 10''' — just as often referred to as '''Team X''' or '''Team Ten''' — was a group of architects and other invited participants who assembled starting in July 1953 at the 9th Congress of the [[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne|International Congresses of Modern Architecture (CIAM)]] and created a schism within CIAM by challenging its doctrinaire approach to [[urbanism]].

==Membership==
The group's first formal meeting under the name of Team 10 took place in [[Bagnols-sur-Cèze]] in 1960. The last, with only four members present, was in Lisbon in 1981.

Team 10's core group consists of [[Pancho Guedes]], Rolf Gutmann, [[Geir Grung (architect)|Geir Grung]], Oskar Hansen,&lt;ref&gt;Stanek, L. ed., Team 10 East. Revisionist Architecture in Real Existing Modernism (Warsaw: Museum of Modern Art/ Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reima Pietilä]], Charles Polonyi, Brian Richards, [[Jerzy Soltan]], [[Oswald Mathias Ungers]], [[John Voelcker]], and Stefan Wewerka.

They referred to themselves as "a small family group of architects who have sought each other out because each has found the help of the others necessary to the development and understanding of their own individual work."&lt;ref name="alison"&gt;Smithson, Alison [ed] ''Team 10 Primer'', [[MIT Press|The MIT Press]], (1968), {{ISBN|0-289-79556-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team 10's theoretical framework, disseminated primarily through teaching and publications, had a profound influence on the development of architectural thought in the second half of the 20th century, primarily in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Two different movements emerged from Team 10: the [[New Brutalism]] of the English members (Alison and Peter Smithson) and the [[Structuralism (architecture)|Structuralism]] of the Dutch members (Aldo van Eyck and Jacob Bakema).

==History==
Team 10's core group started meeting within the context of CIAM, the international platform for modern architects founded in 1928.&lt;ref name="Team10online Intro"&gt;http://www.team10online.org [http://www.team10online.org/team10/introduction.html ''Introduction - The Team 10 story''] by Max Risselada &amp; Dirk van den Heuvel.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Siddham''' or the '''Asia Inscriptions Database''' is an open-access resource for the study of inscriptions from South, Central and South East Asia. Siddham was established by the [[European Research Council]] with start-up funding from the project [[Beyond Boundaries: Religion, Region, Language and the State]].  The first focus of Siddham is [[Sanskrit]] [[epigraphy]], mainly of the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries CE, but the platform is designed to accommodate inscriptions from all periods. In South Asia alone, the estimated number of historic inscriptions is 90,000.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, Richard. ''Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the Other Indo-Aryan Languages''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In its next phases, Siddham will expand to include inscriptions in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Kannada]], [[Prakrit]], [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Pyu language (Burma)|Pyu]] and [[Mon language|Mon]]. 

==Etymology==
In [[Sanskrit]] ''siddhaṃ'' means "success, accomplished, perfected." It was also symbolism and substitution for an "auspicious sign" found in the oldest inscriptions of the South Asia. In some cases, siddham is not spelled out, but indicated with a sign such as ''[[Om]]'' or a ''srivasta'', and various scholars consider ''siddham'' in inscriptions to be equivalent to these signs.&lt;ref name="Salomon1998p67"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lore Sander (1986), ''Om or Siddham–Remarks on Openings of Buddhist Manuscripts and Inscriptions from Gilgit and Central Asia'', in Deyadharma: Studies in Memory of Dr. DC Sircar, pages 251-261&lt;/ref&gt;

This word, written out in characters (such as those shown in the Siddham logo) or represented by a symbol, often stands at the beginning of inscriptions in Indic languages.&lt;ref name="Salomon1998p67"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Salomon|title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYrG07qQDxkC&amp;pg=PA67 |year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-535666-3|pages=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Siddham'' is also used as a short name for the Indian script known as [[Siddhaṃ_script|siddhamātṛkā]].

==Technical background==
The records in Siddham have been prepared in [[EpiDoc]], a tool for structured [[markup language|markup]] of [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] documents in [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]] [[XML]]. 

==Numbering system==
Within Siddham, each item is listed firstly as an object -- such as a pillar, sculpture, copper-plate, stone slab and so forth. Each object may carry one or more inscriptions, thus each inscription has been assigned a separate Siddham number. A good example is the [[Allahabad pillar]] -- a single object -- which carries many inscriptions, among them those of Aśoka, [[Samudragupta]] and Jahāngīr.&lt;ref&gt;Falk, Harry. ''Aśokan Sites and Artefacts: A Source-Book with Bibliography''. Mainz am Rhein: Ph. von Zabern, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription of Samdragupta appears in Siddham as IN00001.&lt;ref&gt;See: http://siddham.uk/object/ob00001&lt;/ref&gt; All material generated for SIDDHAṂ is archived in [[Zenodo]].

The further example illustrated here is from [[Salihundam]], Gara Mandal, Srikakulam district, [[Andhra Pradesh]], India, a Buddhist place located approximately at 18°20'7"N 84°2'28"E. At this site, a series of five votive inscriptions are engraved on the semi-circular threshold of a ruined shrine. In Siddham, the semi-circular stone will carry an object number and each votive record an independent inscription number. The photograph of the inscriptions is archived as Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.557032.

[[File:Erc-logo.jpg|thumb|]]
==Translations==
Translations of inscription texts into western languages appear separately in the community called '''SIDDHAṂ traductions''' in [[Zenodo]]. Each translation is numbered according to the inscription number assigned in Siddham.

==Mapping==
Epigraphic documentation involves mapping sites of key dynasties and their inscriptions, especially land-charters recording gifts of land. The mapping undertaken to date can be explored through these links:

In mathematical or [[statistical model|statistical mode]]ling a '''threshold model''' is any model where a threshold value, or set of threshold values, is used to distinguish ranges of values where the behaviour predicted by the model varies in some important way. A particularly important instance arises in toxicology, where the model for the effect of a drug may be that there is zero effect for a dose below a critical or threshold value, while an effect of some significance exists above that value.&lt;ref name=Dodge&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-850994-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain types of regression model may include threshold effects.&lt;ref name=Dodge/&gt;

== Collective Behavior ==
Threshold models are often used to model the behavior of groups, ranging from social insects to animal herds to human society.

Classic threshold models were developed by Schelling, Axelrod, and [[Mark Granovetter|Granovetter]] to model [[collective behavior]]. Schelling attempted to model the dynamics of segregation  motivated by individual interactions in America (Schelling, 1971) by constructing two simulation models. Schelling demonstrated that “there is no simple correspondence of individual incentive to collective results,” and that the dynamics of movement influenced patterns of segregation. In doing so Schelling highlighted the significance of “a general theory of ‘tipping’”.

Mark Granovetter, following Schelling, proposed the threshold model (Granovetter &amp; Soong, 1983, 1986, 1988), which assumes that individuals’ behavior depends on the number of other individuals already engaging in that behavior (both Schelling and Granovetter classify their term of “threshold” as behavioral threshold.). He used the threshold model to explain the riot, residential segregation, and the spiral of silence. In the spirit of Granovetter’s threshold model, the “threshold” is “the number or proportion of others who must make one decision before a given actor does so”. 
It is necessary to emphasize the determinants of threshold. Different individuals have different thresholds. Individuals' thresholds may be influenced by many factors: social economic status, education, age, personality, etc. Further, Granovetter relates “threshold” with utility one gets from participating in collective behavior or not, using the utility function, each individual will calculate his or her cost and benefit from undertaking an action. And situation may change the cost and benefit of the behavior, so threshold is situation-specific.
The distribution of the thresholds determines the outcome of the aggregate behavior (for example, public opinion).

==Segmented Regression analysis==

The models used in [[segmented regression analysis]] are threshold models.

==Fractals==

Certain deterministic recursive multivariate models which include threshold effects have been shown to produce [[fractal]] effects.&lt;ref name=Tong&gt;Tong, H. (1990) ''Non-linear Time Series: A Dynamical System Approach'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-852224-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time series analysis==

Several classes of [[nonlinear]] [[autoregressive]] models formulated for [[time series]] applications have been threshold models.&lt;ref name=Tong/&gt;

==Toxicology==
A threshold model used in [[toxicology]] posits that anything above a certain dose of a [[toxin]] is dangerous, and anything below it safe. This model is usually applied to non-[[carcinogen]]ic health hazards.

Edward J. Calabrese and Linda A. Baldwin wrote:

:The threshold dose-response model is widely viewed as the most dominant model in toxicology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Calabrese | first1 = E.J. | last2 = Baldwin | first2 = L.A. | year = 2003 | title = The Hormetic Dose-Response Model Is More Common than the Threshold Model in Toxicology | url = http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/71/2/246 | journal = [[Toxicological Sciences]] | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 246–250 | doi=10.1093/toxsci/71.2.246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative type of model in toxicology is the [[linear no-threshold model]] (LNT), while [[hormesis]] correspond to the existence of opposite effects at low vs. high dose, which usually gives a U- or inverted U-shaped dose response curve.

== Liability threshold model ==

The '''liability-threshold model''' is a threshold model of categorical (usually binary) outcomes in which a large number of variables are summed to yield an overall 'liability' score; the observed outcome is determined by whether the [[latent variable|latent]] score is smaller or larger than the threshold. The liability-threshold model is frequently employed in medicine and genetics to model risk factors contributing to disease.

In a genetic context, the variables are all the genes and different environmental conditions, which protect against or increase the risk of a disease, and the threshold ''z'' is the biological limit past which disease develops. The threshold can be estimated from population prevalence of the disease (which is usually low). Because the threshold is defined relative to the population &amp; environment, the liability score is generally considered as a N(0, 1) [[Normal distribution|normally distributed]] [[random variable]].

Early genetics models were developed to deal with very rare genetic diseases by treating them as [[Mendelian disease]]s caused by 1 or 2 genes: the presence or absence of the gene corresponds to the presence or absence of the disease, and the occurrence of the disease will follow predictable patterns within families. Continuous traits like height or intelligence could be modeled as [[normal distribution]]s, influenced by a large number of genes, and the heritability and effects of selection easily analyzed. Some diseases, like alcoholism, epilepsy, or [[Schizophrenia#Genetic|schizophrenia]], cannot be Mendelian diseases because they are common; do not appear in Mendelian ratios; respond slowly to selection against them; often occur in families with no prior history of that disease; however, relatives and adoptees of someone with that disease are far more likely (but not certain) to develop it, indicating a strong genetic component. The liability threshold model was developed to deal with these non-Mendelian binary cases; the model proposes that there is a continuous normally-distributed trait expressing risk polygenically influenced by many genes, which all individuals above a certain value develop the disease and all below it do not.

The first threshold models in genetics were introduced by [[Sewall Wright]], examining the propensity of [[guinea pig]] strains to have an extra hind toe, a phenomenon which could not be explained as a dominant or recessive gene, or continuous "blinding inheritance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1208511/pdf/506.pdf | pmc=1208511 | pmid=17246735 | volume=19 | title=An Analysis of Variability in Number of Digits in an Inbred Strain of Guinea Pigs | journal=Genetics | pages=506–36 | last1 = Wright | first1 = S | year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1208512/pdf/537.pdf | pmc=1208512 | pmid=17246736 | volume=19 | title=The Results of Crosses between Inbred Strains of Guinea Pigs, Differing in Number of Digits | journal=Genetics | pages=537–51 | last1 = Wright | first1 = S | year=1934b}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern liability-threshold model was introduced into human research by geneticist [[Douglas Scott Falconer]] in his textbook&lt;ref&gt;ch18, "Threshold characters", [https://archive.org/details/introductiontoq00falc ''Introduction to Quantitative Genetics''], Falconer 1960&lt;/ref&gt; and two papers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/182368464/1965-falconer.pdf "The inheritance of liability to certain diseases, estimated from the incidence among relatives"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815214451/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/182368464/1965-falconer.pdf |date=2016-08-15 }}, Falconer 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/182368464/1967-falconer.pdf "The inheritance of liability to diseases with variable age of onset, with particular reference to diabetes mellitus"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815203446/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/182368464/1967-falconer.pdf |date=2016-08-15 }}, Falconer 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Falconer had been asked about the topic of modeling 'threshold characters' by [[Cyril Clarke]] who had [[diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetics.org/content/167/4/1529 "D. S. Falconer and ''Introduction to Quantitative Genetics''"], Hill &amp; Mackay 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

An early application of liability-threshold models was to schizophrenia by [[Irving Gottesman]] &amp; James Shields, finding substantial heritability &amp; little shared-environment influence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC335617/pdf/pnas00677-0218.pdf | pmc=335617 | pmid=5231600 | volume=58 | title=A polygenic theory of schizophrenia | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | pages=199–205 | last1 = Gottesman | first1 = II | last2 = Shields | first2 = J | doi=10.1073/pnas.58.1.199 | year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; and undermining the "cold mother" theory of schizophrenia.

'''Wallball''' is a type of school yard game similar to [[butts up]], aces-kings-queens, [[Chinese handball]], [[Welsh handball|Pêl-Law (Welsh handball)]] and [[American handball]] (American handball is sometimes actually referred to as wallball). Kenny Mott is the founding father of wallball. The sport was played by a few schools in the Brandon Manitoba, then began gaining much popularity, resulting in a popular worldwide sport. Wallball is now played globally with the international federation, Wall Ball International, promoting the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wall Ball International Webpage|url=http://wallball.co/|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game requires the ball to be hit to the floor before hitting the wall, but in other respects is similar to squash. It can be played as a singles, doubles or elimination game.

Wallball is derived from many New York City street games played by young people, often involving the [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] hi-bounce balls created in 1949.

==Objective==
The objective of wallball is to eliminate all other players in order to be the last player standing, or to be the starter of the game continuously (if the game is endless).

== Wallball ==
The aim of the game is to hit the ball against a wall. If the person hits the wall and the ball bounces out of play the person next in line loses a life. People first decide who serves. This procedure varies, but is usually the winner of the previous game or the person who got the ball (if that would be the first game), or the new person coming in. The server first hits the ball forward and down so that it hits the ground and bounces up to hit the wall. (If the server is a good sport, an easy ball is started with to get the game going.) If it bounces on the ground more than once or if it doesn't bounce on the ground before it hits the wall, it is considered out. Then, after hitting the ball, the ball would bounce back, and the next person would do the same thing. If the ball bounces more than once before the second player hits it the second person is out, but hitting the ball before it bounces is allowed after the first person hits the ball. If the ball bounces out of bounds (the boundaries are usually determined by the orange lines surrounding the field) at any time, it is considered out, and if it hits the orange line, it is sometimes considered in, sometimes considered out, and sometimes considered a "liney" or "liner" in which the game stops and the person who made the liney serves again. The goal is to get the person behind you out by hitting it with the right force and in the right direction. There are sometimes rules called "first serves", in which the server doesn't get out until the third time the server gets out.

There are many variations to the rules, but the rules above are the classic ones. Babies, in which the ball on the second bounce is smaller than the closest interior orange line to the wall (there are two orange lines; one is about three-four feet from the wall, and the other one is about two-thirds of the court away from the wall) and sliceys (or skimmers), where the ball goes at an extremely high speed and extremely low height, are very common varying things (in or out).

There are four main types of wallball: regular, teams, line-up, and random.

* Regular is where the players line up outside of the court on a bench (which is usually present) or standing if there is no bench, and two players enter the court. They play, and the losing player goes to the end of the line, and the next person comes up.
* Teams is the same as regular, except that there are four (or more, but even) players that come up (grouped in equal teams).
* Line-up is where all the players line up in a line that is either determined by the winning person or in "random order", where the players pick the order, and they play in order (the server goes after the last person).
* Random is where all the players are scattered around the court, the server serves, and a random person (whoever wants to hit the ball) comes up and hits the ball. In random, when nobody hits the ball, players determine who is out by either considering it a re-do (the server or another person serves again), "flinching" (the person who reacts to the ball in a fashion that looks like the player is going to hit the ball), nearest person (the closest person to the ball is out), or a combination of nearest person and flinching (if somebody flinches, the flinching person is out; if nobody flinches, the nearest person is out).

In line-up or random, the winner of each game usually decides the rules and game style of the next game (usually with the classic rules, but the winner usually has the right to change them, though if enough people disagree, the idea is usually not used), and in regular or teams, the first person to beat the whole line gets to determine the rules and game style of the next game. If playing with a soccer ball/football, they have to hit it wherever it lies, if against.Players stand a few feet away from the wall. They may only get three outs (no outs if you want the game to be endless). A player serves the ball by throwing directly at the wall. The ball then should return to another player. It is not an out if you get the ball again but is considered unfair if you intended to get the ball back (however, if the ball returns to you three times, it is formally known as a "tea party", and you are out). If the ball bounces first, it is an out. If you drop the ball or the ball hits you, you will have to get to the wall before someone else throws the ball and hits the wall or you will get an out. If you get the ball that is out-of-bounds, players are permitted to shout "challenge!" During challenges, you have to throw the ball from the same place where you picked up the ball. You may only take tiny steps then throw or move backwards. If you move anywhere else, you will get an out. These alternative rules are more common in the Midwest and [[Canada]]. In Australia however the rules are slightly different where there are rules for spiking. Spiking is when the ball hits another player on the full without bouncing and the player which is hit goes on the wall. Some versions are played using two walls adjacent to each other, called "cube ball" where the same rules apply except two walls are used instead of one. Another, called "Aceball", is similar to wallball except that the ball is hit on the wall without a bounce, then allowed to bounce once before a returning hit is required from the other player. Aceball can be played by kicking it as well, though it is no where near as prominent.

==Wallball Rules==

*'''Chicken pox''':this is an an out because it is too overpowerd this happens when you make a fist with both hands.
*'''Angle''': Someone hits the ball in such a way that leads the ball out of the playing area. This is especially applied in an outdoor location.
*'''Baby''': A small, hard to get shot (ball must clear two feet from the bottom of the wall).
*'''Bad Serve''': An incorrect serve which leads to the re-serving of the ball.
*'''Black Magic''': Placing one's hands in front of the ball and maybe pretending to hit it,  once (faking the other person out or to get a reaction out of them) but not hitting it, when it is the opponent's turn
*'''Bus stop''': When the ball is returned to a player, the player yells "Bus stop!" and they bounce the ball once and then hit it.
*'''Challenge''': When a player without the ball shouts challenge, the player with the ball must throw the ball to the wall from where he/she is standing.
*'''Crossy''': Similar to an angle, a crossy is a shot played across the wall to make the opposition run for the ball (sometimes called cross country).
*'''Double Bounce''': Ball bounces more than once before hitting the wall, leading to elimination.
*'''Drop Shot''': Hitting the ball with an angle that makes the ball skim the wall (sometimes called waterfall). (Though "Waterfall" may also refer to a ball that hits so high/straight/parallel to the wall that it skims the wall twice before coming down.)
*'''High Wire''': Also known as a slam, a big hit.
*'''Holdy''': Sometimes simply referred to as a "hold", when someone holds on to the ball rather than slapping/hitting it.
*'''(Hyper) Skimmer''': a low, fast-moving ball, a hyper, or super, skimmer goes exceedingly fast and low, and can only be performed by talented players (may be known as something else, like slicey, or snake) Sometimes, "Grounder", or "Roller" may be call to force a redo.
*'''Interference''': When the ball hits an outside object or hits a player directly after being hit by another player (before hitting the wall). Usually, the judge (first person in the waiting line) serves on an interference, and calls which player to hit it. Sometimes, if the judge is hit, the judge can get you out. This term may be shortened simply as an ''inter''.
*'''Ogden''': When the ball hits the palm of the hand, and does not have enough power to reach the wall.
*'''Out of Bounds''': When the ball goes out of the intended, pre-determined playing surface.
*'''Overdog''': Jumping over the ball instead of hitting it.
*'''Pop''': "Pop" or "Poppy" (as in "no poppies"): shot where the ball hits the wall where it meets the ground, and sort of "pops" out of the corner, usually loudly if using a large red rubber ball (i.e. 4 square ball)—depends on rules agreed before the game but usually illegal (similar to babies) and thus results in the committing player being out.
*'''Rainbow''': Player can call "Rainbow" and must go under the ball without touching the ball successfully, and another player has to hit the ball (sometimes called underdogs or watermelons).
*'''Review''': In some games, players can challenge, or ask for a review that they are not out for whatever reason. If they lose the challenge, they cannot challenge anymore.
*'''Shotgun''': A hard hit that directly hits the wall, rather than bouncing once; typically followed by the elimination of the player who shot that ball (may be known as something else, such as ''bullet'', ''jet'', and ''direct'').
*'''Skid''': The ball returns in a faster pace due to wet contact or the ball's particular rotation.
*'''Slicey''': A player swipes their hand under the ball, without touching the ball, and say "Slicey!" The opponent now has to hit the ball.
*'''Steph Curry''': When the player makes a hoop with their arms and lets the ball pass through without hitting their arms. Player must call out "Steph Curry!"  {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}
*'''Time Out''': Stopping the game right in the middle of it (player must call Time in to play again).
*'''Top Hat''': Player hits the ball on top and says Top Hat, making the ball bounce straight down. The other player must hit the ball before it bounces twice and the ball must hit the ground before it hits the wall.
*'''Trap bounce''': Where the ball traps after bouncing once. It typically leads to an elimination or judging.
*'''Traps''': Where the ball hits directly on the join between the wall and ground. This can be played on or replayed and is also known as ''Ace'', "Pops", "Pocket", "Gutter", "Gutter-ball", or "Poppy's".
*'''Troll time''': In the alternate rules when an opposing player throws the ball to the wall a long way away, a player deflects the ball down to the ground touches the wall, then re-throws the ball to the wall all before the opponent has the opportunity to get back to the wall.
*'''Type Writer''': Hitting the ball at the wall, then continually hitting the ball without it touching the floor until the hitter sees fit to let the ball rotate to the next player by hitting the ball against the wall one last time with force. Type Writer should not exceed 5 seconds.
