{{Politics of Iceland}}
The '''Icelandic NATO riot''' of 30 March 1949 was prompted by the decision of [[Alþingi]], the Icelandic parliament, to join the newly formed [[NATO]], thereby involving Iceland directly in the [[Cold War]], opposing the [[Soviet Union]] and re-militarizing the country. 

The protesters first convened behind a school in the centre of [[Reykjavík]] and then marched on [[Austurvöllur]], a small park in front of the parliament building, where a throng of people had already arrived positioning themselves between the parliament and the rioters, intending to defend it.

At first the demonstrators were calm, but when a leading member of the [[People's Unity Party – Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] announced over a loudspeaker that the leader of his party was held hostage inside the Parliament building, things became violent. 

Rocks were tossed at the building, some breaking the windows and one narrowly missing the head of the Parliamentary president, until the [[Reykjavík]] [[Icelandic Police|police]] force, aided by volunteers from the [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] intervened, beating rioters down and eventually launching [[tear gas]] grenades at the rioters.

No official estimate exists of the number of participants, but photographic evidence clearly shows that thousands of people were present.

== Aftermath ==
[[File:Policemen in gas masks guard Austurvöllur after dispersing the crowd with tear gas..jpg|thumb|left|Policemen in gas masks guard [[Austurvöllur]] after dispersing the crowd with tear gas]]
The details of this event have largely been obscured by opposing opinions and lack of neutrality in discussion. Despite violent opposition, Iceland's membership in NATO was confirmed. 

After the event, protests by anti-NATO activists were commonplace. The left parties in 1950s and 1960s parliamentary elections promised to put an end to the bilateral U.S.-Icelandic Defence Agreement, but dropped these promises after becoming part of the ruling coalitions.&lt;ref name="SSI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/index.cfm/articles/Icelands-Defense-and-Security-Relations-1940-2011/2011/8/18 |author=Einar Benediktsson. |title=At Crossroads: Iceland's Defense and Security Relations, 1940-2011 |publisher=[[Strategic Studies Institute]] |date=August 18, 2011 |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan "Iceland out of NATO and the Army out!" ("''Ísland úr NATO og herinn burt!''") became a part of Icelandic culture. In 1974, the government proposed closing down the Keflavik base, but a petition campaign gathered a quarter of the population's signatures. The government fell out of power, and it was replaced by a decidedly pro-NATO government.&lt;ref name="Markham 1982"&gt;{{cite news | last=Markham | first=James M. | title=Iceland's elves are enlisted in anti-NATO effort | work=New York Times | date=1982-03-30 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/30/world/iceland-s-elves-are-enlisted-in-anti-nato-effort.html | access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 30, 2006, the [[US Navy]] unilaterally withdrew the last of its military force from [[Keflavík International Airport|Keflavík airport]].&lt;ref name="SSI" /&gt;

The '''6 February 1934 crisis''' was  an [[anti-parliamentarist]] street demonstration in Paris organized by multiple [[far-right league]]s that culminated in a riot on the [[Place de la Concorde]], near the seat of the [[French National Assembly]]. The police shot and killed 15 demonstrators. It was one of the major political crises during the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] (1870–1940).&lt;ref&gt;Chris Millington, "Political Violence in Interwar France." ''History Compass'' 10.3 (2012): 246-259.&lt;/ref&gt; Frenchmen on the left feared it was an attempt to organize a [[fascism|fascist]] ''[[coup d'état]]''. According to historian Joel Colton, "The consensus among scholars is that there was no concerted or unified design to seize power and that the leagues lacked the coherence, unity, or leadership to accomplish such an end."&lt;ref&gt;Joel Colton, "Politics and economics in the 1930s" in ''From the Ancien Regime to the Popular Front,'' ed. Charles K. Warner (1969), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the actions of that day, several [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organisations were created, such as the ''[[Comité de vigilance des intellectuels antifascistes]]'', in an attempt to thwart the rise of fascism in France. After [[World War II]], several historians, among them [[:fr:Serge Bernstein|Serge Bernstein]], argued, while some leagues had been indisputably pushing for a ''coup'', [[François de La Rocque]] had, in fact, turned in a liberal direction, toward a respect for constitutional order. However, if the lack of coordination among the fascist leagues undermined the idea of a fascist conspiracy, the fascist actions on 6 February were an uncoordinated but violent attempt to overthrow the ''[[Cartel des gauches]]'' government [[French legislative election, 1932|elected in 1932]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Jenkins,  "The six fevrier 1934 and the ‘Survival’ of the French Republic." ''French history'' 20.3 (2006): 333-351.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Édouard Daladier]], who was [[List of prime ministers of France|president of the national Council]], replaced [[Camille Chautemps]] on 27 January 1934 because of accusations of corruption (including the [[Stavisky Affair]]).  Daladier, who had been a popular figure, was nonetheless forced to resign on 7 February. He was replaced by the conservative [[Gaston Doumergue]] as head of the government; this was the first time during the tenure of the Third Republic a government fell because of pressures from the street.

==The 1930s crisis and the Stavisky affair==
[[France in the twentieth century#France in the 1920 and 1930s|France]] was affected in 1931, somewhat later than other Western countries, by the [[Great Depression in France|1929 Great Depression]], which had been triggered by the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] ("Black Thursday"). The economic and social crisis particularly affected the middle classes, traditional supporters of the Republic (in particular of the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party]]). Parliamentary instability followed, with five governments between May 1932 and January 1934, which fueled the anti-parliamentarist movement.&lt;ref&gt;William D. Irvine, . ''French Conservatism in Crisis: The Republican Federation of France in the 1930s'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter took advantage also of a succession of [[political scandal|political and financial scandals]], such as the [[Marthe Hanau| Marthe Hanau Affair]] (she had used her political supporters to attract, with her newspaper ''La Gazette du [[Franc]]'', the savings of the ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]''); the Oustric Affair (the criminal bankruptcy of banker [[Albert Oustric]] provoked the fall of [[André Tardieu]]'s government in 1930, because of the involvement of his Minister of Justice in it); and, finally, the immediate cause of the 6 February 1934 demonstrations, the [[Stavisky Affair]].

This new scandal, which involved [[Bayonne]]'s ''Crédit municipal'' bank, exploded in December 1933. The embezzler [[Alexandre Stavisky]], known as ''le beau Sasha'' ("the handsome Sasha") was linked to several Radical deputies, including a minister of [[Camille Chautemps]]'s government. The press later revealed that Stavisky had benefited from a 19-month postponement of his trial because the public prosecutor was Chautemps' brother-in-law. On 8 January 1934, Alexandre Stavisky was found dead. According to the police report, he had committed suicide, a conclusion that provoked general disbelief. According to the right wing, Chautemps had had him assassinated to keep him from revealing any secrets. The press then started a political campaign against alleged governmental corruption, while the far right demonstrated. At the end of the month, after the revelation of yet another scandal, Chautemps resigned. [[Édouard Daladier]], another member of the Radical Party, succeeded him on 27 January 1934.

Since 9 January, thirteen demonstrations had already taken place in Paris. While the right wing was trying to use the affair to replace the left-wing majority elected during the 1932 elections, the far right took advantage of its traditional themes: [[antisemitism]], [[xenophobia]] (Stavisky was a [[naturalization|naturalized]] Ukrainian Jew), hostility toward [[Freemasonry]] (Camille Chautemps was a Masonic dignitary), and anti-parliamentarism.  As historian Serge Bernstein emphasized, the Stavisky Affair was exceptional neither in its seriousness nor in the personalities put on trial, but in the right wing's will to use the opportunity to make a left-wing government resign. In this aim, it could take advantage of the fact that the radical socialists did not have an absolute majority in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] and thus the government was weak.

However, it was the dismissal of the [[Prefecture of Police|police prefect]] [[Jean Chiappe]] that ultimately provoked the massive demonstrations of 6 February. Chiappe, who was openly right-wing, was very soft on far-right activism, which essentially took place in the streets (demonstrations, riots, attacks against the few left-wing students in the [[Quartier Latin]] by the monarchist ''[[Camelots du Roy]]'', the youth organization of the ''[[Action Française]]'', etc.). According to the left wing, Chiappe's dismissal was due to his involvement in the Stavisky Affair while the right wing denounced the result of negotiations with the Radicals: the departure of Chiappe would have been exchanged for support for Daladier's new government.

== The night of 6 February 1934 ==

===Forces present===
Right-wing anti-parliamentary leagues had been the main activists during the January 1934 demonstrations. Although these leagues were not a new phenomenon (the old ''[[Ligue des Patriotes]]'' ("Patriot League") had been founded by [[Paul Déroulède]] in 1882), they played an important role following World War I, in particular when the left wing was in power, as it had been since the 1932 legislative elections.&lt;ref&gt;William D. Irvine, ''French Conservatism in Crisis: The Republican Federation of France in the 1930s'' (1979) pp 98-126.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Action Française]]''. Among the most important right-wing leagues present on 6 February, the oldest one was the royalist ''Action Française''. Founded in 1905 by [[Charles Maurras]], it was composed of 60,000 members eager to overturn ''la gueuse'', as they called the Republic, in order to restore the [[House of Capet|Capetian]] monarchy (which had been overthrown during the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|1848 Revolution]]), but that the "[[legitimist]]" movement adamantly opposed. It was not until after World War II and the defeat of the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] that the legitimist right-wing movement, one of the three French right-wing traditions analyzed by historian [[René Rémond]], finally became a really marginal grouping. The ''Action Française'' had as its youth group the ''[[Camelots du Roy]]'', militants very active in the ''Quartier Latin'' against left-wing students (at that time, the right-wing had a majority in the students' movement).
*The ''[[Jeunesses Patriotes]]'' ("Patriot Youth") had been founded by [[Pierre Taittinger]], deputy of Paris, in 1924. With 90,000 members, including 1,500 "elites" members, it claimed the legacy of the ''[[Ligue des Patriotes]]''. The ''Jeunesses Patriotes'' had close link with right-wing politicians, and boasted several municipal councillors of the capital in their ranks.
*''[[Solidarité Française]]'' ("French Solidarity"), founded in 1933 by wealthy perfume producer [[François Coty]], had no precise political aims and few members.
*''[[Francisme]]'' and others. [[Marcel Bucard]]'s ''Francisme'' had adopted all the elements of the [[fascism|fascist]] ideology, while the ''[[Fédération des contribuables]]'' ("Taxpayers federation") shared its political aims with the other leagues.
*The ''[[Croix-de-feu]]''. The ''Croix-de-feu'' had been created in 1926 as a World War I veterans association. The most important league by membership numbers, it had extended its recruitment in 1931 to other categories of the population under [[François de la Rocque|Colonel de la Rocque]]'s leadership. Like the other leagues, they also had "combat" and "self-defense" groups, called "''dispos''". Although many on the left wing accused it of having become a fascist movement, especially after the crisis, historians state that François de la Rocque's reluctance to participate in a coup d'état was a key reason for the failure of the riots to overthrow the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;William D. Irvine, "Fascism in France and the Strange Case of the Croix de Feu." ''Journal of Modern History'' 63.2 (1991): 271-295. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2938485 online]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Veterans' associations''. The veterans' associations which had taken part in the January demonstrations also took to the streets on 6 February. The most important, the ''[[Union nationale des combattants]]'' (UNC), directed by a Parisian municipal counsellor whose ideas were close to the right wing, counted 900,000 members. And showing the complexity of the situation and the general exasperation of the population, the [[Association républicaine des anciens combattants]] (ARAC), the unofficial [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) veterans' association, also called for its troops to demonstrate on 6 February, though with clearly different aims.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Millington, "February 6, 1934: The Veterans' Riot." ''French Historical Studies'' 33.4 (2010): 545-572.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The riots===

On the night of 6 February, the leagues, which had gathered in different places in Paris, all converged on [[Place de la Concorde]], located in front of the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]], but on the other side of the [[Seine]] river. The police and guards managed to defend the strategic bridge of the Concorde, despite being the target of all sorts of projectiles. Some rioters were armed, and the police fired on the crowd. Disturbances lasted until 2:30 AM. 16 people were killed and 2,000 injured, most of them members of the ''Action Française''.

Far-right organisations had the most important role in the riots; most of the UNC veterans avoided the Place de la Concorde, creating some incidents near the [[Elysée palace]], the president's residence. However, Communists belonging to the rival left-wing veterans' organization ARAC may have been involved; one public notice afterward attacked the governing centre-left coalition (known as the ''[[Cartel des gauches]]''). The Cartel had the unarmed veterans who shouted "Down with the robbers, long live France!" killed.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

The American journalist [[John Gunther]] wrote in 1940 that the ''Croix-de-feu'' "could easily have captured the Chamber of Deputies. But [de la Rocque] held his men back. 'France wasn't ready,' he explained". It was possible, Gunther said, that "like Hitler, he hopes to gain power by legal means."&lt;ref name="gunther1940"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n227/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers | author=Gunther, John | year=1940 | pages=205-206}}&lt;/ref&gt; While on the right side of the Seine (north, on the Place de la Concorde), the policemen's charges contained the rioters with difficulty, the ''Croix-de-feu'' had chosen to demonstrate in the south. The [[Palais Bourbon]], seat of the National Assembly, is much more difficult to defend on this side, but the ''Croix-de-feu'' limited themselves to surrounding the building without any major incident before dispersing. Because of this attitude, they earned the pejorative nickname of ''Froides Queues'' in the far-right press. Contrary to the other leagues which were intent on overthrowing the Republic, it thus seemed that Colonel de la Rocque finally decided to respect the constitutional legality.

In the National Assembly, the right wing attempted to take advantage of the riots to push the ''Cartel des gauches'' government to resign. The left wing, however, rallied around president of the Council [[Édouard Daladier]]. The session was ended after blows were exchanged between left and right-wing deputies.

==Consequences of the riots==

===Daladier's resignation and the formation of a National Union government===
During the night, president of the Council Édouard Daladier took the first measures to obtain the re-establishment of public order. He did not exclude the possibility of declaring a [[state of emergency]], although he finally decided against it. However, the next day the judiciary and the police resisted his directives. Moreover, most of his ministers and his party withdrew their support. Thus, Daladier finally chose to resign. This was the first time during the Third Republic that a government had to resign because of pressure from the streets.

The crisis was finally resolved with the formation of a new government under the direction of former president of the Republic (1924–31) [[Gaston Doumergue]], a conservative whom the leagues seemed to accept. Qualified as a "National Union government", it included the most important figures of the parliamentary right wing, among them [[André Tardieu]], [[Louis Barthou]], and [[Louis Marin (politician)|Louis Marin]], although several Radical-Socialists and [[Philippe Pétain]], who was named Minister of War, were also part of it. Pétain would later be the leader of the collaborationist [[Vichy regime]] during World War II.

===Toward the union of the left wing===
{{Further|History of the Left in France}}
Following 6 February, the left wing was convinced that a fascist conspiracy had taken place, and that it had been temporarily blocked. The importance of the anti-parliamentarist activity of far-right leagues was undeniable. Some of them, such as the ''[[Francisque]]'', had copied all of their characteristics from the Italian ''[[Fascio]]'' leagues which had [[March on Rome|marched on Rome]] in 1922, thus leading to the imposition of the [[Italian fascism|fascist regime]]. Although historian Serge Bernstein has showed that [[Colonel de la Rocque]] had probably been convinced of the necessity of respecting constitutional legality, this was not true of all members of his ''[[Croix-de-feu]]'' movement, which also shared, at least superficially, some characteristics of the fascist leagues, in particular their [[militarism]] and fascination for parades.

On 9 February 1934, a socialist and communist counter-demonstration took place while Daladier was being replaced by conservative Gaston Doumergue. Nine people were killed during incidents with the police forces. On 12 February the [[Confédération générale du travail|CGT trade union]] (socialist and reformist at the time) and the [[Confédération générale du travail unitaire|CGTU]] (communist) decided to call for a one-day [[general strike]], while the [[Section française de l'Internationale ouvrière|SFIO socialist party]] and the [[French Communist Party|communist party]] decided to call for a separate demonstration. However, at the initiative of the popular base of these movements, the demonstrations finally united themselves into one. Thus, this day marked a first tentative union between the socialists and the communists. It had at its core the [[anti-fascism]] shared by both Marxist parties; a union had been opposed since the 1920 [[Tours Congress]] split, but this new rapprochement led to the 1936 [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] (consisting of radicals and socialists and supported without participation in the government by the Communist party). This antifascist union was in line with [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s directives to the [[Comintern]], which had asked the European communist parties to ally with other left-wing parties, including [[social-democrats]] and socialists, in order to block the contagion of fascist and [[anticommunism|anti-communist]] regimes in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Jackson. ''A The Popular Front in France: Defending Democracy, 1934-38'' (1988) pp 17-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, several anti-fascist organizations were created in the wake of the riots, such as the ''[[Comité de vigilance des intellectuels antifascistes]]'' (Watchfulness Committee of Antifascist Intellectuals, created in March 1934) which included philosopher [[Émile Chartier|Alain]], ethnologist [[Paul Rivet]] and physicist [[Paul Langevin]]. The [[Anarchism in France|anarchist movement]] also took part in many antifascist actions.

===The right wing's radicalization===
Following the crisis, the parliamentary right also began to get closer to the [[counter-revolutionary]] far right. Several of its leaders would lose all trust in parliamentary institutions. [[Daniel Halévy]], a French historian of Jewish descent, publicly declared that following 6 February 1934 he was now a "man of the extreme right". Although he personally abhorred Italian fascism or German national socialism, he went on to support the Pétain regime in Vichy.&lt;ref&gt;See, inter alia, Mark Hulliung ''Citizens and citoyens: republicans and liberals in America and France'' (2002) at p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; The radicalization of the right wing would accelerate after the election of the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] in 1936 and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–39).

In the view of the far right, 6 February represented a failed opportunity to overthrow the Republic (''la gueuse''), which only presented itself again in 1940 following the ''étrange défaite'' ([[Marc Bloch]]) or "divine surprise" ([[Charles Maurras]]), that is the 1940 defeat during the [[Battle of France]] against Germany. This deception prompted several far-right members to radicalize themselves, turning toward fascism, [[Nazism|national-socialism]] or the wartime Vichy regime.

Despite the fears of the left wing, the 6 February crisis was not a fascist conspiracy. The far-right leagues were not united enough and most of them lacked any specific objectives. However, their violent methods, their paramilitary appearances, their cult of leadership, etc., explained why they have often been associated with fascism. Beyond these appearances, however, and their will to see the parliamentary regime replaced by an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime, historians [[René Rémond]] and Serge Bernstein do not consider that they had a real fascist project. Opposing this view, other historians, such as [[Michel Dobry]] or [[Zeev Sternhell]], considered them as being fully fascist leagues. [[Brian Jenkins (academic)|Brian Jenkins]] claimed it was pointless to look for a fascist essence in France and preferred to make comparisons which led, according to him, to a clear convergence between Italian fascism and the majority of the French leagues, in particular the ''[[Action Française]]'' (in other words, Jenkins considers fascism an Italian historic phenomenon, and though a fascist-like movement existed in France, it should not be called "fascist" as that name should be reserved for [[Benito Mussolini]]'s movement).&lt;ref&gt;Brian Jenkins, "The six fevrier 1934 and the ‘Survival’of the French Republic."

'''Active citizenship''' refers to a [[philosophy]] espoused by organizations and educational institutions which advocates that members of [[Charitable organization|charitable organizations]], companies or [[nation-state]]s have certain roles and responsibilities to [[society]] and the [[Natural environment|environment]], although those members may not have specific governing roles.

== Description ==

Active citizenship can be seen as an articulation of the debate over [[rights]] versus [[moral responsibility|responsibilities]]. If a body gives rights to the people under its remit, then those same people might have certain responsibilities to uphold. This would be most obvious at a [[country]] or nation-state level, but could also be of wider scope, such as the Internet ([[Netizen]]) or Earth ([[global citizenship]]). The implication is that an active citizen is one who fulfils both their rights and responsibilities in a balanced way.

A problem with this concept is that although rights are often written down as part of the law, responsibilities are not as well defined, and there may be disagreements amongst the citizens as to what the responsibilities are. For example, in the [[UK|United Kingdom]], citizens have the right to free health care, but [[voting]] in [[elections]] is not compulsory, even though many people would define this as a responsibility.

Writing a clear definition of responsibilities for an active citizen is much more problematic than writing a list of rights. For example, although voting might be considered a basic responsibility by many people, there are some who through [[disability]] or other issues are not able to [[Participation (decision making)|participate]] fully in the voting process.

An active citizen is someone who takes a role in the community; the term has been identified with volunteering by writers such as Jonathan Tisch, who wrote in the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' in 2010 advocating that busy Americans should try to help others, particularly by offering high-level professional expertise in such areas as [[banking]], [[education]], [[engineering]], and [[technology]] to help the less fortunate.&lt;ref name=twsJun16xxx&gt;{{cite news

 |title= Active Citizenship: A New Approach to Volunteering
 |publisher= ''Huffington Post''
 |quote= I introduced Citizen You, the movement I've spearheaded to encourage Americans to utilize their professional skills to help others. This new kind of volunteering, which has come to be known as "active citizenship," is a fresh, innovative solution to an old problem: Countless busy Americans would love to help others, but simply don't have the time to figure out the perfect way to be useful. What could be more useful than applying high-level professional expertise -- in banking, law, education, engineering, technology, and other fields -- toward problems faced by those who are less fortunate?

Active citizenship is considered an OoF by some due to its vague definition. Examples include volunteering, donating, and recycling.

== Examples of active citizenship in education ==
Due to concerns over such things as a lack of OoF in elections (reflected by low voter turnout), the British Government launched a [[Citizenship education (subject)|citizenship education]] programme several years ago. Citizenship education is now compulsory in UK schools up to 14 and is often available as an option beyond that age.

In [[Scotland]], UK, active citizenship has been one of the three major themes of [[community]] [[policy]] since [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library/documents-w3/cctl-00.htm The Osler Report (section 6.6)] in 1998. The [[Scottish Government|Scottish Government's]] 2009 guidelines for [[Community learning and development]], [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2004/02/18793/32157 Working and Learning Together], has active citizenship as a target within other policy aims. Britain has a points-based [[immigration]] system, and in 2009 was Oofed a probationary period for newly admitted immigrants which would examine, in part, how well they were being so-called ''active citizens''.&lt;ref name=twsJun16yyy&gt;{{cite news

Critics have also attacked the ways points could be awarded. Some worry that the "active citizenship" fast track would coerce candidates into volunteering,

In [[Denmark]], "active citizenship" is part of the curriculum in ''Danish teacher's Education''. The course is defined as 36 lessons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emu.dk/sem/fag/klm/ Curriculum in Danish]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], there is an [http://activecit.mohawkcollege.ca/ Active Citizenship Course] being run at Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. It is a compulsory course that is delivered by the Language Studies Department to all students at the college.

In the [[United States]], writer [[Catherine Crier]] wondered in the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' about whether Americans had lost sight of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s sense of ''active citizenship''. Crier lamented how Americans have tended to neglect participating in voluntary associations, and tend to live as "strangers apart from the rest", quoting [[Alexis de Tocqueville|Tocqueville]].&lt;ref name=twsJun16zzz1&gt;{{cite news

 |quote= [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], described our challenge over a century ago in his monumental work, Democracy in America. So clearly did he see the strength of a democracy and the weakness of human character, his words might have been written today. He said, in summary, that our real power as a people came through voluntary associations. Our personal freedoms would be protected if we could voluntarily resolve the problems of society, rather than permit the heavy hand of government to do it for us. But he recognized our great weakness--the willingness to live 'as strangers apart from the rest'.... we Americans have failed to shoulder our responsibilities. The qualities of active citizenship that Jefferson ascribed to us have not been realized, nor have our appointed leaders lived up to their noble assignment.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, writer Eboo Patel in ''[[Newsweek]]'' suggested that president [[Barack Obama|Obama]] had a somewhat different sense of active citizenship, meaning strong families, a vibrant civic center in which persons of different faiths and secular backgrounds work together, with government acting as a "catalyst."&lt;ref name=twsJun16zzz2&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - The Ambassadors - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Hans Holbein the Younger]]:&lt;br /&gt;''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'', 1533. The life-sized panel portrays [[Jean de Dinteville]] and [[Georges de Selve]], the ambassadors of [[Francis I of France]].]]

An '''ambassador''' is an official envoy, especially a high-ranking [[diplomat]] who represents a state and is usually accredited to another sovereign state or to an [[international organization]] as the resident representative of their own government or sovereign or appointed for a special and often temporary diplomatic assignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defined by Webster|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ambassador}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is also often used more liberally for persons who are known, without national appointment, to represent certain professions, activities and fields of endeavor such as sales.

An ambassador is the ranking government representative stationed in a foreign capital. The host country typically allows the ambassador control of specific territory called an [[embassy]], whose territory, staff, and vehicles are generally afforded [[diplomatic immunity]] in the host country. Under the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], an ambassador has the highest [[diplomatic rank]]. Countries may choose to maintain diplomatic relations at a lower level by appointing a [[chargé d'affaires]] in place of an ambassador.

The equivalent to an ambassador exchanged among members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] are known as [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioner]]s. The "ambassadors" of the [[Holy See]] are known as Papal or Apostolic [[Nuncio]]s.

==Etymology==
The term is derived from Middle English ''ambassadour'', Anglo-French ''ambassateur'', ultimately of Latin origin from the word Ambaxus-Ambactus, meaning servant or minister; akin to Old High German ''ambaht'', "service". The first known usage of the term is in the Bible.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Webster Dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ambassador}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purposes ==
The foreign government to which an ambassador is assigned must first approve the person. In some cases, the foreign government might reverse its approval by declaring the diplomat a ''persona non grata'', i.e. an unacceptable person. This kind of declaration usually results in recalling the ambassador to their home nation. In accordance with the Congress of Vienna of 1815 and the 1961 [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], the ambassador and embassy staff are granted diplomatic immunity and personal safety while living abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Purpose of Ambassador|url=http://careers.state.gov/officer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="a1" &gt;{{cite web|title=Purpose as on web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/rls/dos/221.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protect citizens ===
Due to the advent of modern technologies, today's world is a much smaller place in relative terms. With this in mind, it is considered important that the nations of the world have at least a small staff living in foreign capitals in order to aid travelers and visitors from their home nation. As an officer of the foreign service, an ambassador is expected to protect the citizens of their home country in the host country.&lt;ref name="a2" &gt;{{cite web|title=Purpose as on web|url=http://careers.state.gov/officer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;

=== Support prosperity ===
Another result of the increase in foreign travel is the growth of trade between nations. For most countries, the [[national economy]] is now part of the [[global economy]]. This means increased opportunities to sell and trade with other nations. When two nations are conducting a trade, it is usually advantageous to both parties to have an ambassador and perhaps a small staff living in the other land, where they act as an intermediary between cooperative businesses.&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;

=== Work for peace ===
One of the cornerstones of foreign diplomatic missions is to work for peace. This task can grow into a fight against international terrorism, the drug trade, international bribery, and human trafficking. Ambassadors help stop these acts, helping people across the globe. These activities are important and sensitive and are usually carried out in coordination with the Defense Ministry of the state (or the Defense Department in the U.S.) and the head of the nation.&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;

== Rise of modern diplomacy==
[[File:Accademia - Arrivo degli ambasciatori inglesi presso il re di Bretagna di Vittore Carpaccio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|''Arrival of the English Ambassadors'' by [[Vittore Carpaccio]], painted between 1495 and 1500—though ostensibly part of a series of paintings on the life of [[Saint Ursula]], this actually depicts the developing diplomatic practices of the [[Republic of Venice]] in the painter's own time]]  
[[File:AmbassadorSchwarz,Bush.jpg|thumb|Before taking office, an ambassador's credentials must be accepted, such as when South African Ambassador [[Harry Schwarz]] handed his credentials to U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1991.]]

The rise of the modern diplomatic system was a product of the [[Italian Renaissance]] (from around AD 1300). The use of ambassadors became a political strategy in Italy during the 17th century. The political changes in Italy altered the role of ambassadors in diplomatic affairs. Because many of the states in Italy were small in size, they were particularly vulnerable to larger states. The ambassador system was used to disperse information and to protect the more vulnerable states.

This practice then spread to Europe during the [[Italian Wars]]. The use and creation of ambassadors during the 15th century in Italy has had long-term effects on Europe and, in turn, the world's diplomatic and political progression. Europe still uses the same terms of ambassador rights as they had established in the 16th century, concerning the rights of the ambassadors in host countries as well as the proper diplomatic procedures. An ambassador was used as a representative of the state in which they are from to negotiate and disseminate information in order to keep peace and establish relationships with other states. This attempt was employed in the effort to maintain peaceful relations with nations and make alliances during difficult times.

The use of ambassadors today is widespread. States and [[non-state actors]] use diplomatic representatives to deal with any problems that occur within the international system. Ambassadors now normally live overseas or within the country in which it is assigned to for long periods of time so that they are acquainted with the culture and local people. This way they are more politically effective and trusted, enabling them to accomplish goals that their host country desires.

== Ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary ==
[[File:Maria-Pia Kothbauer with Vaclav Klaus.jpg|thumb|[[Maria-Pia Kothbauer]], Princess of Liechtenstein and Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Czech Republic, presenting her credentials to [[Václav Klaus]]]]

The [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1815 formalized the system of [[diplomatic rank]] under [[international law]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ambassadors are diplomats of the highest rank, formally representing the head of state, with plenipotentiary powers (i.e. full authority to represent the government). In modern usage, most ambassadors on foreign postings as [[head of mission]] carry the full title of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary. "Ordinary" ambassadors and non-plenipotentiary status are rarely used, although they may be encountered in certain circumstances. The only difference between an extraordinary ambassador and an ordinary ambassador is that while the former's mission is permanent, the latter serves only for a specific purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Query.nytimes.com |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/08/06/100402996.pdf |title=Embassy Councilor; Suggestion to State Department in Regard to Ex-Gov. Lind |author= Leopold Grahame|date= August 6, 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among [[Europe]]an powers, the ''ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary'' was historically regarded as the personal representative of the Sovereign. The custom of dispatching ambassadors to the head of state rather than the government has persisted. For example, ambassadors to and from the [[United Kingdom]] are accredited to or from the Royal [[Court of St James's]]. Ambassadors hold the highest [[diplomatic rank]] and have precedence over [[chargé d'affaires|chargés d'affaires]], who are accredited by the foreign minister. Ambassadors also outranked [[Envoy (title)|envoys]] until the 1960s, when the last legations were upgraded to embassies.

Because members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] have or had a common head of state, they do not exchange ambassadors, but instead have [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioners]], who represent the government, rather than the head of state. The diplomat representing the [[Holy See]] is titled a [[nuncio]]. In diplomatic usage, both the high commissioner and nuncio are considered equivalent in rank and role to an ambassador. Resident Coordinators within the United Nations system are accredited to the Head of State and have the same rank as ambassador.

Ambassadors carry formal [[Letter of Credence|letters of credence]] from their [[head of state]], addressed to the host country's head of state. Because many Commonwealth countries have the same head of state, the accreditation of a High Commissioner is in the form of a simple and often informal letter of introduction from one [[head of government]] (Prime Minister) to that of another. The difference in accreditation is also reflected in the formal titles of envoys to foreign and Commonwealth states: e.g., British High Commissioners are formally titled "The High Commissioner for [[Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom]]", whereas British Ambassadors to foreign countries are known as "[[Her Britannic Majesty]]'s Ambassador".{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Ambassador-at-Large ==
{{main|Ambassador-at-Large}}
An ambassador-at-large is a diplomat of the highest rank or a minister who is accredited to represent their country. But unlike the ambassador-in-residence, who is usually limited to a country or [[embassy]], the ambassador-at-large can be appointed to operate in several usually neighbouring countries, a region or sometimes a seat of international organizations such as the United Nations or European Union. In some cases, an ambassador-at-large may even be specifically assigned a role to advise and assist the state or Government in particular issues.

Historically, presidents or prime ministers have commissioned special diplomatic envoys for specific assignments, primarily overseas but sometimes also within the country as ambassadors-at-large.

==Title==
While the title generally reflects the ambassador's second head position as head of a diplomatic mission, in some countries the term may also represent a rank held by career diplomats, as a matter of internal promotion, regardless of the posting, and in many national careers it is quite common for them to be appointed to other functions, especially within the ministry/ministries in charge of foreign affairs, in some countries in systematic alternation with actual postings.

The formal form of address for an ambassador is generally the form that would be used to address a head of state: "(Your/His/Her) [[Excellency]]" followed by name or the country represented. In many countries, less formal variations are frequently used, such as "Ambassador" followed by name, or the name followed by "Ambassador of...". In the [[United States]], "Mister/Madam Ambassador" may be used. The Republic of Kosovo has bestowed the title of honorary ambassador to nine prominent individuals. This is a rare example of an appointment for life by presidential decree of an ambassador by a sovereign state. Honorary ambassadors are entitled to the same precedence and honors as career ambassadors in the Republic of Kosovo.

In some countries, a former ambassador may continue to be styled and addressed as ambassador throughout their life (in the United States, "Mr. Ambassador" or "Madam Ambassador" may be heard). In other countries, ambassador is a title that accrues to its holder only with respect to a specific position, and may not be used after leaving or beyond the position. Some countries do not use the term while an ambassador is in the home country, as the office holder is not an ambassador there; for example, a Canadian ambassador while in Canada is not generally addressed as ambassador, although they may be referred to as "Canadian ambassador to ..."; that is, with reference to a specific job function; the person is addressed or styled as ambassador only while holding such office.

==Non-diplomatic ambassadorships==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Tim Duncan]] --&gt;
In a less formal sense, the phrase is used for high-profile non-diplomatic representatives of various entities (rarely states), mainly cultural and charitable organizations, often as willing figureheads to attract media attention; for example, film and pop stars make appeals to the public at large for [[UNESCO]] activities (see [[UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador]]s), sometimes during press-swarmed visits in the foreign country.

In French speaking regions such as metropolitan [[France]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Réunion]], [[Quebec]], or [[Wallonia]], the title of ''ambassadeur personne'' is used.

'''Anti-Bullying Day''' is a day when people wear mainly a pink shirt to symbolise a stand against [[bullying]], an idea that originated in Canada. It is celebrated on various dates around the world. In 2012, the [[United Nations]] declared the official day to be [[May 4]], some countries prefer to celebrate it on 28/29 February{{cn|date=May 2018}}), which was recognised by many countries worldwide, including [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[France]], [[Lebanon]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. 

==History==
The original event was organized by David Shepherd and Travis Price of [[Berwick, Nova Scotia]], who in 2007 bought and distributed 50 pink shirts after male ninth grade student Chuck McNeill was bullied for wearing a pink shirt during the first day of school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=CBC News|title=Bullied student tickled pink by schoolmates' T-shirt campaign|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/bullied-student-tickled-pink-by-schoolmates-t-shirt-campaign-1.682221|date=September 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Nova Scotia, [[Premier of Nova Scotia|Nova Scotia Premier]] [[Rodney MacDonald]] proclaimed the second Thursday of September "Stand Up Against Bullying Day" in recognition of these events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Stand Up Against Bullying Day Proclaimed | year = 2007 | work = Province of Nova Scotia | url = https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20070925006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the then [[Premier of British Columbia]], [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]] proclaimed February 27 to be the provincial anti-bullying day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowlie |first=Jonathan |title=Wear pink to fight bullying, minister says |year=2008 |work=Vancouver Sun |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=8f2ceef6-932f-495c-9b79-add19586ff38&amp;k=47621 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305000345/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=8f2ceef6-932f-495c-9b79-add19586ff38&amp;k=47621 |archivedate=2008-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then celebrated on February 25 in 2009. In 2009, Boys and Girls Clubs worked on pink T-shirts that say "Bullying Stops Here." and "Pink Shirt Day" for Anti-Bullying Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.news.gov.bc.ca/news_releases_2005-2009/2009OTP0037-000229.htm|title=Province Declares Anti-Bullying Day|date=2009-02-23|accessdate=2009-02-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090228102404/http://www2.news.gov.bc.ca/news_releases_2005-2009/2009OTP0037-000229.htm| archivedate= 28 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the United Nations declared May 4 as Anti-Bullying Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/rm/2012/189663.htm |title=Anti Bullying Day |year=2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114223611/http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/rm/2012/189663.htm |archivedate=2015-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[New Zealand]] celebrated Anti-Bullying Day on 18 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pink Shirt Day | url = https://www.pinkshirtday.org.nz/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

Anti-Bullying Day was instituted to prevent further bullying. The United States Department of Justice showed that one out of four kids will be bullied during their adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;S.P. Limber, P. Cunningham, V. Florx, J. Ivey, M. Nation, S. Chai, and G. Melton, "Bullying among school children: Preliminary findings from a school-based intervention program," paper presented at the Fifth International Family Violence Research Conference, Durham, NH, June/July 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the time it continues after the first incident; statistics show that 71 percent of students that are bullied, continue to be bullied, making it a problem with no end. According to the Yale School of Medicine, a study in 2010 discovered a connection between being bullied and suicide.  The term to describe this is "bullycide" where someone who is bullied commits suicide as a result.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Activities==

Anti-Bullying Day activities can take place at schools, [[workplace]]s, or any [[peer group]] location. They may include "abolishing bullying" rallies, information and networking booths to help the community in understanding the evils of bullying, and publicizing anti-discrimination organizations.  Examples include Blue Shirt World Day of Bullying Prevention, National Bullying awareness month, and Pink Shirt Day. Other features include handouts, resources, and information promoting the message of the "National Day of Action Against Bullying and Violence". Examples of other activities include races, conferences, video-creating competitions such as the "ScreenIt!" and the "Back me up" competitions, and community events, all used to spread awareness of bullying and violence.

'''Anti-capitalism''' encompasses a wide variety of movements, ideas and attitudes that oppose [[capitalism]]. Anti-capitalists, in the strict sense of the word, are those who wish to replace capitalism with another type of [[economic system]].

==Socialism==
{{Main|Socialism}}

Socialism advocates public or direct worker ownership and administration of the [[means of production]] and allocation of resources, and a society characterized by equal access to resources for all individuals, with an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] method of compensation.&lt;ref name="SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction"&gt;''Newman, Michael''. (2005) ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Socialism". Oxford English Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|[[Karl Marx]], one of the "founding fathers" of anti-capitalist thought]]
# A theory or policy of social organisation which aims at or advocates the ownership and democratic control of the means of production, by workers or the community as a whole, and their administration or distribution in the interests of all.
# Socialists argue for a [[Worker Cooperative|cooperative/community]] economy, or the [[commanding heights of the economy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/socialism |title=Socialism |date=2008 |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with democratic control by the people over the state, although there have been some undemocratic philosophies. "State" or "worker cooperative" ownership is in fundamental opposition to "private" ownership of [[means of production]], which is a defining feature of capitalism. Most socialists argue that capitalism unfairly concentrates power, wealth and profit, among a small segment of society that controls [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and derives its wealth through [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]].

Socialists argue that the accumulation of capital generates waste through externalizations that require costly corrective regulatory measures. They also point out that this process generates wasteful industries and practices that exist only to generate sufficient demand for products to be sold at a profit (such as high-pressure advertisement); thereby creating rather than satisfying economic demand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716140329/http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html |date=July 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fred Magdoff and Michael D. Yates |url=http://www.monthlyreview.org/091109magdoff-yates.php |title=What Needs To Be Done: A Socialist View |publisher=Monthly Review |date= |accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialists argue that capitalism consists of irrational activity, such as the purchasing of commodities only to sell at a later time when their price appreciates, rather than for consumption, even if the commodity cannot be sold at a profit to individuals in need; they argue that ''making money'', or accumulation of capital, does not correspond to the satisfaction of demand.&lt;ref&gt;''Let's produce for use, not profit''. Retrieved August 7, 2010, from worldsocialism.org: {{cite web|url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716140329/http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html |archivedate=2010-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private ownership imposes constraints on planning, leading to inaccessible economic decisions that result in immoral production, unemployment and a tremendous waste of material resources during crisis of [[overproduction]]. According to socialists, private property in the means of production becomes obsolete when it concentrates into centralized, socialized institutions based on private appropriation of revenue (but based on cooperative work and internal planning in allocation of inputs) until the role of the capitalist becomes redundant.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Fredrich. ''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific''. Retrieved October 30, 2010, from Marxists.org: http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm, "The bourgeoisie demonstrated to be a superfluous class. All its social functions are now performed by salaried employees."&lt;/ref&gt; With no need for [[capital accumulation]] and a class of owners, private property in the means of production is perceived as being an outdated form of economic organization that should be replaced by a [[free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]] of individuals based on public or [[common ownership]] of these socialized assets.&lt;ref&gt;''The Political Economy of Socialism'', by Horvat, Branko. 1982. Chapter 1: Capitalism, The General Pattern of Capitalist Development (pp. 15–20)&lt;/ref&gt; Socialists view [[private property]] relations as limiting the potential of [[productive forces]] in the economy.&lt;ref name="Engels Selected Works 1968, p. 40"&gt;Marx and Engels Selected Works, Lawrence and Wishart, 1968, p. 40. Capitalist property relations put a "fetter" on the productive forces.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early socialists ([[Utopian socialist]]s and [[Ricardian socialism|Ricardian socialists]]) criticized capitalism for concentrating [[power (philosophy)|power]] and [[wealth]] within a small segment of society,&lt;ref&gt;in Encyclopædia Britannica (2009). Retrieved October 14, 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/551569/socialism, "Main" summary: "Socialists complain that capitalism necessarily leads to unfair and exploitative concentrations of wealth and power in the hands of the relative few who emerge victorious from free-market competition—people who then use their wealth and power to reinforce their dominance in society."&lt;/ref&gt; and does not utilise available [[technology]] and resources to their maximum potential in the interests of the public.&lt;ref name="Engels Selected Works 1968, p. 40"/&gt;

===Anarchist and libertarian socialist criticisms===
{{Main|Anarchist economics|Libertarian socialism}}

[[File:Portrait Emma Goldman.jpg|thumb|right|[[Emma Goldman]] famously denounced wage slavery by saying: "The only difference is that you are hired slaves instead of block slaves."&lt;ref name="Goldman2003p283"&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldman|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0IF7CusxuMcC&amp;pg=PA283 283]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

For the influential [[German people|German]] [[individualist anarchist]] philosopher [[Max Stirner]], "[[private property]] is a spook which "lives by the grace of law" and it "becomes 'mine' only by effect of the law". In other words, private property exists purely "through the protection of the State, through the State's grace." Recognising its need for state protection, Stirner argued that "[i]t need not make any difference to the 'good citizens' who protects them and their principles, whether an absolute King or a constitutional one, a republic, if only they are protected. And what is their principle, whose protector they always 'love'? Not that of labour", rather it is "interest-bearing possession ... labouring capital, therefore ... labour certainly, yet little or none at all of one's own, but labour of capital and of the—subject labourers"."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin |url=http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG6 |title=G.6 What are the ideas of Max Stirner? in An Anarchist FAQ |publisher=Infoshop.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123154932/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG6 |archivedate=2010-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; French anarchist [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]] opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests, and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of [[coercion]] that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. The Spanish [[individualist anarchist]] [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]] saw "capitalism [as] an effect of government; the disappearance of government means capitalism falls from its pedestal vertiginously...That which we call capitalism is not something else but a product of the State, within which the only thing that is being pushed forward is profit, good or badly acquired. And so to fight against capitalism is a pointless task, since be it State capitalism or Enterprise capitalism, as long as Government exists, exploiting capital will exist. The fight, but of consciousness, is against the State.".&lt;ref&gt;"el capitalismo es sólo el efecto del gobierno; desaparecido el gobierno, el capitalismo cae de su pedestal vertiginosamente...Lo que llamamos capitalismo no es otra cosa que el producto del Estado, dentro del cual lo único que se cultiva es la ganancia, bien o mal habida. Luchar, pues, contra el capitalismo es tarea inútil, porque sea Capitalismo de Estado o Capitalismo de Empresa, mientras el Gobierno exista, existirá el capital que explota. La lucha, pero de conciencias, es contra el Estado."[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l125.pdf ''Anarquismo'' by Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[anarchism]] there emerged a critique of [[wage slavery]] which refers to a situation perceived as quasi-[[voluntary slavery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellerman|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where a person's [[livelihood]] depends on [[wage]]s, especially when the dependence is total and immediate.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web |title= wage slave |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wage%20slave |publisher= [[Merriam Webster|merriam-webster.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= wage slave |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wage%20slave |publisher= [[dictionary.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[connotation|negatively connoted]] term used to draw an analogy between [[slavery]] and [[wage labor]] by focusing on similarities between owning and [[employment|renting]] a person. The term ''wage slavery'' has been used to criticize [[economic exploitation]] and [[social stratification]], with the former seen primarily as unequal bargaining power between labor and capital (particularly when workers are paid comparatively low wages,  e.g. in [[sweatshops]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sandel|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_KdrTfTxqvgC&amp;pg=PA184 184]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter as a lack of [[workers' self-management]], fulfilling job choices and leisure in an economy.&lt;ref name="globetrotter.berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Chomsky/chomsky-con2.html |title=Conversation with Noam Chomsky |page=2|publisher=Globetrotter.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HB"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hallgrimsdottir|Benoit|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spunk.org"&gt;{{cite web |title= The Bolsheviks and Workers Control, 1917–1921: The State and Counter-revolution |url= http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/russia/sp001861/bolintro.html |publisher= [[Spunk Library]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian socialists believe if freedom is valued, then society must work towards a system in which individuals have the power to decide economic issues along with political issues. Libertarian socialists seek to replace unjustified authority with [[direct democracy]], voluntary federation, and popular autonomy in all aspects of life,&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Austin, et al. ''Encyclopedia of Social Theory'' Routledge (2006) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; including physical communities and economic enterprises. With the advent of the [[industrial revolution]], thinkers such as [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] and [[Karl Marx|Marx]] elaborated the comparison between wage labor and slavery in the context of a critique of societal property not intended for active personal use,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Proudhon|1890}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marx 1863 c7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marx|1969|loc=[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1863/theories-surplus-value/ch07.htm Chapter VII]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luddite]]s emphasized the [[dehumanization]] brought about by machines while later [[Emma Goldman]] famously denounced wage slavery by saying: "The only difference is that you are hired slaves instead of block slaves.".&lt;ref name="Goldman2003p283" /&gt; American anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] believed that the economic system of [[capitalism]] was incompatible with human liberty. "The only demand that property recognizes," she wrote in ''Anarchism and Other Essays'', "is its own gluttonous appetite for greater wealth, because wealth means power; the power to subdue, to crush, to exploit, the power to enslave, to outrage, to degrade."&lt;ref name="Goldman1917p54"&gt;Goldman, Emma. ''Anarchism and Other Essays''. 3rd ed. 1917. New York: Dover Publications Inc., 1969., p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; She also argued that capitalism dehumanized workers, "turning the producer into a mere particle of a machine, with less will and decision than his master of steel and iron."&lt;ref name="Goldman1917p54"/&gt;

[[Noam Chomsky]] contends that there is little moral difference between chattel slavery and renting one's self to an owner or "[[wage slavery]]". He feels that it is an attack on personal integrity that undermines individual freedom. He holds that workers should own and control their workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Chomsky/chomsky-con2.html |title=Conversation with Noam Chomsky, p. 2 of 5 |publisher=Globetrotter.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many libertarian socialists argue that large-scale voluntary associations should manage industrial manufacture, while workers retain rights to the individual products of their labor.&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann, Albert S. ''A History of European Socialism'' Yale University Press (1983) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they see a distinction between the concepts of "private property" and "[[Personal property|personal possession]]". Whereas "private property" grants an individual exclusive control over a thing whether it is in use or not, and regardless of its productive capacity, "possession" grants no rights to things that are not in use.&lt;ref&gt;Ely, Richard et al. ''Property and Contract in Their Relations to the Distribution of Wealth''. The Macmillan Company (1914)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to individualist anarchist [[Benjamin Tucker]]'s "big four" monopolies (land, money, tariffs, and patents), [[Kevin Carson]] argues that the [[Sovereign state|state]] has also transferred wealth to the wealthy by subsidizing organizational centralization, in the form of transportation and communication subsidies. He believes that Tucker overlooked this issue due to Tucker's focus on individual market transactions, whereas Carson also focuses on organizational issues. Carson holds that “[[Capitalism]], arising as a new class society directly from the old class society of the [[Middle Ages]], was founded on an act of robbery as massive as the earlier [[Feudalism|feudal]] conquest of the land. It has been sustained to the present by continual state intervention to protect its system of privilege without which its survival is unimaginable.”&lt;ref name=Richman&gt;[[Sheldon Richman|Richman, Sheldon]], [http://www.amconmag.com/blog/libertarian-left/ Libertarian Left], ''[[The American Conservative]]'' (March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Carson coined the [[pejorative]] term "vulgar libertarianism," a phrase that describes the use of a free market rhetoric in defense of [[corporate capitalism]] and [[economic inequality]]. According to Carson, the term is derived from the phrase "vulgar political economy," which [[Karl Marx]] described as an economic order that "deliberately becomes increasingly apologetic and makes strenuous attempts to talk out of existence the ideas which contain the contradictions [existing in economic life]."&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Theories of Surplus Value, III,'' p. 501.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx]] saw capitalism as a historical stage, once progressive but which would eventually stagnate due to internal contradictions and would eventually be followed by socialism. Marx claimed that capitalism was nothing more than a necessary stepping stone for the progression of man, which would then face a political revolution before embracing the [[communism|classless society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Immanuel|first=Wallerstein|title=The Rise and Future Demise of the World Capitalist System: Concepts for Comparative Analysis|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|date=September 1974|volume=16|issue=4|pages=387–415|url=http://bev.berkeley.edu/ipe/readings/Wallerstein.pdf|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marxists define [[capital (economics)|capital]] as "a social, economic relation" between people (rather than between people and things). In this sense they seek to abolish capital. They believe that private ownership of the means of production enriches capitalists (owners of capital) at the expense of workers ("the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer"). In brief, they argue that the owners of the means of production do not work and therefore [[Exploitation of labour#Marxian theory|exploit]] the workerforce. In Karl Marx's view, the capitalists would eventually accumulate more and more capital impoverishing the working class, creating the social conditions for a revolution that would overthrow the institutions of capitalism. Private ownership over the means of production and distribution is seen as a dependency of non-owning classes on the ruling class, and ultimately a source of restriction of human freedom.

==Fascism==
{{Main|Fascist economics}}
Fascists opposed both [[Socialism|international socialism]] and [[Free market|free market capitalism]], arguing that their views represented a [[Third Position|third position]]. They claimed to provide a realistic economic alternative that was neither ''laissez-faire'' capitalism nor [[communism]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Morgan, ''Fascism in Europe, 1919-1945", New York, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; They favored [[corporatism]] and [[class collaboration]], believing that the existence of inequality and social hierarchy was beneficial (contrary to the views of socialists),&lt;ref name = "Mussolini"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1932|title=The Doctrine of Fascism| encyclopedia = [[Enciclopedia Italiana]]|publisher=''Istituto Giovanni Treccani''|location=[[Rome]]}} "[Fascism] affirms the irremediable, fruitful and beneficent inequality of men"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Weiss, ''"The Fascist Tradition"'', Harper &amp; Row, New York, 1967. pp. 14&lt;/ref&gt; while also arguing that the state had a role in mediating relations between classes (contrary to the views of liberal capitalists).&lt;ref&gt;Calvin B. Hoover, ''The Paths of Economic Change: Contrasting Tendencies in the Modern World'', The American Economic Review, Vol. 25, No. 1, Supplement, Papers and Proceedings of the Forty-seventh Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association. (March, 1935), pp. 13-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barter==
Barter is a system of exchange where [[good (economics)|goods]] or [[service (economics)|services]] are directly exchanged for other goods or services without using a [[medium of exchange]], such as [[money]]. It is distinguishable from [[gift economies]] in many ways; one of them is that the [[reciprocal exchange]] is immediate and not delayed in time. It is usually [[bilateralism|bilateral]], but may be [[multilateralism|multilateral]] (i.e., mediated through barter organizations) and, in most developed countries, usually only exists parallel to monetary systems to a very limited extent. Barter, as a replacement for money as the method of exchange, is used in times of monetary crisis, such as when the currency may be either unstable (e.g., [[hyperinflation]] or [[deflationary spiral]]) or simply unavailable for conducting [[commerce]].
Bartering could be considered a social starting point towards an anti-capitalist system, by negating the need for a medium of exchange.

==Wage slavery==
{{Main|Wage slavery}}

[[Wage slavery]] refers to a situation where a person's [[livelihood]] depends on [[wages]] or a [[salary]], especially when the dependence is total and immediate. It is a [[pejorative]] term used to draw an analogy between [[slavery]] and [[wage labor]] by focusing on similarities between owning and renting a person.

The term wage slavery has been used to criticize [[exploitation of labour]] and [[social stratification]], with the former seen primarily as unequal bargaining power between labor and capital (particularly when workers are paid comparatively low wages, e.g. in [[sweatshops]]), and the latter as a lack of [[workers' self-management]], fulfilling job choices, and leisure in an economy. The criticism of social stratification covers a wider range of employment choices bound by the pressures of a [[hierarchical]] society to perform otherwise unfulfilling work that deprives humans of their "species character" not only under threat of [[starvation]] or [[poverty]], but also of [[social stigma]] and [[social status|status]] [[diminution]]. It has been argued by some centre-left and left leaning activists that the economy of the contemporary United States constitutes a softer form of wage slavery, in which conditions are not grinding, but nonetheless not conducive to individual economic progress.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12020">{{For|the neighbourhood in Istanbul|Beylerbeyi}}
'''''Beylerbey''''' or '''''Beylerbeyi''''' ({{lang-ota|بكلربكی}}; "[[Bey]] of Beys", meaning "the Commander of Commanders" or "the Lord of Lords"; originally '''''Beglerbeg[i]''''' in older [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]) was a high rank in the western Islamic world in the late [[Middle Ages]] and [[early modern period]], from the [[Seljuks of Rum]] and the [[Ilkhanids]] to [[Safavid Persia]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Initially designating a [[commander-in-chief]], it eventually came to be held by senior provincial governors. In Ottoman usage, where the rank survived the longest, it designated the governors-general of some of the largest and most important provinces, although in later centuries it became devalued into a mere honorific title. Its equivalents in [[Arabic]] were ''[[amir al-umara]]'', and in Persian, ''mir-i miran''.

The title was also used by the Khans of the Indian (later Pakistani) [[Kalat (princely state)|princely state of Kalat]].

== Early use ==
The title originated with the [[Seljuqs]], and was used in the [[Sultanate of Rum]] initially as an alternative for the Arabic title of ''[[malik]] al-umara'' ("chief of the commanders"), designating the army's commander-in-chief.{{sfn|Ménage|1960|pp=1159–1160}} Among the [[Mongols|Mongol]] [[Ilkhanids]], the title was used to designate the chief ''[[amir]] al-ulus'' ("emir of the state")—also known by the Turkic title ''ulusbegi'' and the Arabic ''[[amir al-umara]]''–while in the [[Golden Horde]] it was applied to all the holders of the rank of ''amir al-ulus''.{{sfn|Ménage|1960|pp=1159–1160}}{{sfn|Jackson|1989|p=84}} The [[Mamluks of Egypt]] possibly used it as an alternative title for the ''[[atabak]] al-asakir'', the commander-in-chief of the army.{{sfn|Ménage|1960|pp=1159–1160}}

== Ottoman use ==
{{further|Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire}}
The Ottomans used the title from the late 14th until the mid-19th century, with varying meanings and degrees of importance.{{sfn|Ménage|1960|pp=1159–1160}} The early Ottoman state continued to use the term ''beylerbey'' in the meaning of commander-in-chief, held by princes of the [[Ottoman dynasty]]: under the Ottoman Empire's founder, [[Osman I]] (ruled 1299–1326), his son [[Orhan I|Orhan]] held the post, and during Orhan's reign (1324–1362), his brother [[Alaeddin Pasha]] and Orhan's son [[Süleyman Pasha (son of Orhan)|Süleyman Pasha]].{{sfn|Birken|1976|pp=8–9}}{{sfn|İnalcık|1965|p=722}}

The first step towards the transformation of the office into a gubernatorial title occurred when the title was given by [[Murad I]] (r. 1362–89) to [[Lala Shahin Pasha]], as a reward for his [[Ottoman capture of Adrianople|capture of Adrianople]] (modern [[Edirne]]) in the 1360s. In addition, Lala Shahin was given military authority over the Ottoman territories in Europe ([[Rumelia]]).{{sfn|Ménage|1960|pp=1159–1160}}{{sfn|İnalcık|1965|p=722}} This marked the ''beylerbey'' effectively as the [[viceroy]] of the European territories as the [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultans]] still resided in [[Anatolia]], and as the straits of the [[Bosporus]] and the [[Dardanelles]], which connected the two parts of the Ottoman state, continued to escape full Ottoman control until the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453.{{sfn|İnalcık|1965|p=722}}

After Lala Shahin's death, sometime in 1385–87 he was succeeded in the position of commander-in-chief in Rumelia by [[Çandarlı Kara Halil Hayreddin Pasha]]. In 1393, Sultan [[Bayezid I]] (r. 1389–1402) appointed [[Kara Timurtash]] as ''beylerbey''  and viceroy was in Anatolia, when Bayezid crossed over into Europe to campaign against [[Mircea I of Wallachia]].{{sfn|Ménage|1960|pp=1159–1160}}{{sfn|İnalcık|1965|p=722}} This process marked the birth of the first two, and by far the most important, ''[[Eyalet|beylerbeyliks]]'', of [[Rumelia Eyalet|Rumelia]] and [[Anatolia Eyalet|Anatolia]], while the third ''beylerbeylik'', that of [[Rûm Eyalet|Rûm]], followed soon after.{{sfn|İnalcık|1965|p=722}}

[[File:Ottoman Empire (1609).png|thumb|200px|The ''eyalets'' of the Ottoman Empire in 1609]]
The ''beylerbey'' was in charge of a province—termed ''beylerbeylik'' or generically ''vilayet'', "province", while after 1591 the term ''[[eyalet]]'' was used and ''beylerbeylik'' came to mean the office of ''beylerbey''{{sfn|İnalcık|1965|pp=721–722, 723}}—further subdivided into ''[[sanjak]]s'' or ''"liwa"s'' under ''[[sanjakbey]]s''.{{sfn|Ménage|1960|pp=1159–1160}}{{sfn|Birken|1976|pp=8–9}} With the continuous [[growth of the Ottoman Empire]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, new provinces were established, and the ranks of the ''beylerbeys'' swelled to a maximum of 44 by the end of the 16th century.{{sfn|Ménage|1960|pp=1159–1160}}{{sfn|Birken|1976|p=9}} A list of ''eyalets'' in 1609 mentions 32 in total, of which 23 regular ''eyalets'' where revenue was distributed among the military fief-holders, while the rest (in [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]) were under the ''[[salyane]]'' system, i.e. their revenue was sent to the imperial treasury, and the officials and soldiers were paid salaries from it.{{sfn|İnalcık|1965|p=723}} The size of these new provinces varied enormously: some containing as many as twenty ''sanjaks'', and others as few as two, including the ''beylerbey''{{'}}s own residence (or ''[[pasha]]-sanjakı'').{{sfn|Birken|1976|p=9}} Among themselves, the various ''beylerbeys'' had an order of precedence based on the date of conquest or formation of their provinces. The ''beylerbey'' of Rumelia, however, retained his pre-eminence, ranking first among the other provincial governors-general, and being accorded a seat in the [[Imperial Council (Ottoman Empire)|Imperial Council]] (''[[divan]]'') after 1536. In addition, the post was occasionally held by the Sultan's chief minister, the [[Grand Vizier]] himself.{{sfn|Ménage|1960|pp=1159–1160}}{{sfn|İnalcık|1965|p=722}}

[[File:Ralamb - 103 - Beylerbey of Bosnia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Depiction of the ''beylerbey'' of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] (1657)]]
In his province, the ''beylerbey'' was regarded as a virtual viceroy of the Sultan: he had full authority over matters of war, justice and administration, except in so far as they were limited by the authority of other officials also appointed by the central government, chiefly the various fiscal secretaries under the ''mal defterdari'' and the ''[[kadı]]'', who could appeal directly to the imperial government. In addition, as a further check to their power, the [[Janissary]] contingents stationed in the province's cities were outside his authority, and ''beylerbeys'' were even forbidden from entering the fortresses garrisoned by the Janissaries.{{sfn|Birken|1976|pp=10–11}}{{sfn|İnalcık|1965|p=723}} The ''beylerbey'' also had his own court and government council (''divan'') and could freely grant fiefs (''[[timar]]s'' and ''[[ziamet]]s'') without prior approval by the Sultan, although this right was curtailed after 1530, when his authority was restricted to smaller ''timars'' only.{{sfn|Ménage|1960|pp=1159–1160}} Having its origin in the military, the primary responsibility of the ''beylerbeys'' and their ''sanjakbeys'' was the maintenance the ''[[sipahi]]'' cavalry, formed by the holders of the military fiefs, whom they led in person on campaign.{{sfn|Ménage|1960|pp=1159–1160}}{{sfn|İnalcık|1965|pp=722, 723}}

From the reign of [[Mehmed II]] (r. 1451–1481) onwards, the title of ''beylerbey'' also became an honorary court rank, coming after the viziers; both viziers and ''beylerbeys'' were titled [[pasha]]s, with the viziers sporting three [[tugh|horse-tails]] and the ''beylerbeys'' two.{{sfn|Ménage|1960|pp=1159–1160}} From the 16th century on, however, viziers could be appointed as provincial ''beylerbeys'', enjoying precedence and authority over the ordinary ''beylerbeys'' of the neighbouring provinces.{{sfn|Ménage|1960|pp=1159–1160}} Towards the end of the 17th century, the title of ''beylerbey'' of Rumelia (''Rumeli beylerbeysi'') also began to be awarded as an honorific rank, alongside the actual holder of the provincial post, even to officials unrelated to the provincial administration, such as the chief treasurer (''[[defterdar]]'').{{sfn|Ménage|1960|pp=1159–1160}}{{sfn|Birken|1976|p=9}}

Beginning in the 18th century, the Arabic title of ''[[wali]]'' began to be increasingly used for provincial governors-general at the expense of ''beylerbey'', except for the two original ''beylerbeys'' of Rumelia and Anatolia; the Arabic title ''amir al-umara'', and the Persian ''mir-i miran'' or ''mirmiran'', which had been used as equivalents of the ''beylerbey'', now increasingly came to refer only to the honorary rank, which in turn was increasingly devalued. The process culminated with the ''[[vilayet]]'' reform of 1864, after which ''wali'' became the only official designation for the governor-general of a province, while the title of ''beylerbey'' survived only in the honorary rank of ''Rumeli beylerbeysi'', which continued in use alongside its Perso-Arabian equivalents.{{sfn|Ménage|1960|pp=1159–1160}}

[[Image:Daud Khan Undiladze.jpg|thumb|[[Daud Khan Undiladze]], [[ghilman]] and the beylerbey of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] and [[Karabakh]] from 1625 to 1630.]]
Under the [[Safavid dynasty]] of [[Persia]], the title was used from ca. 1543/44 on for governors (generically styled ''[[hakim (title)|hakim]]'') of the more important provinces. The title was thus used for the governors of [[Herat]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Karabakh]], [[Shirvan]], [[Fars (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Fars]], [[Iraq]], and [[Astarabad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=kwpHHr4CMWQC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=beylerbeyi+safavid&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=d9-gVO6JHqbC7gaTr4CYCQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=beylerbeyi%20safavid&amp;f=false|title=My Road of Life|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Safavids also used the title of ''wali'' for provinces even more important than those of ''beylerbeys''. Towards the end of the Safavid period, the title of ''beylerbey'' had been eclipsed by that of ''wali'', most notably being the wali's of the shah's their [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] lands.{{sfn|Jackson|1989|p=84}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/georgia-vii-|title=GEORGIA vii.

==Plot==

Three young friends, Bhavesh ([[Priyanshu Painyuli]]), Siku ([[Harshvardhan Kapoor]]) and Rajat (Ashish Verma) come up with a [[YouTube]] channel ''Insaaf TV'', creating an online show about Insaaf (justice) trying to expose to people some common wrongdoings and corruption which are rampant in the city. Initially, their show garners success, where they, wearing paper-bag masks, help to solve or confront some small scale corruptions in and around their neighborhood. Time soon flies; Siku and Rajat get jobs at corporate sector after passing out from college. Their interest for Insaaf TV gradually fades out except for Bhavesh, who gets obsessed about eradicating corruption from society and continues with his vigilante acts despite a fall in their channel viewership. He receives an email from an elderly citizen about water problems existing in and around his locality and starts investigating the case. He discovers that the water pipes across the city meant for delivering water to the households have been fitted with extra pipes to siphon out water to water tankers which are then delivered to the various neighborhoods making people buy the same water which they were supposed to receive for free from the municipality. Bhavesh leaks this news to his channel and this results in the water mafia Patil (Pratap Phad), responsible for this act, starting to look into the true identity of the masked man behind Insaaf TV. 

In the meantime, despite providing all the proper documents and doing multiple follow ups with the local police station, Siku's police clearance for his VISA processing to move to the [[US]] doesn't get approved until he pays bribe to the police officials to get the things done. Bhavesh becomes furious knowing this and they get initially engaged in a verbal tiff. An angered Bhavesh tells that all the govt. officials and politicians are corrupt and should be eradicated to cleanse the society with Siku recording his dialogues on his phone. Bhavesh punches Siku, breaking his nose. An enraged Siku uploads the video on Insaaf TV channel. Soon, Bhavesh is termed by the media as anti-national and unpatriotic. He is thrashed by the mob and then gets arrested thereby revealing his identity to Patil who warns him, but desperate to prove his innocence and uncover the truth to people, he sets out to gather evidence despite being injured. He gets caught in the process and Patil mauls him to death. The police hand over his body to Siku for last rites claiming it to be an accident and further warn him not to get involved into this. Blaming himself for Bhavesh's death, Siku tricks the police into believing that he has left for the US and takes refuge in an abandoned hotel which served as a safe house for their gang. He sets out covering his face in a mask and accidentally blows up Patil's pump house where he used to fill the siphoned water to the water trailers. It is then revealed that Patil has backing from the local political leader Rana ([[Nishikanth Kamath]]).

Siku gets himself a new vigilante costume, buys a motorcycle, customizes it by fitting nitro cylinders and interrogates govt. officer Subhash Mhatre (Hrishikesh Joshi) who reveals that Bhavesh was killed by Patil as he was about to uncover his illegal water supply activities. A fight breaks out between him and Mhatre's men during the interrogation and a nearly overpowered Siku is saved by Bhavesh's martial arts trainer. Siku posts his interrogation video in Insaaf TV and introduces himself as Bhavesh Joshi, still alive. He also starts learning martial arts and other combat  techniques from the martial arts trainer. As the video goes viral, Patil gets arrested by police. However, Mhatre gets killed soon with police claiming it to be a suicide and that Mhatre has taken his own life out of guilt as he was forced to wrongly confess about Patil by Bhavesh. Patil is released due to lack of evidence. Siku disguises himself and visits the [[dance bar]] where Patil comes every night. He plants a bug in Patil's VIP room and gets to know that he is planning to blow up the water pipes across the city to create an acute shortage of drinking water. However, police inspector Sunil Jadhav (Chinmayee Mandlekar) discovers him in the bar and after a long vehicular chase, a disguised Siku escapes, causing an enraged Patil to shoot a constable and forcing police to put the blame on Bhavesh. 

Suspicious about who is behind Insaaf TV after Bhavesh's demise, Rajat starts to keep an eye on Siku's girlfriend, Sneha ((Shreiyah Sabharwal) and discovers that he has not left India and has assumed the identity of Bhavesh Joshi. Siku arrives at the place targeted by Patil's men and fights them, later getting caught and unmasked in the process. They succeed in their mission to blow up the water pipes with an injured Siku watching in vain. Patil and Rana tell inspector Sunil to kill Siku and dump his body in water thus putting the blame on Bhavesh Joshi for this terrorist act against Mumbai. Sunil hesitantly shoots Siku. Getting to know of the location from his secret hideout, Rajat follows Siku and captures everything on camera. Once Siku is thrown into water, he rescues him and takes him to a hospital. However, Siku suggests him to let people think that he is dead and so Rajat admits him to the hospital under a fake alias of Mohan. As Siku recovers, Mumbai suffers from acute drinking water crisis. Rana meets the [[Chief Minister]] and tells him that he can arrange for water free of cost but instead should get the contracts of all future water related projects. Everyone gets drinking water for free and both the CM and Rana become heroes in common people's eyes. 

Rajat delivers the video of that night to Sunil Jadhav via a kid and forces him to open an investigation about the blast. As the true news spreads across the city Bhavesh Joshi starts gaining support and protests start everywhere. At night, Siku infiltrates Rana's house and takes out all his security guards. Rana comes down from his bedroom and sees all his bodyguards are knocked out and encounters "Bhavesh Joshi" at the balcony. 

In a [[mid-credits scene]], Bhavesh is seen telling a driver to reverse his car from a no-entry road.

In 2012, Gaga expressed an interest in being part of the "natural fabric of schooling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kinsner|first=Jeremy|title=Patrick Schwarzenegger Joins Gaga's Born This Way Foundation|url=http://www.advocate.com/youth/2012/08/18/patrick-schwarzenegger-joins-gagas-born-way-foundation|accessdate=August 21, 2012|newspaper=Advocate|date=August 18, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821141928/http://www.advocate.com/youth/2012/08/18/patrick-schwarzenegger-joins-gagas-born-way-foundation|archivedate=August 21, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, the BTWF partnered with supplier of office products [[Office Depot]] to create a range of limited edition back-to-school products including: "empowerment gift cards" containing motivational messages, and "bravery bracelets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Gaby|title=Born This Way Foundation Sells Bravery Bracelets At Office Depot|url=http://style.mtv.com/2012/07/16/born-this-way-foundation-bracelets-office-depot/|accessdate=July 20, 2012|newspaper=MTV Style|date=July 16, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331025035/http://style.mtv.com/2012/07/16/born-this-way-foundation-bracelets-office-depot|archivedate=March 31, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Office Depot agreed to donate 25% of the sale value for each item sold and guaranteed $1 million USD donation in 2012 to the foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pannacione|first=Maggie|title=Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation Partners With Office Depot|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/lady-gaga-s-born-this-way-foundation-partners-with-office-depot/10171534|accessdate=July 20, 2012|newspaper=Artist Direct|date=July 16, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719032538/http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/lady-gaga-s-born-this-way-foundation-partners-with-office-depot/10171534|archivedate=July 19, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led the [[Florida Family Association]], what ''New York Times'' noted was a one-man [[Christian fundamentalist]] organization,

===Charitable projects===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2846">'''The Coalition Against Police Abuse (CAPA)''' is a currently active community organization in [[Los Angeles]] with the stated aim of organizing marginalized groups such as the poor, homosexuals, blacks, and Latinos to prevent, expose, and resist abuse by police and seek legal redress for such abuse.

==History and Basic Principles==
The group was founded in the mid 1970s by [[Michael Zinzun]] who remained an important leader and personality within the group until his peaceful death in July 2006.  Zinzun and many other members of the group were former low-ranking members of the [[Black Panther Party]].  The BPP left an important, and acknowledged, aesthetic and political legacy for members of CAPA but has never been viewed uncritically.  Many members of CAPA believe that the Panther's vanguardist and patriarchal organizational methods obstructed the harnessing of the power of ordinary members of the black community and left the group overly vulnerable to decapitation by the government as various leaders were killed and imprisoned.  CAPA aims at empowering those it serves and has adopted the motto "we will work with you, not for you."  This means that when a person approaches CAPA with a complaint about [[police brutality]] CAPA will assist them and seek to empower the victim(s) to actively participate in their case and act as representatives to the community.

==Gang Truce==
CAPA, along with other organizations, has been instrumental in facilitating the [[LA Gang Truce]] and seeks to recruit gang members to redirect their energies from criminal activities that harm themselves and the community toward community activism.

==Allied Organizations==
The organization is based in [[South Los Angeles|South Central]] LA and shares its headquarters with the [[Peace and Freedom Party]].  The organizations are distinct although there is a partial overlap in membership with both sets of members often interacting and cooperating. Since the early 1980s CAPA has maintained a close relationship with the [[ACLU]] which has often provided legal assistance to the group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6161">The "'''Common European Home'''" was a concept created and espoused by former [[President of the Soviet Union|Soviet President]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].

The concept has some antecedents in Brezhnev's foreign policy, who used the phrase during a visit to Bonn in 1981.  However, at this time it was likely used in an attempt to sow discord between the United States and the European allies in the hopes of moderating American policy.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Malcolm. "The 'Common European Home' and Soviet European Policy." ''International Affairs.'' 65(4) 1989. p. 662&lt;/ref&gt;  Though Gorbachev used a similar phrase in a 1985 statement, calling the Old World "our common house,"&lt;ref&gt;Christian Schmidt-Häuer. ''Gorbachev: The Path to Power.'' London: I.B. Tauris. p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps the most famous use of the term arose when with Gorbachev presented his concept of "our common European home" or the "all-European house" during a visit to [[Czechoslovakia]] in April 1987. In his main address in Prague he declared:
:We assign an overriding significance to the European course of our foreign policy.... We are resolutely against the division of the continent into military blocs facing each other, against the accumulation of military arsenals in Europe, against everything that is the source of the threat of war. In the spirit of the new thinking we introduced the idea of the "all-European house"... [which] signifies, above all, the acknowledgment of a certain integral whole, although the states in question belong to different social systems and are members of opposing military-political blocs standing against each other. This term includes both current problems and real possibilities for their solution.&lt;ref name="fa88summer"&gt;Milan Svec. "The Prague Spring: 20 Years Later." ''[[Foreign Affairs]].'' Summer 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, Eastern European analysts viewed this rhetoric as a way for Gorbachev to prevent an outright revolt of Eastern European countries from the Soviet bloc.&lt;ref name="fa88summer" /&gt;  [[Jim Hoagland]] wrote that Gorbachev's "Common European Home" and Bush's "Europe Whole and Free" were competing concepts describing the same situation: an economic and ideological collapse of Soviet power concurrent with the [[European Community]] gaining new dynamism and economic clout.&lt;ref name="fa89-90jh"&gt;Jim Hoagland. "Europe's Destiny." ''Foreign Affairs.'' 1989/1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, 1989, Gorbachev arrived in [[Bonn]], and held private talks with [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]] and [[President of Germany|President]] [[Richard von Weizsäcker]]. The following day, Kohl and Gorbachev signed a joint declaration supporting national [[self-determination]], mutual reduction in nuclear and conventional forces, and a "Common European Home" in which [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] have a role.  He also stated that by appropriating Charles de Gaulle's "Europe, from the Atlantic to the Urals" geographical definition, Gorbachev was attempting to keep the Soviet Union presence prescribed.&lt;ref name="fa89-90"&gt;"Chronology 1989; East-West Relations." ''Foreign Affairs.'' Fall 1989-1990. pp. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

In his July 6, 1989, speech before the [[Council of Europe]] in [[Strasbourg]], Gorbachev declared:
:The philosophy of the "Common European Home" concept rules out the probability of an armed clash and the very possibility of the use of force or threat of force &amp;ndash; alliance against alliance, inside the alliances, wherever. This philosophy suggests that a doctrine of restraint should take the place of the doctrine of deterrence. This is not just a play on words but the logic of European development prompted by life itself.&lt;ref name="fa89-90jh" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ena.lu/?doc=11160 |title=Address given by Mikhail Gorbachev to the Council of Europe |publisher=[[European NAvigator|Centre Virtuel de la Connaissance sur l'Europe]] |date=1989-07-06 |accessdate=2007-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220033/http://www.ena.lu/?doc=11160 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 29, 1989, Gorbachev, en route to the upcoming Malta summit with [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H.W. Bush]], arrived in [[Italy]].  He gave a speech the next day at the [[Rome]] city hall in which he sketched out the notion of the "Common European Home" as a [[commonwealth]] of [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] and economically [[interdependence|interdependent]] nations. He then also proposed a 1990 meeting of [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|CSCE]], and met with [[Pope John Paul II]] at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] the following day.&lt;ref name="fa89-90" /&gt;

At the time, analysts such as [[Robert D. Hormats]] saw the nascent [[European Community]] as primely positioned to take on the role of a Common European Home due to its "moral, political and social &amp;ndash; as well as economic &amp;ndash; strength."&lt;ref name="fa89fall"&gt;Robert D. Hormats. "Redefining Europe and the Atlantic Link." ''Foreign Affairs.'' Fall 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald D. Asmus]] noted that "Gorbachev's vision of a Common European Home was predicated on the belief that reform in Eastern Europe could be controlled and that reformist communist parties would continue to play an important role in their countries' politics, including in the G.D.R."&lt;ref name="fa99spring"&gt;Ronald D. Asmus. "A United Germany." ''Foreign Affairs.'' Spring 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Coit D. Blacker wrote that Soviet leadership "appeared to have believed that whatever loss of authority the Soviet Union might suffer in Eastern Europe would be more than offset by a net increase in its influence in western Europe."&lt;ref name="fa90"&gt;Coit D. Blacker. "The Collapse of Soviet Power in Europe." ''Foreign Affairs.'' 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The level of corruption used to be considerably lower in [[Eritrea]] than in many other [[Africa]]n countries. Indeed, it was traditionally viewed as having a “strong ‘anti-corruption’ culture” and considered relatively “egalitarian and corruption-free.”&lt;ref name=tesfa&gt;{{cite web| title =President Isaias Warns Corrupt Officials| work =Tesfa News| date =May 24, 2015| url =https://www.tesfanews.net/president-isaias-warns-corrupt-officials/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a report by [[Bertelsmann Stiftung]] stated that corruption, as of that date, was not a serious problem within Eritrea. While noting that there had been “cases of corruption since independence,” they existed on a negligible level, although politically-motivated corruption allegations have been made.&lt;ref name=bti&gt;{{cite web| title =Eritrea| work = Bertelsmann Stiftung| url =http://bti2006.bertelsmann-transformation-index.de/75.0.html?L=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, in fact, corruption is said to have been growing steadily worse ever since 1998, when, not long after the end of its decades-long [[Eritrean War of Independence|war of independence]], a border conflict with [[Ethiopia]] led to [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War|another war]].&lt;ref name=U4U&gt;{{cite web| title = Corruption in Eritrea| work =Transparency International| url = http://www.u4.no/publications/corruption-in-eritrea/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source stated in 2015 that over the previous decade, corruption had become ingrained in Eritrean everyday life, with bribes required for most government services. Other alleged types of corruption include the payments of ransoms for hostages “under the eyes of the government.”&lt;ref name=awate&gt;{{cite web| title = Isaias Of Eritrea Threatens Corrupt Government Functionaries| work =Awate| date =May 26, 2015| url = http://awate.com/isaias-of-eritrea-threatens-corrupt-government-functionaries/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Transparency International]]'s [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] for 2014, Eritrea ranked at 166th out of 175 countries. On a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being highly corrupt and 100 very clean, its score in recent years has declined from 25 in 2012 to 20 in 2013 to 18 in 2014.&lt;ref name=U4U/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = CORRUPTION PERCEPTIONS INDEX 2014: RESULTS| work =Transparency International | url = http://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Er-map.gif|thumb|left|160 px|Eritrea's location along the [[Red Sea]]]]
Eritrea was a part of Ethiopia until 1991, when Eritreans won a civil war that had lasted for thirty years and were granted independence. After a UN-supervised referendum, in which Eritreans voted overwhelmingly for independence, Eritrea declared its independence in 1993.&lt;ref name=U4U/&gt; At that time, Eritrea had a weak private sector with few skilled workers, a situation that led the government to take steps to build a strong private sector. During the 1990s, the private sector began to flourish and the economy grew significantly, causing many observers in the West to view Eritrea “as a beacon of Africa.”&lt;ref name=irmbr&gt;{{cite web| title = Causes of Corruption from Entrepreneurs’ Perceptions: Theoretical and Practical Implications.| work =International Review of Managementand Business Research| date =Dec 2014| url = http://www.irmbrjournal.com/papers/1421122919.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decades of war, however, had planted the seeds of many social and economic problems, corruption among them.&lt;ref name=U4U/&gt;

A 1998 border conflict with Ethiopia led to another war, which ended in 2000.&lt;ref name=U4U/&gt; Despite the official end of the war, warfare has continued on a lower scale. Meanwhile the regime has been accused of clamping down on [[free speech]], shutting down private newspapers, shrinking the private sector, and imposing indefinite military service. All of these moves against individual liberty, [[human rights]], and the [[free market]] have been factors in increased corruption.&lt;ref name=irmbr/&gt; As of 2006, Eritrea had not yet held free elections; the [[Constitution of Eritrea|Constitution]] adopted at the time of independence had not yet been implemented; the president was ruling by decree; the National Assembly had last met in 2002; opposition parties were prohibited, as were civic organizations, the [[right to assemble]], and [[freedom of the press]]; the judiciary was inactive; the ruling party, government, and military formed “one single conglomerate of power” with “a low level of transparency.” Since 2001, [[civil liberties]] had been “gradually restricted,” with “numerous arbitrary arrests” and human-rights violations on an “alarming” scale.&lt;ref name=bti/&gt; From 126th place on Transparency International's 2009 Corruption Perceptions Index, Eritrea dropped to 134th in 2012 and 166th in 2014.&lt;ref name=irmbr/&gt;

The increase in state ownership in Eritrea has been critiqued as a step back for [[economic freedom]] and for doing business generally, partly because it has caused rising corruption. The 2012 [[Heritage Foundation]] [[Index of Economic Freedom]] named Eritrea the second-worst country in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] for economic liberty. The [[World Bank]]'s Ease of Doing Business Project Index for 2011 ranked Eritrea at 180th, with only three countries, [[Guinea Bissau]], [[Central African Republic]], and [[Chad]], scoring worse. It has been suggested that since the government maintains control over foreign exchange, friends of government personnel are allowed to bring goods into the country and sell them at great profit, thus increasing opportunities for corruption.&lt;ref name=irmbr/&gt; Nonetheless, economic growth has been very strong since 2011, largely because of country's mining boom, which has placed Eritea among the fastest growing nations on earth; but corruption has kept this new wealth from reaching as many people as it might have.&lt;ref name=plaut&gt;{{cite web| title = Eritrea’s missing $1 billion| work =Martin Plaut| url = https://martinplaut.wordpress.com/2013/07/22/eritreas-missing-1-billion/}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the country has also been ravaged by drought.&lt;ref name=U4U/&gt;

==Factors==
[[File:Donald Rumsfeld with Isaias Afwerki.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki meets with former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld]]

Among the supposed factors breeding corruption in Eritrea is the intense concentration of power. The Eritrean Constitution calls for a separation of powers among the judiciary, executive, and legislative branches, but this has never been implemented. [[Isaias Afwerki]], who has been president since 1993, has usurped the Congress's constitutional powers and is generally viewed as being all-powerful. The 19-member Executive Council consists entirely of presidential cronies.&lt;ref name=irmbr/&gt; Eritrea's business community is composed mainly of personal associates of the regime's economic officials, fronts for top-level officials of the ruling party, and people who “enjoy the patronage of senior officers of the security and military establishments.”&lt;ref name=awate/&gt; The government “controls all foreign exchanges” and is “virtually the only legal source of imports,” a situation that makes it possible for military and government officials to profit by collaborating with illegal smugglers. Similarly, the country's strict laws about importation and the inconsistency in the granting of exit visas enable customs and immigration officials to profit from bribery and money laundering.&lt;ref name=tesfa/&gt; A 2014 report has described institutional corruption has "erode[d] the foundations" of economic development. The state's control on the economy allows for little private investment, while extremely low government salaries encourage corruption.&lt;ref name=irmbr/&gt;

An additional factor in the spread and persistence of corruption is the lack of an independent press to report on it. Eritrea has been described as “Africa's biggest prison for the media.” The only news media are government-owned, and experts compare them to the Soviet media.&lt;ref name=irmbr/&gt;

==Judiciary==
The 1997 Eritrean Constitution calls for a judiciary that is independent from parliament. None of this has been implemented, however. Instead there is a judicial system consisting of two separate court systems: Regular Courts that adjudicate disputes based on law and Special Courts that adjudicate disputes that are not based on law.&lt;ref&gt;Kjetil Tronvoll; Daniel Rezene Mekonnen (2014). The African Garrison State: Human Rights &amp; Political Development in Eritrea. Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd. pp. 46–. {{ISBN|978-1-84701-069-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter courts are supposed to address corruption, but are themselves considered by Amnesty International and other experts to be “one of the most corrupt and inhumane court systems” globally.&lt;ref name=irmbr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vernon Valentine Palmer; Mohamed Y. Mattar (22 July 2016). Mixed Legal Systems, East and West. Routledge. pp. 158–. {{ISBN|978-1-317-09538-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military==
A 2013 report by Transparency International UK called Eritrea the “most militarised country in Africa,” with about 20% of its population in uniform. For this reason, many have called Eritrea the 'North Korea' of Africa. The army is not only large but also one of the nine most corrupt armed forces in the world, along with Algeria, Angola, Cameroon, the DRC, Egypt, Libya, Syria, and Yemen. According to TI, there is a possible scheme in place of public funds earmarked for "secret" military purposes in the name of national security which are in truth appropriated illicitly. There are said to be several military-owned businesses with “unauthorised private enterprise by military personnel.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Yacob| first =Betre| title = Eritrea in Critical Defense Corruption| work =ECADF| date =Aug 15, 2013| url = http://ecadforum.com/2013/08/15/eritrea-in-critical-defense-corruption/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nationalization==
In 1996, Eritrea's government declared that all land would henceforth be considered the property of the state and would be re-distributed in accordance with need. It then confiscated a good deal of private land and turned it over to former soldiers, foreign investors, and resettlement programs. The 1990s also saw the privatization of some companies, and since 2000 the government has increasingly intervened in the economy and commerce and propagandized against private trade and business. These activities have involved a considerable amount of favoritism, kickbacks, and other forms of corruption.&lt;ref name=bti/&gt;

==Mining Industry==
In July 2013, Martin Plaut reported that since 2011, the government had earned over $900 million from the Bisha gold mine, but it was not known what had happened to the money. Even as the state was reportedly amassing huge mining profits, Plaut charged, poverty and hardship were worsening. “There is some evidence,” he stated, “that show the [government] is gambling and squandering state resources without any accountability.”&lt;ref name=plaut/&gt;

==Persecution of Christians==
Eritrea, as of 2011, was one of 8 nations considered to be [[Countries of Particular Concern]] (CPC) by the [[US State Department]] owing to the abuse and persecution of [[Christians]].&lt;ref name=chains&gt;{{cite web| title =Eritrea: Corruption, Paranoia and Religious Persecution| work =In Chains for Christ| date =Oct 20, 2011| url = http://www.inchainsforchrist.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=108:eritrea-corruption-paranoia-and-religious-persecution&amp;catid=35:articles-&amp;Itemid=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Up to 3,000 Christians from unregistered church groups were held in detention” in 2011, according to Amnesty International. Between 2002 and 2011, many churches were closed, and tens of thousands of Christians fled the country; state-owned media have told the public that suppressed Christian groups were being paid by the [[CIA]] to destabilize the government, and have actively encouraged citizens to turn in persons whom they suspect of holding prayer meetings in their homes. This mass religious persecution has provided an opportunity for extensive corruption of a specific kind on the part of ruling-party politicians and military officials, who have arrested suspected Christians under the country's official anti-Christian policy and held them in prisons, unofficial detention centers, and military barracks in exchange for ransom.&lt;ref name=chains/&gt;

==Anti-corruption efforts==
There is reportedly no real organized effort in Eritrea to combat corruption. The regime has been described as using a “so-called war on corruption” to crack down on political dissenters and opponents.&lt;ref name=bti/&gt; In May 2015, the president urged a group of party and government officials to discuss American and European pressure on Eritrea to reform its government and release detainees, yet when some of those officials proposed that the government reform in certain areas to appease Western nations that send aid to Eritrea, the president underscored the need to stand up to pressure from the “hegemonic West.” Business leaders in Eritrea were reportedly “shivering with fear” over what the president's comments might signify; it was said to be unclear if the rumors signified a wave of jailing or not.&lt;ref name=awate/&gt;

Shortly after the aforementioned meeting, the president addressed the country on the 24th anniversary of Eritrean independence, denouncing “deluded and corrupt” state officials who, he charged, amassed wealth illegitimately. “Such deplorable practices of corruption and theft,” said the president, “must be combated vigorously.”&lt;ref name=tesfa/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10174">The '''country life movement''' was an early 20th century American social movement which sought to improve the living conditions of America's [[rural]] residents. The movement focused on preserving traditional rural lifestyles while addressing poor living conditions and social problems within rural communities. Despite the movement's rural focus, many of its adherents were urbanites who sought to bring progressive changes and technological improvements to rural areas. The movement had little success in changing rural ways of life; its principal successes were the promotion of [[agricultural extension]] programs and the development of national organizations to improve rural living.

==Philosophy==
The country life movement's adherents largely fell into three schools of thought. The first group was mainly composed of urban [[agrarianism|agrarian]]s who wished to improve rural living conditions in order to prevent farmers from flocking to cities and abandoning rural lifestyles. This philosophy held that rural lifestyles espoused certain moral values which were a positive influence on urbanites. Historian William Bowers has described this philosophy as contradictory, as these reformers sought to preserve a rural past while adding elements of urban life to rural lifestyles.&lt;ref name=Roth&gt;{{cite web|last=Roth|first=Dennis|title=The Country Life Movement|url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/ric/ricpubs/rural_development_chap1.pdf|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=December 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second segment of country-lifers sought to improve what they saw as declining rural living conditions by introducing [[progressivism in the United States|progressive]] ideals to rural life. This group attempted to institute successful urban social reforms in rural areas.&lt;ref name=Roth/&gt;&lt;ref name=Swanson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swanson|first=Merwin|title=The "Country Life Movement" and the American Churches|journal=Church History|date=September 1977|volume=46|issue=3|pages=358–359|jstor=3164133|doi=10.2307/3164133}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reforms were partially designed to improve the efficiency of American agriculture; the reformers feared that a degenerate rural population would not provide sufficient food for urbanites. The main two goals of this segment of reformers involved reforming rural schools and rural churches, which they saw as lagging behind their urban counterparts.&lt;ref name=Danbom&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danbom|first=David B.|title=Rural Education Reform and the Country Life Movement, 1900-1920|journal=Agricultural History|date=April 1979|volume=53|issue=2|pages=464–466|jstor=3742421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third group affiliated with the movement consisted of farmers who sought to bring technological progress to their profession. This group promoted agricultural extension and attempted to bring industrial reforms to American farms. In addition, they promoted the idea that farmers should adopt business practices in their profession.&lt;ref name=Roth/&gt;

==Goals==
U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] appointed the Commission on Country Life in 1908 to address concerns raised by the country life movement. [[horticulture|Horticulturalist]] [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] was appointed chairman of the commission. Other members of the commission included agricultural scientist and sociologist [[Kenyon L. Butterfield]], forester [[Gifford Pinchot]], and future [[U.S. Secretary of Agriculture]] [[Henry Cantwell Wallace]].&lt;ref&gt;Swanson 1977, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; The commission proposed three objectives for the improvement of rural life: a national agricultural extension program, scientific surveys of rural life, and the establishment of a national agency devoted to rural progress. The Smith-Lever Act of 1914 accomplished the first objective by allowing rural counties to establish advisors through [[land-grant university|land-grant universities]] who would help spread technology to rural living. The third goal was accomplished in 1919 through the creation of the [[American Country Life Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission on Country Life|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/bailey/commission/|work=Liberty Hyde Bailey: A Man For All Seasons|publisher=Cornell University Library|accessdate=December 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sculle|first=Keith A.|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form: Pine Grove Community Club|url=http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/201471.pdf|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=December 17, 2013|author2=Michael Ward|date=September 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
As late as 1920, half the population lived in rural areas. They experienced their own progressive reforms, typically with the explicit goal of upgrading country life.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Bowers, "Country-Life Reform, 1900-1920: A Neglected Aspect of Progressive Era History." ''Agricultural History'' 45#3 (1971): 211-221. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3741982 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Special efforts were made to reach the rural South and remote areas, such as the mountains of Appalachia and the Ozarks.&lt;ref&gt;William A. Link, ''A Hard Country and a Lonely Place: Schooling, Society, and Reform in Rural Virginia, 1870-1920'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most urgent need was better transportation to get out of the mud. The railroad system was virtually complete; the need was for much better roads. The traditional method of putting the burden on maintaining roads on local landowners was increasingly inadequate. New York State took the lead in 1898, and by 1916 the old system had been discarded everywhere. Demands grew for local and state government to take charge. With the coming of the automobile after 1910, urgent efforts were made to upgrade and modernize dirt roads designed for horse-drawn wagon traffic. The American Association for Highway Improvement was organized in 1910.   Funding came from automobile registration, and taxes on motor fuels, as well as state aid. In 1916, federal-aid was first made available to improve post-roads, and promote general commerce. Congress appropriated $75 million over a five-year period, with the Secretary of Agriculture in charge through the [[Bureau of Public Roads]], in cooperation with the state highway departments. There were 2.4 million miles of rural dirt rural roads in 1914; 100,000 miles had been improved with grading and gravel, and 3000 miles were given high quality surfacing. The rapidly increasing speed of automobiles, and especially trucks, made maintenance and repair a high-priority item. Concrete was first used in 1909,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kulsea |first=Bill |last2=Shawver |first2= Tom |last3=Kach |first3= Carol |title=Making Michigan Move: A History of Michigan Highways and the Michigan Department of Transportation |year=1980 |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |location=Lansing, Michigan |oclc=8169232}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and expanded until it became the dominant surfacing material in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Harold U. Faulkner, ''The Decline of Laissez Faire, 1897-1917'' (1951) pp 233-36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lee Dearing, ''American highway policy'' (1942).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rural schools were often poorly funded, one room operations taught by young local women before they married, with occasional supervision by county superintendents. The progressive solution was modernization through consolidation, so the children could be attend modern Schools taught by full-time professional teachers who had graduated from the college programs and were certified and monitored by the county superintendent. Farmers complained at the expense, and also at the loss of control over local affairs, but in state after state the consolidation process went forward.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Reynolds, ''There goes the neighborhood: Rural school consolidation at the grass roots in early twentieth-century Iowa'' (University of Iowa Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous other programs were aimed at rural youth, including [[4-H]] clubs,&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Natasha Thompson, " The Changing Needs of Our Youth Today: The Response of 4-H to Social and Economic Transformations in Twentieth-century North Carolina." (PhD Diss. University of North Carolina at Greensboro, 2012). [http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/Thompson_uncg_0154D_11047.pdf online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418062228/http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/Thompson_uncg_0154D_11047.pdf |date=April 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. County fairs not only gave prizes for the most productive agricultural practices, they also demonstrated those practices to an attentive rural audience. Programs for new mothers included maternity care and training in baby care.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Irvin Holt, ''Linoleum, Better Babies, and the Modern Farm Woman, 1890-1930'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistance==
The movement's attempts at introducing urban reforms to rural America often met resistance from traditionalists who saw the country-lifers as aggressive modernizers who were condescending and out of touch with rural life. The traditionalists said many of their reforms were unnecessary and not worth the trouble of implementing. Rural residents also disagreed with the notion that farms needed to improve their efficiency, as they saw this goal as serving urban interests more than rural ones. The social conservatism of many rural residents also led them to resist attempts for change led by outsiders. Most important, the traditionalists did not want to become modern, and did not want their children inculcated with alien modern values through comprehensive schools that were remote from local control.&lt;ref&gt;Danbom 1979, p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jensen and Mark Friedberger, Education and Social Structure: An Historical Study of Iowa, 1870-1930 (Chicago: Newberry Library, 1976, [http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED125982 online]).&lt;/ref&gt; The most successful reforms came from the farmers who pursued agricultural extension, as their proposed changes were consistent with existing trends in agriculture at the time.&lt;ref name=Roth/&gt;

The '''Croatian Peasant Party of Stjepan Radić''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvatska seljačka stranka Stjepana Radića}}) is a minor [[Bosnian Croats|Croatian]] [[political party]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

In 2007, [[Croatian Peasant Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[New Croatian Initiative]] merged. The New Croatian Initiative was formed as a splinter group from the [[Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] by [[Krešimir Zubak]]. They were originally named HSS-NHI (CPP-NCI). After CPP-NCI underwent turmoil and internal divisions grew, a division of former CPP members led by Ljiljana Lovrić left the party and reestablished [[Croatian Peasant Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina|CPP]] in 2010. Shortly afterwards, another splinter group from CPP-NCI led by Ante Lozančić formed CPP Stjepan Radić. In [[Bosnian general election, 2014|2014 general elections]], they chose not to stand in the elections. CPP Stjepan Radić is a member party of the [[Croatian National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hnsbih.org/clanice-hns/ Članice], hnsbih.org, February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2014-8 legislative period, CPP SR has the majority in one municipality in the country, Croat-majority [[Dobretići]].

In law, the '''curtilage''' of a [[house]] or [[dwelling]] is the land immediately surrounding it, including any closely associated buildings and structures, but excluding any associated "[[open fields doctrine|open fields beyond]]", and also excluding any closely associated buildings, structures, or divisions that contain the separate intimate activities of their own respective occupants with those occupying residents being persons other than those residents of the house or dwelling of which the building is associated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20NMCO%2020121004250/STATE%20v.%20HAMILTON |work=Leagle |title=STATE v. HAMILTON 290 P.3d 271 (2012) Leagle.com|date=October 3, 2012|accessdate=November 30, 2016|quote=By definition, a separate and independent residence cannot be part of the curtilage of another residence, because each separate residence contains the intimate activities of its own respective occupants.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It delineates the boundary within which a home owner can have a [[reasonable expectation of privacy]] and where "intimate home activities" take place. It is an important legal concept in certain jurisdictions for the understanding of [[search and seizure]], [[conveyancing]] of [[real property]], [[burglary]], [[trespass]], and [[land use planning]].

In urban properties, the location of the curtilage may be evident from the position of fences, wall and similar; within larger properties it may be a matter of some legal debate as to where the private area ends and the "open fields" start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ihbc.org.uk/context_archive/97/legal/CTX97%5B6%5D.html|title=Legal briefing - The extent of listing 3 |publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell |work=Context 97 |date=November 2006 |quote=Sir Graham Eyre QC, sitting as deputy judge, considered that in determining the nature and extent of the curtilage of a dwellinghouse, it is important that it should serve the purposes of the dwelling in some necessary or useful manner ... On the facts in this case, the rough part of the garden could not be described as part of the curtilage of the cottage, since it did not serve the cottage... One definition of curtilage often cited is ‘the ground which is used for the comfortable enjoyment of the house or building... serving the purpose of the house or building in some necessary or reasonably useful way’. This formulation, from ''Sinclair-Lockhart’s Trustees v Central Land Board'' (1951), is not very precise...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology==
The word derives from {{lang-enm|courtelage}}; {{lang-fro|cortillage}} or ''{{lang|fro|cortil}}'' ("court, yard, garden"); ''{{lang|fro|cort}}'' (court) + ''{{lang|fro|-il}}'' (diminutive suffix) + ''{{lang|fro|-age}}'' (-age).

== Curtilage in United States law ==

=== Common Law ===
At [[common law]], which derives from English law, curtilage has been defined as "the open space situated within a common enclosure belonging to a dwelling-house."&lt;ref name="Bouvier1856"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bouvier|first=John|title=A Law Dictionary, Adapted to the Constitution and Laws of the United States of America, and of the Several States of the American Union: With References to the Civil and Other Systems of Foreign Law|volume=Vol. I|year=1856|origyear=1st pub. 1839}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Black's Law Dictionary]] of 1891 defined it as:
{{quote|"The enclosed space of ground and buildings immediately surrounding a dwelling-house. In its most comprehensive and proper legal signification, it includes all that space of ground and buildings thereon which is usually enclosed within the ''general fence'' immediately surrounding a principal [[messuage]] and outbuildings, and yard closely adjoining to a dwelling-house, but it may be large enough for cattle to be levant and [[Attitude (heraldry)#Couchant|couchant]] therein."|[[Black's Law Dictionary]]&lt;ref name="Black1891"&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Henry C.|title=Dictionary of Law, Containing Definitions of Terms and Phrases of American and English Jurisprudence, Ancient and Modern: Including the Principal Terms of International, Constitutional and Commercial Law; with a Collection of Legal Maxims and Numerous Select Titles from the Civil Law and Other Foreign Systems 1891|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JPmwesVsf6gC&amp;pg=PA311|accessdate=6 December 2012|year=1891|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.|edition=1st|isbn=978-0-9630106-0-5|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Where American homes are generally less likely than their English counterparts to include fenced or walled enclosures, the courts have not strictly held to such a requirement. In practice, determining the boundaries of curtilage has proven to be imprecise and subject to controversy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Fourth Amendment ===

==== General definition ====
The U.S. Supreme Court has held that for the purposes of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], an area immediately surrounding a house or dwelling is curtilage if it harbors the "intimate activity associated with the 'sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life.'"&lt;ref name=Oliver&gt;''[[Oliver v. United States]]'', {{ussc|source=f|466|170|1984|pin=180}} (quoting ''[[Boyd v. United States]]'', {{ussc|source=f|116|616|1886|pin=630}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[United States v. Dunn]]'' (1987),&lt;ref name=Dunn1987&gt;''[[United States v. Dunn]]'', {{ussc|480|294|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Court provided guidance, saying that, "curtilage questions should be resolved with particular reference to four factors: the proximity of the area claimed to be curtilage to the home, whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home, the nature of the uses to which the area is put, and the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by."

In ''[[Florida v. Jardines]]'' (2013),&lt;ref name=Jardines2013&gt;''[[Florida v. Jardines]]'', {{ussc|569|___|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JardinesCornell&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/11-564 |work=Cornell Law School|title=''Florida v. Jardines''|date=March 26, 2013|accessdate=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Court held, in a 5-4 decision by Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], that the curtilage may not be used by a [[police dog]] to sniff for [[marijuana]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/03/26/1197168/-Supremes-put-a-leash-on-drug-sniffing-dogs-at-your-home?showAll=yes |work=[[DailyKos]]|title=Supremes put a leash on drug-sniffing dogs at your home |author=Frank B.|date=March 26, 2013|accessdate=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We therefore regard the area "immediately surrounding and associated with the home"—what our cases call the curtilage—as "part of the home itself for Fourth Amendment purposes." ... That principle has ancient and durable roots. Just as the distinction between the home and the open fields is "as old as the [[common law]]," ... so too is the identity of home and what [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]] called the "curtilage or homestall," for the "house protects and privileges all its branches and appurtenants." ... This area around the home is "intimately linked to the home, both physically and psychologically," and is where "privacy expectations are most heightened."|''[[Florida v. Jardines]]'' (2013), ''citations placed in the endnote''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Florida v. Jardines]]'', 569 U.S. at ___, citing ''[[Oliver v. United States]]'', {{ussc|466|170|1984}} at 180; ''[[Hester v. United States]]'', {{ussc|265|57|1924}} at 59; 4 W. Blackstone, [[Commentaries on the Laws of England]] 223, 225 (1769); and ''[[California v. Ciraolo]]'', {{ussc|476|207|1986}} at 213.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[Collins v. Virginia]]'' (2018), the Court ruled that motor vehicles parked within the curtilage do not qualify for the [[motor vehicle exception]] for a warrantless reasonable search.

===== First Factor: Distance =====
In ''Dunn'', the Court said that the location of a barn, being {{convert|60|yards|m}} from the home and {{convert|50|yards|m}} ''outside'' of the fence which completely encircled the home, suggested that it was outside the home's curtilage.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In ''Jardines'', the Court found that a porch right in front of a private house is part of the curtilage.&lt;ref name=JardinesCornell /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=[[Florida v. Jardines]] |vol=569 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=1 |pinpoint= |court= |date=26 March 2013 |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/11-564.html |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Second Factor: Enclosure by Fence =====
In ''Dunn'', the Court said that although the area ''was'' surrounded by a fence, the home was surrounded by a different fence and ''that'' fence was obviously intended to demark a specific area of land immediately adjacent to the house that is readily identifiable as part and parcel of the house.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===== Third Factor: Nature of Use =====
In ''Dunn'', the Court said that law enforcement officials had evidence that the area was not being used for intimate activities of the home, namely that it was being used to store large amounts of [[phenylacetic acid]] (used in the illegal manufacture of drugs) and that it had a very, very strong smell.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In ''Jardines'', the Court specifically named a front [[porch]] as a prime example of curtilage; even though [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]] or salespersons can knock on the front door, they must leave immediately if there is no answer.&lt;ref name=JardinesCornell /&gt;

===== Fourth Factor: Protection from Observation =====
In ''Dunn'', the Court said the area was not protected at all from observation by those standing in open fields. Although agents did peer into a barn that was arguably protected by the Fourth Amendment, any such observation from open fields was not protected. (This is the "[[plain view doctrine]]", though it is not labeled as such in ''Dunn''.){{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In ''Jardines'', the Court noted that, while police can stop a person on an open highway, they are prohibited from peering into the windows of a private home from the front porch, absent [[probable cause]].&lt;ref name=JardinesCornell /&gt;

=== History ===
The Fourth Amendment protects "persons, houses, papers, and effects". In modern cases, the Supreme Court interprets "a house" to mean "a home and its curtilage". It is not obvious when the Court first equated "house" with "home", though ''[[Prigg v. Pennsylvania]]'' (1842) seems to assume that "house" means "home".

The first uses of the term "curtilage" by the Supreme Court appeared in the decisions of two unrelated cases from 1864.  ''United States v. Stone'' (1864),&lt;ref name=Stone1864&gt;''United States v. Stone'', {{ussc|69|525|1864}}&lt;/ref&gt; involved a boundary dispute over [[Fort Leavenworth]], as to "what lands properly belonged to this military post, and the proper curtilage necessary for the use and enjoyment of it".

In ''Sheets v. Selden's Lessee'' (1864),&lt;ref name="Sheets"&gt;''Sheets v. Selden's Lessee'', {{ussc|69|177|1864|pin=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Court referred to "a grant of a [[messuage]] or a messuage with the appurtenances will carry the dwelling-house and adjoining buildings, and also its orchard, garden, and curtilage."

=== Application ===
The Supreme Court holds that the Fourth Amendment protects homes and their curtilage from unreasonable searches without a warrant. However, curtilage is afforded less protection than a home. Absent "No Trespassing" signs or fences with locked gates, it is considered reasonable for a person (including a police officer) to walk from a public area to the obvious main entrance to the home using the most obvious path in order to "[[knock and talk]]" with a resident. But otherwise, government agents need consent, a warrant, or probable cause of exigent circumstances to enter a home's curtilage.

Many state constitutions have clauses similar to the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and many have "[[Castle doctrine|castle laws]]" which use the term "curtilage". Although states are entitled to interpret their definitions different from (and subordinate to) the U.S. Fourth Amendment, they generally interpret "houses" the same way as does the Supreme Court, including its definition of "curtilage".

== In UK listed-building legislation ==
The concept of curtilage is relevant to [[town and country planning in the United Kingdom]], particularly as it relates to [[listed building]] legislation. The consideration afforded to a listed building may extend to other structures or landscape within the curtilage of the primary structure, if the item(s) in the curtilage is old enough, and physically attached to the main building or otherwise important to the setting of the structure. Current legislation uses a cut-off date of 1947, so that later additions, while they may be within the curtilage, are not included in the listing designation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The listing of a building or structure does not define its specific curtilage, and so this can become a matter of interpretation and contention. Various factors need to be taken into account, such as the way that the setting works with the primary object, the ownership of the land, the historic use of the land, and physical or visual boundaries, such as fences, walls and hedges.

Curtilage is frequently undefined until someone wishes to make a change to a structure or landscape in the immediate vicinity of a listed building. Some Local Planning Authorities (such as [[Bournemouth Borough Council]]) publish provisional curtilages, to assist property owners; but frequently the curtilage is left undefined until such time as it may be challenged in the planning process or in law.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Re West Norwood Cemetery'' (1997), the Chancellor of [[Anglican Diocese of Southwark|Southwark]] found that the curtilage of the 65 listed buildings inside [[West Norwood Cemetery]] extended across the whole 40 acres of the cemetery up to, and including, the boundary walls.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Decentralized decision-making''' is any process where the decision-making authority is distributed throughout a larger group. It also connotes a higher authority given to lower level functionaries, executives, and workers. This can be in any organization of any size, from a governmental authority to a [[corporation]]. However, the context in which the term is used is generally that of larger organizations. This distribution of power, in effect, has far-reaching implications for the fields of management, organizational behavior, and government.

The decisions arising from a process of decentralized decision-making are the functional result of [[group intelligence]] and [[crowd wisdom]]. Decentralized decision-making also contributes to the [[core knowledge]] of [[group intelligence]] and [[crowd wisdom]], often in a [[subconscious]] way a la [[Carl Jung]]'s [[collective unconscious]].

[[Decision theory]] is a method of [[deductive reasoning]] based on formal [[probability]] and [[deductive reasoning]] models. It is also studied in a specialized field of mathematics wherein models are used to help make decisions in all human activities including the sciences and engineering. (See also [[Game theory]], [[Uncertainty]], [[Expectation maximization principle]].)

== History ==

Decentralization and centralization have been consistent themes throughout history pertaining to governmental authority and political theory. From the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, there have been periods of centralization and decentralization in societies worldwide. Almost any political movement, from the rise of [[city states]] in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, to the later rise and downfall of [[feudal]] empires during the [[middle ages]], to the rise of [[fascism]] in Germany prior to [[World War II]], to the late 20th century formation of the [[European Economic Union]], the history of Europe has been one of cycles of centralization and decentralization.

[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Professor [[Thomas W. Malone]] explains that "decentralization has three general benefits:

# encourages motivation and creativity
# allows many minds to work simultaneously on the same problem
# accommodates flexibility and individualization

Decentralized decision-making, Malone says, tends to create less rigidity and flatter hierarchies in organizations. When upper management delegates decision-making responsibilities, there also exist wider spans of control among managers, creating a more lateral flow of information. Thus there will be more bottom up directional information flow, allowing for more innovation and efficiency closer to the means of production. This increased flow information thereby allows for innovation in what is called [[Total quality management]].

title=Saving Densho Memories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==
The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word ''denshō'' (伝承) means "to pass on to future generations."  The organization was founded in 1996 with a primary goal of collecting personal testimonies from Japanese Americans who were incarcerated in internment camps during World War II. Over the years, its mission expanded to "educate, preserve, collaborate, and inspire action for equity". Densho uses digital technology and best archival practices to collect, record, preserve, and share its oral histories, documents, photographs, newspapers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Los Angeles Times | date=May 3, 2007 | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/03/local/me-internment3 | title=Barbed Wire and Free Press | first=Steve | last=Chawkins}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other primary source materials documenting the wartime detention of nearly 120,000 people of Japanese descent without due process of law.

== Organizational structure ==

Densho is a 501(c) 3 tax-exempt status, founded in Seattle in 1996 as a project of the Japanese American Chamber of Commerce of Washington State. It became an independent organization in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.densho.org/about/default.asp About Densho] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524123313/http://densho.org/about/default.asp |date=2009-05-24 }}, retrieved online: 2009-05-17&lt;/ref&gt; The annual operating budget is approximately $.5 million. Densho has a Board of Trustees with nine members and a staff of seven, led by Executive Director Tom Ikeda. Program activities are supported by over 100 volunteers and graduate student interns. Financial support is provided by foundation and government grants, corporate sponsorship of the Sushi &amp; Sake Fest fundraising event, and individual donations.

== Awards ==
Densho has received the first NPower Innovation Award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher= My Wire| date=October 23, 2005 | url=http://www.mywire.com/a/PRNewswire/NPower-Seattle-Recognizes-Densho-Winner/1068114 | title=NPower Seattle Recognizes Densho as Winner of Nonprofit Innovation Award  }}&lt;/ref&gt; for groundbreaking use of technology; the Association of King Country Historical Organization long-term project award;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher= Association for King County Historical Organizations| date=July 2007 | url=http://www.akcho.org/awardwinners.php| title=2007 Award Recipients}}&lt;/ref&gt; an American Library Association citation for online history;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=American Library Association | url=http://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/resources/selectedarticles/awards2007.cfm | title=World Class Achievement: Saluting the 2007 ALA Award Winners }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Washington State Historical Society award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Washington State Historical Society | url=http://www.washingtonhistory.org/wshs/awards.aspx | title=Washington State Historical Society Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Executive Director, Tom Ikeda, has received a Humanities Washington Award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Humanities Washington | url=http://www.humanities.org/awards/hwapastrecipient.php#ikeda | title=Past Recipients of Humanities Washington Award}}&lt;/ref&gt; for outstanding contributions to the humanities and the Japanese American Citizens League Biennium Award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation | date=August 14, 2004 | url=http://www.dot.gov/affairs/minetasp081404.htm | title=Remarks for the Honorable Norman Y.

== Activities ==
Densho's online archive contains over 700 hours of indexed and transcribed video interviews and 10,000 historic photos and documents. The website also includes free social studies curricula meeting Washington-State standards. Over 350 video interviews detail individuals' experiences at the 10 [[War Relocation Authority]] camps as well as the Justice Department and War Department detention facilities. In addition, Japanese Americans who were not detained, as well as Caucasian employees in the camps tell their stories to Densho. Prominent people such as [[Norman Mineta]], Senator [[Daniel Inouye]], [[Dale Minami]] are included in the collection, but the organization's goal is to capture life stories of diverse Japanese Americans from all walks of life. Densho continues to interview survivors of the camps and others who can describe how the forced removal and detention affected people's lives. The broader goal is to inform the public about the false basis for the mass incarceration so that a similar injustice does not affect another group.

Densho presents public education programs such as author talks, and collaborates with cultural organizations such as the [[Wing Luke Asian Museum]], the [[Museum of History and Industry]], and the Washington State Holocaust Education Resource Center. Densho assists [[oral history]] generation and preservation by other ethnic heritage and cultural organizations, such as the [[Bainbridge Island, Washington|Bainbridge Island]] Japanese American Community and the [[Japanese American National Museum]] in Los Angeles. These efforts expand and enrich Densho’s mission by drawing connections with the Japanese American experience and other little-recorded and seldom discussed stories of discrimination, racism, and stereotyping faced by many ethnic communities, both in the past and today.

Densho offers curriculum units investigating civil liberties issues. For example, the lesson "Causes of Conflict" guides students through a study of the issues of immigration via the essential question: "How do conflicts over immigration arise from labor needs and social change?" In the unit "Dig Deep," they explore the media and the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II by asking the question, "How do members of a democracy become fully informed so that they can participate responsibly and effectively?" In the unit "Constitutional Issues: Civil Liberties, Individuals, and the Common Good," students find answers to the question, "How can the United States balance the rights of individuals with the common good?" Densho's education efforts encourage students' critical thinking and respect for everyone's civil liberties.

[[File:Rodrigues-republica-mab.jpg|right|thumb|220px|''A República'', allegoric painting of the Brazilian republic by [[Manoel Lopes Rodrigues]], 1896.]]
The '''''Efígie da República''''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for '''[[Effigy]] of the Republic''') is used as a [[national personification]], both in [[Brazil]] and in [[Portugal]], symbolizing the [[Republic]].

==Brazil==
The effigy is a representation of a young woman wearing a crown of [[Bay leaf|bay leaves]] in Roman style and a [[phrygian cap]]. It is present in [[allegory|allegoric]] paintings and [[sculptures]] displayed in government buildings throughout Brazil, and engraved on [[Brazilian real]] coins and banknotes. It was first used as a pro-Republican icon in the 19th century, inspired by [[France]]'s [[Marianne]]. After the [[History of Brazil (1889–1930)|proclamation of the Republic]] in 1889, it became an important symbol of the newly formed Republic.

==Portugal==
The Portuguese ''Efígie da República'' is represented as a young woman wearing the [[phrygian cap]], modeled after the [[Liberty]] of [[Eugène Delacroix]]' ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]''. As a national distinction, the Portuguese Republic is represented wearing green and red clothes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The ''Efígie da República'' was adopted as a Portuguese State official symbol after the [[5 October 1910 revolution]], when the Republic substituted the [[Monarchy]] in [[Portugal]]. Before that, it was used as a political symbol by the Portuguese republicans. Later, the sculpture of [[Simões de Almeida]], representing the ''Busto da República''  (Bust of the Republic), became the standard for official use. A reproduction of the Bust of the Republic had to be present, in prominence, in all public buildings and was also present, as an effigy, in the [[Portuguese escudo|escudo]] coins. It was considered by the new republican regime as a national symbol of Portugal, like the [[coat of arms of Portugal|national coat of arms]] or the [[Flag of Portugal|national flag]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Although the original intention was for the ''Efígie da República'' to become considered as the personification of the own Portuguese Nation, it never gained popularity in that role. Usually it remains seen only as the personification of the [[republic|republican regimen]], and not as a national symbol. While frequently used in the first half of the 20th century, its use today is rare.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[Image:World 1898 empires colonies territory.png|thumb|300px|Exploitation colonialism: The world in 1898; European [[empire]]s colonised the [[Americas]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and [[Oceania]].]]

'''Exploitation colonialism''' is the national [[Political economy|economic policy]] of conquering a country to [[Exploitation of labour|exploit its population as labour]] and its [[Factors of production|natural resources]] as [[raw material]]. The practice of exploitation [[colonialism]] contrasts with [[settler colonialism]], the policy of conquering a country to establish a branch of the [[metropole]] ([[motherland]]). A reason for which a country might practice exploitation colonialism is the immediate financial gain produced by the low-cost extraction of [[raw material]]s by means of a [[Indigenous peoples|native people]], usually administered by a colonial government.

The [[geopolitics]] of an [[Imperialism|Imperialist power]] determine which of these colonial practices it will follow. In the example of the [[British Empire]], colonists settled mainly in northern [[British colonization of the Americas|North America]] and in [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|Australia]], where the native populations declined due to disease and violence in the course of establishing a facsimile society of the metropole. Whereas the densely populated countries of the [[British Raj]] (1858–1947), in the Indian subcontinent, and the [[Scramble for Africa#Britain's occupation of Egypt and South Africa|British occupation of Egypt and South Africa]], as well as the island of Barbados, were ruled by a small populace of colonial administrators (colonial government) that redirected the local economies to exploitation management to supply the metropole with food, raw materials, and some finished goods.

Exploitation was often reinforced by colonial European geographers who implemented theories such as [[environmental determinism]], which suggested warmer climates produced less civilized people.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilmartin|first1=Mary|title=Key Concepts in Political Geography|date=April 2009|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd|location=UK|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories were among the scholarly canon that helped legitimize colonial activity and expansion into overseas territories.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Geographers such as [[Friedrich Ratzel]] suggested that the survival of empire relied on its ability to expand its control and influence around the world.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  By implying a correlation between colonial expansion and national success, geographers were able to produce a sense of nationalism within many European nations. Their influence created a sense of pride that was able to reassure subjects that their nation’s activity abroad was beneficial to not only them, but that their presence was necessary within the territories being occupied.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Barbados was claimed for the English in 1625 by Captain John Powell, and by the 1660s the English had come to regard Barbados as being by far and away their most highly prized possession anywhere in the New World. The island's value to England, and the enormous wealth of a minority of its English inhabitants, hinged on the relationship that had been forged during the previous twenty years between sugar and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Origins of American Slavery: Freedom and Bondage in the English Colonies|last = Wood|first = Betty|publisher = Hill and Wang|year = 1997|isbn = 0-8090-7456-7|location = New York|pages = 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''German Society for Animal Breeding''' in German: ''Deutsche Gesellschaft für Züchtungskunde e.V.'' (DGfZ) is a specialist association which sees itself as a link in the area of livestock science, in that brings together science, administration and practice (including intermediate areas) over all species of animal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agrifinder.proplanta.de/Adresse/Deutsche+Gesellschaft+für+Züchtungskunde+(DGfZ)_af1222248118.html DGfZ bei Proplata Agrifinder]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pferd-aktuell.de/pferdezucht/mitgliedsverbaende-und-anschlussorganisationen/deutsche-gesellschaft-fuer-zuechtungskunde/deutsche-gesellschaft-fuer-zuechtungskunde German Equestrian Association]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zds-bonn.de/services/files/pdf/resolutionuelzen.pdf  Association of Swine Breeders – member of DGfZ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and Structure==
The DGfZ was formed in 1905 as a non-profit organization with its seat in [[Bonn]] (Germany). It officially represents Germany at the [[European Federation of Animal Science]] (EAAP) and is thus financially sponsored by the Bundesministerium für Ernährung, Landwirtschaft und Verbraucherschutz (Federal Ministry for Nutrition, Agriculture and Consumer Protection)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juramagazin.de/VORBINDUNGEN-Der-Mitgliedsbeitrag-an-die-Deutsche-Gesellschaft-für-Züchtungskunde-ist-järlich Jura Magazine membership fee and support by the DGfZ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The official organ of the DGfZ is the journal Züchtungskunde (Breeding Science published by the  Ulmer Verlag. [5] [6][7][8]
In addition, it organises symposia, lectures and workshops at which European research results are discussed and market analysis carried out. [9]

The following working groups are active:
*the Genetic-Statistic Committee
*the Animal Genetics Advisory Board
*the Working Group for Foodstuffs of Animal Origin
*the Drafting Committee and the Editorial Staff of the journal Animal Breeding

Students of animal science are supported with stipendia and financial aid. Those who have significantly contributed to the field of animal science and veterinary medicine are honoured with the [[Hermann-von-Nathusius-Medaille|Hermann-von-Nathusius-Medal]], the Adolf-Koeppe-Badge (named after Adolf Koeppe) or with honorary  membership of the DGfZ.[10][11]

were a [[nationalist]], initially [[paramilitary]] group operating within [[Austria]] during the 1920s and 1930s; they were similar in methods, organisation, and ideology to Germany's [[Freikorps]]. Although opposed to parliamentary democracy, the Heimwehr maintained a political wing known as the '''Heimatblock''', which cooperated with [[Engelbert Dollfuss]]' conservative government. In 1936, the Heimwehr was absorbed into the [[Fatherland Front (Austria)|Fatherland Front]] by decree of Chancellor [[Kurt von Schuschnigg]] and replaced by a militia supposedly less inclined towards uproar against the regime, the ''Frontmiliz''.

==Origins and reorganization==
[[File:Engelbert Dollfuss.png|thumb|upright|Austrian Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuß]] wearing the ''Heimwehr'' uniform (1933)]]
Formed mainly from demobilised soldiers after [[World War I]], the Heimwehr were initially formed as loosely organized militias to defend the borders of Austria. As with Germany's Freikorps, there was no formal national leadership or political program at the beginning, but rather local groupings which responded actively to whatever they considered to be ideologically unpalatable. In [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], for example, they formed to protect their region from [[Slovenes|Slovene]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

in an attempt to curb socialist power. The increasing politicalization of militias led to the Heimwehr involvement in helping the police suppress the [[July Revolt of 1927]].

The most distinctive part of the ''Heimwehren'' uniforms was a green loden hat with the tail feather of a [[black grouse]] (which had earlier been the Symbol of the [[County of Tyrol|Tyrolean]] ''[[Kaiserschützen]]''). Therefore, ''Heimwehr'' fighters were ridiculed by their opponents as "rooster tails" ''(Hahnenschwanzler)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Peter |last=Diem |title=Die Symbole Österreichs: Zeit und Geschichte in Zeichen |publisher=Kremayr &amp; Scheriau |year=1995 |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1930s==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-10358, Führer der österreichischen Heimwehren.jpg|thumb|left|Heimwehr leader Richard Steidle (centre), Baron Hans von Pranckh (right) and Baron von Bachofen-Echt (left), September 1930]]
The Heimwehr continued to lack any real national coherence up to 1930, when Heimwehr leaders committed themselves to the [[Korneuburg Oath]], which established an Austrian conservative nationalism base (as distinct from the pan-German nationalism of the [[Nazi Party]]), a rejection of [[liberal democracy]] and [[Marxism]], in favour of a more autocratic government, and a rejection of "class struggle" (''see'' [[Austrofascism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Bosworth, ''The Oxford Handbook of Fascism'', Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 439&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Walter Pfrimer]], regional head in [[Styria]] attempted a coup in 1931, he received no support from other Heimwehr leaders. After this, many Heimwehr groupings, including the Styrian section, increasingly defected to the Nazi Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Martina |last=Aicher |chapter=Heimwehren (Österreich) |title=Organisationen, Institutionen, Bewegungen |series=Handbuch des Antisemitismus |volume=5 |publisher=de Gruyter |year=2012 |page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tensions continued between Austrian section of the Nazi Party, who believed in a pan-Germanic state, which would bring Austria into a Greater German Empire and the Heimwehr, who believed that Austria should remain an independent nation. This led to low level violence, including one incident where Nazi Party members attacked a Heimwehr march with eggs.&lt;ref&gt;Milwaukee Sentinel, May 15, 1933 https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OE5QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OA0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=waukesha%20county&amp;pg=3070%2C2306546&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
After [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] created the [[Fatherland Front (Austria)|Fatherland Front]] in 1934, he gained control over and incorporated the Heimwehr into other right-wing militaries with the help of Heimwehr leader [[Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg]]. Politically, the Heimwehr suffered a decline in support and significance due to the pan-German, nationalist allure of the Nazis and Italy's gradual reorientation of its foreign policy towards Germany.  As a result of these factors, Dollfuss' successor, [[Kurt Schuschnigg]], absorbed the remaining Heimwehr elements into the Fatherland Front in 1936, and it ceased to exist as a political grouping. Ernst Starhemberg was left out of the new governmental order in an attempt to end rivalries between private armies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,756104-1,00.html|title= Mother's Helper|accessdate=December 11, 2007 |author= |date=15 May 1936 |publisher=[[Time Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]]''' has been part of the political scene in the [[Republic of Ireland]] throughout that state's existence. Although never attracting majority support, it has repeatedly participated in [[coalition]] governments.

The party was established in 1912 by [[James Connolly]] [[James Larkin]], and [[William X. O'Brien]] and others as the political wing of the [[Irish Trade Union Congress]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://centenaries-ituc.nationalarchives.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/19th-annual-report-1912.pdf|title = Annual Report | publisher = Irish Trade Union Congress | year = 1912 | page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It intended to participate in a Dublin Parliament that would follow passage of the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Home Rule Act 1914]], which was suspended on the outbreak of World War I. Connolly was executed following the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916, and was succeeded as leader by [[Thomas Johnson (Irish politician)|Thomas Johnson]]. The party stood aside from the elections of [[Irish (UK) general election, 1918|1918]] and [[Irish elections, 1921|1921]], but despite divisions over acceptance of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] it did well in the [[Irish general election, 1922|1922 elections]], initially forming the main [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] party in the [[Dáil Éireann]] (parliament) of the [[Irish Free State]].

The subsequent years were marked by rivalry between factions led by [[William X. O'Brien]] and [[James Larkin]], with [[William Norton]] becoming leader. Between 1932 and 1938 the Labour Party supported [[Éamon de Valera]]'s minority [[Fianna Fáil]] government. From 1948–1951 and from 1954–1957 the Labour Party entered government alongside [[Fine Gael]] and other parties, with Norton as [[Tánaiste]]. During this period the party also stood for elections in [[Northern Ireland]], after a split in the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]]. In 1960 [[Brendan Corish]] became the new Labour leader. As leader he advocated and introduced more socialist policies to the party. Between 1973 and 1987 Labour three times more went into coalition governments with [[Fine Gael]]. [[Dick Spring]] became leader in 1982, amid growing controversy within the party over these coalitions and the growth of parties to the left of Labour.

In 1990 [[Mary Robinson]] became [[President of Ireland]] with Labour support. After mergers with the [[Democratic Socialist Party (Ireland)|Democratic Socialist Party]] and the Independent Socialist Party, Labour performed well in the [[Irish general election, 1992|1992 general election]] and formed a coalition with Fianna Fáil, with Spring as Tánaiste, then in 1994 without a further election joined a coalition with Fine Gael and [[Democratic Left (Ireland)|Democratic Left]] (the “[[24th Government of Ireland|Rainbow Coalition]]”).  After defeat in the [[Irish general election, 1997|1997 general election]], Labour merged with Democratic Left, and the former Democratic Left member [[Pat Rabbitte]] became leader in 2002. Rabbitte implemented the “Mullingar Accord”, a pre-election voting pact with Fine Gael, but this did not lead to greater election success for Labour in the [[Irish general election, 2007|2007 elections]], and Rabbitte resigned to be replaced by [[Eamon Gilmore]]. The [[Irish general election, 2011|2011 general election]] saw one of Labour's best results, with over 19% of the first-preference votes. Labour once more entered a [[Government of the 31st Dáil|coalition government]] with Fine Gael, and the [[Irish presidential election, 2011|Irish presidential election]] later that year saw the Labour Party's candidate, [[Michael D. Higgins]],  elected as President. However, Labour in government experienced a series of dismissals and resignations among its members in the Dáil. In 2014, Gilmore resigned as party leader after Labour's poor performance in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Ireland)|European]] and [[Irish local elections, 2014|local elections]], and [[Joan Burton]] was elected as the new leader.

==Foundation==
[[File:Such Meeting or Assemblage is seditious... (9621476054).jpg|thumb|Proclamation banning a public meeting called by [[James Larkin]] in [[Sackville Street (Dublin)|Sackville Street]], Dublin, August 1913]] 
In the first decade of the twentieth century, considerable debate took place within the [[Irish Trade Union Congress]] on whether the organised trade union movement in Ireland should take part in political activity. [[James Connolly]], and [[James Larkin]] as the leaders of the new and dynamic [[Irish Transport and General Workers Union]] (ITGWU), led the calls for political action and representation for trade unionists. Opposition came from northern trade unionists and others who wanted links with the [[British Labour Party]], and from supporters of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]].

The catalyst for the launch of a congress-sponsored party was the introduction and successful progress of the [[Third Home Rule Bill]] in 1912. At its meeting in [[Clonmel]] in 1912, the congress took up the question of a political party. James Connolly presented the resolution that the congress establish its own party. He argued that since [[Home Rule]] was imminent and would take place once the [[House of Lords]]' delaying powers were exhausted in two years' time, that this period should be used to organise the new party. Connolly's resolution was carried by a wide margin with 49 voting for; 19 against; and 19 abstaining.

The congress also supported the introduction of salaries for members of parliament, public funding of elections and [[female suffrage]]. The founding of the Labour Party was disrupted by personality differences between Larkin and his fellow leaders, including Connolly. Nevertheless, the 1913 congress meeting under William O'Brien's chairmanship instructed the executive to proceed with the writing of a party constitution.

The proposed constitution limited party membership to affiliated trade unions and councils only and excluded individual membership and other involvement, such as by co-operative societies and socialist groups. [[Thomas Johnson (Irish politician)|Thomas Johnson]] argued that Labour would be "swamped" by farmer co-operatives and that individuals might join through trade councils. Connolly argued that there should be just one body and that a separate Labour Party as in Britain would encourage the "professional politician". The ITUC decided to add "and Labour Party" to its name and became the Irish Trade Union Congress and Labour Party (ITUC and LP). At the 1914 Congress, it was agreed for the first time to seek the reconstruction of society: "the Congress urges that labour unrest can only be ended by the abolition of the capitalist system of wealth production with its inherent injustice and poverty." Curiously, the ITUC and LP took no part in the [[Dublin Lock-out|1913 lock-out]] struggle in Dublin, and Labour did poorly in local elections in Dublin in January 1914.

The ITUC and LP was seriously troubled by the proposals in 1914 to exclude certain [[Ulster]] counties from Home Rule as this would undermine the potential of the new party by excluding the substantial industrial areas of north east Ulster. Fourteen of the 34 urban seats in the Home Rule parliament were to be in Belfast alone. The start of the First World War in the summer of 1914 transformed the political situation in Ireland. The Home Rule Bill became law but its operation was postponed until after the war. The official Labour position did not directly oppose Irish support for the British war effort, but it was critical of the war in general terms. Labour skirted the issue in an attempt to avoid division between unionist and nationalist trade unionists. Larkin opposed the war before he left for the USA and Connolly condemned [[John Redmond]]'s support for Irish nationalists involvement in army recruitment. Gradually, Labour opposition to the spectre of conscription moved the party's position closer to that of the separatists. To avoid making a decision on the war, Labour called off its congress in 1915.

James Connolly was the only leading Labour figure to take part in the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916. His execution after the rebellion left the labour movement in some disarray. [[Liberty Hall]], the physical symbol of the labour movement, was destroyed, and the files of the ITUCLP were seized. Many trade union leaders, in Dublin, who had not taken part in the Rising were interned, such as William O'Brien, but they were released later when the British realised that they had no direct involvement. Their absence allowed non-nationalist leaders to come to the fore, especially Thomas Johnson, who was not charismatic, but was a moderate and hardworking man.

Despite his English background, his sheer diligence and devotion to his duties gave him the leading position in labour politics for the next decade. He managed to persuade the authorities to release the trade union leaders in time for the congress meeting in Sligo in August 1916. In his chairman's address, Johnson avoided taking a stand on the Rising and instead called for a minute's silence to honour the memory of Connolly and his comrades. He mourned the dead in the trenches and expressed personal support for the Allies. Johnson's stance in refusing to accept any responsibility for the Rising was regarded as a success as it avoided division between north and south, and laid the stress on economic and social issues.

==Early history==
In Larkin's absence and Connolly's demise, [[William X. O'Brien]] became the dominant figure in the [[Irish Transport and General Workers' Union]] joining it in January 1917, and quickly becoming the leader of that union and wielding considerable influence in the Labour Party. O'Brien, along with Johnson, also dominated the Irish Trade Union Congress and Labour Party. O'Brien took a leading role in the growing separatist movement that would become the revitalised [[Sinn Féin]]. The Labour Party, now led by [[Thomas Johnson (Irish politician)|Thomas Johnson]], as successor to such organisations as [[D.D. Sheehan]]'s (independent labour MPs) [[Irish Land and Labour Association]] (ILLA), found itself marginalised by the preeminence that Sinn Féin gave to the national question. De Valera and others expressed sympathy for the labour movement's objectives but made clear that Labour must wait. The congress-party strongly opposed the moves to introduce conscription into Ireland in 1918, and a twenty-four-hour strike was successfully called on 23 April 1918. Only the Belfast area ignored the strike call. That spring, Labour announced that it would take part in the General Election to be held immediately after the war ended. De Valera and other Sinn Féin leaders were highly critical of what they saw as a divisive step by the ITUCLP. At the congress held in August 1918, the executive reported that Labour's hour of destiny had struck and it found the movement ready. O'Brien urged the development of electoral machinery. At this moment, the first signs of the split between O'Brien and the Larkinites became evident. PT Daly, the protégé of Larkin, was locked in a struggle with O'Brien and was beaten by 114 votes to 109 for the post of secretary of the Congress. Daly was later to be purged by O'Brien from the leadership of the ITGWU, setting the scene for a long-lasting split in Irish trade unionism. Following the congress, Labour was finally forced to deal with the issues of national self-determination and abstention from parliament.

Sinn Féin entered into discussions with Labour to secure its abstention from the forthcoming election. Labour was again faced with the dilemma that it might win some seats by entering into a pact with Sinn Féin at the price of alienation of northern unionist workers. Labour offered a radical election programme. Among other objectives, it declared that it would win for the workers the collective ownership and control of the whole produce of their work; adopt the principles of the Russian Revolution; secure the democratic management of all industries in the interest of the nation; and abolish all privileges which were based on property or ancestry.

In the end, a special party conference voted by 96 votes to 23 that the ITUCLP would not contest the 1918 [[Irish (UK) general election, 1918|general election]], to allow the election to take the form of a plebiscite on Ireland's constitutional status. Sinn Féin went on to gain 73 of the 105 seats in the General Election and convened the First Dáil in January 1919. The Democratic Programme of the [[First Dáil]] was jointly drafted by [[Seán T. O'Kelly]] of Sinn Féin and Thomas Johnson of Labour. Despite being eventually pruned of much of its socialist content, some of the original radical elements survived. Sinn Féin paid its debt of honour to the Labour Party for its abstention by including in the Programme that every citizen was to be entitled to an adequate share of the produce of the nation's labour; the government would concern itself with the welfare of children, and would care for the aged and infirm; and it would seek "a general and lasting improvement in the conditions under which the working classes live and labour".

Labour took part in the [[Irish local elections, 1920|1920 local elections]] and won a significant role in local government for the first time. It gained 394 seats compared to 550 for Sinn Féin, 355 for the unionists, 238 for the old nationalists, and 161 independents.

In 1921, the ITUCLP again agreed with Sinn Féin that it would not take part in the election for the new Southern Ireland parliament envisaged by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920. This left the field clear for Sinn Féin to treat these elections as the election to the [[Second Dáil]]. As a result of these decisions, the party was absent from the [[Dáil]] during the vital years of the independence struggle. Following the Truce of July 1921, Labour was not involved in any way in the negotiations that led to the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of December 1921, by which a new [[Irish Free State]] would be established as a Dominion of the British Empire equivalent in status to Canada.

==Labour in the Irish Free State==
The [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] divided the Labour party. It did not take an official stand. From his American prison cell, [[Jim Larkin]] opposed the Treaty while the only Labour member of the Dáil, [[Richard Corish]] of Wexford spoke and voted for the Treaty. Johnson, never a republican, privately supported the Treaty, while O'Brien did not oppose it. Following the approval of the Treaty by the Dáil in January 1922, the executive of the ITUCLP succeeded at a special conference held in February, in passing a motion to participate in the forthcoming General Election. Successful Labour candidates were required to take their seats in the new Free State Dáil, and a reformist programme was adopted.

Johnson and the other Labour leaders tried to stop the slide to civil war to no avail, including holding a one-day national strike across the 26 counties on 24 April. Labour candidates were nominated for the election on 16 June, despite the difficulties of poor organisation, internal opposition to participation and limited finance. When The Collins/De Valera Pact was agreed on 20 May, the pressure on the party was intensified. The Pact provided for the pro and anti Treaty sides to have one agreed slate of candidates with a coalition government to be established afterwards. Other parties and groups, including Labour, were asked to stand down again in the national interest. Effectively, the old Sinn Féin was about to deny a democratic election from being held and to prevent the public expressing their preferences. While de Valera had a notable success in persuading [[Patrick Hogan (Ceann Comhairle)|Patrick Hogan]], a future Labour Ceann Comhairle, from standing in Clare, 18 other Labour candidates resisted the pressures on them from the IRA and went forward for election. These were perceived as pro-Treaty, and when [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] repudiated the Pact four days before the election, it benefited the Labour Party as well as the pro-Treaty party. Seventeen of the eighteen Labour candidates won seats, with the 18th losing only by 13 votes. Some candidates had nearly twice the quota but had no running mates to transfer their surplus votes.

As well as being a triumph for the Labour Party, the election confirmed the popular acceptance of the Treaty. The Civil War broke out shortly later, between the IRA and the new National Army, and ravaged the country in the following months. The new Dáil did not meet until September preventing Labour from having any influence over events. Public opinion and voting habits crystallised in a deeply polarised fashion in this period between the two sides of the national movement, and led to the effective marginalisation of the Labour Party and of social and economic issues that was to last for the rest of the twentieth century.

When the third Dáil eventually met in September, Labour attempted to amend the new Free State Constitution to remove the elements imposed by the Treaty but pragmatically accepted the new order when it was adopted. The Labour deputies took the controversial oath of fidelity to the British monarch, viewing it as a formality.

In the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, an economic slump and collapse in union membership led to a loss in support for the party. In the 1923 election Labour only won 14 seats. However, from 1922 until [[Fianna Fáil]] [[Teachta Dála|TD]]s took their seats in 1927, Labour was the major opposition party in the [[Dáil]]. It attacked the lack of social reform by the [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] government. Johnson became the leading figure in the Parliamentary Labour Party and the leader of the Opposition to the new Government.

In 1923 Larkin returned to Ireland. He hoped to take over the leadership role he had left, but O'Brien resisted him. Larkin sided with the more radical elements of the party and in September that year he established the [[Irish Worker League]].

In 1932 the Labour Party supported [[Éamon de Valera]]'s first Fianna Fáil government, which had proposed a programme of social reform with which the party was in sympathy. In the 1940s it looked for a while as if Labour would replace [[Fine Gael]] as the main opposition party. In the 1943 general election the party won 17 seats, its best result since 1927. But further aspirations were disappointed as the party was damaged by internal division for the remainderof the decade.

==The split with National Labour and the first coalition governments==
The Larkin-O'Brien feud still continued, and worsened over time. In the 1940s the hatred caused a split in the Labour party and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. In 1944 O'Brien left and founded the [[National Labour Party (Ireland)|National Labour Party]]. O'Brien also withdrew the ITGWU from the Irish Trade Unions Congress and set up his own congress. The split damaged the Labour movement in the 1944 general election. It was only after Larkin's death in 1947 that an attempt at unity could be made.

During this period the party also occasionally stood for election in [[Northern Ireland]], on occasion winning the odd seat at both the [[Westminster Parliament]] and [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont Parliament]] in the [[Belfast]] area. However the party is not known to have contested an election in the region since [[Gerry Fitt]], then the party's sole Stormont MP, left the party to form the [[Republican Labour Party]] in 1964.

From 1948–1951 and from 1954–1957 the Labour Party was the second-largest partner in the two inter-party governments. [[William Norton]], the Labour leader, became [[Tánaiste]] and Minister for Social Welfare on both occasions.

==Labour under Brendan Corish, 1960 – 1977==
In 1960 [[Brendan Corish]] became the new Labour leader. As leader he advocated and introduced more socialist policies to the party. Between 1973 and 1977 the Labour Party formed a coalition government with [[Fine Gael]]. The coalition partners lost the subsequent election in 1977. Corish resigned immediately after the defeat.

==The 1980s: coalition, internal feuding, electoral decline and regrowth==
From 1981 to 1982 and from 1982 to 1987, Labour participated in coalition governments with [[Fine Gael]]. In the later part of the second of these coalition terms, the country's poor economic and fiscal situation required strict curtailing of government spending, and Labour bore much of the blame for unpopular cutbacks in health and other social services. In the [[Irish general election, 1987|1987 general election]] it received only 6.4% of the vote, and its vote was increasingly threatened by the growth of the [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]]. Fianna Fáil formed a minority government from 1987 to 1989 and then a coalition with the [[Progressive Democrats]].

The 1980s saw fierce disagreements between left and right wings of the party. The more radical elements, led by figures including [[Emmet Stagg]], opposed the idea of going into coalition government with either of the major centre-right parties. At the 1989 Labour conference in [[Tralee]] a number of socialist and Marxist activists, organised around the [[Militant (Ireland)|Militant]] newspaper, were expelled. These expulsions continued during the early 1990s and those expelled, including [[Joe Higgins]] went on to found the [[Socialist Party (Ireland)|Socialist Party]].

These rows ended with the defeat of the anti-coalition left. In the period since, there have been further discussions about coalitions in the Party but these disagreements have primarily been over the merits of different coalition partners rather than over the principle of coalition. Related arguments have taken place from time to time over the wisdom of entering into pre-election voting pacts with other parties. Indeed, former radicals like Stagg himself and [[Michael D. Higgins]] now themselves support coalition.

==Mary Robinson and coalitions of different hues==
In 1990 [[Mary Robinson]] became the first [[President of Ireland]] to have been proposed by the Labour Party, although she contested the election as an independent candidate. Not only was it the first time a woman held the office but it was the first time, apart from [[Douglas Hyde]], that a non-[[Fianna Fáil]] candidate was elected. [[Mary Robinson]] became one of the most outspoken and active presidents in the history of the state. In 1990 the Party merged with the [[Limerick East (Dáil constituency)|Limerick East]] TD [[Jim Kemmy]]'s [[Democratic Socialist Party (Ireland)|Democratic Socialist Party]] and in 1992 it merged with [[Sligo–Leitrim (Dáil constituency)|Sligo–Leitrim]] TD [[Declan Bree]]'s Independent Socialist Party.

At the [[Irish general election, 1992|1992 general election]] on 25 November Labour won a record 19.3% of the first-preference votes, more than twice its share in the [[Irish general election, 1989|1989 election]]. The party's representation in [[Dáil Éireann|the Dáil]] doubled to 33 seats and, after a period of negotiations, Labour formed a coalition with [[Fianna Fáil]], taking office in January 1993 as the [[23rd Government of Ireland]]. Fianna Fáil leader [[Albert Reynolds]] remained as [[Taoiseach]], and Labour leader [[Dick Spring]] became [[Tánaiste]] and [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Minister for Foreign Affairs]].

After less than two years the government fell in a controversy over the appointment of [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]], [[Harry Whelehan]], as president of the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]]. The parliamentary arithmetic had changed as a result of Fianna Fáil's loss of two seats in [[List of Dáil by-elections#27th Dail|by-elections in June]] and Labour negotiated a new coalition, the first time in Irish political history that one coalition replaced another without a general election. Between 1994 and 1997 [[Fine Gael]], the Labour Party, and [[Democratic Left (Ireland)|Democratic Left]] governed in the so-called [[24th Government of Ireland|Rainbow Coalition]]. [[Dick Spring]] of Labour became [[Tánaiste]] and Minister for Foreign Affairs again.

==Merger with Democratic Left and recent electoral performance==
Labour presented the 1997 election, held just weeks after spectacular victories for the French [[Socialist Party (France)|Parti Socialiste]] and Tony Blair's [[New Labour]], as the first ever choice between a government of the left and one of the right, but the party, as had often been the case following its participation in coalitions, lost support and failed to retain half of its Dáil seats. A poor performance by Labour candidate [[Adi Roche]] in the subsequent election for [[President of Ireland]] led to Spring's resignation as party leader.

In 1997 [[Ruairi Quinn]] became the new Labour leader. Negotiations started almost immediately and in 1999 the Labour Party merged with Democratic Left, keeping the name of the larger partner.

Quinn resigned as leader in 2002 following the poor results for the Labour Party in the general election, when the Labour Party was returned with only 21 seats, the same number of seats as it had held before that General Election. Former Democratic Left [[Teachta Dála|TD]] [[Pat Rabbitte]] became the new leader, the first to be elected directly by the members of the party.

In the June 2004 elections to the [[European Parliament]], [[Proinsias De Rossa]] retained his seat for Labour in the [[Dublin]] constituency. This was Labour's only success in the election.

==Pat Rabbitte and the Mullingar Accord== &lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:paulendapatemmet.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Labour has entered into a pre-election pact with the Fine Gael party. The decision was taken at party conference in Tralee, in 2005, and hugely endorsed by party delegates]] --&gt;
[[File:Pat Rabbitte, Michael D Higgins, Derek Nolan.jpg|thumb|Politicians [[Pat Rabbitte]], [[Michael D Higgins]] and [[Derek Nolan]] of the Irish Labour Party in 2010]]

Following the 2005 endorsement, by the Labour Party conference in [[Tralee]], of a pre-election voting transfer pact with the Fine Gael party in 2005, the party saw increased co-operation between the party leaders, Pat Rabbitte and the Fine Gael leader, [[Enda Kenny]], as well as the party's front benches.

Following on from the Mullingar Accord, an election pact preceding the 2004 Local and European elections, where Fine Gael benefited largely, a number of mutually acceptable and compatible policy documents were published in the lead up to the elections. The two parties formed the "Alliance for Change" in the run up to the election and pursued joint policies and economic constings in major policy areas. However though [[Fine Gael]] gained 20 seats in the election in 2007, Labour's vote continued to stagnate at 10.13%, a marginal decline from 2002 and it returned with 20 seats, one less than before.

Rabbitte resigned as leader in August 2007, a year ahead of his six-year term came to an end. [[Éamon Gilmore]], Deputy for Dún Laoghaire replaced Rabbitte, and expressed a preference for an independent strategy, emphasising the need for Labour to concentrate on itself, rather than following media interest in its alliance with other parties.

Incomes policies have often been resorted to during wartime. During the [[French Revolution]], [[General maximum|"The Law of the Maximum"]] imposed price controls (by penalty of death) in an unsuccessful attempt to curb inflation,&lt;ref name="gmu"&gt;

The wage and price controls were effective initially but were made less restrictive in January 1973, and later removed when they seemed to be having no effect on curbing inflation.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;

==Theory==
Incomes policies vary from "voluntary" wage and price guidelines to mandatory controls like price/wage freezes. One variant is "tax-based incomes policies" (TIPs), where a government fee is imposed on those firms that raise prices and/or wages more than the controls allow.

Some economists agree that a credible incomes policy would help prevent inflation. However, by arbitrarily interfering with [[price signal]]s, it  provides an additional bar to achieving [[economic efficiency]], potentially leading to [[shortage]]s and declines in the quality of goods on the market and requiring large government [[bureaucracy|bureaucracies]] for enforcement. That happened in the United States during the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt; When the price of a good is lowered artificially, it creates less supply and more demand for the product, thereby creating shortages.&lt;ref name="argmax"&gt;

Some economists argue that incomes policies are less expensive (more efficient) than [[recession]]s as a way of fighting inflation, at least for mild inflation. Others argue that controls and mild recessions can be complementary solutions for relatively mild inflation.

The policy has the best chance of being credible and effective{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} for the sectors of the economy dominated by [[monopoly|monopolies]] or [[oligopoly|oligopolies]], particularly [[nationalization|nationalised industry]], with a significant sector of workers organized in [[labor unions]]. Such institutions enable collective negotiation and monitoring of the wage and price agreements.

Other economists argue that inflation is essentially a [[monetary]] phenomenon, and the only way to deal with it is by controlling the [[money supply]], directly or by changing [[interest rate]]s. They argue that price inflation is only a symptom of previous [[monetary inflation]] caused by [[central bank]] [[money creation]]. They believe that without a totally [[planned economy]] the incomes policy can never work, the excess [[money]] in the economy greatly distorting other areas, exempt from the policy.

==Examples==

===France===
During the [[French Revolution]] in the 1790s, [[General maximum|"The Law of the Maximum"]] was imposed in an attempt to decrease inflation. It consisted of limits on wages and food prices.&lt;ref name="gmu"/&gt; Many dissidents were [[guillotine|executed]] for breaking this law.&lt;ref name="fiat money"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was repealed 14 months after its introduction.&lt;ref name="fiat money"/&gt;

By turning the crimes of [[price gouging]] and food hoarding into crimes against the government, [[France]] had limited success.  With respect to its overt intention, that of ensuring the people were able to purchase food at a reasonable rate, the Maximum was mostly a failure.  Some merchants having found themselves forced into a position to sell their goods for a price lower than what it cost to create it (i.e. cost of baking [[bread]], growing [[vegetable]]s, etc.,)  chose to hide their expensive goods from the market, either for personal use or for sale on the [[black market]].&lt;ref&gt;Darrow, M. "Economic Terror in the City: The General Maximum in Montauban." ''French Historical Studies'' 1991, pp. 517–19&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the General Maximum was very successful in deflecting a volatile political issue away from the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]], enabling them to focus on larger political issues more closely related to completing the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Darrow, M. "Economic Terror in the City: The General Maximum in Montauban." ''French Historical Studies'' 1991, pp. 523–25&lt;/ref&gt;

In creating the General Maximum, [[Maximilien Robespierre]] shifted the attention of the French people away from government involvement in widespread shortages of money and food to a fight between consumers and merchants.  The text of the General Maximum was written towards businessmen who were profiting on a large scale from the demise of the French economy.  However, in practice, the law ultimately targeted local shopkeepers, butchers, bakers, and farmers-the merchants who were profiting the least from the economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Darrow, M. "Economic Terror in the City: The General Maximum in Montauban." ''French Historical Studies'' 1991, pp. 503–05&lt;/ref&gt;  With the General Maximum, [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] offered the people an answer regarding whom to blame for their poverty and their hunger. Furthermore, considering its association with the [[Law of Suspects]], when a citizen informed the government about a merchant who was in violation of the law, they were considered to have done their civic duty.&lt;ref&gt;Darrow, M. "Economic Terror in the City: The General Maximum in Montauban." ''French Historical Studies'' 1991, p. 511&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
During [[World War II]], price controls were used in an attempt to control wartime inflation. The [[Franklin Roosevelt Administration]] instituted the OPA ([[Office of Price Administration]]). That agency was rather unpopular with business interests and was phased out as quickly as possible after peace had been restored. However, the [[Korean War]] brought a return to the same inflationary pressures, and price controls were again established, this time under the OPS ([[Office of Price Stabilization]]).

In the early 1970s, inflation had been much higher than in previous decades, getting above 6% briefly in 1970 and persisting above 4% in 1971. U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] imposed price controls on August 15, 1971.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt; This was a move widely applauded by the public&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt; and a number of Keynesian economists.&lt;ref name="'70s 298"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= |pages= 298–99|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 90-day freeze was unprecedented in peacetime, but such drastic measures were thought necessary. Also motivating the controls, on the same date that the controls were imposed, 15 August 1971, Nixon also suspended the convertibility of the dollar into gold, which was the beginning of the end of the [[Bretton Woods system]] of international currency management established after World War II.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt; It was quite well known at the time that this would likely lead to an immediate inflationary impulse (essentially because the subsequent [[depreciation]] of the dollar would boost the demand for exports and increase the cost of imports). The controls aimed to stop that impulse. The fact that the election of 1972 was on the horizon likely contributed to both Nixon's application of controls and his ending of the convertibility of the dollar.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;

The 90-day freeze became nearly 1,000 days of measures known as Phases One, Two, Three, and Four,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=3868 Richard Nixon speech announcing Phase Four price controls, June 13th, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; ending in 1973. In these phases, the controls were applied almost entirely to the biggest corporations and labor unions, which were seen as having price-setting power.&lt;ref name="'70s 298"/&gt;  However, 93% of requested price increases were granted and seen as necessary to meet costs.&lt;ref name="'70s 298"/&gt;  With such [[monopoly]] power, some economists saw controls as possibly working effectively (though they are usually skeptical on the issue of controls). Because controls of this sort can calm inflationary expectations, this was seen as a serious blow against [[stagflation]].

The first wave of controls were successful at curbing inflation temporarily while the administration used expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/07/opinion/the-nixon-recovery.html|title=The Nixon Recovery|first=Charles R.|last=Morris|date=7 February 2004|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richard M.

Left unsuppressed after the initial price controls were relaxed, the overly expansionary policies proceeded to exacerbate inflationary pressures.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richard M. Nixon"/&gt; Meat also began disappearing from grocery store shelves and Americans protested wage controls that didn't allow wages to keep up with inflation.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;

Since that time, the U.S. government has not imposed maximum prices on consumer items or labor (although the cap on [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] prices persisted for years after 1973).&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt; During times of high inflation, controls have been called for; in 1980 during unprecedented inflation, ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' editorialized in favor of semi-permanent wage and price controls.&lt;ref name="'70s 292"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= 292|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
[[File:Labour Demonstration against wage controls, Parliament Hill, 1942.jpg|thumb|250px|Demonstration against wage controls during [[World War II]] on [[Parliament Hill]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]]]]
During the 1974 federal election, Progressive Conservative Party leader [[Robert Stanfield]] proposed the imposition of a wage and price freeze on the Canadian economy as a response to rising inflation due to the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]]. The Liberal government under [[Pierre Trudeau]] was originally opposed to this idea, but after winning the election, introduced the [[Anti-Inflation Act]] in 1975. This act contained wage and price controls on parts of the economy and remained in force until 1978. In 1979 the anti-inflation board was dissolved and the Anti-Inflation Act repealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wage &amp; Price Controls|url=http://www.canadahistory.com/sections/eras/trudeau/wage_&amp;_price_controls.htm|work=The History Project|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{main|National Board for Prices and Incomes}}
The [[National Board for Prices and Incomes]] was created by the government of Harold Wilson in 1965 in an attempt to solve the problem of inflation in the British economy by managing wages and prices.
The [[James Callaghan|Callaghan]] government in the United Kingdom in the 1970s sought to reduce conflict over wages and prices through a "[[Social Contract (Britain)|social contract]]" in which unions would accept smaller wage increases, and business would constrain price increases, imitating Nixon's policy in America.&lt;ref name="'70s 313"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= 313|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Price controls ended with the election of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1979.

===Australia===
Australia implemented an incomes policy, called the [[Prices and Incomes Accord]] during the 1980s. The Accord was an agreement between trade unions and the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government. Employers were not party to the Accord. Unions agreed to restrict wage demands, and the government pledged action to minimise inflation and price rises. The government was also to act on the social wage. At its broadest this concept included increased spending on education as well as welfare.

Inflation declined during the period of the Accord, which was renegotiated several times. However, many of the key elements of the Accord were weakened over time, as  unions sought a shift from centralised wage fixation to [[enterprise bargaining]]. The Accord ceased to play a major role after the recession of 1989–92, and was abandoned after the Labor government was defeated in 1996.

===Italy===
Italy imitated the United States' price and wage controls in 1971, but soon gave up the policy to focus on controlling the price of oil.&lt;ref name="'70s 313"/&gt;

===The Netherlands and Belgium===
The [[polder model]] in the Netherlands is characterized by tri-partite cooperation between [[employers' organization]]s such as [[VNO-NCW]], [[labour union]]s such as the [[Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging|FNV]], and the [[government]]. These talks are embodied in the [[Social Economic Council]] (Dutch: Sociaal-Economische Raad, SER). The SER serves as the central forum to discuss labour issues and has a long tradition of consensus, often defusing labour conflicts and avoiding strikes. Similar models are in use in [[Finland]], namely [[Comprehensive Income Policy Agreement]] and [[universal validity of collective labour agreements]].

The current polder model is said to have begun with the Wassenaar Accords of 1982 when unions, employers and government decided on a comprehensive plan to revitalize the economy involving shorter working times and less pay on the one hand, and more employment on the other.

The polder model is widely, but not universally, regarded as successful incomes management policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eid.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/28/3/317]&lt;/ref&gt;

This model is also used in [[Belgium]], hence its name (the "polders" are a region comprising the Netherlands and the northern part of Belgium).

===New Zealand===
In 1982, then Prime Minister and Finance Minister [[Rob Muldoon]] imposed a simultaneous freeze on wages, prices and interest rates in an effort to curb inflation, despite public resistance. These measures were subsequently repealed by Muldoon's successor [[David Lange]] and Finance Minister [[Roger Douglas]].

===Zimbabwe===
In 2007, [[Robert Mugabe]]'s government imposed a price freeze in [[Zimbabwe]] because of [[hyperinflation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IRIN Africa &amp;#124; ZIMBABWE: Price controls devastating rural economy &amp;#124; Zimbabwe &amp;#124; Food Security|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/73391/zimbabwe-price-controls-devastating-rural-economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That policy led only to shortages.

'''''Infamous Second Son''''' (stylized as '''''inFAMOUS Second Son''''') is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Sucker Punch Productions]] and published by [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony Computer Entertainment]] for [[PlayStation 4]]. It is the third installment in the [[Infamous (series)|''Infamous'' series]]. The game was released worldwide on March 21, 2014. The player-controlled protagonist possesses [[Superpower (ability)|superpower]] abilities that players use in combat and when traveling across the city. The story follows protagonist Delsin Rowe fighting the Department of Unified Protection (D.U.P.) in a fictionalized [[Seattle]]. Over the course of the game, Delsin acquires new powers and becomes either good or evil as player choices influence his morality.

Sucker Punch began planning the game as early as 2010, when they began discussion with Sony to bring the ''Infamous'' series onto a new generation of hardware. They provided feedback to Sony on what hardware evolutions they would like to see on the PlayStation 4 system. Sucker Punch considers ''Second Son'' a fresh start for the series because it features a new protagonist. Delsin Rowe's superpowers were designed to feel fluid and suited to the open world design.

''Infamous Second Son'' was met with generally positive reviews; critics praised its gameplay, dynamic combat, visuals and design, while criticism was aimed at the game's morality system, which some found to be dated and binary, as well as the game's repetitive side missions. The story was met with a mixed response, with some critics finding the narrative and characters to be a step backwards from previous installments in the series, while others viewing the writing as an improvement over its predecessors. ''Infamous Second Son'' was a commercial success, and sold over a million copies within nine days, making it the fastest-selling entry within the ''Infamous'' franchise.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Infamous Second Son gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Delsin may use his superpowers to subdue enemies rather than killing them. Players make choices like these, with Delsin's [[karma]] level consequently rising as either good or evil. |alt=The player character Delsin Rowe has just used his powers to subdue an enemy, who lays restrained on the floor with light particles that resemble chains wrapped around him. The text prompt in the upper-left hand corner reads "Enemy subdued".]]

''Infamous Second Son'' is an [[action-adventure game]] set in an [[open world]] environment and played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. Players control the main character Delsin Rowe, who can [[parkour]]-style climb vertical surfaces like high-rise buildings. Delsin is a Conduit, which allows him to use superpower abilities by manipulating materials such as smoke, neon, video, and concrete. These materials can be weaponized (such that Delsin can perform melee attacks or fire projectiles from his fingertips) or used to deftly navigate the game world (such as using neon to dash up buildings).&lt;ref name="GI-Preview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/infamous_second_son/b/playstation4/archive/2013/11/12/our-first-hands-on-with-infamous-second-son.aspx |title=Our First Hands On With Infamous: Second Son |last=Futter |first=Mike |date=November 12, 2013 |publisher=''[[Game Informer]]'' |accessdate=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/11/infamous-second-son-is-as-much-fun-to-play-as-it-is-to-watch |title=Infamous: Second Son Is as Much Fun to Play as It Is to Watch |last=Miller |first=Greg |authorlink=Greg Miller (Internet celebrity) |date=November 11, 2013 |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using powers depletes a meter in the [[head-up display]] (HUD), which can be replenished by drawing from power sources such as smoke from exploded vehicles.&lt;ref name="Art Animation Smoke"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/1/4578722/infamous-second-son-dev-diary-talks-art-animation-and-smoke |title=Infamous: Second Son dev diary talks art, animation and smoke |last=Funk |first=John |date=August 1, 2013 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delsin earns new powers as he progresses through the story, which sees him fight against the Department of Unified Protection (D.U.P.) during missions. Each time Delsin gains a new power set he must destroy D.U.P. Core Relays to learn the basic abilities that correspond to it. Delsin upgrades and acquires new abilities by spending Blast Shards that have been collected, they are scattered throughout Seattle. Players become more powerful in combat by expanding Delsin's suite of abilities.&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt;

Players may choose to act in either a good or evil way. Examples including healing civilians, doing drug busts, and stopping suspect brutality for good, or killing innocent civilians and killing instead of apprehending enemies.  Several times throughout the story, Delsin finds himself in a scenario where he must make a good or evil choice, such as whether to encourage Conduit vigilante Abigail "Fetch" Walker to stop slaying drug dealers, or to train her to become a more prolific killer. Player choices influence outcomes in some later missions.&lt;ref name="SS Dials Up"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/12/infamous-second-son-dials-up-the-action-and-the-drama |title=Infamous: Second Son Dials Up the Action and the Drama |date=February 12, 2014 |last=Ingenito |first=Vince |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In combat, Delsin may use his abilities to incapacitate foes or obliterate them with headshots. He may choose to open fire on innocent civilians. Delsin's choices manifest in a logo displayed on his jacket and the HUD, which features a blue (good) and red (evil) bird. Performing actions that are villainous gradually change the logo so that the red bird dominates the other, with the opposite happening with heroism. This is a visual representation of Delsin's [[Karma]] level, that increases as good or evil depending on his choices.&lt;ref name="Poly-Karma"/&gt; As his Karma level increases, Delsin can acquire new powers that correspond to his play-style (e.g. very destructive powers with high levels of evil Karma) and his jacket also changes. If you have good karma, the jacket completely changes white whereas if evil the jacket turns red.&lt;ref name="IGN Beauty-Details"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/09/ces-infamous-second-sons-beauty-is-in-the-details |title=CES: Infamous: Second Son's Beauty Is in Its Details |last=Sliva |first=Marty |date=January 8, 2014 |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A continual streak of either good or evil actions fills up a bar in the HUD, which then lets Delsin perform a powerful finishing move called a Karma Bomb.&lt;ref name="Poly-Karma"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/12/5402590/infamous-second-son-ps4-preview |title=Infamous: Second Son puts its karmic choices on display, but still has some secrets |last=McWhertor |first=Michael |date=February 12, 2014 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When not completing story missions, players can explore the city and complete activities such as tagging graffiti spots or assassinating D.U.P. secret agents. The city is split into districts that are all initially controlled by the D.U.P., but Delsin gradually liberates each district by completing activities. When D.U.P. control of a district falls below 30 percent, Delsin can enter a District Showdown that requires him to eliminate a wave of D.U.P. forces, eradicating D.U.P. presence there.&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt;

The [[antagonist]] is Brooke Augustine ([[Christine Dunford]]), the director of the D.U.P. and a Conduit with power over [[Concrete]]. Her actions in the Akomish reservation drive Delsin to travel to Seattle, now under lockdown by D.U.P. forces. Delsin and Reggie encounter three other Conduits: Henry "Hank" Daughtry (David Stanbra), a [[convict]] with control over [[Smoke]]; Abigail "Fetch" Walker ([[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]]), an ex-[[wikt:junkie|junkie]] who uses her [[Neon]] powers to hunt down the [[illegal drug trade|illegal drug dealer]]s in Seattle; and Eugene Sims (Alex Walsh), a [[Recluse|reclusive]] [[video gamer]] who uses his Video ([[digital materialization]]) powers to save suspected Conduits from the D.U.P.

=== Story ===
After Reggie catches Delsin vandalizing a billboard, their subsequent argument is interrupted when a military truck carrying three Conduit prisoners crashes on the Akomish reservation.&lt;ref name="argument1"/&gt; Two of the Conduits escape, but Delsin manages to pull the third one, Hank, out of the wreckage, and inadvertently absorb his smoke powers.

They reach Seattle and find that it has been put under strict [[martial law]] by the D.U.P. in order to find the other escaped Conduits. With Reggie's help, Delsin battles D.U.P. forces and tracks down core fragments to develop his powers. He eventually encounters the other two escaped Conduits, Fetch and Eugene, and absorbs their powers. After both confrontations, Delsin defends the Conduits from Reggie, who initially views them as "freaks", and can choose to either redeem or corrupt them.&lt;ref name="inFamous SS" /&gt;

Now possessing three powers, Delsin encounters Hank, who has escaped again. Hank tells Delsin that Fetch and Eugene have been captured by the D.U.P., and are being held on an [[artificial island|artificial concrete island]] in [[Puget Sound]]. However, the situation turns out to be a trap set by Augustine. Reggie appears and rescues Delsin with a [[rocket launcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Infamous Second Son|developer=[[Sucker Punch Productions]]|publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=March 21, 2014 |platform=[[PlayStation 4]] |version= |scene= |level="Concrete Island" |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the brothers free Fetch and Eugene, Augustine encases Reggie's feet in concrete and blasts them off the platform.

Augustine flees back to the D.U.P. headquarters. Delsin tracks Hank down to the docks, where he is fleeing from D.U.P. forces. Hank begs for forgiveness, saying that he only worked with Augustine because she threatened to hurt his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Infamous Second Son|developer=[[Sucker Punch Productions]]|publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=March 21, 2014 |platform=[[PlayStation 4]] |version= |scene= |level= |quote='''Delsin''': You son of a bitch...

== Development ==

=== Origins and PlayStation 4 ===
[[File:PS4-Console-wDS4.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Sucker Punch Productions]] were very involved with the development of the [[PlayStation 4]] platform. They discussed with [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony]] how much power they would like with the new hardware and what refinements they would like to see on the [[DualShock#DualShock 4|DualShock 4]] gamepad.]]

[[Sucker Punch Productions]] began to develop ''Second Son'' while the [[PlayStation 4]] was still being designed.&lt;ref name="iss-runway"/&gt; Having finished work on ''[[Infamous: Festival of Blood]]'', they began to plan a new entry in the [[Infamous (series)|''Infamous'' series]]&lt;ref name="PS4 ISS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2013/05/13/what-the-playstation-4-means-for-infamous-second-son.aspx |title=
What The PlayStation 4 Means For Infamous Second Son |date=May 13, 2013 |last=Hanson |first=Ben |publisher=''[[Game Informer]]'' |accessdate=June 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the working title ''Infamous 3''.&lt;ref name="Under the Hood"/&gt; As early as 2010, they discussed with [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] their desire to bring ''Infamous'' to a new [[PlayStation]] platform.&lt;ref name="PS4 ISS"/&gt;

Sucker Punch were in close connection with the PS4's lead system architect [[Mark Cerny]], who visited the studio several times. They gave Cerny feedback about how much power a new PlayStation system would require to render their ideal open world, how fast it would be capable of doing so and to what degree of texture detail. "We had some experience there that was useful for that team when they were planning some aspects of the hardware design", producer Brian Fleming explained.&lt;ref name="Under the Hood"/&gt; He found that during the PS4's development, there was a great level of interactivity between the system's designers and game developers such as Sucker Punch.&lt;ref name="PS4 ISS"/&gt;

Sucker Punch made suggested improvements they would like to see for the [[DualShock 4]] gamepad. ''Second Son''{{'}}s designer Jaime Griesemer traveled to Sony's headquarters in Japan to discuss such improvements. The developers found they were able to adopt the DualShock 4's touchpad into ''Second Son''{{'}}s gameplay (for example, players emulate the in-game [[fingerprint recognition|fingerprint scanner]] using the DualShock 4 touchpad).&lt;ref name="PS4 ISS"/&gt;

The game was envisioned to take full advantage of the hardware, without the imposition of porting to older platforms like the [[PlayStation 3]]. The hardware let developers improve the [[particle system]] that lights Delsin's face up while he draws neon power from billboards&lt;ref name="iss-runway"/&gt; and add detailed reflections to the game world.&lt;ref name="Polygon Why NG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/11/11/5092222/why-next-gen-graphics-matter-for-infamous-second-son |title=Why next-gen graphics matter for Infamous: Second Son |date=November 11, 2013 |last=McWhertor |first=Michael |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |publisher=Vox Media |accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased memory bandwidth let the team render characters with higher fidelity.&lt;ref name="PS4 ISS"/&gt; They found the PS4's simplified architecture so easy to work with that they were able to reach very high graphical quality even though the hardware was new.&lt;ref name="ng vision"/&gt;

Over 110 developers worked on the game, a number that director Nate Fox considered small. He felt that working with a small team necessitated having a defined vision for the game from the outset, "to answer those first questions about what you want your game to be".&lt;ref name="ng vision"/&gt; Sometimes, ideas came about during development that would have to be thrown out for not fitting with the game's original vision. "We kill our darlings at Sucker Punch. It's not easy; it's necessary", Fox explained.&lt;ref name="ng vision"/&gt; ''Second Son'' displays a native resolution of [[1080p]] at 30 [[frame rate|frames per second]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/03/11/infamous-second-sons-director-explains-why-the-game-runs-at-30fps/ |title=inFamous Second Son's Director Explains Why The Game Runs At 30fps |last=Inglis |first=Blair |date=March 11, 2014 |work=TheSixthAxis |publisher=Oscar Mike Media |accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design ===
[[File:Infamous Second Son game world.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Second Son''{{'}}s graphical quality was possible because development was conducted on the PS4, which Sucker Punch found powerful and easy to use. Their research for the game world led to the reproduction of Seattle landmarks such as the [[Space Needle]].|alt=A screenshot of the game world's Seattle skyline, with the Space Needle depicted in the center. Lighting, draw distances and weather effects are visible.]]

Sucker Punch elected to set ''Second Son'' in their hometown of Seattle as they could draw from their personal experiences 
in the open world's design.&lt;ref name="SP in Seattle"/&gt; During early development when team members debated where ''Second Son'' would be set, Seattle rated high on a list of possibilities. Fleming considered that the city had not been featured in many games prior to ''Second Son'' and so would not be "overblown", and felt that Seattle's weather and mixture of "old and new" architecture would make it an interesting setting.&lt;ref name="Digi Seattle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2013/05/17/digitizing-seattle-infamous-second-son-39-s-new-playground.aspx |title=Digitizing Seattle: Infamous Second Son's New Playground |last=Hanson |first=Ben |publisher=''[[Game Informer]]'' |date=May 17, 2013 |accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team conducted fieldwork in Seattle's nearby forests with audio and video equipment, which was used to reproduce local flora and the chirping sounds of local [[American robin]]s. Seattle landmarks such as [[Pioneer Square, Seattle|Pioneer Square]], the [[Space Needle]] and Elephant Car Washes feature in the game. The developers licensed logos and signs from local businesses. Griesemer called the game world an "abstraction" of Seattle rather than a re-creation since its layout did not suit ''Second Son''{{'}}s gameplay and required the team to make necessary changes.&lt;ref name="Under the Hood"/&gt; The team wanted to thematically explore Seattle's heritage of [[Pacific Northwest]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes in the game.&lt;ref name="Digi Seattle"/&gt;

The designers used graphic sliders in the [[game engine]] to determine the amount of water covering the streets. Like Seattle, rain is frequent in the game.&lt;ref name="Under the Hood"/&gt; The lighting effects (such as neon light from Delsin's powers) coupled with reflections help bring color into Seattle's dark and rainy atmosphere.&lt;ref name="iss-runway"/&gt; Because of the move to the PS4, Sucker Punch were able to render more open world than what was possible in previous ''Infamous'' games. "You get a better feel of the city when you can see more of it", said Griesemer.&lt;ref name="PS4 ISS"/&gt;

After deciding on Seattle for the setting, the developers began to think about the superpowers that Delsin would possess. They added neon lighting to the city to amplify the "beautiful reflective streets", and subsequently decided to make neon a source of power for Delsin because of its prevalence.&lt;ref name="Under the Hood"/&gt; Animation director Billy Harper considered Delsin's smoke powers challenging to design, as the team wanted to make powers feel more fluid than in previous ''Infamous'' games. They removed Cole's "contorted hand poses" to improve the connection between Delsin and his powers.&lt;ref name="Designing ISS"/&gt; Fox felt that smoke helps Delsin deftly navigate the game world by letting him zip up buildings and through enemies.&lt;ref name="Designing ISS"/&gt; Griesemer (who previously worked with [[Bungie]] on the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' series]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/news/infamous-second-son-lead-designer-jaime-griesemer-confirms-sucker-punch-departure/ |title=InFamous: Second Son lead designer Jaime Griesemer confirms Sucker Punch departure |last=Holzworth |first=Chris |date=March 18, 2014 |work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |publisher=EGM Media, LLC |accessdate=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; wanted to bring the fluidity of [[first-person shooter]]s to ''Second Son''{{'}}s combat. The team reviewed the control scheme of previous ''Infamous'' games and "removed some of the complexity that was preventing people from interacting with the game".&lt;ref name="Designing ISS"/&gt;

Griesemer said that a recurring theme throughout ''Infamous'' games that they wanted to continue with ''Second Son'' was the idea of "modern [[classical element|elemental]] powers", variations on commonplace powers drawn from the game world.&lt;ref name="Under the Hood"/&gt; Producer Brian Fleming found that the graphical effects helped to inform players of the amount of power Delsin possesses. "This is a game about super powers, so for us, the way the effects look tells you a lot about how you're playing the game", he explained.&lt;ref name="Polygon Why NG"/&gt; Fox considered that the game world's resemblance to Seattle helped the superpower elements feel authentic.&lt;ref name="Under the Hood"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/9/25/4702318/under-the-hood-of-infamous-second-son-hyper-real-seattle |title=Under the hood of Infamous: Second Son's hyper-real Seattle |last=McWhertor |first=Michael |date=September 25, 2013 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |accessdate=June 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Because we have that sweet foundation of plausibility, you buy into the super-powered element", he explained.&lt;ref name="SP in Seattle"/&gt;

=== Character development ===
''Second Son''{{'}}s premise is built from the ending of ''[[Infamous 2]]'' that sees protagonist Cole MacGrath sacrifice himself to save humanity. They looked at [[PlayStation Network#Trophies|Trophy]] data and found the majority (78%)&lt;ref name="Designing ISS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2013/05/08/a-new-beginning-designing-infamous-second-son.aspx |title=A New Beginning: Designing Infamous Second Son |last=Hanson |first=Ben |publisher=''[[Game Informer]]'' |date=May 8, 2013 |accessdate=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of ''Infamous 2'' players chose this ending, and concurred with the popular choice. This allowed them to create the new protagonist, Delsin, from scratch.&lt;ref name="SP in Seattle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-06-18-super-powered-in-seattle-infamous-second-son-preview |title=Super-powered in Seattle: inFamous Second Son preview |date=June 19, 2013 |last=Matulef |first=Jeffrey |work=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network |accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Moving forward onto [''Second Son''], we said 'Alright, Cole's dead. People have voted for this. Let's make a new hero'", Fox explained.&lt;ref name="Designing ISS"/&gt; Griesemer felt that taking the ''Infamous'' series to the PS4 signified a new era, and that departing from the story of previous games would help them reach new audiences. "We needed a new entry point, and Delsin was the first step for that", he explained.&lt;ref name="Under the Hood"/&gt; The idea to move away from Cole's story came about during [[Video game development#pre-production|pre-production]] staff meetings, and was confirmed after discussions both internally and with [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]. Griesemer described the contemporaneous sentiment as "It's going to be new hardware, a new platform and we're going to have a new audience".&lt;ref name="Under the Hood"/&gt;

[[File:Infamous Second Son motion capture.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''[[Game Informer]]'' journalist Dan Ryckert participated in a demonstration of the [[motion capture]] process, where people's faces were captured and rendered in the game using high-definition digital cameras.|alt=A digital rendering of a man's face in a motion capture software.]]

Delsin's Native American heritage came from the game's setting in the Pacific Northwest, which features a large Native American population.&lt;ref name="Under the Hood"/&gt; Delsin wears a [[beanie (seamed cap)|beanie]] inspired by one that Harper would wear around the studio (Harper recounted one particular staff meeting where four of the six team members were wearing hats). Delsin's character was inspired by United Kingdom [[street artist]] [[Banksy]], as the development team appreciated Banksy's clandestine, satirical work. Developing Delsin's personality, the team posited the hypothetical: "What if [[Johnny Knoxville]] had powers? What would he do with it?".&lt;ref name="Daxter To Delsin"/&gt; Harper considered Delsin "full of reckless abandon",&lt;ref name="Daxter To Delsin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2013/05/20/from-daxter-to-delsin-the-work-of-infamous-second-son-39-s-animation-director.aspx |title=From Daxter To Delsin: The Work Of Infamous Second Son's Animation Director |last=Hanson |first=Ben |work=[[Game Informer]] |date=May 20, 2013 |accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the kind of character that would, upon gaining superpowers, jump off a cliff to see what happens.&lt;ref name="Dissecting Delsin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/infamous_second_son/b/playstation4/archive/2013/05/15/dissecting-delsin-a-profile-on-second-sons-protagonist.aspx |title=Dissecting Delsin: A Profile On Sucker Punch’s New Protagonist |last=Reeves |first=Ben |publisher=''[[Game Informer]]'' |date=May 15, 2013 |accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox considered Delsin "flawed in a way I think a lot of us can relate to", trying to live up to his successful brother Reggie.&lt;ref name="SP in Seattle"/&gt; He called the game's story a "hero's journey".&lt;ref name="Under the Hood"/&gt;

[[Digital Domain]] were brought on board for the [[motion capture]] work. Fox helped direct the actors' performances, but found that they did not need much guidance for their roles. "You need to let them understand what you need from a scene, but the actors are so much better equipped to deliver that than me", he explained.&lt;ref name="ng vision"/&gt; Fleming considered that using motion capture added authenticity to the characters. "The ability to capture [Delsin's] facial reaction when he's like 'Oh, shit', but doesn't say 'Oh shit'—that's a big deal", he explained.&lt;ref name="Polygon Why NG"/&gt;

Most of the [[non-player character]]s (NPCs) that inhabit the open world were motion captured. The developers contacted casting agencies, and asked their friends and families if they would like to appear as extras in the game. Over 75 people were scanned in a three-day period. They were seated in chairs and told not to move or smile, and a high-definition digital camera captured a 3D model of their faces. The camera sent out strobe light patterns to capture the volume and shape of each face. A 360-degree setup captured the actors' moving bodies, but mannequins were also used to help capture different clothing styles. Data collected from the cameras was used by the designers to render digital models, each composed of roughly 1.4 million polygons—any blank spots on the models would be digitally filled in by the designers.

''Infamous Second Son'' received "generally favorable" reviews, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/10/infamous-second-son-sold-over-1-million-copies-in-nine-days |title=Infamous: Second Son Sold Over 1 Million Copies in Nine Days |last=Reilly |first=Luke |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date= April 9, 2014 |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vince Ingenito of [[IGN]] recalled being left "staring slack-jawed" at the visuals, and called the [[open world]] "beautifully and diversely realized" with impressive lighting effects.&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt; Tom Mc Shea of [[GameSpot]] called the visuals "incredible".&lt;ref name="GameSpot Review"/&gt; Oli Welsh of [[Eurogamer]] praised Seattle's art direction, and found the [[draw distance]]s and frame rate consistent.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer Review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-03-19-infamous-second-son-review | title = inFamous: Second Son review | first = Oli | last = Welsh | date = March 20, 2014 | accessdate = March 20, 2014 | work = [[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Meikleham of ''[[PlayStation Official Magazine - UK|PlayStation Official Magazine]]'' (OPM) was very impressed with the graphics and 1080p definition, but cited occasional frame rate dips during intense combat. He enjoyed playing in Seattle and using his powers to level the destructible environments.&lt;ref name="opmuk review1"/&gt; Tamoor Hussain of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' (CVG) praised graphical details like the particle and lighting systems. "[The game is] colorful, rich in detail and has some of the best effects we've seen on console", he wrote.&lt;ref name="cvgreview1"/&gt;

GameSpot's Mc Shea considered the combat well-balanced between [[Infamous (video game)|''Infamous'']]'s slower pace and ''[[Infamous 2]]''{{'}}s frenetic action, and enjoyed Delsin's agility and power.&lt;ref name="GameSpot Review"/&gt; Chris Carter of [[Destructoid]] considered the combat's simplicity its strength, finding Delsin easy to control and navigate the world.&lt;ref name="Destructoid"/&gt; ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' were underwhelmed with the game's opening because of its "skittish" parkour,&lt;ref name="Edge Review"/&gt; but noted that once Delsin gained powers and reached Seattle, the game became very fun. They felt that enemies were clever enough to make combat a fun challenge, and called the main missions "for the most part well designed and generously proportioned".&lt;ref name="Edge Review"/&gt; IGN's Ingenito enjoyed using Delsin's powers in combat, and called each set "strong enough to hang an entire game on".&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt; He found upgrading Delsin's powers helped keep the combat fresh and made for good [[replay value]].&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt; Philip Kollar of [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] favored using neon power, but praised the balance and variety between all of them. He called the combat "a hell of a lot of fun".&lt;ref name="Polygon Review"/&gt; Eurogamer's Welsh found the combat imperfect yet fun, but did not think that upgrading Delsin's skills made enough of a difference to his power.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer Review"/&gt;

Destructoid's Carter thought that Delsin was a more interesting protagonist than "wooden" Cole, which helped his investment into the story.&lt;ref name="Destructoid"/&gt; IGN's Ingenito thought Delsin was an interesting lead character, especially because of the chemistry with Reggie. He found [[Troy Baker]]'s performance of Delsin "[imbued] with a charm and youthful abandon that keeps it from feeling tropey {{sic}} or overwrought". However, he found supporting characters like Fetch underdeveloped and the narrative too straightforward.&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt; Although calling the characters clichéd, ''Edge'' felt that they were written and acted well.&lt;ref name="Edge Review"/&gt; GameSpot's Mc Shea called Delsin annoying and immature, and found the gameplay more interesting than the "tired" story.&lt;ref name="GameSpot Review"/&gt; Eurogamer's Welsh considered the plot driven by "inconsequential [[MacGuffin]]s" and thought the ending rushed, but praised the story for not stretching on too long.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer Review"/&gt; Polygon's Kollar felt that the story did not explore its themes of [[surveillance]] and security-over-freedom well enough, such that its impact was diminished. He was overall disappointed with the narrative, despite finding the main characters written better than in previous ''Infamous'' games.&lt;ref name="Polygon Review"/&gt; OPM's Meikleham was put off by Delsin's arrogance and was underwhelmed with the story, but he was impressed by the quality of the motion capture performances.&lt;ref name="opmuk review1"/&gt;

''Edge'' and Eurogamer's Welsh faulted the morality system because they did not think it had enough influence on the story.&lt;ref name="Edge Review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer Review"/&gt; IGN's Ingenito called it "woefully outdated", and felt that making evil choices severely jarred with Delsin's character.&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt; He found the system redundant because Delsin became more powerful when he strictly adhered to either a good or evil play-style, rather than crossing in-between.&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt; GameSpot's Mc Shea felt that the morality system was too binary because there was no "moral gray area" between playing good and evil.&lt;ref name="GameSpot Review"/&gt; Polygon's Kollar reflected Mc Shea's opinion that the morality choices were too binary, and had difficulty connecting to his choices because they were too polarized between good and evil.&lt;ref name="Polygon Review"/&gt; OPM's Meikleham felt that the morality system had "little to no impact on gameplay".&lt;ref name="opmuk review1"/&gt; Danny Cowan of [[Joystiq]] thought that the morality system was well-balanced, with equal incentive and drawback tied to Delsin's choices.&lt;ref name="joystiq review"/&gt;

GameSpot's Mc Shea found ''Second Son''{{'}}s open world beholden to a dated formula. He described Seattle as "a playground for you to go nuts in" instead of "a living, breathing world", with the Seattleites existing only as fodder for players.&lt;ref name="GameSpot Review"/&gt; ''CVG''{{'}}s Hussain called Seattle "hauntingly empty", with the sparsely distributed NPCs behaving inanimately.&lt;ref name="cvgreview1"/&gt; He felt that the open world's lifelessness was the game's biggest detractor, and he drew unfavorable comparison with ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', ''[[Sleeping Dogs (video game)|Sleeping Dogs]]'' and ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]'', which he felt featured better open worlds.&lt;ref name="cvgreview1"/&gt; Eurogamer's Welsh felt that ''Second Son'' did not innovate the open world genre as well as it could have because it relied too heavily on many of the genre's tropes.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer Review"/&gt; Polygon's Kollar felt that there was not enough variation in the missions and activities, as "virtually all culminate in the goal of beating up more soldiers or thugs".&lt;ref name="Polygon Review"/&gt; ''Edge'' found the amount of content in the game thin, finding little merit in additional playthroughs because of the repetitive side-missions. "Approach [''Second Son''] as an action game that just happens to be set in a nonlinear environment and it makes more sense", they wrote.&lt;ref name="Edge Review"/&gt; Destructoid's Carter found the amount of content ample, and enjoyed liberating the city and collecting Blast Shards.&lt;ref name="Destructoid"/&gt;

The '''International Energy Agency''' ('''IEA'''; {{lang-fr|Agence internationale de l'énergie}}) is a [[Paris]]-based autonomous intergovernmental organization established in the framework of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) in 1974 in the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. The IEA was initially dedicated to responding to physical disruptions in the supply of [[Petroleum|oil]], as well as serving as an information source on statistics about the international [[Petroleum industry|oil market]] and other [[energy sector]]s.

The IEA acts as a policy adviser to its member states, but also works with non-member countries, especially [[China]], [[India]], and [[Russia]]. The Agency's mandate has broadened to focus on the "3Es" of effectual energy policy: [[energy security]], [[economic development]], and [[environmental protection]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IEA has a broad role in promoting [[Energy development|alternate energy]] sources (including renewable energy), rational energy policies, and multinational energy technology co-operation.

IEA member countries are required to maintain total oil stock levels equivalent to at least 90 days of the previous year's net imports. At the end of July 2009, IEA member countries held a combined stockpile of almost 4.3 billion [[Barrel (unit)#Oil barrel|barrels]] (680,000,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of oil.

On 1 September 2015, [[Fatih Birol]] took office as the new Executive Director, succeeding in this position former Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs, [[Maria van der Hoeven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/newsroomandevents/news/2015/september/fatih-birol-ushers-in-new-era-for-iea.html |title=Fatih Birol ushers in new era for IEA—Takes office as Executive Director of global energy authority |work=IEA |date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The IEA was established to meet the industrial countries' energy organization needs in the wake of the 1973–1974 oil crisis. Although the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) had structures such as the Council, the Executive Committee, the Oil Committee, and the Energy Committee that could potentially deal with energy questions, it could not respond effectively to the crisis. The OECD had adopted the Oil Apportionment Decision &lt;nowiki&gt;[C(72)201(Final)]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, laying out procedures to be carried out in the event of an oil supply emergency in Europe, but these procedures were not implemented during the crisis. In addition, the OECD had adopted recommendations on oil stockpiling in Europe, but due to their limited scope, these measures could have only a limited role in an oil supply emergency.&lt;ref&gt;Scott (1994), pages 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Establishment of the new organization was proposed by [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] in his address to the [[Pilgrims Society]] in [[London]] on 12 December 1973. Also in December 1973, at the summit of the [[European Communities]] in [[Copenhagen]], Danish Prime Minister [[Anker Jørgensen]], who chaired the summit, declared that the summit found it "useful to study with other oil-consuming countries within the framework of the OECD ways of dealing with the common short and long term energy problems of consumer countries."

At the Washington Energy Conference on 11–13 February 1974, the ministers of thirteen principal oil consumer countries stated "the need for a comprehensive action program to deal with all facets of the world energy situation by cooperative measures. In so doing they will build on the work of the OECD."&lt;ref&gt;Scott (1994), pp.43–45&lt;/ref&gt;

While creating a new energy organization, it was decided to utilize the framework of the OECD, as it had experience in dealing with oil and other energy questions, had expertise in economic analysis and statistics, had established staff, physical facilities, legal status and privileges and immunities, and was the principal organization of the industrial countries. However, the OECD has a rule of unanimity, and not all member states were ready to participate. Therefore, instead of an integrated approach, an autonomous approach was chosen.&lt;ref&gt;Scott (1994), pp.41–42&lt;/ref&gt;

The IEA was created on 18 November 1974 by the Agreement on an International Energy Program (IEP Agreement).&lt;ref&gt;Scott (1994), page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

During its history, the IEA has intervened in oil markets three times by releasing oil stocks – in 1991 during the [[Gulf War]], in 2005 by releasing {{convert|2|Moilbbl/d}} for a month after [[Hurricane Katrina]] affected US production, and most recently in 2011 to offset continued disruption to oil supplies as a result of the [[2011 Libyan civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;

In April 2001, the IEA, in collaboration with five other international organisations ([[APEC]], [[Eurostat]], OLADE, [[OPEC]], [[UNSD]]) launched the Joint Oil Data Exercise, which in 2005 became the [[Joint Organisations Data Initiative]] (JODI).

According to the ''World Energy Outlook 2010'', conventional crude oil production [[Peak oil|peaked]] in 2006, with al all-time maximum of 70 millions of [[oil barrels|barrels]] per day.&lt;ref name=IEA2010&gt;[[International Energy Agency]], [https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/weo2010.pdf ''World Energy Outlook 2010''], pages 48 and 125 ({{ISBN|9789264086241}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014 in its ''[[World Energy Outlook]]'' report, the IEA warned US$48 trillion in investment and credible long term policy planning would be required between 2014 and 2035 to secure sufficient [[energy supplies]] for that period. "The reliability and sustainability of our future energy system depends on investment. But this won't materialize unless there are credible policy frameworks in place as well as stable access to long-term sources of finance. Neither of these conditions should be taken for granted," van der Hoeven said in a statement accompanying the report.&lt;ref name="IEAreport"&gt;

== Member states ==

Only the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] member states can become members of the IEA. Except for [[Chile]], [[Iceland]], [[Israel]], and [[Slovenia]], all OECD member states are members of the IEA. In 2014, Estonia joined the IEA and became its 29th member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/countries/membercountries International Energy Agency membership list]&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Morocco, Singapore and Thailand are the associate members of IEA.

=== Associate member ===

In March 2017, after a series of intensive consultations with all the relevant ministries, India joined the IEA as an association country.&lt;ref&gt;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/india-becomes-associate-member-of-international-energy-agency/articleshow/57925914.cms&lt;/ref&gt; This was a major milestone for global energy governance and another major step towards the IEA becoming a truly global energy organisation and strengthening ties with the key energy players. Since then, Indian delegations have actively participated in IEA committees, meetings and workshops. The IEA launches major publications in New Delhi to share our findings with Indian energy communities and policy-makers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iea.org/countries/non-membercountries/india/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critics ==
[[File:Reality versus IEA predictions - annual photovoltaic additions 2002-2016.png|thumb|Real development of global [[photovoltaics]] additions vs. predictions by the IEA, 2002-2016]]
The IEA has been criticised for systematically underestimating the role of [[renewable energy]] sources in future energy systems such as [[photovoltaics]] and their cost reductions.&lt;ref&gt;Felix Creutzig et al.: The underestimated potential of solar energy to mitigate climate change. In: Nature Energy 2, 2017, [[doi:10.1038/nenergy.2017.140]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Auke Hoekstra et al.: Creating Agent-Based Energy Transition Management Models That Can Uncover Profitable Pathways to Climate Change Mitigation.

Ahead of the launch of the ''2009 [[World Energy Outlook]]'', the British daily newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'', referring to an unidentified senior IEA official, alleged that the agency was deliberately downplaying the risk of [[peak oil]] under pressures from the USA. According to a second unidentified former senior IEA official it was "imperative not to anger the Americans" and that the world has already entered the "peak oil zone".&lt;ref name=guardian1&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Guardian'' also referred to a team of scientists from [[Uppsala University]] in Sweden who studied the 2008 World Energy Outlook and concluded the forecasts of the IEA were unattainable. According to their peer-reviewed report, oil production in 2030 would not exceed {{convert|75|Moilbbl/d}} while the IEA forecasts a production of {{convert|105|Moilbbl/d}}. The lead author of the report, Dr. Kjell Aleklett, has claimed that IEA's reports are "political documents".&lt;ref name=guardian2&gt;

The anticorruption [[NGO]] [[Global Witness]] wrote in its report ''Heads in the Sand'' that "Global Witness' analysis demonstrates that the Agency continues to retain an overly-optimistic, and therefore misleading, view about potential future oil production." According to Global Witness, "the Agency's over-confidence, despite credible data, external analysis and underlying fundamentals all strongly suggesting a more precautionary approach, has had a disastrous global impact."&lt;ref name=heads&gt;

In the past, the IEA has been criticized by [[environmental group]]s for underplaying the role of [[renewable energy]] technologies in favor of [[Nuclear power|nuclear]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nuclearinst.com/International&lt;/ref&gt; and [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref name=henning/&gt; In 2009, [[Guy Pearse]] stated that the IEA has consistently underestimated the potential for renewable energy alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Pearse (2009). "Quarry Vision", ''[[Quarterly Essay]]'', Issue 33, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Energy Watch Group]] (EWG), a coalition of scientists and politicians which analyses official [[energy industry]] predictions, claims that the IEA has had an institutional bias towards traditional energy sources and has been using "misleading data" to undermine the case for renewable energy, such as [[wind]] and solar. A 2008 EWG report compares IEA projections about the growth of [[wind power]] capacity and finds that it has consistently underestimated the amount of energy the [[wind power industry]] can deliver.&lt;ref name=ie&gt;[http://www.businessgreen.com/business-green/news/2233776/iea-accused-deliberately IEA accused of "deliberately" undermining global renewables industry]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in 1998, the IEA predicted global wind electricity generation would total 47.4 GW by 2020, but EWG's report states that this level was reached by the end of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energywatchgroup.org/fileadmin/global/pdf/2009-01_Wind_Power_Report.pdf Wind Power in Context – A clean Revolution in the Energy Sector p. 10.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124172640/http://www.energywatchgroup.org/fileadmin/global/pdf/2009-01_Wind_Power_Report.pdf |date=2009-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also said that the IEA has not learned the lesson of previous underestimates, and last year net additions of wind power globally were four times greater than the average IEA estimate from its 1995-2004 predictions.&lt;ref name=ie/&gt; This patterns seems to have continued through 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/05/2002-iea-predicted-solar-was-going-nowhere-and-2003-and-2004-and-2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Amid discontent from across the renewables sector at the IEA's performance as a global energy watchdog, the [[International Renewable Energy Agency]] was formed on January 26, 2009. The aim is to have the agency fully operational by 2010 with an initial annual budget of €25m.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessgreen.com/business-green/news/2234994/international-renewables-agnecy International Renewable Energy Agency launches today]&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental groups have become critical&lt;ref&gt;http://priceofoil.org/2016/04/06/beyond-450-why-the-iea-climate-scenario-falls-short/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://priceofoil.org/content/uploads/2016/11/IEA-open-letter-modelling-for-climate-success-August-12-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of the IEA's 450 Scenario (created to align with the 2009 Copenhagen Accord), contending that it does not align with up-to-date climate science, nor is it consistent with the Paris climate agreement that aspires to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In March 2017, the IEA (along with IRENA) published a report&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/Perspectives_for_the_Energy_Transition_2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that considers a safer climate scenario than their current 450S. This scenario offers improved chances of limiting global warming to less than two degrees, but –  according to research organization Oil Change International –  still falls short of adequately addressing climate science and the decarbonization required to reach agreed upon global climate limits.&lt;ref&gt;http://priceofoil.org/2017/03/23/why-the-international-energy-agency-still-gets-it-wrong-on-fossil-fuels/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the IEA was criticized in [[World Economic Forum|Davos]] by Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister [[Al-Falih]], for overhyping the US shale oil industry amid forecasts of oversupply for the  oil market in their January Oil Market Report. Al-Falih was exasperated with those claims, arguing that natural depletion, and strong demand growth meant that there was plenty of room for new supplies, while the shale drillers wouldn’t crash the market. He further said that the IEA is overstating the role of shale in a global market, and how the core job of the IEA, is not to take things out of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cunningham|first1=Nick|title=Saudi Oil Minister Tired Of Shale Hype|url=https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Saudi-Oil-Minister-Tired-Of-Shale-Hype.html|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IEA, arguably the most influential think tank widely used as source for policy makers around the world, is criticized for consistently underestimating the growth of solar PV in its yearly World Energy Outlook market forecasts. The solar power installed in 2016 is 4,813% more than what was predicted by IEA in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://electrek.co/2017/11/14/solar-power-underestimated-4813-percent/|title=Solar power underestimated by 4,813% in the USA – don’t lose hope though!|date=2017-11-14|work=Electrek|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 itself, the solar PV addition was 16 times more than what was predicted by IEA a year earlier. However, the IEA's current forecasts for solar power does not seem to catch up with the exponential growth in the sector. The misleading projections has perpetuated the false impression that the growth of solar power requires huge subsidies, and has the potential to discourage investment in solar energy market and consequently, hold back even faster growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theenergycollective.com/onclimatechangepolicy/2413557/underestimating-contribution-solar-pv-risks-damaging-policy-making|title=Underestimating the Contribution of Solar PV Risks Damaging Policy Making - The Energy Collective|date=2017-09-27|work=The Energy Collective|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://energypost.eu/iea-exaggerates-costs-underestimates-growth-solar-power/|title=How the IEA exaggerates the costs and underestimates the growth of solar power - EnergyPost.eu|date=2014-03-04|work=EnergyPost.eu|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bioenergy ==
[http://www.ieabioenergy.com/ IEA Bioenergy] was set up in 1978 by the International Energy Agency (IEA) with the aim of improving cooperation and information exchange between countries that have national programmes in [[bioenergy]] research, development and deployment.

The International Energy Agency acts as energy policy advisor to 29 Member Countries plus the European Commission, in their effort to ensure reliable, affordable, and [[clean energy]] for their citizens. The IEA’s initial role was to co-ordinate measures in times of oil supply emergencies. As energy markets have changed, so has the IEA. Current work focuses on [[climate change policies]], market reform, energy technology collaboration and outreach to the rest of the world, especially major producers and consumers of energy like China, India, Russia and the OPEC countries.

Activities are set up under Implementing Agreements. These are independent bodies operating in a framework provided by the IEA. There are 42 currently active Implementing Agreements, one of which is IEA Bioenergy.

Twenty two countries plus the European Commission participate in IEA Bioenergy: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, European Commission, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and USA.

=== IEA Bioenergy Tasks ===
The work of IEA Bioenergy is structured in a number of Tasks, which have well defined objectives, budgets, and time frames. The collaboration which earlier was focused on Research, Development and Demonstration is now increasingly also emphasising Deployment on a large-scale and worldwide. Each participating country pays a modest financial contribution toward administrative requirements, shares the costs of managing the Tasks and provides in-kind contributions to fund participation of national personnel in the Tasks. The scope of the work undertaken within IEA Bioenergy is shown in the graphic.

Each Task is led by one of the participating countries (Operating Agent) with technical effort co-ordinated by a Task Leader. The work is directed by the Executive Committee. For the period 2016-2018, there are 10 Tasks. All of the Tasks have a common duration of three years.

Current Tasks:

;[http://task32.ieabioenergy.com/ Task 32]: [[Biomass]] combustion and [[co-firing]]
;[http://task33.ieabioenergy.com/ Task 33]: [[Gasification of biomass]] and waste

== Promotion of renewable energy – Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme ==

The '''IEA Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme''' ('''PVPS''') is one of the collaborative R&amp;D Agreements established within the IEA and, since its establishment in 1993, the PVPS participants have been conducting a variety of joint projects in the application of [[photovoltaic]] conversion of [[solar energy]] into electricity.

In 2011, IEA chief economist [[Fatih Birol]] said the current US$409 billion equivalent of fossil fuel subsidies are encouraging a wasteful use of energy, and that the cuts in subsidies is the biggest policy item that would help renewable energies get more market share and reduce [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Renewable-Energy-Being-Held-Back-by-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidies-IEA.html |title=Renewable Energy Being Held Back by Fossil Fuel Subsidies – IEA |date=1 November 2011 |work=Oilprice.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, an IEA report entitled ''[[Deploying Renewables 2011]]'' said "renewable energy technology is becoming increasingly cost competitive and growth rates are in line to meet levels required of a sustainable energy future". The report also said "subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified in order to give an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits". The renewable electricity sector has "grown rapidly in the past five years and now provides nearly 20 percent of the world's power generation", the IEA said.&lt;ref name=henning/&gt; The IEA's report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand. "A portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances, in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support," the IEA said, and added that "[[cost reduction]]s in critical technologies, such as wind and solar, are set to continue."&lt;ref name=henning&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/23/us-energy-iea-renewables-idUSTRE7AM0OV20111123 |title=Renewable energy becoming cost competitive, IEA says |author=Henning Gloystein |date=2011-11-23 |work=[[Reuters]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the International Energy Agency said that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance [[sustainability]], reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating [[climate change]], and keep [[fossil fuel]] prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared".&lt;ref name=ie11&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf |title=Solar Energy Perspectives: Executive Summary |year=2011 |format=PDF |publisher=International Energy Agency |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63fIHKr1S?url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf |archivedate=2011-12-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For the first time in 2012, an annual medium-term report which analyses the renewable energy sector will be published by the IEA. This publication on renewable energy – "which is now the fastest growing sector of the energy mix and accounts for almost a fifth of all electricity produced worldwide – will join annual medium-term reports on oil, gas and coal, which the IEA already produces". With this report, "renewable energy takes its rightful seat at the table alongside the other major energy sources".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ogfj.com/articles/2012/02/iea-recognizes-ascent-of-renewable-energy-market-with-new-report.html |title=IEA recognizes ascent of renewable energy market with new report |author=The International Energy Agency |date=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carbon capture ==

IEA promotes reduction of [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[Carbon dioxide emission|emissions]] for both conventional fossil-fuel [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) and for bioenergy with CCS ([[BECCS]]) by working with member and partner nations on development of cost effective and efficient international and national energy policies including CCS, trading mechanisms and low-carbon technologies. The 2012 IEA report entitled "A Policy Strategy for Carbon Capture and Storage" argues for comprehensive policy mechanisms that include setting a market price on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions as key to reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. "In contrast to renewable energy or applications of [[energy conservation|energy efficiency]], CCS generates no revenue, nor other market benefits, so long as there is no price on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. It is both costly to install and, once in place, has increased operating costs. Effective, well-designed policy support is essential in overcoming these barriers and the subsequent deployment of CCS technology."&lt;ref&gt;

{{main|International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation}}

At the Heiligendamm Summit in June 2007, the [[G8]] acknowledged an [[European Union|EU]] proposal for an international initiative on [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] tabled in March 2007, and agreed to explore, together with the International Energy Agency, the most effective means to promote energy efficiency internationally. A year later, on 8 June 2008, the G8 countries, China, India, South Korea and the European Community decided to establish the International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation, at the Energy Ministerial meeting hosted by Japan in the frame of the 2008 G8 Presidency, in Aomori.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/08/380&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=e Rapid - Press Releases - EUROPA&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

:

The '''International Socialist Commission''', also known as the '''International Socialist Committee''' or the '''Berne International''' was a coordinating committee of socialists parties that adhered to the idea of the [[Zimmerwald Conference]] of 1915.

== Early history ==

The Zimmerwald Conference elected [[Angelica Balabanoff]], [[Odino Morgari]] and [[Charles Naine]] to the Commission, with the Swiss socialist [[Robert Grimm]] as chairman and Balabanoff as interpreter.&lt;ref&gt;Olga Hess Gankin and H.H. Fisher eds, ''The Bolsheviks and the First World War: the origins of the Third International'' Stanford University Press, 1940 pp.325-6&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee was charged with setting up a temporary secretariat and publishing a bulletin. The ISCs initial purpose was to act as an intermediary between the affiliated groups in their struggle for peace. It was not to act as a replacement for the [[International Socialist Bureau]] and dissolve as soon as the ISB could begin functioning normally. Other adherents of the Zimmerwald movement, such as [[Vladimir Lenin]], saw it as the beginning of a new International.&lt;ref&gt;Fainsod, Merle ''International socialism and the World War'' New York, Octagon Books 1973 p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commissions activity in the first months of its existences consisted of translating the manifesto and resolutions of the conference and distributing them as widely as possible. To that end they first forwarded copies of the first number of their ''Bulletin'' to the socialist and trade union papers of the neutral countries. Within the belligerent countries the ISC was able to have the full documents published in 
Italy, Russia, France, England and Bulgaria but only summaries in Austria and Germany. They also sent a circular to all the parties adhering to the ISB announcing their existence and the objects of the group. Only the [[Danish Social Democrats|Danish party]] replied, officially disapproving of the Zimmerwald venture. However, at the Congress of the [[Swiss Socialist Party|Swiss Socialist Democratic Party]] at [[Aarau]] November 20–21, the delegates declared their adherence to the ISC and granted the organization 300 [[Swiss franc|francs]].&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher p.363&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 27, 1915, ISC sent out a confidential circular (which was nevertheless leaked to the unfriendly press) suggesting that the adhering groups appoint up to three extra delegates to join the Commissioners as part of an Enlarged Committee. The first session of this Enlarged Committee of the International Socialist Commission was held in Berne February 5–8, 1916. No official list of attendees was published and sources disagree about who was present. Fainsod lists the following: Robert Grimm and [[Fritz Platten]] from the Swiss Social Democratic Party; Lenin and [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]] from the [[Bolsheviks]]; [[Julius Martov]] and [[Pavel Axelrod]] from the [[Mensheviks]]; [[David Riazanov]] of the [[Mezhraiontsy]] (also known as the Inter-District Committee); [[Feliks Kon]] and [[Pawel Lewinson]] from the [[Polish Socialist Party - Left]]; [[Bertha Thalheimer]], [[Adolf Hoffman]] and [[Georg Ledebour]], dissidents from the [[German Social Democratic Party]]; [[Giacinto Menotti Serrati|Serrati]], [[Giuseppe Modigliani|Modigliani]] and Angelica Balabanoff from the [[Italian Socialist Party]]; [[Christian Rakovsky]] from the [[Social Democratic Party of Romania (1910-1918)|Social Democratic Party of Romania]] and [[Edmondo Peluso]] from the [[Socialist Party of Portugal|Social Democratic Party of Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;Fainsod, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Hoover Institution]] adds [[Alexander Martynov]], for the Mensheviks, [[Franz Koritschoner]], a dissident member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]]; [[Henri Guilbeaux]], editor of the ''Demain''; [[Karl Radek]] of the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]]; and [[Willi Münzenberg]], secretary of the [[International Socialist Youth League]]. Furthermore, there was apparently a representative of the Dutch Zimmerwaldists present, or one of the above may have held the Dutch mandate. The identity of this person remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher pp.377-378. All party identifications are from Gankin and Fisher. Furthermore, Zinoviev's account of the conference, translated in Gankin and Fisher, mentions an Italian delegate, [[Rigola]], representing the [[Italian General Confederation of Labour|CGT]], p.384. He also says that the French and English delegates could not attend but sent letters, despite the supposed presence of Guilbeaux.&lt;/ref&gt;

After some debate the meeting decided to issue a circular (though not a full manifesto as the [[Zimmerwald Left]]s had advocated) on the basis of a draft written by Grimm and extensively rewritten by a commission consisting of Zinoviev, Rakovsky, Serrati, Martov, Grimm and two delegates representing Germany and the ISC whose identity is not apparent.&lt;ref&gt;Fainsod, p.86 gives the name of the first four and says there were also two ISC representatives and an unnamed German. Zinoviev's account of the meeting in Gankin and Fisher p.380 mentions Grimm being on the Commission&lt;/ref&gt; The Lefts were still not entirely satisfied with the circular, but considered it an improvement over the Zimmerwald Manifesto. The meeting also decided to arrange a new conference, drew up conditions for participation in it and a provisional agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher pp.381-383&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kienthal to the Russian Revolution ==

The ISC set to work arranging for a new congress of Zimmerald adherents which met at [[Kienthal]], Switzerland on April 24, 1916. Forty three delegates met at this conference, representing Germany, France, Italy, Russia, Poland, Switzerland, Serbia, Portugal and Great Britain. The ISC publicly announced that the Conference was going to be held in the Netherlands to avoid passport denial or secret police surveillance, but a number of delegates were prevented from attending anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Fainsod, p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kienthal Conference]] adopted another manifesto and some important resolutions, but it declined to advocate a policy to be followed by its adherents toward the [[Neutral Socialist Conferences during the First World War#Hague, 1916|conference of Neutral Socialists]] scheduled to meet at the Hague that summer. This was deferred to the second meeting of the ISC Enlarged Committee on May 2. Each organization that participated in the Kienthal Conference was represented by one delegate. This meeting "considered some administrative matters, authenticated the Kienthal resolutions, and discussed matters of parliamentary action" as well as the Hague Conference. One group, headed by Martov, advocated participation, arguing that no opportunity should be missed to expose to the workers the "cause of the failure" of the International Socialist Bureau. Zinoviev argued against, claiming it would only confuse the workers. The meeting ultimately became deadlocked, with five votes for each proposition, so it was decided that each party should make up its own mind whether to attend, but they should uphold the Zimmerwald resolutions if they did.&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher p.465&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISC Enlarged Committee attempted to meet again at [[Olten]] on February 1, 1917 to consider a proposed [[Inter-Allied Socialist Conferences of World War I#Paris, March 1917 (canceled)|Paris conference of Entente socialist parties]]. The ISC called a meeting of the Enlarged Committee members of the Allied countries, but only those groups with a presence in Switzerland were able to attend. The meeting therefore, only issued a none binding declaration recommending its affiliates not to attend. An official list of delegates was, again, not published, but the official communique stated "only those delegates of the three Russian socialist parties, who were in Switzerland - the representatives of the National Committee of the Polish Socialist Party (the Levitsa) 
and of the Bund, as well as a representative of ''La Vie Ouvriere'' in Paris, who resides in Switzerland - came to the conference." The editors of the Hoover Institutions ''The Bolsheviks and the World War'', however, state specifically that the organizations represented included the Bolsheviks, the Mensheviks, and the Russian Social Revolutionaries, as well as Henri Guilbeaux and Willi Münzenberg.&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher pp.467-8, 472. A hostile publication wrote an "ironic" report stating that Zinoviev and Radek were present as representatives of the Swiss Social Democratic Party and argued with Robert Grimm&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Russian Revolution and Stockholm ==

After the [[March Revolution of 1917|March Revolution in Russia]] the ISC decided to transfer its headquarters to [[Stockholm]], to be closer to the center of revolutionary activity. Grimm left Switzerland on April 20, and arrived at Stockholm on April 24. Three days before he left, however, Grimm had agreed to an appeal of assistance from the [[Central Committee for the Return of Political Exiles to Russia]] to intervene on their behalf with the [[Russian Provisional Government]] and the [[Petrograd Soviet]] for their return to Russia in exchange for [[German POW camps|German civil prisoners]] in Russia. However, Grimm was denied entry into Russia for the moment on the suspicion that he was a German spy.&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher p.614&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, Grimm and the ISC learned that several affiliated parties had declared themselves sympathetic to the movement for a general socialist congress at Stockholm and issued an appeal on May 10  to all the European Zimmerwaldist parties to meet in a third Zimmerwaldist conference in Stockholm for May 31 to decide the Zimmerwald movements attitude toward the proposed Stockholm Conference.&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher pp.608-609&lt;/ref&gt;

A train full of Russia exiles arrived from Switzerland in mid-May, carrying fellow ISC member and interpreter Angelica Balabanoff, as well as Martov, Riazanov, Pavel Axelrod and a number of other Russian socialist luminaries. Grimm boarded this train and set off for the Russian frontier. Before he got to the Russian border he learned that the foreign minister who denied him a visa, [[Pavel Milyukov]] had [[Miliukov note|resigned]], and three more socialists had entered the Provisional Government. The new government issued him a visa but it did not get to him until ''after'' he had crossed the Russian border under the protection of the [[Helsingfors|Helsingfors Soviet]]. Grimm and Balabanoff arrived in [[Petrograd]] in time to speak at the All-Russian Conference of the Menshevik party and convince that organization to approve attending the Third Zimmerwald Conference (they also voted to advocate participation at the proposed Stockholm Congress).&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher pp.614-615&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 28–29 they had an informal conference with members of Zimmerwaldist parties in the city. According to Balabanoff's notes this was attended by Lenin, Zinoviev and Kamenev of the Bolsheviks; [[Mark Natanson|Bobrov]] of the Social Revolutionaries; [[Grigorii Bienstock]], Martov, Martynov, and [[Yuri Larin|Larin]] of the Mensheviks; [[Raphael Abramovitch]] of the Bund; [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Mikhail Urinovich]] and Riazanov of the Inter-District Committee; Lapinski of the Polish Socialist Party - Left and Christian Rakovsky of the Romanian Social Democrats. According to her notes Trotsky, Kamenev, Zinoviev, Riazanov and herself were opposed to participation in the purposed Stockholm conference, while Rakovsky, Grimm, Bobrov and Martynov were for attending. In any case, decision would have to wait until the next Zimmerwaldist Conference. The Bolshevik delegation also tried to prevail on the ISC to issue a condemnation of socialists serving as ministers in the Provisional Government. While most at the meeting who gave an opinion were against socialist participation in the Provisional Government, there was also a broad consensus that the ISC did not have the authority to make such a statement without first consulting its affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher p.616&lt;/ref&gt;

== The "Grimm Affair" ==

While in Petrograd both Balabanoff and Grimm were vigorously criticized in the press as being German agents working for a [[separate peace]] between Germany and Allied countries. Balabanoff was accused of negotiating with the Germans on behalf the Italian Socialist Party, but the Party quickly cleared her.&lt;ref&gt;Fainsod p.154&lt;/ref&gt; However, Robert Grimm faced a more substantial charge. On May 26/27 he sent a [[telegram]] to [[Swiss Federal Council]]or [[Arthur Hoffmann (politician)|Arthur Hoffmann]] stating that there was a general desire for peace in Russia and that the only thing that could hinder it was a [[Offensive (military)|German offensive]]. Hoffmann responded on June 3, stating that people he spoke to in the German government would not launch an offensive while there was still a possibility of peace, as well as comment on possible [[Territorial dispute|territorial exchanges involving Poland, Lithuania and Galicia]]. The Provisional Government published these exchanges on June 16 and ordered Grimm deported. The event caused a [[scandal]] and opponents of the Zimmerwaldist movement from many sides used it as evidence that Zimmerwald movement was part of a German conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher pp.617-618, 621-622&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 20 Grimm resigned as Chairman of the International Socialist Commission. On the same day Carl Hoglund, acting on behalf of the Swedish Left Social Democratic Party and Youth League, appointed a commission of three to look after the affairs of the ISC -- [[Zeth Höglund]], [[Ture Nerman]] and [[Carl Carlson]]. The first act of this new leadership was to recall Balabanoff from Russia. She would thenceforth be the secretary of the ISC.&lt;ref&gt;Fainsod p.155&lt;/ref&gt; The ISC then appointed a commission of inquiry to look into the "Grimm affair". The membership of this commission consisted of [[Carl Lindhagen]] and [[Zeth Höglund]] of Sweden; [[Kirkov]] of Bulgaria; Karl Radek of Poland; Christian Rakovsky of Romania; Orlovsky of Russia; and [[Karl Moor (Swiss banker)|Karl Moor]] of Switzerland&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher p.619-20. Fainsod, p.154 gives a slightly different list, including [[Olausen]] of Norway and [[Otto Lang]] of Switzerland, but excluding Rakovsky and Moor. Also gives Bulgarian delegates name as "Krykov". On the final page of the translation of the report, the Commission is signed "Hoglund, Sweden; Kirkov, Bulgaria; Lang, Switzerland; Lindhagen, Sweden; Olaussen, Norway; Orlovsky, Russia; Radek, Poland"&gt;Gankin and Fisher p.629&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission found that Grimm had made the telegraphic exchange without the knowledge of Balabanoff or any of the other Zimmerwaldists in Petrograd, and, while condemning him for practicing a kind of [[secret diplomacy]], absolved him of attempting to reach a separate peace with Germany. It also absolved the International Socialist Commission itself, as no other member besides Grimm knew about the telegraphs.&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher pp.627-629&lt;/ref&gt;

The "affair" also had repercussions in Switzerland. Councilor Hoffman resigned on June 19. When Grimm returned he faced another commission of inquiry, this time appointed by the presidium of the Swiss Social Democratic Party. On September 1, 1917 the presidium voted 18-15 to accept the majority report of the commission, which came to most of the same conclusions as the Stockholm commission and recommended Grimm be restored to his previous party posts. A minority report signed by Charles Naine, Grimms former ISC colleague, was more condemnatory and denied the right of the presidium to restore Grimm to his previous mandates.&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher pp.619-620&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Third Zimmerwald Conference ==

Meanwhile, the ISC in Stockholm held a meeting at the office of the ''Stormklocken'' newspaper on July 3,&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher p.629&lt;/ref&gt; with representatives of the Soviets to attempt to clarify the situation. Present at this meeting were Linstrom, Lindhagen and Hoglund for Sweden; Olausen for Norway; Otto Lang for Switzerland; Karl Kautsky, Hugo Haase, [[Luise Zietz]], and Oskar Cohn for Germany; Sirola for Finland; Orlovsky, Radek and Hanecki for the Bolsheviks; [[Boris Reinstein]] for the US [[Socialist Labor Party of America|Socialist Labor Party]]; Kirkov for Bulgaria and Balabanoff in her capacity as secretary of the ISC.&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher p.630 Fainsod p.155 has Orlovsky, Radek and Hanecki representing "Russia and Poland"&lt;/ref&gt; The representatives of the Soviet were [[Joseph Goldenberg|Goldenberg]], [[Rozanov|Vladimir Rozanov]] and "Smirnov".&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher p.630 and Fainsod p.155 agree on the first two participants, but Fainsod has Zinoviev as the third Soviet representative, while Gankin and Fisher list "Smirnov". The Smirnov referred to, according to the index, was an alias of [[Gurevich|Emanual Gurevich]] who is listed as a Soviet representative to Stockholm in the appendix p. 784&lt;/ref&gt; At this meeting Balabanoff, Orlavsky and Reinstien stated their objections to the invitation of the majority Socialist parties to the proposed Stockholm conference. Goldberg replied that the proposed conference was open to socialist parties without conditions, and would include minorities as well as majorities. Radek re-emphasized the Bolshevik party's disapproval of the Stockholm Conference and the Party's determination to quit the Zimmerwald movement if the Third Zimmerwald Conference chose to participate. Haase, of the [[Independent Socialist Party of Germany]], however, was for the Conference and stated that his party would attend. Again, Balabanoff reminded everybody that no single party could dictate the ISCs position, which would be decided by the third Zimmerwald Conference. On the next day the conclave resumed, this time without the Soviet delegates. A statement was adopted in the name of the "Bureau of the International Socialist Commission" to the effect that the Third Zimmerwald Conference would take place five days before the proposed general Stockholm Conference, but should the conference not meet by September 15, 1917 the commission was empowered to call a conference of affiliates anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher p.630 Fainsod p. 156 include much the same information with an excerpt of the statement&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, once their meetings with the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee (the organization planning the Stockholm conference) were finished, the Soviet delegation tried once again to enlist the ISC in the preparation work for the Stockholm Conference. This meeting, held at the ISCs "quarters" was between Balabanoff, Hoglund and Carlson for the ISC and  [[Hendrik Ehrlich]] and another representative&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher p.639 Again, the sources are not exactly clear about who was present. Fainsod p. 156 has "Rosanoff, Rousanoff and Ehrlich". Gankin and Fisher have (translating Soviet report) "Rusanov (Rozanov) and Ehrlich" Index lists ''both'' Vladimir Nicolaevich Rosanov (b. 186) and Nicolai Sergeevich Rusanov(b. 1859) as being referred to on p.639. On p.631 editors refer only to a "Rusanov" as being present on July 9. Index says the man referred to on that page is N.S. Rusanov; incidentally index says man referred to on p.630 (as being present at July 3 meeting) and p.640 (as signing report of Soviet delegation) was V.N. Rosanov&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet delegation did not get a formal answer until July 11, when the ISC sent them a formal letter stating that they would not be able to participate in the preparations because the Stockholm Conference invitations had been "altered" to include the pro-war socialist parties and that the breaking of the "civil peace" was not a requirement of the parties to the conference&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher pp.634-636 Translation of a letter by Balabanoff. Both Balabanoffs letter and Radek at the July 3 conference made use of the Soviets letter to Vandervelde, Albert Thomas and Brouckere in a "peace without annexations" See also Gankin and Fisher p.637&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, according to Fainsod, there was another meeting of the ISC with Zimmerwaldists in Stockholm. Participants reported included Radek, [[Alexandra Kollontai]], Orowski, Martinov and Jermanski of Russia, "Mohr of Switzerland", [[Sirola]] of Finland, Storm and Kilborn of Sweden. Radek and Kollantai are supposed to have argued against going to the proposed Stockholm Conference while it was still reiterated that only the Third Zimmerwald Conference could decide that.&lt;ref&gt;Fainsod p.157, Gankin and Fisher don't mention it&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 18 Balabanoff did issue a revised invitation to the Third Zimmerwald Conference. The invitation gave the date as August 10, 1917 and included a provisional agenda, stated that the condition for participation were the same as those published in Bulletin #3 and also included an invitation to a socialist women's conference to be held in connection with the Zimmerwald conference&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher p.636-7 "In consideration of the growing significance of the proletarian women's movement for peace and socialism and the resulting urgent necessity of coordinating the class demands of the feminine proletarians of all countries on the basis of decisions of the [[International Socialist Women's Conferences|International Socialist Women's Conference at Berne, 1915]], we ask, in agreement with the International Secretary of the Socialist Women, Comrade [[Klara Zetkin]], the parties and organizations affiliated with us to delegate to the Third Zimmerwald Conference woman comrades or to induce the socialist women's organizations to elect delegates from their ranks to an international conference of socialist woman which is to be held in connection with the third Zimmerwald Conference" The invitation was included in the ''Nachrichtendienst'' of July 22, which may explain Fainsod putting the invitation on that date Fainsod p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1 another meeting of the ISC with Zimmerwald adherents in Stockholm decided to call the Third Zimmerwald Conference and meet in Stockholm on September 5 regardless of what happened to the movement for the proposed general Conference. The participants at this meeting included Lindhagen, Lindstorm, and Otto Strom of Sweden; Osip Arkadievich Ermanski of the Menshiviks; Yrjo Sirola of Finland; [[J. Eads How]] of the United States; Ledebour of Germany; and Radek and Hanecki "representing both the Bolsheviks and the Social Democracy of Poland and Lithuania"&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher p.631 J. Eads how is listed in the appendix as the leader of the "[[Brotherhood of Daily Life]]" Gankin and Fisher p.786&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the [[Third Zimmerwald Conference]] met at Stockholm on September 5–12, 1917. It had a smaller number of participants than any of the previous Zimmerwaldist Conferences, with only about thirty delegates from Russia, Germany, Poland, Finland, Rumania, Switzerland, the United States, Sweden and Norway, as well as the members of the ISC itself.&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher p.663-4, 674-5&lt;/ref&gt; By this point the question of attending the proposed general Stockholm Conference had been rendered practically moot because of the inability of the organizers to realize the project.&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher p.671&lt;/ref&gt; The question was discussed anyway because some delegates felt that the issues raised by the movement for the Stockholm Congress were of a "fundamental" nature and the proletarians needed to be educated as to why the proposal foundered. No resolution was passed on the issue, though the movement for the Stockholm Conference is condemned, in passing, in the Conferences manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher pp.671,681&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final months in Stockholm ==

The manifesto itself caused some trouble for the ISC. It was agreed that it would not be immediately released because it contained a call for co-ordinated [[mass action (sociology)|mass action]] against the war by the proletarians of all countries. The Conference felt it would be best to postpone publication until all the Zimmerwaldist groups had consented to this. A messenger was to memorize the text in English and go to London where he would deliver the manifesto orally. There it would be translated into French, memorized by another messenger who would travel to Paris. Meanwhile, on September 28, Louise Zeitz of the German Independent Socialists arrived in Stockholm and the ISC met to discuss her request that the publication of the manifesto be postponed further. The ISP had been getting into trouble lately because of [[mutinies]] in the [[German Imperial Navy|German navy]] led by alleged party members. The group's parliamentary leaders denied responsibility and pleaded that they were only for legal action. The publication of the manifesto at this time might lead to the dissolution of the party by the government. Karl Radek, on the other hand, argued for immediate publication. The Commission decided to postpone issuing the manifesto for the time being. The ISC would publish it only after personal or telegraphic communication with the ISP and, barring that, on its own discretion. Radek threatened to publish the manifesto himself—and he did so, in a Finnish newspaper that November.&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher pp.665-7 and Fainsod p.161&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISC held a meeting with a visiting Serb delegation on October 10. The Serbs were represented by Kaslerovic and Popvic. In addition to the Serbs, the following were present: Christian Rakovksy of Romania; [[Katerina Tinev]] of the Bulgarian Trade Union Federation and [[Kharlokov]] of the opposition with the "Broad" Bulgarian socialist party; Radek, Orlovsky and Haneki of the Bolsheviks; Yrjo Sirola of Finland and [[Fritz Rosen]] of the [[Socialist Propaganda League of America]]. No decisions or resolutions appear to have been made at this meeting. The Serb delegation were there to submit a memorandum to the Dutch-Scandinavian committee.&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher p.668 ''[https://archive.org/details/memorandumbyserb00part Memorandum by the Serbian socialist party upon the conditions in occupied Serbia ]'';'' [https://archive.org/details/lessouffrancesdu00part Les souffrances d'un peuple]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISC held two meetings on November 8, 1917, the day after the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik seizure of power in Petrograd]]. Present, beside the formal members of the Commission, were Radek, Racovsky, Tinev and Kharlakov. At the first it was moved that the ISC send a telegram of congratulations to the Petrograd Soviet in the name of all the affiliated parties. Racovsky protested against this, suggesting they wait until the situation in Russia was clear and all the parties were able to take a stand on what happened. He was overruled. Radek offered an already written appeal that he wanted issued jointly by the Bolsheviks and the ISC which urged workers around the world to strike and form soviets to defend the Russian revolution from counter-revolution and defend peace. It also asked all the parties which approved of the revolution to send delegates to Stockholm. This was approved. At a second meeting later that night the publication of the manifesto adopted at the Third Zimmerwald Conference was approved.&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher pp.383-384, text of appeal translated on pp. 691-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISC spent the remainder of its existence publishing its newsletter and other material supportive of the Bolshevik revolution. In March 1918 its published a special illustrated "Zimmerwald Russia Review", ''Frieden, Brot, Freiheit'' in twelve languages. It also published a pamphlet of Bukharin, ''Thesen über der sozialistische Revolution und die Aufgaben des Proletariats während seiner Diktatur in Russland''. The final issue of ''Nachrichten'' was published on September 1, 1918 and contained an appeal to the workers in German, French, Swedish, Italian and English. That month Balabanoff went on a tour of several countries to try to revive the influence of the ISC and fight off calls for its return to Switzerland. She was not especially successful, being expelled from Switzerland and denied reentry into Sweden. As secretary of the International Socialist Commission, she consented into its formal dissolution into the [[Communist International]] at its first congress in March 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Gankin and Fisher pp.385-388, Faisod pp. 206-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Two membership lists of organizations adhering to Zimmerwald were published in ''Bulletins'' #3 and #4. Not included in either lists were the opposition sections within the German and French socialist parties. Additionally, the Finnish Social Democrats adhered in the summer of 1917. There were also other groups whose allegiance to the ISC and Zimmerwald was ambiguous.

'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender''' ([[LGBT]]) people in [[Rio Grande do Sul]], Brazil enjoy many of the same legal protections available to non-LGBT people. Homosexuality is legal in the state.

==Recognition of same-sex unions==
On May 29, 2012, four of six notaries of the state capitol of [[Porto Alegre]] agreed to convert civil unions into marriages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zerohora.clicrbs.com.br/rs/geral/noticia/2012/05/casais-gays-encontram-facilidade-para-casar-no-rs-3773719.html Casais gays encontram facilidade para casar no RS - Geral - Zero Hora&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==LGBT adoption==
'''November 11, 2005''' − the first [[LGBT adoption]] in [[Brazil]], by a [[lesbian]] [[Intimate relationship|couple]] from the city of [[Bagé]]. The judge of the Childhood and Youth of Bagé, Marcos Danilo Edon Franco, permitted the adoption of two brothers by a lesbian couple. The women had been living in a stable union for seven years. One of them had been responsible for the guardianship of the boys since their birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conjur.com.br/2005-nov-11/juiz_permite_adocao_casal_mulheres_homossexuais Adoption by same-sex couples in Rio Grande do Sul {{pt icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''April 6, 2006''' − a second adoption by a lesbian couple, and one "provisional [[guardianship]]". Same-sex couples in committed relationships were allowed to [[Registered partnership|register]] at any [[notary public]] office. Although it did not affect [[Government of Brazil|federal]] [[rights]], it gave same-sex couples more [[Social equality|equality]] in many areas. Same-sex couples who register have the right to jointly own property, establish [[child custody|custody]] of children, and claim the right to pensions and property when one partner dies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/marriage_timeline.htm Adoption by same-sex couples in Rio Grande do Sul {{en icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5jitR7T5A?url=http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/marriage_timeline.htm |date=2009-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''June 10, 2009''' − a lesbian couple was the first to win in court the right of [[adoption]] in the Brazilian State of [[Goiás]]. Since April 2008, a [[Government of Brazil|federal]] [[employee]], 49, and a [[librarian]], 34, had [[Child custody|custody]] of a [[girl]] aged two years and ten months. The unprecedented decision was made by Judge Maurício Porfírio of the Juvenile Court of Childhood and Youth in [[Goiânia]]. To compensate for the lack of specific law on the issue, the magistrate relied on the precedent of the Court of Rio Grande do Sul.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mp.go.gov.br/portalweb/conteudo.jsp?page=11&amp;pageLink=1&amp;conteudo=noticia/7abaf9050b6798923e6412e4dafc671c.html Same-sex adoption in Goiás {{pt icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''April 27, 2010''' − the [[Superior Court of Justice (Brazil)|Superior Court of Justice of Brazil]], located in the [[capital (political)|capital]] of the country, [[Brasília]], decided to approve [[LGBT adoption]] in Brazil. In the case, a lesbian couple from the city of [[Bagé]] the [[physiotherapist]] Lídia Brignol Guterres and the [[psychologist]] Luciana Reis Maidana, had their [[rights|right]] to share the adoption of two sons recognized. They told the state that the [[Judgment (law)|decision]] could become a landmark, and could inspire others to follow suit. The physiotherapist and psychologist had been together for thirteen years and adopted two boys in 2002 and 2003. In official records, the children appeared only as children of Luciana. The couple decided to change the [[documentation]] to provide [[pension]] rights which apply to minors in cases of separation and [[inheritance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athosgls.com.br/noticias_visualiza.php?contcod=29214 Adoption by same-sex couple in Southern Brazil {{pt icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''June 3, 2011''' - the Justice of the city of [[Pelotas]] authorized the adoption of a four-year-old child by a gay couple. The biological mother, gave evidence demonstrating a desire to give her child up for adoption by the gay couple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/noticias/0,,OI5167735-EI8139,00-Justica+autoriza+casal+homossexual+a+adotar+menino+no+RS.html Gay couple adoption in Rio Grande do Sul {{pt icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Landesa Rural Development Institute''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] that partners with governments and local organizations to secure legal land rights for world's poorest families. Since 1967, Landesa has helped more than 100 million poor families in 35 countries gain legal control over their land. When families have secure rights to land, they can invest in their land to sustainably increase their harvests and reap the benefits—improved nutrition, health, education, and dignity.

Landesa partners with governments, world leaders, NGOs, foundations, donor agencies such as the [[World Bank]], [[USAID]], [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], the [[United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization]], and others to design and implement land laws, policies and programs that provide opportunity, further economic growth, and promote social justice through land rights.

Based in Seattle, Landesa has program offices in Beijing, China; Bhubaneswar, Delhi, Kolkata, Lucknow, and Patna, India; Yangon, Myanmar; and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. 
Landesa currently works in China, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Myanmar, Rwanda, and Tanzania.

== History ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Pattabyjoshfriedman.tif|thumb|left|An Indian government initiative with technical support by Landesa aims to provide 2 million landless families with secure access to land. With the legal documents that verify land ownership, families gain greater security and the ability to invest in their land, yielding increased income and better opportunities for their future. 
© Josh Fredman]] --&gt;

Landesa was founded as the Rural Development Institute in 1967 by Professor [[Roy Prosterman]], a [[Harvard Law School]] graduate who left his Wall Street career at [[Sullivan &amp; Cromwell]] to teach at the [[University of Washington]] School of Law where he established the Law in Sustainable Development Program.  Troubled by the escalating [[Vietnam War]], Prosterman recognized that secure land rights could provide the rural poor a place to grow food to feed their family and a foundation to raise themselves out of poverty without being forced to join the Viet Cong. His "land to the tiller" program led to a 30% increase in rice production, and an 80% decrease in Viet Cong recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;Prosterman, Roy. Asian Survey, Vol. 10, No.8,pg 751-764, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2642811 "Land-to-the-Tiller in South Vietnam: the Tables Turn"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prostermaninvietnam.jpg|thumb|right|Roy Prosterman works with Vietnamese farmers]]

==How Landesa Works==
Since its founding, Landesa has had one specific goal: securing land rights for the world's poorest people. This is because more than two billion people lives in extreme poverty, surviving on $2 a day or less. Of those, more than 75&amp;nbsp;percent live in rural areas and rely on agriculture for their sustenance. Most do not have secure rights to land and therefore, limited opportunity to build a better future for themselves and their family. True ownership of land in the developing world determines access to shelter, income, education, healthcare, and improves economic and nutritional security.

Landesa attorneys and land tenure specialists craft a variety of land and law-related institutional reforms to help developing countries bring land rights to their poorest. Upon the invitation of the host government, Landesa's staff conducts field assessments, institutional assessments, legislative drafting and policy advice. Landesa then provide assistance with implementing the new land laws, and can help organize pilot programs. Landesa has been involved - on five continents - with land administration consulting, social impact studies, implementation planning, implementation monitoring, training, public education programs, and program design and management. There are typically five primary elements to this work.

# Research in the field to identify existing conditions where new land law/regulations/policies could benefit the locals
# Design and develop laws and regulations that create and sustain improved land system programs
# Advocate the implications and details of the plan to public officials, future recipients, and other stake holders 
# Implement plan and assist in monitoring the changes; evaluate the new land system in place and make further modifications and improvements where appropriate
One plan will not work for every country, so most of Landesa's time goes into tailoring its work for each specific location. For instance, Landesa's "micro-land ownership" program in [[India]] provides landless families with a [[micro-plot]] as small as 1/10 of an acre on which they can build shelter, grow food to supplement the family diet and income, and raise livestock or start a micro-enterprise. Like the idea that started the "micro-credit" movement, "micro-land ownership" has the potential to provide opportunity for millions of the world's poorest.

==Consulting Services==
Landesa's fee-for-service practice focuses on the legal, policy, institutional, and educational issues of land tenure, land access, land market development, land conflicts, land acquisition and resettlement, and land registration systems.
[[File:Roy Helicopter.JPG|thumb]]
Landesa employs a staff of more than 120 worldwide, including over 20 senior land tenure specialists with legal, economic, gender, and agricultural expertise, complemented by a professional staff with livelihood, natural resource management, economics, sociology, and other social science expertise. Landesa also employs a team of research assistants who provide legal research and writing support.

Landesa's work focuses primarily on rural and peri-urban contexts in developing and transitional economies. Services include field assessments, institutional assessments, legislative drafting and policy advice, development of follow-on regulations, and procedures, technical support for legal assistance, social impact studies, implementation planning, implementation monitoring, training, public education programs, and program design and management.

==Global Center for Women's Land Rights==
Providing secure land rights to women is essential to addressing poverty and hunger around the world. Today, Landesa works in [[China]], [[India]] and post-conflict areas of [[Africa]] with a focus on women's land rights. Women comprise over 50% of the world's population, are responsible for 60-80% of the world's food production, yet, in many countries, they cannot inherit or own land.  
The Landesa Center for Women's Land Rights works to help women and girls transform their communities. There is great potential for change: with secure rights to land, women and girls can improve food security, education, health, and economic development for themselves and their families. When women have secure rights to land, they can become investors in their family's future and ensure that their children's needs are met.

Studies have found that when women have secure rights to land:

*  Family nutrition and health improve
*  Women are less likely to contract and spread HIV/AIDS and are better able to cope with the effects of AIDS
*  Women are less likely to be victims of domestic violence
*  Children are more likely to get an education and stay in school longer
*  Women may have better access to micro-credit

In short, investing in women's land rights creates an ripple effect that spreads to her family, village, and beyond. 
However, in much of the world, while women shoulder the burden of food production, they often don't have secure rights to the land they farm. Although they till the fields, they are often barred from inheriting or owning those fields, a prerogative usually left for their husbands and fathers.

To address these challenges and unite the global community in support of women's land rights, the Landesa Center for Women's Land Rights was launched in 2009. Landesa's Center provides resources and training on women's land rights and connects policymakers, researchers, and practitioners from around the world. Landesa's Center pilots solutions to women's lack of secure land rights. It educates development experts about the gap between customary and institutional law and ensures that this is addressed in Landesa's projects. Landesa's Center ensures that women remain a core focus of Landesa's work to help the world's poorest.

=== Current Initiatives ===

====Global Fellowship Program====
Landesa's Global Fellowship Program provides training opportunities for qualified professionals seeking to pursue a career in helping to secure land and property rights for women and girls. The program is designed to provide a career path and specialized training opportunities for legal professionals in the U.S., experienced professionals in developing countries who could benefit from comparative experience, and experienced non-legal professionals from NGOs who seek comparative legal knowledge.

====e-Library on Women's Property Rights====
Landesa's Global Center for Women's Land Rights is building a database of formal laws related to women's land rights from every country in the world. This "e-library" will also include research on customary law related to women's land rights where available. The e-Library on women's property rights will be an open-source platform, allowing users to share and post laws and related materials on how those laws are practiced thorough a discussion forum. The e-Library will be cross-referenced via topics (widows' rights, dowry, girls' inheritance, etc.) as well as by countries and regions in a variety of languages. This helps legal practitioners and women's advocates create more effective and suitable programming.

====Girls and Land====
Daughters do not traditionally inherit land, because they typically move away from the village to their husband's home after marriage.  Most girls leave their family homes with no economic asset of their own (such as land), leaving them vulnerable and powerless in their new homes.  To address this, Landesa is working in partnership with its partners to help girls gain a critical economic asset—land—to reduce their vulnerability to poverty, gender-based violence, HIV, early marriage, and trafficking, and to gain opportunities for a better future.

== Feedback and Praise ==
"Forty years ago, Roy Prosterman was struck by the non-apparent truth that what keeps the world's poorest people poor is their inability to own the land they work. Since then, he and [Landesa] (RDI at the time) have shown what wonders can be wrought from a piece of land when the people who till it, own it."
- [[Bill Gates]], Sr. • Co-chair, [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]]

"The advice of the Rural Development Institute has been more valuable than any foreign technical advice I have received."
- Bekbolot Talgarbekov • Former Minister of Agriculture, [[Republic of Kyrgyzstan]]

"RDI's valuable recommendations have aroused the attention of party and government leaders within China's central government. . . . They have been extremely impressed by RDI's unique work methods and focus on providing practical recommendations to existing problems."
- Chen Xiwen • Director, Rural Work Group State Council, [[People's Republic of China]]

"At the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, we boast that we have helped over 800,000,000 out of poverty; RDI alone has been responsible for half of those."
- [[Pamela Hartigan]] • Managing Director, [[Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5512">[[File:Leaina Before the Judges, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|upright|''Leaina Before the Judges'', by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], ''c.''&amp;nbsp;1517–18]]

'''Leaina''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Λέαινα}}, "lioness") was a [[hetaera]] and the [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] of [[Aristogeiton the Tyrannicide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attalus.org/translate/polyaenus8B.html#45.1 Polyaenus, ''Stratagems'', 8.45]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 514 B.C., [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton]] were inspired to overthrow the tyranny of [[Hippias (son of Pisistratus)|Hippias]] and [[Hipparchus (son of Peisistratos)|Hipparchus]] at Athens.

Hipparchus was murdered, but Hippias escaped, and seized the surviving conspirators. Among those captured was the hetaera Leaina, lover of Aristogeiton, or Harmodius, or both. Leaina was tortured to get information about the conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6156/6156-h/vol1.htm Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Athens: Its Rise and Fall, Volume I, Book II, Chapter III, Section III]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], the [[Athenians]] later set up a statue of a bronze lioness on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] in her memory: "When Hipparchus died, Hippias tortured Leaena to death, because he knew she was the mistress of Aristogeiton, and therefore could not possibly, he held, be in ignorance of the plot. As a recompense, when the tyranny of the Peisistratidae was at an end, the Athenians put up a bronze lioness in memory of the woman, which they say [[Callias]] dedicated and [[Calamis (5th century BC)|Calamis]] made."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+1.23.1 1.23.1&amp;ndash;2].&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaina was commemorated on account of her stubborn resolve under the torture of the tyrant.  Athenaeus (who believed Leaina's lover was Harmodius) says: "There was also a courtesan named Leaena, whose name is very celebrated, and she was the mistress of Harmodius, who slew the tyrant. And she, being tortured by command of Hippias the tyrant, died under the torture without having said a word." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attalus.org/old/athenaeus13c.html#596 Athenaeus, ''Deipnosophists'', 13.596.f]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jerome, Leaina rose to the occasion even further; to preserve her silence, and to frustrate her torturers, she bit her tongue off, and so died: "Harmodius and Aristogiton killed the tyrant Hipparchus, and the courtesan Leaena their friend, when compelled with torments, lest she betray her companions, she amputated her tongue with her teeth." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_03_part2.htm Beginning of the Consuls of the Romans]&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the brass lioness statue at the entrance to the Acropolis was without a tongue: "And Leaena also has a splendid reward for her self-control. She was a courtesan belonging to the group led by Harmodius and Aristogeiton and shared in the conspiracy against the tyrants — with her hopes, all a woman could do; for she also had joined in the revels about that noble mixing-bowl of Eros and through the god had been initiated into the secrets which might not be revealed. When, therefore, the conspirators failed and were put to death, she was questioned and commanded to reveal those who still escaped detection; but she would not do so and continued steadfast, proving that those men had experienced a passion not unworthy of themselves in loving a woman like her. And the Athenians caused a bronze lioness without a tongue to be made and set up in the gates of the Acropolis, representing by the spirited courage of the animal Leaena's invincible character, and by its tonguelessness her power of silence in keeping a holy secret. "&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/De_garrulitate*.html#T505e ''On Talkativeness''], [[Moralia]] 505.E&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue was not made by Calamis but by the Athenian sculptor Amphicrates, according to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]].&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0158.html Amphicrates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012050811/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0158.html |date=2012-10-12 }} at the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1954">'''Luis Rebolledo de Palafox y Melci, 1st [[marquis|marqués]] de Lazán''' (June 2, 1772, [[Zaragoza]] &amp;ndash; December 28, 1843, [[Madrid]]) was an  [[Spain|Aragonese]] [[officer (military)|officer]] and [[general]] during the [[Peninsular War|Spanish War of Independence]]. Alongside his brother [[José de Palafox y Melzi, Duke of Saragossa|José de Palafox]], the ''Duke of Saragossa'', Lazán was a [[Folk hero|national hero]] in 19th century Spain for his [[Siege of Saragossa (1809)|defence of Saragossa]] from the [[France|French]] [[First French Empire|Imperial]] armies in 1808 and 1809.

Lazán was born to Juan Felipe Rebolledo de Palafox and [[doña]] Paula Melci de Eril and educated at the ''[[Escuelas Pías]]'' in [[Zaragoza]]. In 1809 he commanded an army in the campaign for [[Catalonia]], winning a notable success at [[Battle of Castellón|Castellón]]. Upon the [[Mid-nineteenth century Spain|restoration]] of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] to the [[Spanish Crown]] in 1814 ([[Treaty of Valençay]]), Lazán aligned himself with the [[reactionary]] party defending Ferdinand's [[absolute monarchy]] and opposing the [[liberalism|liberal]] [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Constitution of 1812]]. From 1815 to 1820 Lazán served as [[Captain General]] of [[Aragon]].

The '''Ministry of Trade''' of [[Iraq]] is a conglomeration of state-owned enterprises and operates a nearly $6bn annual budget that provides a monthly public food distribution programme for Iraqis. It also manages the import of grain, seeds and construction materials.

While Iraq is potentially a rich country with huge oil deposits, decades of wars and sanctions have led to the collapse of infrastructure and social services, – which has resulted in many people being left without sufficient food or nutrition. A 2008 survey estimated that 930,000 Iraqis were food insecure, with a further 6.4 million vulnerable to food security without the Public Distribution System (PDS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfp.org/news/news-release/wfp-and-iraqi-trade-ministry-form-partnership-strengthen-food-distribution-capacity |title=and Iraqi Trade Ministry Form Partnership to Strengthen Food Distribution Capacity &amp;#124; WFP &amp;#124; United Nations World Food Programme - Fighting Hunger Worldwide |publisher=WFP |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Iraq's food rationing system was established in 1995 as part of the [[United Nations]] [[Oil-for-Food Programme]] following Iraq's invasion of [[Kuwait]] in 1990. Under the Public Distribution System (PDS) every Iraqi, irrespective of income level, is entitled to a monthly food ration for a nominal fee. Most of the Ministry's 3000 trucks and 400 warehouses are dedicated to the PDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careers.state.gov/iraq-jobs/ministries.html#TRD |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707211739/http://careers.state.gov/iraq-jobs/ministries.html |archivedate=July 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the programme has been plagued by mismanagement and corruption since the 2003 US-led invasion.  With annual costs running at more than US$4 billion, the Iraqi government is looking at ways to reform the system to target only the most vulnerable people in need of such assistance.

Anti-corruption officials and the Iraqi army went to the ministry's offices in central [[Baghdad]] on April 29, 2009 to detain nine people on corruption charges. Their attempted roundup triggered a 15-minute gunfight between the military and the minister's security team. Only the minister's spokesman, Mohammed Hanoun was detained. Two of Sudani's brothers, one who worked for the ministry and one who headed the Iraqi Grain Board, were arrested the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h5M3YtLQT-dauxkvJU9U0SOn8y0w |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524163118/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h5M3YtLQT-dauxkvJU9U0SOn8y0w |archivedate=May 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009 Iraqi Trade Minister [[Abdel Falah al-Sudani]] resigned and was later arrested amid allegations of corruption and embezzlement linked to the nation's food assistance programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8075158.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Dramatic plane arrest of ex-Iraq minister |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2009-05-30 |accessdate=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sudani, a member of Prime Minister [[Nuri al-Maliki]]'s Shiite Dawa faction, had been questioned by parliament over claims relating to imports for Iraq's food rationing programme. The minister was accused of importing expired commodities—sugar—and procuring illegal contracts as well as failing to fight corruption in his ministry.

In December 2009 the [[United Nations World Food Programme]] and Iraqi Ministry of Trade signed a 'Memorandum of Understanding' under which the two parties agreed to work together to improve the supply chain management of the Public Distribution System (PDS) which provides a monthly food ration to millions of Iraqis. The agreement was signed in Baghdad by Edward Kallon and the Iraqi Minister of Trade, Dr Safa Al-Deen Alsafi.

==Mission statement==
The official stated purpose of the Iraqi Ministry of Trade is to facilitate and promote trade and commerce in Iraq.  It aims to encourage private sector development by removing regulations blocking trade and investment, eliminating import licensing rules, and embarking on wide-ranging projects to promote a new trading environment in Iraq: an anti-corruption drive, a consumer welfare and protection unit, a “Baghdad International Fair" site and the leasing of Iraqi shopping centers to private developers.

==Associated Companies==
The Iraqi Ministry of Trade has number of associated State Companies: Iraqi Fairs, Food Stuff Trading, Constructions Stuff Trading, Grains Production, Grains Trading, Central Markets and Vehicles and Machines Trading.  In addition, there are also a number of 'directorates' for Private Sector Development, Planning and Purveying, Administrative and Financial Affairs, Economic and Foreign Affairs and the Registration of Companies Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iraqifairs.com/mot.htm |title=HugeDomains.com - IraqiFairs.com is for sale |publisher=Iraqi Fairs |date= |accessdate=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26456">The '''Nile Basin Initiative (NBI)''' is a partnership among the [[Nile]] riparian states that “seeks to develop the river in a cooperative manner, share substantial socioeconomic benefits, and promote regional peace and security”. The NBI began with a dialogue among the riparian states that resulted in a shared vision objective “to achieve sustainable socioeconomic development through the equitable utilization of, and benefit from, the common Nile Basin water resources."&lt;ref name="NBI Background"&gt;[http://www.nilebasin.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=42 Nile Basin Initiative:Background]&lt;/ref&gt; It was formally launched in February 1999&lt;ref name="NBI Background"/&gt; by the water ministers of nine countries that share the river: [[Egypt]], [[Sudan]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[Burundi]], [[Rwanda]], the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (DRC), as well as [[Eritrea]] as an observer. From its beginning the Nile Basin Initiative has been supported by the [[World Bank]] and by other external partners. The World Bank has a mandate to support the work of the NBI, as lead development partner and as administrator of the multi-donor Nile Basin Trust Fund.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank, 2010, pgs. 90-95 {{cite web|url=http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/sustaining-water-all-changing-climate-world-bank-group-implementation-progress-report |title=Sustaining water for all in a changing climate: World Bank Group Implementation Progress Report |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the partners is the "Nile Basin Discourse", which describes itself as "a civil society network of organisations seeking to achieve positive influence over the development of projects and programmes under the Nile Basin Initiative".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nilebasindiscourse.org/ Nile Basin Discourse]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, five upstream states signed a Cooperative Framework Agreement to seek more water from the River Nile — a move strongly opposed by Egypt and Sudan.&lt;ref name="BBC May 14"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8682387.stm BBC:East Africa seeks more Nile water from Egypt], 14 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania were original signatories with Burundi signing in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[]http://www.nilebasin.org/newsite/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=70%3Aburundi-signs-the-nile-cooperative-framework-agreement-pdf&amp;catid=40%3Alatest-news&amp;Itemid=84&amp;lang=en Nile Basin - Burundi's signature in Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The DRC is also expected to sign, while Egypt and Sudan are not expected to do so. Representatives of upstream countries said they were "tired of first getting permission from Egypt before using river Nile water for any development project like irrigation", as required by a treaty signed during the colonial era between Egypt and Britain in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.afrik.com/article17639.html Ethiopian led river Nile agreement signed without Egypt and Sudan], 14 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The new agreement, once effective, is designed to replace the Nile Basin Initiative.

== Institutional framework ==

The NBI institutional framework consists of three key institutions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nilebasin.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=30&amp;Itemid=77 Nile Basin Initiative:Organizational Structure]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The '''Nile Council of Ministers''' of Water Affairs provides policy guidance and makes decisions. Its Chairpersonship is on a rotational one-year basis. The host of the regular council meetings is traditionally elected as the Chair for the forthcoming year. Since June 2010 the chair is [[Asfaw Dingamo]], Ethiopia’s Minister of Water Resources, elected at the 18th regular meeting  in Addis Ababa in June 2010. He was preceded by Egypt’s Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation, [[Mohamed Nasr el Din Allam]] (2009–10), elected at the 17th regular meeting in Alexandria in July 2009, as well as [[Jose Endundu]], Minister Of Environment of the Democratic Republic of Congo (2008–09) and Minister Of Water and Environment of Uganda, [[Maria Mutagamba]] (2007–2008). The council holds regular annual meetings as well as extradordinary meetings. Extraordinary meetings were held in May 2009 in Kinshasa and in April 2010 in Sharm el-Sheikh.
* The '''NBI Technical Advisory Committee''', established in 1998. It is made up of senior civil servants and provides technical advice and assistance to the Council of Ministers. The committee is made up of one representative from each riparian country and one alternate. It meets two to three times a year.
*The '''NBI Secretariat''', established in 1999 provides administrative support to the Council of Ministers and the Technical Advisory Committee. It is based in Entebbe, Uganda, headed by an Executive Director. The position is on a rotational basis for a 2-year term. The current Executive Director, Teferra Beyene Asfaw from Ethiopia, assumed office in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Nile Basin Initiative:[http://www.nilebasin.org/newsite/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=141%3Aintroducing-the-nbi-new-executive-director-a-head-of-strategic-planning&amp;catid=40%3Alatest-news&amp;Itemid=84&amp;lang=en], retrieved on March 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Two subsidiary programs are managed by the '''Eastern Nile Regional Technical Office''' (ENTRO), which is based in Addis Ababa, and the '''NELSAP Coordinating Unit''' (NELSAP-CU), which is based in Kigali, Rwanda. In addition, various projects under the Share Vision Program have regional project management units located in Cairo (applied training), Addis Ababa (water resources planning), Dar es-Salaam (power trade) and Nairobi (agriculture).

== Main programs ==

The NBI consists of three main programs: The Shared Vision Program, the Eastern Nile Subsidiary Action Program and the Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary Action Program.

=== The Shared Vision Program ===

The Shared Vision Program (SVP),  “a Basin-wide program that focuses on building institutions, sharing data and information, providing training and creating avenues for dialogue and region-wide networks needed for joint problem-solving, collaborative development, and developing multi-sector and multi-country programs of investment to develop water resources in a sustainable way.” It is financed through grants and aims to foster trust to build an enabling environment for investment. In 2010 it included the following eight projects mainly focused on regional training:

* an Applied Training Project that provides training in [[Integrated Water Resources Management]];
* a Confidence-Building and Stakeholder Involvement Project that "is working to increase the involvement of a broad range of stakeholders—from policy and decision makers, to small business men and women, to fishermen and farmers, to religious and youth groups";
* a Regional Power Trade Project;
* a Transboundary Environmental Action Project that "provides training in environmental management and monitoring, water quality monitoring, and wetlands conservation";
* an Efficient Water Use for Agriculture Project;
* a Water Resources Management Project;
* a Socio-economic and Benefits Sharing Project that builds a "network of professionals from economic planning and research institutions, technical experts from both the public and private sectors, academics, sociologists, and representatives from civic groups and NGOs";
* a Shared Vision Coordination Project.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank:[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/EXTREGINI/EXTAFRNILEBASINI/0,,contentMDK:21175378~menuPK:3427090~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:2959951,00.html Shared Vision Projects], retrieved on October 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Eastern Nile Subsidiary Action Program ===

The '''Eastern Nile Subsidiary Action Program''' (ENSAP) "seeks to develop the water resources of the [[Blue Nile|Eastern Nile]] Basin in a sustainable and equitable way to ensure prosperity, security and peace for all its peoples". It is managed by the Eastern Nile Technical Regional Office (ENTRO) based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It is grouped into fast-track investments and more complex, longer-term multi-purpose track investments.

==== Fast-track investments ====

This track included four projects in early 2008:&lt;ref name="ENSAP"&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/EXTREGINI/EXTAFRNILEBASINI/0,,contentMDK:21089139~menuPK:3427116~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:2959951,00.html World Bank:ENSAP investment projects]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Regional '''Watershed Management Project''' aims to establish sustainable [[Watershed management|management of watersheds]] on the [[Tekeze River|Tekeze]], [[Atbarah River|Atbara]], [[Mareb River|Mareb]], [[Abbay River|Abbay]]/[[Blue Nile]] and the [[Baro River|Baro]]/[[Akobo River|Akobo]]/[[Sobat River|Sobat]] rivers in Ethiopia and Sudan. The initial project sites identified include [[Lake Nasser]]/[[Nubia]] in Egypt; [[Jamma River|Jamma]], [[Reb River|Reb]], and [[Gumara River|Gumara]] sub-basins, as well as watershed management in [[Lake Tana|Tana]]-[[Beles River|Beles]] as part of the Tana-Beles Integrated Water Resources Development Project in Ethiopia; and the lower Atbara, [[Ingessena]] Mountains and areas around [[Dinder River|Dinder National Park]] in Sudan. 

The '''Ethiopia Power Export Project'''  (formerly called the Ethiopia-Sudan Internconnection Project) will connect the power grids of Ethiopia and Sudan to facilitate cross-border [[Electricity market|energy trade]] and optimize existing and planned generation capacity. It aims to overcome the severe electricity shortage in both countries. The World Bank is providing a US$ 41 million credit for investments in Ethiopia approved in 2007. The Government of Sudan is funding activities in Sudan.   

The Regional '''Irrigation and Drainage Project''' aims to develop and expand irrigated agriculture and improve the productivity of existing agriculture through more efficient use of water. It consists of three national sub-projects: 

* Egypt West [[Nile delta|Delta]] Water Conservation and Irrigation Rehabilitation Project supported by a US$ 145 million loan from the World Bank approved in 2007
* Ethiopia Irrigation and Drainage Project, supported by a US$ 100 million World Bank subsidized credit approved in 2007, including for investments in the Reb and [[Magech River|Magech]] drainage areas in the [[Amhara Region]] (Lake Tana basin).
* Sudan Upper [[Atbarah River|Atbara]] Irrigation Project
       
The '''Flood Preparedness and Early Warning Project''', a US$ 4 million project approved in 2007 with an expected duration of three years, will focus on building [[flood forecasting]] capabilities and flood emergency preparedness and response. This will include efforts to improve dissemination of [[flood warning]] information to communities at risk, strengthen existing institutions and mechanisms to alert communities; establish community-based plans to reduce flood damages and capture environmental benefits; deliver public education programs; and develop regional and local [[emergency preparedness]] and response plans.

==== Multi-purpose track  ====

The multi-purpose track includes a series of studies aimed at developing common analytical tools, as well as a tentative plan for coordinated investments called the Joint Multipurpose Program.&lt;ref name="ENSAP"/&gt;

===== Development of common analytical tools =====

Specific common analytical tools will be developed for the power sector, watershed management and irrigation/drainage, integrated by an overall planning model.
  
*The '''Watershed Management Cooperative Regional Assessment''' is considered by the World Bank to be a critical building block for determining future regional watershed investments. The study will build a shared information base from which to assess impacts of different land management interventions on a regional scale. This assessment will include a transboundary analysis of the Eastern Nile watershed system and associated livelihoods and analyze how benefits accrue across the three countries under alternative watershed management interventions.
*The '''Eastern Nile Power Trade Investment Project''' is part of the overall effort to promote regional power trade by coordinating the planning and development of power projects and transmission interconnection across the three Eastern Nile countries. This study includes an assessment of the scope and potential of an Eastern Nile power market, potential power generation options in the three countries, potential sites for transmission interconnection, and potential power trading arrangements.
*The '''Irrigation and Drainage Cooperative Regional Assessment''' includes both regional studies of irrigation and development opportunities, as well as engineering studies of specific sites. The regional study seeks to develop guidelines for selection of projects of regional interest, quantify the benefits and costs of irrigation projects from national and regional perspectives, and explore institutional and legislative reform options to harmonize the approach to rural development and facilitate regional cooperation.
*The '''Eastern Nile Planning Model''' Project is intended to help Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan identify, prepare, and implement cooperative development projects that benefit all three countries.

===== Joint Multipurpose Program =====

The Joint Multipurpose Program (JMP) is a long-term program with a 25-30 year horizon that includes a coordinated set of investments to ensure the sustainable development and management of shared Eastern Nile waters, including the Abbay ([[Blue Nile]]), [[Tekezé River|Tekeze]] (Setit)-[[Atbarah River|Atbara]], [[Baro River|Baro]]-[[Akobo River|Akobo]]-[[Sobat River|Sobat]], portions of the White Nile and the Main Nile. The first set of investments under the program is likely to include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/EXTREGINI/EXTAFRNILEBASINI/0,,contentMDK:21089637~isCURL:Y~menuPK:3427116~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:2959951,00.html World Bank: Joint Multipurpose Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Watershed and environmental management''', including [[reforestation]], river bank [[erosion control]], and creation of alternative livelihoods.
*'''Linking river and power systems''' through an infrastructure backbone including a regional power grid and increase capacity for water storage for [[flood control]], [[hydropower]], [[irrigation]] and water conservation. Other potential benefits include improved [[inland navigation]], more productive [[Fishery|fisheries]] and sufficient flows of water to maintain critical [[Aquatic ecosystem|ecosystems]].
*'''Enhancing agricultural production''' through intensified and expanded irrigated agriculture, coupled with targeted investments in [[agribusiness]], marketing, and other agricultural support services. Improved watershed management would also help expand [[rainwater harvesting]], improve [[livestock]] productivity, and promote fisheries development.
*'''Complementary investments to leverage growth and promote regional integration''', such as in telecommunications, transport, industry, tourism, and credit systems.
*'''Establishing institutions for joint action''', including innovative approaches to financing, shared information systems, and improved public communication and transparency.

=== The Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary Action Program ===

The Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary Action Program (NELSAP) “is an investment program under the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI). Its mission is to help reduce poverty, promote economic growth, and reverse environmental degradation.” NELSAP programs fall under two broad program areas: Natural Resources Management and Development, and Power Development and Trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/EXTREGINI/EXTAFRNILEBASINI/0,,contentMDK:21076148~isCURL:Y~menuPK:3426445~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:2959951,00.html World Bank: NELSAP]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Natural Resources Management and Development ====

This program area includes the following projects:&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/EXTREGINI/EXTAFRNILEBASINI/0,,contentMDK:21184240~menuPK:3427155~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:2959951,00.html World Bank: NELSAP Natural Resources Management and Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Kagera River|Kagera]] Transboundary Integrated Water Resources Management and Development project launched in December 2005. The project is shared between Burundi, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda.
*The Mara Transboundary Integrated Water Resources Management and Development project in the [[Masai Mara|Mara]] and the [[Serengeti]] national parks launched effective January 2006. It is shared between Tanzania and Kenya.
*The Sio-Malaba-Malakisi Transboundary Integrated Water Resources Management and Development project shared by Kenya and Uganda focuses on promoting development and reducing conflicts between communities using water resources of the three sub basins fed from the slopes of [[Mount Elgon]]. The project was launched in January 2006.
*The [[Lake Edward]] and [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]] Fisheries Pilot Project in Uganda and the DemocraticRepublic of Congo, including  small-scale community-level investments to improve protection of water catchment areas, build access roads, and supply drinking water and sanitation. The project was launched in June 2005 and was scheduled to be completed in 2007. The African Development Bank is providing financial support for this project.
*The Abatement of the [[Water Hyacinth]] on the Kagera River Project, part of the [[Lake Victoria]] Environmental Management Project in partnership with Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda.

==== Power Development and Trade ====

This program area focuses on investment planning and preparation of major investment projects such as a Transmission Interconnection project and the Regional [[Rusumo Falls]] Hydro-electric and Multi-purpose Project. This has involved carrying out preliminary feasibility studies and assessments.

In December 2005 the six NELSAP Ministers responsible for Electricity Affairs adopted an Indicative Power Master Plan for the region. The plan includes a set of “best evaluated” power generation options and transmission interconnection projects for the next 20 years, including social and environmental concerns.

The Regional [[Rusumo Falls]] Hydroelectric and Multipurpose Project on the Kagera River is expected to be a [[dam]] with an associated [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run-of-the river hydropower plant]] that is expected to benefit Burundi, Rwanda and Tanzania. The project was identified as one of the best power options through the above-mentioned NELSAP Assessment of Power Development Options. The hydroelectric power component would have an installed capacity of approximately 60-80 megawatts. It is estimated that approximately 3,000 people would need to be resettled around the hydropower plant facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/EXTREGINI/EXTAFRNILEBASINI/0,,contentMDK:21184277~menuPK:3427171~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:2959951,00.html World Bank: NELSAP Power Development and Trade]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afdb.org/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/ADB_ADMIN_PG/DOCUMENTS/OPERATIONSINFORMATION/RUSUMO%20FALLS%20%20POWER%20TRANSMISSION%20LINES%20STUDY.PDF AfDB:Study on Power Transmission Lines related to the Rusomo Falls HYdropower Station]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NELSAP Transmission Interconnection feasibility studies include detailed design for four key transmission lines between Burundi, DRC, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, supported directly by the [[African Development Bank]]. The total cost of the regional transmission lines are about US$160 Million.

== Funding ==

The Nile Basin Initiative is supported by contributions from the NBI countries themselves and through the support of international financial institutions – such as the [[World Bank]], the [[Global Environmental Facility]] and the [[African Development Bank]] – and other donors. In 2003 a World Bank-managed, multi-donor trust fund created to harmonize donor contributions. Donors that contributed through the Nile Basin Trust Fund until early 2008 include Canada, Denmark, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Other donors to the NBI include Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Estonia, the EU and various UN agencies such as [[UNDP]] and the [[FAO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nilebasin.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=43&amp;Itemid=97 NBI: How we are funded]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until early 2008 donors have contributed over US$130 million of the original pledge of US$150 million. US$14.4 million has been contributed by the governments of the Nile Basin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nilebasin.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=98 NBI Partners]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initiative by upstream countries to form a Nile River Basin Commission ==

In May 2010 five upstream states signed an agreement to seek more water from the River Nile — a move strongly opposed by Egypt and Sudan.&lt;ref name="BBC May 14"/&gt; The Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA), which had been negotiated for years under the framework of the NBI, was to be open for signature for a period of one year.&lt;ref name="News Dire"&gt;NewsDire - Ethiopian News Service:[http://www.newsdire.com/news/802-ethiopia-agreement-on-the-nile-river-basin-cooperative-framework.html Ethiopia: Agreement on the Nile River Basin Cooperative Framework], 16 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania signed the agreement; Ethiopia ratified it in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;''Ethiopia Ratifies River Nile Treaty amid Egypt Tension'', BBC News (June 13, 2013, 10:49 ET), https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22894294.&lt;/ref&gt; The DR Congo is also expected to sign, while Egypt and Sudan are not expected to do so. An Egyptian government spokesman said in May 2010 that "Egypt will not join or sign any agreement that affects its share."&lt;ref name="BBC May 14"/&gt;

The signing of the agreement had already been planned during a Ministerial meeting in 2007, but had been delayed at the request of Egypt.&lt;ref name="All Africa February 2009"/&gt; Upstream countries then decided at another Ministerial meeting in Kinshasa in May 2009 to sign the agreement without having all countries sign at the same time. However, the signing was delayed and at the next Council of Minister meeting in April 2010 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt again asked to defer the signing. The article on water security (Article 14b) has particularly drawn objections from Egypt and Sudan. The article says that member countries would work together to ensure "not to ''significantly'' affect the water security of any other Nile Basin State." Egypt and Sudan want the article to read "Not to adversely affect the water security and current uses and rights of any other Nile Basin States" without the qualification "significantly".&lt;ref name="All Africa February 2009"/&gt; A former Egyptian minister of water resources and irrigation, Mahmoud Abu-Zeid, sees the framework agreement as a positive beginning, saying that "everybody agreed to more than 95 percent of the articles".&lt;ref&gt;Ashenafi Abedje, [[Voice of America]]:[http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/east/Nile-Series-Overview-11March11-118252974.html Nile River Countries Consider Cooperative Framework Agreement], March 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; An article on the protection and conservation of the basin and its ecosystem - such as the [[Sudd]] in Sudan - and an article requiring "[[prior informed consent]]" before building new dams had also been controversial during earlier negotiations.&lt;ref name="All Africa February 2009"&gt;AllAfrica.com:[http://allafrica.com/stories/200902230029.html Rift Widens as Egypt, Sudan Delay Signing Nile Basin Pact], 23 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives of upstream countries said they were "tired of first getting permission from Egypt before using river Nile water for any development project like irrigation", as required by a treaty signed during the colonial era between Egypt and Britain in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Afrik.com:[http://en.afrik.com/article17639.html Ethiopian led river Nile agreement signed without Egypt and Sudan], 14 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
The agreement does not include fixed water shares for each riparian country. The agreement, once effective, will transform the NBI into a permanent Nile River Basin Commission.

'''#NotAllMen''' is a popular [[Internet meme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tom|last=Ferdy |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/10924854/Is-there-a-misogynist-inside-every-man.html |title=Is there a misogynist inside every man? |website=[[Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |location=London, England|date=2 July 2014|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jezebel/&gt; It is a shortened [[hashtag]] version of the phrase '''not all men are like that''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mina|last=Malik-Hussain|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/columns/02-Jun-2014/clapping-with-both-hands|title=Clapping with Both Hands|work=[[The Nation (Pakistan)|The Nation]]||publisher=Nawa-i-Waqt Group of Publications|location=Karachi, Pakistan|date=June 2, 2014|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes abbreviated '''NAMALT'''.

A [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]] article on the subject states that "Not all men" was previously stated as an object of frustration, but in early 2014 it became usually used as an object of mockery. Intended to counter [[generalization]]s about men’s behavior, the phrase has been criticized for deflecting conversations from uncomfortable topics, such as [[sexual assault]].&lt;ref name="Jess Zimmerman"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jess|last=Zimmerman |url=http://time.com/79357/not-all-men-a-brief-history-of-every-dudes-favorite-argument/ |title=Not All Men: A Brief History of Every Dude's Favorite Argument |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=April 28, 2014|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Michel|last1=Martin|first2=Arthur|last2= Chu|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/05/30/317361633/jeopardy-champ-arthur-chu-on-nerds-entitlement-and-elliot-rodger|title=Jeopardy Champ Arthur Chu On Nerds, Entitlement And Elliot Rodger |work=[[NPR]]|date=May 30, 2014|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[Vox (website)|Vox]] states that the phrase "not all men are like that," as a general defense of men in gendered criticisms of their behavior, has been around for more than a decade.&lt;ref name="vox.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Kelsey|last=McKinney|title=Here's why women have turned the "not all men" objection into a meme|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/5/15/5720332/heres-why-women-have-turned-the-not-all-men-objection-into-a-meme|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|It has been used as early as 1836 in author [[Charles Dickens]]' book ''The Pickwick Papers'', in which, in response to the statement "Men are such deceivers" by Miss Wardle, Mr. Tupman replies "They are, they are, but not all men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles|last=Dickens|authorlink=Charles Dickens|title=The Pickwick Papers|publisher=Hueber|location=Munich, Germany|date=1905|isbn=978-1718847675|title-link=The Pickwick Papers}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Before 2013, "not all men" was not seen as a derailment tactic; the most common strategies cited by feminist bloggers were "'what about the men?' and 'patriarchy hurts men too'—pleas for inclusion, not for exemption".&lt;ref name="Jess Zimmerman"/&gt; Jasmine Bailey says the "not all men" argument "seemingly began as a sincere way to counter feminist arguments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jasmine|last=Bailey|title=What’s up with the #YesAllWomen and #NotAllMen hashtags?|url=http://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/news/whats-yesallwomen-and-notallmen-hashtags/nf7LF/|website=[[Springfield News-Sun]]|publisher=[[Cox Enterprises]]|location=Springfield, Ohio|date=May 25, 2014|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; #NotAllMen, however, is often impugned by [[feminists]].  The #NotAllMen [[Twitter]] hashtag was tweeted as early as 2011. The first viral tweet with this phrase, which was not yet a hashtag, was a satirical tweet by Shafiqah Hudson in February 2013: "ME: Men and boys are socially instructed to not listen to us. They are taught to interrupt us when we- RANDOM MAN: Excuse me. Not ALL men."&lt;ref name="vox.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=sassycrass|author=Shafiquah Hudson|number=304432121223716864|title=ME: Men and boys are socially instructed to not listen to us. They are taught to interrupt us when we- RANDOM MAN: Excuse me. Not ALL men.|date=20 February 2013|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotypical "Not-All-Man", barging into a conversation criticizing male behavior, was caricatured in a comic by artist Matt Lubchansky on April 14, 2014.&lt;ref name="Jess Zimmerman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vox.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matt|last=Lubchansky|title=Save Me|website = Please Listen to Me|url=http://www.listen-tome.com/save-me/|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lubchansky’s comic was quickly retweeted and otherwise shared by several male celebrities including [[Wil Wheaton]], [[Paul F. Tompkins]], [[Matt Fraction]], and [[John Scalzi]].&lt;ref name="Jess Zimmerman"/&gt;

==2014 Isla Vista killings==
{{see also|2014 Isla Vista killings|YesAllWomen}}

&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;NotAllMen was already a [[Twitter]] [[hashtag]] created by the Twitter user Sassycrass before the [[2014 Isla Vista killings]], but it gained additional traction after the event, because of the hatred against women expressed by the shooter, [[Elliot Rodger]]. In response to the hashtag #NotAllMen, an anonymous female Twitter user created the hashtag #YesAllWomen, to express that all women are affected by sexism and [[misogyny]], even though not all men are sexist. This newly created hashtag quickly became used by women throughout social media to share their experiences of sexual discrimination and attacks.&lt;ref&gt;For coverage of this topic, see the following sources:

==Bengaluru incident==

After reports of a mass molestation occurring at India’s Bengaluru New Year’s Eve celebration, #NotAllMen began trending on Twitter. This drew an angry reaction from women, with many Indian feminists and women strongly criticizing the hashtag while responding with their own hashtag #YesAllWomen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Arielle|last=De Bono|url= http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/news-and-views/yesallwomen-resurfaces-in-india-in-the-wake-of-mass-molestation-20170104-gtm76i.html?deviceType=text | title = #YesAllWomen resurfaces in India in the wake of mass molestation|website=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|location=Sydney, Australia| date= 8 January 2017|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Annanya|last=Bhattacharya|url= https://qz.com/876967/notallmen-is-not-an-appropriate-response-to-a-mob-molesting-scores-of-women-in-indias-silicon-valley/ | title = #NotAllMen is not an appropriate response to a mob molesting scores of women in India’s Silicon Valley| website=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz India]]|publisher=[[Atlantic Media]]|location=New York City|date= 8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Andre|last=Borges|url= https://www.buzzfeed.com/andreborges/women-are-hitting-back-at-the-not-all-men-response-to-the-ma | title = People Are Furious At The "Not All Men" Response To The Mass Molestation In Bengaluru On NYE | website=[[Buzzfeed]]|date= 8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

As Kelsey McKinney of [[Vox (website)|Vox]] states, "The phrase has been reappropriated by feminists and turned into a meme meant to parody its pervasiveness and bad faith."&lt;ref name="vox.com"/&gt; #NotAllMen-related memes include references to [[Aquaman]], ''[[Adventure Time]]'', ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'', and the [[Kool Aid Man]] crashing through a wall to exclaim "not all men".&lt;ref name="jezebel"&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Guide to 'Not All Men,' the Best Meme on the Internet|website= [[Jezebel.com]]|author=Erin Gloria Ryan |url=http://jezebel.com/your-guide-to-not-all-men-the-best-meme-on-the-interne-1573535818|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An explanation of the NotAllMen hashtag came from Hillary Di Menna of ''[[This (Canadian magazine)|This Magazine]]'', who claimed that: "Saying 'not all men' is not helpful. We need to listen and we need to reflect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Menna |first=Hillary Di |url=http://this.org/blog/2014/07/14/gender-block-slutwalk-toronto-2014/ |title=Gender Block: SlutWalk Toronto 2014 &amp;#124; This Magazine |publisher=This.org |date=2011-04-03 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slate Magazine]] writer Phil Plait wrote that the hashtag was {{Quote|not an unexpected response. However, it’s also not a helpful one. Why is it not helpful to say "not all men are like that"?  For lots of reasons. For one, women know this. They already know not every man is a rapist, or a murderer, or violent. They don’t need you to tell them. Second, it’s defensive. When people are defensive, they aren’t listening to the other person; they’re busy thinking of ways to defend themselves. I watched this happen on Twitter, over and again. Third, the people saying it aren’t furthering the conversation, they’re sidetracking it. The discussion isn’t about the men who aren’t a problem. (Though, I’ll note, it can be. I’ll get back to that.) Instead of being defensive and distracting from the topic at hand, try staying quiet for a while and actually listening to what the thousands upon thousands of women discussing this are saying. Fourth—and this is important, so listen carefully—when a woman is walking down the street, or on a blind date, or, yes, in an elevator alone, she doesn’t know which group you’re in. You might be the potential best guy ever in the history of history, but there’s no way for her to know that. A fraction of men out there are most definitely not in that group. Which are you? Inside your head you know, but outside your head it’s impossible to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plait |first=Phil |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/05/27/not_all_men_how_discussing_women_s_issues_gets_derailed.html |title=Not All Men: How Discussing Women’s Issues Gets Derailed; |publisher=Slate.com |date=2014-05-27 |accessdate=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}In a differing opinion, [[India Times]] writer Sumeet Keswani writes that the statement "does not serve to derail the feminism movement; it seeks to draw the line between feminism and [[misandry]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keswani|first1=Suweet|title=Why #NotAllMen is part of the feminist movement, not against it|url=http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sumeet-keswani-blog/why-notallmen-is-part-of-the-feminist-movement-not-against-it/|website=indiatimes.com|publisher=India Times|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6804">'''Professor Paul Ekins [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]''' (born 1950) is a   [[British people|British]] academic in the field of sustainable economics, currently co-director of the [[UK Energy Research Centre]]. He is a former member of the Green Party.

==Political career==
Ekins was a prominent member of the [[UK Green Party]] (now the [[Green Party of England and Wales]]) in the 1970s and 80s. He left in 1986 after controversy over reforms he and others were promoting to streamline Green Party structures. This group, known as 'Maingreen', was seen as a forerunner of the moves to reform the party’s internal structures by a later group known as [[Green 2000]].&lt;ref name=GPHistory&gt;Wall, Derek, ''Weaving a Bower Against Endless Night: An Illustrated History of the Green Party'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career after politics==
Ekins has been a prominent green academic in the field of sustainable economics. He has also worked as a consultant.&lt;ref name=UCLBiog/&gt;

In 1996, he set up [[Forum for the Future]] with [[Sara Parkin]] and [[Jonathon Porritt]].&lt;ref name=Forum1&gt;[http://www.forumforthefuture.org.uk/news/alistairmcgowan_page406.aspx Press Notice footnote from Forum for the Future] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928193420/http://www.forumforthefuture.org.uk/news/alistairmcgowan_page406.aspx |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forum says: “When Paul Ekins set up the Sustainable Economy Unit as part of Forum for the
Future back in 1996, he argued that ‘many of today’s environmental problems
are really economic problems in disguise, and getting the economics right lies
at the heart of any solutions agenda.’ He aimed ‘to show that radical moves
towards environmental sustainability are compatible with prosperity’.
This remains a central part of Forum’s mission.”&lt;ref name=ForumAnnReport06&gt;[http://www.forumforthefuture.org.uk/docs/publications/403/Annual%20Report%2006.pdf Forum for the Future Annual Report 2006, p6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928193428/http://www.forumforthefuture.org.uk/docs/publications/403/Annual%20Report%2006.pdf |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked as head of the Environment group at the [[Policy Studies Institute]].&lt;ref name=UCLBiog&gt;[https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/research/personal?upi=PEKIN72 University College London Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has worked as an advisor to the [[Environmental Audit Select Committee]] of the [[British House of Commons]].&lt;ref name=UCLBiog/&gt; In 1994, Ekins received a [[UN Environment Programme]] Global 500 Award ”for outstanding environmental achievement”.&lt;ref name=UCLBiog/&gt;

Ekins was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[2015 New Year Honours]] for services to environmental policy.

==Academic career==

Paul Ekins took a Ph.D. in economics at [[Birkbeck, University of London]]. He became Professor of Sustainable Development at the [[University of Westminster]], from October 2002 – 2007.&lt;ref name=UCLBiog/&gt; He is currently Professor of Resources and Environmental Policy at [[University College London]].

His academic work examines the "conditions and policies for achieving an environmentally sustainable economy".&lt;ref name=UCLBiog/&gt;

'''Peace Arch Park''' is an international park consisting of '''Peace Arch Historical State Park''' in the [[United States]] and '''Peace Arch Provincial Park''' in [[Canada]]. The park straddles the [[Canada–United States border|international boundary]] between the United States and Canada at the extreme western end of the main contiguous section of the two countries' land border, where it reaches [[Semiahmoo Bay]] of [[Puget Sound]] on the continent's [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific Coast]].&lt;ref name=detached/&gt; The park's central feature is the [[Peace Arch]].

The park is located at the [[Peace Arch Border Crossing]] (also known as the Douglas Border Crossing), where [[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]] in British Columbia and [[Interstate 5]] in Washington State meet. The park's northern portion is about {{convert|9| ha}} and is managed by the [[British Columbia]] Ministry of Environment.&lt;ref name=bcparks/&gt; The southern portion is about {{convert|20|acre}} and is managed by the [[Washington State Park System|Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission]].&lt;ref name=wasp/&gt;

==History==
The [[Peace Arch]], dedicated in 1921, commemorates the [[Treaty of Ghent]] and the [[Rush–Bagot Treaty|Rush-Bagot agreement]], which "provided for peaceful resolution of U.S.--British disputes and an unguarded U.S./Canadian border." The United States side was established as a state park in 1931.&lt;ref name=wasp/&gt; The Canadian side was established as a provincial park on November 7, 1939.&lt;ref name=bcparks/&gt;

==Recreation==
Recreational activities include walking and picnicking as well as a playground for children. Visitors are free to explore the entire park on both sides of the actual physical border, but are warned not cross the boundary of the park to enter the adjacent country without being cleared to enter by the respective [[customs]] authority, as violators are subject to prosecution.&lt;ref name=uscpaa/&gt; Although no known cameras are in the park itself, [[United States Border Patrol]] agents in cars, on bikes, and on foot inside and steerable cameras on poles outside watch the park.&lt;ref name="clui"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.clui.org/section/united-divide-a-linear-portrait-usacanada-border-5 |title=Chapter 6: Washington State |website=United Divide: A Linear Portrait of the USA/Canada Border |publisher=The Center for Land Use Interpretation |publication-date=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
The International Peace Arch Association (IPAA) (formerly the United States Canada Peace Anniversary Association) is a nonprofit association dedicated to the heritage and preservation of the international monument. The association hosts park events and activities including the annual International Sculpture Exhibition, which highlights the work of American and Canadian artists.&lt;ref name=uscpaa/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3562">The '''Peace Information Center''' (PIC) was an anti-war organization based in the United States which provided information on peace initiatives in other countries, and promoted the [[Stockholm appeal]].   The organization was in existence from April 3 to October 12, 1950.  Members included [[O. John Rogge]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[John T. McManus]], [[Paul Robeson]], [[C. B. Baldwin]], [[Albert E. Kahn]], [[Johannes Steel]],  [[Gene Weltfish]], [[Leon Strauss]], [[Elizabeth Moos]], [[Kyrle Elkin]], [[Abbot Simon]] and [[Shirley Graham]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, p 688.&lt;/ref&gt;

W. E. B. Du Bois, a staunch opponent of nuclear weapons, was chairman of the Peace Information Center. It worked to publicize the [[Stockholm Peace Appeal]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (2009), p 688&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary purpose of the appeal was to gather signatures on a petition, asking world governments to ban all nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (2009), p 689.&lt;/ref&gt; The PIC issued a publication called ''Peacegram'' that reported on international developments related to peace.&lt;ref name="Lieberman2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robbie Lieberman|title=The Strangest Dream Communism, Anticommunism, and the U.S. Peace Movement, 1945-1963 (PB)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzqXGAZ2hNoC&amp;pg=PA101|accessdate=29 February 2012|publication-date=2010|year=2000|publisher=Syracuse University Press (republished in 2010 by Information Age Publishing)|isbn=978-1-61735-054-2|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Justice Department]] alleged that the PIC was acting as an agent of the [[Soviet Union]], and thus required the PIC to register with the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Paul, "Peace Movement",  in ''W. E. B. Du Bois: An Encyclopedia'', Gerald Horne and Mary Young (Eds.), Greenwood, p 163.&lt;/ref&gt;   Du Bois and other PIC leaders refused, and they were indicted for failure to register.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (2009), p 690.&lt;/ref&gt;    Some of Du Bois's associates distanced themselves from him&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (2009), p 692.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[NAACP]] refused to issue a statement of support,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (2009), p 693.&lt;/ref&gt; but many leftists and labor figures, including [[Langston Hughes]], supported Du Bois.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (2009), pp 693&amp;ndash;694.&lt;/ref&gt;  In late 1952, with defense attorney [[Vito Marcantonio]] arguing the case,  the case was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (2009), p 690.&lt;br/&gt;Du Bois's memoir of the trial is ''In Battle for Peace''.&lt;/ref&gt;    The federal government confiscated Du Bois's passport during the PIC trial, and even though he was not convicted, they withheld it for eight years, because Du Bois had refused to sign a non-Communist affidavit.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (2009), pp 696, 707.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1951, following the dissolution of the PIC, DuBois and others established the [[American Peace Crusade]].&lt;ref name="Lieberman2010"/&gt;

[[Image:Palazzo del Podestà old.jpg|thumb|235px|The Palace of the Podestà in [[Florence]], now the [[Bargello]] museum]]
'''Podestà''' ({{IPA-it|podeˈsta|pron}}) is the name given to certain high officials in many [[Italy|Italian]] cities beginning in the later [[Middle Ages]]. Mainly it meant the [[chief magistrate]] of a city state, the counterpart to similar positions in other cities that went by other names, e.g. ''rettori'' ("rectors"), but it could also mean the local administrator, who was the representative of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. Currently, ''Podestà'' is the title of [[mayor]]s in [[Italian language|Italian]]-speaking municipalities of [[Graubünden]] in [[Switzerland]].

==Etymology==
The term derives from the [[Latin]] word ''[[potestas]]'', meaning power. There is a similar derivation for the Arabic term ''[[Sultan]]'': originally meaning "power" or "authority", it eventually became the title of the person holding power.&lt;ref&gt;There is an uncharacteristically early use of ''potestas'' in this sense, in [[Juvenal]], ''Satire'' X, 99-101, an image of a magistrate in a little town, judging of weights and measures.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italian history==
The first documented usage of ''podestà'' was in [[Bologna]] in 1151, when it was applied to Guido di Ranieri di Sasso of Canossa, brought in from Faenza to be ''rettore e podestà'', noted in numerous documents.&lt;ref&gt;Savioli, ''Annali Bolognesi'' I, 225-31, noted by Born 1927:864 note 80.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leander Albertus]] gives the particulars:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The citizens, seeing that there often arose among them quarrels and altercations, whether from favoritism or friendship, from envy or hatred that one had against another, by which their republic suffered great harm, loss and detriment; therefore, they decided, after much deliberation, to provide against these disorders. And thus they began to create a man of foreign birth their chief magistrate, giving him every power, authority and jurisdiction over the city, as well over criminal as over civil causes, and in times of war as well as in times of peace, calling him [[praetor]] as being above the others, or ''podestà''., as having every authority and power over the city."&lt;ref&gt;Edith E.C. James, ''Bologna, Its History, Antiquities, and Art'' (London) 1909: 99f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Lodewijk Toeput - Portrait of a Podestà.jpg|thumb|left|''Portrait of a Podestà'' by [[Lodewijk Toeput]]]]
Podestà were first more widely appointed by the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick Barbarossa]] when he began to assert the rights that his Imperial position gave him over the cities of northern Italy; at the [[Diet of Roncaglia|second imperial diet at Roncaglia]], November 1158, Frederick appointed in several major cities imperial podestà "as if having imperial power in that place"&lt;ref&gt;''quasi habens potestatem imperialis in hac parte''.&lt;/ref&gt; The elected consuls, which Frederick had claimed the right to ratify, he began to designate directly. The business of the podestà was to enforce imperial rights. From the start, this was very unpopular, and their often arbitrary behaviour was a factor in bringing about the formation of the [[Lombard League]] and the uprising against Frederick in 1167.

Although the Emperor's experiment was short-lived, the podestà soon became important and common in northern Italy, making their appearance in most communes around the year 1200, with an essential difference. These officials were now appointed by the citizens or by the citizens' representatives, rather like the older [[consul]]s (but not collegial). The podestà exercised the supreme power in the city, both in peace and war, and in foreign and domestic matters alike; but their term of office lasted only about a year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|Du Cange]], ''Glossarium mediæ et infimæ Latinitatis'', vol 6, gives this sense and explores many ramifications of ''potestas'' in [[Late Latin]] and [[feudal]] usage.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to avoid the intense strife so common in Italian civic life, it soon became the custom to hire a stranger to fill this position. [[Venice|Venetians]] were in special demand for this purpose during the 12th and 13th centuries. This was probably due to their lesser concern (at the time) than other Italians in the affairs of the mainland. Afterwards, in a few cases, the term of office was extended to cover a period of years, or even a lifetime. They were confined in a luxury palace to keep them from being influenced by any of the local families. The architectural arrangement of the [[Palazzo Pubblico]] at [[Siena]], built starting in 1297, evokes the uneasy relation of the commune with the ''podestà'', who in Siena's case was a disinterested nobleman at the head of the judiciary. It provided a self-contained lodging round its own interior court for the podestà, separate but housed within the Palazzo Pubblico where the councillors and their committee of nine habitually met.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

During the later part of the twelfth and the whole of the thirteenth century most Italian cities were governed by a podestà. Concerning [[Rome]], with a history of civic violence, [[Ferdinand Gregorovius|Gregorovius]] says that "in 1205 the [[pope Innocent III]] changed the form of the civic government; the executive power lying henceforward in the hand of a single senator or podest, who, directly or indirectly, was appointed by the pope".{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In [[Florence]] after 1180, the chief authority was transferred from the [[consul]]s to the podest, and [[Milan]] and other cities were also ruled by these officials. There were, moreover, podests in some of the cities of [[Provence]] (southeastern France, the former province [[Gallia Narbonensis]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

An anonymous writer composed a short guide for the would-be ''podestà'' (although it would be unseemly to appear openly to run for the office), ''Oculus pastoralis'', of about 1222;&lt;ref&gt;In full ''Oculus pastoralis, sive libellus erudiens futurum rectorem populorum'', "The Pastoral eye, or little book informing the future rector of the people"; the text wasf first printed Muratori, ''Antiquitates Italicæ Medi Ævi'' iv 96-128, and recently Oculus pastoralis. Pascens officia et continens radium dulcibus pomis suis, bearb. v. Dora Franceschi, Turin 1966 (Memorie dell'Accademia delle scienze di Torino. Serie 4 11).&lt;/ref&gt; in six simple and brief chapters it guides the novice through the requirements of the office, the salary, the address of welcome given by the retiring ''podestà'' to the new one, the choice of counsellors, the handling of money accounts. The fifth chapter offers some model speeches on public occasions, such as the death of prominent citizens. A final chapter touches upon making war (in a paragraph), and the training of urban officials.

In the thirteenth century in Florence, in [[Orvieto]] (1251) and some other cities a ''capitano del popolo'' (literally, "captain of the people") was chosen to look after the interests of the lower classes. (To this day, the heads of government of the little independent republic of [[San Marino]] are still called "capitani".) In other ways the power of the podests was reduced&amp;mdash;they were confined more and more to [[judicial]] functions until they disappeared early in the sixteenth century.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The officials sent by the Italian republics to administer the affairs of dependent cities were also sometimes called podests. Into the 20th century the cities of [[Trento]] and [[Trieste]] gave the name of podest to their [[chief magistrate]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The example of Italy in the matter of podests was sometimes followed by cities and republics in [[northern Europe]] in the Middle Ages, notably by such as had trade relations with Italy. The officers elected sometimes bore the title of ''podesta'' or ''podestat''. Thus in [[East Frisia]] there were podests identical in name and functions with those of the Italian republics; sometimes each province had one, sometimes the federal diet elected a podest-general for the whole country, the term of office being for a limited period or for life.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Motley, ''Dutch Republic'', ed. 1903, vol. i. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fascist era===
The [[Italian Fascism|Fascist regime]] created its own version of the ''podestà'' figure. In February 1926, [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's Senate]] issued a decree which abolished the autonomous powers and functions of ''[[comune]]s'' (municipalities), including elected town councils and [[mayor]]s. Instead, all ''comunes'' except for [[Rome]] were to be headed by a  "''podestà''", an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] mayor with full executive and legislative powers. He was appointed by [[royal charter]] (in practice, by the [[National Fascist Party]]) for a renewable five-year term (which could be revoked at any time with immediate effect). In Rome, a [[List of mayors of Rome#Fascist Governors|governor]] was appointed to head the local government. In larger communes, the ''podestà'' was assisted by one or two ''vice-podestà'' nominated by the [[Ministry of Interior (Italy)|Ministry of Interior]], in addition to a board of advisors (''consulta municipale'')&lt;ref name=Born1927&gt;{{cite journal|last=Born|first=Lester K|title=What is the Podestà?|journal=[[The American Political Science Review]]|date=November 1927|volume=21|issue=4|pages=869–870|jstor=1947600}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; nominated either by the local [[Prefect#Modern sub-national administration|prefect]] or, in the major cities, by the Ministry of Interior.

The decree was in effect from 21 April 1927 until 1945,&lt;ref name=Born1927/&gt; when the entire system was abandoned with the return to democracy.

==Podesteria==
Literally this derived word means the office of a podestà or its term, but ''Podesteria'' can also designate a district administered by a ''podestà'' within a larger state.
 
In the ''[[domini di Terraferma]]'' that the dogal [[republic of Venice]] gradually established in the basin of the river Po, annexing various former principalities and self-governing cities, mostly in the fifteenth century, podesterias (ven. ''podestarie'') were one of the intermediate levels of the hierarchical administrative organization, the highest ('provincial') level being the ''territorio'' (roughly a modern administrative region).

After the other dogal republic, [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], was in 1273 granted control of [[Beyoğlu|Pera]] and [[Galata]], commercial suburbs of [[Constantinople]], by the Byzantine emperor, it governed them jointly by a common ''podestà'' until 1453, when all Constantinople was conquered by the [[Ottoman Turks]].

==Frisian ''potestaat''==
The concept of a local man ''empowered'' to represent the Emperor was also a feature of medieval [[Frisia]]. From apocryphal beginnings, important rights were granted or confirmed under the code of law known as the ''[[Lex Frisionum]]''. According to later tradition, it was [[Charlemagne]] who granted the Frisians the title of freemen and permitted them to choose their own podestat or imperial governor from among the chieftains, to organize and lead the defense of two of the three districts of Frisia, in [[Middle Frisia]], from the [[Flie]] to the [[Lauwers]] and in [[East Frisia]] from the Lauwers to the [[Weser]], later the Countship of [[Ostfriesland]].

The Frisians probably became aware of the Italian title of ''podestà'' (Dutch: ''potestaat'', German: ''Potestat'', English: ''potestate'') during the [[Sixth Crusade]] in 1228. According to privileges that were falsely ascribed to the [[Carolingian]] era, the ''potestate'' was chosen by council and he must be able to slay knights. Apocryphal historical writings mention the potestate as early as the [[Viking age]].

The only ''potestates'' chosen to lead [[Friesland]] between the [[Vlie]] and [[Lauwers]] were [[Juw Juwinga]] (1396) and [[Juw Dekema]] (1494), both were chosen by the [[Schieringers]]. However, in 1399 the districts of [[Westergo]] and [[Oostergo]] elected potestates, [[Haring Harinxma]] and [[Sjoerd Wiarda]] respectively, in the struggle against the count of Holland. The title became well known outside of Friesland only with the installation of [[Albrecht of Saxony]] as ''hereditary potestate'' in 1498; the Frisians chose [[Jancko Douwama]] as their imperial [[stadtholder]] (1522).

'''''Pray the Devil Back to Hell''''' is a [[documentary film]] directed by Gini Reticker and produced by [[Abigail Disney]]. The film premiered at the 2008 [[Tribeca Film Festival]], where it won the award for Best Documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribecafilm.com/home/18455719.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303043905/http://www.tribecafilm.com/home/18455719.html |archivedate=2009-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had its theatrical release in New York City on November 7, 2008.

The film documents a [[peace movement]] called [[Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace]]. Organized by social worker [[Leymah Gbowee]], the movement started with praying and singing in a fish market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odemagazine.com/blogs/readers_blog/9001/leymah_gbowee_peace_warrior_for_liberia 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227090728/http://www.odemagazine.com/blogs/readers_blog/9001/leymah_gbowee_peace_warrior_for_liberia |date=2009-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leymah Gbowee organized the [[Christian]] and [[Muslim]] women of [[Monrovia]], [[Liberia]] to pray for peace and to organize [[nonviolent]] protests. Dressed in white to symbolize peace, and numbering in the thousands, the women became a political force against violence and against their government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guideposts.com/blog/life-faith-liberia-peace-movement-women|title=Blogs|work=Guideposts|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their movement led to the election of [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] in Liberia, the first [[Africa]]n nation with a [[female president]]. The film has been used as an [[advocacy]] tool in post-conflict zones like [[Sudan]], mobilizing African women to petition for peace and security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaglobal.org/article/2009-11-01/pray-the-devil-back-to-hell-documentary-serves-as-advocacy-tool-in-post-conflict-zones/ November 2009 MEDIAGLOBAL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710093803/http://www.mediaglobal.org/article/2009-11-01/pray-the-devil-back-to-hell-documentary-serves-as-advocacy-tool-in-post-conflict-zones/ |date=2010-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
A group of ordinary women in [[Liberia]], led by Leymah Gbowee, came together to pray for peace. Armed only with white T-shirts and the courage of their convictions, they demanded a resolution to the country’s civil war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awdfchicago.org/about-film.html African Women Development Fund] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922002001/http://www.awdfchicago.org/about-film.html |date=2009-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Leymah Gbowee's leadership, the women managed to force a meeting with President [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] and extract a promise from him to attend peace talks in [[Ghana]]. Gbowee then led a delegation of Liberian women to Ghana to continue to apply pressure on the warring factions during the peace process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/events/2008/11/inf/GboweeLeymah.html Center for American Progress]&lt;/ref&gt; They staged a silent protest outside of the [[Golden Jubilee House|Presidential Palace, Accra]], bringing about an agreement during the stalled peace talks.

Asatu Bah Kenneth is featured in the film. She is currently Assistant Minister for Administration and Public Safety of the Liberian Ministry of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unmil.org/1article.asp?id=3718&amp;zdoc=1|title=UNMIL – Misión de las Naciones Unidas en Liberia|website=unmil.org|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, she was the president of the Liberia Female Law Enforcement Association. Inspired by the work of the Christian women's peace initiative, she formed the Liberian Muslim Women's Organization to work for peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unmultimedia.org/radio/english/detail/64653.html United Nations Radio]&lt;/ref&gt;

Working together, over 3,000 [[Christian]] and [[Muslim]] women mobilized their efforts, and as a result, the women were able to achieve peace in Liberia after a 14-year civil war and helped bring to power the country's first female head of state.

== Title ==
The title of the film is drawn from Gbowee’s statement about Taylor and the rebels. Both sides were supposedly religious. The rebels frequented mosques, while Taylor claimed to be a devout Christian who, according to Gbowee, could “pray the devil out of Hell.” It was therefore the responsibility of the women in this inter-faith coalition to pray the devil (of war) right back to Hell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://234next.com/csp/cms/sites/Next/ArtsandCulture/Film/5547883-147/story.csp Praying the Liberian war back to hell ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402203842/http://234next.com/csp/cms/sites/Next/ArtsandCulture/Film/5547883-147/story.csp |date=2010-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spanish Agrarian Party''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Partido Agrario Español'') was a [[political party]] in [[Spain]] during the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]]. Initially the party was known as '''Agrarian Party''' (''Partido Agrario'') but took the name PAE in 1934.

PAE was a republican party, and it cooperated with centrist and rightwing parties. PAE took part in right-wing governments.

PAE had its base amongst small and medium farmers, and the party clearly opposed [[agrarian reform]]. The main base of the party was in [[Castilla y León]].

The Youth of PAE published ''Vibración'' in [[Catalonia]].

In the 1970s the party was refounded. On October 4, 1976 it was one of the five first political parties to register. In the [[Spanish general election, 1977]], it won 833 votes out of 18,324,333.

'''''To the Unknown British Soldier in France''''' is an [[oil-on-canvas]] painting by Irish artist [[Sir William Orpen]], exhibited in one state in 1923 and then modified in 1927.  It was one of three paintings commissioned from Orpen to commemorate the [[Versailles Peace Conference|Peace Conference]] at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] in 1919.  The work is held by the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London.&lt;ref name=IWMUnknown&gt;{{cite web |author=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/20880|title=''To the Unknown British Soldier in France''|year=|accessdate=9 February 2015|work=[[Imperial War Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WW1Art"&gt;{{cite book|author=|publisher=Imperial War Museum|year=2008|title=Art from the First World War|ISBN=978-1-904897-98-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Orpen was one of the first people chosen as a [[war artist]] by the British [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] in 1917.  Orpen was also official painter at the Versailles peace conference, and was commissioned to paint three canvases to record the roles of the politicians, diplomats and military at the conference, for a fee of £6,000.  The other two works, ''[[A Peace Conference at the Quai d'Orsay]]'' and ''[[The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors, Versailles, 28th June 1919]]'', are both group portraits depicting the participants at the conference.  

Orpen was deeply affected by the suffering he witnessed in France during the war, and grew to dislike the politicians at the conference.  ''To the Unknown British Soldier in France'' was originally intended to include a group of soldiers and statesmen in the Hall of Peace at the [[Palace of Versailles]], including Admirals [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Beatty]] and [[Frederick Sturdee|Sturdee]]; Field Marshals [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby]], [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|French]], [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Haig]] and [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|Plumer]]; Generals [[John Cowans|Cowans]], [[Arthur Currie|Currie]] and [[Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson|Rawlinson]]; Lieutenant [[Arthur Rhys-Davids]]; [[David Lloyd George]]; [[Georges Clemenceau]], and Marshals [[Philippe Pétain|Pétain]] and [[Ferdinand Foch|Foch]]. Orpen had completed perhaps 30 portraits before he changed his mind and painted out the faces.  Over time, the faces have now become faintly visible again under the surface of the modified work.

==Subject==
The painting measures {{convert|154.2|xx|128.9|cm|in}}.  It shows a coffin holding the remains of an [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|unknown soldier]], [[lying in state]] in a marble hall, covered by a [[Union Flag]] and topped by a [[Brodie helmet|British helmet]], with a chandelier hanging above. A dark hallway opens up through an arched opening behind the coffin, and light is visible falling from another arched opening in the distance, with the faint outline of a cross.  The coffin is located in the Hall of Peace at the Palace of Versailles, with the Hall of Mirrors behind leading to the Hall of War.&lt;ref name=tes&gt;{{cite web |author=Helena Stride|url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=2090817  |title=War &amp; Peace|date=12 May 2008|accessdate=9 February 2015|work=TES Connect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In place of the group portrait, in the original version of the revised painting, Orpen decided to accompany the coffin with an honour guard of two emaciated soldiers, bearing guns but clad only in loin-cloths of tattered blankets.  Above, two cherubs held a floral garland that reached down to the floor.&lt;ref name=Art&gt;{{cite web |author=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.memorial-caen.fr/10EVENT/EXPO1418/gb/texte/097text.html|title=Art of the First World War:-''To the Unknown British Soldier in France''|year=|accessdate=9 February 2015|work=[[Imperial War Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The completed work was first exhibited at the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] in 1923.  It was one of the more popular exhibits with the public, but it was attacked as in poor taste by critics.  The Imperial War Museum declined to take the work on the grounds that it did not meet the terms of the commission.

Orpen later painted out the soldiers and the cherubs with their flowers, and then donated the revised painting to the Imperial War Museum in 1928 as a tribute to the late Field Marshal Haig.

{{Criticism of Islam}}

The [[Quran]], the holy book of Islam, contains verses believed by [[Muslims]] to be revealed to the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] at different times and under different circumstances – some exhorting [[violence]] against enemies and others urging restraint and conciliation. Because some verses [[Naskh (tafsir)|abrogate]] others, and because some are thought to be general commands while other refer to specific enemies, how the verses are understood and how they relate to each other "has been a central issue in Islamic thinking on war" according to scholars such as Charles Matthews.&lt;ref name=Mathewes/&gt;

While numerous scholars explain  [[Quran]]ic phrases on violence to be only in the context of a defensive response to oppression;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Durie|first1=Mark|title=Violence and Context in Islamic Texts|url=https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/3771/violence-islamic-texts|website=GatestoneInstitute.com|publisher=Gatestone Institute – International Policy Council|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Who Are the Moderate Muslims"&gt;Sam Harris [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-harris/who-are-the-moderate-musl_b_15841.html Who Are the Moderate Muslims?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abdala|first1=Mohamad|title=Critical opinion of Islam ignores the fundamental truths|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/critical-opinion-of-islam-ignores-the-fundamental-truths-20130527-2n7gg.html|website=smh.com.au|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boundaries_Princeton"&gt;Sohail H.

==Abrogation==
{{main|Naskh (tafsir)}}

Charles Matthews writes that there is a "large debate about what the Quran commands as regards the "sword verses" and the "peace verses".  According to Matthews, "the question of the proper prioritization of these verses, and how they should be understood in relation to one another, has been a central issue for Islamic thinking about war."&lt;ref name=Mathewes&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Religious Ethics |first=Charles T. |last=Mathewes|publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2010 |page=197 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EyCsZE_iHp4C&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=Koran+%22sword+verses%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] travel, [[Muhammad]] struggled non-violently against his oppressors in [[Mecca]].&lt;ref name="cultures"&gt;Boulding, Elise. "Cultures of Peace: The Hidden Side of History", p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until after the exile that the [[Quran|Quranic revelations]] began to adopt a more offensive perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Lawrence. "Terrorism: Roots, Impact, Responses", p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Oliver Leaman, a number of Islamic jurists asserted the primacy of the "sword verses" over the conciliatory verses in specific historical circumstances.&lt;ref name=Leaman /&gt;  For example, according to Diane Morgan, [[Ibn Kathir]] (1301–1372) asserted that the [[Sword Verse]] [[Naskh (tafsir)|abrogated]] all peace treaties that had been promulgated between Muhammad and idolaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Essential Islam: a comprehensive guide to belief and practice |first=Diane |last=Morgan|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2010 |page=89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U94S6N2zECAC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=sword+verses+quran#v=onepage&amp;q=sword%20verses%20quran&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic Modernism|Modernists]] reject the abrogating status of the sword verses, which would result in the abrogation (naskh) of numerous Quranic verses that counsel peace and reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Shariʻa as discourse: legal traditions and the encounter with Europe |first1=Jørgen S.|last1=Nielsen |first2=Lisbet |last2=Christoffersen |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year=2010 |page=39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0VJ_t0F7ZGEC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Quran+%22sword+verses%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20%22sword%20verses%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Muslims and modernity: an introduction to the issues and debates |first=Clinton |last=Bennett |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2005|page=220 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D0vYYovH7OQC&amp;dq=Koran+%22sword+verses%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peace and conciliation==
Numerous scholars and authors, both Muslim and non-Muslim have testified to the underlying rejection of violence, cruelty, coercion, and intolerance of the Quran and its embrace of justice and self-defence. 
According to Fawzy Abdelmalek, "many Muslim scholars speak of Islam as a [[Religion of Peace|religion of peace]] and not of violence. They say that the non-Muslims misunderstand the Quran verses about Jihad and the conduct of war in Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Turning Point: Islam &amp; Jesus Salvation|first=Fawzy T. |last=Abdelmalek |publisher=AuthorHouse |year=2008 |page=210 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=REW7sYxFyBYC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq=Quran+violence#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20violence&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nissim Rejwan asserts that "violence and cruelty are not in the spirit of the Quran, nor are they found in the life of the Prophet, nor in the lives of saintly Muslims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The many faces of Islam: Perspectives on a resurgent civilization |first=Nissim |last=Rejwan|publisher=HarperCollins |year=2004 |page=151 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hjyM4r5IJhMC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=Quran+violence#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20violence&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Feisal Abdul Rauf, "the Quran expressly and unambiguously prohibits the use of coercion in faith because coercion would violate a fundamental human right&amp;mdash; the right to a free conscience.  A different belief system is not deemed a legitimate cause for violence or war under Islamic law. The Quran is categorical on this: "There shall be no compulsion in religion" (2:256); "Say to the disbelievers [that is, atheists, or polytheists, namely those who reject God] "To you, your beliefs, to me, mine" (109:1–6)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=What's right with Islam: a new vision for Muslims and the West |first=Feisal Abdul |last=Rauf |page=129 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RgFQ06W5UrkC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=Quran+violence#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20violence&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Matthews characterizes the peace verses as saying that, "if others want peace, you can accept them as peaceful even if they are not Muslim."  As an example, Matthews cites the second sura which commands believers not to transgress limits in warfare: "fight in God's cause against those who fight you, but do not transgress limits [in aggression]; God does not love transgressors" (2:190).&lt;ref name=Mathewes /&gt;

Chiba and Schoenbaum argue that Islam "does not allow Muslims to fight against those who disagree with them regardless of belief system", but instead "urges its followers to treat such people kindly".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/004.qmt.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204153931/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/004.qmt.html#004.0904:90 |archive-date=4 December 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/008.qmt.html#008.0618:61]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/060.qmt.html#060.008 60:8]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Schoenbaum, Thomas J. |author2=Chiba, Shin |title=Peace Movements and Pacifism After September 11 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |location= |year=2008|pages=115–16|isbn=1-84720-667-0 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yohanan Friedmann has argued that the Quran does not promote fighting for the purposes of religious coercion, although the war as described is "religious" in the sense that the enemies of the Muslims are described as "enemies of God" ([http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/008.qmt.html#008.057 8:57–62]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedmann, Yohanan |title=Tolerance and coercion in Islam: interfaith relations in the Muslim tradition|publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2003 |pages=94–95 |isbn=0-521-82703-5 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomon A. Nigosian has argued that in "duty to halt aggression or to strive for the preservation of Islamic principles", fighting may be involved, where the Quran encourages them to "fight courageously and steadfastly against recalcitrant states, be they Muslim or non-Muslim." He also argues that the "Quranic statement is clear" on the issue of fighting in defence of Islam as "a duty that is to be carried out at all costs", where "God grants security to those Muslims who fight in order to halt or repel aggression".&lt;ref name="Nigosian2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nigosian|first=Solomon A.|title=Islam: Its History, Teaching, and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=my7hnALd_NkC|date=29 January 2004|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-11074-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2015}}

According to Chandra Muzaffar, "The Quranic exposition on resisting aggression, oppression and injustice lays down the parameters within which fighting or the use of violence is legitimate. What this means is that one can use the Quran as the criterion for when violence is legitimate and when it is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rights, religion and reform: enhancing human dignity through spiritual and moral transformation |first=Chandra|last=Muzaffar|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2002 |page=345 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQA02NT6tmAC&amp;pg=PA345&amp;dq=Quran+violence#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20violence&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Islamic telling of [[Cain and Abel in Islam|Cain and Abel]], Abel tells his murderous brother that "''If thou dost stretch thy hand against me to slay me, it is not for me to stretch my hand against thee to slay thee: for I do fear Allah''".&lt;ref&gt;Al-Ma'ida {{cite quran|5|28|style=nosup|expand=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, such as [[Jawdat Said]],&lt;ref&gt;Said, Jawdat. "The Doctrine of the First Son of Adam", 1964&lt;/ref&gt; have identified this as an example of pacifism.&lt;ref&gt;McGaffey, Rahula.

Various [[Ahmadi]]s scholars like [[Muhammad Ali (writer)|Muhammad Ali]], [[Maulana Sadr-ud-Din]], [[Basharat Ahmad]] and also the British [[oriental studies|orientalist]] [[Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner]] argue that when the Quran's verses are read in context, it clearly appears that the Quran prohibits initial aggression, and allows fighting only in self-defense.&lt;ref name="Ali, Maulana Muhammad - p. 414"&gt;Ali, Maulana Muhammad; The Religion of Islam (6th Edition), Ch V "Jihad" p. 414 "When shall war cease".

Arvind Kumar writes:

{{quote|The Quran sanctions violence to counter violence. If one studies the history of Arab tribes before Islam and fierce fighting they indulged in one would be convinced that the philosophy of passive resistance would not have worked in that environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedia of Human Rights, Violence and Non-violence: Non-violence and societal control |first=Arvind |last=Kumar |publisher=Anmol Publications PVT. LTD. |year=1998 |page=187 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAtWUgpPB2YC&amp;pg=PA187}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to [[Khaled Abou El Fadl]], "there is not a single verse in the Quran that calls for an unmitigated, unqualified, or unreserved obligation to fight the unbelievers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Theft: Wrestling Islam from the Extremists |first=Khaled M. Abou |last=El Fadl |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2007 |page=240 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fIrLjWF98FIC&amp;pg=PA240}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Esposito and Mogahed, the Quran balances permission to fight the enemy with a strong mandate for making peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|8|61|s=r|quote=If your enemy inclines toward peace, then you too should seek peace and put your trust in God}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Who speaks for Islam?: what a billion Muslims really think |first1=John L. |last1=Esposito |first2=Dalia |last2=Mogahed |publisher=Gallup Press |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sword verses==

According to Dipak kutha, "much of the religious justification of violence against nonbelievers (Dar ul [[Kufr]]) by the promoters of jihad is based on the Quranic "sword verses"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=

The Quran contains passages that could be interpreted to endorse violence,&lt;ref name=globalpolitician&gt;{{cite web|last=Roy|first=Saberi|title=Islam, Islamic Fundamentalism and Islamic Terrorism|url=http://www.globalpolitician.com/print.asp?id=3084|publisher=Globalpolitician|accessdate=17 March 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015005435/http://www.globalpolitician.com/print.asp?id=3084|archivedate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
some include {{cite quran|2|191|s=r}} and 193, {{cite quran|9|5|s=r}}, and {{cite quran|49|9|s=r}}.

{{quote|And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter... and fight them until fitnah is no more, and religion is for Allah. |{{cite quran|2|191|s=r}}}}

Quran scholars claim that the textual context of this particular passage is defensive war after the [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah]] was broken by the Qurayshi-affiliated Banu Bakr tribe when they attacked the Muslim-allied tribe of Banu Khaza'a. In response, the Prophet sent a letter requesting the Quraysh to either terminate their alliance with Banu Khaza'a or pay a ransom. The Quraysh rejected both of Mohammad's offers, thus, breaking the treaty. It is also agreed upon that the verse refers to only the ones who broke the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Hudaibiyah: A turning point in the history Islam|url=http://www.arabnews.com/hudaibiyah-turning-point-history-islam|author=Abu Tariq Hijazi|accessdate= 3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous verse says: 

{{quote|Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for Allah loveth not transgressors.|{{cite quran|2|190|s=r}}}} 

This has been used to argue that fighting is only permissible as a form of defence.&lt;ref&gt;http://alpha.quran.com/2/190-192?startPlay=undefined&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two points made in verse 2:191 that may cause some debate. The first is that the killing of others is authorized in the event of "persecution;" &lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Muhsin Khan]] translates,

{{quote|And fight in the Way of Allah those who fight you, but transgress not the limits. Truly, Allah likes not the transgressors. [''This Verse is the first one that was revealed in connection with Jihad, but it was supplemented by another (V.9:36)''].

And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out. And Al-Fitnah is worse than killing. And fight not with them at Al-Masjid-al-Haram (the sanctuary at Makkah), unless they (first) fight you there. But if they attack you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.

Fight them until there is no [more] fitnah and [until] worship is [acknowledged to be] for Allah. But if they cease, then there is to be no aggression except against the oppressors.

[[Micheline R. Ishay]] has argued that "the Quran justifies wars for self-defense to protect Islamic communities against internal or external aggression by non-Islamic populations, and wars waged against those who 'violate their oaths' by breaking a treaty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|9|12|end=15|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|42|39|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ishay, Micheline|title=The history of human rights |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley |year=|page=45 |isbn=0-520-25641-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mufti]] [[Mukarram Ahmad|M.

{{further|At-Tawba 5}}
{{religious text primary|section|date=March 2017}}
Antonie Wessels identifies two verses in the Quran (9:5 and 9:29) that are called "sword verses" though he notes that the word 'sword' does not occur in the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Muslims in the West: can they be integrated |first=Antonie |last=Wessels |publisher=Peeters Publishers |year=2006 |page=99 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=De3ap-Bz5eIC&amp;pg=PA99}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular,  [[At-Tawba 5|verse 9:5]] from [[Sura]]h [[At-Tawba]] is known as the ''Ayat al-sayf'', ''Ayah of the Sword'' or ''The Sword Verse''.

{{Quote Quran translation|9|5|But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.|translator=[[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]]}}

According to Yusuf Ali, in order to understand the context, we need to read from verse 1 of this surah. It says that there was a peace treaty between the Muslims and the Mushriks (pagans) of Makkah. This treaty was violated by the Mushriks of Makkah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|9|1|s=r|quote=A (declaration) of immunity from Allah and His Messenger, to those of the Pagans with whom ye have contracted mutual alliances.|t=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; A period of four months was given to the Pagans of Makkah to make amends. Otherwise, a war would be declared against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|9|2|quote=Go ye, then, for four months, backwards and forwards, (as ye will), throughout the land, but know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah (by your falsehood) but that Allah will cover with shame those who reject Him.|t=y|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an not only says that a Pagan seeking asylum during the battle should be granted refuge, but also that he should be escorted to a secure place so that he may be enticed to join the fold of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|9|6|quote=If one amongst the Pagans ask thee for asylum, grant it to him, so that he may hear the word of Allah; and then escort him to where he can be secure.

Reuven Firestone says that Ibn Kathir held that four of the "sword verses" refer specifically to "four types of people against whom the Muslims are obligated to fight: 9:5 refers to fighting the idolaters; 9:29 refers to fighting the Scriptuaries until they pay the poll tax; 9:73 refers to fighting those who outwardly appear as Muslims but who actually oppose Muhammad and the community of Islam, and 49:9 refers to fighting Muslims who unjustly oppress other Muslims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jihād: the origin of holy war in Islam |first=Reuven |last=Firestone |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=1999 |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A6kVVeIkzDkC&amp;pg=PA63}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arun Shourie]] has criticized the sword verse and many others from the Qur'an. He says that the [[sunnah]] and the [[hadith]] are equally evocative in their support of [[Jihad]], which he deems to be the ''[[leitmotiv]]'' of the Qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;Shourie, Arun. ''Indian Controversies, Essays in Religion and Politics'' ASA Publications, New Delhi-110021&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patricia Crone]] states that the famous Verse of the Sword is directed against a particular group accused of oath-breaking and aggression, and exempts those polytheists who remained faithful. Crone states that this verse seems to be based on the rules mentioned above. Here also it is stressed that one must stop when they do.&lt;ref name="Crone"&gt;Patricia Crone, Encyclopedia of the Quran, War article, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt;

Explaining the context of this verse, Quranic Scholars (such as [[Muhammad Asad]] and [[Maulana Muhammad Ali]]) state that the permission to fight and kill is being given regarding specific tribes already at war with the Muslims who have breached their peace agreements and have attacked the Muslims first.&lt;ref name="Ali, Maulana Muhammad - p. 414" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asad, Muhammad: The Message of The Quran.

==Warfare==

{{Main|War in Islam}}
{{See also|Jihad|Jihad in Hadith|Offensive jihad|Defensive jihad|Opinion of Islamic scholars on Jihad|Jihadism|Salafi jihadism|Itmam al-hujjah|Ghazw}}
The Quran asserts that if the use of force would not have been allowed in curbing the evils by nations, the disruption and disorder caused by insurgent nations could have reached the extent that the places of worship would have become deserted and forsaken. As it states:

{{quote|…And were it not that Allah checks the people, some by means of others, there would have been demolished monasteries, churches, [[synagogue]]s, and [[mosques]] in which the name of Allah is much mentioned. And Allah will surely support those who support Him…|Quran 22:40|}}

[[Javed Ahmed Ghamidi]] divides just warfare into two types:
# Against injustice and oppression
# Against the rejecters of truth after it has become evident to them

The first type of Jihad is generally considered eternal, but Ghamidi holds that the second is specific to people who were selected by God for delivering the truth as an obligation. They are called witnesses of the truth (Arabic:'''{{lang|ar|شهادة}}''', see also [[Itmam al-hujjah]]); the implication being that they bear witness to the truth before other people in such a complete and ultimate manner that no one is left with an excuse to deny the truth.&lt;ref name="jihad"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ghamidi | first = Javed | authorlink = Javed Ahmed Ghamidi | title = [[Mizan]] | publisher = [[Al-Mawrid|Dar ul-Ishraq]] |chapter=The Islamic Law of Jihad |chapter-url=http://www.studying-islam.org/articletext.aspx?id=771 | year = 2001 | doi = | OCLC=52901690 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a dispute among Islamic jurists as to whether the act of being "witness" was only for the [[Sahaba|Companions]] of Muhammad or whether this responsibility is still being held by modern Muslims, which may entitle them to take actions to subdue other Non-Muslim nations. Proponents of [[Sahaba|Companions]] of Muhammad as being "the witness" translate the following verse only for the Companions&lt;ref name="jihad" /&gt; while others translate it for the whole [[Ummah|Muslim nation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]], [[The Meaning of the Qur'an (tafsir)]], commentary on verse 2:143. [http://www.translatedquran.com/meaning.asp?sno=2&amp;tno=79 Translatedquran.com]&lt;/ref&gt; As in Quran:
{{quote|And similarly [O [[Sahaba|Companions]] of the [[Muhammad|Prophet]]!] We have made you an intermediate group&lt;ref&gt;This means that this group stands between Muhammad and the rest of the world who were able to observe the whole process of''witnessing''&lt;/ref&gt; so that you be witnesses [to this religion] before the nations, and the Messenger be such a witness before you.|Quran 2:143|}}

Similarly, proponents of the companions of Muhammad as being "the witness" present the following verse to argue that the companions were chosen people as witnesses just as God chooses Messengers from mankind. As in Quran:&lt;ref name="jihad" /&gt;

{{quote|And strive in His cause as ye ought to strive, (with sincerity and under discipline). He has chosen you, and has imposed no difficulties on you in religion; it is the religion of your father Abraham. It is He Who has named you Muslims, both before and in this [Quran]: [He chose you so that] the Messenger may be a witness [of this religion] to you, and you be witnesses of this religion to non-Muslims [of your times].|Quran|{{Quran-usc|22|78}}||}}

Following is the first verse of the Quran in which the Companions of Muhammad, who had migrated from Mecca, were given permission to fight back if they were attacked:&lt;ref name="jihad" /&gt;

{{quote|Permission to take up arms is hereby given to those who are attacked because they have been oppressed – Allah indeed has the power to grant them victory – those who have been unjustly driven from their homes, only because they said: "Our Lord is Allah".|Quran|{{Quran-usc-range|22|39|40}}||}}

The reason for this directive in Medina instead of Mecca considered by most Muslim scholars is that without political authority armed offensives become tantamount to spreading disorder and anarchy in the society. As one of Islamic jurist writes:

{{quote|Among ''Kafayah'' obligations, the third category is that for which the existence of a ruler is necessary e.g., ''Jihad'' and execution of punishments. Therefore, only a ruler has this prerogative. Because, indeed, no one else has the right to punish another person.|Sayyid Sabiq|Fiqhu'l-Sunnah, 2nd ed., vol. 3, (Beirut: Daru'l-Fikr, 1980), p. 30}}

===Subduing the enemy===
These verses told Muslims that they should not merely fight the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Banu Quraish]] if they resist them in offering [[Hajj]], but the Quran goes on to say that they should continue to fight them until persecution is uprooted and Islam prevails in the whole of [[Arabia]]. Initially, Muslims were required to fulfil this responsibility even if the enemy was 10 times stronger. Afterwards, the Quran reduced the burden of this responsibility.&lt;ref name="jihad" /&gt; As in Quran:

{{quote|Prophet! Rouse the believers to wage war. If there are twenty amongst you, patient and persevering, they will subdue two hundred: if a hundred, they will subdue a thousand of the disbelievers: for these are a people without understanding.|Quran|{{Quran-usc|8|65}}||}}

{{quote|[From] now, God has lightened your [task] for He knows that there is now weakness amongst you: But [ever so], if there are a hundred of you, patient and persevering, they will subdue two hundred, and if a thousand, they will subdue two thousand, with the leave of God: for God is with those who patiently persevere.|Quran|{{Quran-usc|8|66}}||}}

Some interpret above verses that ''Jihad'' never becomes obligatory unless the military might of the Muslims reaches a certain level. In the times of Muhammad, when large-scale conversions took place in the later phase, the Quran reduced the Muslim to enemy ratio to 1:2. It seems that Muslims should not only consolidate their moral character, but it is also imperative for them to build their military might if they want to wage ''Jihad'' when the need arises. The Quran gave a similar directive to Muslims of Muhammad's times in the following words:&lt;ref name="jihad" /&gt;

{{quote|Muster against them all the men and cavalry at your disposal so that you can strike terror into the enemies of Allah and of the believers and others besides them who may be unknown to you, though Allah knows them. And remember whatever you spend for the cause of Allah shall be repaid to you. You shall not be wronged.|Quran|{{Quran-usc|8|60}}||}}

Other scholars consider the later command of ratio 1:2 only for a particular time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]].''[[Tafhim al-Quran]]''. [http://www.translatedquran.com/meaning.asp?sno=8&amp;tno=253 Verse 8:66] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120913034315/http://www.translatedquran.com/meaning.asp?sno=8&amp;tno=253 |date=13 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A policy was adopted regarding the extent of the requirement that arose in wars that the Muslims had to fight. In the battles of [[Battle of Badr|Badr]], [[Uhud]] and [[Tabuk, Saudi Arabia|Tabuk]], the response was much more and each Muslim was required to present his services as a combatant.&lt;ref name="jihad" /&gt; As in Quran:

{{quote|Not equal are those of the believers who sit [at home] without any [genuine] excuse and those who strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has given preference by a degree to those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit [at home]. [In reality], for each, Allah has made a good promise and [in reality] Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight above those who sit [at home] by a huge reward. Degrees of [higher] grades from Him and forgiveness and mercy. And Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.|Quran|{{Quran-usc-range|4|95|96}}||}}

Quran also states that turning backs in the battlefield, except for tactical purposes, is a big sin and will bring wrath of God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amin Ahsan Islahi]], [[Tadabbur-i-Quran]], 2nd ed., vol. 3, (Lahore: Faran Foundation, 1986), pp. 450–51&lt;/ref&gt; As in Quran:
{{quote|O you who believe! when you meet those who disbelieve marching for war, then turn not your backs to them. And whoever shall turn his back to them on that day – unless he turn aside for the sake of fighting or withdraws to a company – then he, indeed, becomes deserving of Allah's wrath, and his abode is hell; and an evil destination shall it be.|Quran|{{Quran-usc-range|8|15|16}}||}}

{{quote|So when you meet those who disbelieve, then strike the necks until when you have subdued then bind firmly the bond, then either a favour afterwards or ransom until lays down the war its burdens. That. And if Allah had willed surely, He could have taken retribution from them, but to test some of you with others. And those who are killed in (the) way of Allah, then never He will cause to be lost their deeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ayah Muhammad 47:4 | url=http://islamawakened.com/quran/47/4/default.htm | access-date=13 January 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612224451/http://islamawakened.com/quran/47/4/default.htm | archive-date=12 June 2017 |dead-url=bot: unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Proper fighting motivation===
Islamic scholars agree that ''Jihad'' should not be undertaken to gratify one's whims nor to obtain wealth and riches. Many also consider that it must also not be undertaken to conquer territories and rule them or to acquire fame or to appease the emotions of communal support, partisanship and animosity. On the contrary, it should be undertaken only for the cause of Allah as is evident from the words.&lt;ref name="jihad" /&gt; As in Quran:

{{quote|Those who believe, fight in the cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve, fight in the cause of Satan. So fight you against the friends of Satan. Ever feeble indeed is the plot of Satan. |Quran|{{Quran-usc|4|76}}||}}

Muhammad, in various instances, also explained very forcefully this purport of the Quran:
* Abu Musa Ash'ari narrates that once a person came to Muhammad and said that some people fight for the spoils of war, some for fame and some to show off their valour; he then asked Muhammad: "Which of them fight in the way of Allah". Muhammad replied: "Only that person fights in the way of Allah who sets foot in the battlefield to raise high the name of Allah". [[Sahih Bukhari]] 2810
* Abu Hurayrah  narrates from Muhammad: "I swear by the Almighty that a person who is wounded in the way of Allah – and Allah knows full well who is actually wounded in His way – he would be raised on the Day of Judgement such that his colour be the colour of blood with the fragrance of musk around him". Sahih Bukhari 2803
* Ibn Jabr narrates from Muhammad: "A person whose feet become dust ridden because of [striving] in the way of Allah will never be touched by the flames of Hell". Sahih Bukhari 2811
* Sahal Ibn Sa'ad says that Muhammad once said: "To reside in a border area for a day to protect [people] against an enemy [invasion] is better than this world and everything it has". Sahih Bukhari 2892.

Similarly, as a reward for participation in such a strive, the Quran states:

{{quote|Consider not those who are killed in the way of Allah as dead. Nay, they are alive with their Lord, and they will be provided for. They rejoice in what Allah has bestowed upon them of His bounty and rejoice for the sake of those who have not yet joined them, but are left behind [not yet martyred] that on them too no fear shall come, nor shall they grieve. They rejoice in a grace and a bounty from Allah, and that Allah will not waste the reward of the believers..|Quran|{{Quran-usc-range|3|169|171}}||}}

; Opportunities for plunder and reward in heaven
[[Sura 4]] verses 71–76 urge Muslims to liberate the oppressed and also warns those who stay behind and fail to fight that they shall miss out on plunder, but those who fight and slain shall go to heaven:

{{quote|O you who believe! Take your precautions, and either go forth (on an expedition) in parties or go forth all together. There is certainly among you he who would linger behind (from fighting in Allah's Cause). If a misfortune befalls you, he says, "Indeed Allah has favoured me in that I was not present among them." But if a bounty (victory and booty) comes to you from Allah, he would surely say – as if there had never been ties of affection between you and him – "Oh! I wish I had been with them; then I would have achieved a great success ( a good share of booty)." Let those (believers) who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter fight in the Cause of Allah, and whoso fights in the Cause of Allah, and is killed or gets a victory, We shall bestow on him a great reward. And what is wrong with you that you fight not in the Cause of Allah, and for those weak, ill-treated and oppressed among men, women, and children, whose cry is: "Our Lord! Rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors, and raise for us from You one who will protect, and raise for us from You one who will help." Those who believe, fight in the Cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve, fight in the cause of Taghut (Satan, etc.). So fight you against the friends of Shaitan (Satan); Ever feeble indeed is the plot of Shaitan (Satan). |Quran (translator: [[Muhsin Khan]])|{{Quran-usc-range|4|71|76}}||}}

Most Muslim scholars consider it an eternal directive and believe that all types of oppression should be considered under this directive.&lt;ref name="jihad" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Concept of Dar Al-Islam and Dar Al-Harb'', [http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503544498 Islam online (English), ask scholar] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206011857/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE |date=6 December 2007 }}, Islamonline.net.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, if a group of Muslims commit unwarranted aggression against some of their brothers and does not desist from it even after all attempts of reconciliation, such a group according to the Quran should be fought with:

{{quote|And if two parties or groups among the believers start fighting, then make peace between them both. But if one of them outrages against the other, then fight you against the one which outrages till it complies with the command of Allah. Then if it complies, make reconciliation between them justly, and be equitable. Verily! Allah loves those who are equitable. The believers are brothers to one another. So make reconciliation between your brothers, and fear Allah that you may receive mercy.|Quran|{{Quran-usc-range|49|9|10}}||}}

===Regulation of warfare===
{{Main|Islamic military jurisprudence|Islamic ethics}}

[[Sharia|Islamic Law]], based upon the Quran and practices of Muhammad has set down a set of laws to be observed during the lesser Jihad.

Quran forbids fighting in the sacred month and similarly within the boundaries of [[Haram]] (the area around the Grand Mosque of Mecca). But if non-Muslims disregard these sanctities, Muslims are asked to retaliate in equal measure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amin Ahsan Islahi]], [[Tadabbur-i-Quran]], 2nd ed., vol. 3, (Lahore: Faran Foundation, 1986), pp. 479–80&lt;/ref&gt; It is stated in Quran:

{{quote|A sacred month for a sacred month; [similarly] other sacred things too are subject to retaliation. So if anyone transgresses against you, you should also pay back in equal coins. Have fear of Allah and [keep in mind that] Allah is with those who remain within the bounds [stipulated by religion].|Quran|{{Quran-usc|2|194}}||}}

Observance of treaties and pacts is stressed in the Quran. When some Muslims were still in Mecca, and they could not migrate to Medina, the Quran stated:

{{quote|And to those who accepted faith but did not migrate [to Madinah], you owe no duty of protection to them until they migrate; but if they seek your help in religion, it is your duty to help them except against a people with whom you have a treaty of mutual alliance; and Allah is the All-Seer of what you do.|Quran|{{Quran-usc|8|72}}||}}

Similar reports are attributed to Muhammad:
*Abu Sa'id narrates from Muhammad: "On the [[Day of Judgment]], to proclaim the traitorous actions of a traitor and the betrayal of a person who betrayed his words, a flag shall be hoisted which would be as high as [the extent of his] traitorous behaviour", and Muhammad also said: "Remember that no traitor and betrayer of promises is greater than the one who is the leader and ruler of people". [[Sahih Muslim]] 1738

The basic principle in fighting in the Quran is that other communities should be treated as one's own. Fighting is justified for legitimate self-defence, to aid other Muslims and after a violation in the terms of a treaty, but should be stopped if these circumstances cease to exist.&lt;ref name="Boundaries_Princeton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crone"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Micheline R. Ishay, ''The History of Human Rights: From Ancient Times to the Globalization Era'', [[University of California Press]], p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas M. Johnston, ''Faith-Based Diplomacy: Trumping Realpolitik'', [[Oxford University Press]], p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of forgiveness is reiterated in between the assertions of the right to [[self-defence]].&lt;ref name="Crone"/&gt;

During his life, Muhammad gave various injunctions to his forces and adopted practices toward the conduct of war. The most important of these were summarized by Muhammad's companion, [[Abu Bakr]], in the form of ten rules for the [[Rashidun army|Muslim army]]:

{{quote|Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kills a child, nor a woman, nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monastic services; leave them alone.|Abu Bakr|&lt;ref&gt;Aboul-Enein and Zuhur, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These injunctions were honored by the second [[Caliph]], [[Umar]], during whose reign (634–644) important [[Muslim conquests]] took place.&lt;ref&gt;Nadvi(2000), p. 519&lt;/ref&gt; These principles were also honoured during the [[Crusades]], as exemplified by sultans such as [[Saladin]] and [[al-Kamil]]. For example, after al-Kamil defeated the [[Franks]] during the [[Crusades]], Oliverus Scholasticus praised the Islamic [[laws of war]], commenting on how al-Kamil supplied the defeated Frankish army with food:&lt;ref name=Weeramantry&gt;{{citation|title=Justice Without Frontiers|first=Christopher G.|last=Judge Weeramantry|year=1997|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=90-411-0241-8|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Who could doubt that such goodness, friendship and charity come from God? Men whose parents, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, had died in agony at our hands, whose lands we took, whom we drove naked from their homes, revived us with their own food when we were dying of hunger and showered us with kindness even when we were in their power.|Oliverus Scholasticus|&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Justice Without Frontiers|first=Christopher G.|last=Judge Weeramantry|year=1997|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=90-411-0241-8|pages=136–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the [[Battle of Siffin]], the Caliph [[Ali]] stated that Islam does not permit Muslims to stop the supply of water to their enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia of Islam (2005), p.204&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun Caliphs]], hadiths attributed to Muhammad himself suggest that he stated the following regarding the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]]:

{{quote|You are going to enter [[Egypt]] a land where ''qirat'' (money unit) is used. Be extremely good to them as they have with us close ties and marriage relationships. When you enter Egypt after my death, recruit many soldiers from among the [[Egyptians]] because they are the best soldiers on earth, as they and their wives are permanently on duty until the [[Islamic view of the Last Judgment|Day of Resurrection]]. Be good to the [[Copt]]s of Egypt; you shall take them over, but they shall be your instrument and help. Be Righteous to [[God]] about the Copts.&lt;ref name=Daly-18&gt;{{citation|title=Egyptology: The Missing Millennium : Ancient Egypt in Medieval Arabic Writings|first=Okasha|last=El Daly|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2004|isbn=1-84472-063-2|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The early Islamic treatises on [[international law]] from the 9th century onwards covered the application of [[Islamic economic jurisprudence]], ethics and military jurisprudence to international law,&lt;ref name=Kelsay&gt;{{citation|title=Al-Shaybani and the Islamic Law of War|last=Kelsay|first=J.|journal=Journal of Military Ethics|volume=2|issue=1|date=March 2003|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=63–75|doi=10.1080/15027570310000027}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were concerned with a number of modern international law topics, including the [[law of treaties]]; the treatment of [[diplomat]]s, [[hostage]]s, [[refugee]]s and [[prisoners of war]]; the [[right of asylum]]; [[Laws of war|conduct on the battlefield]]; protection of women, children and [[non-combatant]] [[civilian]]s; [[contract]]s across the lines of [[battle]]; the use of [[poison]]ous weapons; and devastation of enemy territory.&lt;ref name=Weeramantry /&gt;

=== Al-Anfal 39 ===
According to verses {{Quran-usc-range|8|39}}, the objectives of Muslims in their fighting should be to:&lt;ref name="jihad" /&gt;
#Put a stop to tumult, oppression injustice (Uproot ''fitnah'' ('''{{lang|ar|[[Wiktionary:فتنة|فتنة]]}}''') or persecution, some scholars argue that the word fitnah means [[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]]&lt;ref name=HExplanations&gt;{{cite web|title=Hadith Explanation|url=http://dailyhadith.adaptivesolutionsinc.com/hadith/Love-of-Muslims.htm|publisher=Hadith Explanations|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; )
#Establish supremacy of God, through Islam, in the Arabian Peninsula

====Against persecution====
Directives for action against persecution and unbelief:

====Supremacy of Islam====
The Quran emphasizes the supremacy of Islam as well as Islam's messenger (Muhammad):

{{quote|Indeed those who are opposing Allah and His Messenger are bound to be humiliated. The Almighty has ordained: ''I and My Messengers shall always prevail''. Indeed Allah is Mighty and Powerful.|Quran|{{Quran-usc-range|58|20|21}}||}}

{{quote|It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest ''it over all religion'', although they who associate others with Allah dislike it.|Quran|{{Quran-usc-range|9|33}}||}}

===Military campaigns of Muhammad and his companions===
After [[Itmam al-hujjah]] (clarification of religion to the addressees in its ultimate form), [[Jew]]s were subdued first and had been granted [[amnesty]] because of various pacts. Those among them who violated these pacts were given the punishment of denying a Messenger of God.&lt;ref name="jihad" /&gt; Muhammad exiled the tribe of [[Banu Qaynuqa]] to [[Khaybar|Khyber]] and that of [[Banu Nadir]] to [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="Hisham_40_42_151_160"&gt;[[Ibn Hisham]], al-Sirah al-Nabawiyyah, 2nd ed., vol. 3, (Beirut: Daru'l-Khayr, 1995), pp. 40–42, 151–60&lt;/ref&gt; the Banu Qaynuqa at [[Khaybar|Khyber]] was crushed by an attack at their strongholds.&lt;ref name="Hisham_40_42_151_160"/&gt; Prior to this, [[Abu al-Rafi ibn Abu al-Huqayq|Abu al-Rafi]] and [[Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf]] were put to death in their houses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Hisham]], al-Sirah al-Nabawiyyah, 2nd ed., vol. 3, (Beirut: Daru'l-Khayr, 1995), pp. 43–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Sa'ad, al-Tabaqatu'l-Kubra, vol. 2, (Beirut: Dar Sadir, 1960), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The tribe of [[Banu Qurayza]] was guilty of treachery and disloyalty in the battle of the Ahzab.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Hisham]], al-Sirah al-Nabawiyyah, 2nd ed., vol. 3, (Beirut: Daru'l-Khayr, 1995), pp. 180–82&lt;/ref&gt; When the clouds of war dispersed and the chances of an external attack no longer remained, Muhammad laid siege around them. When no hope remained, they asked Muhammad to appoint [[Sa'd ibn Mua'dh]] as an arbitrator to decide their fate. Their request was accepted. Since, at that time, no specific punishment had been revealed in the Quran about the fate of the Jews, [[Sa'd ibn Mua'dh]] announced his verdict in accordance with the [[Torah]]. As per the Torah, the punishment in such situations was that all men should be put to death; the women and children should be made slaves and the wealth of the whole nation should be distributed among the conquerors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deuteronomy]], [http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=20 20:10-14]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Caesar E. Farah]]. [[Islam: Beliefs and Observances]], pp.52&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with this verdict pronounced, all men were executed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Hisham]], al-Sirah al-Nabawiyyah, 2nd ed., vol. 3, (Beirut: Daru'l-Khayr, 1995), pp. 188–89&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Esposito]] writes that Muhammad's use of warfare, in general, was alien neither to Arab custom nor to that of the Hebrew prophets, as both believed that God had sanctioned battle with the enemies of the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Esposito]](2005), ''Islam: The Straight Path'', p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

No other incident of note took place regarding the Jews until the revelation of [[At-Tawba]], the final judgement, was declared against them:&lt;ref name="jihad" /&gt;

{{quote|Fight those who believe not in Allah or the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the Religion of Truth, from among the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission and are subdued.|Quran|{{Quran-usc|9|29}}||}}

This directive related to both the Jews and the Christians. The punishment mentioned in these verses is a show of leniency to them because they were originally adherents to monotheism. The story holds that they did not benefit from this leniency because, after Muhammad's death, they once again resorted to [[fraud]] and treachery.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 2730&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Abu Yusuf]], Kitab al-kharaj, Fasl fi'l-Fay wa al-Khiraj, (1302 AH), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ahmad Ibn Yahya al-Baladhuri]], Futuhu'l-Buldan, (Qumm: Manshurat al-Arummiyyah, 1404 AH), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Athir]], Al-Kamil fi'l-Tarikh, 1st ed., vol. 2, (Beirut: Dar Beirut, 1965), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the Jews of [[Khaybar|Khyber]] and the Christians of [[Najran]] were exiled once and for all from the Arabian peninsula by [[Umar]]. This exile actually fulfilled the following declaration of the Quran about them:&lt;ref name="jihad" /&gt;

{{quote|And had it not been that Allah had decreed exile for them, He would certainly have punished them in this world; and in the Hereafter, theirs shall be the torment of the Fire.|Quran|{{Quran-usc|59|3}}||}}

In contrast, when the [[polytheism|polytheists]] of Arabia had been similarly subdued, it was proclaimed in [[At-Tawba]] that in future no pact would be made with them. They would be given a final respite of four months and then they would be humiliated in retribution for their deeds and would in no way be able to escape from this punishment. After this time limit, the declaration is made in the Quran:&lt;ref name="jihad" /&gt;

{{quote|And a declaration should be made from Allah and His Messenger to these people on the day of the great Hajj that Allah is free from [all] obligations to these Idolaters and so is His Messenger. So if you [O Idolaters!] repent, it is better for you, but if you turn away, then know that you cannot escape from the grasp of Allah. And give tidings [O Muhammad] of a painful torment to these disbelievers. Except those of these Idolaters with whom you have a treaty, and who have not shown treachery in it nor have supported anyone against you. So fulfil their treaty to the end of their term. Indeed, Allah loves those who abide by the limits. Then when the sacred months [after the [[Hajj]]] have passed, kill these Idolaters wherever you find them, and capture them and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in each and every ambush. But if they repent and establish the prayer, and give Zakah, then leave them alone. Indeed, Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.|Quran|{{Quran-usc-range|9|3|5}}||}}

After the [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah]], Muhammad himself singled out nations by writing letters to them. In all, they were written to the heads of eight countries.&lt;ref&gt;The names of these heads of state are 1. Negus of Abyssinia, 2. Maqawqas of Egypt, 3. Khusro Parvez of Persia, 4. Qaysar of Rome, 5. Mundhar Ibn Sawi of Bahrain, 6. Hudhah Ibn 'Ali of Yamamah, 7. Harith Ibn Abi Shamir of Damascus, 8. Jayfar of Amman, see [[Muhammad as a diplomat]]&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, after consolidating their rule in the Arabian peninsula, the [[Sahaba|Companions]] launched attacks against these countries giving them two options if they wanted to avoid war: to accept [[Islam|faith]] or to become a [[dhimmi]] by paying the [[Jizya]]. None of these nations was considered to be adherents to [[polytheism]], otherwise, they would have been treated in the same way as the Idolaters of Arabia.&lt;ref name="jihad" /&gt;

====Battle of Badr====
{{Main|Battle of Badr}}

Since their emigration from Mecca (622), the Muslims in Medina had depended not on farming or trading, but on continuous raids on Meccan caravans. When word of a particularly wealthy caravan escorted by Abū Sufyān, head of the Umayyad clan, reached Muhammad, a raiding party of about 300 Muslims, to be led by Muhammad himself, was organized. By filling the wells on the caravan route near Medina with sand, the Muslims lured Abū Sufyān's army to battle at Badr, near Medina, in March 624. Despite the superior numbers of the Meccan forces (about 1,000 men), the Muslims scored a complete victory, and many prominent Meccans were killed. The success at Badr was recorded in the Qurʾān as a divine sanction of the new religion: "It was not you who slew them, it was God…in order that He might test the Believers by a gracious trial from Himself" (8:17).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/48575/Battle-of-Badr&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Surprise attack=====
 
The [[Qur'an]] commands Muslims to make a proper declaration of war prior to the commencement of military operations. Thus, surprise [[Military strike|attacks]] are illegal under the Islamic jurisprudence. The Qur'an had similarly commanded Muhammad to give his enemies, who had violated the [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah]], a time period of four months to reconsider their position and negotiate.&lt;ref&gt;Maududi (1967), p. 177, vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This rule, however, is not binding if the adversary has already started the war.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Maududi (1998), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; [[Religious persecution|Forcible prevention of religious practice]] is considered as an act of war in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Peace verses==

[[Khaled Abou El Fadl]] notes several verses that can easily be interpreted in support of tolerance and diversity – a precondition for peaceful coexistence. Quran 49:13, 11:118–9, 5:48 indicate an expectation and acceptance of diversity among human beings: that diversity is part of "divine intent"; including diversity of religion:&lt;ref name=KAEF-15-17&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N3FIT27sjWAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=place+of+tolerance+in+islam+el+fadl&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnms6Ah4LTAhUB84MKHdGBA_IQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=place%20of%20tolerance%20in%20islam%20el%20fadl&amp;f=false|title=The Place of Tolerance in Islam|last=Abou El Fadl|first=Khaled|last2=Lague|first2=Ian|date=2002 |publisher=Beacon Press|year=|isbn=9780807002292|location=|pages=15–17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11478">The '''water, energy and food security nexus''' means that [[water security]], [[energy security]] and [[food security]] are inextricably linked and that actions in any one area usually have impacts in one or both of the others. As the [[world population]] approaches 8 billion, with increasing demands for basic services, and growing desires for higher [[living standards]], the need for more conscious stewardship of the vital resources required to achieve those services and desires has become both more obvious and urgent.&lt;ref name = lowCDesal&gt;{{Cite journal  | title = Low Carbon Desalination: Status and Research, Development, and Demonstration Needs | url = https://jwafs.mit.edu/node/66| author = J H Lienhard, G P Thiel, D M Warsinger, L D Banchik| journal = Report of a Workshop Conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Association with the Global Clean Water Desalination Alliance, MIT Abdul Latif Jameel World Water and Food Security Lab, Cambridge, Massachusetts.  | date = 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Definitions==
* [[Water security]] is defined in the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) as "access to safe [[drinking water]] and [[sanitation]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.undp.org/mdg/goal7.shtml UNDP: Millennium Development Goals, Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability]&lt;/ref&gt; both of which have recently become a [[human right]]. While not part of most water security definitions yet, availability of and access to water for other human and [[ecosystem]] uses is also very important from a nexus perspective.
* [[Energy security]] has been defined as "access to clean, reliable and affordable energy services for cooking and heating, lighting, communications and productive uses" ([[United Nations]]),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/climatechange/shared/Documents/AGECC%20summary%20report%5B1%5D.pdf UN Secretary General’s Advisory Group on Energy and Climate Change (AGECC), Summary Report and Recommendations, 28 April 2010, p. 13]&lt;/ref&gt; and as "uninterrupted physical availability [of energy] at a price which is affordable, while respecting environment concerns".
* [[Food security]] is defined by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) as "availability and access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet the dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/W3613E/W3613E00.HTM FAO. 1996. Rome Declaration on World Food Security and World Food Summit Plan of Action. World Food Summit 13–17 November 1996. Rome.]&lt;/ref&gt; Adequate food has also been defined as a human right.

The emphasis on access in these definitions also implies that security is not so much about average (e.g., annual) availability of resources; it has to encompass variability and extreme situations such as droughts or price shocks, and the [[psychological resilience]] of the poor.

== Interactions among the water, energy and food security sectors ==

The interactions among water, energy and food are numerous and substantial. Water is used for [[Extraction of petroleum|extraction]], [[mining]], [[Process (engineering)|processing]], [[refining]], and residue disposal of [[fossil fuels]], as well as for growing [[feedstock]] for [[biofuels]] and for generating [[electricity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Wells to wheels: water consumption for transportation fuels in the United States|url = http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C5EE03254G|journal = Energy Environ. Sci.|volume = 9|issue = 3|pages = 787–802|doi = 10.1039/c5ee03254g|language = en|first = David J.|last = Lampert|first2 = Hao|last2 = Cai|first3 = Amgad|last3 = Elgowainy|date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water intensity varies in the energy sector, with [[oil]] and [[gas]] production requiring much less water than oil from [[tar sands]] or [[biofuels]]. Choosing [[biofuels]] for energy production should require a careful balancing of priorities, since water that has been used to grow [[feedstock]] for [[biofuels]] could also have been used to grow [[food]].

Many forms of [[energy production]] through [[fossil fuels]] are highly polluting in addition to being water intensive, especially extraction from [[tar sands]] and [[shale]] and extraction through [[hydraulic fracturing]]. Further, return flows from [[power plants]] to rivers are warmer than the water that was taken in and/or are highly polluted and can consequently compromise other downstream usage, including [[ecosystems]]. Conversely, energy is needed for extracting, transporting, distributing and treating water. Energy intensity for accessing a cubic meter of water varies: logically, accessing local [[surface water]] requires far less energy than pumping [[groundwater]], reclaiming [[wastewater]] or [[desalination|desalinating]] [[seawater]]. [[Irrigation]] is more energy intensive than [[rain-fed agriculture]], and [[drip irrigation]] is more intensive yet since the water must be pressurized.

[[Food production]] is by far the largest consumer of global [[fresh water]] supplies. Globally, [[agriculture]] is responsible for an average of 70% of [[fresh water]] consumption by humans; in some countries that figure jumps to 80%-90%. [[Agriculture]] is therefore also responsible for much of [[fresh water]] over-exploitation. [[Food production]] further impacts the water sector through [[land degradation]], changes in runoff, disruption of [[groundwater discharge]], [[water quality]] and availability of water and land for other purposes such as natural habitat. The increased yields that have resulted from mechanization and other modern measures have come at a high energy price, as the full food and [[supply chain]] claims approximately 30% of total global [[energy demand]]. Energy fuels [[land preparation]], [[fertilizer]] production, [[irrigation]] and the sowing, harvesting and transportation of crops. The links between [[food]] and [[energy]] have become quite apparent in recent years as increases in the price of [[oil]] lead very quickly to increases in the price of [[food]]. The energy sector can have other negative impacts on the food sector when [[mining]] for [[fossil fuels]] and [[deforestation]] for [[biofuels]] reduce land for [[agriculture]], [[ecosystems]] and other uses.

== Nexus approach ==

Improved [[water security|water]], [[energy security|energy]] and [[food security]] on a global level can be achieved through a [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] approach — an approach that integrates management and [[governance]] across sectors and scales. A nexus approach can support the transition to a [[Green Economy]], which aims, among other things, at [[resource efficiency|resource use efficiency]] and greater [[Policy Coherence for Development|policy coherence]]. Given the increasing interconnectedness across sectors and in space and time, a reduction of negative economic, social and environmental [[externalities]] can increase overall resource use efficiency, provide additional benefits and secure the [[human right to water|human rights to water]] and [[food]]. In a nexus-based approach, conventional policy- and decision-making in "silos" therefore would give way to an approach that reduces trade-offs and builds [[synergies]] across sectors. The European Union, working along with the German Federal Ministry for Economics Cooperation and Development and the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]], the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and the [[World Economic Forum]] have developed an online resource&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.water-energy-food.org/|accessdate=29 October 2018|title=NEXUS Resource Platform}}&lt;/ref&gt; on this concern. Nexus approach requires an integrated solution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-05-01|title=Food, water, and energy security in South Asia: A nexus perspective from the Hindu Kush Himalayan region☆|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901114000239|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Policy|volume=39|pages=35–48|doi=10.1016/j.envsci.2014.01.010|issn=1462-9011|last1=Rasul|first1=Golam}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Nexus perspective ==

A nexus perspective increases the understanding of the interdependencies across the water, energy and food sectors and influences policies in other areas of concern such as [[climate]] and [[biodiversity]]. The nexus perspective helps to move beyond silos and [[ivory tower]]s that preclude [[interdisciplinary]] solutions, thus increasing opportunities for mutually beneficial responses and enhancing the potential for [[cooperation]] between and among all sectors. Everyone in all disciplines needs to think and act from the perspective of being interlinked in order to realize the full impact of both direct and indirect [[synergies]] that can result.

A deep understanding of the nexus will provide the informed and transparent framework that is required to meet increasing global demands without compromising [[sustainability]]. The nexus approach will also allow decision-makers to develop appropriate policies, strategies and investments, to explore and exploit synergies, and to identify and mitigate trade-offs among the development goals related to water, energy and food security. Active participation by and among government agencies, the private sector and civil society is critical to avoiding unintended adverse consequences. A true nexus approach can only be achieved through close collaboration of all actors from all sectors.

While the opportunities provided by the nexus perspective and the consequent social, environmental and economic benefits are real, implementation requires the right policies, incentives and encouragement, and institutions and leaders that are up to the task, as well as frameworks that encourage empowerment, research, information and education. Accelerating the involvement of the private sector through establishing and promoting the business case for both sustainability and the nexus is essential to driving change and getting to scale.

Nexus perspective can be an option for adaptation to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rasul|first=Golam|date=April 2015|title=The nexus approach to water–energy–food security: an option for adaptation to climate change|journal=Climate Policy|volume=16|issue=6|pages=682–702|doi=10.1080/14693062.2015.1029865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water transportation''' is the intentional movement of [[water]] over large distances. Methods of transportation fall into three categories:

* [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|Aqueduct]]s, which include [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], [[canal]]s, and [[tunnel]]s
* container shipment, which includes transport by [[tank truck]], [[tank car]], and [[tanker (ship)|tank ship]].
* towing, where a [[tugboat]] is used to pull an [[iceberg]] or a [[Flexible barge|large water bag]] along behind it.

Due to its weight, transportation of water is very energy intensive. Unless it has the assistance of gravity, a canal or long-distance pipeline will need [[pumping station]]s at regular intervals. In this regard, the lower [[friction]] levels of the canal make it a more economical solution than the pipeline. Water transportation is also very common along rivers and oceans.

== Major water transportation projects ==
The [[Grand Canal of China]], finished in the 7th Century AD and measuring {{convert|1794|km|mi}}.

The [[California Aqueduct]], near Sacramento, is {{convert|715|km|mi|abbr=on}} long.

The [[Great Manmade River]] is a vast underground network of pipes (1600 kilometres / 994 miles) in the [[Sahara desert]], transporting water from an immense [[aquifer]] to the largest cities in the region.

The [[Keita Integrated Development Project]] used specially created plows called the donaldo and Scarabeo to build [[water catchments]]. In these catchments, trees were planted which grow on the water flowing through the ditches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/p22413r257105873/fulltext.pdf?page=1 Keita project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lintenditore.com/userfiles/docs/PRTDSAschedaprogetto.pdf Keita project plows]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Kimberley Water Source Project is currently underway in [[Australia]] to determine the best method of transporting water from the [[Fitzroy River (Western Australia)|Fitzroy River]] to the city of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. Options being considered include a 3,700 kilometre canal, a pipeline of at least 1,800 kilometres, tankers of 300,000 to 500,000 tonnes, and water bags each carrying between 0.5 and 1.5 [[litre|gigalitres]].

The [[Goldfields Pipeline]] built in [[Western Australia]] in 1903 was the longest pipeline of its day at 597 kilometres. It supplies water from [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] to [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]]'s gold mining industry.

==Manual water transportation==

Historically water was transported by hand in dry countries, by traditional waterers such as the sakkas of Arabia and [[Bhishti]] of India. Africa is another area where water is often transported by hand, especially so in rural areas.

The French scholar [[Françoise Thom]] identified four characteristics of wooden language: abstraction and the avoidance of the concrete, tautologies, bad metaphors, and Manichaeism that divides the world into good and evil.&lt;ref name=Kakutani2018/&gt;
It originally referred to wording imposed by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=Kakutani2018&gt;Michiko Kakutani, “[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/14/the-death-of-truth-how-we-gave-up-on-facts-and-ended-up-with-trump The death of truth].” The Guardian, 14 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  
The phrase is a literal translation of the [[French language|French]] expression ''{{lang|fr|langue de bois}}''. The French phrase became widely used during the 1970s and 1980s, arriving in the language from Russian via Polish.&lt;ref name =Caparini2006/&gt;

The fictional language of [[Newspeak]] in [[George Orwell]]’s novel [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]] often mirrors and satirizes wooden language.&lt;ref name=Kakutani2018/&gt;

The '''Yellow Turban Rebellion''', also translated as the '''Yellow Scarves Rebellion''', was a [[List of peasant revolts|peasant revolt]] in [[China]] against the [[Eastern Han dynasty]]. The uprising broke out in 184 AD during the reign of [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]]. Although the main rebellion was suppressed in a year by 185 AD, pockets of resistance continued and smaller new rebellions were started in later years. Thus, it took 21 years until the uprising was fully suppressed by 205 AD.&lt;ref name="Smitha 2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smitha|first1=Frank E|title=DYNASTIC RULE and the CHINESE (9 of 13)|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h1/china07.htm|website=Macrohistory and World Timeline|accessdate=19 February 2015|quote=By the year 205 (21 years after it had begun) the Yellow Turban Rebellion was over, and rule by the Han family was shattered and at its end.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion, which got its name from the colour of the cloths that the rebels wore on their heads, marked an important point in the [[history of Taoism]] due to the rebels' association with secret [[Taoism|Taoist]] societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowker|first1=John|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revolt was also used as the opening event in the 14th-century historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]''.

==Causes==
{{Further|History of the Han dynasty|Society and culture of the Han dynasty}}

A major cause of the rebellion was an agrarian crisis, in which famine forced many farmers and former military settlers in the north to seek employment in the south, where large landowners exploited the labour surplus to amass large fortunes. The situation was further aggravated by smaller floods along the lower course of the [[Yellow River]]. The peasants were further oppressed by high taxes imposed in order to fund the construction of fortifications along the [[Silk Road]] and garrisons against foreign infiltration and invasion. In this situation, landowners, landless peasants and unemployed former soldiers formed armed bands (around 170) and eventually private armies, setting the stage for armed conflict.

At the same time, the Han central government was weakening internally. The power of the landowners had become a longstanding problem, but in the run-up to the rebellion, the court [[eunuch]]s in particular gained considerably in influence over the emperor, which they abused to enrich themselves. Ten of the most powerful eunuchs formed a group known as the [[Ten Attendants]], and [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]] referred to one of them ([[Zhang Rang]]) as his "foster father". The government was widely regarded as corrupt and incapable and the famines and floods were seen as an indication that a decadent emperor had lost his [[Mandate of Heaven]].

Because of its plan for a new beginning, the Taoist sect of [[Zhang Jue]] proved to be the Han dynasty's most dangerous enemy. In preparation for his revolt, Zhang Jue sent disciples out to gain support and organise followers throughout north China. Political discontent, as well as droughts and plagues, fuelled public resentment against the Han government. The rebels even had allies in the imperial court, and they were able to make their preparations while government officials were either ignorant of their intentions or intimidated by their power.&lt;ref name=ANU/&gt;

Zhang Jue planned a rising throughout the Han Empire, but before the call to arms had been issued the plan was betrayed, the rebel sympathisers in [[Luoyang]] were arrested and executed, and the revolt in the provinces had to begin ahead of time, in the second month of 184. Despite the premature call and an inevitable lack of co-ordination, tens of thousands of men rose in rebellion, government offices were plundered and destroyed and the imperial armies were immediately forced onto the defensive.&lt;ref name=ANU/&gt;

==The rebels==
===Founders===
The rebellion was led by [[Zhang Jue]] (also referred to as Zhang Jiao, known to his followers as the "General of Heaven") and his two younger brothers Zhang Bao (張寶) and Zhang Liang (張梁), who were born in Julu [[Jun (country subdivision)|Commandery]] (present-day [[Pingxiang County]], [[Hebei]]). The brothers had founded a Taoist religious sect in present-day [[Shandong]]. They were healers, usually accepting patients ''[[pro bono]]'' who could not afford to pay them. The brothers saw the harshness of the world through their work with the peasants who were often abused by the local government, overburdened and hungry due to the heavy taxes levied upon them.

===Taoist sect===
The rebels were the first followers of the Way of Supreme Peace ({{zh|t=太平道|p=Tàipíng Dào|labels=no}}) and venerated the deity [[Huang–Lao]], who according to Zhang Jue, had given him a sacred book called the ''Crucial Keys to the Way of Peace'' ({{zh|t=太平要術|p=Tàipíng Yàoshù|labels=no}}) based on the ''[[Taipingjing]]''. Zhang Jue, who was said to be a sorcerer, called himself the "Great Teacher" (大賢良師). When the rebellion was proclaimed, Zhang Jue created a 16-word slogan: {{blockquote|"The Azure Sky{{efn|Referring to the Han government}} is already dead; the Yellow Sky{{efn|Referring to the Yellow Turban Rebellion}} will soon rise.&lt;br /&gt;When the year is ''[[Chinese calendar|jiǎzǐ]]'',{{efn|That is, at the beginning of the next [[Sexagenary cycle|cycle]]}} there will be prosperity [[Tianxia|under Heaven]]!"&lt;br&gt;({{zh|t=蒼天已死，黃天當立。歲在甲子，天下大吉。|labels=no}})}} Since all the three brothers were healers, they spread the slogan easily by telling their patients to spread it among the peasants.&lt;ref name="HHS 71 Yellow Turban Rebellion"&gt;(初，鉅鹿張角自稱「大賢良師」，奉事黃老道，畜養弟子，跪拜首過，符水咒說以療病，病者頗愈，百姓信向之。角因遣弟子八人使於四方，以善道教化天下，轉相誑惑。十餘年閒，眾徒數十萬，連結郡國，自青、徐、幽、冀、荊、楊、兗、豫八州之人，莫不畢應。遂置三十六方。方猶將軍號也。大方萬餘人，小方六七千，各立渠帥。訛言「蒼天已死，黃天當立，歲在甲子，天下大吉」。以白土書京城寺門及州郡官府，皆作「甲子」字。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious practices===
Zhang Jue used a form of Taoism to cure the sick by confession of sins and by [[faith healing]]. The religion and the politics of the Zhang brothers were based on belief in an apocalyptic change in the order of the world. They told their followers that in the ''[[Chinese calendar|jiazi]]'' year, the beginning of the new [[sexagenary cycle]], the sky would become yellow, and that under this new heaven the rule of the Han dynasty would end and a new era of government begin. The characters ''jiazi'' became a symbol of the coming change and, later, when the followers of Zhang Jue went to battle they wore a yellow cloth bound about their heads as a badge. From this came the term Yellow Turbans.&lt;ref name=ANU&gt;[http://www.anu.edu.au/asianstudies/decrespigny/gos_ch2.pdf ''Generals of the South'', Rafe de Crespigny] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915014903/http://www.anu.edu.au/asianstudies/decrespigny/gos_ch2.pdf |date=2007-09-15 }}(pp. 85–92)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all of the religious practices of the sect were communal activities (e.g. collective trances, fasts). A typical worship service consisted largely of music and chanting, the burning of incense, and sermons or anecdotes that could be given by any member of the congregation including women and those perceived as barbarians. Several [[Xiongnu]] leaders such as [[Yufuluo]] are known to have at least lent their support to the sect and a number of scholars have theorised that Zhang Jue may have derived some of his teachings from [[shamanism]] as he appeared as a mystical healer with a direct link to the heavens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Scripture on Great Peace: The Taiping Jing and the Beginnings of Daoism|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520932920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many of the beliefs of the early Path of Supreme Peace have been lost, it is very likely that they had some relation to the [[Way of the Celestial Masters]], considering Zhang Jue claimed to be a descendant of [[Zhang Daoling]]. Many of the writings found in the 52 surviving chapters of the ''[[Taiping Jing]]'' that are found in the ''[[Daozang]]'' have a direct relationship to the Way of the Celestial Masters. Regardless, it is quite likely that any discrepancies found within the Way were suppressed by later Taoist sects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=China: "Its History and Culture" | isbn=0-07-043424-7| author=W.Scott Morton }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zhang Jue's plans for rebellion==

Before the rebellion started, Zhang Jue had sent Ma Yuanyi (馬元義) to recruit followers from Jing and [[Yang Province|Yang]] provinces and gather them in [[Ye (ancient China)|Ye]]. As Ma Yuanyi frequently travelled to [[Luoyang]], the Han imperial capital, he managed to build connections with Feng Xu (封諝) and Xu Feng (徐奉), two members of the influential [[Ten Attendants|eunuch faction]] in the imperial court, and convince them to secretly collaborate with Zhang Jue. They set 3 April 184 as the date for the rebellion. However, before the plans were set in motion, Tang Zhou (唐周) betrayed Ma Yuanyi and reported him to the authorities. Ma Yuanyi was arrested and executed by dismemberment in Luoyang.&lt;ref name="Ma Yuanyi and Tang Zhou"&gt;(中平元年，大方馬元義等先收荊、楊數萬人，期會發於鄴。元義數往來京師，以中常侍封諝、徐奉等為內應，約以三月五日內外俱起。未及作亂，而張角弟子濟南唐周上書告之，於是車裂元義於洛陽。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ANU/&gt;

After Emperor Ling learnt that Zhang Jue was plotting a revolt, he ordered Zhou Bin (周斌), Prefect of the Palace Parks (鉤盾令), to conduct an investigation and capture all the conspirators. Hundreds of people were arrested and executed during this time.&lt;ref name="Zhou Bin"&gt;(靈帝以周章下三公、司隸，使鉤盾令周斌將三府掾屬，案驗宮省直衛及百姓有事角道者，誅殺千餘人，推考冀州，逐捕角等。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The rebellion==
When Zhang Jue heard that the Han government had caught wind about his plans to rebel, he quickly sent messengers to contact his allies throughout China and take action immediately. Sometime between 29 February and 29 March 184, Zhang Jue started the Yellow Turban Rebellion with some 360,000 followers under his command, all of whom wore yellow headscarves or turbans.&lt;ref name="HHS 8 Zhang Jue"&gt;(中平元年春二月，鉅鹿人張角自稱「黃天」，其部師有三十六萬，皆著黃巾，同日反叛。安平、甘陵人各執其王以應之。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; He called himself "Lord General of Heaven" (天公將軍), while his brothers Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang were respectively called "Lord General of Earth" (地公將軍) and "Lord General of People" (人公將軍). The rebels attacked government offices, pillaged counties and villages, and seized control of commanderies. Within 10 days, the rebellion had spread throughout China and caused much alarm to the Han imperial court in [[Luoyang]].&lt;ref name="Heaven, Earth, People Generals"&gt;角等知事已露，晨夜馳敕諸方，一時俱起。皆著黃巾為摽幟，角稱「天公將軍」，角弟寶稱「地公將軍」，寶弟梁稱「人公將軍」，所在燔燒官府，劫略聚邑，州郡失據，長吏多逃亡。旬日之閒，天下嚮應，京師震動。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebels were mostly concentrated in [[Ji Province|Ji]], [[Jing Province|Jing]], [[You Province|You]] and [[Yuzhou (ancient China)|Yu]] provinces. The group led by Zhang Jue and his brothers gained their support in Ji Province, located just north of the [[Yellow River]], near Zhang Jue's home territory of Julu Commandery (鉅鹿郡; around present-day [[Pingxiang County]], [[Hebei]]) and Wei Commandery (魏郡; around present-day [[Handan]], Hebei). A second major uprising took place in Guangyang Commandery (廣陽郡; around present-day [[Beijing]]) and Zhuo Commandery (涿郡; around present-day [[Zhuozhou]], Hebei) in You Province. The third centre of the rebellion was in Yingchuan Commandery (潁川郡; around present-day [[Xuchang]], [[Henan]]) and Runan Commandery (汝南郡; around present-day [[Xinyang]], Henan) in Yu Province, and Nanyang Commandery (南陽郡; around present-day [[Nanyang, Henan]]) in northern Jing Province.

On 1 April 184, Emperor Ling appointed his brother-in-law [[He Jin]], the Intendant of Henan (河南尹), as General-in-Chief (大將軍) and ordered him to supervise the imperial armies to suppress the rebellion.&lt;ref name="He Jin"&gt;(三月戊申，以河南尹何進為大將軍，將兵屯都亭。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Emperor Ling also appointed three generals – [[Lu Zhi (Han dynasty)|Lu Zhi]], [[Huangfu Song]] and [[Zhu Jun (Han dynasty)|Zhu Jun]] – to lead three separate armies to deal with the rebels. Lu Zhi went for Zhang Jue's base in Ji Province, while Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun headed to Yingchuan Commandery.&lt;ref name="HHS 8 Lu Zhi, Huangfu Song, Zhu Jun"&gt;(遣北中郎將盧植討張角，左中郎將皇甫嵩、右中郎將朱雋討潁川黃巾。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; They had a total of about 40,000 troops.&lt;ref name="HHS 71 Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun"&gt;(於是發天下精兵，博選將帥，以嵩為左中郎將，持節，與右中郎將朱雋，共發五校、三河騎士及募精勇，合四萬餘人，嵩、雋各統一軍，共討潁川黃巾。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===You Province: Guangyang and Zhuo commanderies===
In [[You Province]], the rebels killed Guo Xun (郭勳), the provincial Inspector, and Liu Wei (劉衛), the Administrator of Guangyang Commandery (廣陽郡; around present-day Beijing).&lt;ref name="Guo Xun and Liu Wei"&gt;(廣陽黃巾殺幽州刺史郭勳及太守劉衛。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zou Jing]], a colonel, led imperial forces to eliminate the rebels in You Province. [[Liu Bei]] led a group of volunteers{{efn|[[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]]'s biographies in the ''Sanguozhi'' did not mention their involvement in the Yellow Turban Rebellion, but it seems reasonable to assume they were, since they joined Liu Bei rather early.}} to assist him.&lt;ref name="Zou Jing, Liu Bei"&gt;(靈帝末，黃巾起，州郡各舉義兵，先主率其屬從校尉鄒靖討黃巾賊有功，除安喜尉。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yu Province: Runan and Yingchuan commanderies===
When the rebellion first broke out in [[Yuzhou (ancient China)|Yu Province]], the Han imperial court specially selected [[Wang Yun (Han dynasty)|Wang Yun]] to be the inspector of the province to oversee the military operations.&lt;ref name="HHS 66 Wang Yun"&gt;(中平元年，黃巾賊起，特選拜豫州刺史。 ... 討擊黃巾別帥，大破之，與左中郎將皇甫嵩、右中郎將朱雋等受降數十萬。於賊中得中常侍張讓賓客書疏，與黃巾交通，允具發其姦，以狀聞。靈帝責怒讓，讓叩頭陳謝，竟不能罪之。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhao Qian (趙謙), the administrator of Runan Commandery (汝南郡; around present-day [[Xinyang]], [[Henan]]), led his troops to attack the rebels before [[Zhu Jun (Han dynasty)|Zhu Jun]] arrived, but was defeated at Shaoling (邵陵; in present-day southeastern Henan).&lt;ref name="HHS 8 Zhao Qian"&gt;(汝南黃巾敗太守趙謙於邵陵。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; When Chen County (陳縣; present-day [[Huaiyang County]], Henan) was under attack by the rebels, seven of Zhao Qian's subordinates, who were non-military personnel, armed themselves with swords and attempted to fight the rebels but were all killed. Later, after the rebellion was suppressed, [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]] issued an edict to honour the seven as the "Seven Virtuous" (七賢).&lt;ref name="Seven Virtuous"&gt;(忠子祕，為郡門下議生。黃巾起，祕從太守趙謙擊之，軍敗，祕與功曹封觀等七人以身扞刃，皆死於陳，謙以得免。詔祕等門閭號曰「七賢」。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Xie Cheng, 'Seven Virtuous'"&gt;(謝承書曰「秘字永寧。封觀與主簿陳端、門下督范仲禮、賊曹劉偉德、主記史丁子嗣、記室史張仲然、議生袁秘等七人擢刃突陳，與戰並死」也。) Annotation from Xie Cheng's ''Houhanshu'' in (Fan Ye's) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chen State (陳國; around present-day [[Zhoukou]], Henan), one of the commanderies in Yu Province and the princedom of [[Liu Chong (Han dynasty)|Liu Chong]] (劉寵), was rather peaceful during the rebellion. This was because the rebels feared Liu Chong, who was famous for his prowess in archery, and an elite archer unit under his command.&lt;ref name="HHS 76 Liu Chong"&gt;(中平中，黃巾賊起，郡縣皆棄城走，寵有彊弩數千張，出軍都亭。國人素聞王善射，不敢反叛，故陳獨得完，百姓歸之者眾十餘萬人。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebels in Runan Commandery, led by Bo Cai (波才), initially defeated Zhu Jun in battle and drove him back. The imperial court then sent [[Cao Cao]], a cavalry commandant, to lead reinforcements to assist Zhu Jun.&lt;ref name="HHS 71 Cao Cao"&gt;(會帝遣騎都尉曹操將兵適至，嵩、操與朱雋合兵更戰，大破之，斬首數萬級。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime between 28 May and 25 June, Zhu Jun, [[Huangfu Song]] and Cao Cao joined forces and defeated Bo Cai at Changshe (長社; east of present-day [[Changge]], Henan).&lt;ref&gt;(朱雋為黃巾波才所敗。 ... 五月，皇甫嵩、朱雋復與波才等戰於長社，大破之。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HHS 71 Huangfu Song vs Bo Cai"&gt;(雋前與賊波才戰，戰敗，嵩因進保長社。波才引大眾圍城，嵩兵少，軍人皆恐，乃召軍吏謂曰：「兵有奇變，不在眾寡。今賊依草結營，易為風火。若因夜縱燒，必大驚亂。吾出兵擊之，四面俱合，田單之功可成也。」其夕遂大風，嵩乃約敕軍士皆束苣乘城，使銳士閒出圍外，縱火大呼，城上舉燎應之，嵩因鼓而奔其陳，賊驚亂奔走。 ... ) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; While Bo Cai attempted to flee, Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun pursued him to Yangzhai County (陽翟縣; present-day [[Yuzhou, Henan]]) and defeated him again there, causing the rebels to scatter.&lt;ref name="Bo Cai and Peng Tuo"/&gt;

Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun then defeated the rebels in Runan Commandery, led by Peng Tuo (彭脫), at Xihua County (西華縣; south of present-day [[Xihua County]], Henan).&lt;ref name="Bo Cai and Peng Tuo"&gt;(嵩、雋乘勝進討汝南、陳國黃巾，追波才於陽翟，擊彭脫於西華，並破之。餘賊降散，三郡悉平。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; The imperial court then ordered them to split up: Huangfu Song would attack the rebels at Dong Commandery (東郡; around present-day [[Puyang County]], Henan), while Zhu Jun would attack the rebels at Nanyang Commandery (南陽郡; around present-day [[Nanyang, Henan]]).&lt;ref name="HHS 8 Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun"&gt;(皇甫嵩、朱雋大破汝南黃巾於西華。詔嵩討東郡，朱雋討南陽。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, [[Wang Yun (Han dynasty)|Wang Yun]], the Inspector of [[Yuzhou (ancient China)|Yu Province]], found evidence that the rebels had been secretly maintaining contact with Zhang Rang (張讓), the leader of the [[Ten Attendants|eunuch faction]] in Luoyang, so he reported it to Emperor Ling, who scolded Zhang Rang but did not punish him.&lt;ref name="HHS 66 Wang Yun" /&gt;

Between 7 November and 6 December, Bao Hong (鮑鴻), a colonel, led imperial forces to attack the rebels in Gebei (葛陂; northwest of present-day [[Xincai County]], Henan) and defeated them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;([中平五年]冬十月， ... 徐黃巾復起，寇郡縣。 ... 遣下軍校尉鮑鴻討葛陂黃巾。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ji Province: Wei and Julu commanderies===
In the meantime, [[Lu Zhi (Han dynasty)|Lu Zhi]] defeated Zhang Jue's rebel forces in Julu Commandery (鉅鹿郡; around present-day [[Pingxiang County]], [[Hebei]]) and besieged the rebel leader in Guangzong County (廣宗縣; southeast of present-day [[Guangzong County]], Hebei). However, after a eunuch falsely accused him of treason, [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]] ordered Lu Zhi to be removed from his command and escorted back to [[Luoyang]] as a prisoner.&lt;ref name="Lu Zhi"&gt;(盧植破黃巾，圍張角於廣宗。宦官誣奏植，抵罪。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The imperial court then ordered the general [[Dong Zhuo]] to take over Lu Zhi's position and attack Zhang Jue. However, Dong Zhuo failed and retreated.&lt;ref name="HHS 8 Dong Zhuo"&gt;(遣中郎將董卓攻張角，不剋。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HHS 71 Dong Zhuo"&gt;(時北中郎將盧植及東中郎將董卓討張角，並無功而還，乃詔嵩進兵討之。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang Jue died of illness while under attack by Huangfu Song in Guangzong County. Between 21 November and 20 December, Huangfu Song kept attacking Zhang Liang, who had taken over command of his brother's followers at Guangzong County, but could not overcome the rebels because Zhang Liang probably had the best fighters among the Yellow Turbans with him. Huangfu Song then switched to a defensive approach to trick the rebels into lowering their guard, which they did. He then seized the opportunity to strike back at night and inflicted a devastating defeat on the rebels. Zhang Liang was killed in action along with some 30,000 rebels, while another 50,000 rebels who attempted to flee across the river ended up drowning. Huangfu Song also burnt over 30,000 carts containing supplies for the rebels and captured most of their family members.&lt;ref&gt;(嵩與角弟梁戰於廣宗。梁眾精勇，嵩不能剋。明日，乃閉營休士，以觀其變。知賊意稍懈，乃潛夜勒兵，雞鳴馳赴其陳，戰至晡時，大破之，斬梁，獲首三萬級，赴河死者五萬許人，焚燒車重三萬餘兩，悉虜其婦子，繫獲甚眾。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Huangfu Song then had Zhang Jue's body excavated and decapitated, and sent his head to the imperial court in Luoyang.&lt;ref&gt;(角先已病死，乃剖棺戮屍，傳首京師。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of Huangfu Song's achievements, Emperor Ling promoted him to Left General of Chariots and Cavalry (左車騎將軍). Between 21 December 184 and 18 January 185, Huangfu Song joined forces with Guo Dian (郭典), the Administrator of Julu Commandery, to attack the remaining rebels led by Zhang Jue's other brother, Zhang Bao. They defeated the rebels at Xiaquyang County (下曲陽縣; west of present-day [[Jinzhou, Hebei]]), killed Zhang Bao and received the surrender of over 100,000 rebels.&lt;ref name="HHS 8, 10-11th months"&gt;(冬十月，皇甫嵩與黃巾賊戰於廣宗，獲張角弟梁。角先死，乃戮其屍。以皇甫嵩為左車騎將軍。十一月，皇甫嵩又破黃巾于下曲陽，斬張角弟寶。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HHS 71 Zhang Bao, Xiaquyang County"&gt;(嵩復與鉅鹿太守馮翊郭典攻角弟寶於下曲陽，又斬之。首獲十餘萬人，築京觀於城南。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jing Province: Nanyang Commandery===
On 24 March 184, the rebels led by Zhang Mancheng (張曼成) killed Chu Gong (褚貢), the Administrator of Nanyang Commandery (南陽郡; around present-day [[Nanyang, Henan]]), and occupied the commandery's capital, Wancheng (宛城; present-day [[Wancheng District]], Nanyang, Henan).&lt;ref name="Zhang Mancheng killed Chu Gong"&gt;(庚子，南陽黃巾張曼成攻殺郡守褚貢。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Chu Gong's successor, Qin Jie (秦頡), rallied local forces in Nanyang Commandery to attack Zhang Mancheng and defeated and killed him between 26 June and 25 July,&lt;ref name="Qin Jie defeated Zhang Mancheng"&gt;(六月，南陽太守秦頡擊張曼成，斬之。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HHS 71 Zhu Jun"&gt;(時南陽黃巾張曼成起兵，稱「神上使」，眾數萬，殺郡守褚貢，屯宛下百餘日。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; before reinforcements led by [[Zhu Jun (Han dynasty)|Zhu Jun]] showed up.

After Zhang Mancheng's death, Zhao Hong (趙弘) became the new rebel leader in Wancheng. Around October 184 or after, Qin Jie and Zhu Jun combined forces with Xu Qiu (徐璆), the Inspector of [[Jing Province]], to attack Wancheng with an army of about 18,000. They defeated and killed Zhao Hong.&lt;ref name="Zhao Hong, Zhu Jun, Xu Qiu, Qin Jie"&gt;(後太守秦頡擊殺曼成，賊更以趙弘為帥，眾浸盛，遂十餘萬，據宛城。雋與荊州刺史徐璆及秦頡合兵萬八千人圍弘，自六月至八月不拔。有司奏欲徵雋。 ... 雋因急擊弘，斬之。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Zhao Hong's death, Han Zhong (韓忠) and the remaining rebels seized control of Wancheng and continued to resist imperial forces. Zhu Jun ordered his troops to pretend to attack from the southwest, while he secretly led 5,000 elite soldiers to infiltrate Wancheng from the northeast. Han Zhong retreated into the citadel and wanted to surrender. Qin Jie, Xu Qiu and Zhang Chao (張超), a Major under Zhu Jun, all urged Zhu Jun to accept Han Zhong's surrender but he refused. Later, Zhu Jun pretended to lift the siege to lure Han Zhong to come out and attack. Han Zhong fell for the ruse, lost the battle and tried to flee north while some 10,000 of his men were slaughtered by imperial forces. In desperation, Han Zhong surrendered to Zhu Jun, but Qin Jie, who hated him, had him executed.&lt;ref name="Han Zhong, Zhu Jun, Zhang Chao, Xu Qiu, Qin Jie"&gt;(賊餘帥韓忠復據宛拒雋。雋兵少不敵，乃張圍結壘，起土山以臨城內，因鳴鼓攻其西南，賊悉眾赴之。雋自將精卒五千，掩其東北，乘城而入。忠乃退保小城，惶懼乞降。司馬張超及徐璆、秦頡皆欲聽之。 ... 因急攻，連戰不剋。雋登土山望之， ... 既而解圍，忠果出戰，雋因擊，大破之。乘勝逐北數十里，斬首萬餘級。忠等遂降。而秦頡積忿忠，遂殺之。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 January 185, Zhu Jun defeated another rebel force led by Sun Xia (孫夏), who then fled towards Xi'e County (西鄂縣; north of present-day [[Nanyang, Henan]]). Zhu Jun pursued him there, defeated him and caused the remaining rebels to disperse.&lt;ref name="Zhu Jun killed Sun Xia"&gt;(癸巳，朱雋拔宛城，斬黃巾別帥孫夏。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun Xia fled to Xi'e"&gt;(餘眾懼不自安，復以孫夏為帥，還屯宛中。雋急攻之。夏走，追至西鄂精山，又破之。復斬萬餘級，賊遂解散。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Xu and Yang provinces===
In [[Xu Province]], the provincial Inspector [[Tao Qian (Han dynasty)|Tao Qian]], with the aid of [[Zang Ba]] and others, managed to defeat the rebels and restore peace in the region.&lt;ref name="HHS 73 Tao Qian"&gt;(會徐州黃巾起，以謙為徐州刺史，擊黃巾，大破走之，境內晏然。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SGZ 18 Zang Ba"&gt;(黃巾起，霸從陶謙擊破之，拜騎都尉。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sun Jian]], then a minor official serving in Xiapi County (下邳縣; south of present-day [[Pizhou]], [[Jiangsu]]) in Xu Province, came to join Zhu Jun's army as a Major. He brought along with him several young men from Xiapi County and other soldiers he recruited from the [[Huai River]] region.&lt;ref name="SGZ 46 Sun Jian"&gt;(中平元年，黃巾賊帥張角起於魏郡，託有神靈，遣八使以善道教化天下，而潛相連結，自稱黃天泰平。三月甲子，三十六萬一旦俱發，天下響應，燔燒郡縣，殺害長吏。漢遣車騎將軍皇甫嵩、中郎將朱儁將兵討擊之。儁表請堅為佐軍司馬，鄉里少年隨在下邳者皆願從。堅又募諸商旅及淮、泗精兵，合千許人，與儁并力奮擊，所向無前。汝、潁賊困迫，走保宛城。堅身當一面，登城先入，衆乃蟻附，遂大破之。儁具以狀聞上，拜堅別部司馬。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Yang Province]], the rebels attacked Shu County (舒縣; in present-day central [[Anhui]]), a county in Lujiang Commandery (廬江郡; around present-day [[Lu'an]], Anhui), and set fire to buildings. [[Yang Xu (Xingzu)|Yang Xu]] (羊續), the Administrator of Lujiang Commandery, managed to rally thousands of able-bodied men aged 19 or above to help him in fighting the rebels and putting out the fires. He succeeded, restoring peace and stability in the region.&lt;ref name="HHS 31 Yang Xu"&gt;(... 四遷為廬江太守。後揚州黃巾賊攻舒，焚燒城郭，續發縣中男子二十以上，皆持兵勒陳，其小弱者，悉使負水灌火，會集數萬人，并埶力戰，大破之，郡界平。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of the rebellion===
By the beginning of 185, the rebellion had mostly been suppressed following Zhu Jun's recapture of Wancheng in Nanyang Commandery and Huangfu Song's victories over the Zhang brothers in Ji Province. The remaining, scattered rebels were pursued by government forces in various mopping-up operations, and in mid-February 185, Emperor Ling issued a proclamation of celebration by changing his [[Chinese era name|era name]] from Guanghe (光和) to Zhongping (中平; "pacification achieved").&lt;ref name=ANU/&gt;

==Resurgent Yellow Turban activities after early 185==
Although the Yellow Turban Rebellion ended by February 185, smaller rebellions by Yellow Turban remnants continued to break out throughout China over the following decades, even in provinces which were previously largely unaffected.

===White Wave Bandits===
Between 16 March and 13 April 188, Guo Tai (郭太) led some 100,000 Yellow Turban remnants to start a rebellion in Xihe Commandery (西河郡; around present-day [[Fenyang]], [[Shanxi]]). As they originated from Baibo Valley (白波谷; "White Wave Valley") in Xihe Commandery, they later became known as the "White Wave Bandits" (白波賊). They allied with the [[Xiongnu]] leader [[Chizhishizhuhou Chanyu|Yufuluo]] and attacked Taiyuan Commandery (太原郡; around present-day [[Taiyuan]], [[Shanxi]]) and Hedong Commandery (河東郡; around present-day [[Yuncheng, Shanxi]]).&lt;ref name="HHS 8 Guo Tai"&gt;([中平五年二月， ...]黃巾餘賊郭太等起於西河白波谷，寇太原、河東。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(魏書曰：於夫羅者，南單于子也。中平中，發匈奴兵，於夫羅率以助漢。會本國反，殺南單于，於夫羅遂將其衆留中國。因天下撓亂，與西河白波賊合，破太原、河內，抄略諸郡為寇。) ''Wei Shu'' annotation in ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 27 October and 25 November 189, when the bandits attacked Hedong Commandery, the warlord [[Dong Zhuo]] sent his son-in-law [[Niu Fu]] to lead troops to attack them, but Niu Fu failed to defeat them.&lt;ref&gt;(白波賊寇河東，董卓遣其將牛輔擊之。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(初，靈帝末，黃巾餘黨郭太等復起西河白波谷，轉寇太原，遂破河東，百姓流轉三輔，號為「白波賊」，眾十餘萬。卓遣中郎將牛輔擊之，不能卻。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around mid-195, [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] fled from the imperial capital [[Chang'an]], where he had been held hostage by Dong Zhuo's followers, led by [[Li Jue (Han dynasty)|Li Jue]] and [[Guo Si]], since Dong Zhuo's death in 192. He returned to the ruins of the old imperial capital [[Luoyang]], which Dong Zhuo burnt down in 191 while forcefully relocating its residents to Chang'an. [[Dong Cheng (Han dynasty)|Dong Cheng]] (a former subordinate of Niu Fu) and [[Yang Feng]] (a former White Wave bandit)&lt;ref name="HHS 72 Yang Feng"&gt;(傕將楊奉本白波賊帥， ...) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; protected Emperor Xian in Luoyang when Li Jue and Guo Si tried to pursue and bring the emperor back to Chang'an. Dong Cheng and Yang Feng summoned the White Wave Bandits, led by Li Le (李樂), [[Han Xian (Han dynasty)|Han Xian]], Hu Cai (胡才) and others, to come to Emperor Xian's aid. Xiongnu forces led by Qubei (去卑) also responded to the call and came to help Emperor Xian resist Li Jue and Guo Si's forces.&lt;ref name="HHS 72 White Wave Bandits"&gt;(李傕、郭汜既悔令天子東，乃來救段煨，因欲劫帝而西， ... 而張濟與楊奉、董承不相平，乃反合傕、汜，共追乘輿，大戰於弘農東澗。承、奉軍敗，百官士卒死者不可勝數，皆棄其婦女輜重，御物符策典籍，略無所遺。 ... 天子遂露次曹陽。承、奉乃譎傕等與連和，而密遣閒使至河東，招故白波帥李樂、韓暹、胡才及南匈奴右賢王去卑，並率其眾數千騎來，與承、奉共擊傕等，大破之，斬首數千級，乘輿乃得進。董承、李樂擁衛左右，胡才、楊奉、韓暹、去卑為後距。傕等復來戰，奉等大敗，死者甚於東澗。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 195 and 196, the warlord [[Cao Cao]] led his forces into Luoyang and escorted Emperor Xian to his own base in Xu (許; present-day [[Xuchang]], [[Henan]]) and established the new imperial capital there.

===Yi Province: Ma Xiang and Zhao Zhi===
Between 12 July and 10 August 185, Ma Xiang (馬相) and Zhao Zhi (趙祗) led Yellow Turban remnants to start a rebellion in [[Yi Province]] (covering present-day [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]]). They killed Li Sheng (李升; Prefect of Mianzhu County 緜竹縣), Zhao Bu (趙部; Administrator of Ba Commandery 巴郡) and Xi Jian (郗儉; Inspector of Yi Province). Ma Xiang even declared himself emperor. The rebellion was suppressed by local forces led by Jia Long (賈龍), a former subordinate of Xi Jian.&lt;ref name="Ma Xiang, Xi Jian, Zhao Bu and Jia Long"&gt;([中平五年六月， ...]益州黃巾馬相攻殺刺史郗儉，自稱天子，又寇巴郡，殺郡守趙部，益州從事賈龍擊相，斬之。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ma Xiang and Zhao Zhi"&gt;(是時梁州逆賊馬相、趙祗等於緜竹縣自號黃巾，合聚疲役之民，一二日中得數千人，先殺緜竹令李升，吏民翕集合萬餘人，便前破雒縣，攻益州殺儉，又到蜀郡、犍為，旬月之間，破壞三郡。相自稱天子，衆以萬數。州從事賈龍素領兵數百人在犍為東界，攝斂吏民，得千餘人，攻相等，數日破走，州界清靜。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qing Province: Zhang Rao, Guan Hai, Xu He and Sima Ju===
Around 189, Zhang Rao (張饒) led some 200,000 Yellow Turban remnants to ravage [[Qing Province]]. He defeated imperial forces under [[Kong Rong]], the Han-appointed Chancellor of Beihai State (北海國; around present-day [[Weifang]], [[Shandong]]) in Qing Province.&lt;ref name="HHS 70 Zhang Rao"&gt;(時黃巾寇數州，而北海最為賊衝，卓乃諷三府同舉融為北海相。融到郡，收合士民，起兵講武，馳檄飛翰，引謀州郡。賊張饒等群輩二十萬眾從冀州還，融逆擊，為饒所敗，乃收散兵保朱虛縣。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Kong Rong was besieged in Duchang County (都昌縣; present-day [[Changyi, Shandong]]) by thousands of Yellow Turban rebels led by Guan Hai (管亥). [[Taishi Ci]], then a military officer under Kong Rong, managed to break out of the siege and seek help from [[Liu Bei]], who was then the Chancellor of the nearby Pingyuan State (平原國; around present-day [[Pingyuan County, Shandong]]). Liu Bei brought along 3,000 troops to attack Guan Hai and succeeded in saving Kong Rong.&lt;ref name="HHS 70 Guan Hai"&gt;(時黃巾復來侵暴，融乃出屯都昌，為賊管亥所圍。融逼急，乃遣東萊太史慈求救於平原相劉備。備驚曰：「孔北海乃復知天下有劉備邪？」即遣兵三千救之，賊乃散走。) ''Houhanshu'' vol. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 200s, Xu He (徐和) and Sima Ju (司馬俱) led Yellow Turban remnants from Jinan Commandery (濟南郡; around present-day [[Zhangqiu]], [[Shandong]]) and Le'an Commandery (樂安郡; around present-day [[Zibo]], Shandong) respectively to ravage [[Qing Province]]. They were defeated and killed by [[Xiahou Yuan]], [[Zang Ba]] and [[Lü Qian]] sometime between 206 and 209.{{efn|It is not known exactly when Xu He and Sima Ju were defeated and killed.

===Yan Province: Cao Cao's Qingzhou Army===
Around May 192, some hundreds of thousands of Yellow Turban remnants from [[Qing Province]] swarmed into [[Yan Province]] and killed Zheng Sui (鄭遂), the Chancellor of Rencheng State (任城國; around present-day [[Zoucheng]], [[Shandong]]), before moving into Dongping Commandery (東平郡; around present-day [[Dongping County]], Shandong). [[Liu Dai]], the Inspector of Yan Province, wanted to lead his troops to attack the rebels but the general [[Bao Xin]] advised him against it. Liu Dai ignored Bao Xin's advice, attacked the rebels, and met his end. Bao Xin and another official, Wan Qian (萬潛), went to Dong Commandery (東郡; around present-day [[Puyang]], [[Henan]]) to invite [[Cao Cao]] to be the new Governor of Yan Province. Bao Xin then led government forces to attack the rebels at the east of Shouzhang County (壽張縣; south of present-day Dongping County, Shandong) but was killed in action.&lt;ref&gt;([初平三年夏四月]青州黃巾衆百萬入兖州，殺任城相鄭遂，轉入東平。劉岱欲擊之，鮑信諫曰：「今賊衆百萬，百姓皆震恐，士卒無鬬志，不可敵也。觀賊衆羣輩相隨，軍無輜重，唯以鈔略為資，今不若畜士衆之力，先為固守。彼欲戰不得，攻又不能，其勢必離散，後選精銳，據其要害，擊之可破也。」岱不從，遂與戰，果為所殺。信乃與州吏萬潛等至東郡迎太祖領兖州牧。遂進兵擊黃巾於壽張東。信力戰鬬死，僅而破之。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, despite having fewer troops, Cao Cao managed to defeat the rebels in Jibei State (濟北國; around present-day [[Feicheng]], Shandong). The rebels, numbering over 300,000, surrendered to Cao Cao along with their families. Cao Cao then recruited their best warriors and organised them to form an elite military unit, the Qingzhou{{efn|Qingzhou refers to [[Qing Province]], where the rebels came from.}} Army (青州兵; also translated as "Qingzhou Corps").&lt;ref&gt;(魏書曰：太祖將步騎千餘人，行視戰地，卒抵賊營，戰不利，死者數百人，引還。賊尋前進。黃巾為賊久，數乘勝，兵皆精悍。太祖舊兵少，新兵不習練，舉軍皆懼。太祖被甲嬰冑，親巡將士，明勸賞罰，衆乃復奮，承間討擊，賊稍折退。賊乃移書太祖曰：「昔在濟南，毀壞神壇，其道乃與中黃太一同，似若知道，今更迷惑。漢行已盡，黃家當立。天之大運，非君才力所能存也。」太祖見檄書，呵之罪，數開示降路；遂設奇伏，晝夜會戰，戰輙禽獲，賊乃退走。) ''Wei Shu'' annotation in ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(追黃巾至濟北。乞降。冬，受降卒三十餘萬，男女百餘萬口，收其精銳者，號為青州兵。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Runan and Yingchuan commanderies: He Yi, Liu Pi, Gong Du and others===
In Runan Commandery (汝南郡; around present-day [[Xinyang]], [[Henan]]) and Yingchuan Commandery (潁川郡; around present-day [[Xuchang]], Henan), thousands of Yellow Turban remnants remained active under the leadership of He Yi (何儀), Liu Pi (劉辟), Huang Shao (黃邵), He Man (何曼) and others. They were initially allied with the warlords [[Yuan Shu]] and [[Sun Jian]], but became an independent force in the 190s. Between 17 March and 15 April 196, the warlord [[Cao Cao]] led his forces to attack them and killed Liu Pi, Huang Shao and He Man. He Yi and the others surrendered to Cao Cao.&lt;ref name="He Yi, Liu Pi, Huang Shao, He Man"&gt;(汝南、潁川黃巾何儀、劉辟、黃邵、何曼等，衆各數萬，初應袁術，又附孫堅。[建安元年]二月，太祖進軍討破之，斬辟、邵等，儀及其衆皆降。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were other Yellow Turban remnant forces led by Gong Du (共都/龔都) and Wu Ba (吳霸) in Runan Commandery. Wu Ba was defeated and captured by the general [[Li Tong (Wenda)|Li Tong]].&lt;ref name="SGZ 18 Wu Ba"&gt;又生禽黃巾大帥吳霸而降其屬。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Gong Du posed a threat to Cao Cao when he allied with Cao Cao's rival, [[Liu Bei]], and seized control of Runan Commandery in 201. Cao Cao first sent Cai Yang (蔡揚) to eliminate them, but after Cai Yang was killed, he personally led his troops to attack them and defeated them. Liu Bei fled south to join [[Liu Biao]], while Gong Du and the remaining rebels dispersed.&lt;ref name="Gong Du"&gt;([建安六年]九月，公還許。紹之未破也，使劉備略汝南，汝南賊共都等應之。遣蔡揚擊都，不利，為都所破。公南征備。備聞公自行，走奔劉表，都等皆散。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yang and Jiao provinces===
Another Yellow Turban remnant force led by Wu Huan (吳桓) was active in [[Kuaiji Commandery]] (會稽郡; around present-day [[Shaoxing]], [[Zhejiang]]) until [[Liu Zan]] defeated and killed Wu Huan.&lt;ref name="Liu Zan and Wu Huan"&gt;(吳書曰：留贊字正明，會稽長山人。少為郡吏，與黃巾賊帥吳桓戰，手斬得桓。贊一足被創，遂屈不伸。) ''Wu Shu'' annotation in ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 200s, Chen Bai (陳敗) and Wan Cheng (萬秉) started a rebellion in Jiuzhen Commandery (九真郡; present-day [[Thanh Hóa Province]], [[Vietnam]]) in [[Jiao Province]]. In 202, they were defeated and captured by [[Zhu Zhi]], the commandery's Administrator.&lt;ref name="Zhu Zhi, Chen Bai, Wan Cheng"&gt;(建安七年，權表治為九真太守，行扶義將軍，割婁、由拳、無錫、毗陵為奉邑，置長吏。征討夷越，佐定東南，禽截黃巾餘類陳敗、萬秉等。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and impact==
The Han armies gained victory at high cost. Over wide areas, government offices had been destroyed, officials had been killed, and whole districts were cut off from the writ of the central government. Rebel deaths numbered in the hundreds of thousands, while many non-combatants had been left homeless or destitute by the wars, and the economy and society over great parts of this most populous region of the empire were left in ruins and without resources. Unrest remained and bandits appeared in every district; the Han government, in no position to put down all the lesser disturbances, was forced to patch up the situation as best it could. A long period of consolidation was needed to restore some measure of peace and prosperity, but that breathing space was not given.&lt;ref name=ANU/&gt;

While the rebellion was eventually defeated, the military leaders and local administrators gained self-governing powers in the process. This hastened the collapse of the Han dynasty in 220. After [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]] died in 189, a power struggle between [[He Jin]] and the eunuchs ensued in which He Jin was assassinated on 22 September 189. He Jin's chief ally, [[Yuan Shao]], retaliated by setting the palace on fire and slaughtering the eunuchs. Finally, the warlord [[Dong Zhuo]] was able to gain control over the underage heir to the throne which he used as a legitimation for occupying the capital, which was ransacked on the occasion. Because of his cruelty, Dong Zhuo was murdered in 192, setting the stage for [[Cao Cao]]'s rise to power.

Despite the negative manner in which the 14th-century historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' describes the Yellow Turban Rebellion, many subsequent peasant uprisings in China drew inspiration from the Yellow Turban Rebellion and even claimed to be its spiritual successors.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==In ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms''==

The rebellion is portrayed in the opening chapters of the 14th-century historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', which portrays the Zhang brothers as sorcerers, having been provided the ''[[Taiping Jing]]'' from the "[[Xian (Taoism)|old immortal spirit from the southern lands]]" (sometimes identified as [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]]).&lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;{{cite book |first=Moss |last=Roberts | title=Three Kingdoms: A Historical Novel | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Three_kingdoms.html?id=Sc-shy_ZOMkC | publisher=[[University of California Press]] | location=[[California]] | year=1991 | isbn=0-520-22503-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fictional Yellow Turban figures were created for the novel, including:
* [[Du Yuan]], killed by [[Liao Hua]] for kidnapping [[Liu Bei]]'s wives.
* [[Zhou Cang]], [[Guan Yu]]'s rebel-turned-weapon bearer.
* [[Gao Sheng (rebel)|Gao Sheng]], a subordinate of Zhang Bao.
* [[Cheng Yuanzhi]], defeated by Liu Bei's forces in their first engagement.
* [[Deng Mao]], Cheng Yuanzhi's champion.
* [[Bian Xi]], an eventual servant of [[Cao Cao]] who tried and failed to kill Guan Yu.

Though not a fictional character, [[Liao Hua]] was presented in the novel as having been a Yellow Turban rebel in his earlier days; this is historically unlikely, given his date of death and predicted lifespan.

==In popular culture==
The rebellion also appears as an early stage in each iteration of [[Koei]]'s [[Dynasty Warriors|''Dynasty Warriors'' video game franchise]], remaining largely unchanged throughout the series.
