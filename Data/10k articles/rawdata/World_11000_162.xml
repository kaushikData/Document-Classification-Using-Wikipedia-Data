Significant numbers of Achomi people have migrated to Kuwait, Bahrain, UAE and other [[Persian Gulf]] Arab countries in the region.

The [[Irahistan|historical region of Irahistan]] consists of several counties in [[Fars Province]] ([[Larestan County|Larestan]], [[Khonj]], [[Gerash County|Gerash]], [[Lamerd County|Lamerd]]) and [[Bastak County]] in [[Hormozgan Province|Hormozgan]]{{cn|date=June 2018}}. In Bahrain, Sunni Bahrainis of Achomi ancestry are known as [[Hola (ethnic group)|Hola]].

Achomi people speak the [[Achomi language]]. The language is in decline and has reported eight dialects and it is not understood by mainstream Farsi speakers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290821138_A_Study_of_Personal_Pronouns_of_Larestani_Language_as_an_Endangered_Iranian_Language}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Ahmad Iqtidari noted in his book Ancient Larestan (1955): 
 
"To those people of the towns, villages, and ports of Larestan who have stayed in the land of their ancestors, with its glorious past and its desolate present.  And to those who have endured the hardship of migration to earn a living on the islands of the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean and in the towns of India, Arabia and other places.  They remember with joy their beloved birthplace and still grieve for its ruin." 

Achomi people refer to themselves as ''Khodmooni'', a term literally meaning "part of ourselves"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but figuratively used to refer to people from the historical region of Larestan but not city of Lar itself.

[[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] has had a legendary image in the [[Western world]] through the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew]] traditions. Egypt was already ancient to outsiders, and the idea of Egypt has continued to be at least as influential in the [[history of ideas]] as the actual historical Egypt itself.&lt;ref&gt;Janetta Rebold Benton and"Ancient Egypt in the European imagination" p. 54ff. Robert DiYanni, ''Arts and Culture: an introduction to the humanities'', 1999: "Ancient Egypt in the European imagination", pp 54ff.&lt;/ref&gt; All Egyptian culture was transmitted to Roman and post-Roman European culture through the lens of [[Hellenistic]] conceptions of it, until the decipherment of [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]] by [[Jean-François Champollion]] in the 1820s rendered Egyptian texts legible, finally enabling an understanding of Egypt as the Egyptians themselves understood it.

After [[Late Antiquity]], the [[Old Testament]] image of Egypt as the land of enslavement for the [[Hebrews]] predominated, and "[[Pharaoh]]" became a synonym for despotism and oppression in the 19th century. However, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking and [[colonialism|colonialist]] explorations in the late 18th century renewed interest in ancient Egypt as both a model for, and an exotic alternative to, [[Western culture]], particularly as a Romantic source for [[Classical architecture|classicizing architecture]].

==Antiquity==
===Classical texts===
[[Herodotus]], in his ''[[The Histories of Herodotus|Histories]]'', Book II, gives a detailed if selectively coloured and imaginative description of ancient Egypt. He praises peasants' preservation of history through oral tradition, and Egyptians' piety. He lists the many animals to which Egypt is home, including the mythical [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] and [[Feathered Serpent|winged serpent]], and gives inaccurate descriptions of the [[hippopotamus]] and [[Cerastes cerastes|horned viper]]. Herodotus was quite critical about the stories he heard from the priests (II,123), but [[Diodorus Siculus]], who visited Hellenistic Egypt in the 1st century BCE, gave credit to what he was told by priests: that many famous Greek philosophers had studied in Egypt. Both Plutarch and [[Diogenes Laertius]] (3rd century) mention that [[Thales]] studied in Egypt, while nothing is really known about Thales from his own time. [[Iamblichus of Chalcis]] in the 3rd century CE reports that Pythagoras studied in Egypt for 22 years.

From the classical texts that thus evolved, a mythical Egypt emerges as the mother-country of Religion, Wisdom, Philosophy, and Science.

Among the Romans, an Egypt that had been drawn into the Roman economic and political sphere was still a source of wonders: ''[[List of Latin phrases: E#ex Africa semper aliquid novi|Ex Africa semper aliquid novi]]'';&lt;ref&gt;An overview is M. J. Versluys, ''Aegyptiaca Romana: nilotic scenes and the Roman views of Egypt'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; the exotic fauna of the [[Nile]] is embodied in the famous [[Nile mosaic of Palestrina|"Nilotic" mosaic from Praeneste]], and Romanized iconographies were developed for the "Alexandrian Triad",  [[Isis]], who developed a widespread Roman following, [[Harpocrates]], "god of silence", and the Ptolemaic [[syncretism]] of [[Serapis]].&lt;ref&gt;Isis:
Laurent Bricault, M. J. Versluys, P. G. P. Meyboom, eds. ''Nile into Tiber: Egypt in the Roman world: proceedings of the IIIrd International Conference of Isis Studies'' (Leiden), May 11–14, 2005; Harpocrates: [http://www.religionswissenschaft.unizh.ch/idd/prepublications/e_idd_harpocrates.pdf Iconography of Harpocrates (PDF-article)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407082954/http://www.religionswissenschaft.unizh.ch/idd/prepublications/e_idd_harpocrates.pdf |date=April 7, 2008 }}; Serapis: Anne Roullet, ''The Egyptian and Egyptianizing monuments of imperial Rome'', 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Bible===
Egypt is mentioned 611 times in the [[Bible]], between {{bibleverse||Genesis|12:10|KJV}} and {{bibleverse||Revelation|11:8|KJV}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Strong | first =James | title =Strong's Expanded Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible | publisher =Thomas Nelson Publishers | year =2001 | location =Nashville | pages =221–222 | isbn =0-7852-4540-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Septuagint]], through which most Christians knew the Hebrew Bible, was commissioned in [[Alexandria]], it was remembered, with the embellishment that though the seventy scholars set to work upon the texts independently, miraculously each arrived at the same translation.

==Middle Ages and Renaissance==
Following the 7th-century [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]], the West lost direct contact with Egypt and its culture. In [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] Europe, Egypt was depicted primarily in the illustration and interpretation of the biblical accounts. These illustrations were often quite fanciful, as the iconography and style of ancient [[Egyptian art]], [[Egyptian architecture|architecture]] and [[costume]] were largely unknown in the West (''illustration, right''). Dramatic settings of the [[Finding of Moses]], the [[Plagues of Egypt]], the [[Parting of the Red Sea]] and the story of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] in Egypt, and from the New Testament the [[Flight into Egypt]] often figured in medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]].  Biblical [[hermeneutics]] were primarily theological in nature, and had little to do with historical investigations. Throughout the Middle Ages "[[Mummia]]", made, if it were genuine, by pounding mummified bodies, was a standard product of apothecary shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mummy |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Concise |url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9054257/mummies |accessdate=2007-06-30 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]] the  German [[Jesuit]] scholar [[Athanasius Kircher]] gave an allegorical "decipherment" of hieroglyphs through which Egypt was thought of as a source of ancient [[mysticism|mystic]] or [[occult]] wisdom. In alchemist circles, the prestige of "Egyptians" rose. A few scholars, however, remained skeptic:&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Kestler]] enumerated the contemporary critics of Kircher: "Some critics, Kestler wrote with amazement, believed that Kircher's explanation of the hieroglyphs was simply 'a figment of his own mind'" (Paula Findlen, ''Athanasius Kircher: the last man who knew everything'', 2004:38)&lt;/ref&gt; in the 16th century, [[Isaac Casaubon]] determined that the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'' of the great [[Hermes Trismegistus]] was actually a Greek work of about the 4th century CE (even though Casaubon's work was also criticized by Ralph Cudworth).

== 18th century ==
[[File:Place du Caire.jpg|thumb|''Foire du Caire'', Paris (1798), with [[Hathor]] heads and Egyptianizing frieze]]
Early in the 18th century, [[Jean Terrasson]] had written ''[[Life of Sethos]]'', a work of fiction, which launched the notion of Egyptian mysteries. In an atmosphere of antiquarian interest, a sense arose that ancient knowledge was somehow embodied in Egyptian monuments and lore.  Following the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] example, an Egyptian imagery pervaded the European [[Freemasonry]] of the time and its imagery, such as the eye on the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramid]] — still depicted on the [[Great Seal of the United States]] (1782), which appears on the [[United States one-dollar bill]] — and the Egyptian references in [[Mozart]]'s Masonic-themed ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'' (The Magic Flute, 1791), and his earlier unfinished "Thamos".{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The revival of curiosity about the Antique world, seen through written documents, spurred the publication of a collection of Greek texts that had been assembled in Late Antiquity, which were published as the corpus of works of [[Hermes Trismegistus]]. But the broken ruins that sometimes appeared in paintings of the episode of the [[Rest on the Flight into Egypt]] were always of Roman character.

With historicism came the first fictions set in the Egypt of the imagination. [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' had been set partly in Alexandria, but its protagonists were noble and universal, and Shakespeare had not been concerned to evoke local color.

== 19th century ==
[[Image:Rowlandson-modern-antiques-Egyptomania-1806.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Rowlandson|Rowlandson]]'s 1806 satire on craze for [[ancient Egypt]] after [[Napoleon]]'s invasion]]The rationale for "Egyptomania" rests on a similar concept: Westerners looked to ancient Egyptian motifs because ancient Egypt itself was intrinsically so alluring. The Egyptians used to consider their religion and their government somewhat eternal; they were supported in this thought by the enduring aspect of great public monuments which lasted forever and which appeared to resist the effects of time. Their legislators had judged that this moral impression would contribute to the stability of their empire.&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in Jacques-Joseph Champollion-Figeac, Fourier et Napoleon: l'Egypte et les cent jours: memoires et documents inedits, Paris, Firmin Didot Freres, 1844, p. 170.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The culture of [[Romanticism]] embraced every exotic locale, and its rise in the popular imagination coincided with [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]'s failed Egyptian campaign and the start of modern [[Egyptology]], beginning very much as a competitive enterprise between Britain and France.  A modern "[[Battle of the Nile]]" could hardly fail to stir renewed curiosity about Egypt beyond the figure of [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]].  At about the same moment, the [[tarot]] was brought to Europe's attention by the Frenchman [[Antoine Court de Gebelin]] as a purported key to the [[occult]] knowledge of Egypt. All this gave rise to "[[Egyptomania]]" and [[occult tarot]].

This legendary Egypt has been difficult, but not impossible to concile with the 1824 [[decryption]] of hieroglyphs by [[Jean-François Champollion]]. Inscriptions that a century earlier had been thought to hold occult wisdom, proved to be nothing more than royal names and titles, funerary formulae, boastful accounts of military campaigns, even though there remains an obscure part that might agree with the mystic vision. The explosion of new knowledge about actual Egyptian religion, wisdom and philosophy has been widely interpreted as exposing the mythical image of Egypt as an illusion that had been created by the Greek and Western imaginations.

In art the development of [[Orientalism]], and the increased possibility of travel produced a large number of depictions, of varying degrees of accuracy.  By the late 19th-century exotic and carefully studied or researched decor was often dominant in depictions of both landscape and human figures, whether ancient or modern.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Jason, ''Wonderful Things: A History of Egyptology 1: From Antiquity to 1881'', 255, 2015, The American University in Cairo Press, {{ISBN|9774165993}}, 9789774165993, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rd-yCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA255 google books]; Tromans, Nicholas, and others, ''The Lure of the East, British Orientalist Painting'', 2008, [[Tate Gallery|Tate Publishing]], {{ISBN|9781854377333}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
On the most popular 19th-century level, all of ancient Egypt was reduced in the European imagination to the [[Nile]], the [[Egyptian pyramids|Pyramids]] and [[Sphinx|the Great Sphinx]] in a setting of sand, characterized on a more literary level in the English poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]'s "[[Ozymandias]]" (1818):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
The lone and level sands stretch far away.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:JMartin7thPlague1828.jpg|thumb|280px|[[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]]'s ''[[Plagues of Egypt|Seventh Plague of Egypt]]'' (1828) set the Biblical plague in [[Hellenistic]] [[Alexandria]].]]
[[Image:Egyptian Avenue Highgate Cemetery.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Entrance to Egyptian Avenue, [[Highgate Cemetery]]]]
[[Egyptian Revival architecture]] extended the repertory of classical design explored by the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical movement]] and widened the decorative vocabulary that could be drawn upon.

The well-known Egyptian cult of the dead inspired the Egyptian Revival themes first employed in [[Highgate Cemetery]], near London, which was opened in 1839 by a company founded by the  designer-entrepreneur Stephen Geary (1797–1854); its architectural features, which included a 'Gothic Catacomb' as well as an  'Egyptian Avenue', were brought to public attention once more by [[James Stevens Curl]].&lt;ref&gt;James Stevens Curl, ''The Victorian Celebration of Death'', 1972, pp. 86-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Egypt provided the setting for the Italian composer [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s stately 1871 [[opera]] ''[[Aida]]'', commissioned by the Europeanized [[Khedive]] for premiere in [[Cairo]].

In 1895, the [[Poland|Polish]] writer [[Bolesław Prus]] completed his only [[historical novel]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', a study of mechanisms of [[political power]], described against the backdrop of the fall of the [[Twentieth Dynasty]] and the [[New Kingdom]]. It is, at the same time, one of the most compelling literary reconstructions of life at every level of ancient Egyptian society. In 1966, the novel was adapted as a Polish [[Pharaoh (film)|feature film]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Prus' ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'':  the Creation of a Historical Novel", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', 1994, no. 1, pp. 45-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Nefertiti 30-01-2006.jpg|thumb|''[[Nefertiti]]''. [[Nefertiti bust|Bust]] in [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin|Egyptian Museum, Berlin]].]]
In 1912, the discovery of an exquisite painted limestone [[Nefertiti bust|bust of Nefertiti]], unearthed from its sculptor's workshop near the royal city of [[Amarna]], added the first new celebrity of Egypt. The bust, now in [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin|Berlin's Egyptian Museum]], became so famous through the medium of photography that it became the most familiar, most copied work of ancient Egyptian sculpture{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}; Nefertiti's strong-featured profile was a notable influence on new ideals of feminine beauty in the 20th century.
[[Image:Tutmask.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tutankhamun]]'s mask. [[Egyptian Museum]], [[Cairo]].]]

The 1922 discovery of the undamaged tomb of Pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]] introduced a new celebrity to join [[Nefertiti]] — "King Tut".  The tomb's spectacular treasures influenced [[Art Deco|Art-Deco]] design vocabulary{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}.  Also, for many years there persisted rumors, probably [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]-inspired, of a "[[Curse of the Pharaohs|curse]]"; the rumors focused on the alleged premature deaths of some of those who had first entered the tomb. A recent study{{which|date=January 2018}} of journals and death records, however, indicates no [[statistics|statistical]] difference between the ages at death of those who had entered the tomb and of expedition members who had not; indeed, most of the individuals lived past age 70. The idea of a "mummy's curse" inspired films such as ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'', starring [[Boris Karloff]], which popularized the idea of ancient Egyptian mummies reanimating as [[monster]]s. Another literary occurrence at that time of Egypt is [[Agatha Christie]]'s 1936 [[mystery novel]] ''[[Death on the Nile]]''.

[[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]'s depection of [[ancient Egypt]] is a major contributor to the fantasy Egypt of modern culture. The cinematic spectacle of Egypt climaxed in sequences of [[Cecil B. deMille]]'s ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956) and in [[Jeanne Crain]]'s [[Nefertiti]] in the 1961 Italian [[Cinecittà]] production of ''Queen of the Nile'', and collapsed with the failure of [[Richard Burton]] and [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1963).

In 1978, Tutankhamun was commemorated in the whimsical song, "[[King Tut (song)|King Tut]]", by  American comedian [[Steve Martin]], and in 1986 the poses in some Egyptian mural art were evoked in the song "[[Walk Like an Egyptian]]" by [[The Bangles]].

The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] resurrected the [[Temple of Dendur]] within its own quarters in 1978. In 1989, [[Louvre|the Louvre]] raised its own glass pyramid, and in 1993 [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]'s [[Luxor Las Vegas|Luxor Hotel]] opened with its replica tomb of Tutankhamun.

A best-selling series of novels by French author and Egyptologist [[Christian Jacq]] was inspired by the life of Pharaoh [[Ramses II]] ("the Great").

== 21st century ==

[[HBO]]'s miniseries ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'' features several episodes set in Greco-Roman Egypt.  The faithful reconstructions of an ''ancient Egyptian'' court (as opposed to the historically correct ''Hellenistic'' culture) were built in Rome's [[Cinecittà]] studios.  The series depicts dramatized accounts of the relations among [[Cleopatra]], [[Ptolemy XIII]], [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Mark Antony]].  Cleopatra is played by [[Lyndsey Marshal]], and much of the second season is dedicated to events building up to the famous suicides of Cleopatra and her lover Mark Antony in 30 BCE.

''[[La Reine Soleil]]'', a 2007 animated film by Philippe Leclerc, features Akhenaten, Tutankhaten (later Tutankhamun), Akhesa (Ankhesenepaten, later Ankhesenamun), Nefertiti, and Horemheb in a complex struggle pitting the priests of Amun against Akhenaten's intolerant monotheism.

American singer [[Katy Perry]] released in 2013 the song ''[[Dark Horse (Katy Perry song)|Dark Horse]]'' and the plot of the music video for the song was set it [[Memphis, Egypt|ancient Memphis]]. The video features numerous ancient Egyptian symbols and many of the things featured in it are historically accurate even though no [[Egyptology|egyptologists]] were consulted during its production. The [[turquoise]] makeup worn by Katy Perry in the video would have been used in Ancient Egypt, the dress she wore is similar in style to the Graeco-Roman clothes worn by nobles such as [[Cleopatra]], the video features the [[Eye of Horus]] a powerful symbol in Ancient Egypt and the paintings behind the throne that Katy Perry sits on appear to have been made based on reall examples from Ancient Egyptian tombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rothan |first1=Lily |title=There's a Very Good Reason Why Katy Perry's "Dark Horse" Video Is Set in Ancient Egypt |url=http://time.com/9233/katy-perry-dark-horse-egypt/ |accessdate=9 September 2018 |work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' launched in 2017 ''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]'' and the plot of the game is set in Egypt during the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]]. The game follows Bayek, a [[medjay]] from the [[Siwa Oasis]] who is trying to revenge the death of his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cork |first1=Jeff |title=Meet Assassin’s Creed Origin’s New Hero – And His Eagle |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/06/11/-meet-assassin-s-creed-origin-s-new-hero-and-his-eagle.aspx |website=GameInfo |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction of Ancient Egypt in the game is really historically accurate and it offers a unique glimpse into the life of Egyptian people in 1st century AD. The buildings, landscapes, animals, even tha language people are talking in were molded based on historical sources as many [[historian]]s and [[egyptology|egyptologists]] were consulted during the making of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lowry |first1=Brendan |title=How Assassin's Creed: Origins achieved amazing historical accuracy — and why that's key |url=https://www.windowscentral.com/benefits-historical-accuracy-assassins-creed-origins |website=Windows Central |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Angola–Portugal relations''' have significantly improved since the [[Angola]]n government abandoned [[communism]] and nominally embraced [[democracy]] in 1991, embracing a pro-[[Angola-United States relations|U.S.]] and to a lesser degree pro-[[Europe]] foreign policy. [[Portugal]] ruled Angola for 400 years,&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite book|last=Alker|first=Hayward R.|author2=Ted Robert Gurr |author3=[[Kumar Rupesinghe]] |year=2001|title=Journeys Through Conflict: Narratives and Lessons|pages=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; colonizing the territory from 1483 until independence in 1975. Angola's war for [[Angolan War for Independence|independence]] did not end in a military victory for either side, but was suspended as a result of a [[Carnation Revolution|coup in Portugal]], that replaced the [[Marcelo Caetano|Caetano regime]] with a  [[National Salvation Junta]].

The Portuguese government recognized the authority of the [[MPLA]], under the command of [[President of Angola|President]] [[Agostinho Neto]], on December 22, 1976 and established diplomatic relations on March 10. The MPLA broke off relations with Portugal on May 19 but reestablished official contact on September 3 following a meeting between their Foreign Ministers in [[Cape Verde]].&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalley|first=Jacqueline A.|author2=Elna Schoeman|year=1999|title=Southern African Political History: A Chronology of Key Political Events from Independence to Mid-1997|pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNITA]] released a communiqué from [[Paris]] on November 13, 1978, detailing an anti-UNITA attack by 20,000 troops from [[Portugal]], [[Cuba]], [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], [[East Germany]], and the [[MPLA]].&lt;ref name=c&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalley|first=Jacqueline A.|author2=Elna Schoeman|year=1999|title=Southern African Political History: A Chronology of Key Political Events from Independence to Mid-1997|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 17, 2011, the Portuguese government of [[Pedro Passos Coelho]] finalized a loan from the Angolan government of [[José Eduardo dos Santos]] to help Portugal deal with its [[2010–14 Portuguese financial crisis|2010–14 financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/03/portugal-economy-bailout-angola-invests Portugal indebted to Angola after economic reversal of fortune]&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal remains one of Angola's largest trading partners. In 2015, Portuguese exports to Angola amounted to US$2.45 billion and Angolan exports to Portugal totaled US$1.19 billion.&lt;ref&gt;https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/AGO/Year/LTST/Summary&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artel of Artists''' ({{Lang-ru|«Арте́ль худо́жников»}}) was a [[cooperative]] association (''[[artel]]'') and a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] of democratically-minded artists headed by [[Ivan Kramskoi]]. It was established in 1863 after some of its future organisers had been expelled from the [[Imperial Academy of Arts|St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg Academy of Arts]] because of the "revolt of fourteen".  In rebellion against the Academy's annual competition, the students refused to paint an exam picture on the given topic.

A number of members of the Artel later became ''[[Peredvizhniki|Peredvizhniks]]''.

'''''Baby''''' is a 1973 novel by [[Denmark|Danish]] author [[Kirsten Thorup]]. It deals with the disadvantaged members of society, those who have failed to make a mark.

The novel traces the movements of a selection of losers as they leave a cheap [[Copenhagen]] nightclub. There is Mark, a car salesman heavily in debt who ultimately separates from his pretty wife, Suzie who goes off to Sweden on a drunken escape, Leni who translates porno rather than the book she would like to complete, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsu.edu/lsupress/bookPages/9780807125182.html Baby by Kirsten Thorup from LSU Press.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821220702/http://www.lsu.edu/lsupress/bookPages/9780807125182.html |date=2008-08-21 }} Retrieved 21 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The losers are contrasted with Eddy, a loan shark, who causes increasing distress among his clients.

The overall message seems to be that nothing really matters, everything is reduced to the same low common denominator. The book is written in a simple style that is easy to read—whether as a novel or as an ambitious experiment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.litteratursiden.dk/sw31076.asp Kirsten Thorup, Baby. From Litteratursiden.dk (in Danish).] Retrieved 21 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel was awarded the [[Pegasus Prize]] for Literature in 1979.

The '''cantonal police''' ({{lang-fr|Police cantonale}}, {{lang-de|Kantonspolizei}}, {{lang-rm|Polizia Chantunala}}, {{lang-it|Polizia cantonale}}) are the principal [[law enforcement]] agencies in each of the 26 [[cantons of Switzerland]]. Law enforcement in Switzerland is mainly a responsibility of the cantons, which each operate cantonal police agencies. Some cities also operate municipal police agencies as provided for by cantonal law. The [[Federal administration of Switzerland|federal government]] provides specialised services and is responsible for the protection of the Swiss border.

The 26 cantonal police agencies and numerous municipal police agencies are the backbone of Swiss law enforcement. They are not subordinate to federal authorities. Their commanding officers report to the head of the respective cantonal or municipal department of police, who is a member of the cantonal or municipal governing council.

Police training is conducted in cantonal service academies and at the Interkantonale Polizeischule Hitzkirch, a joint police academy of twelve police agencies established in 2007. Throughout Switzerland, the police may be reached by the [[emergency telephone number]] 117.

==Organization ==
Currently, the police authority is exercised by the cantons, which are considered sovereign states within the Confederation.&lt;ref name="polis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polis.osce.org/countries/details.php?item_id=72#Country_Profile_Section_328|title=Switzerland|date=22 May 2007|work=POLIS - Policing OnLine Information System|publisher=[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]|accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization of cantonal police forces generally reflects that of the country whose language is the primary language of that canton.&lt;ref name="polis"/&gt;

In the [[French language|French]]-speaking cantons, the police are divided into two sections:&lt;ref name="polis"/&gt;
* the ''[[Gendarmerie (Switzerland)|gendarmerie]]'', a uniformed organization which performs the tasks of police patrol and response, and may conduct judicial enquiries. However, in certain cantons, the gendarmes have the ability to conduct local or judicial enquiries.
* the ''[[sûreté]]'' ('security' or 'safety'), civil investigators who work in the [[Criminal Investigation Department]] (average and serious crime)

In [[German language|German]]-speaking cantons, the police are divided into three sections:&lt;ref name="polis"/&gt;
*the ''[[Kriminalpolizei]]'' (criminal police), who investigate crime and conduct criminal investigations (similar to the ''sûreté'').
*the ''Sicherheitspolizei'' ('security' or 'protection' police), who respond to emergency calls and conduct patrols (similar to the ''gendarmerie'').
*the ''[[Verkehrspolizei]]'' ([[Traffic Police]]) who enforce traffic laws and investigate road traffic accidents.

In [[Italian language|Italian]]-speaking cantons, the police are divided into geographical areas.&lt;ref name="polis"/&gt;

A '''community beat manager''' (CBM) is a [[police officer]] within the [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|British Police]]'s [[territorial police force]]s, such as the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] and [[Greater Manchester Police]]. The CBM is usually responsible for a particular neighbourhood or area of a town or city. Most commonly CBMs are [[Constable]]s. Currently CBMs are part of [[Safer Neighbourhood Policing Teams]] (SNTs), which are commonly made up of a [[Sergeant]], two to three Constables and two [[Police Community Support Officer|PCSOs]]. SNTs use CBMs in a way that is reminiscent of the "British Bobby" in an aid to revive the conception that is thought by the public.

==Lancashire==
Community beat managers in [[Lancashire Constabulary]] are considered problem solvers and aim to address quality of life issues for local residents, and regularly work in partnership with members of the public and other agencies in order to improve their area. Community Beat Managers are accessible to the public and have regular monthly meetings, called PACT Meetings. PACT is an acronym for Police and Communities Together, which the Lancashire Constabulary are keen to promote. Community Beat Managers also hold regular surgeries, so that local residents can consult with their local officer about issues which affect them.

The community beat manager ({{lang-cy|Swyddog Rhawd Cymunedol}}) title has also been adopted by [[North Wales Police]] in their [[Neighbourhood Policing Plan]] to identify their community police officers. The officer's role is similar to the [[Lancashire Constabulary]] model, the officers in [[North Wales]] also have responsibilities to manage and task PCSOs, [[Special Constables]] and [[volunteering|Volunteers]]. The teams manage Community Action Plans and are accountable to their local communities. These action plans can cover a wide range of community-based problems from anti-social behaviour to environmental concerns such as [[graffiti]] removal. All residents in North Wales can identify and find contact details for their [[Neighbourhood Policing Team]]s via the [[North Wales Police]] website.

The '''Conference  NGOs''' ('''CONGO'''; full "Conference of Non-Governmental Organizations in Consultative Relationship with the United Nations") "is an independent, international, non-profit membership association of non-governmental organizations ([[NGO]]s). It facilitates the participation of NGOs in [[United Nations]] debates and decision-making."&lt;ref name="abCONGO"&gt;[http://www.ngocongo.org/index.php?what=about About CONGO] retrieved 30 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The two classes of membership, ''Full'', for those NGOs with consultative status with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]], and ''Associate'', for those with affiliation with a UN programme or agency, total more than 500 members.

Founded in 1948, CONGO has committees based in Geneva, New York and Vienna. Its objectives: "to ensure that NGOs be present when governments discuss issues of global concern at the United Nations and to facilitate NGO discussions on such issues."&lt;ref name="abCONGO"/&gt;

[[Image:Vatican 4.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Entrance to Vatican Museum]]
'''[[Vatican City]]''' is itself of great cultural significance. Buildings such as [[St. Peter's Basilica]] and the [[Sistine Chapel]] are home to some of the most famous art in the world, which includes works by artists such as [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] and [[Michelangelo]]. The [[Vatican Library]] and the collections of the [[Vatican Museums]] are of the highest historical, scientific and cultural importance. In 1984, the Vatican was added by [[UNESCO]] to the List of [[World Heritage Site]]s; it is the only one to consist of an entire country.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/286 |title=Vatican City – UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Vatican can be said to be the de facto custodian of the Latin language through its [[Latinitas Foundation]]. An important product of this foundation is the Latin lexicon of recent neologisms, the ''[[Lexicon Recentis Latinitatis]]''.

The permanent population of the Vatican City is predominantly male, although two communities of nuns live in the Vatican. A minority are senior Catholic [[clergy]], some are members of [[institute of consecrated life|institutes of consecrated life]], and the [[Swiss Guard#Pontifical Swiss Guard|Swiss Guards]] make up an important segment. Many workers in Vatican City and embassy personnel accredited to the [[Holy See]] live outside its walls.

Tourism and pilgrimages are an important factor in the daily life in the Vatican. The Pope has weekly public audiences and celebrates public [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and other services, and imparts his ''[[Urbi et Orbi]]'' blessing every [[Easter]] and [[Christmas]], and immediately following his [[Papal conclave|election]] as Pope. For significant events with large numbers of attendees, he [[Concelebration|concelebrates]] open-air Mass in [[Saint Peter's Square]].

==Dress code==
A dress code is enforced for entry into St. Peter's Basilica. It is based on the standard for proper dress when visiting a Catholic church, with visitors being reminded that, although St. Peter's is an architectural and artistic monument, it is foremost a place of worship. 

The dress code prohibits:
*hats on lay men inside the basilica
*shorts/skirts above the knees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaunted.com/files/6193/VaticanDressing.jpg|title=The Intel|author=|date=|website=Condé Nast Traveler}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*sleeveless shirts
*shirts which contain [[profanity]]
*excessive jewellery

The use of mobile phones inside the basilica is also prohibited, as is smoking.

==Cuisine==
[[File:Spaghetti alla Carbonara.jpg|thumb|Pasta is popular in the Vatican{{cn|date=October 2018}}]]
The Vatican is a [[ministate]], with only one [[restaurant]] and the food there is very similar to [[Italian cuisine]], especially [[Roman cuisine]].  Workers in the Vatican provide many customers to restaurants in the rest of Rome. 

"Eggplant with Parmesan of the [[Swiss Guards]]", a mixture containing [[eggplant]], [[parmesan]] and [[spice]]s, is supposedly one distinctive dish.&lt;ref&gt;http://globaltableadventure.com/2013/10/01/about-the-food-of-vatican-city/ About the food of Vatican City&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ethnicfoodsrus.com/around-the-world-recipes/smallest-countries-worldwide-cuisines/vatican-cuisine/ Vatican Cuisine&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DirecTV-12''', also known as D12, is a [[Boeing 702|Boeing model 702 satellite]] built by the [[Boeing Satellite Development Center]]. It was launched on December 29, 2009 and became operational on May 19, 2010. It is used by [[DirecTV]] to provide additional [[High-definition television|high definition]] channels and [[Video on demand]] content, as well as [[3DTV]] channels and content.

== Technology ==
This satellite is similar to [[DirecTV-10]] and [[DirecTV-11]], but features a 17/24&amp;nbsp;GHz BSS payload carrying the moniker RB-2A.&lt;ref&gt;http://licensing.fcc.gov/ibfsweb/ib.page.FetchAttachment?attachment_key=-173006&lt;/ref&gt;  It is co-located with [[SPACEWAY-1]] and DirecTV-10 very near 103.0°W.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lyngsat.com/Spaceway-1-and-DirecTV-10-12.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Launch data ==

On November 27, the satellite was shipped to the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in the [[Kazakhstan]] desert from the Boeing facility in [[El Segundo, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.satnews.com/cgi-bin/story.cgi?number=183468457 |title=The Boeing — Baikonur Connection For DIRECTV 12 |date=December 2, 2009 |publisher=Satnews Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/2009.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128201450/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/2009.html |archivedate=January 28, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=delivered&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20091127/157005620.html Russia prepares for December launch of DirecTV satellite]&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch was televised publicly live on DirecTV channel 577, on [[C-Band satellite]], and online at ILS's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilslaunch.com/news-122209 ILS Official Site - Media Advisory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010044032/http://ilslaunch.com/news-122209 |date=October 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing stage==

DirecTV-12 reached 76° W on February 11, 2010 and began testing 2 days later. After 3 weeks of scheduled testing, RB-2A began being tested. On April 23, D12 was granted a Special Temporary Authority to continue testing at 76° W for 30 more days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://licensing.fcc.gov/myibfs/download.do?attachment_key=812496 FCC STA for testing at 76 W April 23]&lt;/ref&gt; Testing was completed in late April.

==Drift to final position==

On March 31, 2010 DirecTV filed a Special Temporary Authority for permission to drift to its final position at 103° W.&lt;ref&gt;[http://licensing.fcc.gov/myibfs/download.do?attachment_key=808653 Application for drift to 103 W March 31, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; It was granted on April 23.&lt;ref&gt;[http://licensing.fcc.gov/myibfs/download.do?attachment_key=812524 FCC STA for Drift April 23]&lt;/ref&gt; It reached its final position on May 11 and began operations on May 13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://licensing.fcc.gov/myibfs/download.do?attachment_key=816778 DirecTV notice to FCC of commencement of operations of D12]&lt;/ref&gt; Boeing handed the satellite over to DirecTV on May 17.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boeing.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=1208 Boeing Completes On-Orbit of DirecTV 12 Satellite] ''Boeing.com'' May 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasting to customers==

D12 increased [[DirecTV|DirecTV's]] national HD channel capacity to over 200 channels and expanded its availability of local channels in HD.  DirecTV has used the new satellite to add more HD channels, expand its [[pay-per-view]] movie service "DirecTV Cinema" and [[Video on demand|on demand]] titles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article.aspx?id=539172 DirecTV Using A Window Of Opportunity] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130126152500/http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article.aspx?id=539172 |date=January 26, 2013 }} Investors.com July 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It also carries [[3DTV]] channels. DirecTV began adding new HD channels on May 19 and continued June 23 and later in the summer. DirecTV added the first 3D channel to D12, [[ESPN 3D]], on June 11, and new channels [[n3D]] and a pay-per-view 3D movie channel on July 1. A few more HD channels were added onto it in the fall of 2010, the winter of 2010-11, and the spring and summer of 2011; and more in 2012.

'''"Du hast mich so fasziniert"''' (You fascinated me so much) was the [[Austria]]n entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1960]], performed in [[German Language|German]] by [[Harry Winter]].

The song was performed seventh on the night, following [[Norway]]'s [[Nora Brockstedt]] with "[[Voi Voi]]" and preceding [[Monaco]]'s [[François Deguelt]] with "[[Ce soir-là]]". At the close of voting, it had received 6 points, placing it seventh in a field of 13.

The song is in the ''chanson'' style popular at the Contest at the time, with Winter singing about a girl who fascinated him somewhere in Europe (possibly in [[Madrid]] or [[Rome]]) and about whom he can't stop thinking. At the end of the song, however, he reveals that "everybody knows it, but you" - in other words, he never admitted his fascination to the girl.

The song was succeeded as [[Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest|Austrian representative]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1961|1961 contest]] by [[Jimmy Makulis]] singing "[[Sehnsucht (Jimmy Makulis song)|Sehnsucht]]".

'''''Esli''''' ({{lang-ru|Если}}, Russian for "If") was a [[Russia]]n [[science fiction]] [[literary magazine]]. It was started in 1991 in Moscow, as a publisher of foreign SF stories, but soon broadened its format to include Russophone writers as well. In the 2000s, Esli also started publishing [[fantasy]] short stories and articles on [[futurology]].

The magazine won the European Science Fiction Award ([[Eurocon]] award) for best science fiction magazine in 2000. ''Esli'' closed down by the end of 2012 due to retailing problems. 

In late 2015, the magazine was relaunched with a new team and a new, [[futurology]]-centered subject. It was suspended again in the late 2016.

'''The European Parliament of Enterprises''' (EPE) is an event for European corporations, organized by [[Eurochambres]], the Association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry, once every two years. The first edition of the event was launched on 14 October 2008 on the occasion of Eurochambres' fiftieth anniversary.

==Concept==
The concept of the European Parliament of Enterprises originated from the consideration, that there is a democratic gap between the [[European institutions]] and the main actors of economic growth, entrepreneurs and that, consequently, European legislators do not sufficiently take into account entrepreneurs' concerns. 
On the other hand, businesses are largely unfamiliar with the role and functioning of the [[European Union]] and the significance that the institutions’ decisions can have on their activities and results.

==Participants==
751 entrepreneurs, or Members of the European Parliament of Enterprises (MEPEs), gather in the symbolic location of the [[Espace Léopold|Hemicycle]] of the [[European Parliament]]. The composition of the EPE reflects the number of Members of the European Parliament per member state.

==Aims and objectives==
The EPE aims to bring businesses and institutions face-to-face for one day so as to enhance mutual understanding. The EPE represents a unique opportunity for businesses to have a direct debate with high European representatives and to provide them with a direct bottom-up feedback on EU policy related issues.

==Votes==
During the EPE, Members of the European Parliament of Enterprises exercise their voting rights on major EU business-related issues.
The results of the votes are presented by Eurochambres to the relevant political interlocutors from all of the EU institutions as "the voice of European businesses”.
The "European Parliament of Enterprises” is organised with the active cooperation of Eurochambres' members, the national associations of [[Chamber of commerce|Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry]].

The '''''Global Enabling Trade Report''''' was first published in 2008 by the [[World Economic Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/en/initiatives/gcp/GlobalEnablingTradeReport/index.htm |author=Professor Robert Z. Lawrence, Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, Margareta Drzeniek Hanouz, World Economic Forum, Editors |year=2008 |title=Global Enabling Trade Report 2008 |publisher=World Economic Forum, Geneva, Switzerland |accessdate=2009-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609045010/http://www.weforum.org/en/initiatives/gcp/GlobalEnablingTradeReport/index.htm |archivedate=June 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 report covers 118 major and emerging economies. At the core of the report is the Enabling Trade Index which ranks the countries using data from different sources (e.g., World Economic Forum's Executive Opinion Survey, [[International Trade Centre]], [[World Bank]], the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), [[IATA]], [[ITU]], [[Global Express Association]]).

The Enabling Trade Index measures the factors, policies and services that facilitate the trade in goods across borders and to destination. It is made up of four sub-indexes: 
# Market access
# Border administration
# Transport and communications infrastructure
# Business environment
Each of these sub-indexes contains two to three pillars that assess different aspects of a country's trade environment.

An '''Indo-Pak Confederation''' is a concept advocating a political [[confederation]] of the sovereign states of [[Pakistan]] and [[India]] as means of ending bilateral conflicts and promoting common interests in defence, foreign affairs, culture and economic development. While this idea does not end the sovereign existence of either nation, it is aimed to resolve the conflicts since [[partition of India]] in 1947. 

==Background==
The partition of India took place on August 14, 1947 dividing the provinces of Bengal and Punjab and with the independence of Pakistan as a result of the [[Pakistan movement]], which advocated the "[[Two-Nation Theory]]" - that [[Muslims]] and [[Hindus]] are separate nations that could not live together.&lt;ref name="TW"&gt;[http://www.country-studies.com/pakistan/the-two-nations-theory.html Two-nation theory]&lt;/ref&gt; Partition provoked great communal conflicts and the dispute over the territory of [[Kashmir]] made both nations hostile to each other. India and Pakistan engaged in war in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] and [[Kargil War|1999]]. However, some diplomatic efforts have succeeded in promoting bilateral trade, sports events and permitting Indians and Pakistanis to visit each other's countries through the [[Samjhauta Express]] and the [[Delhi-Lahore Bus]]. The 1972 [[Shimla Agreement]] and subsequent bilateral accords have bound both nations to seek a peaceful solution to the Kashmir conflict while promoting trade and economic co-operation.

==Confederation==
Some politicians and academicians in India  have promoted the concept of a confederation between the two republics as a means to resolve the conflicts while promoting common cultural bonds, economic development and solidarity in major issues, with a ceremonial [[head of state]] and important posts held alternately by Indians and Pakistanis.&lt;ref name="IV"&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20051113/edit.htm#1 Tribune India]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some advocates of the concept perceive the two-nation theory to have been a failure, being unable to resolve conflicts between Muslims and Hindus, and that a closer bonding of the two nations would be the best possible solution.&lt;ref name="ADV"&gt;[http://www.siasat.com/english/index2.php?option=content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=261035 Advani moots Indo-Pak confederation]&lt;/ref&gt; Others have envisaged a broader confederation between the members of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) - [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Sri Lanka]] - akin to the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecumene.org/IIS/csss64.htm Asghar Ali Engineer - IISCSSS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514071152/http://ecumene.org/IIS/csss64.htm |date=2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IV"/&gt; According to some advocates, such an arrangement would not only end the Kashmir conflict and bring peace and progress, but would forge a powerful geo-political entity of equal standing with global power such as the [[United States]], [[European Union]], [[Russian Federation]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name="IV"/&gt; Critics have described the proposal as naive and impractical given the extent of mutual distrust and antagonism.&lt;ref name="RF"&gt; Some leaders of the South Asian region has started talks about the practicality of this idea. Some advocate that the nations be sovereign but they can issue a same currency and also sign an accord with which they can solve defense related problems with other powerful entities of the world like The U.S.A, Russia and China. More of the Indian population has shown some positivity to this idea, though feelings remain sharply polarized overall.[http://www.rediff.com/news/2002/jul/12guest.htm Rediff]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
The idea of a confederation gained prominence with the endorsement of senior Indian political leader and then-[[Deputy Prime Minister of India|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Lal Krishna Advani]], who on April 29, 2004 said in an interview to the Pakistani newspaper ''[[Dawn]]'', that he envisaged both nations coming together to form a confederation: ''"I conceive that there would be a time when decades hence, both the countries would feel that partition has not solved matters. Why not come together and form some form of confederation or something like that."''&lt;ref name="R"&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19990307/ige07052.html Indian Express]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ADV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="II"&gt;[http://news.indiainfo.com/2004/03/03/0303pak.html Advani's remarks on Indo-Pak union a 'mirage'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050422023302/http://news.indiainfo.com/2004/03/03/0303pak.html |date=2005-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another senior Indian politician Dr. [[Ram Manohar Lohia]] had similarly advocated the idea. This public endorsement from Advani, a prominent Hindu leader gave rise to much speculation and media coverage, but the Pakistani Foreign Ministry immediately responded by calling the idea a "mirage," and asserting that both nations were sovereign and this status was in their view "irreversible."&lt;ref name="II"/&gt; Some leaders of the South Asian region have started talks about the practicality of this idea. Some advocates added that the nations be sovereign but they can issue a same currency and also sign an accord with which they can solve defence related problems with world powers like the United States, the European Union, and Russia.

Some Pakistani commentators have pointed out that Indian leaders specifically rejected the notion of such a confederation during the early years of the [[Cold War]]. Others have contended that two nations did not necessarily imply two states, and the fact that Bangladesh did not merge into India despite sharing  cultural similarities especially with Indian Bengal, after separating from Pakistan supports the two nation theory.&lt;ref name="khan2005skd"&gt;{{Citation | title=The concept, Volume 25 | author=Raja Afsar Khan | year=2005 | isbn= |publisher= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-NtAAAAMAAJ | quote=''... The important point is that Bangladesh did not merge with Indian Bengal even though both shared the same language and several other cultural traits ... Did not Bangladesh reconfirm that way the two nation theory ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailytimes1"&gt;{{cite web |title=India and Partition |publisher=Daily Times |url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_10-4-2004_pg3_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:K-komando.jpg|thumb|upright|The insignia of the K-Commando, a special unit of the [[Estonian Police]] established in 1991]]
'''K-Commando''' (K-Komando) is a special unit of the [[Estonia]]n Criminal Police, created in the 1991. It is a special unit of the Estonian police force similar in function to the [[SWAT]] teams in the U.S., and is responsible for such issues as managing [[hostage situation]]s, riot management, high-risk raids and close-protection. The name K-Commando comes from the name of the group's former leader, Lembit Kolk (retired). They were trained by the [[FBI]] and other foreign agencies.

K-Commando is known for its fearsome reputation and high level of professionalism. Recruitment involves rigorous testing and requires the approval of all current team members. Only when a consensus has been reached will the candidate be accepted into the unit. As in other special police units, applicants must have a long [[service record]]. The number of members is undisclosed, and there are no known casualties thus far. The unit operates under the command of the Central Crime Police ([[Keskkriminaalpolitsei]]).

{{LGBT rights}}

'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender''' ('''LGBT''') persons in Chad may face legal challenges not experienced by non-[[LGBT]] residents. Both male and female same-sex sexual activity is illegal in the country. Before the new penal code took effect in August 2017, homosexual activity between adults had never been criminalised.
There is no legal protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

== Law regarding same-sex sexual activity ==
Same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Chad since 2017. Previous to that there were no restrictions. On 12 December 2016, the [[National Assembly (Chad)|National Assembly]] passed an updated penal code criminalising both male and female same-sex sexual activity by a vote of 111 to 1 (with 4 abstentions), but classing acts between consenting adults as a misdemeanour offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/chad-passes-law-make-gay-sex-illegal/#gs.TGGA_mM|title=Chad passes law to make gay sex illegal|date=2016-12-15|newspaper=Gay Star News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 May 2017, the new penal code was enacted by the President [[Idriss Deby]]. 

In supporting the law, the former Prime Minister [[Delwa Kassiré Coumakoye]] argued a religious motivation: "''Homosexuality is condemned by all religions. We do not have to forgive something that God himself rejects because Westerners have said this or that.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.towleroad.com/2016/12/chad-homosexuality/|title=African Nation Chad Is the 77th Country To Criminalize Homosexuality - Towleroad Gay News|date=19 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His comment was criticized by some LGBT historians who controversially maintain that homophobia was brought to Chad by colonialism, despite the existence of Islamic law in the nation prior to imperial rule. These historians believe that homosexuality was quite commonplace and accepted before the arrival of the Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/23/africa-homophobia-uganda-anti-gay-law|title=Why Africa is a hotbed of homophobia|first=David|last=Smith|date=23 February 2014|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US-based [[Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights]] called on the President of Chad not to enact the changes to the law, which is linked to a rise in [[homophobia]] in Africa in response to the increased visibility and assertiveness of gay lifestyles and politics in Africa, and the engagement of fundamentalist christians. This includes the financing of anti-gay campaigns by American evangelical churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/22/chad-37th-african-state-seeking-ban-homosexuality|title=Chad becomes 37th African state to seek ban on homosexuality|first=David|last=Smith|date=22 September 2014|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-groundtruth-project/anti-lgbt-groups-making-i_b_7573652.html|title=Anti-LGBT Groups Making Inroads Across East Africa|first=The GroundTruth|last=Project|date=12 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It became law on 1 August 2017.&lt;ref name="Penal Code 2017/2" /&gt;

Chapter II on "Other offenses against decency" of Title VII (relating to sexual offences) of the Penal Code, provides as follows:
:''Article 354. Everyone who has sex with persons of the same sex is liable to imprisonment for three months to two years and a fine of between 50,000 and 500,000 francs.''&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The official text of Article 354 in French ([http://data.over-blog-kiwi.com/1/20/85/70/20170923/ob_d3b926_code-penal-2e-partie.pdf Code Pénal Tchad, page 20]):&lt;blockquote&gt;Est puni d'un emprisonnement de trois mois à deux ans et d'une amende e 50.000 à 500.000 francs, quiconque a des rapports sexuels avec les personnes de son sexe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter III on "Offenses of a sexual nature committed against minors" of Title VIII (relating to offenses against the person or the status of the child) of the Penal Code, provides as follows:
:''Article 360. Anyone who, without violence, maintains a sexual relationship or practices sexual touching on a person of the same sex aged less than eighteen (18) years will be punished with imprisonment of one (1) to three (3) years and a fine of 100,000 to 500,000 francs.''&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The official text of Article 360 in French:&lt;blockquote&gt;Sera puni d'un emprisonnement de un (1) á trois (3) ans et d'une amende de 100.000 à 500.000 francs, quiconque, sans violence, entretient une relation sexuelle ou practique des attouchments de nature sexuelle sur une personne de son sexe âgée de moins de dix-huit (18) ans.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual orientation ==
Article 350(i) of the Penal Code provides imprisonment of ten to twenty years when the rape is committed because of the [[sexual orientation]] of the victim.&lt;ref name="Penal Code 2017/1" /&gt;

== Gender identity/expression ==
The legal standing of [[transgender]] persons is unknown.

== Recognition of same sex relationships ==
There is no legal recognition of [[same-sex couples]].

== Living conditions ==

The [[U.S. Department of State]]'s 2010 Human Rights Report found that "there were no known lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) organizations. There were few reports of violence or discrimination against LGBT persons, in large part because most such persons were discreet about sexual orientation due to social and cultural strictures against homosexuality."&lt;ref name="Ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/160115.pdf|title=CHAD|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''La Première (RTI)''' is a pioneering terrestrial television channel in [[Côte d'Ivoire]]. It was formerly named '''[[Radio Télévision Ivoirienne]]''' (RTI), (the name of the company operating it) from 1963 to 1983, but in 1983 a new television channel made it necessary for the channel to be renamed to ''La Première''.

==History==
It was first broadcast on August 7, 1963, established by the then President of the Republic [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] who wanted to make it an instrument of development.&lt;ref&gt;Africa Film &amp; TV, Z Promotions (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 August 1966, two studios in [[Cocody]], 100m2 and 400m2 respectively were built with quality equipment. In 1973 the station began broadcasting in color. 

Following the launch of a second television channel, [[CH2 (television)|CH2]] on December 9, 1983, RTI was renamed La Première.

It was found by the [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]] (GIMPS) in 2017.&lt;ref name="M77232"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mersenne.org/primes/press/M77232917.html|title=50th Known Mersenne Prime Discovered|website=www.mersenne.org|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Euclid]] [[Euclid's theorem|proved that]] there is no largest [[prime number]], and many mathematicians and hobbyists continue to search for large prime numbers.

Many of the largest known primes are [[Mersenne prime]]s. {{As of|2018|July}}, the seven largest known primes are Mersenne primes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://primes.utm.edu/primes/search.php?Number=100 |title=The largest known primes - Database Search Output |first1=Chris |last1=Caldwell |date= |publisher=Prime Pages |access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last sixteen record primes were Mersenne primes.&lt;ref name="computerhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://primes.utm.edu/notes/by_year.html |title=The Largest Known Prime by Year: A Brief History |first1=Chris |last1=Caldwell |date= |publisher=Prime Pages |access-date=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The last non-Mersenne to be the largest known prime, was [http://primes.utm.edu/primes/page.php?id=390 391,581 ⋅ 2&lt;sup&gt;216,193&lt;/sup&gt; − 1]; see also [http://primes.utm.edu/notes/by_year.html The Largest Known Prime by Year: A Brief History] by Caldwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fast Fourier transform]] implementation of the [[Lucas–Lehmer primality test]] for [[Mersenne number]]s is fast compared to other known primality tests for other kinds of numbers.

==Current record==
The record is currently held by 2&lt;sup&gt;77,232,917&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 with 23,249,425 digits, found by [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search|GIMPS]] in December 2017.&lt;ref name="M77232"/&gt; Its value is:

==Prizes==
The [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]] (GIMPS) currently offers a US$3000 research discovery award for participants who download and run their free software and whose computer discovers a new Mersenne prime having fewer than 100 million digits.

There are several prizes offered by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] for record primes.&lt;ref name="prizes"/&gt; GIMPS is also coordinating its long-range search efforts for primes of 100 million digits and larger and will split the Electronic Frontier Foundation's US$150,000 prize with a winning participant.

The record passed one million digits in 1999, earning a US$50,000 prize.&lt;ref&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation, [https://www.eff.org/press/releases/big-prime-nets-big-prize Big Prime Nets Big Prize].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the record passed ten million digits, earning a US$100,000 prize and a [[Cooperative Computing Award]] from the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].&lt;ref name="prizes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2009/10/14-0 |title=Record 12-Million-Digit Prime Number Nets $100,000 Prize |date=October 14, 2009 |work=Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=November 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called it the 29th-top invention of 2008.&lt;ref name="invention"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1852747_1854195_1854157,00.html |title=Best Inventions of 2008 - 29.

Additional prizes are being offered for the first prime number found with at least one hundred million digits and the first with at least one billion digits.&lt;ref name="prizes"/&gt;

==History==
The following table lists the progression of the largest known prime number in ascending order.&lt;ref name="computerhistory"/&gt; Here M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 is the [[Mersenne number]] with exponent ''n''. The longest record-holder known was M&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; = 524,287, which was the largest known prime for 144 years. No records are known before 1456.

In the declaration '''Manifesto for a Global Economic Ethic''' fundamental principles and values of a global economy are set forth, according to the Declaration toward a Global Ethic issued by the [[Parliament of World Religions]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weltethos.org/dat-english/index.htm Declaration Toward a Global Ethic, Parliament of the World´s Religions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721233349/http://www.weltethos.org/dat-english/index.htm |date=2010-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Chicago 1993). In 2009 the Manifesto for a Global Economic Ethic was presented at a joint event with the [[UN Global Compact]] at the [[UN]] headquarters in New York. First signatories&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaleconomicethic.org/03_01a-signatories.php First signatories of the Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt; include renowned international leaders such as [[Mary Robinson]], former president of Ireland, and Archbishop emeritus [[Desmond Tutu]], Nobel Peace Prize Laureate.

== Content of the Manifesto&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaleconomicethic.org/02-manifesto-02-eng.php Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt; ==
The Manifesto lays out the fundamental principles and values of a global economy. The goal of the manifesto is to start a dialog. It aims to address all stakeholder groups in the business world, to create a cultural and ethical framework across borders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaleconomicethic.org/03-aims-02-eng.php Hans Küng, Commentary „What does the Manifesto for a Global Economic Ethic propose“, 8 October 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
All players should respect and protect the internationally accepted codes of conduct for business, and contribute to realizing them within their sphere of influence. The signatories commit themselves to be guided by both the letter and the spirit of this declaration in their day-to-day business decisions, actions, and conduct.

=== Fundamental principle: Humanity ===
The principle of '''humanity''' must be the ethical yardstick for all economic action. 
* [[Sustainability]]
* [[Respect]]
* Fair Cooperation
* [[Golden Rule]]

=== Basic values for global economic activity ===
The following basic values for doing business globally further develop the principle of humanity. They make suggestions for decisions, actions, and general behaviour in the practical sphere of economic life.
* [[Non-violence]] and Respect for life
* [[Justice]] and [[Solidarity]]
* [[Honesty]] and [[Toleration|Tolerance]]
* Mutual respect and [[partnership]]

'''Mid Point''' is a skiway located in the [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]] at midway between [[Zucchelli Station]] and the inland [[Concordia Station]]. Mid Point Airstrip, being at {{convert|530|km}} from Zucchelli, is a refuelling place for the aircraft on their way to Concordia. The place is equipped with shelters, meteorological equipment, [[fuel bladder]]s and tractors to clean the airstrip. An American researchers team lived at the camp for a time, in 2000, to carry out a project of [[ice drilling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gdargaud.net/Antarctica/AntarBases.html | title = Mid Point Charlie | website = gdargaud.net | publisher = | accessdate = October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"More than Love"''' was the [[Malta|Maltese]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994]], performed in [[English language|English]] by Cristopher Scicluna &amp; Moira Stafrace.

The song is a ballad, with the duo singing about the power of music to help people reach their dreams. Significantly, no [[Maltese language]] version was recorded, only the second time in history that this was the case.

The song was performed twelfth on the night, following [[Romania]]'s [[Dan Bittman]] with "[[Dincolo de nori]]" and preceding [[The Netherlands]]' [[Willeke Alberti]] with "[[Waar is de zon?]]". At the close of voting, it had received 97 points, placing 5th in a field of 25.

It was succeeded as Maltese representative at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1995|1995 Contest]] by Mike Spiteri with "[[Keep Me In Mind (Mike Spiteri song)|Keep Me In Mind]]".

[[File:Union Now postwar edition.jpg|thumb|right|px|Front cover of the postwar edition of Clarence Streit's ''Union Now''.]]

'''''Union Now''''' is a book by journalist [[Clarence Streit]] calling for a federal union of fifteen of the world's major [[democracies]]. The first edition of the book was published in 1939. The book attracted public attention to world federalist and [[Atlanticism|Atlanticist]] ideas and helped lay the groundwork for the efforts of Streit's organization Federal Union, Inc. (which later became the [[Association to Unite the Democracies]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaud.org/history.html |title=History |accessdate=29 July 2009 |publisher=Association to Unite the Democracies |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828024924/http://www.iaud.org/history.html |archivedate=28 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

As a ''[[New York Times]]'' correspondent at the [[League of Nations]], Streit was disturbed by the democracies' apparent inability to deal with such crises as the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] and the rise of [[Nazism]]. He came to the conclusion that at the root of the League's problems were [[nationalism]] and the democracies' ignorance of their own share of the world's economic and military power.&lt;ref&gt;'Elijah *from Missoula', ''Time'', March 27, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; Streit began work on his proposal for a union of democracies in 1933. In 1938, with [[World War II|world war]] appearing increasingly likely, the book was accepted for publication by [[Harper &amp; Brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Darling, 'The 50-Year Mission; Clarence Streit's Dream of a Transatlantic Union and the Promise of Peace', ''Washington Post'', . p. B1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==

Streit proposed a “nucleus” of fifteen nations that he regarded as relatively mature democracies: The [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[Ireland]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. This union was to be organized roughly along the lines of the [[federalism in the United States|federal system of the United States]]: while some power would be ceded to the newly established central authority, each nation would retain some measure of sovereignty. Nations that the federation deemed worthy of membership would be added subsequently on the basis of their commitment to democracy, with the hope that the union would eventually come to encompass the entire globe.

== Reception and legacy ==

Writing in the ''New York Times'', historian [[James Truslow Adams]] offered cautious praise for Streit's proposal, stating that "[s]ome day, in the kind of world we live in, with space annihilated and interdependence between nations complete, something like what Mr. Streit suggests will have to come to pass."&lt;ref&gt;James Truslow Adams, 'A Union of the Democracies: Mr. Streit's Plan for a Federation to Safeguard the World's Peace', ''New York Times'', February 19, 1939. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian]] also praised the book, describing Streit's plan as a democratic, peaceful alternative to the ideological visions provided by fascism and communism.&lt;ref&gt;'New Peace Plan Hailed by Lothian', ''New York Times'', March 6, 1939. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, it was partly in response to ''Union Now'' that [[George Orwell]] wrote his famous essay "Not Counting Niggers", in which he called the 'democratic' character of Streit's proposed union into doubt. While writing that Streit had "an essentially decent cast of mind," Orwell expressed pessimism about Streit's mission:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[O]ne begins to see what would really be happening if Mr Streit's scheme were put into operation. The British and French empires, with their six hundred million disenfranchised human beings, would simply be receiving fresh police forces; the huge strength of the USA would be behind the robbery of India and Africa. Mr Streit is letting cats out of bags, but all phrases like ‘Peace Bloc’, ‘Peace Front’, etc contain some such implication; all imply a tightening-up of the existing structure.''&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell, 'Not Counting Niggers', ''The Adelphi'', July 1939.[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/o/orwell/george/not-counting-niggers/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors''' ({{lang-my|မြန်မာ ကျောင်းသား စစ်သည်တော်များ အဖွဲ့}}; [[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''VBSW''') were an [[Insurgency|armed opposition group]] in [[Myanmar]] (Burma). It was formed by students after the [[8888 uprising]], in opposition to the ruling [[military junta]] at the time.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC News {{!}} Asia-Pacific {{!}} Embassy gunmen flee|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/463569.stm|work=BBC News|date=2 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was labeled (but not officially listed as) a [[terrorist organisation]] by the Burmese government, after they gained notoriety by [[1999 Myanmar Embassy siege|raiding and holding hostages]] at the Burmese embassy in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] in October 1999.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

==History==
After the [[Myanmar general election, 1990|1990 general election]], which was unrecognised and suppressed by the newly formed [[military junta]], many students that participated in the [[8888 uprising]] fled the country and went to neighbouring Thailand. In August 1999, the VBSW was formed as an armed opposition group, which differentiated from groups such as the [[All Burma Students' Democratic Front]], which originally sought democracy through peaceful demonstrations. 

On 1 October 1999, a group of five members raided the Burmese consulate in Bangkok and took 89 people hostage. The group demanded that negotiations be opened between the [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD) and the military junta, and that a new [[Hluttaw]] (national parliament) be convened based on the results of the 1990 election. However, the group soon relaxed their demands and began to release hostages, and the Thai government eventually escorted the VBSW members by helicopter to the Thai-Myanmar border.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Harvey W.|last=Kushner|year=2003|contribution=Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors|title=Encyclopedia of Terrorism|publisher=Sage Publications|pages=395–396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite openly supporting the democracy movement in Myanmar, lead figures of the movement such as [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], the President of the NLD, have denounced the VBSW, and their use of violence to achieve their goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fas.org/irp/world/para/vbsw.htm fas.org - IRP World]&lt;/ref&gt;

  | accessdate =2010-11-06  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zémidjans are [[motorcycles]] that carry one to two passengers for short distances in towns. The fares are entirely negotiable. The drivers wear uniforms that are color-coded by city and have registration numbers on the back. The name derives from the [[Fon language]] where zémidjan means "get me there fast" or "take me quickly".&lt;ref name="BTN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USAID"&gt;{{cite web|title=Motorcycle taxi drivers hit the streets of Cotonou with AIDS prevention messages |publisher=[[USAID]] Benin |url=http://www.usaid.gov/bj/health/p-hiv.html |accessdate=2007-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314192028/http://www.usaid.gov/bj/health/p-hiv.html |archivedate=March 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The way to call a zémidjan is "kekeno", a word derived from the Fon language. 'Keke' means motorcycle and 'no' means the 'owner of': Kekeno thus literally means 'owner of motorcycle'. The zémidjan typically stops by and the passenger and driver negotiate the price, depending on the final destination. The minimum rate is 100FCFA.

A movie called ''Dreamcycles'' by Nelson Roubert was made about the kekenos of Tevisodji Park.
