First, the predators approach their potential prey. Predators bite or try to swallow the hagfishes, but the hagfishes have already projected jets of slime (arrows) into the predators' mouths. Choking, the predators release the hagfishes and gag in an attempt to remove slime from their mouths and gill chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Zintzen | first1=Vincent | last2=Roberts | first2=Clive D. | last3=Anderson | first3=Marti J. | last4=Stewart | first4=Andrew L. | last5=Struthers | first5=Carl D. | last6=Harvey | first6=Euan S. | title=Hagfish Slime as a Defense Mechanism against Gill-breathing Predators | journal=Scientific Reports | volume=1 | page=2011 | doi=10.1038/srep00131| year=2011 | bibcode=2011NatSR...1E.131Z | pmid=22355648 | pmc=3216612}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Anti-predator adaptations''' are mechanisms developed through [[evolution]] that assist [[prey]] organisms in their constant struggle against [[predator]]s. Throughout the animal kingdom, adaptations have evolved for every stage of this struggle, namely by avoiding detection, warding off attack, fighting back, or escaping when caught.

The first line of defence consists in avoiding detection, through mechanisms such as [[camouflage]], [[Masquerade (biology)|masquerade]], [[apostatic selection]], living underground, or [[nocturnal]]ity. 

Alternatively, prey animals may ward off attack, whether by advertising the presence of strong defences in [[aposematism]], by [[mimicry|mimicking]] animals which do possess such defences, by [[deimatic behaviour|startling]] the attacker, by [[signalling theory|signalling to the predator]] that pursuit is not worthwhile, by [[distraction display|distraction]], by using defensive structures such as spines, and by [[social animal|living in a group]]. Members of groups are at [[selfish herd theory|reduced risk of predation]], despite the increased conspicuousness of a group, through improved vigilance, predator confusion, and the likelihood that the predator will attack some other individual.

Some prey species are capable of fighting back against predators, whether [[autohaemorrhaging|with chemicals]], through [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|communal defence]], or by ejecting noxious materials. Many animals can escape by fleeing rapidly, outrunning or outmanoeuvring their attacker. 

Finally, some species are able to escape even when caught by [[autotomy|sacrificing certain body parts]]: crabs can shed a claw, while lizards can shed their tails, often distracting predators long enough to permit the prey to escape.

==Avoiding detection==

===Staying out of sight===
{{main article|Nocturnality}}
[[File:Seychelles Fruit Bat - Pteropus seychellensis.jpg|thumb|[[Fruit bat]]s forage [[nocturnality|by night]] to avoid predators.]]

Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether [[Troglobite|in caves]], [[Fossorial|underground]], or by being [[nocturnality|nocturnal]].&lt;ref name=Sherbrooke117/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cott, H.B. |date=1940 |title=Adaptive Coloration in Animals |publisher=Methuen |location=London |pages=330–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duverge, P.L. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Duverge | first1=P.L. | last2=Jones | first2=G | last3=Rydell | first3=J. | last4=Ransome | first4=R. | date=2000 | title=Functional significance of emergence timing in bats | journal=Ecography | volume=23 | pages=32–40 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0587.2000.tb00258.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daly M. 1992"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Daly | first1=M. | last2=Behrends | first2=P.R. | last3=Wilson | first3=M. | last4=Jacobs | first4=L. | date=1992 | title=Behavioural modulation of predation risk: moonlight avoidance and crepuscular compensation in a nocturnal desert rodent, Dipodomys merriami | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=44 | pages=1–9 | doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(05)80748-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called [[crypsis]] used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating [[bats]]. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from [[bat hawk]]s and [[bat falcon]]s. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.&lt;ref name="Duverge, P.L. 2000"/&gt;
Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in [[kangaroo rat]]s, which avoid moonlight. They forage in relatively open habitats and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness.&lt;ref name="Daly M. 1992"/&gt;

[[File:Phrynosoma mcallii.jpg|thumb|right|[[Camouflage]] illustrated by the [[flat-tail horned lizard]], its flattened, fringed and [[disruptively patterned]] body eliminating shadow]]

===Camouflage===
{{main article|Camouflage}}

[[Camouflage]] uses any combination of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment to make the organism hard to detect by sight. It is common in both terrestrial and marine animals. Camouflage can be achieved in many different ways, such as through resemblance to surroundings, [[disruptive coloration]], shadow elimination by [[countershading]] or [[counter-illumination]], self-decoration, cryptic behavior, or changeable skin patterns and colour.{{sfn|Cott|1940}}{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=35–60}} Animals such as the [[flat-tail horned lizard]] of North America have evolved to eliminate their shadow and blend in with the ground. The bodies of these lizards are flattened, and their sides thin towards the edge. This body form, along with the white scales fringed along their sides, allows the lizards to effectively hide their shadows. In addition, these lizards hide any remaining shadows by pressing their bodies to the ground.&lt;ref name=Sherbrooke117&gt;{{cite book | author=Sherbrooke, W. C. |date=2003 | title=Introduction to horned lizards of North America | publisher=University of California Press |pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masquerade===
[[File:Kallima inachus qtl1.jpg|thumb|''[[Kallima inachus]]'' [[Masquerade (biology)|masquerading]] as a dead leaf]]

Animals can hide in plain sight by [[Masquerade (biology)|masquerading]] as inedible objects. For example, the [[potoo]], a South American bird, habitually perches on a tree, convincingly resembling a broken stump of a branch,{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=53–55}} while a butterfly, ''[[Kallima]]'', looks just like a dead leaf.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=318–320}}

===Apostatic selection===

Another way to remain unattacked in plain sight is to look different from other members of the same species. Predators such as [[Parus|tits]] selectively hunt for abundant types of insect, ignoring less common types that were present, forming [[search image]]s of the desired prey. This creates a mechanism for negative [[frequency-dependent selection]], [[apostatic selection]].{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=61–65}}

==Warding off attack==
[[File:Gottesanbeterin Abwehr.JPG|thumb|A Mediterranean [[mantis]], ''[[Iris oratoria]]'', attempting to startle a predator with [[deimatic behaviour]]]]

Many species make use of behavioral strategies to deter predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cooper |first1=William E |title=Antipredatory Behavior |url=http://idea.ucr.edu/documents/flash/antipredatory_behavior_1/story.htm |website=IDEA |publisher=University of California, Riverside |accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Startling the predator===
{{main article|Deimatic behaviour}}

Many weakly-defended animals, including [[moth]]s, [[butterflies]], [[Mantidae|mantises]], [[Phasmidae|phasmids]], and [[cephalopods]] such as octopuses, make use of patterns of threatening or [[deimatic behaviour|startling behaviour]], such as suddenly displaying conspicuous [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]], so as to scare off or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal an opportunity to escape. In the absence of toxins or other defences, this is essentially bluffing, in contrast to aposematism which involves honest signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1464793105006810 |author=Stevens, Martin |authorlink=Martin Stevens (biologist) |title=The role of eyespots as anti-predator mechanisms, principally demonstrated in the Lepidoptera |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=80 |issue=4 |date=2005 |pages=573–588 |pmid=16221330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Springer&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/86053.html | title=Deimatic Behavior | publisher=Springer | date=2012 | accessdate=31 December 2012 | author=Edmunds, Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.conchsoc.org/node/6014 | title=Octopus vulgaris. Dymantic display | publisher=The Conchological Society of Great Britain and Ireland | date=3 December 2012 | accessdate=1 January 2013 | author=Smith, Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pursuit-deterrent signals===
{{further information|Signalling theory}}
[[File:Stotting gazelle.jpg|thumb|An [[impala]] [[stotting]], [[signalling honestly]] to the predator that the chase will be unprofitable]]

Pursuit-deterrent signals are behavioral signals used by prey that convince predators not to pursue them. For example, [[gazelle]]s [[stotting|stot]], jumping high with stiff legs and an arched back. This is thought to signal to predators that they have a high level of fitness and can outrun the predator. As a result, predators may choose to pursue a different prey that is less likely to outrun them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Caro, T. M. |authorlink=Tim Caro |date=1986 |title=The functions of stotting in Thomson's gazelles: Some tests of the predictions |journal=Animal Behaviour |issue=3 |pages=663–684 |doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(86)80052-5 |volume=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[White-tailed deer]] and other prey mammals flag with conspicuous (often black and white) tail markings when alarmed, informing the predator that it has been detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bildstein |first1=Keith L. |title=Why White-Tailed Deer Flag Their Tails |journal=The American Naturalist |date=May 1983 |volume=121 |issue=5 |pages=709–715 |doi=10.1086/284096 |jstor=2460873}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Warning calls given by birds such as the [[Eurasian jay]] are similarly [[honest signal]]s, benefiting both predator and prey: the predator is informed that it has been detected and might as well save time and energy by giving up the chase, while the prey is protected from attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bergstrom |first=C. T. |last2=Lachmann |first2=M. |year=2001 |title=Alarm calls as costly signals of antipredator vigilance: the watchful babbler game |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=535–543 |doi=10.1006/anbe.2000.1636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Getty |first=T. |year=2002 |title=The discriminating babbler meets the optimal diet hawk |journal=Anim. Behav. |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=397H. Carl 402 |doi=10.1006/anbe.2001.1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Playing dead===
{{main article|apparent death}}
[[File:Heterodon platirhinos 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eastern hog-nosed snake]] [[Apparent death|playing dead]]]]

Another pursuit-deterrent signal is [[apparent death|thanatosis or playing dead]]. Thanatosis is a form of bluff in which an animal mimics its own dead body, [[deception|feigning]] death to avoid being attacked by predators seeking live prey. Thanatosis can also be used by the predator in order to lure prey into approaching.&lt;ref name=Pasteur&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Pasteur | first1=G | date=1982 | title=A classificatory review of mimicry systems | url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125 | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume=13 | pages=169–199 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of this is seen in white-tailed deer fawns, which experience a drop in heart rate in response to approaching predators. This response, referred to as "alarm bradycardia", causes the fawn's heart rate to drop from 155 to 38 beats per minute within one beat of the heart. This drop in heart rate can last up to two minutes, causing the fawn to experience a depressed breathing rate and decrease in movement, called tonic immobility. Tonic immobility is a reflex response that causes the fawn to enter a low body position that simulates the position of a dead corpse. Upon discovery of the fawn, the predator loses interest in the "dead" prey. Other symptoms of alarm bradycardia, such as salivation, urination, and defecation, can also cause the predator to lose interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Alboni | first1=Paolo | last2=Alboni | first2=Marco | last3=Bertorelle | first3=Giorgio | date=2008 | title=The origin of vasovagal syncope: to protect the heart or to escape predation? | journal=Clinical Autonomic Research | volume=18 | issue=4| pages=170–8 | doi=10.1007/s10286-008-0479-7| pmid=18592129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distraction===
[[File:Charadrius vociferus tx1.jpg|thumb|A [[killdeer]] plover, [[distraction display|distracting a predator]] from its nest by feigning a broken wing]]
{{main article|phagomimicry|distraction display}}

Marine [[mollusc]]s such as [[sea hare]]s, [[cuttlefish]], [[squid]] and [[octopus]]es give themselves a last chance to escape by distracting their attackers. To do this, they eject a mixture of chemicals, which may [[phagomimicry|mimic food]] or otherwise confuse predators.&lt;ref name="Mason 2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/2005/03/sea-hares-lose-their-lunch |title=Sea Hares Lose Their Lunch |author=Inman, Mason |date=29 March 2005 |website=Sciencemag.org |accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Derby&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Derby |first1=Charles D. |title=Escape by Inking and Secreting: Marine Molluscs Avoid Predators Through a Rich Array of Chemicals and Mechanisms |journal=The Biological Bulletin |date=December 2007 |volume=213 |issue=3 |pages=274–289 |doi=10.2307/25066645|jstor=25066645 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a predator, animals in these groups release [[cephalopod ink|ink]], creating a cloud, and opaline, affecting the predator's feeding senses, causing it to attack the cloud.&lt;ref name="Mason 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Derby, Kicklighter et al (2007)"&gt;{{cite journal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115142409/http://www2.gsu.edu/~biocdd/Publications/Reprints/2007/Derby%20et%20al%20joun%20chem%20eco%202007.pdf |archivedate=15 November 2009 |url=https://www2.gsu.edu/~biocdd/Publications/Reprints/2007/Derby%20et%20al%20joun%20chem%20eco%202007.pdf |title=Chemical Composition of Inks of Diverse Marine Molluscs Suggests Convergent Chemical Defenses |author=Derby, Charles D. |author2=Kicklighter, Cynthia E. |author3=Johnson,  P.

[[Distraction display]]s attract the attention of predators away from an object, typically the nest or young, that is being protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Barrows, Edward M. |date=2001 |title=Animal behavior |publisher=CRC Press |edition=2nd |page=177 | isbn=0-8493-2005-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distraction displays are performed by some species of birds, which may feign a broken wing while hopping about on the ground, and by some species of fish.{{sfn|Ruxton|Sherratt|Speed|2004|page=198}}

===Mimicry and aposematism===
{{main article|mimicry|aposematism}}
[[File:BatesMimButter.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|left|alt=Viceroy and monarch butterflies illustrate Müllerian mimicry|[[Viceroy butterfly|Viceroy]] and [[monarch butterfly|monarch]] are [[Müllerian mimicry|Müllerian mimics]], similar in appearance, unpalatable to predators.]]

[[Mimicry]] occurs when an organism (the mimic) simulates signal properties of another organism (the model) to confuse a third organism. This results in the mimic gaining protection, food, and mating advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Endler, J. A. |title=An overview of the relationships between mimicry and crypsis |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |date=1981 |volume=16 |pages=25–31 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1981.tb01840.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two classical types of defensive mimicry: Batesian and Müllerian. Both involve [[aposematic]] [[animal coloration|coloration]]&lt;!--this means a pattern of more than one color--&gt;, or warning signals, to avoid being attacked by a predator.&lt;ref name=HolmgrenEnquist/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ritland1/&gt;

In [[Batesian mimicry]], a palatable, harmless prey species mimics the appearance of another species that is noxious to predators, thus reducing the mimic's risk of attack.&lt;ref name=HolmgrenEnquist&gt;{{cite journal | author=Holmgren, H. | author2=Enquist, M. | title=Dynamics of mimicry evolution | journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society | date=1999 | volume=66  | pages=145–158 | doi=10.1006/bijl.1998.0269}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of mimicry is seen in many [[insect]]s. The idea behind Batesian mimicry is that predators that have tried to eat the unpalatable species learn to associate its colors and markings with an unpleasant taste. This results in the predator learning to avoid species displaying similar colours and markings, including Batesian mimics, which are in effect parasitic on the chemical or other defences of the unprofitable models.&lt;ref name=Bates&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bates | first1=H.

[[File:Erethizon dorsatum du Québec.jpg|thumb|The porcupine ''[[Erethizon dorsatum]]'' combines sharp [[spine (zoology)|spines]] with [[warning coloration]]]]

===Defensive structures===

Many animals are protected against predators with armour in the form of hard shells (such as most [[mollusc]]s), leathery or scaly skin (as in [[reptile]]s), or tough chitinous exoskeletons (as in [[arthropod]]s).{{sfn|Ruxton|Sherratt|Speed|2004|page=198}}

A [[spine (zoology)|spine]] is a sharp, needle-like structure used to inflict pain on predators. An example of this seen in nature is in the [[Sohal surgeonfish]]. These fish have a sharp scalpel-like spine on the front of each of their tail fins, able to inflict deep wounds.

Many species of slug caterpillar, [[Limacodidae]], have numerous protuberances and stinging spines along their dorsal surfaces.

==Safety in numbers==
{{further information|Social animal}}

Group living can decrease the risk of predation to the individual in a variety of ways,{{sfn|Edmunds|1974|pages=202–207}} as described below.

===Dilution effect===

A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group "dilute" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] and [[W.D. Hamilton]] proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the [[Shoaling and schooling|shoaling]] of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in [[Camargue horse]]s in Southern France. The [[horse-fly]] often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently.&lt;ref name=Duncan&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Duncan | first1=P. | last2=Vigne | first2=N. | date=1979 | title=The effect of group size in horses on the rate of attacks by blood-sucking flies | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=27 | pages=623–625 | doi=10.1016/0003-3472(79)90201-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water striders]] are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Foster | first1=W.A. | last2=Treherne | first2=J.E. | date=1981 | title=Evidence for the dilution effect in the selfish herd from fish predation on a marine insect | journal=Nature | volume=295 | pages=466–467 | doi=10.1038/293466a0| bibcode=1981Natur.293..466F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Domain of Danger Graphic.jpg|thumb|In a group, prey seek central positions in order to reduce their domain of danger. Individuals along the outer edges of the group are more at risk of being targeted by the predator.]]

===Selfish herd===

{{main article|Selfish herd theory}}

The selfish herd theory was proposed by [[W.D. Hamilton]] to explain why animals seek central positions in a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Hamilton | authorlink=W. D. Hamilton | first1=W. | title=Geometry for the selfish herd | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume=31 | issue=2 | pages=295–311 | date=1971 | pmid=5104951 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(71)90189-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory's central idea is to reduce the individual's domain of danger. A domain of danger is the area within the group in which the individual is more likely to be attacked by a predator. The center of the group has the lowest domain of danger, so animals are predicted to strive constantly to gain this position. Testing Hamilton's selfish herd effect, Alta De Vos and Justin O'Rainn (2010) studied [[brown fur seal]] predation from [[great white shark]]s. Using decoy seals, the researchers varied the distance between the decoys to produce different domains of danger. The seals with a greater domain of danger had an increased risk of shark attack.&lt;ref name="De Vos ORiain 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last=De Vos | first=A. | last2=O'Riain | first2=M. J. | title=Sharks shape the geometry of a selfish seal herd: experimental evidence from seal decoys | journal=Biology Letters | volume=6 | issue=1 | date=September 2009 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.0628 | pages=48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predator satiation===
[[File:White cicada.jpg|thumb|left|A newly emerged [[Magicicada|periodical cicada]]: millions emerge at once, at long intervals, likely to [[predator satiation|satiate predators]].]]

{{main article|Predator satiation|Periodical cicada}}

A radical strategy for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill a large majority of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the [[periodical cicadas]], which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so [[predator satiation]] is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Williams, K.S. |author2=C. Simon |last-author-amp=yes |date=1995 |title=The ecology, behavior, and evolution of periodical cicadas |journal=[[Annual Review of Entomology]] |volume=40 |pages=269–295 |doi=10.1146/annurev.en.40.010195.001413 |url=http://hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu/projects/cicada/resources/reprints/Williams%26Simon_1995.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chlorocebus pygerythrus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chlorocebus pygerythrus|Vervet monkeys]] have different [[alarm signal]]s that warn of attacks by [[eagle]]s, [[leopard]]s and [[snake]]s.]]

===Alarm calls===

{{main article|Alarm signal}}

Animals that live in groups often give [[alarm signal|alarm calls]] that give warning of an attack. For example, [[vervet monkey]]s give different calls depending on the nature of the attack: for an [[eagle]], a disyllabic cough; for a [[leopard]] or other cat, a loud bark; for a [[python (genus)|python]] or other snake, a "chutter". The monkeys hearing these calls respond defensively, but differently in each case: to the eagle call, they look up and run into cover; to the leopard call, they run up into the trees; to the snake call, they stand on two legs and look around for snakes, and on seeing the snake, they sometimes mob it. Similar calls are found in other species of monkey, while birds also give different calls that elicit different responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maynard Smith|first1=John|author1link=John Maynard Smith|last2=Harper|first2=David|title=Animal Signals|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19852-685-8|pages=113–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improved vigilance===

[[File:Circus hudsonius Recurvirostra americana.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4&lt;!--width for low image--&gt;|A raptor, a [[Circus hudsonius|northern harrier]], chases up an alert flock of [[Recurvirostra americana|American avocets]].]]

In the improved vigilance effect, groups are able to detect predators sooner than solitary individuals.{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=115–149}} For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, [[Common wood pigeon|wood pigeon]] flocks are preyed upon by [[goshawk]]s. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, the more likely it is that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, the rest of the pigeons follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(73)90184-7|pmid=4734745|author=Pulliam, H. R.|title=On the advantages of flocking|volume=38|year=1973|journal=J. Theor. Biol.|pages=419–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild [[ostrich]]es in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises its head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1016/S0003-3472(80)80030-3|title=Vigilance and group size in ostriches|journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=28|issue=1|pages=278–286|author=Bertram, Brian C. |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zebras Serengeti.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2&lt;!--size for low image--&gt;|A single [[zebra]] is hard to catch amongst a herd.]]

===Predator confusion===

Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The [[zebra]] has been suggested by the zoologist [[Martin Stevens (biologist)|Martin Stevens]] and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering [[motion dazzle]] effect in the eye of the predator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-9-81|title=Motion dazzle and camouflage as distinct anti-predator defenses|pmid=22117898 | volume=9|pmc=3257203|year=2011|journal=BMC Biol.|pages=81 | last1 = Stevens | first1 = M | last2 = Searle | first2 = WT | last3 = Seymour | first3 = JE | last4 = Marshall | first4 = KL | last5 = Ruxton | first5 = GD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fighting back==

Defensive structures such as spines may be used both to ward off attack as already mentioned, and if need be to fight back against a predator.&lt;ref name="Vincent1986"/&gt; Methods of fighting back include chemical defences,{{sfn|Ruxton|Sherratt|Speed|2004|pages=64–69}} mobbing,&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt; defensive regurgitation,&lt;ref name="Warham, John 1977"/&gt; and suicidal altruism.&lt;ref name="Davidson, D.W. 2011"/&gt;

===Chemical defences===

Some prey animals are able to eject noxious materials to deter predators actively.

[[File:MuskOxen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7&lt;!--size for very low image--&gt;|Group of [[muskox]]en in defensive formation, horns ready, and highly alert]]

In communal defence, prey groups actively defend themselves by grouping together, and sometimes by attacking or mobbing a predator, rather than allowing themselves to be passive victims of predation. [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|Mobbing]] is the harassing of a predator by many prey animals. Mobbing is usually done to protect the young in social colonies. For example, [[red colobus]] monkeys exhibit mobbing when threatened by [[chimpanzees]], a common predator. The male red colobus monkeys group together and place themselves between predators and the group's females and juveniles. The males jump together and actively bite the chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Stanford | first1=Craig B | title=The influence of chimpanzee predation on group size and anti-predator behavior in red colobus monkeys | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=49 | issue=3| pages=577–587 | doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)90033-0| year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fieldfares]] are birds which may nest either solitarily or in colonies.

===Defensive regurgitation===

===Autotomy===
{{main article|Autotomy}}
[[File:Lizard tail autotomy.JPG|thumb|[[Lizard]] tail [[autotomy]] can distract predators, continuing to writhe while the lizard makes its escape.]]

Some animals are capable of [[autotomy]] (self-amputation), shedding one of their own [[appendage]]s in a last-ditch attempt to elude a predator's grasp or to distract the predator and thereby allow escape. The lost body part may be [[regeneration (biology)|regenerated]] later. Certain [[sea slug]]s discard stinging papillae; arthropods such as [[crab]]s can sacrifice a claw, which can be regrown over several successive moults; among [[vertebrate]]s, many [[gecko]]s and other [[lizard]]s shed their tails when attacked: the tail goes on writhing for a while, distracting the predator, and giving the lizard time to escape; a smaller tail slowly regrows.{{sfn|Edmunds|1974|pages=179–181}}

==History of observations==

[[Aristotle]] recorded observations (around 350 BC) of the antipredator behaviour of [[cephalopod]]s in his ''[[History of Animals]]'', including the use of ink as a distraction, camouflage, and signalling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |authorlink=Aristotle |title=The History of Animals |date=1910 |origyear=350 BC |volume=IX |pages=621b-622a |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/history_anim.9.ix.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, [[Hugh Cott]] wrote a compendious study of camouflage, mimicry, and aposematism, ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]''.{{sfn|Cott|1940}}

'''Aung San Suu Kyi''' ({{IPAc-en|aʊ|ŋ|ˌ|s|æ|n|.|s|uː|ˈ|tʃ|iː}}; {{MYname|MY=အောင်ဆန်းစုကြည်|MLCTS=aung hcan: cu. krany}} {{IPA-my|àʊɴ sʰáɴ sṵ tɕì}}; born 19 June 1945) is a [[Myanmar|Burmese]] politician, diplomat, author, and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate (1991). She is the leader of the [[National League for Democracy]] and the first and incumbent [[State Counsellor of Myanmar|State Counsellor]], a position akin to a prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41139319|title=Johnson warns Suu Kyi over Rohingya|date=3 September 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also the [[List of female foreign ministers|first woman]] to serve as Minister for [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Myanmar)|Foreign Affairs]], for the [[Office of the President of Myanmar|President's Office]], for Electric Power and Energy, and for [[Ministry of Education (Myanmar)|Education]]. From 2012 to 2016 she was an [[member of parliament|MP]] for [[Kawhmu Township]] to the [[House of Representatives (Myanmar)|House of Representatives]].

The youngest daughter of [[Aung San]], [[Father of the Nation]] of modern-day Myanmar, and [[Khin Kyi]], Aung San Suu Kyi was born in [[Yangon|Rangoon]], [[British rule in Burma|British Burma]]. After graduating from the [[University of Delhi]] in 1964 and the [[University of Oxford]] in 1968, she worked at the [[United Nations]] for three years. She married [[Michael Aris]] in 1972, with whom she had two children. Aung San Suu Kyi rose to prominence in the [[8888 Uprising|1988 Uprisings]], and became the General Secretary of the [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD), which she had newly formed with the help of several retired army officials who criticized the military junta. In the [[Burmese general election, 1990|1990 elections]], NLD won 81% of the seats in Parliament, but the results were nullified, as the [[State Peace and Development Council|military]] refused to hand over power, resulting in an international outcry. She had, however, already been detained under [[house arrest]] before the elections. She remained under house arrest for almost 15 of the 21 years from 1989 to 2010, becoming one of the world's most prominent [[political prisoner]]s.

Her party boycotted the [[Myanmar general election, 2010|2010 elections]], resulting in a decisive victory for the military-backed [[Union Solidarity and Development Party]]. Aung San Suu Kyi became a [[Pyithu Hluttaw]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] while her party won 43 of the 45 vacant seats in the [[Burmese by-elections, 2012|2012 by-elections]]. In the [[Myanmar general election, 2015|2015 elections]], her party won a [[landslide victory]], taking 86% of the seats in the [[Assembly of the Union]] – well more than the 67 percent [[supermajority]] needed to ensure that its preferred candidates were elected [[President of Myanmar|President]] and [[Vice President of Myanmar|Second Vice President]] in the [[Presidential Electoral College]]. Although she was prohibited from becoming the President due to a clause in [[Constitution of Myanmar|the constitution]] – her late husband and children are foreign citizens – she assumed the newly created role of [[State Counsellor of Myanmar|State Counsellor]], a role akin to a [[Prime Minister of Myanmar|Prime Minister]] or a [[head of government]]. Aung San Suu Kyi's honours include the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], which she won in 1991. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' named her one of the "Children of Gandhi" and his spiritual heir to non-violence.&lt;ref name="TimeTCOG"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,993026,00.html|title=The Children of Gandhi|date=31 December 1999|work=Time|format=excerpt|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005013134/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C993026%2C00.html|archivedate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ascending to the office of State Counsellor, Aung San Suu Kyi has drawn criticism from many countries, organisations and figures over her inaction to the [[2016 Rohingya persecution in Myanmar|persecution of the Rohingya people]] in [[Rakhine State]] and refusal to accept that Myanmar's military has committed massacres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/world/asia/aung-san-suu-kyi-myanmar.html|title=Did the World Get Aung San Suu Kyi Wrong?|first1=Amanda|last1=Taub|first2=Max|last2=Fisher|date=31 October 2017|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/02/what-happened-to-myanmars-human-rights-icon|title=What Happened to Myanmar's Human-Rights Icon?|first=Hannah|last=Beech|date=25 September 2017|publisher=|via=www.newyorker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/on-demand/67615-001|title=Dispatches - On Demand - All 4|website=www.channel4.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrJ7FgNyTNbhNAA3RtXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTByOHZyb21tBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1530149261/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2fentry%2fmyanmar-suu-kyi-rohingya-genocide_us_5ab14dd7e4b008c9e5f1fc90/RK=2/RS=g1Tivi.NDd5FfxVlfFFrf5LyFn4-|title=rohingya genocide|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, 12 November 2018 [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/nov/12/aung-san-suu-kyi-amnesty-highest-honour-shameful-betrayal amnesty betrayal]&lt;/ref&gt; Under her leadership, Myanmar has also drawn international criticism for prosecutions of journalists.

==Personal life==
[[File:Khin Kyi and family.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A portrait of Khin Kyi and her family in 1948. Aung San Suu Kyi is seated on the floor.]]
Aung San Suu Kyi was born on 19 June 1945 in Rangoon (now [[Yangon]]), British Burma. According to Peter Popham, she was born in a small village outside Rangoon called Hmway Saung.&lt;ref name="Popham"&gt;{{cite book |last=Popham |first=Peter |date=April 2013 |title=The Lady and the Peacock: The Life of Aung San Suu Kyi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yCL1drLmsmQC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;q=%22hmway%20saung%22 |location=New York, NY |publisher=The Experiment, LLC |page=163 |isbn=978-1-61519-081-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, [[Aung San]], founded the [[Tatmadaw|modern Burmese army]] and negotiated Burma's independence from the [[British Empire]] in 1947; he was [[Burmese Martyrs' Day|assassinated by his rivals]] in the same year. She grew up with her mother, [[Khin Kyi]], and two brothers, Aung San Lin and [[Aung San Oo]], in Rangoon. Aung San Lin died at the age of eight, when he drowned in an ornamental lake on the grounds of [[Bogyoke Aung San Museum|the house]].&lt;ref name="Nobel.org" /&gt; Her elder brother emigrated to [[San Diego]], California, becoming a [[Citizenship in the United States|United States citizen]].&lt;ref name="Nobel.org" /&gt; After Aung San Lin's death, the family moved to [[54 University Avenue|a house]] by [[Inya Lake]] where Aung San Suu Kyi met people of various backgrounds, political views and religions.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart (1997), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; She was educated in [[Basic Education High School No. 1 Dagon|Methodist English High School]] (now Basic Education High School No. 1 Dagon) for much of her childhood in Burma, where she was noted as having a talent for learning languages.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart (1997), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; She speaks four languages: Burmese, English, French and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Aung San Suu Kyi: A Biography, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; She is a [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhist]].

[[File:Aung San Suu Kyi 1951.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Aung San Suu Kyi at the age of 6]]

In 1988, Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Burma, at first to tend for her ailing mother but later to lead the pro-democracy movement. Aris' visit in Christmas 1995 turned out to be the last time that he and Aung San Suu Kyi met, as Aung San Suu Kyi remained in Burma and the Burmese dictatorship denied him any further entry visas.&lt;ref name = "azjarp" /&gt; Aris was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] in 1997 which was later found to be [[terminal illness|terminal]]. Despite appeals from prominent figures and organizations, including the United States, UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] and [[Pope John Paul II]], the Burmese government would not grant Aris a [[visa (document)|visa]], saying that they did not have the facilities to care for him, and instead urged Aung San Suu Kyi to leave the country to visit him. She was at that time temporarily free from [[house arrest]] but was unwilling to depart, fearing that she would be refused re-entry if she left, as she did not trust the [[military junta]]'s assurance that she could return.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/304497.stm Suu Kyi rejects UK visit offer].

==Political career==

===Political beginning===
Coincidentally, when Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Burma in 1988, the long-time military leader of Burma and head of the [[Burma Socialist Programme Party|ruling party]], General [[Ne Win]], stepped down. Mass demonstrations for democracy followed that event on 8 August 1988 (8–8–88, a day seen as auspicious), which were violently suppressed in what came to be known as the [[8888 Uprising]]. On 26 August 1988, she addressed half a million people at a mass rally in front of the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] in the capital, calling for a democratic government.&lt;ref name="azjarp" /&gt; However, in September, a [[State Peace and Development Council|new military junta]] took power.

Offered freedom if she left the country, she refused. Despite her philosophy of non-violence, a group of ex-military commanders and senior politicians who joined NLD during the crisis believed that she was too confrontational and left NLD. However, she retained enormous popularity and support among NLD youths with whom she spent most of her time.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite journal | title=Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar: A Review of the Lady's Biographies | author=Kyaw Yin Hlaing | journal=Contemporary Southeast Asia: A Journal of International &amp; Strategic Affairs |date=August 2007  | volume=29 | issue=2 | page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her time under house arrest, Aung San Suu Kyi devoted herself to Buddhist meditation practices and to studying Buddhist thought. This deeper interest in Buddhism is reflected in her writings as more emphasis is put on love and compassion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Voice of Hope: Conversations with Alan Clements | author=Aung San Suu Kyi | publisher=Seven Stories Press | year=1998 | page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also emerged more discussion on the compatibility of democracy and Buddhism and the ability of gaining freedom from an authoritarian government through Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Buddhist Political Rhetoric of Aung San Suu Kyi | author=Stephen McCarthy | journal=Contemporary Buddhism |year=2004 | volume=5 | page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the crisis, the previous democratically elected Prime Minister of Burma, [[U Nu]], initiated to form an interim government and invited opposition leaders to join him. Indian Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] had signaled his readiness to recognize the interim government. However, Aung San Suu Kyi categorically rejected U Nu's plan by saying "the future of the opposition would be decided by masses of the people". Ex-Brigadier General [[Aung Gyi]], another influential politician at the time of the 8888 crisis and the first chairman in the history of the NLD, followed the suit and rejected the plan after Aung San Suu Kyi's refusal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Aung San Suu Kyi: Between Biographical Myth and Hard Realities | author=Susanne Prager-Nyein | journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia |date=February 2013 | volume=3 | issue=43 | pages=546–554 | doi=10.1080/00472336.2013.771942}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aung Gyi later accused several NLD members of being communists and resigned from the party.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

===1990 general election and Nobel Peace Prize===
In 1990, the military junta called a [[Burmese general election, 1990|general election]], in which the National League for Democracy (NLD) received 59% of the votes, guaranteeing NLD 80% of the parliament seats. Some{{who|date=July 2017}} claim that Aung San Suu Kyi would have assumed the office of Prime Minister;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://women.amnestyusa.org/defenders/aungsansuukyi.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821052840/http://women.amnestyusa.org/defenders/aungsansuukyi.asp |archivedate=21 August 2006|title=Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Burma's Icon of Democracy, Hope and Grace Under Pressure |publisher=Amnesty International Women's Action Council Stop Violence Against Women Campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt; in fact, however, as she was not permitted {{clarify|date=July 2017}}, she did not stand as a candidate in the elections (although being a member of parliament is not a strict prerequisite for becoming [[prime minister]] in most parliamentary systems {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}). Instead, the results were nullified and the military refused to hand over power, resulting in an international outcry. Aung San Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest at her home on University Avenue ({{Coord|16|49|32|N|96|9|1|E|region:MM_type:landmark}}) in Rangoon, during which time she was awarded the [[Sakharov Prize]] for Freedom of Thought in 1990, and the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] the year after. Her sons [[Alexander Aris|Alexander]] and Kim accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf. Aung San Suu Kyi used the Nobel Peace Prize's 1.3&amp;nbsp;million USD prize money to establish a health and education trust for the Burmese people.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2001), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, Aung San Suu Kyi chose [[non-violence]] as an expedient political tactic, stating in 2007, "I do not hold to non-violence for moral reasons, but for political and practical reasons."&lt;ref name="tactic"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/27/aung-san-suu-kyi-reith |title=Is Aung San Suu Kyi rethinking her tactics? |last=Simpson |first=John |work=The Guardian |date=27 June 2011 |accessdate=27 June 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1991. The decision of the Nobel Committee mentions:&lt;ref name="Nobel"&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1991/press.html Nobel Committee press release].&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996 attack===
On 9 November 1996, the [[motorcade]] that Aung San Suu Kyi was traveling in with other [[National League for Democracy]] leaders [[Tin Oo]] and [[Kyi Maung]], was attacked in Yangon. About 200 men swooped down on the motorcade, wielding metal chains, metal batons, stones and other weapons. The car that Aung San Suu Kyi was in had its rear window smashed, and the car with Tin Oo and Kyi Maung had its rear window and two backdoor windows shattered. It is believed the offenders were members of the [[Union Solidarity and Development Association]] (USDA) who were allegedly paid 500 [[kyat]]s (@ USD $0.50) each to participate. The NLD lodged an official complaint with the police, and according to reports the government launched an investigation, but no action was taken.

===House arrest===
Aung San Suu Kyi was placed under [[house arrest]] for a total of 15 years over a 21-year period, on numerous occasions, since she began her political career,&lt;ref name=sk&gt;Moe, Wait (3 August 2009). [http://www2.irrawaddy.org/highlight.php?art_id=16470 Suu Kyi Questions Burma's Judiciary, Constitution]. ''[[The Irrawaddy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; during which time she was prevented from meeting her party supporters and international visitors. In an interview, she said that while under house arrest she spent her time reading philosophy, politics and biographies that her husband had sent her.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZFpURJGv00&amp;feature=related Aung San Suu Kyi interview (video)].

''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although under house arrest, Aung San Suu Kyi was granted permission to leave Burma under the condition that she never return, which she refused: "As a mother, the greater sacrifice was giving up my sons, but I was always aware of the fact that others had given up more than me. I never forget that my colleagues who are in prison suffer not only physically, but mentally for their families who have no security outside- in the larger prison of Burma under authoritarian rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Voice of Hope: Conversations with Alan Clements|author=Aung San Suu Kyi|year=1998|publisher=Seven Stories Press|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her loyalty to the people of Burma and her solidarity with those imprisoned for their pro-democratic acts have earned her deep respect among the Burmese people.

The media were also prevented from visiting Aung San Suu Kyi, as occurred in 1998 when journalist [[Maurizio Giuliano]], after photographing her, was stopped by customs officials who then confiscated all his films, tapes and some notes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=BBAB&amp;d_place=BBAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F98E4ECFAA2A5EF&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Burma expels Italian reporter for "illegal reporting], TV Myanmar, Rangoon, 18 August 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Aung San Suu Kyi did have visits from government representatives, such as during her autumn 1994 house arrest when she met the leader of Burma, General [[Than Shwe]] and General [[Khin Nyunt]] on 20 September in the first meeting since she had been placed in detention.&lt;ref name="azjarp" /&gt; On several occasions during her house arrest, she had periods of poor health and as a result was hospitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nick |last=Wadhams|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/09/AR2006060901000.html |title=Myanmar's Suu Kyi Hospitalized |agency=Associated Press |work=The Washington Post |date=9 June 2006 |accessdate=9 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burmese government detained and kept Aung San Suu Kyi imprisoned because it viewed her as someone "likely to undermine the community peace and stability" of the country, and used both Article 10(a) and 10(b) of the 1975 State Protection Act (granting the government the power to imprison people for up to five years without a trial),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=5798 Opposition Condemns Extension of Suu Kyi's Detention], The Irrawaddy, 27 May 2006.

===United Nations involvement===
The United Nations (UN) has attempted to facilitate dialogue between the [[military junta|junta]] and Aung San Suu Kyi.&lt;ref name = "azjarp"/&gt; On 6 May 2002, following secret confidence-building negotiations led by the UN, the government released her; a government spokesman said that she was free to move "because we are confident that we can trust each other". Aung San Suu Kyi proclaimed "a new dawn for the country".

The results from the UN facilitation have been mixed; [[Razali Ismail]], UN special envoy to Burma, met with Aung San Suu Kyi.

The United Nations Working Group for Arbitrary Detention published an Opinion that Aung San Suu Kyi's deprivation of liberty was arbitrary and in contravention of Article 9 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] 1948, and requested that the authorities in Burma set her free, but the authorities ignored the request at that time.&lt;ref name="unWrkGrp"&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/wgad/9-2004.html Daw Aung San Suu Kyi v. Myanmar], U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, U.N. Doc. E/CN.4/2005/6/Add.1 at 47 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The U.N. report said that according to the Burmese Government's reply, "Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has not been arrested, but has only been taken into protective custody, for her own safety", and while "it could have instituted legal action against her under the country's domestic legislation&amp;nbsp; ... it has preferred to adopt a magnanimous attitude, and is providing her with protection in her own interests".&lt;ref name="unWrkGrp" /&gt;

Such claims were rejected by Brig-General [[Khin Yi]], Chief of [[Myanmar Police Force]] (MPF). On 18 January 2007, the [[State media|state-run]] paper ''[[New Light of Myanmar]]'' accused Suu Kyi of [[tax evasion]] for spending her Nobel Prize money outside the country. The accusation followed the defeat of a US-sponsored [[United Nations Security Council]] resolution condemning Burma as a threat to international security; the resolution was defeated because of strong opposition from China, which has strong ties with the military junta (China later voted against the resolution, along with Russia and South Africa).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/19/world/asia/19myanmar.html |title=Burmese Daily at Odds With Democracy Advocate |author=Mydans, Seth |accessdate=19 January 2007 |date=18 January 2008 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, it was reported that Aung San Suu Kyi would meet her political allies [[National League for Democracy]] along with a government minister. The ruling junta made the official announcement on state TV and radio just hours after UN special envoy [[Ibrahim Gambari]] ended his second visit to Burma. The NLD confirmed that it had received the invitation to hold talks with Suu Kyi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7085292.stm |title=Suu Kyi to meet party colleagues|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 November 2007|date=8 November 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071109163856/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7085292.stm| archivedate= 9 November 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the process delivered few concrete results.

On 3 July 2009, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] went to Burma to pressure the junta into releasing Aung San Suu Kyi and to institute democratic reform. However, on departing from Burma, Ban Ki-moon said he was "disappointed" with the visit after junta leader [[Than Shwe]] refused permission for him to visit Aung San Suu Kyi, citing her ongoing trial. Ban said he was "deeply disappointed that they have missed a very important opportunity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Heilprin |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/05/un-chief-leaves-myanmar-039disappointed039-with-junta.html |title=UN chief leaves Myanmar 'disappointed' with junta |work=The Jakarta Post |date=5 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714054213/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/05/un-chief-leaves-myanmar-039disappointed039-with-junta.html |archivedate=14 July 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions were held between Suu Kyi and the Burmese government during 2011, which led to a number of official gestures to meet her demands. In October, around a tenth of Burma's political prisoners were freed in an amnesty and trade unions were legalised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burma frees dozens of political prisoners|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15269259|accessdate=19 November 2011|publisher=BBC News|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burma law to allow labour unions and strikes|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15303968|accessdate=19 November 2011|publisher=BBC News|date=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, there was speculation that Aung San Suu Kyi would run in the [[Burmese by-elections, 2012|2012 national by-elections]] to fill vacant seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2011/news/605/news3160510.html |title=Daw Aung San Suu Kyi eyes Kawhmu seat |last=Kyaw Hsu Mon |date=12 December 2011 |work=The Myanmar Times |accessdate=19 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617095643/http://www.mmtimes.com/2011/news/605/news3160510.html |archivedate=17 June 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 January 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi formally registered to contest a [[Pyithu Hluttaw]] (lower house) seat in the [[Kawhmu Township]] constituency in special parliamentary elections to be held on 1 April 2012.&lt;ref name="irr"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=22880 |title=Suu Kyi Registers for By-Election |last=Aye Aye Win |date=19 January 2012 |work=The Irrawaddy |accessdate=19 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119153239/http://irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=22880 |archivedate=19 January 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16606608|title=Aung San Suu Kyi registers for Burma election run|date=18 January 2012|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seat was previously held by Soe Tint, who vacated it after being appointed Construction Deputy Minister, in the [[Burmese general election, 2010|2010 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altsean.org/Research/Parliament%20Watch/By-elections.php#Kawmoo |title=By-elections Special |work=Alternative Asean Network on Burma |accessdate=7 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316061347/http://www.altsean.org/Research/Parliament%20Watch/By-elections.php |archivedate=16 March 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; She ran against [[Union Solidarity and Development Party]] candidate Soe Min, a retired army physician and native of [[Twante Township]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/myanmar-old-soldier-fights-losing-war-against-suu-024936554.html |title=In Myanmar, old soldier fights losing war against Suu Kyi |last=Marshall |first=Andrew |date=24 March 2012 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=26 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328095551/http://news.yahoo.com/myanmar-old-soldier-fights-losing-war-against-suu-024936554.html |archivedate=28 March 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March 2012, at a large campaign rally in [[Mandalay]], Aung San Suu Kyi unexpectedly left after 15 minutes, because of exhaustion and airsickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/asia/malaysia/2012/03/04/333555/Myanmars-opposition.htm|title=Myanmar's opposition leader Suu Kyi falls ill at election rally, recovers|date=4 March 2012|agency=Associated Press|work=China Post |location=Taiwan (ROC)|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an official campaign speech broadcast on Burmese state television's [[MRTV]] on 14 March 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi publicly campaigned for reform of the [[Constitution of Burma|2008 Constitution]], removal of restrictive laws, more adequate protections for people's democratic rights, and establishment of an independent judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17363329|title=Burma's Aung San Suu Kyi makes landmark campaign speech|date=14 March 2012|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech was leaked online a day before it was broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=23204 |title=Suu Kyi's Speech Leaked on Internet Before Broadcast |date=13 March 2012 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=The Irrawaddy |accessdate=15 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314141429/http://irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=23204 |archivedate=14 March 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A paragraph in the speech, focusing on the [[Tatmadaw]]'s repression by means of law, was censored by authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mizzima.com/news/inside-burma/6738-burmese-govt-censors-suu-kyis-campaign-speech.html |title=Burmese gov't censors Suu Kyi's campaign speech |date=11 March 2012 |work=Mizzima |accessdate=15 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315011133/http://mizzima.com/news/inside-burma/6738-burmese-govt-censors-suu-kyis-campaign-speech.html |archivedate=15 March 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suu Kyi has also called for international media to monitor the upcoming by-elections, while publicly pointing out irregularities in official voter lists, which include deceased individuals and exclude other eligible voters in the contested constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=23175 |title=Suu Kyi Warns Canadian FM of Voter List Problems |date=9 March 2012 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=The Irrawaddy |accessdate=15 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314154319/http://irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=23175 |archivedate=14 March 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5ghDxCYw0UlDzCnPQ4M7DGRtg8POg?docId=N1041441331491159890A|title=Suu Kyi: media must monitor Burma|date=11 March 2012|work=UK Press Association|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 March 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi was quoted as saying "Fraud and rule violations are continuing and we can even say they are increasing."&lt;ref name="rfa"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/burma/election-03212012170629.html|title=Western Election Observers Invited|date=21 March 2012|work=Radio Free Asia|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked whether she would assume a ministerial post if given the opportunity, she said the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/29/myanmar-suukyi-cabinet-idUSL2E8DT3G720120229|title=Myanmar's Suu Kyi says reforms could be reversed|last=Ljunggren|first=David|date=29 February 2012|agency=Reuters|accessdate=15 March 2012|location=Ottawa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 March 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi suspended her nationwide campaign tour early, after a campaign rally in [[Myeik, Burma|Myeik]] (Mergui), a coastal town in the south, citing health problems due to exhaustion and hot weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/25/suu-kyi-suspends-burma-election-tour?newsfeed=true|title=Aung San Suu Kyi suspends Burma election tour after falling ill|date=26 March 2012|work=The Guardian |agency=Associated Press|accessdate=26 March 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 2012, the NLD announced that Aung San Suu Kyi had won the vote for a seat in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-17577620|title=Burma's Aung San Suu Kyi wins by-election: NLD party|date=1 April 2012|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A news broadcast on state-run [[MRTV]], reading the announcements of the [[Union Election Commission]], confirmed her victory, as well as her party's victory in 43 of the 45 contested seats, officially making Aung San Suu Kyi the [[Opposition (Myanmar)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the [[Assembly of the Union|Pyidaungsu Hluttaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JO0jM7ymHE0|title=Winning NLD candidate list announced in state tv|last=Kyaw Myo Win|date=2 April 2012|publisher=MRTV|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although she and other MP-elects were expected to take office on 23 April when the Hluttaws resumed session, National League for Democracy MP-elects, including Aung San Suu Kyi, said they might not take their oaths because of its wording; in its present form, parliamentarians must vow to "safeguard" the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/20/us-myanmar-idUSBRE83J0AI20120420|title=Suu Kyi Myanmar parliament debut in doubt over oath stalemate|author=Aung Hla Tun|date=20 April 2012|agency=Reuters|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The line in question is Schedule Four of the 2008 Constitution (Form of Oaths or Affirmation), which states: "After being elected as an MP, I do solemnly swear to preserve, protect, and nurture the Constitution while following the nation's laws."

Although she was awarded this medal in 2008, at the time she was under house arrest, and was unable to receive the medal. Aung San Suu Kyi was greeted with bipartisan support at Congress, as part of a coast-to-coast tour in the United States. In addition, Aung San Suu Kyi met President [[Barack Obama]] at the [[White House]]. The experience was described by Aung San Suu Kyi as "one of the most moving days of my life."&lt;ref name="CGM"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19651683 | title=Burma's Aung San Suu Kyi given US Congressional medal | date=19 September 2012 | accessdate=20 September 2012 | publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters Obama"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/20/us-usa-myanmar-suukyi-obama-idUSBRE88I0VM20120920 | title=Suu Kyi meets Obama, receives medal from Congress | agency=Reuters | date=19 September 2012 | accessdate=20 September 2012 | author=Spetalnick, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, she was listed as the 61st most powerful woman in the world by ''Forbes''.&lt;ref name=Forbes14&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's 100 Most Powerful Women|url=https://www.forbes.com/power-women/list/2/#tab:overall|work=Forbes|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN17350334|title=Canada makes Myanmar's Suu Kyi an honorary citizen|accessdate=28 December 2010|date=17 October 2007|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theismaili.org/cms/732/Update-Mawlana-Hazar-Imam-is-made-an-honorary-citizen-of-Canada|title=Update: Mawlana Hazar Imam is made an honorary citizen of Canada|publisher=The Ismaili|date=19 June 2009|accessdate=28 December 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110104102035/http://www.theismaili.org/cms/732/Update-Mawlana-Hazar-Imam-is-made-an-honorary-citizen-of-Canada| archivedate= 4 January 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallenberg Medal"&gt;[http://www.wallenberg.umich.edu/recipients.html Recipients of the Wallenberg Medal].

The NLD won a sweeping victory in those elections, winning at least 255 seats in the House of Representatives and 135 seats in the House of Nationalities. In addition, Aung San Suu Kyi won re-election to the House of Representatives. Under the 2008 constitution, the NLD needed to win at least a two-thirds majority in both houses to ensure that its candidate would become president. Before the elections, Aung San Suu Kyi announced that even though she is constitutionally barred from the presidency, she would hold the real power in any NLD-led government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy Wins Majority in Myanmar |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34805806 |accessdate=13 November 2015 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 March 2016 she became Minister for the President's Office, for Foreign Affairs, for Education and for Electric Power and Energy in President [[Htin Kyaw]]'s government; later she relinquished the latter two ministries and President Htin Kyaw appointed her [[State Counsellor (Myanmar)|State Counsellor]], a position akin to a [[Prime Minister of Myanmar|Prime Minister]] created especially for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/burmese/burma/2016/03/160321_dassk_foreign_minister|title=ဒေါ်စု နိုင်ငံခြားရေးဝန်ကြီး ဖြစ်လာမလား|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VOA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://editorials.voa.gov/content/burmese-parliamentary-elections-146265885/1493313.html |title=Burmese Parliamentary Elections |date=4 April 2012 |publisher=Voice of America News |accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NLD Claims Suu Kyi Victory"&gt;[http://www.irrawaddy.org/archives/1661 NLD Claims Suu Kyi Victory], The Irrawaddy, 4 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, her role as State Counsellor was established.

===Foreign Minister and State Counsellor (2016–present)===

As soon as she became foreign minister, she invited Chinese Foreign Minister [[Wang Yi (politician)|Wang Yi]], Canadian Foreign Minister [[Stephane Dion]] and Italian Foreign Minister [[Paolo Gentiloni]] in April and Japanese Foreign Minister [[Fumio Kishida]] in May and discussed to have good diplomatic relationships with these countries.{{citation needed|date= May 2016}}

Initially, upon accepting the State Counsellor position, she granted amnesty to the students who were arrested for opposing the [[Myanmar National Education Law 2014|National Education Bill]], and announced a creation of the commission on [[Rakhine state]], which had a long record of persecution of the Muslim [[Rohingya]] minority. However, soon Aung San Suu Kyi's government did not manage with the ethnic conflicts in [[Shan state|Shan]] and [[Kachin state]]s, where thousands of refugees fled to China, and by 2017 the [[2017 Rohingya persecution in Myanmar|persecution of the Rohingya by the government forces]] escalated to the point that it is not uncommonly called a genocide. Aung San Suu Kyi, when interviewed, has denied the allegations of ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/31/aung-san-suu-kyi-myanmars-great-hope-fails-to-live-up-to-expectations|title=Aung San Suu Kyi: Myanmar's great hope fails to live up to expectations|last=McPherson|first=Poppy|date=31 March 2017|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-39510271|title=Myanmar: Aung San Suu Kyi exclusive interview|last=Keane|first=Fergal|date=5 April 2017|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also refused to grant citizenship to the Rohingya, instead taking steps to issue ID cards for residency but no guarantees of citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-myanmar-rohingya-2017-story.html|title=Myanmar's long-suffering Rohingya Muslims hoped that Aung San Suu Kyi would make them full citizens.

Her tenure as State Counsellor of Myanmar has drawn international criticism for her failure to address her country's economic and ethnic problems, particularly the plight of the [[Rohingya]] following the [[Northern Rakhine State clashes#25 August 2017 ARSA attacks|25 August 2017 ARSA attacks]] (described as "certainly one of the biggest refugee crises and cases of ethnic cleansing since the [[second world war]]"), for the weakening of [[freedom of the press]] and for her style of leadership, described as imperious and "distracted and out of touch".&lt;ref name="veconomist5" &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Is the world getting Myanmar wrong?|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21730684-future-not-long-ago-deemed-bright-now-feels-bleak-world-getting-myanmar-wrong|work=[[The Economist]]|date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press freedom is waning in Myanmar|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21738413-no-law-too-obscure-tool-silence-awkward-journalists-press-freedom-waning-myanmar|accessdate=9 March 2018|work=[[The Economist]]|date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 BBC News article, reporter [[Jonah Fisher]] suggested that Aung San Suu Kyi's silence over the Rohingya issue is due to a need to obtain support from the majority [[Bamar people|Bamar]] ethnicity as she is in "the middle of [[Myanma general election, 2015|a general election]] campaign".&lt;ref name="bbcfisher"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-32974061|title=Aung San Suu Kyi: Where are you?|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] publicly called upon her to do more to help the Rohingya in Myanmar, claiming that he had previously urged her to address the plight of the Rohingya in private during two separate meetings and that she had resisted his urging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dalai Lama presses Aung San Suu Kyi over Rohingya migrants|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-32925805|accessdate=3 June 2015|publisher=BBC|date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi asked the newly appointed [[United States Ambassador to Myanmar]], [[Scot Marciel]], not to refer to the Rohingya by that name as they "are not recognized as among the 135 official ethnic groups" in Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/07/world/asia/myanmar-rohingya-aung-san-suu-kyi.html?_r=0 | title=Aung San Suu Kyi Asks U.S. Not to Refer to Rohingya | date=6 May 2016 | accessdate=7 May 2016 | publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed [[Bamar people|Bamar]] protests at Marciel's use of the word "Rohingya".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sanctions on Myanmar|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21699166-america-tweaks-sanctions-not-wholly-democratic-country-not-clear-yet|accessdate=20 May 2016|work=The Economist|date=20 May 2016|quote=Suu Kyi unsettled Western diplomats (who not long ago used unequivocally to adore her) when she asked the new American ambassador not to refer to a persecuted Muslim minority by their name, the Rohingyas.

In 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi was accused of failing to protect Myanmar's [[Rohingya people|Rohingya Muslims]] during the [[2016–17 Rohingya persecution in Myanmar|2016–17 persecution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/17/asia/myanmar-rohingya-aung-san-suu-kyi/ Is The Lady listening?

Asked what democratic models Myanmar could look to, she said: "We have many, many lessons to learn from various places, not just the [[Asian countries]] like [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Mongolia]], and [[Indonesia]]." She also cited "the [[eastern European]] countries, which made the transition from communist autocracy to democracy in the 1980s and 1990s, and the [[Latin American]] countries, which made the transition from military governments. "And we cannot of course forget South Africa, because although it wasn't a military regime, it was certainly an authoritarian regime." She added: "We wish to learn from everybody who has achieved a transition to democracy, and also&amp;nbsp; ... our great strong point is that, because we are so far behind everybody else, we can also learn which mistakes we should avoid."&lt;ref name="LA Speech"&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g7jcSqNCiDcId7mEJs9DXzmqzGtA?docId=CNG.a49d8e2a5f23889e2d2987feb130e63f.31 Myanmar's Suu Kyi ends US trip, hailing democracy], AFP, 3 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

McDaniel and Einstein argues that bizarreness intrinsically ''does not'' enhance memory in their paper from 1986. They claim that bizarre information becomes distinctive.

In [[abstract algebra]], a '''Boolean algebra''' or '''Boolean lattice''' is a [[complemented lattice|complemented]] [[distributive lattice]]. This type of [[algebraic structure]] captures essential properties of both [[Set (mathematics)|set]] operations and [[logic]] operations. A Boolean algebra can be seen as a generalization of a [[power set]] algebra or a [[field of sets]], or its elements can be viewed as generalized [[truth value]]s. It is also a special case of a [[De Morgan algebra]] and a [[Kleene algebra (with involution)]].

Every Boolean algebra [[Boolean algebra (structure)#Boolean rings|gives rise]] to a [[Boolean ring]], and vice versa, with ring multiplication corresponding to [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] or [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] ∧, and ring addition to [[exclusive or|exclusive disjunction]] or [[symmetric difference]] (not [[logical disjunction|disjunction]] ∨). However, the theory of Boolean rings has an inherent asymmetry between the two operators, while the axioms and theorems of Boolean algebra express the symmetry of the theory described by the [[Duality principle (Boolean algebra)|duality principle]].&lt;ref&gt;Givant and [[Paul Halmos]], 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;20&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==  &lt;!-- [[Boolean algebra (history)]] redirects here --&gt;

The term "Boolean algebra" honors [[George Boole]] (1815–1864), a self-educated English mathematician. He introduced the [[algebraic system]] initially in a small pamphlet, ''The Mathematical Analysis of Logic'', published in 1847 in response to an ongoing public controversy between [[Augustus De Morgan]] and [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]], and later as a more substantial book, ''[[The Laws of Thought]]'', published in 1854. Boole's formulation differs from that described above in some important respects. For example, conjunction and disjunction in Boole were not a dual pair of operations. Boolean algebra emerged in the 1860s, in papers written by [[William Jevons]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. The first systematic presentation of Boolean algebra and [[distributive lattice]]s is owed to the 1890 ''Vorlesungen'' of [[Ernst Schröder]]. The first extensive treatment of Boolean algebra in English is [[A. N. Whitehead]]'s 1898 ''Universal Algebra''. Boolean algebra as an axiomatic algebraic structure in the modern axiomatic sense begins with a 1904 paper by [[Edward V. Huntington]]. Boolean algebra came of age as serious mathematics with the work of [[Marshall Stone]] in the 1930s, and with [[Garrett Birkhoff]]'s 1940 ''Lattice Theory''. In the 1960s, [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]], [[Dana Scott]], and others found deep new results in [[mathematical logic]] and [[axiomatic set theory]] using offshoots of Boolean algebra, namely [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] and [[Boolean-valued model]]s.

== Definition ==

A '''Boolean algebra''' is a six-[[tuple]] consisting of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'', equipped with two [[binary operation]]s ∧ (called "meet" or "and"), ∨ (called "join" or "or"), a [[unary operation]] ¬ (called "complement" or "not") and two elements 0 and 1 (called "bottom" and "top", or "least" and "greatest" element, also denoted by the symbols ⊥ and ⊤, respectively), such that for all elements ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' of ''A'', the following [[axiom]]s hold:&lt;ref&gt;Davey, Priestley, 1990, p.109, 131, 144&lt;/ref&gt;

::{| cellpadding=5
|''a'' ∨ (''b'' ∨ ''c'') = (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∨ ''c''
|''a'' ∧ (''b'' ∧ ''c'') = (''a'' ∧ ''b'') ∧ ''c''
| [[associativity]]
|-
|''a'' ∨ ''b'' = ''b'' ∨ ''a''
|''a'' ∧ ''b'' = ''b'' ∧ ''a''
| [[commutativity]]
|-
|''a'' ∨ (''a'' ∧ ''b'') = ''a''
|''a'' ∧ (''a'' ∨ ''b'') = ''a''
| [[Absorption law|absorption]]
|-
|''a'' ∨ 0 = ''a''
|''a'' ∧ 1 = ''a''
| [[identity element|identity]]
|-
|''a'' ∨ (''b'' ∧ ''c'') = (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∧ (''a'' ∨ ''c'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|''a'' ∧ (''b'' ∨ ''c'') = (''a'' ∧ ''b'') ∨ (''a'' ∧ ''c'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| [[distributivity]]
|-
|''a'' ∨ ¬''a'' = 1
|''a'' ∧ ¬''a'' = 0
| [[complemented lattice|complements]]
|}
Note, however, that the absorption law and even the associativity law can be excluded from the set of axioms as they can be derived from the other axioms (see [[Boolean algebra (structure)#Axiomatics|Proven properties]]).

A Boolean algebra with only one element is called a '''trivial Boolean algebra''' or a '''degenerate Boolean algebra'''. (Some authors require 0 and 1 to be ''distinct'' elements in order to exclude this case.)

It follows from the last three pairs of axioms above (identity, distributivity and complements), or from the absorption axiom, that
::''a'' = ''b'' ∧ ''a'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if and only if &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''a'' ∨ ''b'' = ''b''.
The relation ≤ defined by ''a'' ≤ ''b'' if these equivalent conditions hold, is a [[partial order]] with least element 0 and greatest element 1. The meet ''a'' ∧ ''b'' and the join ''a'' ∨ ''b'' of two elements coincide with their [[infimum]] and [[supremum]], respectively, with respect to ≤.

The first four pairs of axioms constitute a definition of a [[bounded lattice]].

It follows from the first five pairs of axioms that any complement is unique.

The set of axioms is [[duality (order theory)|self-dual]] in the sense that if one exchanges ∨ with ∧ and 0 with 1 in an axiom, the result is again an axiom. Therefore, by applying this operation to a Boolean algebra (or Boolean lattice), one obtains another Boolean algebra with the same elements; it is called its '''dual'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Boolean Algebra|first=R. L.|last=Goodstein|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2012|isbn=9780486154978|chapter=Chapter 2: The self-dual system of axioms|pages=21ff|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0fxW2KiyxWwC&amp;pg=PA21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

* The simplest non-trivial Boolean algebra, the [[two-element Boolean algebra]], has only two elements, 0 and 1, and is defined by the rules:
{|
|-
| width="70" |
|
{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
|-
! ∧ || 0 || 1
|-
! 0
| 0 || 0
|-
! 1
| 0 || 1
|}
|
| width="30" |
|
{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
|-
! ∨ || 0 || 1

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
|-
! ''a'' || 0 || 1
|-
! ¬''a''
| 1 || 0
|}
|}

:* It has applications in [[logic]], interpreting 0 as ''false'', 1 as ''true'', ∧ as ''and'', ∨ as ''or'', and ¬ as ''not''. Expressions involving variables and the Boolean operations represent statement forms, and two such expressions can be shown to be equal using the above axioms if and only if the corresponding statement forms are [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]].

:* The two-element Boolean algebra is also used for circuit design in [[electrical engineering]]&lt;ref&gt;Strictly, electrical engineers tend to use additional states to represent other circuit conditions such as high impedance - see [[IEEE 1164]] or [[IEEE 1364]].&lt;/ref&gt;; here 0 and 1 represent the two different states of one [[bit]] in a [[digital circuit]], typically high and low [[voltage]]. Circuits are described by expressions containing variables, and two such expressions are equal for all values of the variables if and only if the corresponding circuits have the same input-output behavior. Furthermore, every possible input-output behavior can be modeled by a suitable Boolean expression.

:* The two-element Boolean algebra is also important in the general theory of Boolean algebras, because an equation involving several variables is generally true in all Boolean algebras if and only if it is true in the two-element Boolean algebra (which can be checked by a trivial [[brute force search|brute force]] algorithm for small numbers of variables). This can for example be used to show that the following laws (''Consensus theorems'') are generally valid in all Boolean algebras:
:** (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∧ (¬''a'' ∨ ''c'') ∧ (''b'' ∨ ''c'') ≡ (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∧ (¬''a'' ∨ ''c'')
:** (''a'' ∧ ''b'') ∨ (¬''a'' ∧ ''c'') ∨ (''b'' ∧ ''c'') ≡ (''a'' ∧ ''b'') ∨ (¬''a'' ∧ ''c'')

* The [[power set]] (set of all subsets) of any given nonempty set ''S'' forms a Boolean algebra, an [[algebra of sets]], with the two operations ∨ := ∪ (union) and ∧ := ∩ (intersection). The smallest element 0 is the [[empty set]] and the largest element 1 is the set ''S'' itself.

:* After the two-element Boolean algebra, the simplest Boolean algebra is that defined by the [[power set]] of two atoms:

* The set of all subsets of ''S'' that are either finite or [[cofinite]] is a Boolean algebra, an [[algebra of sets]].
* Starting with the [[propositional calculus]] with κ sentence symbols, form the [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra|Lindenbaum algebra]] (that is, the set of sentences in the propositional calculus modulo [[logical equivalence]]).  This construction yields a Boolean algebra.  It is in fact the [[free Boolean algebra]] on κ generators.  A truth assignment in propositional calculus is then a Boolean algebra homomorphism from this algebra to the two-element Boolean algebra.
* Given any [[linearly ordered]] set ''L'' with a least element, the interval algebra is the smallest algebra of subsets of ''L'' containing all of the half-open intervals [''a'', ''b'') such that ''a'' is in ''L'' and ''b'' is either in ''L'' or equal to ∞.  Interval algebras are useful in the study of [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra]]s; every countable Boolean algebra is isomorphic to an interval algebra.

* For any [[natural number]] ''n'', the set of all positive [[divisor]]s of ''n'', defining ''a''≤''b'' if ''a'' [[divides]] ''b'', forms a [[distributive lattice]]. This lattice is a Boolean algebra if and only if ''n'' is [[square-free integer|square-free]]. The bottom and the top element of this Boolean algebra is the natural number 1 and ''n'', respectively. The complement of ''a'' is given by ''n''/''a''. The meet and the join of ''a'' and ''b'' is given by the [[greatest common divisor]] (gcd) and the [[least common multiple]] (lcm) of ''a'' and ''b'', respectively. The ring addition ''a''+''b'' is given by lcm(''a'',''b'')/gcd(''a'',''b''). The picture shows an example for ''n'' = 30. As a counter-example, considering the non-square-free ''n''=60, the greatest common divisor of 30 and its complement 2 would be 2, while it should be the bottom element 1.
* Other examples of Boolean algebras arise from [[topology|topological spaces]]: if ''X'' is a topological space, then the collection of all subsets of ''X'' which are [[Clopen set|both open and closed]] forms a Boolean algebra with the operations ∨ := ∪ (union) and ∧ := ∩ (intersection).
* If ''R'' is an arbitrary [[mathematical ring|ring]] and we define the set of ''central idempotents'' by &lt;br&gt; ''A'' = { ''e'' ∈ ''R'' : ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e'', ''ex'' = ''xe'', ∀''x'' ∈ ''R'' } &lt;br&gt; then the set ''A'' becomes a Boolean algebra with the operations ''e'' ∨ ''f'' := ''e'' + ''f'' - ''ef'' and ''e'' ∧ ''f'' := ''ef''.

== Homomorphisms and isomorphisms ==
&lt;!-- "Boolean homomorphism" redirects here --&gt;

A ''[[homomorphism]]'' between two Boolean algebras ''A'' and ''B'' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B'' such that for all ''a'', ''b'' in ''A'':

: ''f''(''a'' ∨ ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') ∨ ''f''(''b''),
: ''f''(''a'' ∧ ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') ∧ ''f''(''b''),
: ''f''(0) = 0,
: ''f''(1) = 1.

It then follows that ''f''(¬''a'') = ¬''f''(''a'') for all ''a'' in ''A''. The [[class (set theory)|class]] of all Boolean algebras, together with this notion of morphism, forms a [[full subcategory]] of the [[category theory|category]] of lattices.
&lt;!--The constant function with ''f''(''a'') = 1 for all ''a'' in ''A'' satisfies the first, second, and fourth conditions but not the third (unless ''B'' is the degenerate singleton Boolean algebra with 0 = 1), so it is not a Boolean algebra homomorphism.--&gt;

An ''isomorphism'' between two Boolean algebras ''A'' and ''B'' is a homomorphism ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B'' with an inverse homomorphism, that is, a homomorphism ''g'' : ''B'' → ''A'' such that the [[function composition|composition]] ''g'' ◌ ''f'': ''A'' → ''A'' is the [[identity function]] on ''A'', and the composition ''f'' ◌ ''g'': ''B'' → ''B'' is the identity function on ''B''.  A homomorphism of Boolean algebras is an isomorphism if and only if it is [[bijection|bijective]].

== Boolean rings ==
{{Main article|Boolean ring}}
Every Boolean algebra (A, ∧, ∨) gives rise to a [[ring (algebra)|ring]] (''A'', +, ·) by defining ''a'' + ''b'' := (''a'' ∧ ¬''b'') ∨ (''b'' ∧ ¬''a'') = (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∧ ¬(''a'' ∧ ''b'') (this operation is called [[symmetric difference]] in the case of sets and [[Truth table#Exclusive disjunction|XOR]] in the case of logic) and ''a'' · ''b'' := ''a'' ∧ ''b''. The zero element of this ring coincides with the 0 of the Boolean algebra; the multiplicative identity element of the ring is the 1 of the Boolean algebra. This ring has the property that ''a'' · ''a'' = ''a'' for all ''a'' in ''A''; rings with this property are called [[Boolean ring]]s.

Conversely, if a Boolean ring ''A'' is given, we can turn it into a Boolean algebra by defining ''x'' ∨ ''y'' := ''x'' + ''y'' + (''x'' · ''y'') and ''x'' ∧ ''y'' := ''x'' · ''y''.
&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hsiang, 1985, p.260&lt;/ref&gt;
Since these two constructions are inverses of each other, we can say that every Boolean ring arises from a Boolean algebra, and vice versa. Furthermore, a map ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B'' is a homomorphism of Boolean algebras if and only if it is a homomorphism of Boolean rings. The [[category theory|categories]] of Boolean rings and Boolean algebras are equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cohn|2003}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VESm0MJOiDQC&amp;pg=PA81 p.&amp;nbsp;81].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hsiang (1985) gave a [[Abstract rewriting system|rule-based algorithm]] to [[Word problem (mathematics)|check]] whether two arbitrary expressions denote the same value in every Boolean ring.
&lt;!---probably too much details(?):---
Hsiang (1985) gave a [[Confluence (abstract rewriting)|confluent]] and [[Abstract_rewriting_system#Termination_and_convergence|terminating]] [[Abstract rewriting system|rewrite system]] for Boolean rings, thus solving their [[Word problem (mathematics)|word problem]]: to check whether two arbitrary expressions ''s'' and ''t'' denote the same value in every Boolean ring, apply rewrite rules to ''s'' as long as possible, resulting in an expression ''s''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, obtain ''t''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; from ''t'' in a similar way, and check whether ''s''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are literally identical, except for different parenthezation and order of operands of "+" or "·".
---&gt;
More generally, Boudet, [[Jean-Pierre Jouannaud|Jouannaud]], and Schmidt-Schauß (1989) gave an algorithm to [[Unification (computer science)#Particular background knowledge sets E|solve equations]] between arbitrary Boolean-ring expressions.
Employing the similarity of Boolean rings and Boolean algebras, both algorithms have applications in [[automated theorem proving]].

== Ideals and filters ==
{{Main article|Ideal (order theory)|Filter (mathematics)}}
An ''ideal'' of the Boolean algebra ''A'' is a subset ''I'' such that for all ''x'', ''y'' in ''I'' we have ''x'' ∨ ''y'' in ''I'' and for all ''a'' in ''A'' we have ''a'' ∧ ''x'' in ''I''. This notion of ideal coincides with the notion of [[ring ideal]] in the Boolean ring ''A''. An ideal ''I'' of ''A'' is called ''prime'' if ''I'' ≠ ''A'' and if ''a'' ∧ ''b'' in ''I'' always implies ''a'' in ''I'' or ''b'' in ''I''. Furthermore, for every ''a'' ∈ ''A'' we have that ''a'' ∧ ''-a'' = 0 ∈ ''I'' and then ''a'' ∈ ''I'' or ''-a'' ∈ ''I'' for every ''a'' ∈ ''A'', if ''I'' is prime. An ideal ''I'' of ''A'' is called ''maximal'' if ''I'' ≠ ''A'' and if the only ideal properly containing ''I'' is ''A'' itself. For an ideal ''I'', if ''a'' ∉ ''I'' and ''-a'' ∉ ''I'', then ''I'' ∪ {''a''} or ''I'' ∪ {''-a''} is properly contained in another ideal ''J''. Hence, that an ''I'' is not maximal and therefore the notions of prime ideal and maximal ideal are equivalent in Boolean algebras. Moreover, these notions coincide with ring theoretic ones of [[prime ideal]] and [[maximal ideal]] in the Boolean ring ''A''.

The dual of an ''ideal'' is a ''filter''. A ''filter'' of the Boolean algebra ''A'' is a subset ''p'' such that for all ''x'', ''y'' in ''p'' we have ''x'' ∧ ''y'' in ''p'' and for all ''a'' in ''A'' we have ''a'' ∨ ''x'' in ''p''. The dual of a ''maximal'' (or ''prime'') ''ideal'' in a Boolean algebra is ''[[ultrafilter]]''. Ultrafilters can alternatively be described as [[2-valued morphism]]s from ''A'' to the two-element Boolean algebra. The statement ''every filter in a Boolean algebra can be extended to an ultrafilter'' is called the ''[[Boolean prime ideal theorem#The ultrafilter lemma|Ultrafilter Theorem]]'' and cannot be proven in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]], if [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] is [[consistent]]. Within ZF, it is strictly weaker than the [[axiom of choice]].
The Ultrafilter Theorem has many equivalent formulations: ''every Boolean algebra has an ultrafilter'', ''every ideal in a Boolean algebra can be extended to a prime ideal'', etc.

== Representations ==

It can be shown that every ''finite'' Boolean algebra is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra of all subsets of a finite set.  Therefore, the number of elements of every finite Boolean algebra is a [[power of two]].

[[Marshall H. Stone|Stone's]] celebrated ''[[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras|representation theorem for Boolean algebras]]'' states that ''every'' Boolean algebra ''A'' is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra of all [[clopen set|clopen]] sets in some ([[compact space|compact]] [[totally disconnected]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]) topological space.

The first axiomatization of Boolean lattices/algebras in general was given by the English philosopher and mathematician [[Alfred North Whitehead]] in 1898.&lt;ref name="PadmanabhanRudeanu2008"&gt;Padmanabhan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JlXSlpmlSv4C&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.&amp;nbsp;73]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, 1898, p.37&lt;/ref&gt;
It included the [[#Definition|above axioms]] and additionally ''x''∨1=1 and ''x''∧0=0.
In 1904, the American mathematician [[Edward V. Huntington]] (1874–1952) gave probably the most parsimonious axiomatization based on ∧, ∨, ¬, even proving the associativity laws (see box).&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, 1904, p.292-293, (first of several axiomatizations by Huntington)&lt;/ref&gt;
He also proved that these axioms are [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, 1904, p.296&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1933, Huntington set out the following elegant axiomatization for Boolean algebra.  It requires just one binary operation + and a [[unary functional symbol]] ''n'', to be read as 'complement', which satisfy the following laws:

# ''Commutativity'': ''x'' + ''y'' = ''y'' + ''x''.
# ''Associativity'': (''x'' + ''y'') + ''z'' = ''x'' + (''y'' + ''z'').
# ''Huntington equation'': ''n''(''n''(''x'') + ''y'') + ''n''(''n''(''x'') + ''n''(''y'')) = ''x''.

[[Herbert Robbins]] immediately asked: If the Huntington equation is replaced with its dual, to wit:

:4. ''Robbins Equation'': ''n''(''n''(''x'' + ''y'') + ''n''(''x'' + ''n''(''y''))) = ''x'',

do (1), (2), and (4) form a basis for Boolean algebra? Calling (1), (2), and (4) a ''Robbins algebra'', the question then becomes: Is every Robbins algebra a Boolean algebra? This question (which came to be known as the [[Robbins conjecture]]) remained open for decades, and became a favorite question of [[Alfred Tarski]] and his students. In 1996, [[William McCune]] at [[Argonne National Laboratory]], building on earlier work by Larry Wos, Steve Winker, and Bob Veroff, answered Robbins's question in the affirmative: Every Robbins algebra is a Boolean algebra. Crucial to McCune's proof was the [[automated reasoning program]] [[EQP]] he designed. For a simplification of McCune's proof, see Dahn (1998).

Removing the requirement of existence of a unit from the axioms of Boolean algebra yields "generalized Boolean algebras". Formally, a [[distributive lattice]] ''B'' is a generalized Boolean lattice, if it has a smallest element 0 and for any elements ''a'' and ''b'' in ''B'' such that ''a'' ≤ ''b'', there exists an element ''x'' such that a ∧ x = 0 and a ∨ x = b. Defining a ∖ b as the unique ''x'' such that (a ∧ b) ∨ x = a and (a ∧ b) ∧ x = 0, we say that the structure (B,∧,∨,∖,0) is a ''generalized Boolean algebra'', while (B,∨,0) is a ''generalized Boolean [[semilattice]]''. Generalized Boolean lattices are exactly the [[Ideal (order theory)|ideals]] of Boolean lattices.

A structure that satisfies all axioms for Boolean algebras except the two distributivity axioms is called an [[orthocomplemented lattice]]. Orthocomplemented lattices arise naturally in [[quantum logic]] as lattices of closed subspaces for separable [[Hilbert space]]s.

A '''caffè sospeso''' ({{IPA-it|kafˈfɛ ssoˈspeːso; -eːzo|pron}}; {{langnf||Italian|"suspended coffee"}}) or '''pending coffee''' is a cup of [[coffee]] paid for in advance as an anonymous act of [[Charity (practice)|charity]]. The tradition began in the working-class [[café|café]]s of [[Naples]], where someone who had experienced good luck would order a ''sospeso'', paying the price of two coffees but receiving and consuming only one. A poor person enquiring later whether there was a ''sospeso'' available would then be served a coffee for free.&lt;ref name="theage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sofiaecho"/&gt; Coffee shops in other countries have adopted the sospeso to increase sales, and to promote kindness and caring.

==History==

One 2010 account claims the tradition was over 100 years old, but declined during the [[History of the Italian Republic#The 1950s and 1960s: the Economic Boom|postwar economic boom]], so that it is mainly observed around Christmas time.&lt;ref name="scalzi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessitaly.com/post/italian-coffee-break-part-1-e28094-paying-it-forward-in-naples.aspx|title=Italian Coffee Break part 1 — Paying it Forward in Naples|last=Scalzi|first=Mario|date=7 April 2010|work=Access Italy|accessdate=2013-03-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331040125/http://www.accessitaly.com/post/italian-coffee-break-part-1-e28094-paying-it-forward-in-naples.aspx|archivedate=31 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 article reported the tradition was obsolescent, the reporter having visited three bars where it had not been observed for at least 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://corrieredelmezzogiorno.corriere.it/campania/a_tavola/articoli/2008/10_Ottobre/06/caff%C3%A8_sospeso.shtml|title=Caffè sospeso, tradizione "sospesa" a un filo Rischia di scomparire la tazzulella benefica|last=W.|first=R.|work=Corriere del Mezzogiorno Campania|publisher=[[Corriere della Sera]]|language=Italian|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aurelio De Laurentiis]] is reported to pay for ten ''sospesi'' after each victory by [[S.S.C.

The ''sospeso'' gave the title to a 2008 journalism collection by Neapolitan [[Luciano De Crescenzo]], ''Il caffe sospeso: Saggezza quotidiana in piccoli sorsi'', which helped publicise the tradition throughout Italy.&lt;ref name="sofiaecho"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sofiaecho.com/2012/02/21/1770809_free-coffee-anyone|title=Free coffee, anyone?|last=Zhuk|first=Alyona|date=21 February 2012|work=The Sofia Echo|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crescenzo2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=Il caffè sospeso|last=Crescenzo|first=Luciano De|date=2010-10-07|publisher=Edizioni Mondadori|isbn=9788852014161|language=Italian}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2013-03-28--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The idea has been reported in cafés in [[Bulgaria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/World/News/Bulgarian-cafes-get-an-Italian-twist-20130325|title=Bulgarian cafés get an Italian twist|author=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date=25 March 2013|publisher=News24|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ukraine]],&lt;ref name="sofiaecho"/&gt; [[Australia]],&lt;ref name="theage"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/epicure/espresso/2009/04/20/1240079594155.html|title=Espresso: Coffee goodness|last=Dubecki|first=Larissa|date=21 April 2009|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/le-soleil/vivre-ici/societe/201304/11/01-4640087-un-premier-cafe-en-attente-a-quebec.php |title=Un premier "café en attente" à Québec &amp;#124; Claudette Samson &amp;#124; Société |publisher=Lapresse.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.getlokal.ro/en/page/suspended-coffee-romania|date= |title=Suspended coffee in Romania|work=getlokal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2012/01/07/63427265/|title=Coffee free of charge|last=Faustova|first=Milena|date=7 January 2012|work=Voice of Russia|accessdate=2013-03-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523041404/http://english.ruvr.ru/2012/01/07/63427265/#|archive-date=2013-05-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cafespendientes.es/ |title=Cafés Pendientes &amp;#124; ¿Te sumas a la iniciativa del Café Pendiente? #CafesPendientes |publisher=Cafespendientes.es |date=2013-11-07 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Argentina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncafependiente.com.ar/ |title=Cafe Pendiente |publisher=Uncafependiente.com.ar |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/steve_duin/index.ssf/2013/05/steve_duin_portland_joins_susp.html |title=Portland joins suspended coffee movement |publisher=OregonLive.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Costa Rica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacion.com/nacional/ticos-aprenden-regalar-Cafe-Pendiente_0_1350864923.html |title=Los ticos aprenden el arte de regalar café sin mirar a quién con el Café Pendiente |publisher=Nacion.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea received a revival in Italy in 2011 with several small Italian festivals forming a Suspended Coffee Network to encourage solidarity in response to cultural budget cuts,&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt; and a Dutch campaign at Christmas 2011 gave a discount on the price of the donated coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.at5.nl/artikelen/73480/caffe-sospeso-voor-inloophuizen|title=Caffè Sospeso voor inloophuizen -|date=21 December 2011|work=AT5 Echt Amsterdams Nieuws|language=Dutch|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, Neapolitan authorities declared an annual "Suspended Coffee Day".&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt;

In March 2013, John Sweeney launched a Facebook page for "Suspended Coffees", which by 2015 had led to the purchase of over 15 million coffees in 34 countries.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Razavi|first1=Lauren|title=Movement To Pay It Forward With A Cup Of Coffee Spills Into U.S.|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/12/17/460001377/movement-to-pay-it-forward-with-a-cup-of-coffee-spills-into-u-s|accessdate=13 April 2017|work=NPR.org|date=17 December 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK arm of coffee chain [[Starbucks]] signed up for a charity initiative based on the suspended coffee concept in April 2013, in which it said it would match the value of each suspended coffee with a cash donation to the [[Oasis Trust|Oasis charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reynolds |first=John |url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/1177756/Starbucks-joins-Suspended-Coffee-homeless-initiative |title=Starbucks joins Suspended Coffee homeless initiative |publisher=Marketing Magazine |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of the trend in other coffee shops in the UK also received media coverage around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22267613 |title=BBC News - Would you buy a 'suspended coffee' for someone in need? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-04-24 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July 2013, a Tuesday, an anonymous customer in [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]], [[Canada]], [[North America]] paid for 500 large coffees at Canadian coffee chain [[Tim Hortons]]. This started a trend that spread to a total of 30 locations with over 10,000 cups of coffee being paid for by donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davidson |first=Janet |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/are-we-hard-wired-to-buy-timmies-for-hundreds-of-strangers-1.1403205 |title=Are we hard-wired to buy Timmies for hundreds of strangers? |publisher=CBC |date=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==

The ''caffè sospeso'' has been identified as a symbol of grassroots social solidarity, prompting its revival in response to the [[Great Recession|2008 recession]] and [[European sovereign-debt crisis|ensuing eurozone crisis]].&lt;ref name="scalzi" /&gt; In 2004, a ''giornata nazionale del sospeso'' at Easter was announced by the ''Ronde della carità'' charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nove.firenze.it/vediarticolo.asp?id=a4.04.12.08.29|title=Oggi giornata nazionale del caffé "sospeso"|date=12 April 2004|work=Nove da Firenze|language=Italian|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a ''Giornata del Caffè Sospeso'' was scheduled to coincide with [[Human Rights Day]] in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaitaliano.info/news/10505/la-voce-del-corpo-di-luca-vullo-in-tour.html|title=La Voce del Corpo di Luca Vullo in tour|date=29 November 2011|work=CinemaItaliano.info|language=Italian|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of Italian arts festivals emphasising social solidarity in 2010 came together under the umbrella "Rete del Caffè Sospeso".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retedelcaffesospeso.com/principi/|title=Principi|publisher=Rete del Caffè Sospeso|language=Italian|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Italian fundraising website started by Luca Argentero is called 1caffe.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1caffe.org/|title=1 Caffè|language=Italian|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.greenews.info/rubriche/una-iena-piu-verde-che-nera-intervista-a-luca-argentero-20111223/|title=Una Iena più verde che nera.

The '''civil rights movement''' (also known as the '''African-American civil rights movement''', '''American civil rights movement''' and other terms){{efn|The social movement has also been called the '''Second Reconstruction''', '''modern civil rights movement''', '''civil rights revolution''', '''black revolution''', '''Negro movement''', '''black civil rights movement''', '''U.S. civil rights movement''', '''1960s civil rights movement''', '''Negro revolution''', '''Negro American revolution''', '''Negro revolt''', '''Southern freedom movement''', '''black rights movement''', '''United States civil rights movement''', '''American freedom movement''', and '''Negro freedom movement'''. The term '''civil rights struggle''' can denote this or other social movements that occurred during the same period in the United States. The span of time of the social movement is called the '''civil rights era'''.}} in the United States was a decades-long movement with the goal of enforcing constitutional and legal rights for [[African Americans]] that other Americans already enjoyed. With roots starting in the [[Reconstruction era]] during the late 19th century, the movement achieved its largest legislative gains in the mid-1960s, after years of direct actions and grassroots protests organized from the mid-1950s until 1968. Encompassing strategies, various groups, and organized [[social movement]]s to accomplish the goals of ending legalized [[Jim Crow laws|racial segregation]], [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]], and [[discrimination in the United States]], the movement, using major [[nonviolent]] campaigns, eventually secured new recognition in federal law and federal protection of all Americans.

After the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] in the 1860s, the [[Reconstruction Amendments]] to the [[United States Constitution]] granted emancipation and constitutional rights of citizenship to all African Americans, most of whom had recently been enslaved. For a period, African Americans voted and held political office, but they were increasingly deprived of [[civil rights]], often under [[Jim Crow laws]], and subjected to discrimination and sustained violence by whites in the South. Over the following century, various efforts were made by African Americans to secure their legal rights. Between 1955 and 1968, acts of [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] protest and [[civil disobedience]] produced crisis situations and productive dialogues between activists and government authorities. Federal, state, and local governments, businesses, and communities often had to respond immediately to these situations, which highlighted the [[Racism in the United States#African Americans|inequities faced by African Americans]] across the country. The [[lynching]] of Chicago teenager [[Emmett Till]] in Mississippi, and the outrage generated by seeing how he had been abused, when his mother decided to have an open-casket funeral, mobilized the African-American community nationwide.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/how-the-blood-of-emmett-till-still-stains-america-today/516891/ |title=How 'The Blood of Emmett Till' Still Stains America Today |last=II |first=Vann R.

Moderates in the movement worked with [[Congress (United States)|Congress]] to achieve the passage of several significant pieces of federal legislation that overturned discriminatory practices and authorized oversight and enforcement by the federal government. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]&lt;ref name="cra64"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |title=Civil Rights Act of 1964&amp;nbsp;– CRA&amp;nbsp;– Title VII&amp;nbsp;– Equal Employment Opportunities&amp;nbsp;– 42 US Code Chapter 21&amp;nbsp;– findUSlaw |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; expressly banned discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment practices; ended unequal application of voter registration requirements; and prohibited racial segregation in schools, at the workplace, and in [[public accommodations]]. The [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] restored and protected voting rights for minorities by authorizing federal oversight of registration and elections in areas with historic under-representation of minorities as voters. The [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]] banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. African Americans re-entered politics in the South, and across the country young people were inspired to take action.

From 1964 through 1970, a wave of [[Urban riots|inner-city riots]] in black communities undercut support from the white middle class, but increased support from [[private foundations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ICqREHoO6hoC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=radical+flank.+foundations#v=onepage&amp;q=radical%20flank.%20foundations&amp;f=false |title=Black Radicals and the Civil Rights Mainstream, 1954–1970 |last=Haines |first=Herbert H. |date=1995 |publisher=Univ. of Tennessee Press |isbn=978-1-57233-260-7 |location= |pages=98–118 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of the [[Black Power movement]], which lasted from about 1965 to 1975, challenged the established black leadership for its cooperative attitude and its practice of nonviolence. Instead, its leaders demanded that, in addition to the new laws gained through the nonviolent movement, political and economic self-sufficiency had to be developed in the black community.

Many popular representations of the movement are centered on the charismatic leadership and philosophy of the Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], who won the [[Nobel Peace Prize|1964 Nobel Peace Prize]] for his role in non-violent, moral leadership. However, some scholars note that the movement was too diverse to be credited to any one person, organization, or strategy.&lt;ref name="history.msu.edu"&gt;[http://history.msu.edu/files/2010/04/Timothy-Tyson.pdf Timothy B.

{{Further|Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Jim Crow laws}}

Before the [[American Civil War]], almost four million blacks were enslaved in the South, only white men of property could vote, and the [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] limited U.S. citizenship to whites only.

From 1865 to 1877, the United States underwent a turbulent [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction Era]] trying to establish free labor and [[civil rights]] of freedmen in the South after the end of slavery. Many whites resisted the social changes, leading to insurgent movements such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]], whose members attacked black and white [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] to maintain [[white supremacy]].

After the [[United States presidential election, 1876|disputed election]] of 1876 resulted in the end of Reconstruction and federal troops were withdrawn, whites in the South regained political control of the region's state legislatures. They continued to intimidate and violently attack blacks before and during elections to suppress their voting, but the last African Americans were elected to Congress from the South before disenfranchisement of blacks by states throughout the region, as described below.

[[File:Lynching-of-will-james.jpg|thumb|left|The mob-style [[lynching in the United States|lynching]] of Will James, [[Cairo, Illinois]], 1909]]

From 1890 to 1908, southern states passed new constitutions and laws to [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchise]] African Americans and many [[Poor White|poor whites]] by creating barriers to voter registration; voting rolls were dramatically reduced as blacks and poor whites were forced out of electoral politics. After the landmark Supreme Court case of ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'' (1944), which prohibited [[white primaries]], progress was made in increasing black political participation in the Rim South and [[Acadiana]] – although almost entirely in urban areas&lt;ref&gt;Klarman, Michael J.; 'The White Primary Rulings: A Case Study in the Consequences of Supreme Court Decisionmaking'; ''Florida State University Law Review'', vol. 29, issue 55, pp. 55-107&lt;/ref&gt; and a few rural localities where most blacks worked outside plantations.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Hanes (junior); Puckett, Sherman and Deskins Donald R. (junior); ''The African American Electorate: A Statistical History'', p. 539 {{ISBN|0872895084}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''status quo ante'' of excluding African Americans from the political system lasted in the remainder of the South, especially [[North Louisiana]], Mississippi and Alabama, until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s to provide federal enforcement of constitutional voting rights. For more than sixty years, blacks in the South were essentially excluded from politics, unable to elect anyone to represent their interests in Congress or local government.&lt;ref name="States afraid to take action" /&gt; Since they could not vote, they could not serve on local juries.

During this period, the white-dominated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] maintained political control of the South. With whites controlling all the seats representing the total population of the South, they had a powerful voting bloc in Congress. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]{{mdash}}the "party of Lincoln" and the party to which most blacks had belonged{{mdash}}shrank to insignificance except in remote [[Southern Unionist|Unionist]] areas of [[Appalachia]] and the [[Ozarks]] as black voter registration was suppressed.

During the same time as African Americans were being disenfranchised, white southerners imposed [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] by law. Violence against blacks increased, with numerous [[lynchings]] through the turn of the century. The system of ''[[de jure]]'' state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged from the post-Reconstruction South became known as the "[[Jim Crow]]" system. The [[United States Supreme Court]], made up almost entirely of Northerners, upheld the constitutionality of those state laws that required [[racial segregation]] in public facilities in its 1896 decision ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', legitimizing them through the "[[separate but equal]]" doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rayford Logan]],''The Betrayal of the Negro from Rutherford B. Hayes to Woodrow Wilson'', pp. 97–98. New York: Da Capo Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation, which began with slavery, continued with Jim Crow laws, with signs used to show blacks where they could legally walk, talk, drink, rest, or eat.&lt;ref name="Leon Litwack 2004"&gt;Leon Litwack, ''Jim Crow Blues'', Magazine of History (OAH Publications, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; For those places that were racially mixed, non-whites had to wait until all white customers were served first.&lt;ref name="Leon Litwack 2004" /&gt; Elected in 1912, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] gave in to demands by Southern members of his cabinet and ordered segregation of workplaces throughout the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kazin, Rebecca Edwards, Adam Rothman (2009). ''The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History''. p. 245. Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 20th century is a period often referred to as the "[[nadir of American race relations]]", when the number of lynchings was highest. While tensions and [[civil rights]] violations were most intense in the South, social discrimination affected African Americans in other regions as well.&lt;ref&gt;C. Vann Woodward, ''The Strange Career of Jim Crow'', 3rd rev. ed. (Oxford University Press, 1974), pp. 67–109.&lt;/ref&gt; At the national level, the Southern bloc controlled important committees in Congress, defeated passage of federal laws against lynching, and exercised considerable power beyond the number of whites in the South.

Characteristics of the post-Reconstruction period:
* [[Racial segregation]]. By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate "white" and "colored" domains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/info/seglaws.htm Birmingham Segregation Laws] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204031120/http://www.crmvet.org/info/seglaws.htm |date=February 4, 2011 }}&amp;nbsp;– Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristically, those for colored were underfunded and of inferior quality.
* [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|Disenfranchisement]]. When white Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more restrictive, essentially forcing black voters off the voting rolls. The number of African-American voters dropped dramatically, and they were no longer able to elect representatives. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised tens of thousands of African Americans, and U.S. states such as Alabama disenfranchised poor whites as well.
* [[Exploitation of labour|Exploitation]]. Increased economic oppression of blacks through the [[convict lease]] system, [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]], and [[Asian Pacific American|Asians]], denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.
* Violence. Individual, police, paramilitary, organizational, and [[Mass racial violence in the United States|mob racial violence against blacks]] (and Latinos in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] and Asians in [[California]]).

[[File:KKK night rally in Chicago c1920 cph.3b12355.jpg|thumb|KKK night rally in [[Chicago]], {{circa|1920}}]]

African Americans and other ethnic minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it in numerous ways and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing (see the [[African-American civil rights movement (1896–1954)]]). The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) was founded in 1909. It fought to end race discrimination through [[litigation]], education, and [[lobbying]] efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) when the Court rejected separate white and colored school systems and, by implication, overturned the "[[separate but equal]]" doctrine established in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' of 1896. Segregation had continued intact into the mid-1950s. Following the unanimous Supreme Court decision in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) that ruled that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional, many states began to gradually integrate their schools, but some areas of the South resisted by closing public schools altogether.

The integration of Southern public libraries followed demonstrations and protests that used techniques seen in other elements of the larger civil rights movement.&lt;ref name="Fultz, M. 2006"&gt;Fultz, M. (2006). "Black Public Libraries in the South in the Era of De Jure Segregation", ''Libraries &amp; The Cultural Record'', 41(3), 338–346.&lt;/ref&gt; This included sit-ins, beatings, and white resistance.&lt;ref name="Fultz, M. 2006" /&gt; For example, in 1963 in the city of [[Anniston, Alabama]], two black ministers were brutally beaten for attempting to integrate the public library.&lt;ref name="Fultz, M. 2006" /&gt; Though there was resistance and violence, the integration of libraries was generally quicker than the integration of other public institutions.&lt;ref name="Fultz, M. 2006" /&gt;

[[File:ColoredSailersRoomWWINOLA.jpg|thumb|left|Colored Sailors room in World War I]]

The situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs). From 1910 to 1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west out of the South. A total of nearly seven million blacks left the South in what was known as the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], most during and after World War II. So many people migrated that the demographics of some previously black-majority states changed to white majority (in combination with other developments). The rapid influx of blacks altered the demographics of Northern cities; happening at a period of expanded immigration from Europe, it added to social competition and tensions, with the new migrants and immigrants battling for place in jobs and housing.

Reflecting social tensions after World War I, as veterans struggled to return to the workforce and labor unioins were organizing, the [[Red Summer]] of 1919 was marked by hundreds of deaths and higher casualties across the U.S. as a result of white race riots against blacks that took place in more than three dozen cities, such as the [[Chicago race riot of 1919]] and the [[Omaha race riot of 1919]]. Stereotypic schemas of Southern blacks were used to attribute issues in urban areas, such as crime and disease, to the presence of African-Americans. Overall, African Americans in Northern cities experienced [[Racism in the United States|systemic discrimination]] in a plethora of aspects of life. Within employment, economic opportunities for blacks were routed to the lowest-status and restrictive in potential mobility. Within the housing market, stronger discriminatory measures were used in correlation to the influx, resulting in a mix of "targeted violence, [[restrictive covenants]], [[redlining]] and racial steering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tolnay |first=Stewart |title=The African American 'Great Migration' and Beyond |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |year=2003 |volume=29 |pages=218–221 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100009 |jstor=30036966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Migration resulted in many African Americans becoming urbanized, and they began to realign from the Republican to the Democratic Party, especially because of opportunities under the [[New Deal]] of the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] administration during the Great Depression in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/BAIC/Historical-Essays/Keeping-the-Faith/Party-Realignment--New-Deal/ |title=Party Realignment And The New Deal |agency=US House of Representatives: History, Art &amp; Archives |access-date=May 31, 2018  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530121202/http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/BAIC/Historical-Essays/Keeping-the-Faith/Party-Realignment--New-Deal/ |archive-date=May 30, 2018 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Substantially under pressure from African-American supporters who began the [[March on Washington Movement]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] issued the first federal order banning discrimination and created the [[Fair Employment Practice Committee]]. Black veterans of the military after both World Wars pressed for full civil rights and often led activist movements. In 1948, they gained integration in the military under President [[Harry Truman]], who issued [[Executive Order 9981]] to accomplish it.

[[File:We want white tenants.jpg|thumb|White tenants seeking to prevent blacks from moving into the [[Public housing in Detroit|housing project]] erected this sign, [[Detroit]], 1942.]]

[[Housing segregation]] was a nationwide problem, widespread outside the South. Although the federal government had become increasingly involved in mortgage lending and development in the 1930s and 1940s, it did not reject the use of race-restrictive covenants until 1950, in part because of provisions by the Solid South Democrats in Congress.&lt;ref name="propublica.org" /&gt; Suburbanization became connected with [[white flight]] by this time, because whites were better established economically to move to newer housing. The situation was perpetuated by real estate agents' continuing [[Residential segregation|racial discrimination]]. In particular, from the 1930s to the 1960s, the National Association of Real Estate Boards (NAREB) issued guidelines that specified that a realtor "should never be instrumental in introducing to a neighborhood a character or property or occupancy, members of any race or nationality, or any individual whose presence will be clearly detrimental to property values in a neighborhood." The result was the development of all-black [[ghettos]] in the North, where much housing was older, as well as South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilrights.org/publications/reports/fairhousing/historical.html |title=Future of Fair Housing: How We Got Here |accessdate=July 29, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160707035121/http://www.civilrights.org/publications/reports/fairhousing/historical.html |archivedate=July 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Invigorated by the victory of ''Brown'' and frustrated by the lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about [[desegregation]]. They were faced with "[[massive resistance]]" in the South by proponents of racial segregation and [[disfranchisement|voter suppression]]. In defiance, African-American activists adopted a combined strategy of [[direct action]], [[nonviolence]], [[nonviolent resistance]], and many events described as [[civil disobedience]], giving rise to the civil rights movement of 1954 to 1968.

== The beginnings of direct action (1950s) ==
The strategy of public education, legislative lobbying, and litigation that had typified the civil rights movement during the first half of the 20th century broadened after ''Brown'' to a strategy that emphasized "[[direct action]]": boycotts, [[sit-in]]s, [[Freedom Rides]], marches or walks, and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance, standing in line, and, at times, civil disobedience.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Churches, local grassroots organizations, fraternal societies, and black-owned businesses mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges used by the NAACP and others.

In 1952, the [[Regional Council of Negro Leadership]] (RCNL), led by [[T. R. M. Howard]], a black surgeon, entrepreneur, and planter, organized a successful boycott of gas stations in Mississippi that refused to provide restrooms for blacks. Through the RCNL, Howard led campaigns to expose brutality by the Mississippi state highway patrol and to encourage blacks to make deposits in the black-owned [[Tri-State Bank]] of [[Nashville]] which, in turn, gave loans to civil rights activists who were victims of a "credit squeeze" by the [[White Citizens' Councils]].&lt;ref name="Beito and Beito"&gt;David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, ''Black Maverick: T.R.M. Howard's Fight for Civil Rights and Economic Power'', Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2009, pp. 81, 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Claudette Colvin]] was arrested for not giving up her seat on a [[Montgomery, Alabama]] bus in March 1955, a bus boycott was considered and rejected. But when [[Rosa Parks]] was arrested in December, [[Jo Ann Robinson|Jo Ann Gibson Robinson]] of the Montgomery Women's Political Council put the bus boycott protest in motion. Late that night, she, John Cannon (chairman of the Business Department at [[Alabama State University]]) and others mimeographed and distributed thousands of leaflets calling for a boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Robinson, Jo Ann Gibson (1912–1992) |url=http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_robinson_jo_ann_1912_1992/ |website=The Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203033954/http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_robinson_jo_ann_1912_1992/ |archive-date=February 3, 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson 1986"&gt;Robinson, Jo Ann &amp; Garrow, David J.

It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the successful [[Tallahassee, Florida]] boycott of 1956–57.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tallahassee.com/special/boycott/reader-smith.html "The Tallahassee Bus Boycott—Fifty Years Later]," ''The Tallahassee Democrat'', May 21, 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210094329/http://www.tallahassee.com/special/boycott/reader-smith.html |date=December 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Dr. King and Rev. [[Ralph Abernathy]], the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. [[C. K. Steele]] of Tallahassee and Rev. [[T. J. Jemison]] of Baton Rouge, and other activists such as Rev. [[Fred Shuttlesworth]], [[Ella Baker]], [[A. Philip Randolph]], [[Bayard Rustin]] and [[Stanley Levison]], to form the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC). The SCLC, with its headquarters in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from Northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made nonviolence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.

In 1959, [[Septima Clarke]], Bernice Robinson, and [[Esau Jenkins]], with the help of [[Myles Horton]]'s [[Highlander Research and Education Center|Highlander Folk School]] in [[Tennessee]], began the first Citizenship Schools in [[South Carolina]]'s [[Sea Islands]]. They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on [[Johns Island, South Carolina|Johns Island]]. SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.

{{Main|Brown v. Board of Education}}

In the spring of 1951, black students in [[Virginia]] protested their unequal status in the state's segregated educational system. Students at [[R.R. Moton High School|Moton High School]] protested the overcrowded conditions and failing facility.&lt;ref name="autogenerated55"&gt;Klarman, Michael J.,''Brown v. Board of Education and the Civil Rights Movement'' [electronic resource] : abridged edition of ''From Jim Crow to Civil Rights: The Supreme Court and the Struggle for Racial Equality'', Oxford ; New York : Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Some local leaders of the NAACP had tried to persuade the students to back down from their protest against the Jim Crow laws of school segregation. When the students did not budge, the NAACP joined their battle against school segregation. The NAACP proceeded with five cases challenging the school systems; these were later combined under what is known today as ''Brown v. Board of Education''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated55" /&gt;

On May 17, 1954, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled unanimously in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]] of Topeka, Kansas'', that mandating, or even permitting, [[School segregation in the United States|public schools to be segregated]] by race was [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. The Court stated that the

The lawyers from the NAACP had to gather plausible evidence in order to win the case of ''Brown vs. Board of Education''. Their method of addressing the issue of school segregation was to enumerate several arguments. One pertained to having exposure to interracial contact in a school environment. It was argued that interracial contact would, in turn, help prepare children to live with the pressures that society exerts in regards to race and thereby afford them a better chance of living in a democracy. In addition, another argument emphasized how "'education' comprehends the entire process of developing and training the mental, physical and moral powers and capabilities of human beings".&lt;ref&gt;Risa L. Goluboff, ''The Lost Promise of Civil Rights'', Harvard University Press, MA: Cambridge, 2007, pp. 249–251&lt;/ref&gt;

Risa Goluboff wrote that the NAACP's intention was to show the Courts that African American children were the victims of school segregation and their futures were at risk. The Court ruled that both ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896), which had established the "separate but equal" standard in general, and ''[[Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education]]'' (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional.

The federal government filed a [[friend of the court brief]] in the case urging the justices to consider the effect that segregation had on America's image in the [[Cold War]]. Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] was quoted in the brief stating that ''"The United States is under constant attack in the foreign press, over the foreign radio, and in such international bodies as the United Nations because of various practices of discrimination in this country."''

On May 18, 1954, [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], became the first city in the South to publicly announce that it would abide by the Supreme Court's ''Brown v. Board of Education'' ruling. "It is unthinkable,' remarked School Board Superintendent Benjamin Smith, 'that we will try to [override] the laws of the United States."&lt;ref name="deseg" /&gt; This positive reception for Brown, together with the appointment of African American Dr. David Jones to the school board in 1953, convinced numerous white and black citizens that Greensboro was heading in a progressive direction. Integration in Greensboro occurred rather peacefully compared to the process in Southern states such as Alabama, [[Arkansas]], and Virginia where "[[massive resistance]]" was practiced by top officials and throughout the states. In Virginia, some counties closed their public schools rather than integrate, and many white [[Christian]] private schools were founded to accommodate students who used to go to public schools. Even in Greensboro, much local resistance to desegregation continued, and in 1969, the federal government found the city was not in compliance with the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Transition to a fully integrated school system did not begin until 1971.&lt;ref name="deseg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.uncg.edu/dp/crg/topicalessays/schooldeseginteg.aspx |title=Civil Rights Greensboro |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Northern cities also had [[Racial segregation#United States of America|de facto segregation]] policies, which resulted in a vast gulf in educational resources between black and white communities. In [[Harlem (Manhattan)|Harlem]], New York, for example, neither a single new school was built since the turn of the century, nor did a single nursery school exist&amp;nbsp;– even as the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]] was causing overcrowding. Existing schools tended to be dilapidated and staffed with inexperienced teachers. ''Brown'' helped stimulate activism among [[New York City]] parents like [[Mae Mallory]] who, with the support of the NAACP, initiated a successful lawsuit against the city and state on ''Brown'''s principles. Mallory and thousands of other parents bolstered the pressure of the lawsuit with a school boycott in 1959. During the boycott, some of the first [[freedom schools]] of the period were established. The city responded to the campaign by permitting more open transfers to high-quality, historically-white schools. (New York's African-American community, and Northern desegregation activists generally, now found themselves contending with the problem of [[white flight]], however.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AkPnRoKK-XYC&amp;pg=PA54 |title=Power, Protest, and the Public Schools: Jewish and African American Struggles in New York City |first=Melissa F. |last=Weiner |date=2010 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-4772-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hisofblackamfall2014.voices.wooster.edu/files/2014/08/Adina_Back_Exposing_the_Whole_Segregation_Myth3.pdf Adina Back "Exposing the Whole Segregation Myth: The Harlem Nine and New York City Schools" in ''Freedom north: Black freedom struggles outside the South, 1940–1980'', Jeanne Theoharis, Komozi Woodard, eds.(Palgrave Macmillan, 2003) pp. 65–91]&lt;/ref&gt;

Emmett Till, a 14-year old African American from Chicago, visited his relatives in Money, Mississippi, for the summer. He allegedly had an interaction with a white woman, Carolyn Bryant, in a small grocery store that violated the norms of Mississippi culture, and Bryant's husband Roy and his half-brother J. W. Milam brutally murdered young Emmett Till. They beat and mutilated him before shooting him in the head and sinking his body in the&amp;nbsp;[[Tallahatchie River]]. Three days later, Till's body was discovered and retrieved from the river. [[Mamie Till]], Emmett's Mother, "brought him home to Chicago and insisted on an open casket. Tens of thousands filed past Till's remains, but it was the publication of the searing funeral image in&amp;nbsp;''Jet'', with a stoic Mamie gazing at her murdered child's ravaged body, that forced the world to reckon with the brutality of American racism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://100photos.time.com/photos/emmett-till-david-jackson |title=How The Horrific Photograph Of Emmett Till Helped Energize The Civil Rights Movement |website=100 Photographs {{!}} The Most Influential Images of All Time|access-date=July 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706123149/http://100photos.time.com/photos/emmett-till-david-jackson|archive-date=July 6, 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vann R.

=== Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955–1956 ===
{{Main|Rosa Parks|Montgomery Bus Boycott}}

[[File:Rosa Parks being fingerprinted by Deputy Sheriff D.H. Lackey after being arrested for boycotting public transportation - Original.jpg|thumb|[[Rosa Parks]] being fingerprinted by Deputy Sheriff D.H. Lackey after being arrested for not giving up her seat on a bus to a white person]]

On December 1, 1955, nine months after a 15-year-old high school student, [[Claudette Colvin]], refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a public bus in Montgomery, Alabama, and was arrested, [[Rosa Parks]] did the same thing. Parks soon became the symbol of the resulting Montgomery Bus Boycott and received national publicity. She was later hailed as the "mother of the civil rights movement".

Parks was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the [[Highlander Research and Education Center|Highlander Folk School]] in Tennessee where nonviolence as a strategy was taught by [[Myles Horton]] and others. After Parks' arrest, African Americans gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to demand a bus system in which passengers would be treated equally.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chafe |first1=William Henry |title=The Unfinished Journey: America since World War II |date=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-515049-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C0ShgrzbLMcC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was led by Jo Ann Robinson, a member of the Women's Political Council who had been waiting for the opportunity to boycott the bus system. Following Rosa Park's arrest, Jo Ann Robinson mimeographed 52,500 leaflets calling for a boycott. They were distributed around the city and helped gather the attention of civil rights leaders. After the city rejected many of their suggested reforms, the NAACP, led by [[Edgar Nixon|E. D. Nixon]], pushed for full desegregation of public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days, until the local ordinance segregating African Americans and whites on public buses was repealed. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery partook in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue significantly, as they comprised the majority of the riders. In November 1956, the United State Supreme Court upheld a district court ruling in the case of ''[[Browder v. Gayle]]'' and ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated, ending the boycott.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Local leaders established the Montgomery Improvement Association to focus their efforts. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] was elected President of this organization. The lengthy protest attracted national attention for him and the city. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.&lt;ref name="Robinson 1986" /&gt;

=== Desegregating Little Rock Central High School, 1957 ===
{{Main|Little Rock Nine}}
[[File:101st Airborne at Little Rock Central High.jpg|thumb|Troops from the [[327th Infantry Regiment|327th Regiment, 101st Airborne]] escorting the [[Little Rock Nine]] African-American students up the steps of Central High]]

A crisis erupted in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], when [[Governor of Arkansas]] [[Orval Faubus]] called out the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] on September 4 to prevent entry to the [[Little Rock Nine|nine African-American students]] who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school, [[Little Rock Central High School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis57.htm#1957lrsd The Little Rock Nine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504182855/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis57.htm#1957lrsd |date=May 4, 2017 }}&amp;nbsp;– Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt; Under the guidance of [[Daisy Bates (civil rights activist)|Daisy Bates]], the nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades.

On the first day of school, 15-year-old [[Elizabeth Eckford]] was the only one of the nine students who showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. A photo was taken of Eckford being harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car for her protection. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in [[jeep]]s.

[[File:Little Rock integration protest.jpg|thumb|left|White parents rally against integrating Little Rock's schools]]

Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the ''Brown'' decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court ruling. Faubus' resistance received the attention of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. But, Eisenhower federalized the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] in Arkansas and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower deployed elements of the [[101st Airborne Division]] to Little Rock to protect the students.

The students attended high school under harsh conditions. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from other students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers were not around. One of the Little Rock Nine, [[Minnijean Brown-Trickey|Minnijean Brown]], was suspended for spilling a bowl of chilli on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line. Later, she was expelled for verbally abusing a white female student.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.america.gov/st/diversity-english/2007/August/20070824131706berehellek0.2049982.html Minnijean Brown Trickey, America.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128093710/http://www.america.gov/st/diversity-english/2007/August/20070824131706berehellek0.2049982.html |date=November 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only [[Ernest Green]] of the Little Rock Nine graduated from Central High School. After the 1957–58 school year was over, Little Rock closed its public school system completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.

=== The method of Nonviolence and Nonviolence Training ===
During the time period considered to be the "African-American civil rights" era, the predominant use of protest was nonviolent, or peaceful.&lt;ref name=Erikson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erikson |first1=Erik |title=Gandhi's Truth: On the Origins of Militant Nonviolence |date=1969 |publisher=Norton |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-393-31034-4 |page=415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often referred to as pacifism, the method of nonviolence is considered to be an attempt to impact society positively. Although acts of racial discrimination have occurred historically throughout the United States, perhaps the most violent regions have been in the former Confederate states. During the 1950s and 1960s, the nonviolent protesting of the civil rights movement caused definite tension, which gained national attention.

In order to prepare for protests physically and psychologically, demonstrators received training in nonviolence. According to former civil rights activist Bruce Hartford, there are two main branches of nonviolence training. There is the philosophical method, which involves understanding the method of nonviolence and why it is considered useful, and there is the tactical method, which ultimately teaches demonstrators "how to be a protestor{{mdash}}how to sit-in, how to picket, how to defend yourself against attack, giving training on how to remain cool when people are screaming racist insults into your face and pouring stuff on you and hitting you" (Civil Rights Movement Veterans). The philosophical method of nonviolence, in the American civil rights movement, was largely inspired by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s "non-cooperation" with the British colonists in India, which was intended to gain attention so that the public would either "intervene in advance," or "provide public pressure in support of the action to be taken" (Erikson, 415). As Hartford explains it, philosophical nonviolence training aims to "shape the individual person's attitude and mental response to crises and violence" (Civil Rights Movement Veterans). Hartford and activists like him, who trained in tactical nonviolence, considered it necessary in order to ensure physical safety, instill discipline, teach demonstrators how to demonstrate, and form mutual confidence among demonstrators (Civil Rights Movement Veterans).&lt;ref name=Erikson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Civil Rights Movement Veterans |url=http://www.crmvet.org/info/nv3.htm |website=Civil Rights Movement Veterans |accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many, the concept of nonviolent protest was a way of life, a culture. However, not everyone agreed with this notion. James Forman, former SNCC (and later Black Panther) member and nonviolence trainer, was among those who did not. In his autobiography, ''The Making of Black Revolutionaries'', Forman revealed his perspective on the method of nonviolence as "strictly a tactic, not a way of life without limitations." Similarly, Robert Moses, who was also an active member of SNCC, felt that the method of nonviolence was practical. When interviewed by author Robert Penn Warren, Moses said "There's no question that he [Martin Luther King Jr.] had a great deal of influence with the masses. But I don't think it's in the direction of love. It's in a practical direction . . ." (Who Speaks for the Negro? Warren).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bruce Hartford (full interview) |url=https://vimeo.com/17532881 |via=Vimeo |accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Forman |first1=James |title=The Making of Black Revolutionaries |date=1972 |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=978-0-940880-10-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robert F. Williams and the debate on nonviolence, 1959–1964 ===
The Jim Crow system employed "terror as a means of social control,"&lt;ref&gt;Francis Fox Piven and Richard Cloward, ''Poor People's Movements: How They Succeed, How They Fail'' (Random House, 1977), 182&lt;/ref&gt; with the most organized manifestations being the Ku Klux Klan and their collaborators in local police departments. This violence played a key role in blocking the progress of the civil rights movement in the late 1950s. Some black organizations in the South began practicing armed self-defense. The first to do so openly was the Monroe, North Carolina, chapter of the NAACP led by [[Robert F. Williams]]. Williams had rebuilt the chapter after its membership was terrorized out of public life by the Klan. He did so by encouraging a new, more working-class membership to arm itself thoroughly and defend against attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uncpress.unc.edu/books/T-1534.html Timothy B. Tyson, ''Radio Free Dixie: Robert F. Williams and the Roots of "Black Power"'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1999), 79–80]&lt;/ref&gt; When Klan nightriders attacked the home of NAACP member Dr. Albert Perry in October 1957, Williams' militia exchanged gunfire with the stunned Klansmen, who quickly retreated. The following day, the city council held an emergency session and passed an ordinance banning KKK motorcades.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, Radio Free Dixie, 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, Lumbee Indians in North Carolina would have a similarly successful armed stand-off with the Klan (known as the [[Battle of Hayes Pond]]) which resulted in KKK leader James W. "Catfish" Cole being convicted of incitement to riot.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Graham, [http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-postwar/6068 "January 1958: The Lumbees face the Klan"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206071001/http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-postwar/6068 |date=February 6, 2018 }}, This Month in North Carolina History&lt;/ref&gt;

After the acquittal of several white men charged with sexually assaulting black women in Monroe, Williams announced to United Press International reporters that he would "meet violence with violence" as a policy. Williams' declaration was quoted on the front page of ''The New York Times'', and ''The Carolina Times'' considered it "the biggest civil rights story of 1959."&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, Radio Free Dixie, 149&lt;/ref&gt; NAACP National chairman Roy Wilkins immediately suspended Williams from his position, but the Monroe organizer won support from numerous NAACP chapters across the country. Ultimately, Wilkins resorted to bribing influential organizer Daisy Bates to campaign against Williams at the NAACP national convention and the suspension was upheld. The convention nonetheless passed a resolution which stated: "We do not deny, but reaffirm the right of individual and collective self-defense against unlawful assaults."&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, Radio Free Dixie, 159–164&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Luther King Jr. argued for Williams' removal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_williams_robert_franklin_1925_1996/ |title=Williams, Robert Franklin (1925–1996) |accessdate=July 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518130204/http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_williams_robert_franklin_1925_1996 |archive-date=May 18, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but Ella Baker&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SEfOhvXSvZsC&amp;pg=PA213 Barbara Ransby, ''Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement: A Radical Democratic Vision'' (University of North Carolina Press, 2003), 213–216]&lt;/ref&gt; and WEB Dubois&lt;ref name="history.msu.edu" /&gt; both publicly praised the Monroe leader's position.

Williams{{mdash}}along with his wife, Mabel Williams{{mdash}}continued to play a leadership role in the Monroe movement, and to some degree, in the national movement. The Williamses published ''The Crusader'', a nationally circulated newsletter, beginning in 1960, and the influential book [http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/maai3/protest/text6/williamsnegroeswithguns.pdf ''Negroes With Guns''] in 1962. Williams did not call for full militarization in this period, but "flexibility in the freedom struggle."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.lexisnexis.com/documents/academic/upa_cis/9353_BlackPowerMovemPt2.pdf The Black Power Movement, Part 2: The Papers of Robert F.

Williams led the Monroe movement in another armed stand-off with white supremacists during an August 1961 Freedom Ride; he had been invited to participate in the campaign by [[Ella Baker]] and [[James Forman]] of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). The incident (along with his campaigns for peace with Cuba) resulted in him being targeted by the FBI and prosecuted for kidnapping; he was cleared of all charges in 1976.&lt;ref name="Tyson 1998"&gt;Tyson, ''Journal of American History'' (September 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, armed self-defense continued discreetly in the Southern movement with such figures as SNCC's [[Amzie Moore]],&lt;ref name="Tyson 1998" /&gt; [[Hartman Turnbow]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Taylor Branch]], ''[[Parting the Waters: America in the King Years 1954–1963]]'' (Simon and Schuster, 1988), 781&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fannie Lou Hamer]]&lt;ref&gt;Simon Wendt, The Spirit and the Shotgun: Armed Resistance and the Struggle for Civil Rights (University of Florida Press, 2007), 121–122; Mike Marqusee, "By Any Means Necessary" ''The Nation'', September 24, 2004&amp;nbsp;– http://www.thenation.com/article/any-means-necessary# {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224101340/http://www.thenation.com/article/any-means-necessary |date=February 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; all willing to use arms to defend their lives from nightrides. Taking refuge from the FBI in Cuba, the Willamses broadcast the radio show "[[Radio Free Dixie]]" throughout the eastern United States via Radio Progresso beginning in 1962. In this period, Williams advocated guerilla warfare against racist institutions, and saw the large ghetto riots of the era as a manifestation of his strategy.

[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] historian Walter Rucker has written that "the emergence of Robert F Williams contributed to the marked decline in anti-black racial violence in the U.S....After centuries of anti-black violence, African Americans across the country began to defend their communities aggressively{{mdash}}employing overt force when necessary.  This in turn evoked in whites real fear of black vengeance..." This opened up space for African Americans to use nonviolent demonstration with less fear of deadly reprisal.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Rucker, "Crusader in Exile: Robert F. Williams and the International Struggle for Black Freedom in America" The Black Scholar 36, No. 2–3 (Summer–Fall 2006): 19–33.

Parks gave the eulogy at Williams' funeral in 1996, praising him for "his courage and for his commitment to freedom," and concluding that "The sacrifices he made, and what he did, should go down in history and never be forgotten."&lt;ref&gt;Timothy B.

Mostly black students from area colleges led a sit-in at a [[F. W.

The protesters had been encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in.

As students across the south began to "sit-in" at the lunch counters of local stores, police and other officials sometimes used brutal force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.

The "sit-in" technique was not new{{mdash}}as far back as 1939, African-American attorney [[Samuel Wilbert Tucker]] organized a sit-in at the then-segregated [[Alexandria, Virginia]], library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=America's First Sit-Down Strike: The 1939 Alexandria Library Sit-In |url=http://oha.alexandriava.gov/bhrc/lessons/bh-lesson2_reading2.html |publisher=City of Alexandria |accessdate=February 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528015924/http://oha.alexandriava.gov/bhrc/lessons/bh-lesson2_reading2.html |archivedate=May 28, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Davis |first=Townsend |title=Weary Feet, Rested Souls: A Guided History of the Civil Rights Movement |publisher=W.

Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public facilities. In April 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins were invited by SCLC activist [[Ella Baker]] to hold a conference at [[Shaw University]], a [[historically black university]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. This conference led to the formation of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC).&lt;ref name="carson"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Carson |first=Clayborne |title=In Struggle: SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1981 |location=Cambridge |page=311 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fm9v7KKj_UQC |doi= |id= |isbn=978-0-674-44727-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; SNCC took these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further, and organized the freedom rides. As the constitution protected interstate commerce, they decided to challenge segregation on interstate buses and in public bus facilities by putting interracial teams on them, to travel from the North through the segregated South.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis60.htm#1960sncc Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306200430/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis60.htm#1960sncc |date=March 6, 2007 }}&amp;nbsp;– Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom Rides, 1961 ===
{{Main|Freedom Rider}}

Freedom Rides were journeys by civil rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision ''[[Boynton v. Virginia]]'', 364 U.S. 454 (1960), which ruled that segregation was unconstitutional for passengers engaged in interstate travel. Organized by [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]], the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17.&lt;ref name="Freedom Rides"&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis61.htm#1961frides Freedom Rides] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707051408/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis61.htm#1961frides |date=July 7, 2010 }}&amp;nbsp;– Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists travelled through the [[Deep South]] to integrate seating patterns on buses and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In [[Anniston, Alabama]], one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives.&lt;ref name="Arsenault"&gt;{{cite book |last=Arsenault |first=Raymond |title=Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice |publisher=Oxford Press |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Freedom Riders attacked.jpg|thumb|A mob beats Freedom Riders in Birmingham. This picture was reclaimed by the FBI from a local journalist who also was beaten and whose camera was smashed.]]

In [[Birmingham, Alabama]], an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner [[Eugene "Bull" Connor]] gave Ku Klux Klan members fifteen minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police "protect" them. The riders were severely beaten "until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them." [[James Peck (pacifist)|James Peck]], a white activist, was beaten so badly that he required fifty stitches to his head.&lt;ref name="Arsenault" /&gt;

In a similar occurrence in Montgomery, Alabama, the Freedom Riders followed in the footsteps of Rosa Parks and rode an integrated Greyhound bus from Birmingham. Although they were protesting interstate bus segregation in peace, they were met with violence in Montgomery as a large, white mob attacked them for their activism. They caused an enormous, 2-hour long riot which resulted in 22 injuries, five of whom were hospitalized.&lt;ref&gt;Black Protest (1961)&lt;/ref&gt;

Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides. SNCC activists from Nashville brought in new riders to continue the journey from Birmingham to New Orleans. In [[Montgomery, Alabama]], at the [[Greyhound Bus Station (Montgomery, Alabama)|Greyhound Bus Station]], a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] unconscious with a crate and smashing ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' photographer [[Don Urbrock]] in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded [[James Zwerg]], a white student from [[Fisk University]], and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.&lt;ref name="Arsenault" /&gt;

On May 24, 1961, the freedom riders continued their rides into [[Jackson, Mississippi]], where they were arrested for "breaching the peace" by using "white only" facilities. New Freedom Rides were organized by many different organizations and continued to flow into the South. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.&lt;ref name="Freedom Rides" /&gt;

From lockup, the Riders announce "Jail No Bail"{{mdash}}they will not pay fines for unconstitutional arrests and illegal convictions{{mdash}}and by staying in jail they keep the issue alive. Each prisoner will remain in jail for 39 days, the maximum time they can serve without loosing{{sic}} their right to appeal the unconstitutionality of their arrests, trials, and convictions.

The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In Jackson, some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100&amp;nbsp;°F heat. Others were transferred to the [[Mississippi State Penitentiary]] at Parchman, where they were treated to harsh conditions. Sometimes the men were suspended by "wrist breakers" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.

Public sympathy and support for the freedom riders led [[John F. Kennedy]]'s administration to order the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, 1961, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; "white" and "colored" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.

The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, a single-minded activist; [[James Lawson (American activist)|James Lawson]], the revered "guru" of nonviolent theory and tactics; [[Diane Nash]], an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice; [[Robert Parris Moses|Bob Moses]], pioneer of voting registration in Mississippi; and [[James Bevel]], a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer, strategist, and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included [[Charles McDew]], [[Bernard Lafayette]], [[Charles Jones (activist)|Charles Jones]], [[Lonnie C. King Jr.|Lonnie King]], [[Julian Bond]], [[Hosea Williams]], and [[Stokely Carmichael]].

=== Voter registration organizing ===
After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as [[Amzie Moore]], [[Aaron Henry]], [[Medgar Evers]], and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and to build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its new constitution in 1890 with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from voter rolls and voting. In addition, violence at the time of elections had earlier suppressed black voting.

By the mid-20th century, preventing blacks from voting had become an essential part of the culture of white supremacy. In June and July of 1959, members of the black community in Fayette County, TN formed the Fayette County Civic and Welfare League to spur voting. At the time, there were 16,927 blacks in the county, yet only 17 of them had voted in the previous seven years. Within a year, some 1,400 blacks had registered, and the white community responded with harsh economic reprisals. Using registration rolls, the White Citizens Council circulated a blacklist of all registered black voters, allowing banks, local stores and gas stations to conspire to deny registered black voters basic services. What's more, sharecropping blacks who registered to vote were summarily evicted from their homes. All in all, the number of evictions came to 257 families, many of whom were forced to live in a makeshift Tent City for well over a year. Finally, in December 1960, the Justice Department invoked its powers authorized by the Civil Rights Act of 1957 to file a suit against seventy parties accused of violating the civil rights of black Fayette County citizens.&lt;ref&gt; Our Portion of Hell: Fayette County, Tennessee, an Oral History of the Struggle For Civil Rights by Robert Hamburger (New York; Links Books, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year the first voter registration project in [[McComb, Mississippi|McComb]] and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen, the [[White Citizens' Council]], and the Ku Klux Klan. Activists were beaten, there were hundreds of arrests of local citizens, and the voting activist Herbert Lee was murdered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis61.htm#1961mccomb Voter Registration &amp; Direct-action in McComb MS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707051408/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis61.htm#1961mccomb |date=July 7, 2010 }}&amp;nbsp;– Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;

White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the [[Council of Federated Organizations]] (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis62.htm#1962cofo Council of Federated Organizations Formed in Mississippi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004011259/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis62.htm#1962cofo |date=October 4, 2006 }}&amp;nbsp;– Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the [[Voter Education Project]], SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around [[Greenwood, Mississippi|Greenwood]], and the areas surrounding [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi|Hattiesburg]], [[Laurel, Mississippi|Laurel]], and [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]]. As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition{{mdash}}arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the [[literacy test]] to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that even highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register, and landlords evicted them from their rental homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis62.htm Mississippi Voter Registration—Greenwood] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004011259/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis62.htm |date=October 4, 2006 }}&amp;nbsp;– Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these actions, over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.

Similar voter registration campaigns{{mdash}}with similar responses{{mdash}}were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in [[Louisiana]], [[Alabama]], southwest [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[South Carolina]]. By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],&lt;ref name="cra64" /&gt; protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965, which had provisions to enforce the constitutional right to vote for all citizens.

=== Integration of Mississippi universities, 1956–1965 ===
{{Weasel|section|date=May 2010}}

Beginning in 1956, [[Clyde Kennard]], a black [[Korean War]]-veteran, wanted to enroll at Mississippi Southern College (now the [[University of Southern Mississippi]]) under the [[G.I. Bill]] at [[Hattiesburg]]. Dr. [[William David McCain]], the college president, used the [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]], in order to prevent his enrollment by appealing to local black leaders and the segregationist state political establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=handeyside |first1=Hugh |title=What Have We Learned from the Spies of Mississippi? |url=https://www.aclu.org/blog/speakeasy/what-have-we-learned-spies-mississippi |website=American Civil Liberty Union |publisher=ACLU National Security Project |accessdate=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state-funded organization tried to counter the civil rights movement by positively portraying segregationist policies. More significantly, it collected data on activists, harassed them legally, and used economic boycotts against them by threatening their jobs (or causing them to lose their jobs) to try to suppress their work.

Kennard was twice arrested on trumped-up charges, and eventually convicted and sentenced to seven years in the state prison.&lt;ref name="Kennard" /&gt; After three years at [[hard labor]], Kennard was paroled by Mississippi Governor [[Ross Barnett]]. Journalists had investigated his case and publicized the state's mistreatment of his [[colon cancer]].&lt;ref name="Kennard" /&gt;

McCain's role in Kennard's arrests and convictions is unknown.&lt;ref name="Funding"&gt;William H.

He described the blacks' seeking to desegregate Southern schools as "imports" from the North. (Kennard was a native and resident of Hattiesburg.) McCain said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We insist that educationally and socially, we maintain a [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] society...In all fairness, I admit that we are not encouraging Negro voting...The Negroes prefer that control of the government remain in the white man's hands.&lt;ref name="Funding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note: Mississippi had passed a new constitution in 1890 that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] most blacks by changing electoral and voter registration requirements; although it deprived them of constitutional rights authorized under post-Civil War amendments, it survived [[U.S. Supreme Court]] challenges at the time. It was not until after passage of the 1965 [[Voting Rights Act]] that most blacks in Mississippi and other southern states gained federal protection to enforce the constitutional right of citizens to vote.

[[File:James Meredith OleMiss.jpg|thumb|James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals]]

In September 1962, [[James Meredith]] won a lawsuit to secure admission to the previously segregated [[University of Mississippi]]. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26. He was blocked by Mississippi [[List of Governors of Mississippi|Governor]] [[Ross Barnett]], who said, "[N]o school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor." The [[Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] held Barnett and Lieutenant Governor [[Paul B. Johnson Jr.]] in [[Contempt of court|contempt]], ordering them arrested and fined more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v.

Attorney General [[Robert Kennedy]] sent in a force of [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]]. On September 30, 1962, Meredith entered the campus under their escort. Students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks and firing on the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds, and 160 others were injured. President [[John F. Kennedy]] sent regular [[U.S. Army]] forces to the campus to quell the riot. Meredith began classes the day after the troops arrived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis62.htm#1962olmiss "James Meredith Integrates Ole Miss"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004011259/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis62.htm#1962olmiss |date=October 4, 2006 }}, Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennard and other activists continued to work on public university desegregation.

=== Albany Movement, 1961–62 ===
{{Main|Albany Movement}}

The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in [[Albany, Georgia]], in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers faced{{mdash}}and given the derisive nickname "De Lawd" as a result{{mdash}}intervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.

The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of [[Laurie Pritchett]], the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis61.htm#1961albany Albany GA, Movement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707051408/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis61.htm#1961albany |date=July 7, 2010 }}&amp;nbsp;– Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Birmingham campaign, 1963 ===
{{Main|Birmingham campaign}}

The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. Executive Director [[Wyatt Tee Walker]] carefully planned the early strategy and tactics for the campaign. It focused on one goal{{mdash}}the desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany.

The movement's efforts were helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular [[Bull Connor|Eugene "Bull" Connor]], the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.

The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an [[injunction]] barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for [[mass arrest]]s of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis63.htm#1963bham The Birmingham Campaign] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615060449/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis63.htm#1963bham |date=June 15, 2009 }}&amp;nbsp;– Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;

Baton Rouge: LSU Press. {{ISBN|0-8071-2655-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters appealed to the Kennedy administration, which intervened to obtain King's release. King was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child and was released early on April 19.

The campaign, however, faltered as it ran out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. [[James Bevel]], SCLC's Director of Direct Action and Director of Nonviolent Education, then came up with a bold and controversial alternative: to train high school students to take part in the demonstrations. As a result, in what would be called the [[Children's Crusade (civil rights)|Children's Crusade]], more than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to meet at the 16th Street Baptist Church to join the demonstrations. More than six hundred marched out of the church fifty at a time in an attempt to walk to City Hall to speak to Birmingham's mayor about segregation. They were arrested and put into jail.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When Bevel started them marching fifty at a time, Bull Connor finally unleashed police dogs on them and then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. National television networks broadcast the scenes of the dogs attacking demonstrators and the water from the fire hoses knocking down the schoolchildren.

Widespread public outrage led the Kennedy administration to intervene more forcefully in negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.

Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement{{mdash}}the Rev. [[Fred Shuttlesworth]] was particularly critical, since he was sceptical about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. Parts of the white community reacted violently. They [[Gaston Motel bombing|bombed]] the [[Arthur George Gaston|Gaston]] Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, and the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King.

Kennedy prepared to federalize the [[Alabama National Guard]] if the need arose. Four months later, on September 15, a conspiracy of Ku Klux Klan members [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church]] in Birmingham, killing four young girls.

Birmingham was only one of over a hundred cities rocked by the chaotic protest that spring and summer, some of them in the North.

A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on Washington, D.C., in 1941 to support demands for elimination of [[employment discrimination]] in defense industries; he called off the march when the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration met the demand by issuing [[Executive Order 8802]] barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clawson |first1=Laura |title=A.

Randolph and [[Bayard Rustin]] were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. In 1963, the Kennedy administration initially opposed the march out of concern it would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation. However, Randolph and King were firm that the march would proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kennedy, Johnson, and the Quest for Justice: The Civil Rights Tapes |last=Rosenberg |first=Jonathan |first2=Zachary |last2=Karabell |page=130 |isbn=978-0-393-05122-3 |year=2003 |publisher=WW Norton &amp; Co}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the march going forward, the Kennedys decided it was important to work to ensure its success. Concerned about the turnout, President Kennedy enlisted the aid of white church leaders and [[Walter Reuther]], president of the [[United Automobile Workers|UAW]], to help mobilize white supporters for the march.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Robert Kennedy and His Times |last=Schlesinger Jr. |first=Arthur M. |pages=350, 351 |isbn=978-0-618-21928-5 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Books |origyear=1978 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/in-march-on-washington-white-activists-were-largely-overlooked-but-strategically-essential/2013/08/25/f2738c2a-eb27-11e2-8023-b7f07811d98e_story.html |title=In March on Washington, white activists were largely overlooked but strategically essential |last=Thompson |first=Krissah |date=August 25, 2013 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=March 24, 2018  |issn=0190-8286 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320230800/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/in-march-on-washington-white-activists-were-largely-overlooked-but-strategically-essential/2013/08/25/f2738c2a-eb27-11e2-8023-b7f07811d98e_story.html |archive-date=March 20, 2018 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The march was held on August 28, 1963. Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals:
* meaningful civil rights laws
* a massive federal works program
* full and fair employment
* decent housing
* the right to vote
* adequate integrated education.
Of these, the march's major focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.

National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In the essay "The March on Washington and Television News,"&lt;ref name="southernspaces.org"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://southernspaces.org/2004/television-news-and-civil-rights-struggle-views-virginia-and-mississippi |author=William G.

More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.&lt;ref name="southernspaces.org" /&gt;

The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the [[Lincoln Memorial]], where King delivered his famous "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] of [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]] took the administration to task for not doing more to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.

After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the [[White House]]. While the Kennedy administration appeared sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had enough votes in Congress to do so. However, when [[John F. Kennedy assassination|President Kennedy was assassinated]] on November 22, 1963,&lt;ref name="abbeville" /&gt; the new President [[Lyndon B.

In March 1964, [[Malcolm X]] (el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz), national representative of the [[Nation of Islam]], formally broke with that organization, and made a public offer to collaborate with any civil rights organization that accepted the right to self-defense and the philosophy of Black nationalism (which Malcolm said no longer required [[Black separatism]]).

On March 26, 1964, as the Civil Rights Act was facing stiff opposition in Congress, Malcolm had a public meeting with Martin Luther King Jr. at the Capitol. Malcolm had tried to begin a dialog with Dr. King as early as 1957, but King had rebuffed him. Malcolm had responded by calling King an "[[Uncle Tom]]", saying he had turned his back on black militancy in order to appease the white power structure. But the two men were on good terms at their face-to-face meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_malcolm_x_1925_1965/ "Malcolm X", ''The King Encyclopedia'', eds.

Civil rights activists became increasingly combative in the 1963 to 1964 period, seeking to defy such events as the thwarting of the Albany campaign, police repression and Ku Klux Klan [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|terrorism]] in [[Birmingham campaign|Birmingham]], and the assassination of [[Medgar Evers]]. The latter's brother Charles Evers, who took over as Mississippi NAACP Field Director, told a public NAACP conference on February 15, 1964, that "non-violence won't work in Mississippi...we made up our minds...that if a white man shoots at a Negro in Mississippi, we will shoot back."&lt;ref&gt;Akinyele Umoja, ''We Will Shoot Back: Armed Resistance in the Mississippi Freedom Movement'' (NYU Press, 2013), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; The repression of sit-ins in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], provoked a riot in which black youth threw [[Molotov cocktail]]s at police on March 24, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Fox Piven and Richard Cloward, ''Regulating the Poor'' (Random House 1971), p. 238; [https://books.google.com/books?id=bBQvmMnKmbcC&amp;pg=PA118 Abel A.

In his landmark April 1964 speech "[[The Ballot or the Bullet]]", Malcolm presented an ultimatum to white America: "There's new strategy coming in. It'll be Molotov cocktails this month, hand grenades next month, and something else next month.

During the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma campaign]] for voting rights in 1965, Malcolm made it known that he'd heard reports of increased threats of lynching around Selma. In late January he sent an open telegram to [[George Lincoln Rockwell]], the head of the [[American Nazi Party]], stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"if your present racist agitation against our people there in Alabama causes physical harm to Reverend King or any other black Americans...you and your KKK friends will be met with maximum physical retaliation from those of us who are not handcuffed by the disarming philosophy of nonviolence."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EAhHl-0ERn8C&amp;pg=PA92 Christopher Strain, ''Pure Fire:Self-Defense as Activism in the Civil Rights Era'' (University of Georgia Press, 2005), pp. 92–93]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The following month, the Selma chapter of SNCC invited Malcolm to speak to a mass meeting there.

=== St. Augustine, Florida, 1963–64 ===
{{Main|St. Augustine movement}}

[[File:WhiteTradeOnlyLancasterOhio.jpg|thumb|"We Cater to White Trade Only" sign on a restaurant window in [[Lancaster, Ohio]], in 1938. In 1964, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] was arrested and spent a night in jail for attempting to eat at a white-only restaurant in [[St. Augustine, Florida]].]]

[[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] was famous as the "Nation's Oldest City", founded by the Spanish in 1565. It became the stage for a great drama leading up to the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. A local movement, led by Dr. Robert B. Hayling, a black dentist and Air Force veteran affiliated with the NAACP, had been picketing segregated local institutions since 1963. In the fall of 1964, Hayling and three companions were brutally beaten at a Ku Klux Klan rally.

Nightriders shot into black homes, and teenagers Audrey Nell Edwards, JoeAnn Anderson, Samuel White, and Willie Carl Singleton (who came to be known as "The St. Augustine Four") sat in at a local Woolworth's lunch counter, seeking to get served. They were arrested and convicted of trespassing, and sentenced to six months in jail and reform school. It took a special act of the governor and cabinet of Florida to release them after national protests by the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]'', [[Jackie Robinson]], and others.

In response to the repression, the St. Augustine movement practiced armed self-defense in addition to nonviolent direct action. In June 1963, Dr. Hayling publicly stated that "I and the others have armed. We will shoot first and answer questions later. We are not going to die like Medgar Evers." The comment made national headlines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim63b.htm#1963staug Civil Rights Movement Veterans.

In 1964, Dr. Hayling and other activists urged the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] to come to St. Augustine. Four prominent Massachusetts women – Mary Parkman Peabody, Esther Burgess, Hester Campbell (all of whose husbands were Episcopal bishops), and Florence Rowe (whose husband was vice president of [[John Hancock Insurance Company]]) – also came to lend their support. The arrest of Mrs. Peabody, the 72-year-old mother of the governor of Massachusetts, for attempting to eat at the segregated Ponce de Leon Motor Lodge in an integrated group, made front-page news across the country and brought the movement in St. Augustine to the attention of the world.

Widely publicized activities continued in the ensuing months. When Dr. King was arrested, he sent a "Letter from the St. Augustine Jail" to a northern supporter, [[Rabbi Israel Dresner]]. A week later, in the largest mass arrest of rabbis in American history took place, while they were conducting a pray-in at the segregated Monson Motel. A well-known photograph taken in St. Augustine shows the manager of the Monson Motel pouring [[muriatic acid]] in the swimming pool while blacks and whites are swimming in it. The horrifying photograph was run on the front page of a Washington newspaper the day the Senate were to vote on passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

=== Chester School Protests, Spring 1964 ===
In the early 1960s, racial unrest and civil rights protests led by [[George Raymond]] of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored Persons]] (NAACP) and [[Stanley Branche]] of the Committee for Freedom Now (CFFN) made [[Chester, Pennsylvania]] one of the key battlegrounds of the civil rights movement.  [[James Farmer]], the national director of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] called Chester "''the Birmingham of the North''".&lt;ref name=Mele&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mele |first1=Christopher |title=Race and the Politics of Deception: The Making of an American City |date=2017 |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4798-6609-0 |pages=74–100 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAl3DQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Branche and the CFFN focused on improving conditions at the predominantly black Franklin Elementary school in Chester. Although the school was built to house 500 students, it had become overcrowded with 1,200 students. The school's average class-size was 39, twice the number of nearby all-white schools.&lt;ref name=Phoenix&gt;{{cite web |last1=Holcomb |first1=Lindsay |title=Questions surround student activism fifty-two years later |url=https://swarthmorephoenix.com/2015/10/29/questions-surround-student-activism-fifty-two-years-later/ |website=www.swarthmorephoenix.com |accessdate=25 October 2018|date=2015-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was built in 1910 and had never been updated.  Only two bathrooms were available for the entire school.&lt;ref name=nvdbase/&gt;  In November 1963, CFFN protesters blocked the entrance to Franklin Elementary school and the Chester Municipal Building resulting in the arrest of 240 protesters. Following public attention to the protests stoked by media coverage of the mass arrests, the mayor and school board negotiated with the CFFN and NAACP.&lt;ref name=Mele/&gt; The Chester Board of Education agreed to reduce class sizes at Franklin school, remove unsanitary toilet facilities, relocate classes held in the boiler room and coal bin and repair school grounds.&lt;ref name=nvdbase/&gt;

Emboldened by the success of the Franklin Elementary school demonstrations, the CFFN recruited new members, sponsored voter registration drives and planned a citywide boycott of Chester schools. Branche built close ties with students at nearby [[Swarthmore College]], [[Pennsylvania Military College]] and [[Cheyney State College]] in order to ensure large turnouts at demonstrations and protests.&lt;ref name=Mele/&gt; Branche invited [[Dick Gregory]] and [[Malcolm X]] to Chester to participate in the "Freedom Now Conference"&lt;ref name=McLarnon/&gt; and other national civil rights leaders such as [[Gloria Richardson]] came to Chester in support of the demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chester NAACP Scrapbook 1963-1964 |url=http://digitalwolfgram.widener.edu/digital/collection/p270801coll18/id/588 |website=www.digitalwolfgram.widener.edu |accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, a series of almost nightly protests brought chaos to Chester as protestors argued that the Chester School Board had [[de facto]] [[Racial segregation|segregation]] [[School segregation in the United States|of schools]]. The mayor of Chester, [[James Gorbey]], issued "The Police Position to Preserve the Public Peace", a ten-point statement promising an immediate return to law and order.

In November 1964, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission concluded that the Chester School Board had violated the law and ordered the Chester School District to desegregate the city's six predominantly African-American schools.

=== Freedom Summer, 1964 ===
{{Main|Freedom Summer}}

In the summer of 1964, [[Council of Federated Organizations|COFO]] brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi{{mdash}}most of them white college students{{mdash}}to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in "Freedom Schools," and organize the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] (MFDP).&lt;ref name="crmvet.org"&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/disc/mfdp.htm The Mississippi Movement &amp; the MFDP] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424084752/http://www.crmvet.org/disc/mfdp.htm |date=April 24, 2008 }}&amp;nbsp;– Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the [[White Citizens' Council]] and the Ku Klux Klan used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/docs/msrv64.pdf Mississippi: Subversion of the Right to Vote] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505032056/http://www.crmvet.org/docs/msrv64.pdf |date=May 5, 2010 }}&amp;nbsp;– Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FBI Poster of Missing Civil Rights Workers.jpg|thumb|[[Missing persons]] poster created by the [[FBI]] in 1964 shows the photographs of [[Andrew Goodman]], [[James Chaney]], and [[Michael Schwerner]].]]

On June 21, 1964, [[Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner|three civil rights workers disappeared]]: [[James Chaney]], a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two [[Jewish]] activists, [[Andrew Goodman]], a [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] anthropology student; and [[Michael Schwerner]], a [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]] organizer from [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]]. They were found weeks later, murdered by conspirators who turned out to be local members of the Klan, some of them members of the [[Neshoba County, Mississippi|Neshoba County]] sheriff's department. This outraged the public, leading the U.S. Justice Department along with the FBI (the latter which had previously avoided dealing with the issue of segregation and persecution of blacks) to take action. The outrage over these murders helped lead to the passage of the Civil Rights Act.

From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the [[Mississippi Delta]] region. At least 30 Freedom Schools, with close to 3,500 students, were established, and 28 community centers set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McAdam |first=Doug |title=Freedom Summer |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-19-504367-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of the red tape and forces of [[white supremacy]] arrayed against them{{mdash}}only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] (MFDP), founded as an alternative political organization, showing their desire to vote and participate in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Carson |first=Clayborne |title=In Struggle: SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the civil rights movement. It helped break down the decades of people's isolation and repression that were the foundation of the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. The progression of events throughout the South increased media attention to Mississippi.&lt;ref name="crmvet1"&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/vet/vethome.htm Veterans Roll Call] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423070052/http://www.crmvet.org/vet/vethome.htm |date=April 23, 2008 }}&amp;nbsp;– Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;

The deaths of affluent northern white students and threats to other northerners attracted the full attention of the media spotlight to the state. Many black activists became embittered, believing the media valued lives of whites and blacks differently. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers, almost all of whom{{mdash}}black and white{{mdash}}still consider it to have been one of the defining periods of their lives.&lt;ref name="crmvet1" /&gt;

=== Civil Rights Act of 1964 ===
{{Main|Civil Rights Act of 1964}}

Although President Kennedy had [[Civil Rights Address|proposed civil rights legislation]] and it had support from Northern Congressmen and Senators of both parties, Southern Senators blocked the bill by threatening [[filibuster]]s. After considerable parliamentary maneuvering and 54 days of filibuster on the floor of the United States Senate, President Johnson got a bill through the Congress.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=521–524}}

[[File:Lyndon Johnson signing Civil Rights Act, July 2, 1964.jpg|thumb|Lyndon B. Johnson signs the historic [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].]]

On July 2, 1964, Johnson signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],&lt;ref name="cra64" /&gt; which banned discrimination based on "race, color, religion, sex or national origin" in employment practices and public accommodations. The bill authorized the Attorney General to file lawsuits to enforce the new law. The law also nullified state and local laws that required such discrimination.

=== Harlem riot of 1964 ===
{{Main|Harlem riot of 1964}}

When police shot an unarmed black teenager in Harlem in July 1964, tensions escalated out of control. Residents were frustrated with racial inequalities. Rioting broke out, and [[Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bedford-Stuyvesant]], a major black neighborhood in Brooklyn erupted next. That summer, [[1964 Philadelphia race riot|rioting also broke out in Philadelphia]], for similar reasons. The riots were on a much smaller scale than what would occur in 1965 and later.

Washington responded with a pilot program called [[Project Uplift]]. Thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by [[Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited|HARYOU]] called ''[[Youth in the Ghetto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Youth in the Ghetto: A Study of the Consequences of Powerlessness'', Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited, Inc., 1964&lt;/ref&gt; HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the [[National Urban League]] and nearly 100 smaller community organizations.&lt;ref&gt;''Poverty and Politics in Harlem'', Alphnso Pinkney and Roger Woock, College &amp; University Press Services, Inc., 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent jobs at living wages were still out of reach of many young black men.

=== Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964 ===
{{Main|Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party}}

Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 19th century. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election, which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the "Freedom Party" against the official state Democratic Party candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim63b.htm Freedom Ballot in MS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816034441/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim63b.htm |date=August 16, 2016 }}&amp;nbsp;– Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lyndon Johnson meeting with civil rights leaders.jpg|thumb|upright=1.36|President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] ''(center)'' meets with civil rights leaders [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Whitney Young]], and [[James L. Farmer Jr.|James Farmer]], January 1964]]

In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected [[Fannie Lou Hamer]], [[Annie Bell Robinson Devine|Annie Devine]], and [[Victoria Gray Adams|Victoria Gray]] to run for [[United States Congress|Congress]], and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention.&lt;ref name="crmvet.org" /&gt;

The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson administration's achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican [[Barry Goldwater]]'s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the "Solid South", as well as support that [[George Wallace]] had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.

Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There [[Fannie Lou Hamer]] testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, "Is this America?"

Johnson offered the MFDP a "compromise" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the "compromise."

The MFDP kept up its agitation at the convention after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the "regular" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. National party organizers removed them. When they returned the next day, they found convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before. They stayed and sang "freedom songs".

The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the civil rights movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited [[Malcolm X]] to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]].

[[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]] had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in [[Selma, Alabama]], in 1963, but by 1965 little headway had been made in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the SCLC for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police. [[Jimmie Lee Jackson]], a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February 17, 1965. Jackson's death prompted [[James Bevel]], director of the Selma Movement, to initiate and organize a plan to march from Selma to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], the state capital.

On March 7, 1965, acting on Bevel's plan, [[Hosea Williams]] of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87&amp;nbsp;km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Six blocks into the march, at the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] where the marchers left the city and moved into the county, state troopers and local county law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs, [[tear gas]], rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire, and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was [[Amelia Boynton Robinson]], who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.

[[File:Bloody Sunday-Alabama police attack.jpeg|thumb|Police attack non-violent marchers on "Bloody Sunday", the first day of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]].]]

The national broadcast of the news footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers' seeking to exercise their constitutional right to vote provoked a national response, and hundreds of people from all over the country came for a second march. These marchers were turned around by Dr. King at the last minute so as not to violate a federal injunction. With the support of [[James Forman]] and other SNCC leaders, activists throughout the country committed civil disobedience for Selma, particularly in Montgomery and at the White House. The marchers were able to lift the injunction and obtain protection from federal troops, permitting them to make the march across Alabama without incident two weeks later.

The evening of a second march on March 9 to the site of Bloody Sunday, local whites attacked Rev. [[James Reeb]], a voting rights supporter. He died of his injuries in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed [[Detroit]] homemaker [[Viola Liuzzo]] as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.

=== Voting Rights Act, 1965 ===
Eight days after the first march, but before the final march, President Johnson delivered a televised address to support the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:

{{quote|quote=Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.}}

On August 6, Johnson signed the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which suspended literacy tests and other subjective voter registration tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used and where African Americans were historically under-represented in voting rolls compared to the eligible population. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts, which had seldom prosecuted their cases to success. If discrimination in voter registration occurred, the 1965 act authorized the [[Attorney General of the United States]] to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars.

Within months of the bill's passage, 250,000 new black voters had been registered, one-third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout at 74% and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout among black voters; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.

Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966 [[Jim Clark (sheriff)|Sheriff Jim Clark]] of Selma, Alabama, infamous for using [[cattle prod]]s against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious "Never" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as blacks voted to get him out of office.

Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every [[Black Belt (U.S. region)|Black Belt]] county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions in city, county, and state governments.

Atlanta elected a black mayor, [[Andrew Young]], as did [[Jackson, Mississippi]], with [[Harvey Johnson Jr.]], and [[New Orleans]], with [[Ernest Nathan Morial|Ernest Morial]]. Black politicians on the national level included [[Barbara Jordan]], elected as a Representative from Texas in Congress, and President Jimmy Carter appointed Andrew Young as [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]]. [[Julian Bond]] was elected to the [[Georgia General Assembly|Georgia State Legislature]] in 1965, although political reaction to his public [[opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War]] prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] was first elected in 1986 to represent [[Georgia's 5th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]], where he has served since 1987.

=== Watts riot of 1965 ===
{{Main|Watts Riots}}

[[File:Wattsriots-policearrest-loc.jpg|thumb|Police arrest a man during the [[Watts Riots]], August 1965]]

The new Voting Rights Act of 1965 had no immediate effect on living conditions for poor blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the [[South Los Angeles|South Central]] Los Angeles neighborhood of [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]]. Like Harlem, Watts was a majority-black neighborhood with very high unemployment and associated poverty. Its residents confronted a largely white police department that had a history of abuse against blacks.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Crump, ''Black riot in Los Angeles: the story of the Watts tragedy'' (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The spark triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the [[Watts Riots]] among the most expensive in American history.

With black militancy on the rise, ghetto residents directed acts of anger at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]], whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers. Riots among blacks occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as [[Atlanta]], [[San Francisco]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Baltimore]], [[Seattle]], [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Hough Riots|Cleveland]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[1967 Newark riots|Newark]], Chicago, New York City (specifically in [[Brooklyn]], Harlem and [[the Bronx]]), and worst of all in Detroit.

=== Fair housing movements, 1966–1968 ===
The first major blow against housing segregation in the era, the Rumford Fair Housing Act, was passed in California in 1963. It was overturned by white California voters and real estate lobbyists the following year with [[California Proposition 14 (1964)|Proposition 14]], a move which helped precipitate the [[Watts Riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8MeAgAAQBAJ |title=American Babylon: Race and the Struggle for Postwar Oakland |first=Robert O. |last=Self |date=August 8, 2005 |publisher=Princeton University Press |accessdate=July 29, 2016 |via=Google Books |isbn=978-1-4008-4417-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/aug/11/local/la-me-watts11aug11 |title=Watts Riots, 40 Years Later |first1=Valerie |last1=Reitman |first2=Mitchell |last2=Landsberg |date=August 11, 2005 |accessdate=July 29, 2016 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]] invalidated Proposition 14 and reinstated the Fair Housing Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt0b69q1bw/entire_text/ |title=No on Proposition 14: California Fair Housing Initiative Collection |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working and organizing for [[fair housing]] laws became a major project of the movement over the next two years, with Martin Luther King Jr., James Bevel, and [[Al Raby]] leading the [[Chicago Freedom Movement]] around the issue in 1966. In the following year, Father [[James Groppi]] and the [[NAACP Youth Council]] also attracted national attention with a fair housing campaign in Milwaukee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackthursday.uwosh.edu/milwaukee.html |title=Black Thursday |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-11-05/news/mn-4337_1_roman-catholic-priest |title=James Groppi, Ex-Priest, Civil Rights Activist, Dies |first=Burt A. |last=Folkart |date=November 5, 1985 |accessdate=July 29, 2016 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both movements faced violent resistance from white homeowners and legal opposition from conservative politicians.

The Fair Housing Bill was the most contentious civil rights legislation of the era. Senator [[Walter Mondale]], who advocated for the bill, noted that over successive years, it was the most [[filibuster]]ed legislation in U.S. history. It was opposed by most Northern and Southern senators, as well as the National Association of Real Estate Boards. A proposed "Civil Rights Act of 1966" had collapsed completely because of its fair housing provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wiu.edu/cas/history/wihr/pdfs/MilesWIHRSp09.pdf |title=Darren Miles "Everett Dirksen's Role in Civil Rights Legislation" Western Illinois Historical Review, Vol. I Spring 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mondale commented that:

=== Nationwide riots of 1967 ===
{{Main|Detroit Riot of 1967|1967 Newark riots|1967 Plainfield riots|Long Hot Summer of 1967}}

In 1967 riots broke out in black neighborhoods in more than 100 U.S. cities, including Detroit, Newark, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thirteen.org/newark/history3.html |title=A Walk Through Newark. History. The Riots|publisher=Thirteen/WNET |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest of these was the [[1967 Detroit riot]].

In Detroit, a large [[black middle class]] had begun to develop among those African Americans who worked at unionized jobs in the automotive industry. These workers complained of persisting racist practices, iimiting the jobs they could have and opportunities for promotion. The [[United Auto Workers]] channelled these complaints into bureaucratic and ineffective grievance procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=3527 |title=Review of Georgakas, Dan; Surkin, Marvin, ''Detroit, I Do Mind Dying: A Study in Urban Revolution'' |first=Karen |last=Miller |date=October 1, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Violent white mobs enforced the segregation of housing up through the 1960s.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/eyesontheprize/profiles/57_mi.html |title=American Experience.Eyes on the Prize.Profiles&amp;nbsp;– PBS |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blacks who were not upwardly mobile were living in substandard conditions, subject to the same problems as poor African Americans in Watts and Harlem.

When white [[Detroit Police Department]] (DPD) officers shut down an illegal bar and arrested a large group of patrons during the hot summer, furious black residents rioted. Rioters looted and destroyed property while snipers engaged in firefights from rooftops and windows, undermining the DPD's ability to curtail the disorder. In response, the [[Michigan Army National Guard]] and [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[paratrooper]]s were deployed to reinforce the DPD and protect [[Detroit Fire Department]] (DFD) firefighters from attacks while putting out fires. Residents reported that police officers and National Guardsmen shot at black civilians and suspects indiscriminately. After five days, 43 people had been killed, hundreds injured, and thousands left homeless; $40 to $45 million worth of damage was caused.&lt;ref name="pbs.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hubert G. Locke, ''The Detroit Riot of 1967'' (Wayne State University Press, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

State and local governments responded to the riot with a dramatic increase in minority hiring.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Fine, ''Expanding the Frontier of Civil Rights: Michigan, 1948–1968'' (Wayne State University Press, 2000) p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the turmoil, the Greater Detroit Board of Commerce also launched a campaign to find jobs for ten thousand "previously unemployable" persons, a preponderant number of whom were black.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dTfA5R1m0XoC&amp;pg=PA335 Sidney Fine, ''Expanding the Frontier of Civil Rights: Michigan, 1948–1968'' (Wayne State University Press, 2000), p. 326]&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[George Romney (politician)|George Romney]] immediately responded to the riot of 1967 with a special session of the Michigan legislature where he forwarded sweeping housing proposals that included not only [[fair housing]], but "important relocation, [[tenant rights|tenants' rights]] and code enforcement legislation." Romney had supported such proposals in 1965, but abandoned them in the face of organized opposition. The laws passed both houses of the legislature. Historian Sidney Fine wrote that:

{{quote|The Michigan Fair Housing Act, which took effect on November 15, 1968, was stronger than the federal fair housing law...It is probably more than a coincidence that the state that had experienced the most severe racial disorder of the 1960s also adopted one of the strongest state fair housing acts.&lt;ref name="law.msu.edu"&gt;[https://www.law.msu.edu/clinics/rhc/MI_Housing_Disc.pdf Sidney Fine, "Michigan and Housing Discrimination 1949–1969" Michigan Historical Review, Fall 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504011411/http://www.law.msu.edu//clinics/rhc/MI_Housing_Disc.pdf |date=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

President Johnson created the [[Kerner Commission|National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders]] in response to nationwide wave of riots. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public policy in black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.

[[James Lawson (American activist)|Rev. James Lawson]] invited King to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], in March 1968 to support a [[Memphis Sanitation Strike|sanitation workers' strike]]. These workers launched a campaign for [[trade union|union]] representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job; they were seeking fair wages and improved working conditions. King considered their struggle to be a vital part of the [[Poor People's Campaign]] he was planning.

A day after delivering his stirring "[[I've Been to the Mountaintop]]" sermon, which has become famous for his vision of American society, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. [[King assassination riots|Riots broke out]] in black neighborhoods in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably [[1968 Chicago riots|in Chicago]], [[Baltimore riot of 1968|Baltimore]], and [[1968 Washington, D.C., riots|Washington, D.C.]]

The day before [[Funeral of Martin Luther King Jr.|King's funeral]], April 8, [[Coretta Scott King]] and three of the King children led 20,000 marchers through the streets of Memphis, holding signs that read, "Honor King: End Racism" and "Union Justice Now". Armed National Guardsmen lined the streets, sitting on [[M-48 tanks]], to protect the marchers, and helicopters circled overhead. On April 9, Mrs. King led another 150,000 people in a funeral procession through the streets of Atlanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAcoretta.htm |title=Coretta Scott King |publisher=Spartacus Educational Publishers |accessdate=October 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705051610/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAcoretta.htm |archivedate=July 5, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her dignity revived courage and hope in many of the Movement's members, confirming her place as the new leader in the struggle for racial equality.

Rev. [[Ralph Abernathy]] succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

=== Civil Rights Act of 1968 ===
{{Main|Civil Rights Act of 1968}}

As 1968 began, the fair housing bill was being [[filibustered]] once again, but two developments revived it.&lt;ref name="propublica.org" /&gt; The [[Kerner Commission]] report on the [[Long hot summer of 1967|1967 ghetto riots]] was delivered to Congress on March 1, and it strongly recommended "a comprehensive and enforceable federal open housing law" as a remedy to the civil disturbances.

As the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] deliberated the bill in April, Dr. King was assassinated, and the largest [[King assassination riots|wave of unrest]] since the Civil War swept the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.temple.edu/tempress/chapters_1800/2148_ch1.pdf Peter B.

{{quote|quote=some Senators and Representatives publicly stated they would not be intimidated or rushed into legislating because of the disturbances.

Members of Congress knew they had to act to redress these imbalances in American life to fulfil the dream that King had so eloquently preached.&lt;ref name="huduser.org" /&gt;}}

The House passed the legislation on April 10, and President Johnson signed it the next day. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]] prohibited discrimination concerning the sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, religion, and national origin. It also made it a federal crime to "by force or by threat of force, injure, intimidate, or interfere with anyone...by reason of their race, color, religion, or national origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-82/pdf/STATUTE-82-Pg73.pdf |title=Public Law 90-284, Government Printing Office }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Movements, politics, and white reactions ==

=== Grassroots leadership ===
[[File:Fannie Lou Hamer 1964-08-22.jpg|thumb|[[Fannie Lou Hamer]] of the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] (and other Mississippi-based organizations) is an example of local grassroots leadership in the movement.]]

While most popular representations of the movement are centered on the leadership and philosophy of Martin Luther King Jr., some scholars note that the movement was too diverse to be credited to one person, organization, or strategy. Sociologist [[Doug McAdam]] has stated that, "in King's case, it would be inaccurate to say that he was the leader of the modern civil rights movement...but more importantly, there was no singular civil rights movement. The movement was, in fact, a coalition of thousands of local efforts nationwide, spanning several decades, hundreds of discrete groups, and all manner of strategies and tactics{{mdash}}legal, illegal, institutional, non-institutional, violent, non-violent. Without discounting King's importance, it would be sheer fiction to call him the leader of what was fundamentally an amorphous, fluid, dispersed movement."&lt;ref name="bostonreview.net"&gt;[http://www.bostonreview.net/forum/occupy-future/what-should-sustained-movement-look Doug McAdam "Occupy the Future:What Should a Sustained Movement Look Like?"

=== Black power (1966–1968) ===
{{Main|Black Power|Black Power movement}}

During the Freedom Summer campaign of 1964, numerous tensions within the civil rights movement came to the forefront. Many blacks in [[SNCC]] developed concerns that white activists from the North were taking over the movement. The participation by numerous white students was not reducing the amount of violence that SNCC suffered, but seemed to exacerbate it. Additionally, there was profound disillusionment at Lyndon Johnson's denial of voting status for the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party at the Democratic National Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/384127 |title=SNCC, the Federal Government &amp; the Road to Black Power |accessdate=July 29, 2016|last1=Davies |first1=Tom Adam }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studythepast.com/4333_spring12/acrm/ACRM%205.1.pdf |title=Allen J. Matusow "From Civil Rights to Black Power: The Case of SNCC", in ''Twentieth Century America: Recent Interpretations'' (Harcourt Press, 1972), pp. 367–378 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, during [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]]'s work in Louisiana that summer, that group found the federal government would not respond to requests to enforce the provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or to protect the lives of activists who challenged segregation. The Louisiana campaign survived by relying on a local African-American militia called the [[Deacons for Defense and Justice]], who used arms to repel white supremacist violence and police repression. CORE's collaboration with the Deacons was effective in disrupting Jim Crow in numerous Louisiana areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/any-means-necessary?page=0,0 |title=By Any Means Necessary |journal=The Nation |accessdate=July 29, 2016 |via=The Nation|date=2004-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/us/25hicks.html Douglas Martin, "Robert Hicks, Leader in Armed Rights Group, Dies at 81" ''The New York Times'', April 24, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, SNCC helped organize an independent political party, the [[Lowndes County, Alabama|Lowndes County]] Freedom Organization (LCFO), in the heart of the Alabama Black Belt, also Klan territory. It permitted its black leaders to openly promote the use of armed self-defense. Meanwhile, the Deacons for Defense and Justice expanded into Mississippi and assisted [[Charles Evers]]' NAACP chapter with a successful campaign in [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]]. Charles had taken the lead after his brother [[Medgar Evers]] was assassinated in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8H9Me8LZ488C&amp;pg=PA206 Lance Hill, ''The Deacons for Defense: Armed Resistance and the Civil Rights Movement'' (University of North Carolina Press, 2006) pp. 200–204]&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, the 1965 [[Watts Rebellion]] took place in Los Angeles.

During the [[March Against Fear]] in 1966, initiated by [[James Meredith]], SNCC and CORE fully embraced the slogan of "black power" to describe these trends towards militancy and self-reliance. In Mississippi, Stokely Carmichael declared, "I'm not going to beg the white man for anything that I deserve, I'm going to take it. We need power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/eyesontheprize/about/pt_201.html |title=American Experience. ''Eyes on the Prize''. Transcript|publisher=PBS |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people engaging in the Black Power movement claimed a growing sense of black pride and identity. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as "Negroes" but as "Afro-Americans," similar to other ethnic groups, such as Irish Americans and Italian Americans. Until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and often [[Hair straightening|straightened their hair]]. As a part of affirming their identity, blacks started to wear African-based [[dashiki]]s and grow their hair out as a natural [[afro]]. The afro, sometimes nicknamed the "'fro," remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s. Other variations of traditional African styles have become popular, often featuring braids, extensions, and dreadlocks.

The [[Black Panther Party]] (BPP), which was founded by [[Huey Newton]] and [[Bobby Seale]] in [[Oakland, California]], in 1966, gained the most attention for Black Power nationally. The group began following the revolutionary pan-Africanism of late-period [[Malcolm X]], using a "by-any-means necessary" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African-American neighborhoods of [[police brutality]] and to establish [[socialist]] [[dual power (leftist theory)|community control]] in the ghettos. While they conducted armed confrontation with police, they also set up free breakfast and healthcare programs for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4KogCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA273 |title=We Are an African People: Independent Education, Black Power, and the Radical Imagination |last=Rickford |first=Russell |date=January 14, 2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-986148-4 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1968 and 1971, the BPP was one of the most important black organizations in the country and had support from the NAACP, SCLC, [[Peace and Freedom Party]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=D7UwDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118 |title=Black Against Empire: The History and Politics of the Black Panther Party |last=Bloom |first=Joshua |last2=Martin |first2=Waldo E. |date=October 25, 2016 |publisher=Univ of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-29328-1 |location= |pages=223–236 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Power was taken to another level inside prison walls. In 1966, [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]] formed the [[Black Guerrilla Family]] in the California [[San Quentin State Prison]]. The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty of shooting and killing three black prisoners from the prison tower. They retaliated by killing a white prison guard.

Numerous popular cultural expressions associated with black power appeared at this time. Released in August 1968, the number one [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs|Rhythm &amp; Blues single]] for the [[Billboard Year-End]] list was [[James Brown]]'s "[[Say It Loud&amp;nbsp;– I'm Black and I'm Proud]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot+R%26B/Hip-Hop+Songs&amp;g=Year-end+Singles&amp;year=1968 |title=Year End Charts&amp;nbsp;– Year-end Singles&amp;nbsp;– Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs |work=Billboard |accessdate=September 8, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211040751/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot+R&amp;B%2FHip-Hop+Songs&amp;g=Year-end+Singles&amp;year=1968 |archivedate=December 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1968, [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]], while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony.

King was not comfortable with the "Black Power" slogan, which sounded too much like [[black nationalism]] to him. When King was assassinated in 1968, Stokely Carmichael said that whites had murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. Riots broke out in more than 100 cities across the country. Some cities did not recover from the damage for more than a generation; other city neighborhoods never recovered.

=== Black conservatism ===
Despite the common notion that the ideas of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Malcolm X]] and [[Black Power]] only conflicted with each other and were the only ideologies of the civil rights movement, there were other sentiments felt by many blacks. Fearing the events during the movement were occurring too quickly, there were some blacks who felt that leaders should take their activism at a slower pace. Others had reservations on how focused blacks were on the movement and felt that such attention was better spent on reforming issues within the black community.

Those who blatantly rejected integration had various rationales for doing so, such as fearing a change in the status quo they had been used to for so long or fearing for their safety if they found themselves in environments where whites were much more present. Some defended segregation for the sake of keeping ties with the white power structure from which many relied on for social and economic mobility above other blacks. Based on her interpretation of a 1966 study made by Donald Matthews and James Prothro detailing the relative percentage of blacks for integration, against it or feeling something else, Lauren Winner asserts that:

{{quote|quote=Black defenders of segregation look, at first blush, very much like black nationalists, especially in their preference for all-black institutions; but black defenders of segregation differ from nationalists in two key ways. First, while both groups criticize [[NAACP]]-style integration, nationalists articulate a third alternative to integration and [[Jim Crow]], while segregationists preferred to stick with the status quo. Second, absent from black defenders of segregation's political vocabulary was the demand for [[self-determination]]. They called for all-black institutions, but not autonomous all-black institutions; indeed, some defenders of segregation asserted that black people needed white paternalism and oversight in order to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, Lauren F.

Oftentimes, African-American community leaders would be staunch defenders of segregation. Church ministers, businessmen and educators were among those who wished to keep segregation and segregationist ideals in order to retain the privileges they gained from patronage from whites, such as monetary gains. In addition, they relied on segregation to keep their jobs and economies in their communities thriving. It was feared that if integration became widespread in the South, black-owned businesses and other establishments would lose a large chunk of their customer base to white-owned businesses, and many blacks would lose opportunities for jobs that were presently exclusive to their interests.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, Doubtless Sincere, 164–165.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there were the everyday, average black people who criticized integration as well. For them, they took issue with different parts of the civil rights movement and the potential for blacks to exercise consumerism and economic liberty without hindrance from whites.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, Doubtless Sincere, 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and other leading activists and groups during the movement, these opposing viewpoints acted as an obstacle against their ideas. These different views made such leaders' work much harder to accomplish, but they were nonetheless important in the overall scope of the movement. For the most part, the black individuals who had reservations on various aspects of the movement and ideologies of the activists were not able to make a game-changing dent in their efforts, but the existence of these alternate ideas gave some blacks an outlet to express their concerns about the changing social structure.

=== Avoiding the "Communist" label ===
{{See also|The Communist Party and African-Americans}}

On December 17, 1951, the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]]–affiliated [[Civil Rights Congress]] delivered the petition ''[[We Charge Genocide]]: "The Crime of Government Against the Negro People"'', often shortened to ''We Charge Genocide'', to the United Nations in 1951, arguing that the U.S. federal government, by its failure to act against [[lynching in the United States]], was guilty of [[genocide]] under Article II of the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|UN Genocide Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis51.htm ''We Charge Genocide''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402015621/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis51.htm |date=April 2, 2008 }}&amp;nbsp;– Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was presented to the United Nations at two separate venues: [[Paul Robeson]], concert singer and activist, to a UN official in New York City, while [[William L. Patterson]], executive director of the CRC, delivered copies of the drafted petition to a UN delegation in Paris.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1981"&gt;{{cite book |last=Carson |first=Clayborne |title=In Struggle: SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patterson, the editor of the petition, was a leader in the Communist Party USA and head of the [[International Labor Defense]], a group that offered legal representation to communists, trade unionists, and African Americans in cases involving issues of political or racial persecution. The ILD was known for leading the defense of the Scottsboro boys in Alabama in 1931, where the Communist Party had considerable influence among African Americans in the 1930s. This had largely declined by the late 1950s, although they could command international attention. As earlier civil rights figures such as Robeson, Du Bois and Patterson became more politically radical (and therefore targets of Cold War anti-Communism by the U.S. Government), they lost favor with both mainstream Black America and the NAACP.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1981" /&gt;

In order to secure a place in the mainstream and gain the broadest base, the new generation of civil rights activists believed they had to openly distance themselves from anything and anyone associated with the Communist party. According to Ella Baker, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference adopted "Christian" into its name to deter charges of Communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/sohp/html_use/G-0007.html |title=Oral History Interview with Ella Baker, September 4, 1974.

Edgar Hoover]] had been concerned about communism since the early 20th century, and continued to label as "Communist" or "subversive" some of the civil rights activists, whom it kept under close surveillance. In the early 1960s, the practice of distancing the civil rights movement from "Reds" was challenged by the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] who adopted a policy of accepting assistance and participation by anyone, regardless of political affiliation, who supported the SNCC program and was willing to "put their body on the line." At times this political openness put SNCC at odds with the NAACP.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1981" /&gt;

=== Kennedy administration, 1961–1963 ===
[[File:Robert Kennedy speaking before a crowd, June 14, 1963.jpg|thumb|[[Attorney General]] Robert Kennedy speaking before a hostile Civil Rights crowd protesting low [[Affirmative action in the United States|minority hiring]] in his [[Justice Department]] June 14, 1963&lt;ref name="Risen 2014 76"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOu1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76 |title=The Bill of the Century: The Epic Battle for the Civil Rights Act |last=Risen |first=Clay |date=2014 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA |isbn=978-1-60819-824-5 |location= |pages=76 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

For the first two years of the Kennedy administration, civil rights activists had mixed opinions of both the president and [[attorney general]], [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. A well of historical skepticism toward liberal politics had left African Americans with a sense of uneasy disdain for any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom, particularly ones connected to the historically pro-segregationist Democratic Party. Still, many were encouraged by the discreet support Kennedy gave to Dr. King, and the administration's willingness, after dramatic pressure from civil disobedience, to bring forth racially progressive initiatives.

Many of the initiatives resulted from Robert Kennedy's passion. The younger Kennedy gained a rapid education in the realities of racism through events such as the [[Baldwin-Kennedy meeting]]. The president came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matter, resulting in the landmark [[Civil Rights Address]] of June 1963 and the introduction of the first major civil rights act of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;James Hilty, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Za8TAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA356 ''Robert Kennedy: Brother Protector''] (Temple University Press, 2000), p. 350-361.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, Arthur Jr, ''Robert Kennedy And His Times'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Kennedy first became concerned with civil rights in mid-May 1961 during the [[Freedom Rides]], when photographs of the burning bus and savage beatings in [[Anniston, Alabama|Anniston]] and Birmingham were broadcast around the world. They came at an especially embarrassing time, as President Kennedy was about to have a [[Vienna summit|summit with the Soviet premier]] in Vienna. The White House was concerned with its image among the populations of newly independent nations in Africa and Asia, and Robert Kennedy responded with an address for [[Voice of America]] stating that great progress had been made on the issue of race relations. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the administration worked to resolve the crisis with a minimum of violence and prevent the Freedom Riders from generating a fresh crop of headlines that might divert attention from the President's international agenda. The [[Freedom Riders (film)|''Freedom Riders'']] documentary notes that, "The back burner issue of civil rights had collided with the urgent demands of Cold War [[realpolitik]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/freedomriders/issues/the-cold-war "Freedom Riders-The Cold War" ''Freedom Riders'', American Experience, PBS website]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21, when a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King was holding out with protesters, Robert Kennedy telephoned King to ask him to stay in the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for "allowing the situation to continue". King later publicly thanked Kennedy for deploying the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.

With a very small majority in Congress, the president's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Without the support of Vice-President Johnson, a former Senator who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed.

By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives, including administrative representation across all U.S. Government departments and greater access to the ballot box. From squaring off against Governor [[George Wallace]], to "tearing into" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the civil rights movement. He continued to work on these social justice issues in his bid for the presidency in 1968.

On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation to African-American enrollment at the [[University of Alabama]], President Kennedy gave an [[Civil Rights Address|address]] to the nation, which marked the changing tide, an address that was to become a landmark for the ensuing change in political policy as to civil rights. In 1966, Robert Kennedy visited South Africa and voiced his objections to [[apartheid]], the first time a major US politician had done so:

{{quote|quote=At the [[University of Natal]] in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve. "But suppose God is black", I replied. "What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?" There was no answer. Only silence.|Robert Kennedy |''LOOK'' Magazine&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfksa.org/magazines/magazine.php?id=6 Ripple of Hope in the Land of Apartheid: Robert Kennedy in South Africa, June 1966] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050313181151/http://www.rfksa.org/magazines/magazine.php?id=6 |date=March 13, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Robert Kennedy's relationship with the movement was not always positive. As attorney general, he was called to account by activists—who booed him at a June 1963 speech—for the Justice Department's own poor record of hiring blacks.&lt;ref name="Risen 2014 76" /&gt; He also presided over [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Director]] [[J.

=== American Jewish community and the civil rights movement ===
{{See also|African American–Jewish relations|New York City teachers' strike of 1968|Brownsville, Brooklyn}}

[[File:March on washington Aug 28 1963.jpg|thumb|Jewish civil rights activist [[Joseph L. Rauh Jr.]] marching with [[Martin Luther King]] in 1963]]

Many in the [[American Jews|Jewish]] community supported the civil rights movement. In fact, statistically Jews were one of the most actively involved non-black groups in the Movement. Many Jewish students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi [[Freedom Summer]] project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/itvs/fromswastikatojimcrow/relations.html ''From Swastika to Jim Crow''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722212600/http://www.pbs.org/itvs/fromswastikatojimcrow/relations.html |date=July 22, 2015 }}—PBS Documentary&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish leaders were arrested while heeding a call from Martin Luther King Jr. in [[St. Augustine, Florida]], in June 1964, where the largest mass arrest of rabbis in American history took place at the Monson Motor Lodge{{mdash}}a nationally important civil rights landmark that was demolished in 2003 so that a Hilton Hotel could be built on the site. [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], a writer, rabbi, and professor of theology at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York, was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches#The march to Montgomery|Selma to Montgomery march]]. In the 1964 [[murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner]], the two white activists killed, [[Andrew Goodman]] and [[Michael Schwerner]], were both Jewish.

[[Brandeis University]], the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP) in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the university's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.

The [[American Jewish Committee]], [[American Jewish Congress]], and [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) actively promoted civil rights. While Jews were very active in the civil rights movement in the South, in the North, many had experienced a more strained relationship with African Americans. In communities experiencing white flight, racial rioting, and urban decay, Jewish Americans were more often the last remaining whites in the communities most affected.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} It has been argued that with Black militancy and the [[Black Power]] movements on the rise, "Black Anti-Semitism" increased leading to strained relations between Blacks and Jews in Northern communities. In New York City, most notably, there was a major socio-economic class difference in the perception of African Americans by Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Cannato, Vincent "The Ungovernable City: John Lindsay and his struggle to save New York" Better Books, 2001. {{ISBN|0-465-00843-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jews from better educated Upper Middle Class backgrounds were often very supportive of African American civil rights activities while the Jews in poorer urban communities that became increasingly minority were often less supportive largely in part due to more negative and violent interactions between the two groups.

According to political scientist [[Michael Rogin]], Jewish-Black hostility was a two-way street extending to earlier decades. In the post-World War II era, Jews were granted [[white privilege]] and most moved into the middle-class while Blacks were left behind in the ghetto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How Jews Became White Folks and What That Says About Race in America |author=Karen Brodkin |date=2000 |publisher=Rutgers University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban Jews engaged in the same sort of conflicts with Blacks—over [[integration busing]], local control of schools, housing, crime, communal identity, and class divides—that other [[white ethnics]] did, leading to Jews participating in [[white flight]]. The culmination of this was the [[1968 New York City teachers' strike]], pitting largely Jewish schoolteachers against predominantly Black parents in [[Brownsville, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=va8wDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA263 |title=Blackface, White Noise: Jewish Immigrants in the Hollywood Melting Pot |last=Rogin |first=Michael |date=May 29, 1998 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-21380-7 |location= |pages=262–267 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Profile ====
Many Jewish individuals in the Southern states who supported civil rights for African Americans tended to keep a low profile on "the race issue", in order to avoid attracting the attention of the anti-Black and antisemitic Ku Klux Klan.&lt;ref name="My Jewish Learning" /&gt; However, Klan groups exploited the issue of African-American integration and Jewish involvement in the struggle to launch acts of violent antisemitism. As an example of this hatred, in one year alone, from November 1957 to October 1958, temples and other Jewish communal gatherings were bombed and desecrated in Atlanta, Nashville, Jacksonville, and Miami, and dynamite was found under synagogues in Birmingham, [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], and [[Gastonia, North Carolina]]. Some rabbis received death threats, but there were no injuries following these outbursts of violence.&lt;ref name="My Jewish Learning"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sachar |first1=Howard |title=A History of Jews in America |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history/Modern_History/1948-1980/America/Liberal_Politics/Black-Jewish_Relations/Civil_Rights_Movement.shtml?p=2 |website=myjewishlearning.com |publisher=Vintage Books |accessdate=March 1, 2015 |date=November 2, 1993 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140721012334/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history/Modern_History/1948-1980/America/Liberal_Politics/Black-Jewish_Relations/Civil_Rights_Movement.shtml?p=2 |archivedate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== White backlash ===
King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.

King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.

King's attempts to broaden the scope of the civil rights movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]] marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to "study" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding "white power" signs in notoriously racist [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]], a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against [[housing segregation]].&lt;ref name="Urgency 7"&gt;{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w835AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT128 |title=The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society |last=Zelizer |first=Julian E. |date=January 8, 2015 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-1-101-60549-3 |location= |pages= |chapter=Chapter Seven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politicians and journalists quickly blamed this white [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]] on the movement's shift towards Black Power in the mid-1960s; today most scholars view backlash as a phenomenon that was already developing in the mid-1950s, embodied in the "[[massive resistance]]" movement of the South where even the few moderate white leaders (including George Wallace, who had once been endorsed by the NAACP) shifted to openly racist positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://networks.h-net.org/node/16794/reviews/17020/gillman-klarman-jim-crow-civil-rights-supreme-court-and-struggle-racial |title=Gillman on Klarman, 'From Jim Crow to Civil Rights:  The Supreme Court and the Struggle for Racial Equality' {{!}} H-Law {{!}} H-Net|website=networks.h-net.org|access-date=March 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326202852/https://networks.h-net.org/node/16794/reviews/17020/gillman-klarman-jim-crow-civil-rights-supreme-court-and-struggle-racial|archive-date=March 26, 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2000/marchapril/feature/racism-redemption |title=Racism to Redemption |website=National Endowment for the Humanities  |access-date=March 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171210064143/https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2000/marchapril/feature/racism-redemption |archive-date=December 10, 2017 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Northern racists opposed the southerners on a regional and cultural basis, but also held segregationist attitudes which became more pronounced as the civil rights movement headed North. For instance, prior to the Watts riot, California whites had already mobilized to [[California Proposition 14 (1964)|repeal the state's 1963 fair housing law]].&lt;ref name="Urgency 7" /&gt;

Even so, the backlash was not sufficient at the time to roll back major civil rights victories or swing the country into reaction. Social historians Matthew Lassiter and [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] note that backlash's primary constituency was [[suburban]] and middle-class, but not working-class whites: "among the white electorate, one half of blue-collar voters…cast their ballot for [the liberal presidential candidate] Hubert Humphrey in 1968…only in the South did [[George Wallace]] draw substantially more blue-collar than white-collar support."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_a0EAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6 |title=The Silent Majority: Suburban Politics in the Sunbelt South |last=Lassiter |first=Matthew D. |date=October 24, 2013 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-1-4008-4942-0 |location= |pages=6–7, 302–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Long-run impact ===
A 2018 study in the ''American Journal of Political Science'' found that civil rights protest activity had a meaningful persistent impact on attitudes in the long-run. The study found that "whites from counties that experienced historical civil rights protests are more likely to identify as Democrats and support affirmative action, and less likely to harbor racial resentment against blacks... counties that experienced civil rights protests are associated with greater Democratic Party vote shares even today."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazumder|first=Soumyajit|date=2018-08-30|title=The Persistent Effect of U.S. Civil Rights Protests on Political Attitudes|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=62|issue=4|pages=922–935|language=en|doi=10.1111/ajps.12384|issn=0092-5853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Johnson administration: 1963–1968 ==
{{Further|Civil Rights Act of 1964|War on Poverty|Lyndon B. Johnson}}

Lyndon Johnson made civil rights one of his highest priorities, coupling it with a whites war on poverty. However in creasing the shrill opposition to the War in Vietnam, coupled with the cost of the war, undercut support for his domestic programs.&lt;ref&gt;David Zarefsky, ''President Johnson's war on poverty: Rhetoric and history'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Kennedy, major civil rights legislation had been stalled in Congress his assassination changed everything. On one hand president Lyndon Johnson was a much more skillful negotiator than Kennedy but he had behind him a powerful national momentum demanding immediate action on moral and emotional grounds. Demands for immediate action originated from unexpected directions, especially white Protestant church groups. The Justice Department, led by Robert Kennedy, moved from a posture of defending Kennedy from the quagmire minefield of racial politics to acting to fulfill his legacy. The violent death and public reaction dramatically moved the moderate Republicans, led by Senator [[Everett McKinley Dirksen]], whose support was the margin of victory for the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The act immediately ended de jure (legal) segregation and the era of Jim Crow.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Ling, "What a difference a death makes: JFK, LBJ, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964." ''The Sixties'' 8#2 (2015): 121–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the civil rights movement at full blast, Lyndon Johnson coupled black entrepreneurship with his war on poverty, setting up special program in the Small Business Administration, the Office of Economic Opportunity, and other agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Weems Jr., ''Business in Black and White: American Presidents and Black Entrepreneurs'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; This time there was money for loans designed to boost minority business ownership. Richard Nixon greatly expanded the program, setting up the Office of Minority Business Enterprise (OMBE) in the expectation that black entrepreneurs would help defuse racial tensions and possibly support his reelection .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Douglas Schoen |title=The Nixon Effect: How His Presidency Has Changed American Politics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgRDCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT34 |year=2015 |publisher=Encounter Books |pages=34–35 |isbn=978-1-59403-800-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prison reform ==

=== ''Gates v. Collier'' ===
[[File:MississippiStatePen.jpg|thumb|[[Mississippi State Penitentiary]]]]

Conditions at the [[Mississippi State Penitentiary]] at Parchman, then known as Parchman Farm, became part of the public discussion of civil rights after activists were imprisoned there. In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the [[desegregation]] of public facilities. By the end of June 1963, Freedom Riders had been convicted in [[Jackson, Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Riding On |work=Time |date=July 7, 2007 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,872521,00.html?promoid=googlep |accessdate=October 23, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304105758/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,872521,00.html?promoid=googlep |archive-date=March 4, 2008 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many were jailed in Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. Mississippi employed the [[Trusty system (prison)|trusty system]], a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dsl.psu.edu/civilrights/chapter1.html |title=ACLU Parchman Prison |accessdate=November 29, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307222545/http://www.dsl.psu.edu/civilrights/chapter1.html |archivedate=March 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 the civil rights lawyer [[Roy Haber]] began taking statements from inmates. He collected 50 pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a [[landmark case]] known as ''[[Gates v. Collier]]'' (1972), four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the [[United States Constitution]].

Federal Judge [[William C. Keady]] found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting [[cruel and unusual punishment]]. He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished, as was the trusty system, which allowed certain inmates to have power and control over others.&lt;ref name="hnet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=22500870194459 |title=Parchman Farm and the Ordeal of Jim Crow Justice |accessdate=August 28, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826214105/http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=22500870194459 |archivedate=August 26, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady, who wrote that the prison was an affront to "modern standards of decency." Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation. The system of trusties was abolished. (The prison had armed [[Life imprisonment|lifers]] with rifles and given them authority to oversee and guard other inmates, which led to many abuses and murders.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goldman |first=Robert M.

In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate number of the prisoners, in excess of their proportion of the general population. They were often treated as second-class citizens by white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionately high number of [[death row]] inmates. [[Eldridge Cleaver]]'s book ''[[Soul on Ice (book)|Soul on Ice]]'' was written from his experiences in the California correctional system; it contributed to black militancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cleaver |first=Eldridge |title=Soul on Ice |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1967 |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Cold War Civil Rights: Race and the Image of American Democracy'', the historian Mary L. Dudziak wrote that Communists critical of the United States accused the nation for its hypocrisy in portraying itself as the "leader of the free world," when so many of its citizens were subjected to severe racial discrimination and violence; she argued that this was a major factor in moving the government to support civil rights legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Cold-War-Civil-Rights-Twentieth-Century/dp/0691152438 Dudziak, M.L.: ''Cold War Civil Rights: Race and the Image of American Democracy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2406">'''Cognitive strategies''' are the specific methods that people use to [[Problem solving|solve problems]], including all sorts of reasoning, planning, arithmetic, etc. Importantly, a cognitive strategy need not be all "in the head", but will almost always interact with various aspects of what might be called the "execution context".

==Examples==

A commonly used and elegant example of cognitive strategies comes from small-number addition.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R. (1990) The adaptive character of thought. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous different ways (i.e., different strategies) by which one can get the sum of two (let's say) one digit numbers, for example 3+4 (=7). The way that most adults would solve this problem is by simply remembering the answer (a "memory" strategy), but a toddler would probably use one of a number of different finger-counting strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Siegler, R.S., &amp; Shipley, C. (1995). Variation, selection, and cognitive change. In T. Simon &amp; G. Halford (Eds.), Developing cognitive competence: New approaches to process modeling (pp. 31–76). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one can represent the first addend (3) on one's left hand by raising three fingers, and then do the same with four fingers on the right hand, and then count up the number of fingers that are raised. But there are many other ways to do this. For example, one can do the same first step (raise three fingers on one's left hand), and then start counting from 4 as one raises four more fingers one at a time on either the right hand, or even starting from the fourth finger on the left hand (which would require continuing from 6 on the right hand). Different strategies may have very different characteristics in terms of their time and space complexity, memory requirements, etc., and therefore in terms of their error characteristics.

She was also an organizer with the [[Birmingham campaign]], as well as throughout Mississippi. Her work has included activism in the fields of [[women's rights]] and [[Labor rights|workers' rights]], as well as activism and advocacy for homeless people and youth. She worked with the [[Cynthia McKinney]] for President campaign with "Power to the People". Clark is a member of the Reconstruction Party (USA), and is a chair of Grandmothers for the Release of [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]].

==Civil Rights==
Clark was a student at [[Tougaloo College]], an [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black college]] in [[Tougaloo, Mississippi]] when she became involved with the Civil Rights Movement. An activist with the [[NAACP]], she was involved with voter registration efforts.&lt;ref name="CRDL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crdl.usg.edu/people/c/clark_colia_liddell/?Welcome|title=Clark, Colia Liddell|work=Civil Rights Digital Library|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the guidance of Medgar Evers and John Salter, Clark founded the [[NAACP Youth Council]] in [[North Jackson, Mississippi]].&lt;ref name="Rosche"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themaneater.com/stories/2006/2/7/civil-rights-leader-talk-today/|title=Civil rights leader to talk today|last=Rosche|first=Jedd|date=February 7, 2006|work=[[The Maneater]]|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While working with the NAACP, she became special assistant to [[Medgar Evers]], [[field secretary]] for the [[NAACP]]. In 1962 Clark resigned from the NAACP and joined the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) to do voter registration work alongside her then husband, [[Bernard Lafayette]], in Alabama. This project laid essential groundwork for the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma voting rights campaign]] of 1965. She was eventually named executive secretary of SNCC.&lt;ref name="Rosche"/&gt; She also participated in street demonstrations and experienced police brutality in the [[Birmingham campaign]] of 1963.

In 1964, she helped found the Southern Organizing Committee at Fisk University.&lt;ref name="crmvet.org"&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/vet/colial.htm "Colia Liddell Lafayette Clark" Civil Rights Movement Veterans website]&lt;/ref&gt; She was an organizer in the [[Black Power]] movement, including the [[Republic of New Afrika]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3758873/The_Malcolm_X_Doctrine_The_Republic_of_New_Afrika_and_National_Liberation_on_U.S._Soil Dan Berger "The Malcolm X Doctrine: The Republic of New Afrika and National Liberation on U.S. Soil" in ''New World Coming: The Sixties and the Shaping of Global Consciousness'']&lt;/ref&gt; By early 1973, she returned to Mississippi and worked on a number of other projects including the editorship of the ''[[Jackson Advocate]]''.&lt;ref name="crmvet.org"/&gt;

Clark has been critical of the way in which the Civil Rights Movement has been portrayed in popular media, particularly in the film ''[[Selma film|Selma]]'', arguing it belittles student activism and does nothing to address the legacy of inequality. She is a vocal supporter of the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement, seeing it (along with the Black Power movement) as a successor to the Civil Rights Movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialistorganizer.org/interview-with-colia-lafayette-clark-we-have-to-finish-the-march-of-the-civil-rights-movement/ Anthony Palmer "Interview with Colia LaFayette Clark: We Have to Finish the March of the Civil Rights Movement!”  Socialist Organizer, March 3, 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402111604/http://socialistorganizer.org/interview-with-colia-lafayette-clark-we-have-to-finish-the-march-of-the-civil-rights-movement/ |date=April 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Green Party==
She was co-chair of the New York delegation to the Green Party of the United States presidential nominating convention, where Cynthia McKinney was nominated as the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] Presidential candidate. Clark is currently working on writing, activism and advocacy about Haiti.

==Education==
Clark attended [[Tougaloo College]] and earned a M.A. from [[Albany State University]] in [[Albany, GA]], where she later worked as a professor.&lt;ref name="Rosche"/&gt;

==History==
The concept of Digital Business Ecosystem was put forward in 2002 by a group of European researchers and practitioners, including Francesco Nachira, Paolo Dini and Andrea Nicolai, who applied the general notion of digital ecosystems to model the process of adoption and development of ICT-based products and services in competitive, highly fragmented markets like the European one&lt;ref&gt;F Nachira, P Dini, A Nicolai.

==Perspectives==
The digital ecosystem metaphor and models have been applied to a number of business areas related to the production and distribution of knowledge-intensive products and services, including higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Damiani E., Uden, L, &amp; Trisnawaty W. [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4233689/ The future of E-learning: E-learning ecosystem.] Inaugural IEEE Digital Ecosystems and Technologies Conference (IEEE DEST), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The perspective of this research is providing methods and tools to achieve a set of objectives of the ecosystem (e.g. sustainability, fairness, bounded information asymmetry, risk control and gracious failure). These objectives are seen as desirable properties whose emergence should be fostered by the digital ecosystem self-organization, rather than as explicit design goals like in conventional IT.

{{Too abstract|date=February 2015}}
'''Dionysian imitatio''' is the influential [[literary method]] of imitation as formulated by Greek author [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] in the first century BCE, which conceived it as the [[rhetoric]]al practice of emulating, adapting, reworking and enriching a source text by an earlier author.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="West79p5-8"/&gt; It is a departure from the concept of [[mimesis]] which only is concerned with "imitation of nature" instead of the "imitation of other authors."&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt;

==History==
Three centuries after Aristotle's ''Poetics'', from the 4th century BCE to the 1st century BCE, the meaning of ''mimesis'' as a [[literary method]] had shifted from "imitation of nature" to "imitation of other authors".&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; No historical record is left to explain the reason of this change. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]]' three volume work ''On mimesis'' (''On imitation''), which was the most influential for Latin authors, is lost.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; Most of it contained advice on how to identify the most suitable writers to imitate and the best way to imitate them.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"&gt;Ruthven (1979) pp. 103–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="West79p5-8"/&gt; For Dionysian ''imitatio'', the object of imitation was not a single author but the qualities of many.&lt;ref name="West79p5-8"&gt;West (1979) pp.5–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' ''imitatio'' and discarded Aristotle's ''mimesis''; the imitation literary approach is closely linked with the widespread observation that "everything has been said already", which was also stated by Egyptian scribes around 2000 BCE. The ideal aim of this approach to literature was not [[originality]], but to surpass the predecessor by improving their writings and set the bar to a higher level.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; A prominent Latin follower of Dionysius was [[Quintilian]], who shared with him the view of ''imitatio'' as the practice that leads to an [[History of ideas|historical progress]] of literature over time.&lt;ref name="West79p5-8"/&gt; Both Dionysius and Quintilian discuss ''imitation'' exclusively from the point of view of rhetoric.&lt;ref name="West79p5-8"/&gt; In Quintilian, and in [[classical rhetoric]] in general, rhetoric drew much attention to the process of imitatio; the [[four operations of quadripartita ratio]] that organize all the [[figures of speech]], defined as a "ready-made framework" of "relatively mechanical procedures" for the emulation, adaptation, reworking and enrichment of a source text by an earlier author.&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen (2008), quote from the summary: {{quotation|The variety of ways to adapt and enrich source texts, as discussed by Erasmus in De Copia Rerum, are discussed in chapter 5. [...] Classical rhetoric had already developed a theory of these kinds of intervention, drawing attention to the process of adaptation [...] If a topic had been treated by an earlier author, this was no reason to avoid it, but one had to try to emulate one's predecessor. The use of rhetoric enabled authors to discuss the same topic in several ways, to be little a great subject, and to accord greatness to something small, for example, or to renew the old, and express the new in an old-fashioned manner. [...] Using these formulas, a pupil could render the same subject or theme in a myriad of ways. For the mature author, this principle offered a set of tools to rework source texts into a new creation. In short, the quadripartita ratio offered the student or author a ready-made framework, whether for changing words or the transformation of entire texts. Since it concerned relatively mechanical procedures of adaptation that for the most part could be learned, the techniques concerned could be taught at school at a relatively early age, for example in the improvement of pupils’ own writing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view of rhetoric was taken by [[Erasmus]] in ''[[De Copia Rerum]]''.&lt;ref name="Jansen"/&gt;

== Mimesis ==
Dionysius' concept marked a significant depart from the concept of ''[[mimesis]]'' formulated by [[Aristotle]] in the 4th century BCE, which was only concerned with "imitation of nature" instead of the "imitation of other authors."&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' ''imitatio'' and discarded Aristotle's ''mimesis''.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; In [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[lyric poetry]], [[epic poetry]], drama, dancing, painting are all described as forms of [[mimesis]].

[[File:EPA Safer Choice industrial logo.svg|thumb|right]]
The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]’s (EPA’s) Safer Choice label, previously known as the [[Design for the Environment |Design for the Environment (DfE)]] label, helps consumers and commercial buyers identify and select products with safer chemical ingredients, without sacrificing quality or performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.edf.org/blog/2016/04/04/epa-label-ids-safer-choice-cleaning-products |title=This EPA label IDs "Safer Choice" cleaning products |last=McPartland |first=Jennifer |date=2016-04-04 |publisher=Environmental Defense Fund |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a product has the Safer Choice label, it means that every intentionally-added ingredient in the product has been evaluated by EPA scientists. Only the safest possible functional ingredients are allowed in products with the Safer Choice label.

Safer Choice is a voluntary partnership program that is grounded in more than 40 years of EPA experience in evaluating the human health and environmental characteristics of chemicals. As of January 2015, more than 2,000 products qualify to carry the Safer Choice label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/frequently-asked-questions-safer-choice |title=Frequently Asked Questions on Safer Choice |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-11-21 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Businesses can apply to become partners by submitting their products to the Safer Choice program for review.

== Introduction ==
Since the mid-2000s, EPA's label for safer chemical products has been known as the Design for the Environment, or the DfE label.&lt;ref name="EPA-history"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/history-safer-choice-and-design-environment |title=History of Safer Choice and Design for the Environment |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-04-19 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending more than a year collecting ideas and discussing new label options with stakeholders, such as product manufacturers and environmental and health advocates, the EPA took its ideas to consumers and asked what worked best. The result is the new Safer Choice label.

Products that carry the Safer Choice label must meet requirements for:
* Safer chemical ingredients
* Product performance
* Packaging sustainability
* Ingredient disclosure 
* Surveillance and audits 
* Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) emissions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Learn About the Safer Choice Label |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/learn-about-safer-choice-label |date=2017-04-06 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
EPA’s Safer Choice Program is a renaming of the Design for the Environment (DfE) Safer Product Labeling Program.  DfE began in the early 1990s as an innovative, voluntary program to help companies consider human health, environmental, and economic effects of chemicals and technologies.&lt;ref name="EPA-history"/&gt; DfE started the Safer Product Labeling Program as a project with the chemical-based products industry (e.g. cleaners and detergents) to help leading companies use safer chemicals to make high-performing products. DfE developed this certification program based on its Standard for Safer Products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Safer Choice Standard and Criteria |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/standard |date=2016-12-20 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and safer chemical criteria, allowing companies to differentiate their products in the marketplace and making it easier for consumers and business purchasers to identify products that are safer for workers, families, pets, and the environment.

Using its science-based criteria that defines safer chemistry by chemical class, Safer Choice has helped the industry innovate and develop safer chemicals and chemical-based products. A number of companies have designed new chemicals to meet Safer Choice criteria, or invested in research to show that existing chemicals are safer.

In March 2015, the Safer Choice label replaced the DfE product label, marking the transition from the Safer Product Labeling Program to the Safer Choice Program. The new Safer Choice label helps consumers, businesses and institutional buyers easily recognize products that have earned EPA’s Safer Choice certification.

In addition to the Safer Choice label above, Safer Choice offers an optional label that product manufacturers may use on products designated for businesses, office buildings, sports venues and schools. Safer Choice also has a label that indicates that a product is fragrance-free, to help consumers who prefer products without fragrance.

== Meaning of the label ==
When a product carries the Safer Choice label, it means that every intentionally added ingredient—no exceptions, no ''[[de minimis]]''—in the product has been reviewed by EPA scientists. Only products that meet the Safer Choice Standard, which includes stringent human health and environmental criteria, are allowed to carry the label.

Safer Choice evaluates the individual constituents of every proprietary component of a product to ensure that it does not contain chemicals that may present potential health or environmental effects, including ingredients used in small percentages, like fragrances, preservatives, and dyes.

Safer Choice further requires its partners to undergo annual reviews, including on-site audits, to verify product ingredients and ensure compliance with all Safer Choice Program requirements.

== Qualifications to receive the label ==
Companies that enter into partnership with the Safer Choice Program and meet the Safer Choice Standard do so voluntarily. Companies that manufacture Safer Choice products have invested heavily in research and reformulation to ensure that their ingredients and finished products line up on the greener end of the health and environmental spectrum. These companies are leaders in safer products and sustainability.

== Types of products Safer Choice labels ==
Safer Choice labels a wide range of products for consumer and industry use, including:
* All-purpose cleaners
* Athletic field paints
* Bathroom cleaners
* Car cleaners
* Carpet cleaners
* Degreasers
* Dish detergents and hand soaps
* Floor care products
* Glass cleaners
* Laundry products
* Metal cleaners
* Pet care products
* Septic treatment products
* Wood cleaners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cleaning with care—a safe ingredient for tough dirt |url=http://www.eastman.com/Brands/Eastman_Omnia/Pages/Safety.aspx |publisher=Eastman |location=Kingsport, TN |access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fragrances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Leamy |first=Elisabeth |date=2018-03-20 |title=Bothered by fragrances? This story will be a breath of fresh air. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/bothered-by-fragrances-this-story-will-be-a-breath-of-fresh-air/2018/03/19/ace83e8a-26cd-11e8-b79d-f3d931db7f68_story.html?noredirect=on |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safer Chemical Ingredients List ==
The Safer Chemical Ingredients List (SCIL) is a list of chemical ingredients that the Safer Choice Program has evaluated and determined to be safer than traditional chemical ingredients used for the same function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Safer Chemical Ingredients List |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/safer-ingredients |date=2018-02-06 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list is arranged by functional-use class and is designed to help manufacturers find safer chemical alternatives that meet the criteria of the Safer Choice Program. Safer Choice ensures that no confidential or trade secret information appears in the list.

The Safer Choice Standard and the Criteria for Safer Chemical Ingredients are protective and address a broad range of potential toxicological effects (e.g., carcinogenicity, chronic toxicity and aquatic toxicity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criteria for Safer Chemical Ingredients |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/standard#tab-2 |date=2016-12-20 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; All chemicals in the listing are among the safest for their functional use.

== Safer Choice Partner of the Year Awards ==
In 2015, the Safer Choice Program launched its Partner of the Year Awards to recognize program participants who have demonstrated leadership in furthering safer chemistry and products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Safer Choice Partner of the Year Awards |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/safer-choice-partner-year-awards |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''economics of plastics processing''' is determined by the type of process. [[Plastics]] can be processed with the following methods: machining, [[compression molding]], [[transfer molding]], [[injection molding]], [[extrusion]], [[rotational molding]], [[blow molding]], [[thermoforming]], casting, forging, and [[foam molding]]. Processing methods are selected based on equipment cost, production rate, tooling cost, and build volume. High equipment and tooling cost methods are typically used for large production volumes whereas low - medium equipment cost and tooling cost methods are used for low production volumes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Manufacturing Processes for Engineering Materials (5th ed)|last = Kalpakjian|first = Serope|publisher = Pearson Education, Inc.|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-13-227271-1|location = Upper Saddle River, NJ 07458|pages = 657–658|first2 = Steven|last2 = Schmid}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compression molding, transfer molding, injection molding, forging, and foam [[Molding (process)|molding]] has high equipment and tooling cost.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lower cost processes are machining, extruding, rotational molding, blow molding, thermoforming, and casting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A summary of each process and its cost is displayed figure 1.

==Aspects of plastic processing==

=== Degradable plastics ===
[[Oxo-degradable]] plastics:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Oxodegradable plastics: degradation, environmental impact and recycling|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270465953|journal = Proceedings of the ICE - Waste and Resource Management|pages = 133–140|volume = 165|issue = 3|doi = 10.1680/warm.11.00014|first = Noreen L.|last = Thomas|first2 = Andrew R.|last2 = McLauchlin|first3 = Stuart G.|last3 = Patrick|first4 = Jane|last4 = Clarke|year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; these are petroleum-based plastics with additives such as transition metals and metals salts that promote the process of fragmentation of the plastic when exposed to a particular environment, such as high temperature or oxygen rich one, for a prolonged period of time. Fragmentation exposes a larger surface area of the plastic to colonies of bacteria that eventually decompose the polymer into its lower energy state components: carbon dioxide and water.

Some aspects to take into account regarding this method to dispose of end-of-life plastics are:
* The type of polymer: experiments conducted by Chiellini ''et al.'' confirmed that bacteria are only able to decompose low molecular weight polymers (at least at a rate that can be appreciated).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Comparative Study of the Degradability and Recyclability of Different Classes of Degradable Polyethylene|journal = Journal of Macromolecular Science, Part A|date = 1995-04-01|issn = 1060-1325|pages = 709–730|volume = 32|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/10601329508010283|first = S.|last = Al-Malaika|first2 = S.|last2 = Chohan|first3 = M.|last3 = Coker|first4 = G.|last4 = Scott|first5 = R.|last5 = Arnaud|first6 = P.|last6 = Dabin|first7 = A.|last7 = Fauve|first8 = J.|last8 = Lemaire}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Environmental conditions: the time for fragmentation/degradation varies according to conditions which aren’t always controllable. 
* Material’s potential to be recycled: this characteristic will be compromised, since the polymer’s durability or strength will be affected by the additives that accelerate fragmentation.
Classifying a polymer as [[biodegradation|bio-degradable]] requires specifications regarding these aspects.

Important economic aspects that need to be considered when disposing of degradable polymers include:
* Waste landfill costs:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Plastics recycling: challenges and opportunities|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date = 2009-07-27|issn = 0962-8436|pmc = 2873020|pmid = 19528059|pages = 2115–2126|volume = 364|issue = 1526|doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0311|first = Jefferson|last = Hopewell|first2 = Robert|last2 = Dvorak|first3 = Edward|last3 = Kosior}}&lt;/ref&gt; if plastics represent a significant percentage of waste in a particular region, manufacturing plastics with bio-degradable properties may be more profitable and ecologically friendly than merely disposing of a non-degradable plastic.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.jclepro.2004.02.018|title = Municipal solid waste management from a systems perspective|journal = Journal of Cleaner Production|volume = 13|issue = 3|pages = 241–252|year = 2005|last1 = Eriksson|first1 = O.|last2 = Carlsson Reich|first2 = M.|last3 = Frostell|first3 = B.|last4 = Björklund|first4 = A.|last5 = Assefa|first5 = G.|last6 = Sundqvist|first6 = J.-O.|last7 = Granath|first7 = J.|last8 = Baky|first8 = A.|last9 = Thyselius|first9 = L.|url = http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-8913}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using degradable polymers, costs due to waste transportation, landfill maintenance, new landfill excavation and environmental hazard control can be avoided. 
* Lost end-of-life plastic potential:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; processes such as [[energy recovery]] of the plastic by incineration or biological treatment and material recovery by recycling have to be taken into account when assessing the feasibility of manufacturing degradable polymers.

=== Reusable plastic containers ===

The implementation of [[Reuse|reusable]] [[plastic container]]s arises as a consequence of concerns with sustainability and [[environmental impact]]. Use of recyclable plastic packages is beneficial environmentally but is more expensive.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.ijpe.2013.12.014|title = Economic and environmental assessment of reusable plastic containers: A food catering supply chain case study| journal=International Journal of Production Economics| volume=152| pages=88–101|year = 2014|last1 = Accorsi|first1 = Riccardo| last2=Cascini| first2=Alessandro| last3=Cholette| first3=Susan| last4=Manzini| first4=Riccardo| last5=Mora| first5=Cristina}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of reusable plastic containers will amount to an approximate annual increase of 0.058 euros/kg of delivered goods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The cost associated with reusable plastic containers are packaging purchasing costs, transportation costs, labor/handling costs, management costs, and costs resulting from losses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Packaging purchasing costs encompasses the cost of the containers as well as any associated service costs. This cost is reoccurring but is only relevant once every 50 cycles, which is the typical lifetime of reusable plastic containers. One cycle consists of the initial stages of processing plastic containers all the way to the use and recycling of these containers by the consumers. Transportation costs are slightly higher for reusable plastic containers as compared to traditional use and throwaway plastic containers in that these reusable containers need additional transportation to recycling facilities. Reusable plastic containers also require work loading and unloading from trucks as well as quality inspection, this adds additional labor costs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Management costs exists because reusable plastic container stock count needs to be managed. The final cost of reusable plastic containers is the cost incurred when packages are lost or there are errors within the management system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Figure 2 provides a detailed summary of the costs associated with adopting reusable plastic containers.

===Incineration of plastics===

[[plastics recycling|Recycling plastics]] presents the difficulty of handling mixed plastics, as unmixed plastics are usually necessary to maintain desirable properties. Mixing many plastics results in diminished material properties, with even just a few percent of [[polypropylene]] mixed with [[polyethylene]] producing a plastic with significantly reduced [[tensile strength]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Stein|first = Richard S.|year = 1998|title = Polymer Recycling: Thermodynamics and Economics|url =|journal = Macromolecular Symposia}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative to recycling of these plastics and those which can’t be easily recycled such as thermosets is to use degradation to break the polymers down into monomers of low molecular weight. The products of this process can be used to make high quality polymers however energy stored in the polymer bonds is lost during this process.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

An alternative to economically dispose of plastics is to burn them in an [[incinerator]]. Incinerators capable of cleanly burning polymers exist and while they require significant capital investment, the energy produced offsets the economic impact.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|date = 26 September 1989|title = The Environmental Impact of Municipal Solid Waste Incineration|url =|journal = Findings of the International Symposium on Solid Waste Incineration, Symposium: Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since most plastics are produced from [[petroleum]], their molecules consist exclusively or primarily of [[carbon]], oxygen, and hydrogen atoms. With proper design, an incinerator can completely combust these plastics allowing the recovery of energy stored in the original petroleum feedstock which would otherwise escape during processes such as degradation. Some polymers contain [[chlorine]] or [[nitrogen]] which can result in undesirable combustion products however the use of [[scrubber]]s can remove such products. The end result is that many polymers burn more cleanly than [[coal]] and as clean as most oils.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Feminist children's literature''' is the writing of [[children's literature]] through a feminist lens. Children's literature and [[women's literature]] have many similarities. Both often deal with being weak and placed towards the bottom of a hierarchy. In this way feminist ideas are regularly found in the structure of children's literature. Feminist criticism of children's literature is therefore expected, since it is a type of [[feminist literature]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nodelman|first1=Perry|title=Children's Literature as Women's Writing|journal=Children's Literature Association Quarterly|date=1988|volume=13.1|doi=10.1353/chq.0.0264|pages=31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist children's literature has played a critical role for the [[feminist movement]], especially in the past half century. In her book ''Feminism Is for Everybody: Passionate Politics'', [[bell hooks]]&lt;!-- Lower-case is correct.--&gt; states her belief that all types of media, including writing and children's books, need to promote feminist ideals. She argues "Children's literature is one of the most crucial sites for feminist education for critical consciousness precisely because beliefs and identities are still being formed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hooks|first1=Bell|title=Feminism Is for Everybody: Passionate Politics|date=2000|publisher=South End|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover of hooks' book, drawn by Laura DeSantis, depicts children alongside adults, showing the importance of the youth. The presence of feminism in children's literature has evolved over the years, but the overall message and goals have remained consistent.

==Background==

===Overview===
During the second half of the twentieth century, children's literature and the feminist movement made many improvements together. A currently accepted method of thought for children's literature criticism in the academic world came to life during the 1970s, the same time that the second wave of [[feminist theory]] became popular. Early in the decade, feminist critics like [[Kate Millett]] explained how good writing was based on a belief that being a white male was normal and anyone else was a deviation from the normal.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} At this time, many female characters in children's books "play dead or doormats (as in 'Snow White', 'Cinderella', and 'Sleeping Beauty') or are severely mutilated (as in 'The Little Mermaid')".{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Due to the second wave of feminism, [[gender roles]] in all of the classic fairy tales (such as those by Grimm, Andersen, and Perrault) were starting to be questioned. Female heroes of the time were also inadequate. The women were simply "men tricked out in drag" and had the same exact plotlines as the male heroes. The only difference was that instead of needing to be rescued, the heroines did the rescuing.&lt;ref name="Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd / Books"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paul|first1=Lissa|title=Understanding Children's Literature|date=1998|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd / Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; More and more studies began emerging from children's literature. All the findings agreed that women were drastically underrepresented and given few options. Boys were overwhelmingly shown to be much more active and have adventures more frequently, while girls were passive and remained in the home with the adult women. Countless studies conducted over the years all had the same or similar results.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wigutoff|first1=Sharon|title=The Feminist Press: Ten Years of Nonsexist Children's Books.|journal=The Lion and the Unicorn|date=1979|volume=3.2|doi=10.1353/uni.0.0382|pages=57–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics and studies===
A study conducted in 1976 by the [[Feminist Press]] examined [[picture book]]s for children between the ages of four and eight published from 1972. Books were chosen if they contained the following themes: an active and adventurous girl protagonist, boys expressing multiple emotions and being sensitive, and non-traditional families that reflect multiple aspects of society. The picture books were then examined for [[gender stereotypes]] in primary and secondary characterizations, illustrations, and language. The results showed many instances of sexism. Out of a few thousand picture books published in the five-year span, fewer than 200 met the qualities needed. Although 35 publishers were represented by the books, only about six publishing houses made up the majority. Furthermore, most of the stories only had the first quality, which was a girl as an active protagonist. However, there was a problem in these stories as well. While the young main character could go out on adventures, the mother and grandmother characters were stuck in traditional roles. The study found limited examples of books that showed men as nurturing or of characters in non-traditional families. Only 143 books in the study were decided to be recommendable, 28 were somewhat recommendable, and 22 were not recommendable at all.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

In 1989 a study was done in which the number of female and male characters in children's books was measured. It found that books from 1972 had female characters only 25% of the time, while in 1989 female characters were shown just as frequently as male characters. It also discovered that [[Caldecott]] winners and honor books were becoming more likely to have female characters, and that they were not given stereotyped roles as they were in the 1960s. In the late 1960s, only 1% of animal illustrations in Caldecott books were females. However, by the late 80s that number increased to 22%, and by the late 90s it was at about 72%.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Roger|title=Why All The Counting? Feminist Social Science Research On Children's Literature.|journal=Children's Literature in Education|date=2002|volume=33.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three studies done in the late 1970s and early 80s yielded interesting results about what children like to have in their books. In 1975 [[Sally Jennings]] completed a study that found that kids around the age of four remember stories where characters do reversed-stereotyped things more than they remember stories where characters act according to classic gender roles. In 1978, a study by [[Sally Koblinksky]] found that by the age of 10 children better remember stories with stereotyped characters. A study done by [[Jerri Kropp]] and [[Charles Halverston]] in 1983 showed that children in preschool dislike hearing stories in which characters of the opposite gender act along gender stereotypes more than they dislike stories that have characters that do reverse-stereotyped things.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

In the early 1990s several studies were carried out that showed an increase in equality in award-winning children's literature. The research found that only 11.1% of Caldecotts during 1967 to 1971 had female protagonist. During the years 1987 to 1991, however, 43.2% had main characters that were female. By the start of the twenty-first century, reverse-stereotyped roles in the protagonist were as popular as stereotyped roles during the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

By 1992 only 32% of [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prizes for fiction writing]], and a mere 8% of [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prizes in literature]], were awarded to women. However, women had won 66% of [[Newbery Medal]]s. The number of female authors producing children's literature was a strong factor in these  statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Beverly|title=Fair Godmothers or Wicked Stepmothers?: The Uneasy Relationship of Feminist Theory and Children's Criticism|journal=Children's Literature Association Quarterly|date=1993|volume=18.4|doi=10.1353/chq.0.0910|pages=171–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals of feminist children's literature==
While it is important for females and males to be depicted equally in children's books, that is not the main purpose of feminist children's literature. Children's books often focus on people or animals who do not have power because they are placed at the bottom of a hierarchy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Therefore, it is the goal of feminists to promote children's literature that gives children autonomy and the authority to speak and be heard. Books for children need to show how important it is to be able to listen and hear the accounts of others' stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Louise|title=Autonomy And Authorship: Storytelling In Children's Picture Books|journal=Hypatia|date=2010|volume=25.1|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.2010.01090.x|pages=174–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, feminist theory gives children the right to be included in the literary community, to no longer be oppressed by a hierarchical order of power.&lt;ref name="Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd / Books"/&gt; A final goal of feminists is to create non-sexist books that show what society is becoming. Promoting feminist theory without being labeled as a "message book" is crucial to the cause.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; By focusing on these goals, feminist authors hope to get their message across while still producing quality books for children.

==Another perspective==
Beginning in the 1960s, feminism began to appear in many forms of media because of the social changes taking place at the time. Feminists began to use children's books to spread a better understanding of feminism and the stereotypes of women. As children are a main target of the influential stereotypes of patriarchal mass media and important receptors of literature, they can be influenced by feminist literature to help abandon any learned stereotypes. Since [[second-wave feminism]], children's literature has been influenced by feminist theory and ideals, and is still growing as an influential media source in literature in today's society.

In ''Feminism is for Everybody'', [[bell hooks]] expresses her enthusiasm for spreading feminist ideals to everyone to prevent stereotypes and give people new perspectives on feminism. She argues that feminism needs to be shared through many sources of media so that its ideals are easily accessible to everyone. Feminist theory can be found in children's literature. Hooks states, "There should be so many little feminist primers, easy to read pamphlets and books, telling us all about feminism, that this book would be just another passionate voice speaking out on behalf of feminist politics".&lt;ref name="hooks"&gt;{{cite book|last1=hooks|first1=bell|title=Feminism is for Everybody|date=2000|publisher=South End Press|location=Cambridge|pages=vii, x|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist children's literature provides one form of this easy-to-read media. It either acts to highlight women and educate people about their history, or it subtly shares ideas of reversed gender roles where a female character might have more power.

Children's literature can be a valuable media source to influence children's views as they learn gender stereotypes and stereotypes about women in society. Feminism began to have an increasing presence in children's literature after second-wave feminism. According to [[Kinga Varga-Dobai]], second-wave feminist research had a huge impact on media such as children's literature.&lt;ref name="Varga-Dobai"&gt;Kinga Varga-Dobai&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Varga-Dobai|first1=Kinga|title=Gender Issues in Multicultural Children's Literature--Black and Third World Feminist Critiques of Appropriation, Essentialism, and Us/Other Binary Oppositions|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=13&amp;sid=8ff93d98-4948-416d-b159-0ce30bcd26c0%40sessionmgr4005&amp;hid=4114&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&amp;AN=89660114|website=Multicultural Perspectives|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article by [[Abigail Feely]] states, "Children's books published during and after the second-wave feminists movement provide unique clues into the gradual normalization of feminist rhetoric into broader cultural context".&lt;ref name=Feely&gt;Abigail Feely&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feely|first1=Abigail|title=Picturing an Alternate Ending: Teaching Feminism and Social Change with The Paper Bag Princess|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=3edab4bd-e644-4654-857d-f3cc0ef5fdcb%40sessionmgr114&amp;hid=102&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&amp;AN=90007797|website=Ebscohost|publisher=The History Teacher|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varga-Dobai also states that the 1960s brought about the ideas of multicultural literature because of "shifting social and political perspectives on race, class, and gender." People began to pay more attention to the degree that children were being influenced by any ideologies embedded in children's books. Many feminists noticed that traditional folktales contained female characteristics that feminists did not agree with. Varga-Dobai says that female characters in children's novels began to be portrayed as more daring, active, and independent, in order to provide girls with a new image of an ideal female.&lt;ref name="Varga-Dobai"/&gt;

The idea of a strong, independent female character in children's books plays into the topic of gender representation. According to Varga-Dobai, "The study of gender portrayals in children's literature has been closely informed by both cultural and feminist studies because women, as members of culture, have often been represented as the "other" in literature".&lt;ref name="Varga-Dobai"/&gt; Therefore, feminists work to overcome any misrepresentations or stereotypes of gender in children's literature. Feminists want children to be educated through a feminist view so that their opinions are not as skewed when it comes to gender stereotypes and education of influential women. Also according to Varga-Dobai, "From a postconstructural feminist perspective, gender representations should allow for a more complex portrayal of subject positions available for female characters".&lt;ref name="Varga-Dobai"/&gt; As second-wave feminism brought social change in women's positions in society, female characters also began to take on a social change, moving away from the traditional female characters.

One example of a children's book that includes feminist ideals that highlight females is ''Rad American Women A-Z'' by [[Kate Shatz]]. Inspired by her two-year-old daughter, Schatz wanted to create a book that educates children on women's history and also teaches them the alphabet. She noticed the gap in feminist-inspired children's literature. The book features inspirational women of different races whose names start with each letter of the alphabet. It highlights influential women, or "feminist heroes," who have made important accomplishments but may not be well known. This book not only intends to fill a hole in feminist literature for children, but also to address and represent race through the women that Schatz includes. This book begins to fulfill the need of "easy to read pamphlets and books" that hooks&lt;!-- Lower-case is correct.--&gt; discusses.&lt;ref name="Feinstein"&gt;Laura Feinstein&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feinstein|first1=Laura|title=Feminist Heroes to Teach Kids Their ABCs in Badass New Picturebook|url=http://magazine.good.is/articles/illustrated-feminist-heroes-to-teach-children-their-abcs|website=GOOD: A Magazine for the Global Citizen|publisher=GOOD Worldwide Inc|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent example of a feminist children's story that subtly speaks out about the issues of gender stereotypes is ''[[The Paper Bag Princess]]'' by [[Robert Munsch]]. Some{{who|date=September 2018}} consider this story to be the birth of feminist literature.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} It is a fairytale that has a strong female character and a feminist ending rather than a traditional story ending. The princess wears a paper bag and puts herself in danger to rescue the prince. However, the prince is ungrateful because she does not look like a real princess in her paper bag. Like many children's books, this story shows reversed roles of male and female characters, which reveals that feminist ideals are seeping into children's literature.

Children's literature can have a significant impact in the classroom. As children learn about issues of culture, feminist lenses are encouraging students to take on different perspectives. Learning through a feminist lens also encourages different views not only about gender representations, but also about race and class. It is believed that feminist theory can transform students' readings by how much they recognize the different gender patterns throughout literature. An article by Feely suggests, "Many radical and incorrect images of feminism persist in the popular imagination. At the same time, ironically, feminism has become so ingrained into mainstream culture that many students don't recognize it".&lt;ref name="Feely"/&gt; Feminism is sometimes skewed in the popular media, but it is also subtly fixed into culture{{clarification needed|date=September 2018}} in different ways such as through children's literature. As students learn, they are heavily influenced by mainstream culture, but incorporating children's literature into classroom settings can help expand opinions.

Feminist children's books are becoming more prevalent, but we are still in need of more female children's authors and books, according to hooks.&lt;!-- Lower-case is correct.--&gt; In hooks' opinion, "We are not there yet. But this is what we must do to share feminism, to let the movement into everybody's mind and heart".&lt;ref name="hooks"/&gt; She believes that there is still much to be done to spread the correct image of feminism, whether it is done through children's literature or through mainstream media sources. Feminism has become more prevalent in children's books since second-wave feminism, but there is still a gap in children's feminist literature that can continue to be filled.

== Ethics ==
Historically children’s books were written to entertain and educate children. However, new readings of children’s books reveal unethical concepts towards racism, gender and colonialism. New gender and feminist studies endeavour to right these wrongs. The goal is to unlearn previous negative attitudes of race and gender. Children’s learning is to be moulded in diversity and inclusivity is a moral principle and mutual obligation by parents, educators and the community. The ethics in children’s books guide the young reader to form basic concepts and fundamental principles of decent human conduct and essential equality. Ethics help children to shape the way they live, what they do, and how they make choices and values in their world.  
Since the mid -50s it has become vogue to reread and reinterpret classic children’s books. As to what children’s books should accomplish trouble cultural observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singer|first=Amy E.|date=2011|title="A Novel Approach: the Sociology of Literature, Children's Books, and Inequality."|url=|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Methods|volume=|pages=308|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they agree that the narratives in children’s books must delete unequal social arrangements: and instead of identifying inequality, describe, challenge, and subvert systems of inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singer|first=Amy E.|date=2011|title=“A Novel Approach: The Sociology of Literature, Children’s Books, and Inequality.”|url=|journal=International Journal of Qualitive Methods|volume=|pages=307|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generalizations ==
Gender stereotypes found in innocent characters in fairy tales and racism and sexism found in the simplistic adventures of Thomas the Tank Engine do not give children positive role models.

The message in the Little Red Hen, teamwork and hard work, is overlooked and its main character has become a racist capitalist who refused to feed the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whaleoil.co.nz/2017/10/new-regressive-sport-finding-racism-childrens-books/|title=The New Regressive Sport of Finding Racism and Sexism in Children’s Books.|last=|first=|date=|website=SB|archive-url=|archive-date=1 October 2017|dead-url=|access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Pan saves Tiger Lilly, and his heroic gesture is indicative of her as uneducated and savage because she is a female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tor.com/2015/06/25/using-tinker-bell-to-shake-magic-into-everything-disney-peter-pan/|title=Using Tinker Bell to Shake Magic into Everything: Disney’s Peter Pan.|last=Ness|first=Mari|date=25 June 2015|website=Tor|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A picture book Rosie’s Walk, written by Pat Hutchinson, about a hen who is unaware that a fox is hunting her in the farmyard is seen as a symbol of ‘stupid womanhood.’ However, critics overlook the humours musings of Rosie’s walk around the farmyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Towenshend|first=John Rowe|date=1976|title="Racism and Sexism in Children's Books"|url=|journal=community|volume=5|pages=157-160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics in America suggest a rewriting of Cinderella in a ‘less sexist vein.’ Cinderella is too pretty; she has dishpan hands and flat feet because she does too much housework and Cinderella dances with too many men in one night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Townshend|first=John Rowe|date=1976|title=“Racism and Sexism in Children’s Books,”|url=|journal=New Community 5|volume=5|pages=157-160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Famous Five, critics accuse Enid Blyton’s depiction of boys and girls as sexist. It is not enough for Georgina to be a leader if she looks like a girl. The character has to take on the persona of a boy by having short hair and demanding to be called George.

The independent, self-assertive, supergirl, Pippi Longstocking is but a boy in disguise.

These generalizations are counter-productive and divert from the more overtly severe cases, such as Little Black Sambo (1899). However, the author, Helen Bannerman had no obnoxious intentions; by default, she did not have a talent for drawing. Polar, written by Elaine Moss, about a polar bear, was rejected by an American publisher because the bear is ‘explicitly white.’

In an attempt to avoid stereotypes, girls are shown as strong, brave and resourceful, mothers go out to work, boys knit, and fathers cook cakes. Authors write, and editors publish in fear in absurd efforts to avoid giving offence. Another implication of these attitudes is a reverse gender stratification: girls cannot wear pink as it sets a gender norm of the feminine and boys must not wear blue as it sets a gender norm of masculine traits. However, because the unrealistic generalizations of gender representation in the debate on rewriting classic books, stripping them of all negative gender, sexism and racial bias continues.  Sarah Begley, Time (2017), advises parents to read with their children, ‘children are going to encounter it, and a safer way to learn how to counter it is via fiction. If you are reading a sexist/racist children’s book with a child, you can help them read it critically.’ Another critic, Malcolm Jones, cites from the National Coalition Against Censorship, PEN American Center, and the First Amendment Committee of American Society of Journalists and Authors who argued ‘while it is perfectly valid for critics to dispute a book’s historical accuracy and literary merits, the appropriate response is not to withdraw the volume and deprive readers of a chance to evaluate the book and the controversy for themselves.’

Amy Singer suggests children are deprived of great literature, exciting stories, mystery, and adventure in the rewriting of classical children’s books. Furthermore, these books are useful as historical evidence of how and what shaped people’s attitude in the time they were written and supply a source of debate of right and wrong and how we acknowledge that there is a better way to live. Moreover, studies by sociologists focus on the behaviour of boys and girls in books as an ideological reality of individual ability and character. In''Novel Readings''(1990) Marjorie DeVault suggests, ‘readers of a single novel create an individual understanding of that novel, alongside the meanings that the novel’s creator might have intended.’

However, Amy Singer, claims that ‘a subversive story for children will include not only strong role models at an individual level but also connections between social power and inequality.’ The questions Singer asks are how connected are the narratives of the protagonists to the social structures in which they live and do they implicate a subversive representation of the cultural stratification. The questionnaire that Singer developed in her analysis of children’s books takes into consideration the:

Book publication date, publisher, author and the elements of narrative texts. What is the books setting, who is the primary character, is there an implied reader and what is her/his implied body of knowledge?

Moreover, Ewick and Silbey suggest that children’s narratives can ‘support challenges to the status quo by illuminating a set of tactics for future use.' Children’s narratives can inspire change and can provide the exposure of power as a means to reverse that power. When children read books, they look for role models with leadership qualities. Due to the lack of female representation, girls are being denied positive role models to emulate. In order to dispel the belief there is only one way to identify as male or female in children’s books, a variety of characters, personality traits and behaviours are paramount in the writing of children’s books.

More important, children’s narratives can teach children how social arrangements are gendered and how they may determine their fates. The role model that characters play out and their narratives can draw attention to social relationships and teach young readers to think critically about what they read. Furthermore, to expose young readers to social systems and inequality will teach them how the world is organised and how they might be negotiated or challenged.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9172">'''Foreclosure''' (also known as "foreclusion"; {{lang-fr|forclusion}}) is the English translation of a term that the French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] introduced into [[psychoanalysis]] to identify a specific psychical cause for [[psychosis]]. &lt;ref&gt;Dylan Evans, ''Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis'' (Routledge 1996) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to Élisabeth Roudinesco, the term was originally introduced into [[psychology]] 'in 1928, when [[Édouard Pichon]] published, in [[Pierre Janet]]'s review, his article on "The Psychological Significance of Negation in French": "...[and] borrowed the legal term ''forclusif'' to indicate facts that the speaker no longer sees as part of reality'.&lt;ref&gt;Roudinesco, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Christophe Laudou, the term was introduced by Damourette and Pichon.&lt;ref&gt;« À propos de Judith Butler. », Mouvements 6/2004 (no 36), p. 158-164, URL : www.cairn.info/revue-mouvements-2004-6-page-158.htm. DOI : 10.3917/mouv.036.0158.&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Freud vs Laforgue===
The publication took part against the background of the Twenties dispute between Freud and [[René Laforgue]] over [[scotomization]]. 'If I am not mistaken', Freud wrote in 1927, 'Laforgue would say in this case that the boy "scotomizes" his perception of the woman's lack of a penis. A new technical term is justified when it describes a new fact or emphasizes it. This is not the case here'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "Fetishism", ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; Freud went on to suggest that if one wanted to 'reserve the word "''[[Psychological repression|Verdrängung]]''" ["repression"] for the affect, then the correct German word for the vicissitude of the idea would be "''[[Disavowal|Verleugnung]]''" ["disavowal"]'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Fetishism", pp. 352–3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacan's introduction of foreclosure==

In 1938 Lacan relates the origin of psychosis to an exclusion of the father from the family structure thereby reducing this structure to a mother-child relationship. &lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, "Les complexes familiaux dans la formation de l'individu", Paris, Navarin 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, when working on the distinctions between the real, imaginary and symbolic father, he specifies that it is the absence of the symbolic father which is linked to psychosis.

Lacan uses the Freudian term, "''Verwerfung''", which the ''Standard Edition'' translates as "repudiation", as a specific defence mechanism different from repression, "''Verdrängung''", in which "the ego rejects the incompatible idea together with its affect and behaves as if the idea has never occurred to the ego at all."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "the Neuro-Psychoses of Defence", ''SE III''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954 basing himself on a reading of the "Wolf Man"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "From the History of an Infantile Neurosis", ''SE XVII''&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan identifies ''Verwerfung'' as the specific mechanism of psychosis where an element is rejected outside the symbolic order as if it has never existed.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'', "Reply to Jean Hyppolite's commentary on Freud's ''Negation''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 in his Seminar on Psychoses he translates ''Verwerfung'' as ''forclusion'', that is foreclosure.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''The Seminar. Book III. The Psychoses, 1955-56'', trans. Russell Grigg, New York, Norton, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  "Let us extract from several of Freud's texts a term that is sufficiently articulated in them to designate in them a function of the unconscious that is distinct from the repressed. Let us take as demonstrated the essence of my Seminar on the Psychoses, namely, that this term refers to psychosis: this term is ''Verwerfung'' (foreclosure)".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacan and psychosis==

The problematic Lacan sought to address with the twin tools of foreclosure and the signifier was that of the difference between psychosis and neurosis, as manifested in and indicated by language usage. It was common analytic ground that "when psychotics speak they always have some meanings that are too fixed, and some that are far too loose, they have a different relation to language, and a different way of speaking from neurotics."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Hill, ''Lacan for Beginners'' (London 1997) pp. 113 and 122&lt;/ref&gt; Freud, following [[Eugen Bleuler|Bleuler]] and [[Carl Jung|Jung]] had pointed to 'a number of changes in ''speech''...in schizophrenics...''words'' are subjected to the same process as that which makes the dream'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) pp. 202–4&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan used foreclosure to explain why.

When Lacan first uses the Freudian concept of ''Verwerfung'' (repudiation) in his search for a specific mechanism for psychosis, it is not clear what is repudiated (castration, speech). It is in 1957 in his article "On a question preliminary to any possible treatment of psychosis"&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' New York Norton, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; that he advances the notion that it is the [[Name-of-the-Father]] (a fundamental signifier) that is the object of foreclosure. In this way Lacan combines two of his main themes on the causality of psychosis: the absence of the father and the concept of ''Verwerfung''. This ideas remains central to Lacan's thinking on psychosis throughout the rest of his work.

Lacan considered the father to play a vital role in breaking the initial mother/child duality and introducing the child to the wider world of culture, language, institutions and social reality — the [[The Symbolic|Symbolic]] world — the father being "the human being who stands for the law and order that the mother plants in the life of the child...widens the child's view of the world."&lt;ref&gt;[[D. W. Winnicott]], ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Penguin 1973) pp. 115–6&lt;/ref&gt; The result in normal development is "proper separation from the mother, as marked out by the Names-of-the-father."&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Lacan postulates the existence of a paternal function (the "[[Name of the Father]]" or "primordial signifier") which allows the realm of [[the Symbolic]] to be bound to the realms of [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the Imaginary]] and [[the Real]]. This function prevents the developing child from being engulfed by its mother and allows him/her to emerge as a separate entity in his/her own right. It is a symbol of parental authority (a general symbol that represents the power of father of the [[Oedipus complex]]) that brings the child into the realm of the Symbolic by forcing him/her to act and to verbalise as an adult. As a result, the three realms are integrated in a way that is conducive to the creation of meaning and successful communication by means of what Lacan calls a [[Borromean knot]].

When the Name-of-the-Father is foreclosed for a particular subject, it leaves a hole in the Symbolic order which can never be filled. The subject can then be said to have a psychotic structure, even if he shows none of the classical signs of psychosis. When the foreclosed Name-of-the-Father re-appears in the Real, the subject is unable to assimilate it and the result of this collision between the subject and the inassimilable signifier of the Name-of-the-father is the entry into psychosis proper characterized by the onset of hallucinations and/or delusions.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Seminar III, ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, when the paternal function is "foreclosed" from the Symbolic order, the realm of the Symbolic is insufficiently bound to the realm of the Imaginary and failures in meaning may occur (the Borromean knot becomes undone and the three realms completely disconnected), with "a disorder caused at the most personal juncture between the subject and his sense of being alive."&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits, ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; Psychosis is experienced after some environmental sign in the form of a [[signifier]] which the individual cannot assimilate is triggered, and this entails that "the Name-of-the-Father, is foreclosed, ''verworfen'', is called into symbolic opposition to the subject."&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits, ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; The fabric of the individual's reality is ripped apart and no meaningful Symbolic sense can be made of experience. "Absence of transcendence of the Oedipus places the subject under the regime of foreclosure or non-distinction between the symbolic and the real';&lt;ref&gt;Anika Lemaire, ''Jacques Lacan'' (1979) p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; and psychotic [[delusions]] or [[hallucinations]] are the consequent result of the individual's striving to account for what he/she experiences.

{{emotion}}

'''Grief''' is a multifaceted response to loss, particularly to the loss of someone or something that has [[death|died]], to which a [[human bonding|bond]] or [[affection]] was formed. Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, spiritual and philosophical dimensions. While the terms are often used interchangeably, ''bereavement'' refers to the state of loss, and ''grief'' is the reaction to that loss.

Grief is a natural response to loss. It is the emotional suffering one feels when something or someone the individual loves is taken away. The grief associated with death is familiar to most people, but individuals grieve in connection with a variety of losses throughout their lives, such as unemployment, ill health or the end of a relationship.&lt;ref&gt;America, H. F. (2012). Grief.

Recently{{when|date=January 2018}}, there has been a high level of skepticism about the universal and predictable “emotional pathway” that leads from distress to “recovery” with an appreciation that grief is a more complex process of adapting to loss than stage and phase models have previously suggested. The Two-Track Model of Bereavement, created by Simon Shimshon Rubin in 1981, is a grief theory that provided deeper focus on the grieving process. The model examines the long-term effects of bereavement by measuring how well the person is adapting to the loss of a significant person in their life. The main objective of the Two-Track Model of Bereavement is for the individual to “manage and live in reality in which the deceased is absent” as well as returning to normal biological functioning. (Malkinson, 2006)

Track One is focused on the biopsychosocial functioning of grief. This focuses on the [[anxiety]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], somatic concerns, traumatic responses, familial relationships, interpersonal relationships, self-esteem, meaning structure, work, and investment in life tasks.  Rubin (2010) Points out, “Track 1, the range of aspects of the individuals functioning across affective, interpersonal, somatic and classical psychiatric indicators is considered”(Shimshon 686). All of the terms listed above are noted for the importance they have in relation to people’s responses to grief and loss.

The significance of the closeness between the bereaved and the deceased is important to Track 1 because this could determine the severity of the mourning and grief the bereaved will endure. This first track is the response to the extremely stressful life events and requires adaption along with change and integration.The second track focuses on the ongoing relationship you have with the deceased. Track two mainly focuses on how the bereaved was connected to the deceased and on what level of closeness was shared. The stronger the relationship to the deceased is will lead to a greater evaluation of the relationship with heightened shock. Track two brings up both the positive and negative memories that you shared with the deceased and the degree of emotional involvement you shared causing reflection.

Any memory could be a trigger for the bereaved, the way the bereaved chose to remember their loved one, and how the bereaved integrate the memory of their deceased into their daily lives.

Ten main attributes to this track include; imagery/memory, emotional distance, positive effect, negative effect, preoccupation with the loss, conflict, idealization, memorialization/transformation of the loss, impact on self-perception and loss process (shock, searching, disorganized) (Rubin, 1999). An outcome of this track is being able to recognize how transformation has occurred beyond grief and mourning (Rubin, 1999). By outlining the main aspects of the bereavement process into two interactive tracks, individuals can examine and understand how grief has affected their life following loss and begin to adapt to this post-loss life.The Model offers a better understanding with the duration of time in the wake of one's loss and the outcomes that evolve from death. By using this model, researchers can effectively examine the response to an individual’s loss by assessing the behavioral-psychological functioning and the relationship with the deceased.

The authors from ''[https://whatsyourgrief.com/rubin-two-track-model-of-bereavement/ Whats Your Grief?]'', Litza Williams and Eleanor Haley, state in their understanding of the clinical and therapeutic uses of the model:&lt;blockquote&gt;“in terms of functioning, this model can help the bereaved identify which areas of his/her life has been impacted by the grief in a negative way as well as areas that the bereaved has already begun to adapt to after the loss. If the bereaved is unable to return to their normal functioning as in before loss occurred, it is likely they will find difficulty in the process of working through the loss as well as their separation from the deceased.

Along the relational aspect, the bereaved can become aware of their relationship with the deceased and how it has changed or may change in the future” (Williams &amp; Haley, 2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://whatsyourgrief.com/rubin-two-track-model-of-bereavement/|title=Understanding The Two-Track Model of Bereavement - What's Your Grief|last=Williams|first=Litza|date=2017-01-12|work=What's Your Grief|access-date=2017-12-11|last2=Haley|first2=Eleanor|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;“The Two-Track Model of Bereavement can help specify areas of mutuality (how people respond affectivity to trauma and change) and also difference (how bereaved people may be preoccupied with the deceased following loss compared to how they may be preoccupied with trauma following the exposure to it)” (Rubin, S.S, 1999).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/doi/pdf/10.1080/074811899200731?needAccess=true&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bonanno's four trajectories of grief ===
{{Main|George Bonanno}}

George Bonanno, a [[professor]] of [[clinical psychology]] at [[Columbia University]], conducted more than two decades of scientific studies on grief and trauma, which have been published in several papers in the most respected peer-reviewed journals in the field of psychology, such as ''[[Psychological Science]]'' and ''The [[Journal of Abnormal Psychology]]''. Subjects of his studies number in the several thousand and include people who have suffered losses in the U.S. and cross-cultural studies in various countries around the world, such as Israel, [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], and China. His subjects suffered losses through war, [[terrorism]], deaths of children, premature deaths of spouses, [[sexual abuse]], childhood diagnoses of AIDS, and other potentially devastating loss events or potential trauma events.

In Bonanno's book, ''The Other Side of Sadness: What the New Science of Bereavement Tells Us About Life After a Loss'' ({{ISBN|978-0-465-01360-9}}), he summarizes his research.
His findings include that a natural resilience is the main component of grief and trauma reactions.&lt;ref name="americanPsychologistpdf"/&gt;  The first researcher to use pre-loss data, he outlined four trajectories of grief.&lt;ref name="americanPsychologistpdf"/&gt; Bonanno's work has also demonstrated that absence of grief or trauma symptoms is a healthy outcome, rather than something to be feared as has been the thought and practice until his research.&lt;ref name="SA_NTG" /&gt; Because grief responses can take many forms, including laughter, celebration, and bawdiness, in addition to sadness,&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giftofireland.com/Irishwakes.htm|title=The Irish Wake Tradition - Exploring Irish Wakes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonanno coined the phrase "coping ugly" to describe the idea that some forms of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] may seem counter intuitive.&lt;ref name="SA_NTG" /&gt; Bonanno has found that resilience is natural to humans, suggesting that it cannot be "taught" through specialized programs&lt;ref name="SA_NTG" /&gt; and that there is virtually no existing research with which to design resilience training, nor is there existing research to support major investment in such things as military resilience training programs.&lt;ref name="SA_NTG" /&gt;

The four trajectories are as follows:

* '''Resilience''': "The ability of adults in otherwise normal circumstances who are exposed to an isolated and potentially highly disruptive event, such as the death of a close relation or a violent or life-threatening situation, to maintain relatively stable, healthy levels of psychological and physical functioning" as well as "the capacity for generative experiences and positive emotions."
* '''Recovery''': When "normal functioning temporarily gives way to threshold or sub-threshold [[psychopathology]] (e.g., symptoms of depression or [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]], or PTSD), usually for a period of at least several months, and then gradually returns to pre-event levels."
* '''Chronic dysfunction''': Prolonged suffering and inability to function, usually lasting several years or longer.
* '''Delayed grief or trauma''': When adjustment seems normal but then distress and symptoms increase months later. Researchers have not found evidence of [[delayed grief]], but delayed trauma appears to be a genuine phenomenon.

The [[Kübler-Ross model]], commonly known as the five stages of grief, is a theory first introduced by [[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross]] in her 1969 book, ''On Death and Dying''.&lt;ref&gt;Broom, Sarah M. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,689491,00.html "Milestones: Aug. 30, 2004"], ''TIME'' website&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the uncredited earlier work of John Bowlby and Colin Murray-Parkes, Kübler-Ross actually applied the stages to persons who were dying, not persons who were grieving.  Her studies involved her work with the terminally ill. The popular but empirically unsupported model describes in five distinct stages how people deal with their impending death.

The five stages are:

# denial
# anger
# bargaining
# depression
# acceptance

The theory holds that the stages are a part of the framework that helps people learn to live without what they have lost.

The stages model, which came about in the 1960s, is a theory based on observation of people who are dying, not people who experienced the death of a loved one. This model found limited empirical support in a study by Maciejewski et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.297.7.716 |title=An Empirical Examination of the Stage Theory of Grief |year=2007 |last1=MacIejewski |first1=P.

G. |journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=297 |issue=7 |pages=716–23 |pmid=17312291}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is that the sequence was correct although Acceptance was highest at all points throughout the persons experience. The research of [[George Bonanno]], however, is acknowledged as debunking the five stages of grief because his large body of peer-reviewed studies show that the vast majority of people who have experienced a loss are resilient and that there are multiple trajectories following loss.

Studies of [[fMRI]] scans of women from whom grief was elicited about the death of a mother or a sister in the past 5 years resulted in the conclusion that grief produced a local inflammation response as measured by salivary concentrations of [[pro-inflammatory cytokine]]s. These responses were correlated with activation in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and [[orbitofrontal cortex]]. This activation also correlated with the free recall of grief-related word stimuli. This suggests that grief can cause stress, and that this reaction is linked to the emotional processing parts of the [[frontal lobe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.05.049 |title=When grief heats up: Pro-inflammatory cytokines predict regional brain activation |year=2009 |last1=O'Connor |first1=Mary-Frances |last2=Irwin |first2=Michael R. |last3=Wellisch |first3=David K. |journal=NeuroImage |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=891–6 |pmid=19481155 |pmc=2760985}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Activation of the anterior cingulate cortex and [[vagus nerve]] is similarly implicated in the experience of [[broken heart|heartbreak]] whether due to social rejection or bereavement.&lt;!-- refs on linked article --&gt;

Among those persons who have been bereaved within the previous three months of a given report, those who report many intrusive thoughts about the deceased show ventral [[amygdala]] and rostral [[anterior cingulate cortex]] hyperactivity to reminders of their loss. In the case of the amygdala, this links to their sadness intensity. In those individuals who avoid such thoughts, there is a related opposite type of pattern in which there is a decrease in the activation of the dorsal amgydala and the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]].

In those not so emotionally affected by reminders of their loss, studies of [[fMRI]] scans have been used to conclude that there is a high functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and amygdala activity, suggesting that the former regulates activity in the latter. In those people who had greater intensity of sadness, there was a low functional connection between the rostal anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala activity, suggesting a lack of regulation of the former part of the brain upon the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.01.019 |title=Neural Mechanisms of Grief Regulation |year=2009 |last1=Freed |first1=Peter J. |last2=Yanagihara |first2=Ted K. |last3=Hirsch |first3=Joy |last4=Mann |first4=J. John |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=66 |pages=33–40 |pmid=19249748 |issue=1 |pmc=2782609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary theories ==

From an evolutionary perspective, grief is perplexing because it appears costly, and it is not clear what benefits it provides the sufferer. Several researchers have proposed functional explanations for grief, attempting to solve this puzzle. Sigmund Freud argued that grief is a process of libidinal reinvestment. The griever must, Freud argued, disinvest from the deceased, which is a painful process.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1957). Mourning and Melancholia. In J. Strachey (Ed. and Trans.), ''The standard edition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud'' (Vol. 14, pp. 152-170). London, England: Hogarth Press. (Original work published 1917)&lt;/ref&gt; But this disinvestment allows the griever to use libidinal energies on other, possibly new attachments, so it provides a valuable function. John Archer, approaching grief from an attachment theory perspective, argued that grief is a byproduct of the human attachment system.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, J. (1999). ''The nature of grief: The evolution and psychology of reactions to loss''. London, England: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, a grief-type response is adaptive because it compels a social organism to search for a lost individual (e.g., a mother or a child). However, in the case of death, the response is maladaptive because the individual is not simply lost and the griever cannot reunite with the deceased. Grief, from this perspective, is a painful cost of the human capacity to form commitments.

Other researchers such as Randolph Nesse have proposed that grief is a kind of psychological pain that orients the sufferer to a new existence without the deceased and creates a painful but instructive memory.&lt;ref&gt;Nesse, R. M. (2005). An evolutionary framework for understanding grief. In D. Carr, R. M. Nesse, &amp; C. B. Wortman (Eds.), ''Late life widowhood in the United States: Spousal bereavement in late life'' (pp. 195-226). New York, New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; If, for example, leaving an offspring alone at a watering hole led to the offspring’s death, grief creates an intensively painful memory of the event, dissuading a parent from ever again leaving an offspring alone at a watering hole.  More recently, Winegard, Reynolds, Winegard, Baumeister, and Maner argued that grief might be a socially selected signal of an individual’s propensity for forming strong, committed relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Winegard B. M. |author2=Reynolds T. |author3=Baumeister R. F. |author4=Winegard B. |author5=Maner J. K. | year = 2014 | title = Grief functions as an honest indicator of commitment | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 168–186 | doi=10.1177/1088868314521016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this social signaling perspective, grief targets old and new social partners, informing them that the griever is capable of forming strong social commitments. That is, because grief signals a person's capacity to form strong and faithful social bonds, those who displayed prolonged grief responses were preferentially chosen by alliance partners. The authors argue that throughout human evolution, grief was therefore shaped and elaborated by the social decisions of selective alliance partners.

== Risks ==

Bereavement, while a normal part of life, carries a degree of risk when severe. Severe reactions affect approximately 10% to 15% of people.&lt;ref name="americanPsychologistpdf"/&gt; Severe reactions mainly occur in people with depression present before the loss event.&lt;ref name="americanPsychologistpdf"/&gt; Severe grief reactions may carry over into family relations. Some researchers have found an increased risk of marital breakup following the death of a child, for example. Others have found no increase. John James, author of the Grief Recovery Handbook and founder of the Grief Recovery Institute, reported that his marriage broke up after the death of his infant son.

Many studies have looked at the bereaved in terms of increased risks for stress-related illnesses. [[Colin Murray Parkes]] in the 1960s and 1970s in England noted increased doctor visits, with symptoms such as abdominal pain, breathing difficulties, and so forth in the first six months following a death. Others have noted increased mortality rates (Ward, A.W. 1976) and Bunch et al. found a five times greater risk of [[suicide]] in teens following the death of a parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00578368 |title=Suicide following bereavement of parents |year=1971 |last1=Bunch |first1=J. |last2=Barraclough |first2=B. |last3=Nelson |first3=B. |last4=Sainsbury |first4=P. |journal=Social Psychiatry |volume=6 |issue=4 |page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complicated grief ==

[[Prolonged grief disorder|Prolonged grief disorder (PGD)]], formerly known as [[Complicated grief disorder|complicated grief disorder (CGD)]], is a pathological reaction to loss representing a cluster of empirically derived symptoms that have been associated with long-term physical and psycho-social dysfunction. Individuals with PGD experience severe grief symptoms for at least six months and are stuck in a maladaptive state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lichtentahl|first=W.

Critics of including the diagnosis of complicated grief in the DSM-5 say that doing so will constitute characterizing a natural response as a pathology, and will result in wholesale medicating of people who are essentially normal.&lt;ref name="NYTimes_Frances_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wakefield, Jerome C|year=2012|title=Should prolonged grief be reclassified as a mental disorder in DSM-5?: reconsidering the empirical and conceptual arguments for complicated grief disorder|journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|publisher=LWW|volume=200|pages=499–511|doi=10.1097/NMD.0b013e3182482155|number=6}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2014-02-15--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Shear and colleagues found an effective treatment for complicated grief, by treating the reactions in the same way as trauma reactions.&lt;ref name="Bonanno2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2850.2006.00014.x |title=Is Complicated Grief a Valid Construct? |year=2006 |last1=Bonanno |first1=George A. |journal=Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice |volume=13 |issue=2 |page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.293.21.2601 |title=Treatment of Complicated Grief: A Randomized Controlled Trial |year=2005 |last1=Shear |first1=K. |journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=293 |issue=21 |page=2601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complicated grief is not synonymous with grief. Complicated grief is characterised by an extended grieving period and other criteria, including mental and physical impairments.&lt;ref name="Pmid"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2011.02.021 |title=The prevalence and characteristics of complicated grief in older adults |year=2011 |last1=Newson |first1=Rachel S. |last2=Boelen |first2=Paul A. |last3=Hek |first3=Karin |last4=Hofman |first4=Albert |last5=Tiemeier |first5=Henning |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=132 |pages=231–8 |pmid=21397336 |issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important part of understanding complicated grief is understanding how the symptoms differ from normal grief. The Mayo Clinic states that with normal grief the feelings of loss are evident. When the reaction turns into complicated grief, however, the feelings of loss become incapacitating and continue even though time passes.&lt;ref name="mayoclinic"&gt;Mayo Clinic Staff, (2011, Sept. 29). In Complicated grief. Retrieved May 20, 2012, from http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/complicated-grief/DS01023&lt;/ref&gt; The signs and symptoms characteristic of complicated grief are listed as "extreme focus on the loss and reminders of the loved one, intense longing or pining for the deceased, problems accepting the death, numbness or detachment… bitterness about your loss, inability to enjoy life, depression or deep sadness, trouble carrying out normal routines, withdrawing from social activities, feeling that life holds no meaning or purpose, irritability or agitation, lack of trust in others."&lt;ref name="mayoclinic" /&gt; The symptoms seen in complicated grief are specific because the symptoms seem to be a combination of the symptoms found in separation as well as traumatic distress. They are also considered to be complicated because, unlike normal grief, these symptoms will continue regardless of the amount of time that has passed and despite treatment given from tricyclic antidepressants.&lt;ref name="Doiannurevmed"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenzweig |first1=Andrew |last2=Prigerson |first2=Holly |last3=Miller |first3=Mark D. |last4=Reynolds |first4=Charles F. |title=Bereavement and Late-Life Depression: Grief and Its Complications in the Elderly |journal=Annual Review of Medicine |volume=48 |issue= |pages=421–8 |year=1997 |pmid=9046973 |doi=10.1146/annurev.med.48.1.421 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study "Bereavement and Late-Life Depression: Grief and its Complications in the Elderly" six subjects with symptoms of complicated grief were given a dose of Paroxetine, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, and showed a 50% decrease in their symptoms within a three-month period. The Mental Health Clinical Research team theorizes that the symptoms of complicated grief in bereaved elderly are an alternative of post-traumatic stress. These symptoms were correlated with cancer, hypertension, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, increased smoking, and sleep impairments at around six months after spousal death.&lt;ref name="Doiannurevmed" /&gt;

A treatment that has been found beneficial in dealing with the symptoms associated with complicated grief is the use of serotonin specific reuptake inhibitors such as Paroxetine. These inhibitors have been found to reduce intrusive thoughts, avoidant behaviors, and hyperarousal that are associated with complicated grief.  In addition psychotherapy techniques are in the process of being developed.&lt;ref name="Doiannurevmed" /&gt;

=== Death of a child ===
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;big&gt;“It is a fearful thing to love&lt;br/&gt; What Death can touch.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;small&gt;Josephine Jacobson, ''The Instant of Knowing'' (Library of Congress, 1974), 7.&lt;/small&gt;|width=15em|fontsize = 100%|bgcolor = #F0F0F0}}

Death of a child can take the form of a loss in infancy such as [[miscarriage]] or [[stillbirth]]&lt;ref&gt;For a true account of one couples' experience with the stillbirth of their baby, see Brad Stetson, ''Tender Fingerprints: A True Story of Loss and Resolution'', (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; or neonatal death, [[Sudden infant death syndrome|SIDS]], or the death of an older child. In most cases, parents find the grief almost unbearably devastating, and it tends to hold greater risk factors than any other loss. This loss also bears a lifelong process: one does not get 'over' the death but instead must assimilate and live with it.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of this process, see Brad Stetson, ''Living Victims, Stolen Lives: Parents of Murdered Children Speak to America'', (Amityville, N. Y.: Belsey, A. (1998). Journalism and Ethics: Can They Co-exist? Matthew Kieran 
(Ed), 1-14. Retrieved from https://link.library.curtin.edu.au/ereserve/DC60130697/0?display=1
 Press, 2003).{{Page needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intervention and comforting support can make all the difference to the survival of a parent in this type of grief but the risk factors are great and may include family breakup or suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/emotional_problems_psychologist/psychologist_grief.htm|title=Grief|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Citation needed, because the first reference in this paragraph is not a reliable source, and the second reference is specific for murdered children --&gt;

Feelings of guilt, whether legitimate or not, are pervasive, and the dependent nature of the relationship disposes parents to a variety of problems as they seek to cope with this great loss. Parents who suffer miscarriage or a regretful or coerced abortion may experience resentment towards others who experience successful pregnancies.

=== Suicide ===

Suicide rates are growing worldwide and over the last thirty years there has been international research trying to curb this phenomenon and gather knowledge about who is "at-risk". When a parent loses their child through suicide it is traumatic, sudden and affects all loved ones impacted by this child. Suicide leaves many unanswered questions and leaves most parents feeling hurt, angry and deeply saddened by such a loss. Parents may feel they can't openly discuss their grief and feel their emotions because of how their child died and how the people around them may perceive the situation. Parents, family members and service providers have all confirmed the unique nature of suicide-related bereavement following the loss of a child. They report a wall of silence that goes up around them and how people interact towards them. One of the best ways to grieve and move on from this type of loss is to find ways to keep that child as an active part of their lives. It might be privately at first but as parents move away from the silence they can move into a more proactive healing time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = maple|first = M|author2 = Edwards, H|author3 = Minichello V|title = Silenced Voices: hearing the stories of parents bereaved through suicide death of a young adult child|journal = Health and Social care in the community|date = May 2010|volume = 18|issue = 3|pages = 241–248|doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2524.2009.00886.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate = 20 April 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death of a spouse ===
The death of a spouse is usually a particularly powerful loss. A spouse often becomes part of the other in a unique way:  many [[Widow|widows and widowers]] describe losing 'half' of themselves. The days, months and years after the loss of a spouse will never be the same and learning to live without them may be harder than one would expect.  The grief experience is unique to each person.  Sharing and building a life with another human being, then learning to live singularly, can be an adjustment that is more complex than a person could ever expect.

After a long marriage, at older ages, the elderly may find it a very difficult assimilation to begin anew; but at younger ages as well, a marriage relationship was often a profound one for the survivor.

A factor is the manner in which the spouse died.  The survivor of a spouse who died of an illness has a different experience of such loss than a survivor of a spouse who died by an act of violence.  The grief, in all events, however, can always be of the most profound sort to the widow and the widower.  Emotional unsteadiness, bouts of crying, helplessness and hopelessness are just a small sample of what a widow or widower can expect to face.  Depression and loneliness are very common.  Feeling bitter and resentful are normal feelings for the spouse who is "left behind".  Oftentimes, the widow/widower may feel it necessary to seek professional help in dealing with their new life.

Furthermore, most couples have a division of 'tasks' or 'labor', e.g., the husband mows the yard, the wife pays the bills, etc. which, in addition to dealing with great grief and life changes, means added responsibilities for the bereaved. Immediately after the death of a spouse, there are tasks that must be completed.  Planning and financing a funeral can be very difficult if pre-planning was not completed.  Changes in insurance, bank accounts, claiming of life insurance, securing childcare are just some of the issues that can be intimidating to someone who is grieving.  Social isolation may also become imminent, as many groups composed of couples find it difficult to adjust to the new identity of the bereaved, and the bereaved themselves have great challenges in reconnecting with others. Widows of many cultures, for instance, wear black for the rest of their lives to signify the loss of their spouse and their grief. Only in more recent decades has this tradition been reduced to a period of two years, while some religions such as Christian Orthodox many widows will still continue to wear black for the remainder of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;See Gerald Rochelle, Goodbye: grief from beginning to end, Cambridge House, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death of a parent ===

For a child, the death of a parent, without support to manage the effects of the grief, may result in long-term psychological harm. This is more likely if the adult carers are struggling with their own grief and are psychologically unavailable to the child. There is a critical role of the surviving parent or caregiver in helping the children adapt to a parent's death. Studies have shown that losing a parent at a young age did not just lead to negative outcomes; there are some positive effects. Some children had an increased maturity, better coping skills and improved communication. Adolescents valued other people more than those who have not experienced such a close loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=J|author2=Lloyd-Williams, M|title=Perspectives on the impact of early parent loss in adulthood in the UK: narratives provide the way forward|journal=European Journal of Cancer Care|date=July 2008|pages=317–318|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2354.2008.00963.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an adult child loses a parent in later adulthood, it is considered to be "timely" and to be a normative life course event. This allows the adult children to feel a permitted level of grief. However, research shows that the death of a parent in an adult's midlife is not a normative event by any measure, but is a major life transition causing an evaluation of one's own life or mortality. Others may shut out friends and family in processing the loss of someone with whom they have had the longest relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marshall|first=H|title=Midlife loss of parents: The Transition from Adult Child to Orphan|journal=Ageing International|year=2004|volume=29|issue=4|pages=351–367|doi=10.1007/s12126-004-1004-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An adult may be expected to cope with the death of a parent in a less emotional way; however, the loss can still invoke extremely powerful emotions. This is especially true when the death occurs at an important or difficult period of life, such as when becoming a parent, at graduation, or at other times of emotional stress. It is important to recognize the effects that the loss of a parent can cause, and to address these effects. For an adult, the willingness to be open to grief is often diminished. A failure to accept and deal with loss will only result in further pain and suffering. “Mourning is the open expression of your thoughts and feelings about the death. It is an essential part of healing.”&lt;ref&gt;Alan D. Wolfelt, Ph.D., “Helping Yourself Heal When a Parent Dies” online at http://griefwords.com/index.cgi?action=page&amp;page=articles%2Fhelping4.html&amp;site_id=2.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death of a sibling ===

The loss of a sibling can be a devastating life event. Despite this, sibling grief is often the most disenfranchised or overlooked of the four main forms of grief, especially with regard to adult siblings. Grieving siblings are often referred to as the 'forgotten mourners' who are made to feel as if their grief is not as severe as their parents grief (N.a., 2015).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cancer.net/coping-with-cancer/managing-emotions/grief-and-loss/grieving-loss-sibling/1&lt;/ref&gt; However, the sibling relationship tends to be the longest significant relationship of the lifespan and siblings who have been part of each other's lives since birth, such as twins, help form and sustain each other's identities; with the death of one sibling comes the loss of that part of the survivor's identity because “your identity is based on having them there.”&lt;ref&gt;P. Gill White, Ph.D., “Loss of an Adult Sibling” online at http://www.counselingstlouis.net/page22.html. Accessed September 7, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sibling relationship is a unique one, as they share a special bond and a common history from birth, have a certain role and place in the family, often complement each other, and share genetic traits. Siblings who enjoy a close relationship participate in each other's daily lives and special events, confide in each other, share joys, spend leisure time together (whether they are children or adults), and have a relationship that not only exists in the present but often looks toward a future together (even into retirement). Surviving siblings lose this “companionship and a future” with their deceased siblings.&lt;ref&gt;P. Gill White, ''Sibling Grief: Healing After the Death of a Sister or Brother '' (iUniverse, 2006), 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Siblings who play a major part in each other's lives are essential to each other. Adult siblings eventually expect the loss of aging parents, the only other people who have been an integral part of their lives since birth, but they do not expect to lose their siblings early; as a result, when a sibling dies, the surviving sibling may experience a longer period of shock and disbelief.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Overall, with the loss of a sibling, a substantial part of the surviving sibling's past, present, and future is also lost. If siblings were not on good terms or close with each other, then intense feelings of guilt may ensue on the part of the surviving sibling (guilt may also ensue for having survived, not being able to prevent the death, having argued with their sibling, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;"Understanding Sibling Loss", CIGNA; ''Sibling Grief'', P. Gill White, Ph.D.; and ''Surviving the Death of a Sibling'', T.J. Wray.{{Page needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loss during childhood ===

When a parent or caregiver dies or leaves, children may have symptoms of psychopathology, but they are less severe than in children with major depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.chi.0000215327.58799.05 |title=Childhood Bereavement: Psychopathology in the 2 Years Postparental Death |year=2006 |last1=Cerel |first1=Julie |last2=Fristad |first2=Mary A. |last3=Verducci |first3=Joseph |last4=Weller |first4=Ronald A. |last5=Weller |first5=Elizabeth B. |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=681–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of a parent, grandparent or sibling can be very troubling in childhood, but even in childhood there are age differences in relation to the loss. A very young child, under one or two, may be found to have no reaction if a carer dies, but other children may be affected by the loss.

At a time when trust and dependency are formed, a break even of no more than separation can cause problems in well-being; this is especially true if the loss is around critical periods such as 8–12 months, when attachment and separation are at their height  information, and even a brief separation from a parent or other person who cares for the child can cause distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Mary D. Salter |last1=Ainsworth |first2=Silvia M. |last2=Bell |title=Attachment, Exploration, and Separation: Illustrated by the Behavior of One-Year-Olds in a Strange Situation |journal=Child Development |jstor=1127388 |pmid=5490680 |pages=49–67 |volume=41 |issue=1 |year=1970 |doi=10.2307/1127388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even as a child grows older, death is still difficult to fathom and this affects how a child responds. For example, younger children see death more as a separation, and may believe death is curable or temporary. Reactions can manifest themselves in "acting out" behaviors: a return to earlier behaviors such as sucking thumbs, clinging to a toy or angry behavior; though they do not have the maturity to mourn as an adult, they feel the same intensity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} As children enter pre-teen and teen years, there is a more mature understanding.

Adolescents may respond by [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquency]], or oppositely become "over-achievers": repetitive actions are not uncommon such as washing a car repeatedly or taking up repetitive tasks such as sewing, computer games, etc. It is an effort to stay above the grief.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Childhood loss as mentioned before can predispose a child not only to physical illness but to emotional problems and an increased risk for suicide, especially in the adolescent period.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Children can experience grief as a result of losses due to causes other than death. For example, children who have been physically, psychologically or sexually abused often grieve over the damage to or the loss of their ability to trust. Since such children usually have no support or acknowledgement from any source outside the family unit, this is likely to be experienced as [[disenfranchised grief]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

[[Relocation (personal)|Relocation]]s can cause children significant grief particularly if they are combined with other difficult circumstances such as neglectful or abusive parental behaviors, other significant losses, etc.&lt;ref name="NITLC Brief Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tlcinst.org/Moving.html |title=Moving Can Become Traumatic |last1=Sheppard |first1=Caroline H. |first2=William |last2=Steele |year=2003 |work=Trauma and Loss: Research and Interventions |publisher=Nat'l Inst for Trauma and Loss in Children |accessdate=22 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507104808/http://www.tlcinst.org/Moving.html |archivedate=May 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iowa State University paper by Lesia Oesterreich"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/PM1529G.pdf|title=Understanding children: moving to a new home|last=Oesterreich|first=Lesia|date=April 2004|publisher=Iowa State University|accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Loss of a friend or classmate ====

Children may experience the death of a friend or a classmate through illness, accidents, suicide, or violence.  Initial support involves reassuring children that their emotional and physical feelings are normal.  Schools are advised to plan for these possibilities in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leek Openshaw|first=L|title=School-based support groups for traumatized students|journal=School Psychology International|date=April 2011|volume=32|issue=2|pages=163–178|doi=10.1177/0143034311400830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Survivor guilt]] (or survivor's guilt; also called survivor syndrome or survivor's syndrome) is a mental condition that occurs when a person perceives themselves to have done wrong by surviving a traumatic event when others did not. It may be found among survivors of combat, natural disasters, epidemics, among the friends and family of those who have died by suicide, and in non-mortal situations such as among those whose colleagues are laid off.

=== Other losses ===

[[File:FEMA - 29783 - Workers unemployed by the freeze in California.jpg|thumb|right|250px|People who become unemployed, such as these California workers, may face grief from the loss of their job]]

Parents may grieve due to loss of children through means other than death, for example through loss of [[child custody|custody]] in divorce proceedings; legal termination of [[parental responsibility (access and custody)|parental right]]s by the government, such as in cases of [[child abuse]]; through kidnapping; because the child voluntarily left home (either as a runaway or, for overage children, by leaving home legally); or because an adult refuses or is unable to have contact with a parent.  This loss differs from the death of a child in that the grief process is prolonged or denied because of hope that the relationship will be restored.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Grief may occur after the loss of a romantic relationship (i.e. divorce or break up), a vocation, a pet ([[animal loss]]), a home, children leaving home ([[empty nest syndrome]]), sibling(s) leaving home, a friend, a faith in one's religion, etc. A person who strongly identifies with their occupation may feel a sense of grief if they have to stop their job due to retirement, being laid off, injury, or loss of certification. Those who have experienced a loss of trust will often also experience some form of grief.&lt;ref&gt;John W. James and Russell Friedman, ''The Grief Recovery Handbook, 20th Anniversary Expanded Edition'' (William Morrow Paperbacks, 2009), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gradual bereavement ===

Many of the above examples of bereavement happen abruptly, but there are also cases of being gradually bereft of something or someone. For example, the gradual loss of a loved one by Alzheimer's produces a “gradual grief.” &lt;ref&gt;“The Gradual Grief of Alzheimer's” in ''Christianity Today'', 48:2 (Feb 2004). Online at http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2004/february/8.64.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

The author Kara Tippetts described her dying of cancer, as dying “by degrees”: her “body failing” and her “abilities vanishing.”&lt;ref&gt;Kara Tippetts, “By Degrees-Living and Dying” on “Mundane Faithfulness” at http://www.mundanefaithfulness.com/2014/12/29/by-degrees-living-and-dying. Accessed June 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
Milton Crum, writing about gradual bereavement says that “every degree of death, every death of a person’s characteristics, every death of a person’s abilities, is a bereavement.”&lt;ref&gt;Milton Crum, “Bereavement: Long Term” online at http://www.ahpcc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/milton-crum---bereavement.pdf, the website of the Association of Hospice and Palliative Care Chaplains in the UK. Accessed August 7, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Macklin Intergenerational Institute's Xtreme Aging program has an exercise to simulate gradual bereavement. Lay out three sets of five pieces of note paper on a table. On set #1, write your five most enjoyed activities; on set #2, write your five most valued possessions; on set #3, write your five most loved people. Then “lose” them one by one, trying to feel each loss, until you have lost them all.&lt;ref&gt;Milton Crum, “I’m Old,” 53. Online in the Virginia Theological Seminary Bishop Payne Library at http://www.vts.edu/ftpimages/95/download/Milton%20Crum%20I%20AM%20OLD%202011%5B4%5D_resources.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support ==

=== Professional support ===

Many people who grieve do not need professional help.&lt;ref&gt;”Finding Grief Support That is Right for You” at http://www.griefhealingblog.com/2010/04/finding-grief-support-that-is-right-for.html. Accessed September 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Some, however, may seek additional support from licensed [[psychologist]]s or [[psychiatrist]]s. And support resources available to the bereaved may include [[grief counseling]], professional support-groups or educational classes, and peer-led support groups. In the United States of America, local [[hospice]] agencies may provide a first contact for those seeking bereavement support.&lt;ref&gt;“Interim Hospice Bereavement and Grief” at http://www.interimhealthcare.com/services/hospice/bereavement-services. Accessed September 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to recognize when grief has turned into something more serious, thus mandating contacting a medical professional. Grief can result in depression or alcohol- and drug-abuse and, if left untreated, it can become severe enough to impact daily living.&lt;ref name="nlm"&gt;{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|001530|Grief}}&lt;/ref&gt; It recommends contacting a medical professional if "you can’t deal with grief, you are using excessive amounts of drugs or alcohol, you become very depressed, or you have prolonged depression that interferes with your daily life."&lt;ref name="nlm" /&gt; Other reasons to seek medical attention may include: "Can focus on little else but your loved one’s death, have persistent pining or longing for the deceased person, have thoughts of guilt or self-blame, believe that you did something wrong or could have prevented the death, feel as if life isn’t worth living, have lost your sense of purpose in life, wish you had died along with your loved one."&lt;ref name="mayoclinic" /&gt;

Professionals can use multiple ways to help someone cope and move through their grief. Hypnosis  is sometimes used as an adjunct therapy in helping patients experiencing grief.&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Hypnotherapy for Traumatic Grief: Janetian and Modern Approaches Integrated |last1= van der Hart |first1=Onno |first2=Paul |last2=Brown |first3=Ronald N. |last3=Turco pages 263-271 |journal=American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis |volume=32 |issue=4 |year=1990 |doi=10.1080/00029157.1990.10402833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypnosis enhances and facilitates mourning and helps patients to resolve traumatic grief.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.onnovdhart.nl/articles/traumaticgrief.pdf |title=Hypnotherapy for Traumatic Grief: Janetian and modern approaches integrated |journal=American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis |last1=Hart |first1=O. |last2=Brown |first2=P. |last3=Turco |first3=R.N. |date=April 1989 |volume=32 |number=4 |pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lichtenthal and Cruess (2010) studied  how bereavement-specific written disclosure had benefits in helping adjust to loss, and in helping improve the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), prolonged grief disorder, and depression. Directed writing helped  many of the individuals who had experienced a loss of a significant relationship. It involved individuals trying to make meaning out of the loss through '''sense making''', (making sense of what happened and the cause of the death), or through [[benefit finding]] (consideration of the global significance of the loss of one's goals, and helping the family develop a greater appreciation of life). This [[meaning-making]] can come naturally for some, but many need direct intervention to "move on".&lt;ref&gt;

=== Support groups ===
* '''Our House''' is a non-profit Grief Support Center located in Southern California that specifically helps children heal from the loss of a parent, sibling, or close relative. It hosts several programs, support groups, and camps to give individuals the space needed to grieve. Camp Erin takes place bi-annually and volunteers do crafts with children. This is also an opportunity for children to meet other children in similar situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ourhouse-grief.org/|title=Main Page|website=Our House Grief Support Center|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Griefshare support Group''' -  Griefshare is a Bible-based support group sponsored by many churches across the country for the loss of a loved one. It is a 13-week support group that covers topics such as What is normal, Challenges of grief, Relationships, Why?, Complicating factors,  Stuck in grief, what do I live for now?.  This is a very powerful support group that gives people the tools to move through their grief in a healthy manner.  The 3 components of Griefshare are 1- video's, 2- group discussion time, 3- and workbook.  To find local church's in your area that have this support group

* [[The Compassionate Friends]] &amp;ndash; support group for bereaved parents, siblings and grandparents.  National organisations in most English-speaking countries, with comprehensive system of local groups.
* [[Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society]] (SANDS) - runs a [https://www.sands.org.uk/support/how-we-offer-support/sands-groups UK-wide network of local support groups].

== Cultural differences in grieving ==
{{Main|Mourning}}
Each culture specifies manners such as rituals, styles of dress, or other habits, as well as attitudes, in which the bereaved are encouraged or expected to take part. An analysis of non-Western cultures suggests that beliefs about continuing ties with the deceased varies. In Japan, maintenance of ties with the deceased is accepted and carried out through religious rituals. In the Hopi of Arizona, the deceased are quickly forgotten and life continues on.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Different cultures grieve in different ways, but all have ways that are vital in healthy coping with the death of a loved one.&lt;ref&gt;Santrock, J. W. (2007). ''A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development''-4th ed. New York : McGraw-Hill Higher Education.{{Page needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American family's approach to grieving was depicted in "The Grief Committee", by [[T. Glen Coughlin]]. The short story gives an inside look at how the American culture has learned to cope with the tribulations and difficulties of grief. (The story is taught in the course, The Politics of Mourning: Grief Management in a Cross-Cultural Fiction. Columbia University)&lt;ref&gt;The Politics of Mourning: Grief Management in a Cross-Cultural Fiction, by Rochelle Almeida, 2004 by Rosemont Publishing Company, Associated University Press.{{Page needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In those with cognitive impairment ==

Some believe that those who have a high degree of cognitive impairment, such as an intellectual disability, are unable to process the loss of those around them, but this is untrue, those with cognitive impairments such as an intellectual disability are able to process grief in a similar manner to those without cognitive impairment.&lt;ref&gt;McRitchie, R., McKenzie, K., Quayle, E., Harlin, M., Neumann, K. (2014). How adults with intellectual disability experience bereavement and grief: a qualitative exploration. Death Studies, 38(3), 179-185.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main differences between those with an intellectual disability and those without, is typically the ability to verbalize their feelings about the loss, which is why non-verbal cues and changes in behavior become so important, because these are usually signs of distress and expression of grief among this population.&lt;ref&gt;Gilrane-McGarry, U., Taggart, L. (2007). An exploration of the support received by people with intellectual disabilities who have been bereaved. Journal of Research in Nursing, 12(2), 129-144.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important when working with individuals with these such impairments that caregivers and family members meet them where their level of functioning is and allow them to process the loss and grief with assistance given where needed, and not to ignore the grief that these individuals undergo.&lt;ref&gt;McEvoy, J., Smith, E. (2005).

Families perceptions of the grieving process and concept of death in individuals with intellectual disabilities. British Journal of Developmental Disabilities, 51(100, pt.1), 17-25.&lt;/ref&gt; An important aspect of treatment of grief for those with an intellectual disability is family involvement where possible, this can be a biological family or a family created in a group home or clinical setting. By having the family involved in an open and supporting dialogue with the individual it helps them to process. However, if the family is not properly educated on how these individuals handle loss, their involvement may not be as beneficial than those who are educated. The importance of the family unit is very crucial in a soci-cognitive approach to bereavement counseling. In this approach the individual with intellectual disability has the opportunity to see how those around them handle the loss and have the opportunity to act accordingly by modeling behavior. This approach also helps the individual know that their emotions are ok and normal.&lt;ref&gt;Clute, M. (2010). Bereavement interventions for adults with intellectual disabilities: what works. Omega: Journal of Death and Dying, 61(2), 163-177.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In animals ==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2011}}
[[File:August Friedrich Albrecht Schenck - Anguish - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|In [[August Friedrich Schenck]]'s 1878 painting ''Anguish'', held at the [[National Gallery of Victoria]], a grieving ewe mourns the death of her lamb.]]
Previously it was believed that grief was only a human emotion, but studies have shown that other animals have shown grief or grief-like states during the death of another animal. This can occur between bonded animals which are animals that attempt to survive together (i.e. a pack of wolves or mated prairie voles).

=== Mammals ===
Mammals have demonstrated grief-like states, especially between a mother and her offspring. She will often stay close to her dead offspring for short periods of time and may investigate the reasons for the baby's non-response. For example, some [[deer]] will often sniff, poke, and look at its lifeless fawn before realising it is dead and leaving it to rejoin the herd shortly afterwards. Other animals, such as a [[lion]]ess, will pick up its cub in its mouth and place it somewhere else before abandoning it.

When a baby [[chimpanzee]] or [[gorilla]] dies, the mother will carry the body around for several days before it may finally be able to move on without it; this behavior has been observed in other [[primates]], as well. [[Jane Goodall]] has described chimpanzees as exhibiting mournful behavior toward the loss of a group member with silence and by showing more attention to it. And they will often continue grooming it and stay close to the carcass until the group must move on without it. Another notable example is [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]], a gorilla that uses [[sign language]], who expressed sadness and even described sadness about the death of her pet cat, All Ball.

[[Elephant]]s, have shown unusual behavior upon encountering the remains of another deceased elephant. They will often investigate it by touching and grabbing it with their trunks and have the whole herd stand around it for long periods of time until they must leave it behind. It is unknown whether they are mourning over it and showing sympathy, or are just curious and investigating the dead body. Elephants are thought to be able to discern relatives even from their remains. An episode of the acclaimed BBC Documentary [[Life on Earth (TV series)|Life on Earth]] shows this in detail - The elephants, upon finding a dead herd member, pause for several minutes at a time, and carefully touch and hold the dead creature's bones.

=== Birds ===
Some birds seem to lack the perception of grief or quickly accept it- for example, [[Mallard]] hens, although shocked for a moment when losing one of their young to a predator, will soon return to doing what they were doing before the predator attacked. However, some other waterbirds, such as [[Mute swan]]s, are known to grieve for the loss of a partner or cygnet, and are known to engage in pining for days, weeks or even months at a time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theswansanctuary.org.uk/faq.php Frequently Asked Questions about Swans] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929170937/http://www.theswansanctuary.org.uk/faq.php |date=September 29, 2015 }}, The Swan Sanctuary&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monogamous animals ===
Another form of grief in animals is when an individual loses its mate; this can be especially brutal when the species is [[monogamous]]. So when a [[pair bonding]] species, such as a [[black-backed jackal]], loses its mate it can be very difficult for it to detach itself from its dead mate.

[[Hypnosis]] or [[Hypnotherapy|hypnotherapeutic procedures]] may be included as part of an intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Astin, J.A., Shapiro, S.L., Eisenberg, D.

Investigators, clinicians, and research authors frequently analyze and discuss the effects and efficacy of this intervention as a whole, with the result that it is often difficult to attribute positive or negative outcomes to any of the specific techniques that contribute to guided meditation. Furthermore, the term "guided meditation" is frequently used interchangeably with the terms "guided imagery" and sometimes with "creative visualization" in [[popular psychology]] and [[Self help|self-help]] literature, and to a lesser extent in [[Scholarly method|scholarly]] and [[Scientific method|scientific]] publications. Consequently, understanding the nature, scope, application, and limitations of guided meditation requires it to be considered in context and relationship to the multiple techniques that are integral to its practice, allowing for variations in terminology.&lt;ref&gt;Astin, J.A., Shapiro, S.L., Eisenberg, D.

'''Henry Hodgkin''' (1877-1933) was a [[medical doctor]] and a British [[Quaker]] [[missionary]] who, in the course of his 55-year life, co-founded the [[West China Union University]] in [[Chengdu]], co-founded and led the first [[Christian pacifist]] movement, the [[International Fellowship of Reconciliation]], and founded the [[Pendle Hill Quaker Center for Study and Contemplation|Pendle Hill Quaker meeting and training center]], in [[Wallingford, Pennsylvania]].

==Life==

===Early Years===
Henry Theodore Hodgkin was born on 21 April 1877 in a very affluent Quaker family of [[Darlington]] in [[County Durham]], [[North East England]].&lt;ref name=BMJ&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2368451/?page=1 British Medical Journal, 1 April 1933]&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Jonathan Backhouse Hodgkin (1843-1926), banker and mayor of Darlington, and of Mary Anna Pease, both from [[Quaker]] families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancestry.co.uk/genealogy/records/jonathan-backhouse-hodgkin_37048073 Genealogic site ancestry.co.uk, last accessed on 14/12/2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Hodgkins lived in the majestic Victorian manor of Elm Ridge in  Darlington.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmridgemethodist.co.uk/history.html Elm Ridge manor (now belonging to the [[Methodist Church]]) history page, last accessed on 15/12/2015.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912030904/http://www.elmridgemethodist.co.uk/history.html |date=2012-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After [[Leighton Park School]] he studied first in [[King's College (Cambridge)|King's College, Cambridge]], then in [[St Thomas' Hospital]], London, to become a [[medical doctor]] (M.B. B.Ch (Cantab) ).&lt;ref name=BMJ/&gt; Extremely tall, with exceptional charisma and personality,&lt;ref name=DDA&gt;Dave D’Albert, A Lexicon of Spiritual Leaders In the IFOR Peace Movement, Part 1, Version 3, 2010 [https://www.ifor.org/s/spiritual-leaders-of-ifor.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; he became President of the English Student Missionary Union from 1902 to 1905. This organization's aim was to recruit missionaries among British students.&lt;ref name=BDCM&gt;Ralph R.

===Missionary work in China===
After completing his studies in 1905, Henry Hodgkin left immediately for [[Chengdu]], in the [[Sichuan]] province, [[China]], as a missionary The Friends' Foreign Missionary Association, a Quaker organisation which later became The Friends Service Council ; he stayed in China until 1909. During his stay in Chnegdu, he helped set up the [[West China Union University]], a Protestant university sponsored by several Protestant churches until its closure in 1926; after 1926 the Chinese professors took over from the foreign professors, and perpetuated their work so well that this university has now been incorporated into Chengdu's various universities.

From 1910 to 1920, Henry Hodgkin returned to England, to be the Secretary of The Friends' Foreign Missionary Association. He departed again for China in 1921, initially to deliver a series of lectures. He received however as a result a pressing invitation to become one of the secretaries of the [[National Christian Council of China]]; he held this position from 1922 to 1929.&lt;ref name=BMJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=BDCM/&gt;

===Launching of the [[International Fellowship of Reconciliation]]===
During his decade in Britain from 1910 to 1920, Hodgkin became active on the [[pacifist]] scene. In the summer of 1914, he had joined a group of about 150 European Christians who were convinced that a major conflagration was coming soon in Europe and who had gathered in [[Constance]], in southern Germany, to envisage possible actions to avert an actual war. This conference was far from successful since it was interrupted by the actual declaration of war! While conference participants were hurriedly returning home by train, Henry Hodgkin and the [[Germany|German]] [[Lutheran]] [[pastor]] [[Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze]] made a mutual commitment before parting in [[Cologne]] that while their countries might be at war with each other, "We are one in Christ and can never be at war." This commitment implied of course to abstain from any direct personal participation in the conflict, in line with the traditional pacifist Quaker position, but also to work relentlessly to reestablish peace between their two nations no matter the policies of their governments.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Kupisch, Die deutschen Landes Kirchen im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert, Publisher: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1975, 127 pages, quoting p. 93: "Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze was a pioneer of ecumenism. On 1 August 1914, he was present at the conference of the "Council of Churches of the British and German empires for the promotion of friendly relations between the two peoples" as he was the secretary of this organization. Unfortunately the beginning of the war put an end to the debates even before they could start. With great difficulty, and working his way through them thanks to his good relations with the German imperial court as former pastor of the [[Church of Peace (Sanssouci)|Friedenskirche Potsdam]], Siegmund-Schultze managed to secure the return of the 130 British participants by organising a special train to the Netherlands via [[Cologne]]. " It is on one of the platforms of the [[Köln Hauptbahnhof|Cologne Central Station]] that, on 3 August 1914, the famous embrace between Henry Hodgkin Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze took place during which they mutually promised to remain united in Christ in spite of war and to proclaim the message of peace of the Gospel whatever the circumstances."&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hodgkin kept his word immediately and initiated a first meeting at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], where he lectured in philosophy: an ecumenical group of about 20 people came together to reflect on the implications of war on their personal and community life. They wrote a common declaration stating they could conceive God as a [[nationalist]] and couldn’t accept the idea of a moratorium on the [[Sermon on the Mount]] on hold for the duration of the war.  The first chapter of the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR) was born. Another meeting gathered 128 people at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where Henry Hodgkin was elected president of the FOR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forusa.org/blogs/ifor/ifor-centennial-invitation/12896 US site of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation, last accessed on 14/12/2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222111715/http://forusa.org/blogs/ifor/ifor-centennial-invitation/12896 |date=2015-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1915 Hodgkin travelled to New York City with a group of 66 people and convened a meeting at [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]] that included some very influential theologians and ministers the day, including [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] (who would become critical of Christian pacifism in the ’30s and consequently break with the FOR). Among those present that day were [[Edward Evans (divine)|Edward Evans]], [[Norman Thomas]], socialist educator [[Jessie Wallace Hughan]] (who would later found the more secular [[War Resisters League]]), [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] [[Paul Jones (bishop)|bishop Paul Jones]] (who would be forced to resign his Utah see in April 1918 because of his outspoken opposition to World War I), [[Grace Hutchins]] et [[John Haynes Holmes]]. The American chapter of the now [[International Fellowship of Reconciliation]] was then founded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://levellers.wordpress.com/2009/11/08/a-brief-history-of-the-fellowship-of-reconciliation/ « Levellers » site, last accessed on 14/12/2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in the United States===
In 1929 Henry Hodgkin was called to launch the Quaker [[Pendle Hill Quaker Center for Study and Contemplation|religious and social meeting centre of Pendle Hill]] near [[Philadelphia]] ( [[Pendle Hill]] being the name of the [[Lancashire]] hill where [[George Fox]], the inspirator of [[Quakerism]], had his founding vision).&lt;ref name=BMJ/&gt; Historian Douglas Gwyn has shown Henry Hodgkin’s determining role, contributing his spiritual depth and his social concern to the drafting of the meeting centre’s vision:&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Gwyn, Personality and Place: The Life and Times of Pendle Hill, Plain Press, 2014. 512 pages.  {{ISBN|9781500549367}} [http://www.friendsjournal.org/personality-and-place-the-life-and-times-of-pendle-hill/  Review by Valerie Brown in The Friends’ Journal, 1 November 2015, last accessed on 14/12/2105]&lt;/ref&gt; Pendle Hill’s early vision was to be "a vital center of spiritual culture and as a place for training leaders." In 1929, Henry Hodgkin gathered a dozen leaders to discern the direction for this new center and four key focus areas were chosen as a result:
*House of Rest, a place of peace and deep quiet;
*School of the Prophets, a place to be grounded in a few well-chosen areas rather than teaching on many interesting topics;
*Laboratory of Ideas, a place to test beliefs in practice; and
*Fellowship ’Round Christ among students and staff.
He had to leave this position in 1932 for health reasons.&lt;ref name=BMJ/&gt;

==Books==
Henry  Hodgkin wrote several books, among which: 
*The Message and Mission of Quakerism (1912) (with [[William Charles Braithwaite]] (1862 – 1922))
*Friends beyond the Seas (1916)&lt;ref&gt;Publisher Headley Bros., London, 1916&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Missionary Spirit - Swarthmore Lecture for 1916&lt;ref&gt;Publisher Headley Bros., London, 1916&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Christian Revolution (1923)
*Living Issues in China (1932)

==Philosophy==
Henry Hodgkin’s philosophy was rooted in his Quaker faith, which brought along a deep adhesion to [[pacifism]] and in a high social sensitivity. His views evolved from a strict English Quaker missionary’s view to a more multicultural approach. One of his biographers wrote that he was "a man large of body and mind".&lt;ref name=DDA/&gt; He summarised his own evolution as follows: "By processes too numerous and diverse even to summarize, I have reached a position which may be stated in a general way somewhat like this: "I believe that God's best for another may be so different from my experience and way of living as to be actually impossible for me. I recognize a change to have taken place in myself, from a certain assumption that mine was really the better way, to a very complete recognition that there is no one better way and that God needs all kinds of people and ways of living through which to manifest Himself in the World. This has seemed to carry with it two conclusions which greatly affect conduct. One is that I really find myself wanting to learn from people whom I previously would have regarded as fit objects for my 'missionary zeal'. To discover another way in which God is operating - along lines it may be distasteful or dangerous to me - is a large part of the fun of living. The second direction in which conduct is influenced is the deliberate attempt to share the life and interests of others who are not in my circle ... [for] in such sharing I can most deeply understand the other's life and through that reach, maybe, fresh truths about God.&lt;ref name=DDA/&gt;"

==Family==
Henry Hodgkin married Elizabeth Joy Montgomery. They had three children. He died on 26 March 1933 in [[Dublin]] a few weeks after undergoing surgery. 
His family counted a variety of personalities who deeply influenced the region of [[Darlington]]:
*As a banker, his father had financed a fair share of the region’s  industrial development. 
*His father-in-law, John Pease was the oldest son of railway pioneer [[Edward Pease (railway pioneer)|Edward Pease]], and another affluent Quaker industrialist who had the Elm Ridge manor built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmridgemethodist.co.uk/history.html Page historique sur Elm Ridge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912030904/http://www.elmridgemethodist.co.uk/history.html |date=2012-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*His brother Jonathan Edward Hodgkin (1875-1953) was a devoted humanitarian during World War I, heading the local branch of The Friends War Victims Relief Committee - FWVRC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quaker.org.uk/about-quakers/our-history/quakers-and-wwi Historical page about the Quakers, last accessed on 15/12/2015]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1916 on he served in [[Durham, England|Durham]] as a Quaker chaplain to the imprisoned conscientious objectors and organised transport for wounded in Darlington district. He also became treasurer of the [[Peace Society|London Peace Society]].&lt;ref&gt;"Conscription and Conscience: A History, 1916-1919″, quoted by [http://www.durhamatwar.org.uk/story/11343/  Historical of Durham city]&lt;/ref&gt;
*His sister Mary Hodgkin (1882-1956) was the secretary of Darlington Town Mission for many years. She raised the needed money to build the Chapel at the Darlington Memorial Hospital for the use of the patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboutdarlington.co.uk/friends_burial_ground.htm Her grave can be seen in Darlington Quaker cemetery.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IMFI''' is an acronym for '''I'''nitial, '''M'''edial, '''F'''inal, '''I'''solated, a [[writing system]] in which each character has four different potential shapes:

* ''initial'' - used for the first character in a word
* ''medial'' - used in the middle of a word
* ''final'' - used for the last character in a word
* ''isolated'' - used for single-letter words

The [[Arabic]] and [[Syriac script]] is an example of an IMFI writing system.

{{Politics}}

In [[political science]], an '''initiative''' (also known as a '''popular''' or '''citizens' initiative''') is a means by which a [[petition]] signed by a certain minimum number of [[Voter registration|registered voters]] can force a public vote ([[referendum]], sometimes called a plebiscite).

The initiative may take the form of a '''direct initiative''' or an '''indirect initiative'''. In a direct initiative, a measure is put directly to a vote after being submitted by a petition. In an indirect initiative, a measure is first referred to the [[legislature]], and then put to a popular vote only if not enacted by the legislature.

The vote may be on a proposed [[statute]], [[constitutional amendment]], charter amendment or [[local ordinance]], or to simply oblige the [[executive (government)|executive]] or legislature to consider the subject by submitting it to the order of the day. It is a form of [[direct democracy]].

== Canada ==

=== British Columbia ===
The Canadian province of British Columbia has a citizen initiative law known as the Recall and Initiative Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/96398_00 |title=Table of Contents - Recall and Initiative Act |publisher=Bclaws.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original proposal was [[British Columbia recall and initiative referendum, 1991|put to voters in a referendum]] held in October 1991 and was supported by over 83% of voters. It was subsequently put into force by the incoming NDP government. Since it came into force in 1995, several attempts have been made to hold an initiative, but until the fall of 2010, none had succeeded in reaching the first of the thresholds, securing signatures of 10% of registered voters in each riding throughout British Columbia. The first referendum was held under this legislation on September 2011 on the subject of repealing the [[Harmonized Sales Tax]]. Details of its use in BC are available on the Elections BC website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.bc.ca/index.php/referenda-recall-initiative/initiative/ |title=Initiative &amp;#124; Elections BC |publisher=Elections.bc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== European Union ==

{{main|European Citizens' Initiative}}
The rejected [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe#Parliamentary power and transparency|Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]] (TCE) included a limited indirect initiative right (Article I-46(4)). The proposal of introducing the [[European Citizens' Initiative]] (ECI) was that 1,000,000 citizens, from minimal numbers of different member states, could invite the executive body of the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[European Commission]], to consider any proposal "on matters where citizens consider that a legal act of the Union is required for the purpose of implementing the Constitution." The precise mechanism had not been agreed upon. Critics underlined the weakness of this right of initiative, which did not ultimately entail any vote or referendum.

A similar scheme under the same name, European Citizens' Initiative (ECI), has been put forward in the now ratified European [[Lisbon Treaty]] (which entered into force on 1 December 2009), enabling a limited indirect initiative right.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120708193731/http://bookshop.europa.eu/eubookshop/download.action?fileName=NA7809931ENC_002.pdf&amp;eubphfUid=10740063&amp;catalogNbr=NA-78-09-931-EN-C ]&lt;/ref&gt; It follows very similar rules to the ones outlined in the European Constitution, requiring the signatures of 1,000 000 European Nationals. These citizens would thereby obtain the same right to request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal as the Council has had since the establishment of the [[European Communities]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=cs - čeština |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2009-0389+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN |title=Texts adopted - Thursday, 7 May 2009 - Implementation of the citizens' initiative - P6_TA-PROV(2009)0389 |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, does require that the signatures come from a "significant number" of Member States. It is suggested that this significant number will need to be around a quarter of member states, with at least 1/500 of the citizens in those member states supporting the initiative. With the variety of languages within the European Union, this creates a significant hurdle for people to navigate. The treaty also makes it clear that right of initiative should not be confused with the right to [[petition]], particularly since a petition is directed to Parliament&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=49&amp;pageRank=3&amp;language=en |title=Parliament : Petitions |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date=2000-12-18 |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a citizens' initiative is directed to the Commission; whereas a petition is a method of remonstrance, usually focussing on perceived infringements of European Law, an initiative is a grassroots proposal for new legislation. In 2013 the subjects of ongoing open initiatives of the European Citizens' Initiative are e.g. about "water and sanitation as a human right" (against [[Water privatization]]), "30 km/h - making the streets liveable!" ([[Traffic calming]] in towns), "[[Basic Income#Basic Income Movement in Europe|Unconditional Basic Income]]" (UBI - Exploring a pathway towards emancipatory welfare conditions), or to "End [[Ecocide]] in Europe" (to give the Earth Rights).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/initiatives/ongoing?lg=en ''Open initiatives''] at the European Citizens' Initiative official register of The European Commission (often translated in EU-languages). Retrieved 2013-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

It remains to be seen if the ECI evolves into a full initiative or remains in its present state of a ''de facto'' petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/secretariat_general/citizens_initiative/ |title=European Citizens' Initiative on the European Commission's web |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Citizens' Initiative on the initiator's web:&lt;br&gt;[http://www.citizens-initiative.eu/ citizens-initiative.eu]&lt;br&gt;[http://www.democracy-international.org/eci.html democracy-international.org/eci.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland ===

Since March 1, 2012, groups of at least 50,000&amp;nbsp;[[Finland|Finnish]] citizens with [[suffrage]] have had the constitutional right to send a citizens' initiative (Finnish: ''kansalaisaloite'', Swedish: ''medborgarinitiativ'') to the [[Parliament of Finland]].&lt;ref name="finland-citizens-initiative"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kansalaisaloite.fi/fi/tietoa/briefly-in-english|title=Citizens' initiatives in Finland|publisher=Ministry of Justice of Finland|accessdate=2013-03-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602052612/https://www.kansalaisaloite.fi/fi/tietoa/briefly-in-english|archivedate=2013-06-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="finland-constitution"&gt;Note: the text is an unofficial translation used by the Ministry of Justice of Finland.

=== France ===

A limited, indirect form of local initiative was added to the [[French Constitution]] (article 72-1, ''référendum d'initiative locale'') on 28 March 2003 as part of [[decentralization]] reforms. However, the only power these "local referendum initiatives" confer on citizens is the ability to add propositions to their local assembly's meeting agenda. The decision as to whether to submit citizen propositions to a popular vote (referendum) rests with the local assembly.

=== Germany ===

All German states have the right to initiative.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} However, there is no constitutional citizens' initiative in Germany at a federal level.

===Ireland===
The [[Constitution of Ireland]], since its [[enactment of the Constitution of Ireland|1937 enactment]], has never made provision for initiatives.&lt;ref name="constconv_5_3_2"/&gt; Since 2012, the [[Oireachtas]] (parliament) has a  [[joint committee]] to which the public can submit [[petition]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/public-petition-oireachtas-594866-Sep2012/|title=How does the new public petitions system work?|last=Barry|first=Aoife|date=14 September 2012|work=[[TheJournal.ie]]|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the committee must formally consider them but need not accept them.&lt;ref name="dail2015042100056"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015042100056#WRD00800|title=Written Answer No.225: Constitutional Convention Recommendations|date=21 April 2015|work=Dáil Éireann debates|publisher=Oireachtas|page=56|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/oireachtasbusiness/committees_list/about/31stdail/psop-committee/jointsub-committeeonpublicpetitions/|title=Joint Committee on Public Petitions|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/public_petitions.html|title=Public petitions|date=10 October 2016|publisher=Citizens Information Board|accessdate=19 December 2016|location=Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May–June 2013, when the [[Constitutional Convention (Ireland)|Constitutional Convention]] considered Dáil electoral reform, members voted 83:16 in favour of allowing "citizens' initiatives" in general,&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Convention 2013; §2 Question 9&lt;/ref&gt; 80:19 to allow them specifically for legislation,&lt;ref name="citzconvq10"&gt;Constitutional Convention 2013; §2 Question 10&lt;/ref&gt; and 78:17 to allow them for [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|constitutional amendment]]s.&lt;ref name="citzconvq10"/&gt; In April 2015, the [[Government of the 31st Dáil|Fine Gael–Labour government]] rejected the recommendations on the basis that there is sufficient public involvement in legislation through the petitions committee and the [[pre-legislative scrutiny]] process.&lt;ref name="dail2015042100056"/&gt;

Article 48 of the 1922 [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] gave a right of initiative: if more than 50,000 voters demanded a change in law, the Oireachtas had two years to enact it, failing which 75,000 voters could petition for a [[referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1922/act/1/schedule/1/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) Act, 1922, Schedule 1|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Article 48 |nopp=Y|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="constconv_5_3_2"&gt;Constitutional Convention 2013; §5.3.2 "Background"&lt;/ref&gt; The only attempt to invoke this was organised in 1927 by [[Fianna Fáil]], the largest [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] party, which sought to abolish the [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]]. By May 1928 Fianna Fáil claimed 96,000 signatures and attempted to have the petition [[Laying before the house|laid before]] the [[Dáil Éireann (Irish Free State)|Dáil]] (lower house). The motion was deferred, ostensibly to allow the Dáil [[Parliamentary procedure|procedure]] committee to define the method of dealing with such petitions.&lt;ref&gt;

===Romania===
According to Article 74 of the Romanian Constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_1&amp;par1=3#t3c1s3sba74|title=CONSTITUTIA ROMANIEI|pages=Article 74|date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, groups of at least 100,000 Romanian Citizens with suffrage that reside in at least one quarter of all the counties and with a minimum 5,000 signatures per county have the right to send a Citizens' Initiative which must be considered by the legislative body (Initiatives that address fiscal or international matters are not covered by this right).  If the initiative concerns changing the Constitution, Article 150 of the Constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_1&amp;par1=7#t7c0s0sba150|title=CONSTITUTIA ROMANIEI|pages=Article 150|date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that the group must include at least 500,000 Romanian Citizens with suffrage who reside in at least half of all the counties, with a minimum of 20,000 per county. Article 151 of the Constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_1&amp;par1=7#t7c0s0sba151|title=CONSTITUTIA ROMANIEI|pages=Article 151|date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; also states that any amendments brought to it, must be also approved by means of a National Referendum.

==New Zealand==
In [[New Zealand]] a vote initiated by the public is called a [[Referendums in New Zealand#Citizens initiated referendums|citizen initiated referendum]].  These are non-binding referendums on any issue in which proponents have submitted a petition to Parliament signed by ten percent of all registered electors within 12 months.

== Philippines ==
{{main|People's Initiative}}
People's initiative to propose amendments to the constitution is enshrined in the 1987 Philippine Constitution under Article XVII Section 2, which states:

{{quote|Amendments to this Constitution may likewise be directly proposed by the people through initiative upon a petition of at least twelve per centum of the total number of registered voters, of which every legislative district must be represented by at least three per centum of the registered voters therein. No amendment under this section shall be authorized within five years following the ratification of this Constitution nor oftener than once every five years thereafter.}}

This provision is further protected by Republic Act 6735 or ''The Initiative and Referendum Act.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joselito Guianan Chan, Managing Partner, Chan Robles &amp;amp; Associates Law Firm |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno6735.htm |title=Philippine Laws, Statutes And Codes - Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |publisher=Chanrobles.com |date=1989-08-04 |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law defines initiative as:
# A petition to propose amendments to the constitution.
# A petition to propose enactment of national legislation.
# A petition to propose enactment of local resolution or ordinance on regional, provincial, city, municipal, or barangay level.

The law also provides ''indirect initiative'' defining the exercise of people's initiative through a proposition sent to congress or local legislative body for action.

== Switzerland ==
{{Main|Popular initiative (Switzerland)}}

The [[federal popular initiative]] was included in the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] in 1891, permitting a certain number of citizens (currently 100,000 signatures within 18 months&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bk.admin.ch/themen/pore/vi/index.html?lang=de ''Eidgenössische Volksinitiative''], website of "The Federal Authorities of the Swiss Confederation" (German, possible to switch to French or Italien language). Retrieved 2013-09-04.&lt;/ref&gt;) to make a request to amend a constitutional article, or even to introduce a new article into the constitution. The right of initiative is also used at the cantonal and communal level in Switzerland (all [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]]s, all [[Communes of Switzerland|commune]]s where the [[direct democracy|direct democratic]] citizens' participation originates); many cantons allow initiatives to enact regular non-constitutional law, but the federal system does not.

If the necessary number of supporters is reached, the initiative will be put to a [[plebiscite]] about two or three years later; the delay helps prevent short-term political moods from getting into the constitution. The parliament and government will both issue their official opinions on whether they recommend voting for or against the proposed amendment, and these opinions will be published.

The parliament may also pass an alternative amendment suggestion which will also be included on the ballot; in this case, the voters cast two votes, one for whether or not they want an amendment, and one for which one they want, the original one from the initiative or the one introduced in parliament, in case a majority decides for amending.

A citizen-proposed change to the constitution in Switzerland at the national level needs to achieve both a majority of the national popular vote and a majority of the canton-wide vote  to pass. The vast majority of national initiatives introduced since 1891, when the system started, have failed to receive voter support. But the initiatives have proven to be a useful tool to force the government to concentrate on subjects that will otherwise remain hidden from the politic, lowering the distance between the government and the citizens.

==United States ==
{{Main|Initiatives and referendums in the United States}}
{{cn span|In the [[United States]], a popular vote on a measure is referred to as a [[referendum]] only when originating with the [[legislature]]. An initiative may be called a "[[ballot measure]]", "initiative measure", or "proposition".|date=May 2013}}

The United States has no initiative process at the national level, but the initiative is in use at the level of state government in 24 states and the [[Initiatives and referendums in the District of Columbia|District of Columbia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iandrinstitute.org/statewide_i%26r.htm |title=State by state listing of where initiatives and referendums are used |publisher=Iandrinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211180917/http://www.iandrinstitute.org/statewide_i%26r.htm |archivedate=2016-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also in common use at the local government level.

[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I, Section I]] of the [[United States Constitution]] [[Vesting Clause|vests]] "all legislative powers herein granted" to the [[United States Congress|Congress of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;United States Constitution, Article I, Section I&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing a national initiative procedure would likely require an [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amendment to the Constitution]], which would under [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]] require two-thirds of both houses of Congress or the application of two-thirds of the [[state legislatures]] to propose, and three-fourths of all state legislatures (or conventions in three-fourths of the [[U.S. state|states]]) to ratify. The Constitution itself, pursuant to [[Article VII of the United States Constitution|Article VII]], was ratified by state conventions rather than by a referendum.

Several proposals have been made to institute a national referendum. The [[Ludlow Amendment]], introduced several times to the [[US House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by [[Louis Ludlow]], of [[Indiana]], between 1935 and 1940, proposed an amendment to the Constitution that would require a national referendum to [[declare war]] except in the case of invasion or attack. The amendment came closest to overcoming a [[discharge petition]] on January 10, 1938, when it was defeated in the House by a vote of 209 to 188. That was short of the two-thirds vote required for its passage.

Unsuccessful attempts to get initiatives have nevertheless occurred, but since the proposals were bills, not a constitutional amendments, no initiative could probably have lawfully been voted on notwithstanding the bills' passage. The first attempt to get national ballot initiatives occurred in 1907 when House Joint Resolution 44 was introduced by Rep. [[Elmer Fulton]] of [[Oklahoma]]; the proposal was never put to a vote. In 1977, both the Abourezk-Hatfield National Voter Initiative and the Jagt Resolutions never got out of committee. [[Senator Mike Gravel]] was part of that effort.

The modern system of [[Initiatives and referendums in the United States|initiative and referendum]] originated in the state of [[South Dakota]], which adopted initiative and referendum in 1898 by a popular vote of 23,816 to 16,483. [[Oregon]] was the second state to adopt and did so in 1902, when the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] adopted it by an overwhelming majority. The "Oregon System," as it was at first known, subsequently spread to many other states, and became one of the signature reforms of the [[Progressive Era]] (1890s-1920s).

==Brazil ==

On Brazil, a popular law initiative requires two conditions to be send to analysis by the national congress: signatures from at least 1% of the people allowed to vote from all the country and at least 0,3% of the people allowed to vote from each of at least 5 of the 27 federal unities (the 26 states plus the federal district). If both conditions are achivied, then the congress is obliged to discus and vote the initiative.

[[File:Airline position.svg|thumb|The 'Jetliner Position' or 'The Chair' is a [[Stress position|Stress Position]] used for [[torture]] or punishment.]]
The '''jetliner position''', also known as the '''captain's chair''', is a form of [[torture|physical torment]] used in cases where the tormentor is unable or unwilling to inflict [[corporal punishment]] on the subject.  The recipient is made to put his back against a wall or pole and place their feet eighteen inches or so from the base of the object.  The feet are usually kept close together.  The subject must then slide down the wall or pole until his [[thigh]]s are parallel to the ground, so that his profile is of someone sitting in a [[chair]].  He may also be required to slide his feet back until his [[shinbone|shin]]s and thighs are at right-angles to each other, which makes the stresses upon the [[knee]] joints and thigh muscles much greater.

Variations include placing weight on the subject's head or thighs, or making him hold his arms straight out in front of him, perhaps with a weight clasped in his hands.  The result is increasing amounts of pain in the thigh muscles, as well as pain in the knees and ankles.  The benefit for the perpetrator is that this kind of punishment causes pain without any lasting marks or, under all but the most extreme conditions, lasting damage to the subjects.

It was a very common form of torture and humiliation during China's [[Cultural Revolution]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In India this method of punishment is often referred to as the chair and was or is used in correcting juvenile delinquents. Also in other countries it was a commonly used punishment.

'''Joan Robinson''' in her book '''The Accumulation of Capital'''&lt;ref&gt;Joan Robinson, ''The Accumulation of Capital'' (London: Macmillan &amp; Co. Ltd., 1956)&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1956, propagated a simple growth model, which reflects the working of a pure capitalist economy, also known as the "Joan Robinson's Growth Model". However, the Accumulation of Capital was a terse book and in one of her other books entitled '''Essays in the theory of Economic Growth''',&lt;ref&gt;Joan Robinson, ''Essays in the Theory of Economic Growth'' (London: Macmillan &amp; Co. Ltd., 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D. |last=Hamberg |year=1963 |title=''Essays in the Theory of Economic Growth'' by Joan Robinson |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=53 |issue=5 |pages=1109–1114 |jstor= }}&lt;/ref&gt; she tried to lower the degree of abstraction. The growth model was propagated in verbal terms, where later on the mathematical formalization was put forward by [[Kenneth K. Kurihara]].

'''Assumptions''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=S. K. |last=Mishra |first2=V. K. |last2=Puri |title=Economics of Development and Planning |isbn=978-81-8488-829-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# There is a [[laissez-faire]] [[closed economy]].
# The factors of production are capital and labour only.
# There is neutral technical progress.
# There are only two classes: workers and entrepreneurs among whom the national income is distributed.
# Workers save nothing and spend their wage income on consumption.
# Entrepreneurs consume nothing, but save and invest their entire income for [[capital formation]].
# There is no change in the price level.
# Saving is a function of profit.

==The Model==
The entrepreneurs total profit and the workers total wage bill constitute the Net National Income in Joan Robinson's Growth Model. It can be mathematically expressed as&lt;br /&gt;
'''pY=wN+πpK'''&lt;br /&gt;
where '''Y''' is the net national income, '''w''' is the money wage rate, '''N''' the number of workers employed, '''K''' is the amount of capital utilized, '''p''' is the average price of output as well as of capital and '''π''' is the gross profit rate (including the rate).

To be [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] was a penalty in England and the [[United Kingdom]] for several crimes, but mainly for [[high treason]]. This method was abolished in England in 1870.

In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the '''lived body''' is your own body as [[experience]]d by yourself, ''as'' yourself.&lt;ref&gt;http://hss.fullerton.edu/sociology/orleans/phenomenology.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phenomenologyonline.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Your own body manifests itself to you mainly as your possibilities of acting in the world. It is what lets you reach out and grab something, for instance, but it also, and more importantly, allows for the possibility of changing your point of view. This helps you differentiate one thing from another by the experience of moving around it, seeing new aspects of it (often referred to as making the absent present and the present absent), and still retaining the notion that this is the same thing that you saw other aspects of just a moment ago (it is identical). Your body is also experienced as a duality, both as object (you can touch your own hand) and as your own subjectivity (you are being touched).

[[Empathy]] refers to the experience of another human body as another subjectivity: In one sense, you see another body, but what you immediately perceive or experience is another subject. In Husserl's original account, this was done by a sort of [[apperception]] built on the experiences of your own lived-body.

The experience of your own body as your own subjectivity is then applied to the experience of another's body, which, through apperception, is constituted as another subjectivity. You can thus recognise the Other's intentions, emotions, etc. This experience of empathy is important in the phenomenological account of [[intersubjectivity]]. In phenomenology, intersubjectivity is what constitutes objectivity (i.e., what you experience as objective is experienced as being intersubjectively available - available to all other subjects. This does not imply that objectivity is reduced to subjectivity nor does it imply a relativist position, cf. for instance [[intersubjective verifiability]]).

In the experience of intersubjectivity, one also experiences oneself as being a subject among other subjects, and one experiences oneself as existing objectively ''for'' these [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]s; one experiences oneself as the [[noema]] of Others' noeses, or as a subject in another's empathic experience. As such, one experiences oneself as objectively existing subjectivity. Intersubjectivity is also a part in the constitution of one's lifeworld, especially as "homeworld."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7386">In [[logic]], a '''logical framework''' provides a means to define (or present) a logic as a signature in a higher-order [[type theory]] in such a way that [[Provability logic|provability]] of a formula in the original logic reduces to a [[type inhabitation]] problem in the framework type theory.&lt;ref name="Jacobs2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bart Jacobs|title=Categorical Logic and Type Theory|year=2001|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-50853-9|page=598}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gabbay1994"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Dov M.

The first logical framework was [[Automath]]; however, the name of the idea comes from the more widely known Edinburgh Logical Framework, '''LF'''. Several more recent proof tools like [[Isabelle (theorem prover)|Isabelle]] are based on this idea.&lt;ref name="Jacobs2001"/&gt; Unlike a direct embedding, the logical framework approach allows many logics to be embedded in the same type system.&lt;ref name="BoveBarbosa2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ana Bove|author2=Luis Soares Barbosa|author3=Alberto Pardo|title=Language Engineering and Rigourous (sic) Software Development: International LerNet ALFA Summer School 2008, Piriapolis, Uruguay, February 24 - March 1, 2008, Revised, Selected Papers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YOqHiA5MYpEC&amp;pg=PA48|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-03152-6|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
A logical framework is based on a general treatment of syntax, rules and proofs by means of a [[dependent type theory|dependently typed lambda calculus]]. Syntax is treated in a style similar to, but more general than [[Per Martin-Löf]]'s system of arities.

To describe a logical framework, one must provide the following:

# A characterization of the class of object-logics to be represented;
# An appropriate meta-language;
# A characterization of the mechanism by which object-logics are represented.

This is summarized by:

:"''Framework = Language + Representation''."

==LF==
In the case of the '''LF logical framework''', the meta-language is the [[λΠ-calculus]]. This is a system of first-order dependent function types which are related by the [[propositions as types principle]] to [[first-order logic|first-order]] [[minimal logic]]. The key features of the λΠ-calculus are that it consists of entities of three levels: objects, types and kinds (or type classes, or families of types). It is [[Impredicativity|predicative]], all well-typed terms are [[strongly normalizing]] and [[Church-Rosser]] and the property of being well-typed is [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]]. However, [[type inference]] is undecidable.

A logic is represented in the '''LF logical framework''' by the judgements-as-types representation mechanism. This is inspired by [[Per Martin-Löf]]'s development of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s notion of [[judgement (mathematical logic)|judgement]], in the 1983 Siena Lectures. The two higher-order judgements, the hypothetical &lt;math&gt;J\vdash K&lt;/math&gt; and the general, &lt;math&gt;\Lambda x\in J. K(x)&lt;/math&gt;, correspond to the ordinary and dependent function space, respectively. The methodology of judgements-as-types is that judgements are represented as the types of their proofs. A [[logical system]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal L}&lt;/math&gt; is represented by its signature which assigns kinds and types to a finite set of constants that represents its syntax, its judgements and its rule schemes. An object-logic's rules and proofs are seen as primitive proofs of hypothetico-general judgements &lt;math&gt;\Lambda x\in C. J(x)\vdash K&lt;/math&gt;.

An implementation of the LF logical framework is provided by the [[Twelf]] system at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. Twelf includes
* a logic programming engine
* meta-theoretic reasoning about logic programs (termination, coverage, etc.)
* an inductive [[meta-logic]]al theorem prover

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9641">In [[mathematical logic]], '''Löb's theorem''' states that in any formal system F with [[Peano arithmetic]] (PA), for any formula ''P'', if it is provable in F that "if ''P'' is provable in F then ''P'' is true", then ''P'' is provable in F. More formally, if ''Bew(#P)'' means that the formula ''P'' with [[Gödel number]] #''P'' is provable (from the [[German language|German]] "beweisbar"), then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{if}\ PA \vdash (Bew(\# P) \rightarrow P)\mathrm{, then}\ PA \vdash P,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{ PA \vdash Bew(\# P) \rightarrow P }{ PA \vdash P }.&lt;/math&gt;

An immediate corollary of Löb's theorem is that, if ''P'' is not provable in PA, then "if ''P'' is provable in PA, then ''P'' is true" is not provable in PA. For example, "If &lt;math&gt;1+1=3&lt;/math&gt; is provable in PA, then &lt;math&gt;1+1=3&lt;/math&gt;" is not provable in PA.

Löb's theorem is named for [[Martin Löb|Martin Hugo Löb]], who formulated it in 1955.

==Löb's theorem in provability logic==
[[Provability logic]] abstracts away from the details of encodings used in [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] by expressing the provability of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in the given system in the language of [[modal logic]], by means of the modality {{tooltip|&lt;math&gt;\Box \phi&lt;/math&gt;|The box is intended to be a box; it is not your browser failing to display another glyph.}}.

Then we can formalize Löb's theorem by the axiom

:&lt;math&gt;\Box(\Box P\rightarrow P)\rightarrow \Box P,&lt;/math&gt;

known as axiom GL, for Gödel-Löb. This is sometimes formalised by means of an inference rule that infers

:&lt;math&gt; P&lt;/math&gt;

from

:&lt;math&gt;\Box P\rightarrow P.&lt;/math&gt;

The provability logic GL that results from taking the [[modal logic]] ''K4'' (or ''K'', since the axiom schema '''4''', &lt;math&gt;\Box A\rightarrow\Box\Box A&lt;/math&gt;, then becomes redundant) and adding the above axiom GL is the most intensely investigated system in provability logic.

==Modal proof of Löb's theorem==
Löb's theorem can be proved within modal logic using only some basic rules about the provability operator (the K4 system) plus the existence of modal fixed points.

===Modal formulas===
We will assume the following grammar for formulas:
# If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[propositional variable]], then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a formula.
# If &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a propositional constant, then &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a formula.
# If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a formula, then &lt;math&gt;\Box A&lt;/math&gt; is a formula.
# If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are formulas, then so are &lt;math&gt;\neg A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A \wedge B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A \vee B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A \leftrightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;

A modal sentence is a modal formula that contains no propositional variables. We use &lt;math&gt;\vdash A&lt;/math&gt; to mean &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a theorem.

===Modal fixed points===
If &lt;math&gt;F(X)&lt;/math&gt; is a modal formula with only one propositional variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then a modal fixed point of &lt;math&gt;F(X)&lt;/math&gt; is a sentence &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\vdash \Psi \leftrightarrow F(\Box \Psi)&lt;/math&gt;

We will assume the existence of such fixed points for every modal formula with one free variable. This is of course not an obvious thing to assume, but if we interpret &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; as provability in Peano Arithmetic, then the existence of modal fixed points is in fact true.{{Citation needed|reason="This is of course not an obvious thing to assume..."|date=September 2016}}

===Modal rules of inference===
In addition to the existence of modal fixed points, we assume the following rules of inference for the provability operator &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;:

# '''(necessitation)''' From &lt;math&gt;\vdash A&lt;/math&gt; conclude &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box A&lt;/math&gt;: Informally, this says that if A is a theorem, then it is provable.
# '''(internal necessitation)''' &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box A \rightarrow \Box \Box A&lt;/math&gt;: If A is provable, then it is provable that it is provable.
# '''(box distributivity)''' &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box (A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow (\Box A \rightarrow \Box B)&lt;/math&gt;:  This rule allows you to do modus ponens inside the provability operator. If it is provable that A implies B, and A is provable, then B is provable.

===Proof of Löb's theorem===

# Assume that there is a modal sentence &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box P \rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Roughly speaking, it is a theorem that if &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is provable, then it is, in fact true.&lt;br&gt;This is a claim of ''soundness''.
# From the existence of modal fixed points for every formula (in particular, the formula &lt;math&gt;X \rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;) it follows there exists a sentence &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Psi \leftrightarrow (\Box \Psi \rightarrow P)&lt;/math&gt;.
# From 2, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Psi \rightarrow (\Box \Psi \rightarrow P)&lt;/math&gt;.
# From the necessitation rule, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box(\Psi \rightarrow (\Box \Psi \rightarrow P))&lt;/math&gt;.
# From 4 and the box distributivity rule, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box\Psi \rightarrow \Box(\Box \Psi \rightarrow P)&lt;/math&gt;.
# Applying the box distributivity rule with &lt;math&gt; A = \Box \Psi &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; B= P&lt;/math&gt; gives us &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box(\Box \Psi \rightarrow P) \rightarrow (\Box\Box\Psi \rightarrow \Box P)&lt;/math&gt;.
# From 5 and 6, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box \Psi \rightarrow (\Box\Box\Psi \rightarrow \Box P)&lt;/math&gt;.
# From the internal necessitation rule, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box \Psi \rightarrow \Box \Box \Psi&lt;/math&gt;.
# From 7 and 8, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box \Psi \rightarrow \Box P&lt;/math&gt;.
# From 1 and 9, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box \Psi \rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;.
# From 2, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash   (\Box \Psi \rightarrow P) \rightarrow \Psi&lt;/math&gt;. 
# From 10 and 11, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Psi&lt;/math&gt;
# From 12 and the necessitation rule, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box \Psi&lt;/math&gt;.
# From 13 and 10, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash P&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
An immediate corollary of Löb's theorem is that, if ''P'' is not provable in PA, then "if ''P'' is provable in PA, then ''P'' is true" is not provable in PA. Given we know PA is consistent (but PA does not know PA is consistent), here are some simple examples:
* "If &lt;math&gt;1+1=3&lt;/math&gt; is provable in PA, then &lt;math&gt;1+1=3&lt;/math&gt;" is not provable in PA, as &lt;math&gt;1+1=3&lt;/math&gt; is not provable in PA (as it is false).
* "If &lt;math&gt;1+1=2&lt;/math&gt; is provable in PA, then &lt;math&gt;1+1=2&lt;/math&gt;" is provable in PA, as is any statement of the form "If X, then &lt;math&gt;1+1=2&lt;/math&gt;".
* "If [[Paris–Harrington theorem#The strengthened finite Ramsey theorem|the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem]] is provable in PA, then the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is true" is not provable in PA, as "The strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is true" is not provable in PA (despite being true).

In [[Doxastic logic]], Löb's theorem shows that any system classified as a ''[[Doxastic logic#Types of reasoners|reflexive]]'' "[[Doxastic logic#Increasing levels of rationality|type 4]]" reasoner must also be "''modest''": such a reasoner can never believe "my belief in P would imply that P is true", without first believing that P is true.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Smullyan|Smullyan, Raymond M.]], (1986) [http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1029818&amp;type=pdf&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;CFID=44077077&amp;CFTOKEN=65318791 ''Logicians who reason about themselves''], Proceedings of the 1986 conference on Theoretical aspects of reasoning about knowledge, Monterey (CA), Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc., San Francisco (CA), pp. 341-352&lt;/ref&gt;

==Converse: Löb's theorem implies the existence of modal fixed points==
Not only does the existence of modal fixed points imply Löb's theorem, but the converse is valid, too.  When Löb's theorem is given as an axiom (schema), the existence of a fixed point (up to provable equivalence) &lt;math&gt;p\leftrightarrow A(p)&lt;/math&gt; for any formula ''A''(''p'')'' modalized in p'' can be derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10992-005-9013-8|date=June 2006|volume=35|issue=3|pages=225–230|title=Note on Some Fixed Point Constructions in Provability Logic|author=Per Lindström|doi=10.1007/s10992-005-9013-8|journal=Journal of Philosophical Logic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus in [[normal modal logic]], Löb's axiom is equivalent to the conjunction of the axiom schema '''4''', &lt;math&gt;(\Box A\rightarrow \Box\Box A,)&lt;/math&gt; and the existence of modal fixed points.

Besides demanding that Najib be removed from his position, the declaration signed by, among others, former Premier Mahathir and 57 other signatories also touched on freedom of speech and a free media.
The main points of the declaration were:
*The removal of Najib Razak as the prime minister of Malaysia through non-violent and legally permissible means;
*The removal of all those who have acted in concert with him;
*A repeal of all recent laws and agreements that violate the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution, and;
*A restoration of the integrity of the institutions that have been undermined, such as the police, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), Bank Negara and the Public Accounts Committee.

The declaration included several key reasons for the demands:
*Concern over the deteriorating political, economic and social situation in the country;
*Damage done to the country under the premiership of Najib Razak;
* Malaysia becoming one of the 10 most corrupt countries in the world, according to Ernst and Young in their Asia Pacific Fraud Survey Report Series 2013. The 2015 Corruption Perception Index showed Malaysia had dropped four places from 50 to 54; and,
* Allocations to all ministries and public institutions, including universities, have been reduced because of shortage of funds. Even when allocations are budgeted for, no money was available.

CITIZENS' DECLARATION

1.	We - the undersigned citizens of Malaysia append below our concern over the deteriorating political, economic and social situation in the country.

2.	We wish to draw the attention of the people of Malaysia to the damage done to the country under the Premiership of Dato' Sri Najib Tun Razak.

3.	Under his administration the country has descended to become one of the 10 most corrupt countries in the world according to Ernst and Young in their Asia Pacific Fraud Survey Report Series 2013. The 2015 Corruption Perception Index showed Malaysia has dropped four places from 50 to 54.

4.	This is because he believes that money can ensure his position as Prime Minister of Malaysia. He believes that "Cash is King".

5. Allocations to all ministries and public institutions including universities have been reduced because of shortages of funds. Even when allocations are budgeted for, no money was available.

6. In 2009 he decided to set up a Sovereign Wealth fund to earn income for the Government.

7. He created the 1 Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) which became indebted with RM42 billion of loans which it is unable to repay. It is no longer a Sovereign Wealth fund. It is a Sovereign Debt Fund.

8. 1MDB borrowed approximately RM20 billion to acquire three power plant companies for an over-priced RM12.1 billion. Despite being awarded new power plant contracts and extensions to the expiring power-producing concessions, the 1MDB power companies were sold for RM9.83 billion, or a loss of RM2.27 billion.
 
9. 1MDB invested or lent a total of US$1.83 billion to Petrosaudi International (PSI) Limited between 2009 and 2011 under the pretext of bogus projects or non-existent assets.  Bank Negara Malaysia had demanded 1MDB return the above money to Malaysia as their approval was given based on misinformation submitted by 1MDB.  Of this sum, a total of US$1.45 billion was directly and indirectly siphoned off to Good Star Limited and other companies controlled by Low Taek Jho. 
 
10. 	To hide the missing funds, 1MDB "disposed" its investments and loans to PSI for US$2.318 billion, claiming to have made a profit of US$488 million.  However, no money was returned to Malaysia.  Instead, 1MDB claimed it invested the funds in Cayman Islands that was subsequently found to be an unlicensed investment manager.  KPMG was sacked as 1MDB's auditors for refusing to confirm the value of the investment in the mysterious Caymans fund.
 
11.    1MDB claimed that the Cayman Islands investment has been fully redeemed.  US$1.22 billion was reportedly redeemed on 5 November 2014 but was substantially utilised on the very same day to compensate Aabar Investments PJS for the termination of options granted to Aabar to acquire 49% of 1MDB's power companies.  This is a lie because the parent of Aabar, International Petroleum Investment Corporation (IPIC) did not mention receipt of any such payments in its audited accounts published on the London Stock Exchange.  Instead the accounts stated that 1MDB owes IPIC the sum of US$481 million for the termination.
 
12. 1MDB also took another loan of US$975 million from a Deutsche Bank-led consortium in September 2014, for the very same purpose of compensating Aabar for the terminated options.  The Wall Street Journal has exposed the fact that these money have been paid to a different British Virgin Islands entity with a similar name, "Aabar Investment PJS Limited", whose beneficial owner is completely unrelated to IPIC.  The simple scam has fooled even the 1MDB auditors, Deloitte Malaysia into believing that the payments were indeed received by IPIC's Aabar.
 
13. 1MDB announced that it made a 2nd and final RM1.1 billion redemption of the Cayman Islands investment in January 2015.  Initially, the Prime Minister told Parliament that the sum was held in cash in BSI Bank, Singapore.  However, two months later in May 2015, he informed Parliament that it was not cash but "assets".  Subsequently, it was explained that these assets were "units" which meant that they were never redeemed in the first place.  This proved that 1MDB and the Prime Minister have been consistently lying to the Malaysian public.  It also means that the money invested in Petrosaudi which was reinvested in Cayman Islands, are still missing and unaccounted for.

14.	A former UMNO vice-head of the Batu Kawan Division made a police report on the loss of large sums of money by 1MDB. No investigations were carried out by the police. Instead he was interrogated by police, detained and charged under anti-terrorist law (SOSMA) for sabotage of the Malaysian economy. His lawyer was also arrested and charged under the same law. This has the effect of frightening people from making police reports on the 1MDB.

15.	The Wall Street Journal reported that Najib had US$681 million in his private account at Ambank.

16. 	Najib denied this at first but later admitted he had the huge amount of money in his account. He claimed that it was a gift from an Arab; then that it was a donation to help him win the 13th general election in Malaysia; then that it was given because of his dedication to the fight against Islamic terrorists. He then claimed to have received the money from a Saudi prince, then from the King of Saudi Arabia who had passed away.

17.	Later a Saudi Minister stated there was no record of such a gift by the Saudis. He suggested it was probably a Saudi investment. The amount was small.

18.	Najib expressed his intention to sue the Wall Street Journal. But he did not. Instead he asked his lawyer to ask the Wall Street Journal why it published the report.

19.	To this day the WSJ continues to report more and more details about the US$681 million he has in his private account. He has not sued WSJ, which he can do in the country the WSJ is published.

20. Concerned over the huge sum of money in Najib's private account a task force was set up in Malaysia to investigate the origin of the money. Four Government institutions became members of the task force. They are the Police, the Attorney General, Bank Negara and the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission.

21. Before the Task Force was able to finish its work, the Attorney General was removed by Najib claiming that he was sick and could not continue to work. Basically Najib had misrepresented to the King to get the Attorney General to be replaced.  The Public Accounts Committee was basically paralysed by Najib removing its chairman and members to prevent its investigation of the 1MDB. A new chairman, friendly to Najib was appointed and he promptly declared that Najib had done nothing wrong.

22. He then appointed a new Attorney General. Shortly thereafter the new Attorney General dismissed a recommendation by Bank Negara for action to be taken, claiming that nothing in the report showed Najib had done any wrong.

23.	Bank Negara appealed but this was brushed aside.

24.	The new Attorney General also dismissed another report by the MACC. The contents of the report are not revealed and threats are made against revealing its contents.

25. The new Attorney General has without valid explanations, dismissed the recommendations of the two institutions that possess the powers and expertise in their areas.
 
26. This dismissal prevented the matter from being determined by a court of law after all the evidence was evaluated. By doing so the Attorney General has acted as prosecutor and judge. Due process and the rule of law have been denied.

27. The sacked Deputy Prime Minister later revealed that the former Attorney General had shown him proof of Najib's wrongdoings relating to the scandals. At the same time, various foreign Government agencies, namely from Switzerland, Singapore, the United States, Hong Kong and Britain have initiated investigations on the 1MDB.

28.	The press in Malaysia is heavily censored so that Malaysians have to rely on the foreign press. Yet when Malaysians discuss or write about the foreign reports, the Government (Inspector General of Police) invited people to make police reports so that the police can carry out questioning and investigation against the person concerned.

29.	This is in contrast to the failure of the police to investigate the police report formally made against Najib, Jho Low and the reports to the Attorney General by Bank Negara and MACC. The Attorney General even threatens to amend the law to provide for jail for life with 10 strokes of the rotan against anyone "leaking" Government papers. This means that crimes committed in the administration can be hidden from the public.

30.	The Attorney General claims that a part of the 2.6 billion Ringgit (about 2.3 billion) has been returned to the donor or donors. Apart from this statement no proof has been provided.

31.	The people are suffering.

32.	Najib's GST and increases in toll rates have increased the cost of living, forcing some businesses to close down and also causing foreign-owned industries to stop operations and relocate to other countries, creating unemployment.

33.	Despite protests by the people Najib joined the US sponsored Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) which erodes our freedom to make policies and laws suitable for our country.

34.	Today Malaysia's image is badly tarnished. Apart from being classified as one of the 10 most corrupt countries, Malaysia is now regarded as undemocratic. There is denial of freedom of speech and freedom of the press and people live in fear of arrest and detentions. Security laws are enacted to allow the Prime Minister (and not the King) to declare security areas where anyone could be arrested and detained without trial and tried under procedures that violate normal and fair criminal justice standards.

35. On the other hand, where errors are made in applying these laws by Government officers, or where there is a blatant abuse of power, the people are unable to hold them accountable. Whistleblowers are harassed and punished instead of being protected. Other repressive laws are used to stifle free speech and legitimate comment about wrongdoings. The fundamental rights enshrined under the Federal Constitution have become meaningless.

36.	For all these reasons, we, the undersigned citizens of Malaysia agree and support:
a) The removal of Dato' Sri Najib Tun Razak as the Prime Minister of Malaysia through non-violent and legally permissible means;
b) The removal of all those who have acted in concert with him;
c) A repeal of all the recent laws and agreements that violate the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution and undermine policy choices and
d) A restoration of the integrity of the institutions that have been undermined, such as the police, the MACC, Bank Negara and the PAC.

37. 	We call upon all Malaysians, irrespective of race, religion, political affiliation, creed or parties, young and old to join us in saving Malaysia from the Government headed by Dato' Sri Najib Tun Razak, to pave the way for much needed democratic and institutional reforms, and to restore the important principle of the separation of powers among the executive, legislature and judiciary which will ensure the independence, credibility, professionalism and integrity of our national institutions.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1636">'''Material take off''' ('''MTO''') is a term used in [[engineering]] and [[construction]], and refers to a list of [[Raw material|material]]s with quantities and types (such as specific grades of [[steel]]) that are required to build a designed structure or item. This list is generated by analysis of a [[blueprint]] or other design document. The list of required materials for construction is sometimes referred to as the material take off list (MTOL).

Material take off is not limited to the amount of required material, but also the weight of the items taken off. This is important when dealing with larger structures, allowing the company that does the take off to determine total weight of the item and how best to move the item (if necessary) when construction is completed.

==Definition used by the ISA (International Society of Automation)==
A material take off (MTO) is the process of analyzing the drawings and determining all the materials required to accomplish the design. We then use the material take off to create a [[bill of materials]] (BOM). Inspection does not aid in creating a bill of materials. Procurement and requisition are activities that occur after the bill of materials is complete.

The final stages of the MTO is as instrumentally visible in the GAD (General Arrangement Drawing) for specific equipment. The MTO sheet is such an important document in projects as it presents a huge detail such as list of all Materials, quantities, weights, material types, material codes etc.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14682">[[File:EOE YBQYM 1887.jpg|thumb|right|[[Revivalism|Revivalist]] preacher [[Samuel Porter Jones|Sam Jones]] coined the slogan "Quit Your Meanness" which was put to music by [[E. O. Excell]].{{sfn|Parker|2005}}]]  
'''Meanness''' is a personal quality whose classical form, discussed by many from [[Aristotle]] to [[Thomas Aquinas]], characterizes it as a [[vice]] of "lowness", but whose modern form deals more with [[cruelty]].

== Classical formulation ==
In his dictionary, [[Noah Webster]] defined meanness as "want of excellence", "want of rank", "low estate", "lowness of mind", and "sordidness, niggardliness, opposed to liberality or charitableness" pointing out that "meanness is very different from frugality".{{sfn|Webster|1832}}  These, in particular the final one, largely summarize the aspects of the classical definition of meanness that have been propounded by philosophers, Aristotelian and otherwise, over the centuries.

=== Aristotle ===
In his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', where each virtue is considered as a midway point on a continuum bracketed by two vices, Aristotle places meanness as one of the two vices that bracket the virtue of liberality/generosity.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=83}}  It is the deficiency of giving to or the excess of taking from others.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=86,88}}{{sfn|Holgate|1999|p=231}}  The other vice is prodigality (excess of giving to or deficiency of taking from), which Aristotle describes as both less common than meanness and less of a vice.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=234,102}}

Meanness can take many forms, as there are several ways in which one can deviate from the liberal/generous virtue.  It can be a desire for wealth with insufficient desire to benefit others; or a desire to benefit others suppressed by an excessive desire to keep what money one has; or the desire for too much wealth.  Aristotle said that "meanness we always impute to those who care more than they ought for wealth" and "there seem to be many kinds of meanness".{{sfn|Holgate|1999|p=231}}{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=99&amp;ndash;100}}

The translation of what Aristotle meant is not without problems.  Aristotle's actual word ''ἐλευθερία'' ([[eleutheria]]) corresponds with both liberality and freedom.  Its opposite, ''ανἐλευθερία'', is both meanness and servility.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=94}}  Philosophers such as Susanne E. Foster (in {{harvnb|Foster|1997}}) have attempted to reconcile these by explaining that the connotation is that meanness is enslavement by one's material possessions.  A slave has no possessions to give and is not the recipient of gifts from others; whereas a free person, in a gift-exchanging culture, can give and take freely.  Meanness, therefore, is the vice of a free person behaving, in such a culture, as a slave does.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=94}}

Another problem that has taxed philosophers analysing Aristotle is that the expected continuum (on which vices and a virtue lie) is from excess to deficiency; but Aristotle describes meanness as ''both'' excess (of taking from) ''and'' deficiency (of giving to).  Philosophers have attempted to explain this, and characterize what Aristotle was trying to say as an excess or a deficiency in some other form.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=101}}  Howard J. Curzer takes the view that in fact both were meant, and that it is "misguided" to ask whether Aristotelian meanness is excess or deficiency, because what constitutes excess and what constitutes deficiency "depends upon how the parameters are described" and is "purely a verbal matter".  Exactly which vice of the two that brackets a virtue is "excess" and which is "deficiency" is entirely arbitrary.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=101}}

Curzer also contends that Aristotle's statement that meanness is worse than prodigality is "a mistake", based upon an erroneous choice of exemplars of prodigality.  There are, in Curzer's contention "true prodigals", who are not merely young and foolish (as Aristotle would have prodigals be, and arguing thereby that youth and foolishness are curable &amp;mdash; the former by simple dint of growing old &amp;mdash; whereas meanness is not{{sfn|Holgate|1999|p=231}}) but "incurably wicked" and thus more proper exemplars of the vice, who demonstrate that it is just as much of a vice as meanness is.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=101}}

=== Aquinas ===
In his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' {{harv|Aquinas|loc=question 135}}, [[Thomas Aquinas]] explicitly cited Aristotle (as "The Philosopher") and held meanness &amp;mdash; ''parvificentia'' in his original Latin &amp;mdash; to be the opposite of magnificence (''magnificentia'').{{sfn|Davies|2014|p=271}}  Whilst a magnificent person is willing to pay for great projects and good causes, a mean person focuses upon penny-pinching and settles for small goals at the expense of great ones.{{sfn|Davies|2014|p=271}}

=== Others ===
[[Theodore Parker]], like Aristotle, opposed meanness and generosity, declaring meanness as an "unmanly and unwomanly vice".  He differentiated two forms of meanness: ''pecuniary meanness'', which is meanness in things measurable with money, and ''meanness of behaviour'', which is meanness in things not thus measurable.{{sfn|Parker|1872|p=114}}

[[George Crabb (writer)|George Crabb]] described meanness as "[w]hatever a man does in common with those below him" and that "evinces a temper that is prone to sink rather than rise in the scale of society".  He considered meanness to be only relatively bad, as what may constitute meanness for one person may be generosity or prudence for another.  Seeking to save or to gain for oneself at the expense of others, in particular with respect to what one can afford to pay, "is denominated a mean temper".{{sfn|Crabb|Hedley|1839|p=392}}

[[Henry Sidgwick]] in ''The Methods of Ethics'' held meanness to be both the opposite of liberality and generosity.{{sfn|Crisp|2015|p=183}} A mean person "chooses a trifling gain to himself rather than the avoidance of disappointment to others", and meanness is not injustice per se.{{sfn|Crisp|2015|p=183}}

== Modern view as cruelty ==
[[Samuel Johnson]] wrote in ''The False Alarm'' that "[a]n infallible characteristic of meanness is cruelty".{{sfn|Johnson|1770|p=49}} [[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|Linda Zagzebski]] stated that meanness is "an acquired defect" that is "opposed to kindness".{{sfn|Zagzebski|2015|p=256}}  These signifiy the modern view of meanness, which has concentrated upon cruelty, bullying, and remorselessness.

In the [[Psychopathy#Triarchic model|Triarchic Psychopathy Measure]], one of the several ways of defining what psychopathy is, meanness is one of the three components, an index of a person's "callous aggression".{{sfn|Patrick|2014|p=201}}  It is characterized as callous unemotionality, antagonism, coldheartedness, exploitativeness, remorselessness, and empowerment through cruelty; encompassing destructive acts, the inability to bond with other people, bullying, fight-picking, and other forms of active engagement against other people (in contrast to social withdrawal, which is a passive moving away from other people).{{sfn|Drislane|Patrick|2014|p=695}}{{sfn|Drislane|Venables|Patrick|2014|pp=110&amp;ndash;111}}

=== "Mean girls" ===

Many of these aspects of meanness &amp;mdash; namely empowerment, bullying, aggression, cruelty, and ruthlessness &amp;mdash; have been incorporated in the late 20th and early 21st century popular cultural concept of the "mean girl".{{sfn|Ringrose|Walkerdine|2008|p=9&amp;ndash;10}}  Social science professor Valerie Walkerdine argues that "meanness is becoming a dominant motif for Western girlhood", as it fits well with the normative, repressive, boundaries of what is appropriate to modern femininity in work and school, and supports the narrative that empowered, successful, females cannot treat empowerment and success positively, but rather always risk slipping into cruelty.{{sfn|Ringrose|Walkerdine|2008|p=10}}  With sociology professor Jessica Ringrose she contends that the "mean girl" stereotype from popular culture, as supported by what they criticise as "highly suspect" research in [[developmental psychology]], is being increasingly taken up by policy makers in education.{{sfn|Ringrose|Walkerdine|2008|p=10}}  And that in turn, with things like the Hollywood movie ''[[Mean Girls]]'' being partly based upon the [[self-help]] book ''[[Queen Bees and Wannabes]]'' by [[Rosalind Wiseman]], feeds from psychology and pedagogy back into popular culture.{{sfn|Ringrose|Walkerdine|2008|p=11}}

{{Granulometry}}

'''Mesh''' is a measurement of particle size often used in determining the [[particle-size distribution]] of a [[granular material]].  For example, a sample from a truckload of peanuts may be placed atop a mesh with 5&amp;nbsp;mm openings. When the mesh is shaken, small broken pieces and dust pass through the mesh while whole peanuts are retained on the mesh.  A commercial peanut buyer might use a test like this to determine if a batch of peanuts has too many broken pieces.  This type of test is common in some industries, and, to facilitate uniform testing methods, several standardized mesh series have been established.

Metal surfaces [[metal polishing|mechanically polished]] are designated as having a [[mechanical finish]] related to the abrasive used.

Many mesh sizes were historically given in the number of holes per inch; due to the width of the wires in the mesh, mesh numbers did not correspond directly to fractional inch sizes, and several different systems standardized with slightly different mesh sizes for the same mesh numbers.

Equivalent mesh sizes from 5&amp;nbsp;μm to 25.4&amp;nbsp;mm also exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Equivalent mesh sizes from 5microns to 25.4mm | url = http://delloyd.50megs.com/moreinfo/mesh.html | accessdate = 2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Particle Size Conversion | url = http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/chemistry/stockroom-reagents/learning-center/technical-library/particle-size-conversion.html | accessdate = 2012-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Available sieve sizes are usually regulated by standards.  Those in common use are ISO 565:1990 and ISO 3310-1:2000 (international), EN 933-1(European) and ASTM E11:01 (US).  EN standards are available with national 'badging' so appear as BS EN, FR EN, DE, etc.

== Practical sizes ==

Although such information contains long lists of sieve sizes, in practice sieves are normally used in series in which each member sieve is selected to pass particles approximately 1/{{radic|2}} or 1/2 smaller in size than the previous sieve.  For example the series 80mm, 63, 40, 31.5, 20, 16, 14, 10, 8, 6.3, 4, 2.8, 2&amp;nbsp;mm is routinely available in many European countries or the series with the larger steps 63, 31.5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1&amp;nbsp;mm, 500&amp;nbsp;μm, 250, 125, 63&amp;nbsp;μm is commonly used to grade aggregates in the construction industry.  Such series are somewhat derived from the principles originally established by Renard and now known as [[Renard series]]. Some users replace some of those indicated above with 45, 22.4, 12.5, 11.2 and 5.6&amp;nbsp;mm sieves, mostly because of historical usage of such sizes in their country or industry.

A '''mirror punishment''' is a penal form of [[poetic justice]] which reflects the nature or means of the crime in the means of (often physical) punishment as a form of [[retributive justice]]—the practice of "repaying" a wrongdoer "in kind".

It can be an application of the ''lex talionis'' (“[[an eye for an eye]]”), but is not always [[proportional justice]], as a similar method may be used to produce a worse or milder effect than the crime it "retaliates".

The simplest method of mirror punishment is to enact the same action upon the criminal as the criminal perpetrated upon the victim. For example, thieves have the same amount of money taken from them as they stole; one who strikes another is struck in the same way; one who willfully causes another person's death is killed; and so on.

Often, however, a more esoteric method of mirror punishment is used, which implies punishing the part of the criminal's body used to commit the crime. Extreme examples include the amputation of the hands of a [[thief]], as still permitted by [[Sharia]] law, or during the [[Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]]; or disabling the foot or leg of a runaway slave. 
[[File:Station 1 Handabschlagen Bamberger Kreuzweg.jpg|thumb]]

Other examples include the punishment of [[adultery|adulterous]] women by the insertion of irritating substances into their vaginas (in the past hot pokers were sometimes used). A less extreme example is putting soap into a child's mouth for using inappropriate language (referred to in English as "washing someone's mouth out with soap"). 	

Another method to accomplish "poetic justice" is to mirror the physical method of the crime, e.g., executing a murderer with his own weapon, burning [[arson]]ists alive, or in a more far-fetched example, boiling a counterfeiter alive (because [[bullion]] is boiled to be minted{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}).

==Popular culture==
W. S. Gilbert's comic opera ''[[The Mikado]]'' contains a song satirizing mirror punishment. For example:

:The billiard-sharp whom anyone catches 
:His doom’s extremely hard—
:He’s made to dwell 
:In a dungeon cell 
:On a spot that’s always barred.
:And there he plays extravagant matches 
:In fitless finger-stalls, 
:On a cloth untrue 
:With a twisted cue
:And elliptical billiard balls.

The refrain line "to let the punishment fit the crime" has sometimes been quoted in the course of British political debates, though the concept predates Gilbert.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;Green, Edward. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3634126.stm "Ballads,songs and speeches",] ''BBC News'', 20 September 2004, accessed 30 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://keithwiley.com/mindRamblings/deathPenalty.shtml Keith Wiley webpage], referring to the Code of [[Hammurabi]]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, episode 80 of the television series ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', entitled "Let the Punishment Fit the Crime", features bits of several songs from ''The Mikado''.&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of Magnum, P.I. episodes|Wikipedia List of Magnum, P.I. episodes]] and [http://www.tv.com/magnum-p.i./let-the-punishment-fit-the-crime/episode/16074/summary.html TV.com Magnum, P.I. Episode Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase and the Mikado's song also are featured in the ''[[Dad's Army]]'' episode, "A Soldier's Farewell." In ''[[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|The Parent Trap]]'' (1961), the camp director quotes the phrase before sentencing the twins to the isolation cabin together.

'''Norbert Brunner''' (born 1969, [[Hohenems]], [[Austria]]) is an Austrian object, [[Conceptual art|conceptual]] and installation artist. Brunner’s mirror objects reflect not only the viewer, but also superimpose messages across their visual path, insisting they become an interactive part of the installation. He studied on the [[University of Applied Arts Vienna]]. Currently Brunner lives and works in [[Vienna]] and [[New York City]].

==Work==

Norbert Brunner's works are meant to inspire for the beholder to get a "broader" attitude of mind. In his objects he translates two dimensional images into a multi-dimensional design. His objects demand that the viewer examines them closely for full visual appreciation and understanding. This spatial interaction with the sculpture is forcing the viewer into a more extensive contention with the artwork. Brunner's mirror objects reflect not only the viewer, but also superimpose written messages. Using few but compelling words, Brunner’s texts reflect infinite possibilities asking us to formulate our own interpretation of reality.

Brunner employs acrylic glass, [[Swarovski]] crystal, mirror, photographic prints, paint, and foil in his creations that range in size from personal and intimate to monumental and communal. In his objects he defines the dot as the lowest common denominator. Everything consists of these dots, which are located next or above one another and make up the image. 
By putting foil dots on several layers of acrylic glass and mirrors he arranges layers in a sandwich system. When the viewer changes his position towards the object these images dissolve into many individual parts and reassemble only when seen from the right angle.

Brunner is always dreaming up new techniques and mediums to employ new means of "communication". As source material for his works, Brunner uses well-known objects or texts from everyday life which are universally familiar. They become his vocabulary of global communication with the aim to reach as many people as possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3688">In the [[applied sciences]], '''normative science''' is a type of information that is developed, presented, or interpreted based on an assumed, usually unstated, preference for a particular policy or class of policies.&lt;ref&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2004).  [http://fw.oregonstate.edu/system/files/u2937/2004c%20-%20Normative%20Science%20-%20Reprint%20-%20Lackey.pdf Normative Science], Fisheries, American Fisheries Society.  29(7): 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Regular or traditional [[science]] does not presuppose a [[policy]] preference, but normative science, by definition, does.&lt;ref&gt;Ooms, Gorik.

BMC International Health and Human Rights. 14: 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Common examples of such policy preferences are arguments that pristine [[ecosystems]] are preferable to human altered ones, that native species are preferable to nonnative species, and that higher [[biodiversity]] is preferable to lower biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2007). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00639.x/abstract;jsessionid=1E4F2F827867D075DD43D28821A08A13.d03t03?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+3+Dec+from+10-12+GMT+for+monthly+maintenance Science, scientists, and policy advocacy].

Conservation Biology. 26(1): 39-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In more general philosophical terms, normative science is a form of [[inquiry]], typically involving a community of inquiry and its accumulated body of provisional knowledge, that seeks to discover good ways of achieving recognized aims, ends, goals, objectives, or purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Sabine, George H. (1912). [https://archive.org/details/jstor-2177252 Descriptive and normative sciences]. The Philosophical Review. 21(4): 433-450.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brueckner, Martin and Pierre Horwitz. (2005).

Sustainability: Science, Practice, &amp; Policy. 1(2): 14-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many political debates revolve around arguments over which of the many "good ways" shall be selected.&lt;ref&gt;Short, T. L. (2012). [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/transactions_of_the_charles_s_peirce_society/v048/48.3.short01.html Normative science?] Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society. 48(3): 310-334.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, when presented as scientific information, words such as [[ecosystem health]], [[biological integrity]], and [[environmental degradation]] are typically examples of normative science because they each presuppose a policy preference and are therefore a type of [[policy advocacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Landis, Wayne G.

'''''R (Begum) v Governors of Denbigh High School''''' [2006] is a [[House of Lords]] case on the legal regulation of religious symbols and dress under the [[Human Rights Act 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/15.html UKHL 15, House of Lords Decisions] Retrieved 2014-06-25&lt;/ref&gt;

The case involved Shabina Begum, a Muslim pupil at [[Denbigh High School, Luton|Denbigh High School]] in [[Luton]], UK, who sued her school.&lt;ref name="Emon2012"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wFbWEPGx7SkC&amp;pg=PA291|title=Religious Pluralism and Islamic Law: Dhimmis and Others in the Empire of Law|author=Anver M. Emon|date=26 July 2012|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-966163-3|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Begum opposed the schools requirement that she wear the [[shalwar kameez]] Denbigh school uniform instead of a longer, looser Muslim gown (a [[jilbāb]]), on the grounds that the uniform was not compliant with  [[Sharia]] law.  Begum lost her case in the High Court,&lt;ref&gt;[2004] EWHC 1389 (Admin)&lt;/ref&gt; won on appeal to the Court of Appeal,&lt;ref&gt;[2005] EWCA Civ 199&lt;/ref&gt; but then lost in March 2006 when the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords unanimously overturned the first appeal.&lt;ref name="bbc-22-3-06"&gt;{{cite news|title=School wins Muslim dress appeal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/4832072.stm|accessdate=20 February 2016|agency=BBC News|date=22 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Langlaude2007"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVmwCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA227|title=The Right of the Child to Religious Freedom in International Law|author=Sylvie Langlaude|date=12 December 2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-474-2350-8|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The case==
Shabina Begum ({{lang-bn|শবিনা বেগম}}; born in the UK, aged 16 at the time and of [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshi]] origin), was a pupil at [[Denbigh High School, Luton|Denbigh High School]] in [[Luton]], [[Bedfordshire]]. Four out of the six parent governors were Muslims, the Chair of the Luton Council of Mosques was a community governor and three of the LEA governors were also Muslims. However the school also contained a significant number of pupils of other faiths and the school wished to be inclusive in serving the needs of this diverse community and regarded the school uniform as promoting a sense of communal identity. In addition to uniforms incorporating trousers or skirts, female pupils are also offered a uniform based on the [[Pakistan]]i or [[Punjab region|Punjabi]] [[shalwar kameez]] with optional [[khimar]]. The school uniform was decided upon in consultation with local mosques, religious organisations and parents. The School considered the shalwar kameez ideal as it was worn by several faith groups and, accordingly, helped to minimise the differences between them.

For two years, Ms. Begum attended the school without complaint, wearing the shalwar kameez, but in September 2002, Ms. Begum, accompanied by her brother and another young male, went to the school and asked that she be allowed to wear the long coat-like garment known as the [[jilbāb]]. In the opinion of Begum and her supporters, the particular form of shalwar kameez offered by the school was relatively close-fitting with short sleeves, and was therefore not compliant with the requirements of [[Sartorial hijab|Islamic dress]] as they are stated in [[Sharia]] law. Shabina refused to attend for three years unless she was allowed to wear the jilbab to school. She said she believed that this was required by her [[Muslim]] faith, but also in contravention of the [[school uniform]] policy. In addition, the jilbab was, in the opinion of Begum and her supporters, a more culturally-neutral form of Islamic attire.

The school's supporters claimed that after Begum's parents had died, she had come under the undue influence of her brother Shuweb Rahman. They also argued that if Begum was allowed to attend classes wearing jilbab, other pupils would feel under pressure to adopt stricter forms of Islamic dress.{{fact?|date=December 2016}}

Begum, with her brother, issued a claim for judicial review of the school's decision not to allow her to wear the jilbab at school.  The claim was made on the grounds that the school had interfered with her right to manifest her religion (Article 9 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]) and her right to education (Article 2(1) of the first protocol).

==Judgment==

===Appeals===
Begum lost the case in the [[EWHC|High Court]], but later won on appeal to the [[EWCA|Court of Appeal]]. The school [[appeal]]ed against this decision, and the case was heard by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|Judicial Committee of the House of Lords]]. The [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]] was allowed to make submissions in the hearing in the House of Lords.  The House of Lords ruled in favour of the school. Begum was represented in the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords by the former Prime Minister's wife [[Cherie Blair|Cherie Blair QC]].

===House of Lords===
[[Tom Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|Lord Bingham of Cornhill]] stressed at the outset of his judgment that,

{{Cquote|this case concerns a particular pupil and a particular school in a particular place at a particular time.  It must be resolved on facts which are now, for purposes of the appeal, agreed.  The House is not, and could not be, invited to rule on whether Islamic dress, or any feature of Islamic dress, should or should not be permitted in the schools of this country.}}

The Law Lords took the view that a person's right to hold a particular religious belief was absolute (i.e. could not be interfered with), but that a person's right to manifest a particular religious belief was qualified (i.e. it could be interfered with if there was a justification).

Three of the five Law Lords held that Begum's rights had not been interfered with&lt;ref&gt;{{Halsbury|88A|School uniform, curriculum and discipline.|444|6}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Lord Bingham, [[Lord Scott of Foscote]] and [[Lord Hoffmann]]), and two held that they had ([[Lord Nicholls|Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead]] and [[Brenda Hale, Baroness Hale of Richmond|Baroness Hale of Richmond]]).

All five agreed, however, that in this particular case there were justifiable grounds for interference, one of the grounds being to protect the rights of other female students at the school who would not wish to be pressured into adopting a more extreme form of dress.

Shown here is a battle scene from the [[First Crusade]].]] '''Religious violence''' is a term that covers phenomena where [[religion]] is either the subject or the object of [[Violence|violent behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Wellman|first= James|author2=Tokuno, Kyoko |year= 2004|title= Is Religious Violence Inevitable?|publisher=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2004.00234.x|journal= Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume= 43|issue= 3|pages= 291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious violence is, specifically, violence that is motivated by or in reaction to religious precepts, texts, or doctrines. This includes violence against religious institutions, people, objects, or events when the violence is motivated to some degree by some religious aspect of the target or by the precepts of the attacker. Religious violence does not refer exclusively to acts committed by religious groups, but includes acts committed by secular groups against religious groups.

Violence is a very broad concept and it is also difficult to define since it can be used against non-human objects.&lt;ref name="Houben Kooji" /&gt; Furthermore, the term can denote a wide variety of experiences such as blood shedding, physical harm, forcing against personal freedom, passionate conduct or language, or emotions such as fury and passion.&lt;ref name="Ralph Tanner" /&gt;

Religion is a complex and problematic concept.&lt;ref name="50 great1" /&gt; It is a modern western-compartmentalized concept that was not found anywhere before the 1500s and despite it being recently invented, there is no scholarly consensus over what a religion is.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="50 great1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nongbri" /&gt; In general, religion is conceived as an abstraction which entails beliefs, doctrines, and sacred places even though the ancient cultures that wrote Holy Scriptures (e.g. Bible, Quran, etc) did not have such a concept in their holy scriptures, language, or history.&lt;ref name="Nongbri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="50 great1" /&gt; Decades of anthropological, sociological, and psychological research have shown that the assumption that religious beliefs and values are tightly integrated in an individual's mind or that religious practices and behaviors follow directly from religious beliefs, is actually rare. People’s religious ideas are fragmented, loosely connected, and context-dependent just like in all other domains of culture and life.&lt;ref name="chaves"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chaves|first1=Mark|title=SSSR Presidential Address Rain Dances in the Dry Season: Overcoming the Religious Congruence Fallacy|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|date=March 2010|volume=49|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01489.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, religions, ethical systems, and societies rarely promote violence as an end in itself since violence is universally undesirable.&lt;ref name="Houben Kooji"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Houben|editor1-first=Jan|editor2-last=van Kooji|editor2-first=Karel|title=Violence Denied : Violence, Non-violence and the Rationalization of Violence in South Asian Cultural History|date=1999|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden ; Boston ; Köln|isbn=9004113444|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, there is a universal tension between the general desire to avoid violence and the acceptance of justifiable uses of violence to prevent a "greater evil" that permeates all cultures.&lt;ref name="Houben Kooji" /&gt; Religious violence, like all violence, is a cultural process that is context-dependent and very complex.&lt;ref name=Rowley2 /&gt; Oversimplifications of religion and violence often lead to misguided understandings and exaggerations of causes for why some people commit violence and why most do not commit violence.&lt;ref name=Rowley2 /&gt; Religious violence is primarily the domain of the violent "actor", which may be distinguished between individual and collective forms of violence. Overall, religious violence is perpetrated for a wide variety of [[ideology|ideological]] reasons and is generally only one of the contributing social and political factors that leads to unrest.

Studies of supposed cases of religious violence often conclude that violence is strongly driven by ethnic animosities rather than by religious worldviews.&lt;ref name="Omar"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Omar|editor1-first=Irfan|editor2-last=Duffey|editor2-first=Michael|title=Peacemaking and the Challenge of Violence in World Religions|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781118953426|page=1|ref=Omar Peacemaking|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, scholars have questioned the very concept of "religious violence" and the extent to which religious, political, [[War#Economic|economic]], or [[ethnic conflict|ethnic]] aspects of a conflict are even meaningful.&lt;ref name="Cavanaugh myth"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Myth of Religious Violence|first=William|last=Cavanaugh |publisher=Oxford University Press US,|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some observe that the very concept of "religion" is a modern invention and not something that is universal across cultures or historical and thereby makes "religious violence" a myth.&lt;ref name="Cavanaugh myth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt; Since all cases of violence and war include social, political, and economic dimensions and since there is no consensus on definitions of "religion" among scholars and no way to isolate "religion" from the rest of the more likely motivational dimensions, it is incorrect to label any violent event as "religious".&lt;ref name="50 great"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morreall|first1=John|last2=Sonn|first2=Tamara|title=50 Great Myths of Religion|date=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780470673508|pages=39–44|chapter=Myth 8.

==History of the concept of religion==
{{main|Definition of religion}}

Religion is a [[modern era|modern]] [[Western culture|Western]] concept.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|first=Timothy|last=Fitzgerald|title=Discourse on Civility and Barbarity|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of religion is not found anywhere before the 1500s.&lt;ref name="50 great1" /&gt; Furthermore, parallel concepts are not found in many cultures and there is no equivalent term for "religion" in many languages.&lt;ref name="50 great1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morreall|first1=John|last2=Sonn|first2=Tamara|title=50 Great Myths of Religion|date=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780470673508|pages=12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have found it difficult to develop a consistent definition, with some giving up on the possibility of a definition&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM. (2002). 'Sociological Definitions, Language Games and the "Essence" of Religion'. Method &amp; theory in the study of religion, vol 14, no. 1, pp. 61–83. [http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3073/1/McKinnon_Definition_of_Religion_author_version_no_format.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josephson, Jason Ānanda. (2012) ''The Invention of Religion in Japan.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; and others rejecting the term entirely.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Others argue that regardless of its definition, it is not appropriate to apply it to non-Western cultures.&lt;ref name=dubuisson&gt;Daniel Dubuisson, ''The Western Construction of Religion''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"/&gt;

The modern concept of "religion" as an abstraction which entails distinct sets of beliefs or doctrines is a recent invention in the English language since such usage began with texts from the 17th century due to the splitting of [[Christendom]] during the [[Protestant Reformation]] and more prevalent [[colonization]] or [[globalization]] in the [[Age of Discovery|age of exploration]] which involved contact with numerous foreign and indigenous cultures with non-European languages.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Peter |title=The Territories of Science and Religion |date=2015 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=022618448X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Religion enlightenment"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Peter|title='Religion' and the Religions in the English Enlightenment|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521892937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient sacred texts like the [[Bible]] and the [[Quran]] did not have a concept of religion in their original languages and neither did their authors or the cultures to which they belonged.&lt;ref name=Nongbri&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nongbri |first1=Brent |title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept |date=2013 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=030015416X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="50 great1" /&gt;
It was in the 19th century that the terms "[[Buddhism]]", "[[Hinduism]]", "[[Taoism]]", and "[[Confucianism]]" first emerged.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Invention Japan"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Josephson |first1=Jason Ananda |title=The Invention of Religion in Japan |date=2012 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0226412342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no precise equivalent of "religion" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and [[Judaism]] does not draw clear distinctions between religious, national, racial, or ethnic identities.&lt;ref&gt;Hershel Edelheit, Abraham J. Edelheit,  [https://www.questia.com/library/book/history-of-zionism-a-handbook-and-dictionary-by-abfaham-j-edelheit-hershel-edelheit.jsp History of Zionism: A Handbook and Dictionary], p.3, citing [[Solomon Zeitlin]], ''The Jews. Race, Nation, or Religion?'' (Philadelphia: Dropsie College Press, 1936).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of violence==

Violence is difficult to define because the term is a "thick concept" in that it broadly carries a descriptive and evaluative components which ranges from harming non-human objects to human self-harm.&lt;ref name="Houben Kooji" /&gt; Ralph Tanner cites the definition of violence in the Oxford English Dictionary as "far beyond (the infliction of) pain and the shedding of blood." He argues that, although violence clearly encompasses injury to persons or property, it also includes "the forcible interference with personal freedom, violent or passionate conduct or language (and) finally passion or fury."&lt;ref name="Ralph Tanner"&gt;{{cite book |title=Violence and Religion: Cross-cultural Opinions and Consequences |author= Ralph E.S. Tanner|publisher=Concept Publishing Company |year=2007 |pages=5–6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3xQXYpfe0cYC&amp;pg=PA5 |isbn= 9788180693762}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, Abhijit Nayak writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The word "violence" can be defined to extend far beyond pain and shedding blood. It carries the meaning of physical force, violent language, fury, and, more importantly, forcible interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=International Review of Mission |first=Abhijit |last=Nayak |title=Crusade Violence: Understanding and Overcoming the Impact of Mission Among Muslims |volume=97|issue=386–387|pages=273–291 |date=July–October 2008|publisher=World Council of Churches |doi=10.1111/j.1758-6631.2008.tb00645.x |accessdate=2010-11-23 |url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-10493656/Crusade-violence-understanding-and-overcoming.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Terence Fretheim writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

For many people, ... only physical violence truly qualifies as violence. But, certainly, violence is more than killing people, unless one includes all those words and actions that kill people slowly. The effect of limitation to a “killing fields” perspective is the widespread neglect of many other forms of violence. We must insist that violence also refers to that which is psychologically destructive, that which demeans, damages, or depersonalizes others. In view of these considerations, violence may be defined as follows: any action, verbal or nonverbal, oral or written, physical or psychical, active or passive, public or private, individual or institutional/societal, human or divine, in whatever degree of intensity, that abuses, violates, injures, or kills. Some of the most pervasive and most dangerous forms of violence are those that are often hidden from view (against women and children, especially); just beneath the surface in many of our homes, churches, and communities is abuse enough to freeze the
blood. Moreover, many forms of systemic violence often slip past our attention because they are so much a part of the infrastructure of life (e.g., racism, sexism, ageism).&lt;ref name=Fretheim&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Word &amp; World |first=Terence |last=Freitheim |title=God and Violence in the Old Testament |volume=24 |issue=1 |date=Winter 2004 |url=http://www2.luthersem.edu/word&amp;world/Archives/24-1_Violence/24-1_Fretheim.pdf|accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Relationships between religion and violence==

Charles Selengut characterizes the phrase "religion and violence" as "jarring," asserting that "religion is thought to be opposed to violence and a force for peace and reconciliation. He acknowledges, however, that "the history and scriptures of the world's religions tell stories of violence and war even as they speak of peace and love."&lt;ref name=Selengut&gt;{{cite book |title=Sacred fury: understanding religious violence |first=Charles |last=Selengut|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mOqtEkGlq0cC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=%22sectarian+violence%22+%22religious+violence%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sectarian%20violence%22%20%22religious%20violence%22&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-7425-6084-0 |date=2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Matthew Rowley, three hundred contributing causes of religious violence have been discussed by some scholars, however he notes that "violence in the name of God is a complex phenomenon and oversimplification further jeopardizes peace because it obscures many of the causal factors."&lt;ref name=Rowley1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rowley|first1=Matthew|title=What Causes Religious Violence?|journal=Journal of Religion and Violence|date=2014|volume=2|issue=3|pages=361–402|doi=10.5840/jrv20153234}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another piece, Matthew Rowley notes 15 ways to address the complexity of violence, both secular and religious, and notes that secular narratives of religious violence tend to be erroneous or exaggerated due to over simplification of religious people, their beliefs, thinking in false dichotomies, and ignoring complex secular causes of supposed "religious violence". He also notes that when discussing religious violence, one should also note that the overwhelming majority of religious people do not get inspired to engage in violence.&lt;ref name=Rowley2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rowley|first1=Matthew|title=How Should We Respond to Religious Violence?

Ralph Tanner similarly describes the combination of religion and violence as "uncomfortable", asserting that religious thinkers generally avoid the conjunction of the two and argue that religious violence is "only valid in certain circumstances which are invariably one-sided".&lt;ref name=Tanner2007&gt;{{cite book|title=Violence and religion: cross-cultural opinions and consequences|first= Ralph E. S. |last=Tanner |publisher=Concept Publishing Company|year=2007 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3xQXYpfe0cYC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Christianity+%22violent+religion%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false|isbn= 9788180693762 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Jerryson argues that scholarship on religion and violence sometimes overlook non-Abrahamic religions. This tendency provides considerable problems, one of which is the support of faulty associations. For example, he finds a persistent global pattern to align religious like Islam as a cause for violence and others like Buddhism as an explanation of peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jerryson|first=Michael|date=2015-05-06|title=Buddhists and Violence: Historical Continuity/Academic Incongruity|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/rec3.12152/full|journal=Religion Compass|volume=9|issue=5|pages=141–150, 141|doi=10.1111/rec3.12152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many instances of political violence, religion tends to play a central role. This is especially true of [[terrorism]], which sees violence committed against unarmed noncombatants in order to inspire fear and achieve some political goal. Terrorism expert [[Martha Crenshaw]] suggests that religion is just a mask used by political movements to draw support. Crenshaw outlines two approaches in observing religious violence to view the underlying mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crenshaw|first=Martha|date=1987-12-01|title=Theories of terrorism: Instrumental and organizational approaches|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01402398708437313|journal=Journal of Strategic Studies|volume=10|issue=4|pages=13–31|doi=10.1080/01402398708437313|issn=0140-2390}}&lt;/ref&gt; One approach, called the instrumental approach, sees religious violence as acting as a rational calculation to achieve some political end. Increasing the costs of performing such violence will help curb it. Crenshaw’s alternate approach sees religious violence stemming from the organizational structure of religious communities, with the heads of these communities acting as political figureheads. Crenshaw suggests that threatening the internal stability of these organizations (perhaps by offering a nonviolent alternative) will dissuade religious organizations from performing political violence. A third approach sees religious violence as a result of community dynamics rather than religious duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mv-jBRlsSlcC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=Terrorism+a+Communitarian+Approach&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=knMnTfXJbo&amp;sig=YZBNEWvwT7EAAkUMjcC2xgK-wp4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwie1ZymlpzUAhWEOCYKHTBGCyYQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Terrorism%20a%20Communitarian%20Approach&amp;f=false|title=Building Terrorism Resistant Communities: Together Against Terrorism|last=Ekici|first=S.|last2=Ekici|first2=A.|date=2009|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=9781607500063|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Symbolic interactionism|Systems of meanings]] developed within these communities allow for religious interpretation to justify violence, and so acts like terrorism happen because people are part of communities of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Terror_in_the_Mind_of_God.html?id=lpb1mbaHjGQC|title=Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence|last=Juergensmeyer|first=Mark|date=2003|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520240117|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, religious violence and terrorism are performances designed to inspire an emotional reaction from both those in the community and those outside of it.

While religion can be used as a means of rallying support for violence, religious leaders regularly denounce such manipulations as contrary to the teachings of their belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pope Benedict apologises for Christian violence through the ages after condemning terrorism in the name of religion |author= Ralph E.S.

[[Hector Avalos]] argues that religions create violence over four scarce resources: access to divine will, knowledge, primarily through scripture; sacred space; group privileging; and salvation. Not all religions have or use these four resources. He believes that religious violence is particularly untenable as these resources are never verifiable and, unlike claims to scare resources such a water or land, cannot be adjudicated objectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fighting Words: The Origins of Religious Violence |first=Hector |last=Avalos|publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, New York|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Regina Schwartz]] argues that all monotheistic religions are inherently violent because of an exclusivism that inevitably fosters violence against those that are considered outsiders.&lt;ref name=ReginaSchwartz&gt;{{cite book |title=The Curse of Cain: The Violent Legacy of Monotheism By Regina M. Schwartz |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lawrence Wechsler asserts that Schwartz isn't just arguing that Abrahamic religions have a violent legacy, but that the legacy is actually genocidal in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wechsler |first=Lawrence |title=Mayhem and Monotheism |url=http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/2490/PDF/mayhem.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720030355/http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/2490/PDF/mayhem.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges to the views that religions are violent ==

===Behavioral studies===

Decades of anthropological, sociological, and psychological research have established that "religious congruence" (the assumption that religious beliefs and values are tightly integrated in an individual's mind or that religious practices and behaviors follow directly from religious beliefs or that religious beliefs are chronologically linear and stable across different contexts) is actually rare. People’s religious ideas are fragmented, loosely connected, and context-dependent, as in all other domains of culture and in life. The beliefs, affiliations, and behaviors of any individual are complex activities that have many sources including culture.&lt;ref name="chaves" /&gt;

===Myth of religious violence===

Others such as William Cavanaugh have argued that it is unreasonable to attempt to differentiate "religious violence" and "secular violence" as separate categories. Cavanaugh asserts that "the idea that religion has a tendency to promote violence is part of the conventional wisdom of Western societies and it underlies many of our institutions and policies, from limits on the public role of churches to efforts to promote liberal democracy in the Middle East." Cavanaugh challenges this conventional wisdom, arguing that there is a "myth of religious violence", basing his argument on the assertion that "attempts to separate religious and secular violence are incoherent".
&lt;ref name="Cavanaugh myth2"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Myth of Religious Violence|first=William|last=Cavanaugh |publisher=Oxford University Press US,|year=2009 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cavanaugh asserts:

* Religion is not a universal and transhistorical phenomenon. What counts as "religious" or "secular" in any context is a function of configurations of power both in the West and lands colonized by the West. The distinctions of "Religious/Secular" and "Religious/Political" are modern Western inventions.
* The invention of the concept of "religious violence" helps the West reinforce superiority of Western social orders to "nonsecular" social orders, namely Muslims at the time of publication.
* The concept of "religious violence" can be and is used to legitimate violence against non-Western "Others".
* Peace depends on a balanced view of violence and recognition that so-called secular ideologies and institutions can be just as prone to absolutism, divisiveness, and irrationality.

John Morreall and Tamara Sonn have argued that all cases of violence and war include social, political, and economic dimensions. Since there is no consensus on definitions of "religion" among scholars and no way to isolate "religion" from the rest of the more likely motivational dimensions, it is incorrect to label any violent event as "religious".&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt; They note that since dozens of examples exist from the [[European wars of religion]] that show that people from the same religions fought each other and that people from different religions became allies during these conflicts, the motivations for these conflicts were not about religion.&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt; Jeffrey Burton Russell has argued that the fact that these wars of religion ended after rulers agreed to practice their religions in their own territories, means that the conflicts were more related to political control than about people's religious views.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey Russell" /&gt;

According to Karen Armstrong, so-called religious conflicts such as the Crusades, Spanish Inquisition, and the European wars of religion, were all deeply political conflicts at the core, not religious ones. Especially since people from different faiths constantly became allies and fought each other in no consistent fashion. She notes that the Western concept of separation of church and state, which was advocated first by the Reformer Martin Luther, laid a foundation for viewing society as divided when in reality religion and society were intermixed to the point that no one made such distinction nor was there a defining cut between such experiences in the past. During the Enlightenment, religion began to be seen as an individualistic and private thing and that modern secular ideals like equality of all human beings, intellectual and political liberty were things that were historically promoted in a religious idiom in the past.&lt;ref name="Armstrong Myth"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Armstrong|first1=Karen|title=The Myth of Religious Violence|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/-sp-karen-armstrong-religious-violence-myth-secular|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|date=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;          

Anthropologist Jack David Eller asserts that religion is not inherently violent, arguing "religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical." He asserts that "violence is neither essential to nor exclusive to religion" and that " virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary."&lt;ref name="CruelCreeds1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eller|first=Jack David|title=Cruel Creeds, Virtuous Violence: Religious Violence Across Culture and History|year=2010|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-61614-218-6 |quote=As we have insisted previously, religion is not inherently and irredeemably violent; it certainly is not the essence and source of all violence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CruelCreeds2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eller|first=Jack David|title=Cruel Creeds, Virtuous Violence: Religious Violence Across Culture and History|year=2010|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-61614-218-6 |quote=Religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical. Violence is one phenomenon in human (and natural existence), religion is another, and it is inevitable that the two would become intertwined. Religion is complex and modular, and violence is one of the modules—not universal, but recurring. As a conceptual and behavioral module, violence is by no means exclusive to religion. There are plenty of other groups, institutions, interests, and ideologies to promote violence. Violence is, therefore, neither essential to nor exclusive to religion. Nor is religious violence all alike... And virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he argues that religion "may be more a marker of the [conflicting] groups than an actual point of contention between them".&lt;ref name="Anthropology of Religion"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eller|first=Jack David|title=Introducing Anthropology of Religion|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-40896-7|quote=When a pure or hybrid religious group and/or its interests are threatened, or merely blocked from achieving its interests by another group, conflict and violence may ensue. In such cases, although religion is part of the issue and religious groups form the competitors, or combatants, it would be simplistic or wrong to assume the religion is the "cause" of the trouble or that the parties are "fighting about religion". Religion in the circumstances may be more a marker of the groups than an actual point of contention between them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
John Teehan takes a position that integrates the two opposing sides of this debate. He describes the traditional response in defense of religion as "draw(ing) a distinction between the religion and what is done in the name of that religion or its faithful." Teehan argues, "this approach to religious violence may be understandable but it is ultimately untenable and prevents us from gaining any useful insight into either religion or religious violence." He takes the position that "violence done in the name of religion is not a perversion of religious belief... but flows naturally from the moral logic inherent in many religious systems, particularly monotheistic religions...." However, Teehan acknowledges that "religions are also powerful sources of morality." He asserts, "religious morality and religious violence both spring from the same source, and this is the evolutionary psychology underlying religious ethics."&lt;ref name=Teehan&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Teehan |title=In the Name of God: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Ethics and Violence |publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2010 |pages=145–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians such as [[Jonathan Kirsch]] have made links between the European inquisitions, for example, and Stalin's persecutions in the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, McCarthy blacklists, and other secular events as being the same type of phenomenon as the inquisitions.&lt;ref name="Grand Inquisitor's Manual"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirsch|first=Jonathan|title=The Grand Inquisitor's Manual: A History of Terror in the Name of God|year=2009|publisher=HarperOne|isbn=978-0-06-173276-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as [[Robert Pape]], a political scientist who specializes in suicide terrorism, have made a case for secular motivations and reasons as being foundations of most suicide attacks that are oftentimes labeled as "religious".&lt;ref name="Dying to Win"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pape|first=Robert|title=Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism|year=2005|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-8129-7338-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pape compiled the first complete database of every documented suicide bombing during 1980–2003. He argues that the news reports about [[suicide attack]]s are profoundly misleading &amp;mdash; "There is little connection between [[suicide terrorism]] and [[Islamic fundamentalism]], or any one of the world's religions". After studying 315 suicide attacks carried out over the last two decades, he concludes that suicide bombers' actions stem fundamentally from political conflict, not religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pape|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secularism as a response==

Byron Bland asserts that one of the most prominent reasons for the "rise of the secular in Western thought" was the reaction against the religious violence of the 16th and 17th centuries. He asserts that "(t)he secular was a way of living with the religious differences that had produced so much horror. Under secularity, political entities have a warrant to make decisions independent from the need to enforce particular versions of religious orthodoxy. Indeed, they may run counter to certain strongly held beliefs if made in the interest of common welfare. Thus, one of the important goals of the secular is to limit violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Byron |last=Bland |title=Evil Enemies: The Convergence of Religion and Politics |url=http://www.law.stanford.edu/program/centers/scicn/papers/religion_and_political_violence.pdf |date=May 2003 |page=4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202011617/http://www.law.stanford.edu/program/centers/scicn/papers/religion_and_political_violence.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William T. Cavanaugh]] writes that what he calls "the myth of religious violence" as a reason for the rise of secular states may be traced to earlier philosophers, such as Spinoza, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Voltaire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/historically_speaking/summary/v012/12.2.yerxa.html Interview with William Cavanaugh]&lt;/ref&gt; Cavanaugh delivers a detailed critique of this idea in his 2009 book ''The Myth of Religious Violence: Secular Ideology and the Roots of Modern Conflict''.

==Secular violence==

===Religion and secular===

According to John Carlson, excessive attention is often paid to acts of religious violence compared to acts of secular violence that do occur. This leads to a false essetializing of both religion as being prone to violence and the secular as being prone to peace, despite the abundant examples of secular violence that have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carlson |first1=John |editor1-last=Murphy |editor1-first=Andrew |title=The Blackwell Companion to Religion and Violence |date=2011 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=1405191317 |page=12 |chapter=1.

[[Hector Avalos]] argues that, because religions claim divine favor for themselves, over and against other groups, this sense of righteousness leads to violence because conflicting claims to superiority, based on unverifiable appeals to God, cannot be adjudicated objectively.&lt;ref name=FightingWords /&gt;

Similarly, Eric Hickey writes, "the history of religious violence in the West is as long as the historical record of its three major religions, [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], with their involved mutual antagonisms and their struggles to adapt and survive the secular forces that threaten their continued existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of murder and violent crime |first=Eric W. |last=Hickey |publisher=SAGE |year=2003 |page=217 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dDOW75aJMR8C&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=Judaism+Christianity+Islam+%22religious+violence%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Judaism%20Christianity%20Islam%20%22religious%20violence%22&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-7619-2437-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Regina Schwartz]] argues that all [[Monotheism|monotheistic religions]], including Christianity, are inherently violent because of an exclusivism that inevitably fosters violence against those who are considered outsiders.&lt;ref name=ReginaSchwartz /&gt; Lawrence Wechsler asserts that Schwartz isn't just arguing that Abrahamic religions have a violent legacy, but that the legacy is actually genocidal in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wechsler|first=Lawrence|title=Mayhem and Monotheism|url=http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/2490/PDF/mayhem.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720030355/http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/2490/PDF/mayhem.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce Feiler]] writes that "Jews and Christians who smugly console themselves by claiming that Islam is the only violent religion are willfully ignoring their past. Nowhere is the struggle between faith and violence described more vividly, and with more stomach-turning details of ruthlessness, than in the [[Hebrew Bible]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Where God was born: a journey by land to the roots of religion |first=Bruce S. |last=Feiler |publisher=HarperCollins|year=2005 |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aBVoWhUs-HoC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Judaism+%22violent+religion%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780060574871 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Tom O'Golo declares that religious [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalists]] who use violence to further their cause contravene the root truth of all faiths:
{{quote|A genuine fundamentalist is also a radical, someone who tries to get the root of the matter. A major weakness of many or perhaps of most radicals is not that they don't dig, but that they don't dig deep enough. Consequently many fundamentalists end up defending or acting upon beliefs which are not really at the heart of their doctrine. For example any religious fundamentalist who harms others in the pursuit of his or her radicalism is strictly out of order because no true religion ever encounters anything but love, tolerance and understanding. 'Thou shalt not kill' is at the heart of all genuine faiths, certainly the three based upon [[Abraham]] and [[God]]. That trio comprehensively condemns intentional harm to others (and to the self as well) for what ever reason. Dying to protect one's faith is acceptable; killing to promote it isn't. Arguably, it is blasphemous to say that God needs an earthly army to fight Its battles, or perform Its revenge. God is quite capable of fighting His own battles.&lt;ref name=Golo&gt;{{cite book|title=Christ? No! Jesus?

Before the 11th century, Christians had not developed a doctrine of "Holy war", whereby fighting itself might be considered a penitential and spiritually meritorious act.&lt;ref name="Peters First"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peters|first1=Edward|title=The First Crusade: The Chronicle of Fulcher of Chartres and Other Source Materials|date=1998|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=0812216563|edition=2|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duffey Christianity" /&gt; Throughout the Middle Ages, force could not be used to propagate religion.&lt;ref name="James Just War"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=James|editor1-last=Murphy|editor1-first=Andrew R.|title=The Blackwell Companion to Religion and Violence|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=1405191317|chapter=21. Just War and Jihad of the Sword}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first three centuries of Christianity, the Church taught the pacifism of Jesus and notable church fathers such as [[Justin Martyr]], [[Tertullian]], [[Origen]], and [[Cyprian|Cyprian of Carthage]] even went as far as arguing against joining the military or using any form of violence against aggressors.&lt;ref name="Duffey Christianity"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duffey|first1=Michael|editor1-last=Omar|editor1-first=Irfan|editor2-last=Duffey|editor2-first=Michael|title=Peacemaking and the Challenge of Violence in World Religions|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781118953426|chapter=2. Christianity: From Peacemaking to Violence to Home Again}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] developed a "Just War" concept, whereby limited uses of war would be considered acceptable in order to preserve the peace and retain orthodoxy if it was waged: for defensive purposes, ordered by an authority, had honorable intentions, and produced minimal harm. However, the criteria he used was already developed by Roman thinkers in the past and "Augustine's perspective was not based on the [[New Testament]]."&lt;ref name="Duffey Christianity" /&gt; St. Augustine's "Just War" concept was widely accepted, however, warfare was not regarded as virtuous in any way.&lt;ref name="Peters First" /&gt; Expression of concern for the salvation of those who killed enemies in battle, regardless of the cause for which they fought, was common.&lt;ref name="Peters First" /&gt; In the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] which began after the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]], there were increases in the level of violence due to political instability. By the 11th century, the Church condemned this violence and warring by introducing: the "Peace of God" which prohibited attacks on clergy, pilgrims, townspeople, peasants and property; the "Truce of God" which banned warfare on [[Sunday]]s, [[Friday]]s, [[Lent]], and [[Easter]]; and it imposed heavy penances on soldiers for killing and injuring others because it believed that the shedding of other people's blood was the same as shedding the blood of Christ.&lt;ref name="Duffey Christianity" /&gt;
         
During the 9th and 10th centuries, multiple invasions occurred in some regions in Europe and these invasions lead them to form their own armies in order to defend themselves and by the 11th century, this slowly lead to the emergence of the Crusades, the concept of "holy war", and terminology such as "enemies of God".&lt;ref name="Peters First" /&gt; By the time of the Crusades, "Despite all the violence during this period, the majority of Christians were not active participants but were more often its victims" and groups like the [[Franciscans]] were established which used nonviolent means to peacefully dialogue with Muslims.&lt;ref name="Duffey Christianity" /&gt;

Today the relationship between [[Christianity and violence]] is the subject of controversy because one view advocates the belief that Christianity advocates peace, love and compassion while it has also resorted to violence in certain instances.&lt;ref name=ReginaSchwartz/&gt;&lt;ref name=FightingWords&gt;{{cite book |title=Fighting Words: The Origins of Religious Violence |first=Hector |last=Avalos |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, New York |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VolfChristianityAndViolence&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CKaCWCDIKWsC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22Christianity+and+violence%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Christianity%20and%20violence%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon|chapter=Christianity and Violence|first=Miroslav|last=Volf|authorlink=Miroslav Volf|title=War in the Bible and terrorism in the twenty-first century |editor1-first=Richard S.|editor1-last=Hess|editor2-first=E.A.|editor2-last=Martens|publisher=Eisenbrauns|year=2008|isbn=978-1-57506-803-9|pages=1&amp;ndash;17|accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peace, compassion and forgiveness of wrongs done by others are key elements of Christian teaching. However, Christians have struggled since the days of the [[Church fathers]] with the question of when the use of force is justified (e.g. the [[Just war theory]] of Saint Augustine). Such debates have led to concepts such as just war theory. Throughout history, certain teachings from the [[Old Testament]], the [[New Testament]] and [[Christian theology]] have been used to justify the use of force against [[heretics]], [[sinners]] and external enemies. Heitman and Hagan identify the [[Inquisitions]], [[Crusades]], wars of religion, and [[antisemitism]] as being "among the most notorious examples of Christian violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International encyclopedia of violence research, Volume 2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sMNbcU7UnywC&amp;pg=PA323&amp;dq=Christianity+antisemitism+%22violent+religion%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Springer|year=2003|isbn=9781402014666}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this list, [[Mennonite]] theologian J. Denny Weaver adds "warrior popes, support of [[capital punishment]], [[corporal punishment]] under the guise of 'spare the rod spoil the child,' [[Christianity and slavery|justifications of slavery]], world-wide [[colonialism]] under the guise of converting people to Christianity, the systemic violence against women who are subjected to the rule of men".{{Synthesis inline|date=May 2011}} Weaver employs a broader definition of violence that extends the meaning of the word to cover "harm or damage", not just physical violence per se. Thus, under his definition, Christian violence includes "forms of systemic violence such as [[poverty]], [[racism]], and [[sexism]]".&lt;ref name=Weaver&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crosscurrents.org/weaver0701.htm#TEXT1|title=Violence in Christian Theology|accessdate=2010-10-27|publisher=Cross Currents|year=2001|author=J. Denny Weaver |quote=I am using broad definitions of the terms "violence" and "nonviolence". "Violence" means harm or damage, which obviously includes the direct violence of killing -- in war, capital punishment, murder --but also covers the range of forms of systemic violence such as poverty, racism, and sexism. "Nonviolence" also covers a spectrum of attitudes and actions, from the classic Mennonite idea of passive nonresistance through active nonviolence and nonviolent resistance that would include various kinds of social action, confrontations and the posing of alternatives that do not cause bodily harm or injury.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian theologians point to a strong [[doctrinal]] and historical imperative against violence that exists within Christianity, particularly [[Jesus]]' [[Sermon on the Mount]], which taught nonviolence and "love of enemies". For example, Weaver asserts that Jesus' pacifism was "preserved in the justifiable war doctrine which declares that all war is sin even when it is occasionally declared to be a necessary evil, and in the prohibition of fighting by monastics and clergy as well as in a persistent tradition of [[Christian pacifism]]".&lt;ref name=Weaver2&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crosscurrents.org/weaver0701.htm#TEXT1|title=Violence in Christian Theology|accessdate=2010-10-27|publisher=Cross Currents|year=2001|author=J.

Many authors highlight the ironical contradiction between Christianity's claims to be centered on "love and peace" while, at the same time, harboring a "violent side". For example, [[Mark Juergensmeyer]] argues: "that despite its central tenets of love and peace, Christianity&amp;mdash;like most traditions&amp;mdash;has always had a violent side. The bloody history of the tradition has provided images as disturbing as those provided by [[Islam]] or [[Sikhism]], and violent conflict is vividly portrayed in the Bible. This history and these biblical images have provided the raw material for theologically justifying the violence of contemporary Christian groups. For example, attacks on abortion clinics have been viewed not only as assaults on a practice that Christians regard as immoral, but also as skirmishes in a grand confrontation between forces of evil and good that has social and political implications.",&lt;ref name="mind"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence|author=Mark Juergensmeyer|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-24011-1|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|19–20}} sometimes referred to as [[spiritual warfare]]. The statement attributed to Jesus "I come not to bring peace, [[but to bring a sword]]" has been interpreted by some as a call to arms to Christians.&lt;ref name="mind"/&gt;

[[Maurice Bloch]] also argues that Christian faith fosters violence because Christian faith is a religion, and religions are by their very nature violent; moreover, he argues that religion and politics are two sides of the same coin&amp;mdash;power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bloch |first=Maurice|year=1992 |title=Prey into Hunter. The Politics of Religious Experience. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that religion and the exercise of force are deeply intertwined, but that religion may pacify, as well as channel and heighten violent impulses &lt;ref&gt;Andrew McKinnon.

[[File:ForwardwithGod.jpg|thumb|right|''Forward with God!'' (1915) by [[Boardman Robinson]].]]
In response to criticism that Christianity and violence are intertwined, Christian apologists such as Miroslav Volf and J. Denny Weaver reject charges that Christianity is a violent religion, arguing that certain aspects of Christianity might be misused to support violence but that a genuine interpretation of its core elements would not sanction human violence but would instead resist it. Among the examples that are commonly used to argue that Christianity is a violent religion, J. Denny Weaver lists "(the) crusades, the multiple blessings of wars, warrior popes, support for capital punishment, corporal punishment under the guise of 'spare the rod and spoil the child,' justifications of slavery, world-wide colonialism in the name of conversion to Christianity, the systemic violence of women subjected to men". Weaver characterizes the counter-argument as focusing on "Jesus, the beginning point of Christian faith,... whose Sermon on the Mount taught nonviolence and love of enemies,; who faced his accusers nonviolent death;whose nonviolent teaching inspired the first centuries of pacifist Christian history and was subsequently preserved in the justifiable war doctrine that declares all war as sin even when declaring it occasionally a necessary evil, and in the prohibition of fighting by monastics and clergy as well as in a persistent tradition of Christian pacifism."&lt;ref name=Weaver /&gt;

[[Miroslav Volf]] acknowledges that "many contemporaries see religion as a pernicious social ill that needs aggressive treatment rather than a medicine from which cure is expected." However, Volf contests this claim that "(the) Christian faith, as one of the major world religions, predominantly fosters violence." Instead of this negative assessment, Volf argues that Christianity "should be seen as a contributor to more peaceful social environments".&lt;ref name=BoardmanLecture&gt;{{cite web |url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=boardman|title=Christianity and Violence |first=Miroslav |last=Volf |year=2002 |accessdate=2010-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volf examines the question of whether Christianity fosters violence, and has identified four main arguments that it does: that religion by its nature is violent, which occurs when people try to act as "soldiers of God"; that monotheism entails violence, because a claim of universal truth divides people into "us versus them"; that creation, as in the [[Book of Genesis]], is an act of violence; and that the intervention of a "new creation", as in the [[Second Coming of Christ|Second Coming]], generates violence.&lt;ref name=VolfChristianityAndViolence /&gt; Writing about the latter, Volf says: "Beginning at least with Constantine's conversion, the followers of the Crucified have perpetrated gruesome acts of violence under the sign of the cross. Over the centuries, the seasons of Lent and Holy Week were, for the Jews, times of fear and trepidation; Christians have perpetrated some of the worst pogroms as they remembered the crucifixion of Christ, for which they blamed the Jews. Muslims also associate the cross with violence; crusaders' rampages were undertaken under the sign of the cross."&lt;ref name="Volf 2008 13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Volf|2008|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each case, Volf concluded that the Christian faith was misused in justifying violence. Volf argues that "thin" readings of Christianity might be used mischievously to support the use of violence. He counters, however, by asserting that "thick" readings of Christianity's core elements will not sanction human violence and would, in fact, resist it.&lt;ref name=VolfChristianityAndViolence2&gt;{{cite web|first=Miroslav |last=Volf |url=

Volf asserts that Christian churches suffer from a "confusion of loyalties". He asserts that "rather than the character of the Christian faith itself, a better explanation of why Christian churches are either impotent in the face of violent conflicts or actively participate in them derives from the proclivities of its adherents which are at odds with the character of the Christian faith." Volf observes that "(although) explicitly giving ultimate allegiance to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, many Christians in fact seem to have an overriding commitment to their respective cultures and ethnic groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Social Meaning of Reconciliation |first=Miroslav |last=Volf|url=http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Volf_The%20Social_June%201998.pdf |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mormonism====
{{Main|Mormonism and violence}}

[[Mormonism]] had an early history of violence. This began with religious persecution on the Mormons by well respected citizens, law enforcement, and government officials. Ultimately such persecution lead to several historically well-known acts of violence. These range from attacks on early Mormons, such as the [[Haun's Mill massacre]] following the [[Missouri Executive Order 44|Mormon Extermination Order]] to one of the most controversial and well-known cases of retaliation violence, the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]]. This was the result of an unprovoked response to religious persecution whereby an innocent party traveling through Mormon occupied territory was attacked on September 11, 1857.

[[Islam]] has been associated with violence in a variety of contexts, especially in the context of [[Jihad]]. In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the word ''jihād'' translates into English as "struggle". Jihad appears in the Qur'an and frequently in the idiomatic expression "striving in the way of [[Allah]] ''(al-jihad fi sabil Allah)''".&lt;ref name="Merriam"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor=[[Wendy Doniger]] | encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions | publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] | year=1999 |isbn=0-87779-044-2}},''Jihad'', p. 571&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MIC"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor=[[Josef W. Meri]] | encyclopedia=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia |publisher=[[Routledge]] | year=2005 | isbn=0-415-96690-6}}, ''Jihad'', p. 419&lt;/ref&gt; The context of the word can be seen in its usage in Arabic translations of the New Testament such as in 2 Timothy 4:7 where St. Paul expresses keeping the faith after many struggles.&lt;ref name="Omar Islam" /&gt; A person engaged in jihad is called a ''[[mujahid]]''; the plural is [[mujahideen]]. Jihad is an important religious duty for Muslims. A minority among the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni scholars]] sometimes refer to this duty as the sixth [[Five Pillars of Islam|pillar of Islam]], though it occupies no such official status.&lt;ref name="jih"&gt;[[John Esposito]](2005), ''Islam: The Straight Path,'' p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Twelver]] [[Shi'a Islam]], however, Jihad is one of the ten [[Practices of the Religion]].

The tension reached a climax on [[September 11th, 2001]] when Islamic terrorists flew hijacked commercial airplanes into the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in New York City and [[The Pentagon]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The “[[War on Terror]]” has triggered [[Islamophobia|anti-Muslim sentiments]] within [[Christendom]] and throughout the rest of the world. [[Al-Qaeda]] is one of the most well known Islamic extremist groups, created by [[Osama bin Laden|Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden]]. Al-Qaeda's goal is to spread the “purest” form of Islam and [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. Based on his interpretation of the Quran, bin Laden needed to do “good” by inflicting terror upon millions of people. Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, bin Laden praised the suicide bombers in his [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/specials/attacked/transcripts/binladentext_121301.html statement]: ''“the great action you did which was first and foremost by the grace of [[Allah]]. This is the guidance of Allah and the blessed fruit of jihad”''. In contrast, echoing the overwhelming majority of people who interpreted these events, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] said on September 11, ''"Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward... And freedom will be defended. Make no mistake, the United States will hunt down and punish those responsible for these cowardly acts."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=George W.

Controversies surrounding the subject include disagreements over whether terrorist acts are self-defense or aggression, national self-determination or Islamic supremacy; whether Islam can ever condone the targeting of non-combatants; whether some attacks described as Islamic terrorism are merely terrorist acts committed by Muslims or terrorist acts motivated by nationalism; whether [[Zionism]] and the [[Arab-Israeli Conflict]] are at the root of Islamic terrorism, or simply one cause of it; how much support for Islamic terrorism exists in the Muslim world&lt;ref&gt;Tony Blair, "Speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council", {{cite web |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page9948.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060815061152/http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page9948.asp |archivedate=2006-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and whether support of terrorism is only a temporary phenomenon, a "bubble", now fading away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Third Bubble |author=Thomas L.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Judaism and violence}}

Burggraeve and Vervenne describe the Old Testament as full of violence and as evidence of both a violent society and a violent god. They write that, "(i)n numerous Old Testament texts the power and glory of Israel's God is described in the language of violence." They assert that more than one thousand passages refer to [[Yahweh|YHWH]] as acting violently or supporting the violence of humans and that more than one hundred passages involve divine commands to kill humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Swords into plowshares: theological reflections on peace |first1=Roger |last1=Burggraeve|first2=Marc |last2=Vervenne |publisher=Peeters Publishers |year=1991 |pages=82,109 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=q8KvY0W58eYC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=%22violent+God%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22violent%20God%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9789068313727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of these passages in the [[Old Testament]], some Christian churches and theologians argue that Judaism is a violent religion and that the god of Israel is a violent god. Reuven Firestone asserts that these assertions are usually made in the context of claims that Christianity is a religion of peace and that the god of Christianity is one who only expresses love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Beyond violence: religious sources of social transformation in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam |editor=Heft, James |publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rxiINuHNAIUC&amp;pg=PT96&amp;dq=Judaism+%22violent+religion%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Judaism%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9780823223350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars such as Deborah Weissman readily acknowledge that "normative Judaism is not pacifist" and that "violence is condoned in the service of self-defense."However, the Talmud prohibits violence of any kind towards one's neighbour. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Co-existence of Violence and Non-Violence in Judaism|url=http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/what/interreligious/cd39-07.html |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; J. Patout Burns asserts that, although Judaism condones the use of violence in certain cases, Jewish tradition clearly posits the principle of minimization of violence. This principle can be stated as "(wherever) Jewish law allows violence to keep an evil from occurring, it mandates that the minimal amount of violence must be used in order to accomplish one's goal." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War and its discontents: pacifism and quietism in the Abrahamic traditions |first=J. Patout |last=Burns|publisher=Georgetown University Press |year=1996 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The love of peace and the pursuit of peace, as well as laws requiring the eradication of evil, sometimes using violent means, co-exist in the Jewish tradition.&lt;ref name="Broyde"&gt;Fighting the War and the Peace: Battlefield Ethics, Peace Talks, Treaties, and Pacifism in the Jewish Tradition.

&lt;/ref&gt; because the [[Torah]] states that the Israelites annihilated entire ethnic groups or tribes: the Israelites killed all Amalekites, including men, women, and children ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+15%3A1-20&amp;version=NIV 1 Samuel 15:1–20]); the Israelites killed all men, women, and children in [[The Battle of Jericho|the battle of Jericho]]([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=joshua+6%3A15-21&amp;version=NIV Joshua 6:15–21]), and the Israelites killed all men, women and children of several Canaanite tribes ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=joshua+10%3A28-42&amp;version=NIV Joshua 10:28–42]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Handbook of Genocide Studies'',  Donald Bloxham, A. Dirk Moses, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scholars{{Who|date=May 2015}} believe that these accounts in the Torah are exaggerated or metaphorical.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[Zionism|Zionist]] leaders sometimes used religious references as a justification for the violent treatment of [[Arabs]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;
Saleh Abdel Jawad (2007) "Zionist Massacres: the Creation of the Palestinian Refugee Problem in the 1948 War" in ''Israel and the Palestinian refugees'', Eyal Benvenistî, Chaim Gans, Sari Hanafi (Eds.), Springer, p. 78:
:".. the Zionist movement, which claims to be secular, found it necessary to embrace the idea of 'the promised land' of Old Testament prophecy, to justify the confiscation of land and the expulsion of the [[Palestinians]]. For example, the speeches and letters of [[Chaim Weizman]], the secular Zionist leader, are filled with references to the biblical origins of the Jewish claim to Palestine, which he often mixes liberally with more pragmatic and nationalistic claims. By the use of this premise, embraced in 1937, Zionists alleged that the Palestinians were usurpers in the Promised Land, and therefore their expulsion and death was justified. The Jewish-American writer Dan Kurzman, in his book ''Genesis 1948'' ... describes the view of one of the Deir Yassin's killers: 'The Sternists followed the instructions of the Bible more rigidly than others. They honored the passage (Exodus 22:2): 'If a thief be found ...' This meant, of course, that killing a thief was not really murder. And were not the enemies of Zionism thieves, who wanted to steal from the Jews what God had granted them?' ''

&lt;/ref&gt; On several occasions, Palestinians have been associated with Biblical antagonists, the Amalekites. For example, [[Rabbi]] [[Israel Hess]] has recommended that Palestinians be killed, based on biblical verses such as 1 Samuel 15.&lt;ref&gt;

"Frequently Jewish fundamentalists refer to the Palestinians as the 'Amalekites' ... of today.... According to the Old Testament, the Amalek ... were regarded as the Israelites' inveterate foe, whose 'annihilation' became a sacred duty and against whom war should be waged until their 'memory be blotted out' forever (Ex 17:16; Deut 25:17–19).... Some of the [modern] political messianics insist on giving the biblical commandment to 'blot out the memory of the Amalek' an actual contemporary relevance in the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians. In February 1980, Rabbi [[Israel Hess]] ... published an article [titled] 'The Genocide Commandment in the Torah' ... which ends with the following: 'The day is not far when we shall all be called to this holy war, this commandment of the annihilation of the Amalek'. Hess quotes the biblical commandment ... 'Do not spare him, but kill man and woman, baby and suckling, ox and sheep, camel, and donkey'.... In his book ''On the Lord's Side'' Danny Rubinstein has shown that this notion permeates the [[Gush Emunim]] movement's bulletins [one of which] carried an article ... which reads 'In every generation there is an Amalek.... The Amalekism of our generation finds expression in the deep Arab hatred towards our national revival ...'... Professor Uriel Tal ... conducted his study in the early 1980s ... and pointed out that the totalitarian political messianic stream refers to the Palestinian Arabs in three stages or degrees: ... [stage] (3) the implementation of the commandment of Amalek, as expressed in Rabbi Hess's article 'The Commandment of Genocide in the Torah', in other words 'annihilating' the Palestinian Arabs'"}}

==Conflicts and wars==

{{Main|Religious war}}

It has been noted that "religious" conflicts are not exclusively based on religious beliefs but should instead be seen as clashes of communities, identities, and interests that are secular-religious or at least very secular.&lt;ref name="Anthropology of Religion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Irrational Atheist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dying to Win" /&gt;

Some have asserted that attacks are carried out by those with very strong religious convictions such as terrorists in the context of global religious war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/11-24-2002-30919.asp Full text: bin Laden's 'letter to America'] accessed may 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Pape, a political scientist who specializes in [[suicide terrorism]] argues that much of the modern Muslim suicide terrorism is secularly based.&lt;ref name="Dying to Win" /&gt; Although the causes of terrorism are complex, it may be safe to assume that terrorists are partially reassured by the religious views that God is on their side and that He will reward them in [[Heaven]] for punishing unbelievers.&lt;ref name=juerg /&gt;&lt;ref name=chrjhd&gt;[http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/ChurchAndMinistry/ChurchHistory/Crusades_CanerChristianJihad0505.asp Christian Jihad: The Crusades and Killing in the Name of Christ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709000007/http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/ChurchAndMinistry/ChurchHistory/Crusades_CanerChristianJihad0505.asp |date=2008-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These conflicts are among the most difficult to resolve, particularly when both sides believe that God is on their side and that He has endorsed the moral righteousness of their claims.&lt;ref name=juerg&gt;{{Cite book| last =Juergensmeyer  | first =Mark | authorlink = | title = Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence.

==Ritual violence==
{{Further|ritual slaughter|human sacrifice|animal sacrifice}}
Ritual violence may be directed against victims (e.g., [[human]] and nonhuman [[animal sacrifice]] and [[ritual slaughter]]) or self-inflicted ([[Self-flagellation#Association with religion|religious self-flagellation]]).

According to the [[hunting hypothesis]], created by [[Walter Burkert]] in ''[[Homo Necans]]'', [[carnivorous]] behavior is considered a form of violence. Burkett suggests that the anthropological phenomenon of [[religion]] grew out of rituals that were connected with [[hunting]] and the associated feelings of guilt over the violence that hunting required.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, Walter. 1983.

'''Salutogenesis''' is a term coined by [[Aaron Antonovsky]],&lt;ref name=Antonovsky1979&gt;Antonovsky, A. "Health, Stress and Coping" San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; a professor of [[medical sociology]].  The term describes an approach focusing on factors that support human health and well-being, rather than on factors that cause disease ([[pathogenesis]]). More specifically, the "salutogenic model" is concerned with the relationship between [[health]], [[stress (physiology)|stress]], and [[Coping (psychology)|coping]].

Antonovsky's theories reject the "traditional medical-model [[dichotomy]] separating health and illness". He described the relationship as a continuous variable, what he called the "''health-ease'' versus ''dis-ease'' continuum".&lt;ref name=Antonovsky1979/&gt;

==Derivation==
The word "salutogenesis" comes from the Latin ''salus'' = health and the Greek ''genesis'' = origin. Antonovsky developed the term from his studies of "how people manage stress and stay well"&lt;ref name=Antonovsky1987&gt;Antonovsky, A. Unraveling The Mystery of Health - How People Manage Stress and Stay Well, San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; (unlike [[pathogenesis]] which studies the causes of diseases). He observed that stress is ubiquitous, but not all individuals have negative health outcomes in response to stress. Instead, some people achieve health despite their exposure to potentially disabling stress factors.

In his 1979 book, ''Health, Stress and Coping'',  Antonovsky described a variety of influences that led him to the question of how people survive, adapt, and overcome in the face of even the most punishing life-stress experiences. In his 1987 book, ''Unraveling the Mysteries of Health'', he focused more specifically on a study of women and aging; he found that 29% of women who had survived [[Nazi concentration camps]] had positive emotional health, compared to 51% of a control group. His insight was that  29% of the survivors were ''not'' emotionally impaired  by the stress. Antonovsky wrote: "this for me was the dramatic experience that consciously set me on the road to formulating what I came to call the 'salutogenic model'."&lt;ref name=Antonovsky1987/&gt;

In salutogenic theory, people continually battle with the effects of hardship. These ubiquitous forces are called ''generalized resource deficits'' (GRDs). On the other hand, there are ''generalized resistance resources'' (GRRs), which are all of the resources that help a person cope and are effective in avoiding or combating a range of psychosocial stressors. Examples are resources such as money, ego-strength, and social support.

''Generalized resource deficits'' will cause the coping mechanisms to fail whenever the [[Salutogenesis#Sense of coherence|sense of coherence]] is not robust to weather the current situation. This causes illness and possibly even death. However, if the sense of coherence is high, a stressor will not necessarily be harmful. But it is the balance between ''generalized resource deficits'' and ''resources'' that determines whether a factor will be pathogenic, neutral, or salutary.&lt;ref name=Antonovsky1979/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Antonovsky|first=Aaron|title=Unravelling the Mystery of Health|year=1987|publisher=Jossey-Bass Inc.|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antonovsky's formulation was that the ''generalized resistance resources'' enabled individuals to make sense of and manage events. He argued that over time, in response to positive experiences provided by successful use of different resources, an individual would develop an attitude that was "in itself the essential tool for coping".&lt;ref name=Antonovsky1979/&gt;

== Sense of coherence ==

The "sense of coherence" is a theoretical formulation that provides a central explanation for the role of stress in human functioning. "Beyond the specific stress factors that one might encounter in life, and beyond your perception and response to those events, what determines whether stress will cause you harm is whether or not the stress violates your sense of coherence."&lt;ref&gt;At everydaypsychology.com: [http://everydaypsychology.com/2007/04/sense-of-coherence.html The Sense of Coherence]&lt;/ref&gt; Antonovsky defined Sense of Coherence as:&lt;ref name=Antonovsky1987/&gt;&lt;ref name=Antonovsky1990&gt;Antonovsky, Aaron. Studying Health vs. Studying Disease,  Lecture at the Congress for Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Berlin, 19 February 1990. [http://www.ensp.unl.pt/saboga/soc/pulic/soc_AAconference_berlim_91.pdf available online] from  the Universidade Nova de Lisboa&lt;/ref&gt;

: "a global orientation that expresses the extent to which one has a pervasive, enduring though dynamic feeling of confidence that (1) the stimuli deriving from one's internal and external environments in the course of living are structured, predictable and explicable; (2) the resources are available to one to meet the demands posed by these stimuli; and (3) these demands are challenges, worthy of investment and engagement." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Antonovsky|first=Aaron|title=Unravelling the mystery of health|year=1987|publisher=Josey Bass Publishers|isbn=978-1-55542-028-4|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his formulation, the sense of coherence has three components:
* ''Comprehensibility'':  a belief that things happen in an orderly and predictable fashion and a sense that you can understand events in your life and reasonably predict what will happen in the future.
* ''Manageability'': a belief that you have the skills or ability, the support, the help, or the resources necessary to take care of things,  and that things are manageable and within your control.
* ''Meaningfulness'': a belief that things in life are interesting and a source of satisfaction,  that things are really worthwhile and that there is good reason or purpose to care about what happens.
According to Antonovsky,  the third element is the most important. If a person believes there is no reason to persist and survive and confront challenges, if they have no sense of meaning, then they will have no motivation to comprehend and manage events.  His essential argument is that "salutogenesis" depends on experiencing a strong "sense of coherence".  His research demonstrated that the sense of coherence predicts positive health outcomes.

== Fields of application ==

=== Health and medicine ===
Antonovsky viewed his work as primarily addressed to the fields of [[health psychology]], [[behavioral medicine]], and the sociology of health.&lt;ref name=Antonovsky1987/&gt; The term has been adopted in the [[medical]] fields of [[healthcare]] and [[preventive medicine]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} It has also been adopted as a term to describe contemporary approaches to nursing,&lt;ref&gt;England, M., &amp; Artinian, B. (1996). Salutogenic Psychosocial Nursing Practice. Journal of Holistic Nursing, 14(3), 147-195.&lt;/ref&gt; psychiatry,&lt;ref&gt;Bergstein, M., Weizman, A., &amp; Solomon, Z. (2008). Sense of Coherence Among Delusional Patients: Prediction of Remission and Risk of Relapse. Comprehensive Psychiatry, 49, 288-296.&lt;/ref&gt; and healthcare architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Dilani, A. P. D.

=== Workplace ===
The sense of coherence with its three components meaningfulness, manageability and understandability has also been applied to the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Gregor J. Jenny, Georg F. Bauer, Hege Forbech Vinje, Katharina Vogt, Steffen Torp, ''The Application of Salutogenesis to Work''. In: ''The Handbook of Salutogenesis'', 3 September 2016, pp. 197-210. DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-04600-6_20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22184959"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Piotrowicz M, Cianciara D |title=[Salutogenesis--new approach to health and disease] |language=Polish |journal=Przeglad Epidemiologiczny |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=521–7 |year=2011 |pmid=22184959 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Meaningfulness'' is considered to be related to the feeling of participation and motivation and to a perceived meaning of the work.&lt;ref name="lindmark-etal"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=U. Lindmark, P. Wagman, C. Wåhlin, B. Rolander|title=Workplace health in dental care – a salutogenic approach|journal=International Journal of Dental Hygiene|volume=16|issue=1|pages=103–113|doi=10.1111/idh.12257|pmid=27860378|pmc=5811775|date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''meaningfulness'' component has also been linked with [[Job control (workplace)|Job control]] and with task significance. Job control implies that employees have more authority to make decisions concerning their work and the working process. Task significance involves "the experience of congruence between personal [[Value (ethics)|values]] and work activities, which is accompanied by strong feelings of identification with the attitudes, values or goals of the working tasks and feelings of [[motivation]] and involvement".&lt;ref name="BauerJenny2013-p81"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Georg F. Bauer|author2=Gregor J. Jenny|title=Salutogenic organizations and change: The concepts behind organizational health intervention research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRBAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81|date=1 July 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-007-6470-5|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''manageability'' component is considered to be linked to job control as well as to access to resources.&lt;ref name="lindmark-etal"/&gt; It has also been considered to be linked with [[social skill]]s and [[Trust (emotion)|trust]]. [[Social relation]]s relate also to the ''meaningfulness'' component.&lt;ref name="BauerJenny2013-p82"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Georg F. Bauer|author2=Gregor J. Jenny|title=Salutogenic organizations and change: The concepts behind organizational health intervention research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRBAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82|date=1 July 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-007-6470-5|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''comprehensibility'' component may be influenced by consistent feedback at work,&lt;ref name="BauerJenny2013-p82"/&gt; for example concerning the [[performance appraisal]].

'''Statistical finance''',&lt;ref&gt;J-P Bouchaud, An introduction to Statistical Finance, Physica A 313 (2002) 238&amp;ndash;251&lt;/ref&gt; is the application of [[econophysics]]&lt;ref&gt;V. Perou, E. Gopikrishnan, L A Amaral, M. Meyer, H. E. Stanley, Phys. Rev. E 60 6519 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; to [[financial market]]s. Instead of the [[Normative economics|normative]] roots of much of the field of [[finance]], it uses a [[positivist]] framework including exemplars from [[statistical physics]] with an emphasis on emergent or collective properties of financial markets. The starting point for this approach to understanding financial markets are the empirically observed [[stylized fact]]s.

==Stylized facts ==

# Stock markets are characterised by bursts of price volatility.
# Price changes are less volatile in bull markets and more volatile in bear markets.
# Price change correlations are stronger with higher volatility, and their auto-correlations die out quickly.
# Almost all real data have more extreme events than suspected.
# Volatility correlations decay slowly.
# Trading volumes have memory the same way that volatilities do.
# Past price changes are negatively correlated with future volatilities.

== Research objectives ==

Statistical finance is focused on three areas:

# Empirical studies focused on the discovery of interesting statistical features of financial time-series data aimed at extending and consolidating the known [[stylized fact]]s.
# The use of these discoveries to build and implement models that better price derivatives and anticipate stock price movement with an emphasis on [[non-Gaussian]] methods and models.
# The study of collective and emergent behaviour in simulated and real markets to uncover the mechanisms responsible for the observed stylized facts with an emphasis on [[agent-based model]]s.

It is noteworthy that [[financial econometrics]] also has a focus on the first two of these three areas. However, there is almost no overlap or interaction between the community of statistical finance researchers (who typically publish in physics journals) and the community of financial econometrics researchers (who typically publish in economics journals).

== Behavioral finance and statistical finance ==

Behavioural finance attempts to explain price anomalies in terms of the biased behaviour of individuals, mostly concerned with the agents themselves and to a lesser degree aggregation of agent behaviour. Statistical finance is concerned with emergent properties arising from systems with many interacting agents and as such attempts to explain price anomalies in terms of the collective behaviour. Emergent properties are largely independent of the uniqueness of individual agents because they are dependent on the nature of the interactions of the agents rather than the agents themselves. This approach has drawn strongly on ideas arising from [[complex systems]], [[phase transitions]],  [[Critical phenomena|criticality]], [[self-organized criticality]], non-extensivity (see [[Tsallis entropy]]), q-Gaussian models,  and agents based models (see [[agent based model]]); as these are known to be able to recover some of phenomenology of financial market data, the [[stylized fact]]s, in particular the [[long-range memory]] and scaling due to long-range interactions.

== Criticism ==

Within the subject the description of financial markets blindly in terms of models of statistical physics has been argued as flawed because it has transpired these do not fully correspond to what we now know about real finance markets. First, traders create largely noise, not long range correlations among themselves, except when they all buy or all sell, such as during a popular IPO or during a crash.  A market is not at an equilibrium critical point, the resulting non-equilibrium market must reflect details of traders' interactions (universality applies only to a limited very class of bifurcations, and the market does not sit at a bifurcation). Even if the notion of a thermodynamics equilibrium is considered not at the level of the agents but in terms of collections of instruments stable configurations are not observed. The market does not 'self-organize' into a stable statistical equilibrium, rather, markets are unstable. Although markets could be 'self-organizing' in the sense used by [[finite-time singularity]] models these models are difficult to falsify. Although Complex systems have never been defined in a broad sense financial markets do satisfy reasonable criterion of being considered complex adaptive systems.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Market Complexity, Johnson, Jefferies and Hui, Oxford 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Tallis doctrine has been put into question as it is apparently a special case of markov dynamics so questioning the very notion of a "non-linear Fokker-Plank equation". In addition, the standard 'stylized facts' of financial markets, fat tails, scaling, and universality are not observed in real FX markets even if they are observed in equity markets.

From outside the subject the approach has been considered by many as a dangerous view of finance which has drawn criticism from some [[heterodox economics|heterodox economists]] because of:&lt;ref&gt;[[Mauro Gallegati]], [[Steve Keen]], [[Thomas Lux]] and [[Paul Ormerod]], ''Worrying Trends in Econophysics'', [[Physica A]] '''370''', 1-6 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; 
# "A lack of awareness of work which has been done within economics itself."
# "Resistance to more rigorous and robust statistical methodology."
# "The belief that universal empirical regularities can be found in many areas of economic activity."
# "The theoretical models which are being used to explain empirical phenomena."
In response to these criticism there are claims of a general maturing of these non-traditional empirical approaches to Finance.&lt;ref&gt;"Response to worrying trends in econophysics", McCauley, J. L. Physica A 2.371(2006): pp. 601&amp;ndash;609 http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/2129/1/MPRA_paper_2129.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This defense of the subject does not flatter the use of physics metaphors but does defend the alternative empirical approach of "econophysics" itself.

Some of the key data claims have been questioned in terms of methods of data analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin E. Bassler, Joseph L. McCauley, and Gemunu H. Gunaratne, Nonstationary increments, scaling distributions, and variable diffusion processes in financial markets, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 104, 17287-17290 (2007). http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0708664104&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the ideas arising from nonlinear sciences and statistical physics have been helpful in shifting our understanding financial markets, and may yet be found useful, but the particular requirements of stochastic analysis to the specific models useful in finance is apparently unique to finance as a subject. There is much lacking in this approach to finance yet it would appear that the canonical approach to finance based optimization of individual behaviour given information and preferences with assumptions to allow aggregation in equilibrium are even more problematic.

It has been suggested that what is required is a change in mindset within finance and economics that moves the field towards methods of natural science.&lt;ref&gt;J-P. Bouchaud, Economics needs a scientific revolution https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.5306v1&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps finance needs to be thought of more as an observational science where markets are observed in the same way as the observable universe in cosmology, or the observable ecosystems in the environmental sciences. Here local principles can be uncovered by local experiments but meaningful global experiments are difficult to envision as feasible without reproducing the system being observed. The required science becomes that based largely on pluralism (see [[scientific pluralism]] the view that some phenomena observed in science require multiple explanations to account for their nature), as in most sciences that deal with complexity, rather than a singled unified mathematical framework that is to be verified by experiment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20581">[[Image:Maxschelerphoto.jpg|thumb|Max Scheler (1874–1928)]]
[[Max Scheler]] (1874–1928) was an early 20th-century German Continental philosopher in the phenomenological tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Max Scheler, Selected Philosophical Essays. Trans. David R. Lachterman. “The Idols of Self-Knowledge,” “Ordo Amoris,” “Phenomenology and the Theory of Cognition,” “The Theory of Three Facts,” and “Idealism and Realism” (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973) editor’s introduction, pp. xi-xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scheler's style of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] has been described by some scholars as “applied phenomenology”: an appeal to facts or “things in themselves” as always furnishing a descriptive basis for speculative philosophical concepts. One key source of just such a pattern of facts is expressed in Scheler’s descriptive mapping of human emotional life (the “Stratification of Emotional Life”) as articulated in his seminal 1913–1916 work, Formalism in Ethics and Non-Formal Ethics of Values.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred S. Frings, Max Scheler: A Concise Introduction into the World of a Great Thinker (Milwaukee: Marquette University Press, 1996), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
{{Original research|date=January 2009}}
The practical significance of Scheler's Stratification of Emotional Life is obvious in several respects and points of view.

First, Scheler seems to be making a case in favor of what we might refer to today as [[Emotional Intelligence]], as a portal to more ethical behavior and optimum personal development, similar to the ancient Greek concern for promoting virtuous character.&lt;ref&gt;Max Scheler “Ordo Amoris”, in Selected Philosophical Essays, trans. David R. Lachterman (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973), pp. 103-104. See also Plato’s Republic (the Soul).&lt;/ref&gt;  However quite unlike many of our modern attitudes and prejudices, emotional life ought '''''not''''' be viewed as simply a chaotic impediment to reason, but rather should be understood as a sort of “sixth sense” having an informative objective core: what Scheler termed our ''Ordo Amoris'' (or “Logic of the Heart”).&lt;ref&gt;“Ordo Amoris”, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, for Scheler values have true primacy as real inherent ''qualities'' discovered in things, people, situations and the like. Values and immanent emotive experience are co-extensive: “the plain fact is that we act vis-à-vis values just as we do vis-à-vis colors and sounds.” &lt;ref&gt;Max Scheler, Formalism in Ethics and Non-Formal Ethics of Values, trans. Manfred S. Frings and Richard L. Funk (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Scheler's claim is that the correlates of feelings and emotions are ''values'', just as the correlates of visual perception are ''colors'' and audio perceptions are ''sounds''. If such qualities are present in a person's world, they tend to be apprehended. But the reverse is also true: the meanings ascribed to things, people, situations and the like are uniquely co-extensive with the subjective relativity of every ''person'', as the "totality of acts of different kinds" &lt;ref&gt;Formalism, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; having a unique qualitative direction &lt;ref&gt;Formalism, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; and destiny.&lt;ref&gt;"Ordo Amoris", p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; As a value being and bearer of values every person is as unique as a snowflake. This is why Scheler's ethics is commonly referred as a [[Material Value-Ethics]] as opposed to a formal ethics ([[Immanuel Kant]]).

Third, values are emotively intuited. The ''whole'' of "something" is intuited by consciousness before any of the ''parts'' can fully be rationally known or assimilated. Common expressions such as "ah ha", "love at first sight," ''déjà vu'' or "the cat's pajamas" sum up this basic idea. Values are realized though personal apprehensions (i.e. "attractions" and "repulsions") of positive (and negative) qualities discoverable through our own pre-thought, pre-willed acts of ''preference''.&lt;ref&gt;Max Scheler, The Nature of Sympathy, trans. Peter Heath (Hamden: Shoe Sting Press, 1973), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth, depth of emotion signals importance (intensity) of value, just as absence of feeling signals the lack. This depth structure found in emotive life correlates reciprocally to Scheler’s formulation of an upward vertical ''apriori'' hierarchy of values as forming the basis of an intuitive ethics inspired by love,&lt;ref&gt;Sympathy, p. 157 &amp; 161.  For Scheler, the introduction of Christian Love in history validated loving those perceived as “lower” in stature than oneself, (i.e., the needy, the affirmed, the socially exploited and rejected, the different) in contrast to the classical Greek and Roman love which focused only what is higher or more powerful. With Christian love, our aiming higher leads to God which in turn leads to compassion and acceptance toward others and the world unlike ourselves as a work in progress, struggling and less than perfect, but beautiful and valued nonetheless.  See also “Frings” pp. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt; emanating ultimately from the ''Divine''.&lt;ref&gt;Sympathy, Chapter 11; “Ordo Amoris”, pp. 105-108; Formalism, p. 294. Also see Max Scheler, On the Eternal in Man.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scheler's analysis of the strata of emotive life ==
For Scheler, human feelings, feeling states and emotions display a meaningful and progressive pattern of levels from our peripheral to the deeper more stable structures of personality.&lt;ref&gt;Formalism, p. 336.
&lt;/ref&gt; Scheler identified four &lt;ref&gt;Some Scholars focusing on Scheler’s later writings have come to posit a fifth value modality, values of utility, located between sensible and vital values.  This is a debatable point as many scholars believe that Scheler never retraced his early formulations on the emotions and values. Also, in his early works Scheler did not identify a distinct class of feelings, feeling states or emotions associated with utility. In fact, Scheler maintained that the values of the useful always served values of the agreeable (Formalism., p. 94). Utility may very well better be interpreted and assimilated as a highly developed dimension of Vital Urge.
&lt;/ref&gt; distinct but interrelated strata found in human emotional life.&lt;ref&gt;Formalism, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

At our most periphery we have '''sensible feelings''' (e.g., a tickle, an itch, a fragrance, a taste, pleasure, pain, hunger, thirst, intoxication…), which manifest in relative modes of joy and suffering.  These feelings are shortest in duration, extended and localizable with reference to the lived-body, and are the most readily alterable and accessible through external means and stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Formalism, pp. 333-338.&lt;/ref&gt;

Next we have '''vital feelings''' or feeling states of the unitary lived-body which are experienced as a unified field or whole (e.g., comfort, health, vigor, strength, tiredness, illness, weakness, advancing age, [[phantom limb]] phenomenon…), and which manifest intentionally as fear and hope.&lt;ref&gt;Formalism, pp. 338-342 &amp; 335. Fear as a negative vital influence has the usual effect of blocking higher thought processes of the psychic level.&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining two strata of the emotive map belongs to the realm of individual personhood because these emotions transcend (or at least exceed) the physical restrictions of lived-body and environment; they are the least subject to arbitrary alteration; and they are also by their very nature communicable and social in character.

These are, first, the purely '''psychic feeling states''' or emotions having a characteristically ego-quality (e.g., euphoria, happiness, sympathy, enjoyment, sadness, sorrow, anger, jealousy…), and which manifest intentionally as empathy, preferring, loving, hating and willing.&lt;ref&gt;Formalism, p. 342 &amp; 336.&lt;/ref&gt; As representing one’s prevalent mental disposition it is important to note that psychic feeling states are alterable though acts of free will, thought and positive social interactions.

Finally, Scheler identifies '''spiritual feelings''' which differ sharply from personal psychic feeling states in that “all ego-states seem to be extinguished… [and such emotions] take possession of the whole of our being.”&lt;ref&gt;Formalism, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., bliss, awe, wonder, catharsis, despair, shame, remorse, anxiety, pangs of conscience, grief…). These types of emotions overtake and overcome us, usually quite unexpectedly.  We can not reason or will to produce such spiritual feelings.  As positive experiences, we can only open our hearts and mind and hope that they find us.

The intentional arch of positive feelings and feeling states ultimately spans from the sensible to the spiritual, or from a sort of “hedonistic nihilism” to deeper levels of personal contentment.&lt;ref&gt;Formalism, p. 331.  Also, see Formalism, Part II, Chapter 9 (b) “All Volitional Direction toward the Realization of Positive and Comparatively Higher Values Originally Arise from Positive Feeling-States and Sources." Note, that all experience of positive feelings and felling states always inherently point and inform directionally toward yet higher values with their attendant feelings and feeling states.  All positive feelings and feeling states precipitate awareness of yet higher value and feeling strata. Positive spiritual feelings particularly can serve a function of returning the person back onto their world with renewed perspective and energy.&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite is true for negative feeling and feeling states.&lt;ref&gt;Max Scheler, Ressentiment, trans. William H. Holdheim (New York: Noonday, 1973), pp. 23-26.  Also, see Formalism, Part II, and Chapter 9 (a) "The Law of the Tendency toward Surrogates When a “Deeper” Emotional Determination of the Ego Is Negative." When personal progress becomes stagnant or frustrated in moving from a negative to a more positive plateau given a relatively high vital or psychic level of value attainment, there is an inherent tendency toward regression in terms of indulgence in traditional vices. This tendency might be termed as the transcendable (self-medicating) condition of mans "inherent moral weakness." In its extreme form this tendency can lend itself toward '''ressentiment'''. In literature this tendency is akin to the concept of "[[tragic flaw]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

== The connection between emotive life and value modalities ==
The structure of Scheler's stratification model of emotive life correlates to the inherent spectral type structure of value rankings, or what Scheler termed the  '''''apriori'' hierarchy of value modalities'''.&lt;ref&gt;Formalism, Part I, Chapter 2, Section 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Our earlier analogy to color perception illustrates this point. Just as all colors we intuit (see) are derivative of the pure spectrum or hues as when pure ("white") light is refracted through a prism, so too all intuited (felt) values are derivative of the '''''apriori'' hierarchy of value modalities''' as when ''Divine'' love is apprehended through a purely ordered heart ('''''Ordo Amoris''''').

Scheler's claim is that these value modalities are  constant and unchanging throughout history, forming a basis for objective non-formal ethics.  From lowest to highest these modalities (with their respective positive and corresponding negative dis-value forms) are as follows: '''''sensual values''''' of the '''agreeable''' and the '''disagreeable'''; '''''vital values''''' of the '''noble''' and '''vulgar'''; '''''mental (psychic) values''''' of the '''beautiful''' and '''ugly''', '''right''' and '''wrong''' and '''truth''' and '''falsehood'''; and finally '''''values of the Holy and Unholy''''' of the '''Divine''' and '''Idols'''.&lt;ref&gt;Formalism, Part I, Chapter 2-B (5) “A Priori Relations of Rank among Value-Modalities".&lt;/ref&gt;

                       
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Values hiearchy.jpg|Click on to Enlarge
Image:Emotion value correlation.jpg|Click on to Enlarge
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The [[logical consequence|logical implication]] of all the above is that human beings will naturally prefer a positive value (i.e., value situation) over a negative value (or dis-value), such as when life seems to tragically descend in a self-perpetuating spiral of negative emotions (envy, anger, jealousy, spite, hate, revenge)--a psycho-philosophical problematic termed '''''[[Ressentiment]]'''''. Furthermore, human beings will naturally prefer values of a higher ranking over those of a lower to the extent that they will invest time, work and sacrifice to order to attain them: for example, people will routinely defer a measure of immediate gratification in order to secure a child's education, their own retirement, etc.

Hence, the relativity of value experience transitions to the beginnings of an objective morality which ensures personal fulfillment and transcendence. Since all ethics must ultimately advise our decisions in some way, Scheler’s non-formal value-based ethics promises to potentially achieve this end through our cognitive understanding and channeling of the advance information offered through our emotive life.

== Philosophy vs. psychology: a relation of synergy ==
Critics and admirers alike find Scheler's ethics susceptible to flights of romanticism as "decisively canceling the normative character of ethical acts." &lt;ref&gt;Rocco Buttiglione, Karol Wojtyla: The Thought of the Man who Became Pope John Paul II, trans. Paolo Guietti, Francesca Murphy (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1997). pp. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt; No surprise since a non-formal ethics does not rely on a system of rules or principles, but only implicit suggestions.&lt;ref&gt;Scheler maintained that two events insure the restoration of a rightly ordered  heart '''''Ordo Amoris''''': (a) the appearance of model persons ("role models"), and (b) natural mystic religious experience.&lt;/ref&gt;  More pragmatic applications of Scheler's principles might best be implemented under the controlled guidance of therapeutic psychology.

Scheler’s ideas are inspiring to anyone who shares a common philosophical belief in the fundamental value of persons and in developing each of us to our optimum potential. This is all the more true when we consider just what this might mean for a well-ordered free and democratic society.

However, extreme care should be taken not to assume Scheler’s philosophy is somehow based purely in some sort of progressive bottom-up psychology: for example, Abraham [[Maslow’s hierarchy of needs]], Jean Piaget’s [[theory of cognitive development]], or Lawrence Kohlberg’s [[Stages of Moral Development]].  This is particularly important since Scheler’s relied extensively on hierarchical “stratification” models as a sort of general motif&lt;ref&gt;Hierarchy of Model Person Types from lowest to highest: the Bon Vivant, the Hero, the Genius and the Saint. (See Formalism, p. 585). Hierarchy of Essential Forms of Human Togetherness from lowest to highest: the Herd, the Family &amp; Live-Community, the Society, and the Collective Persons of Church and Nation. Hierarchy of Spheres of Consciousness (Forms of Cognition or Knowing) from lowest to highest: the Inanimate, the Animate, I-Thou and the Absolute.&lt;/ref&gt; for his philosophy as a whole, as well as for a wide range of editorial topics.  In spite many striking content similarities with scientific psychological theories, Scheler’s philosophy is, by contrast, first and foremost a serviceable speculative top-down emanation model,&lt;ref&gt;Formalism, p 94.&lt;/ref&gt; guided by love and values, and based upon dualistic metaphysical principals &lt;ref&gt;Arthur R. Luther, “The Articulated Unity of Being in Scheler’s Phenomenology. Basic Drive and Spirit,” in Max Scheler (1874-1928) Centennial Essays, ed. Manfred S. Frings (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1974), pp 1-42.  See also Max Scheler, Man’s Place in Nature.  Also see “Frings”, Chapter 2 “On the Bio-Psychic World.”  For Scheler, Spirit is manifest infinitely as the Divine Essence, or God (depending upon your religious orientation); and finitely as persons and collectively as the nation and church.  Persons are the juncture point and locus between drives (Vital Urge) and Spirit.&lt;/ref&gt; of '''Vital Urge''' (''Drang'')&lt;ref&gt;"Frings", p 11. "...the lowest stratum of psychic being is the presence of an unspecified, undifferentiated, blind "''urge forward''" (''Drang''). It is completely conscious-less and, therefore without inner or outer sensation. This urge reveals itself as a slow "towards" and "away from" (e.g. towards light) and it must first be attributed to plant life. It is at the same time the "vapor" (''Dampf''), which is at the bottom of all life, driving forward all life up to its highest manifestations."&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Spirit''' (''Geist'').&lt;ref&gt;"Frings, pp 15-17. "...the essential difference between animal and man is the presence of ''Spirit'' (''Geist''), which makes human life highly independent of drives, and independent of  attachment to environment (in contrast to the basically environment-stricken animal).... This is clear when we consider that man forms his own environment in social life and history as well as in using artificial means to change it for better adjustment and comfort.... Spirit elevates man above world and above himself (as organic being).... Spirit, then, cannot have its foundation or source in this objective world, but only in the primordial principal of the cosmos (''Urgrund'') itself."&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, science alone can not fully account the sustaining spiritual forces that lift man and culture beyond the limitations of practical necessity, adaptation and natural selection. When scientific method can no longer design a model to verify what the scientist suspects, he becomes a philosopher of sorts...that is when the scientific community considers that member to have gone "soft in the head"—a distinction which ironically includes most of the best and brightest of science.

Gallian |year=2010 |isbn=9780547165097}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=110 |chapter= Cyclic Groups and the Order of an Element |title=Introduction To Abstract Algebra |author = W. Keith Nicholson |year = 1999 |isbn=0471331090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finite cyclic groups==
For every finite group ''G'' of order ''n'', the following statements are equivalent:
* ''G'' is cyclic.
* For every divisor ''d'' of ''n'', ''G'' has exactly one subgroup of order ''d''.
* For every divisor ''d'' of ''n'', ''G'' has at most one subgroup of order ''d''.
This statement is known by various names such as '''characterization by subgroups'''.&lt;ref name="Roman2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Roman|title=Fundamentals of Group Theory: An Advanced Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eWkqG0aiVsMC&amp;pg=PA44|year=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-8176-8300-9|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Balakrishnan1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=V. K. Balakrishnan|title=Schaum's Outline of Combinatorics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=di0WSsXV74wC&amp;pg=PA155|year=1994|publisher=McGraw-Hill Prof Med/Tech|isbn=978-0-07-003575-1|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stroppel2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Markus Stroppel|title=Locally Compact Groups|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3_BPupMDRr8C&amp;pg=PA64|year=2006|publisher=European Mathematical Society|isbn=978-3-03719-016-6|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[cyclic group]] for some characterization.)&lt;!-- if I remember correctly, an abelian group is cyclic if every Sylow subgroup is cyclic. --&gt;

There exist finite groups other than cyclic groups with the property that all proper subgroups are cyclic; the [[Klein group]] is an example. However, the Klein group has more than one subgroup of order 2, so it does not meet the conditions of the characterization.

==The infinite cyclic group==
The infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive subgroup '''Z''' of the integers. There is one subgroup ''d'''''Z''' for each integer ''d'' (consisting of the multiples of ''d''), and with the exception of the trivial group (generated by ''d''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) every such subgroup is itself an infinite cyclic group. Because the infinite cyclic group is a [[free group]] on one generator (and the trivial group is a free group on no generators), this result can be seen as a special case of the [[Nielsen–Schreier theorem]] that every subgroup of a free group is itself free.&lt;ref name="aluffi"&gt;{{citation|title=Algebra, Chapter 0|volume=104|series=Graduate Studies in Mathematics|first=Paolo|last=Aluffi|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2009|isbn=9780821847817|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=deWkZWYbyHQC&amp;pg=PA82|pages=82–84|contribution=6.4 Example: Subgroups of Cyclic Groups}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental theorem for finite cyclic groups can be established from the same theorem for the infinite cyclic groups, by viewing each finite cyclic group as a [[quotient group]] of the infinite cyclic group.&lt;ref name="aluffi"/&gt;

==Lattice of subgroups==
In both the finite and the infinite case, the [[lattice of subgroups]] of a cyclic group is isomorphic to the [[Duality (order theory)|dual]] of a [[divisibility]] lattice. In the finite case, the lattice of subgroups of a cyclic group of order ''n'' is isomorphic to the dual of the lattice of divisors of ''n'', with a subgroup of order ''n''/''d'' for each divisor ''d''. The subgroup of order ''n''/''d'' is a subgroup of the subgroup of order ''n''/''e'' if and only if ''e'' is a divisor of ''d''. The lattice of subgroups of the infinite cyclic group can be described in the same way, as the dual of the divisibility lattice of all positive integers. If the infinite cyclic group is represented as the additive group on the integers, then the subgroup generated by ''d'' is a subgroup of the subgroup generated by ''e'' if and only if ''e'' is a divisor of ''d''.&lt;ref name="aluffi"/&gt;

Divisibility lattices are [[distributive lattice]]s, and therefore so are the lattices of subgroups of cyclic groups. This provides another alternative characterization of the finite cyclic groups: they are exactly the finite groups whose lattices of subgroups are distributive. More generally, a [[finitely generated group]] is cyclic if and only if its lattice of subgroups is distributive and an arbitrary group is [[locally cyclic group|locally cyclic]] if and only its lattice of subgroups is distributive.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The '''Syrian Nonviolence Movement''' is a [[non-governmental organization]] formed in 2011 by a group of [[Syrian]] activists. They believe in peaceful struggle and [[civil resistance]] as a way to achieve social, cultural and political change in the Syrian state and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alharak.org/about-snm.html | title=About SNM | publisher=Syrian Nonviolence Movement website | accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Testosterone poisoning''' is a pejorative metaphor for [[stereotypically]] male behavior. Various authors have used the phrase to criticize [[aggression]] in men, including [[war]]. The concept of ''testosterone poisoning'' is based on the association of masculinity with harmful behaviors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bigthink.com/Mind-Matters/testosterone-poisoning-isnt-what-you-think|title=Testosterone Poisoning Isn't What You Think|date=2009-12-09|work=Big Think|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;; for example, from 1980 to 2008 males were convicted of the vast majority of [[homicide]]s in the United States, representing 90.5% of the total number of offenders.&lt;ref name="bjs.gov"&gt;[http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf "Homicide Trends in the United States, 1980-2008"] [[United States Department of Justice]] (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The term capitalizes on the perception that [[masculinity]] is controlled by the hormone [[testosterone]].

==Origins==

An early printed reference to "testosterone poisoning" came in 1975 from actor [[Alan Alda]]. In a parody of self-help writing, Alda diagnoses the "ailment" of masculinity and offers methods for its "cure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Rainbolt |editor1-first=Martha |editor2-last=Fleetwood |editor2-first=Janet |title=On the Contrary: Essays by Men and Women |date=1984 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-87-395720-5 |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6vrqg7dEyvUC&amp;pg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He writes:

{{quote|Everyone knows that testosterone, the so-called male hormone, is found in both men and women. What is not so well known, is that men have an overdose... Until recently it has been thought that the level of testosterone in men is normal simply because they have it. But if you consider how abnormal their ''behavior'' is, then you are led to the hypothesis that almost all men are suffering from ''testosterone poisoning''.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Alda, "What Every Woman Should Know About Men", Ms., New York, October 1975&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ten years later, that same sentence from Alda's article was quoted in the 1985 book ''A Feminist Dictionary''.&lt;ref&gt;''A Feminist Dictionary'', ed. Kramarae and Treichler, Pandora Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Sagan]] gave the phrase more publicity when he praised [[Moondance magazine]] writer [[Daniela Gioseffi]]'s [[American Book Award]] winner ''Women on War'':

{{quote|A book of searing analysis and cries from the heart on the madness of war. Why is the half of humanity with a special sensitivity to the preciousness of life, the half untainted by testosterone poisoning, almost wholly unrepresented in defense establishments and peace negotiations worldwide?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italianamericanwriters.com/womenonwar.html Women On War], Daniela Gioseffi.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some took offense at this phrase. A ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' [[op-ed]] piece referred to Professor Sagan's use directly:

{{quote|[[Carl Sagan]] even pompously informs us that the whole planet is imminently endangered by "testosterone poisoning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Patrick M. Arnold|title=In Academe, Misogyny Meets Its Match: Misandrosy : Behavior: The uproar at Mills College illustrates a nasty new trend: man-hating. What parent would send a son into such an environment?|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-14/local/me-2_1_mills-college|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=7 March 2015|date=14 May 1990|quote=It is the shadow side of the extreme feminist movement, an ideology of hate whose name is not yet found in the dictionary.

[...] [[Carl Sagan]] even pompously informs us that the whole planet is imminently endangered by "testosterone poisoning."}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bruce Tremper used the term in ''The Avalanche Review'', stating that being "a man" is best proven by dying "a stupendously violent death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avalanche.org/~moonstone/TAR/Human%20Being.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051108105305/http://www.avalanche.org/~moonstone/TAR/Human%20Being.htm |archivedate=2005-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elaine Weiss writes in ''Family and Friends' Guide to Domestic Violence'' that "deadly testosterone poisoning" (DTP) is one of "many misunderstandings about abusive men". She continues: "this is not a war of the hormones, an inevitable biological clash between estrogen and testosterone. If it were, then there would be more of it; every heterosexual relationship would be abusive".&lt;ref name="Weiss"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weiss |first1=Elaine |title=Family &amp; Friends' Guide to Domestic Violence: How to Listen, Talk, and Take Action when Someone You Care about is Being Abused |date=2003 |publisher=Volcano Press |isbn=978-1-88-424422-3 |page=47 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FQlgRiO4anwC&amp;pg=PA47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1996 ''[[Psychology Today]]'' article refers to the phrase as "only a joke," but notes, in reference to several studies about testosterone and male [[employment]], that testosterone levels were lower for successful new male employees at a southern U.S. oil firm.&lt;ref name="Doskoch"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Doskoch |first1=Peter |title=The Trouble with Testosterone |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199612/the-trouble-testosterone |work=Psychology Today |date=December 1996 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130131202132/http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19961201-000021.html |archivedate=31 January 2013 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mazur ''et al.'' (1998) stated that males with higher testosterone levels tend to be slightly more aggressive, and argue that this appears to be due to the way acting aggressively raises testosterone levels rather than the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;Mazur, A. &amp; Booth, A. (1998) Testosterone and dominance in men. ''Behavioral &amp; Brain Sciences'' 21:353--397.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Berenbaum ''et al.'' (1997) stated that exposure to high levels of [[androgens]] [[Gestation|''in utero'']] are associated with higher levels of adult aggression (Reinisch, 1981;&lt;ref&gt;Reinisch, J.M (1981) Prenatal exposure to synthetic progestins increases potential for aggression in humans. ''Science'' 211:1171--1173.&lt;/ref&gt; Berenbaum &amp; Reinisch, 1997&lt;ref&gt;Berenbaum, S.A. &amp; Reinisch, J.M. (1997) Early androgen effects on aggression in children and adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia ''Psychoneuroendocrinology'' 22:505--515.&lt;/ref&gt;).

McDermott (2007) found a significant positive relationship between levels of testosterone and aggression.&lt;ref&gt;McDermott, R. (2007) "Testosterone and Aggression in a Simulated Crisis Game" The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol. 614, No. 1, 15-33.(2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

References to ''testosterone poisoning'' are often used to criticize men.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}  Magazine editor [[Tina Brown]] uses the phrase thematically in a 2005 ''[[Washington Post]]'' essay about the downfall of [[Harvard University]] president [[Larry Summers]] and the problems of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s former embattled CEO [[Michael Eisner]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A48436-2005Feb23.html "Why Can't a Man Be More Like a Woman?"] by Tina Brown, ''The Washington Post,'' Feb. 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beth Gallagher's ''[[Salon.com]]'' essay "Road Sows" about the drawbacks of [[sports utility vehicle]]s describes those vehicles' growing popularity as having spread beyond testosterone poisoned men to [[soccer moms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2000/05/24/road_sow/email.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113040943/http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2000/05/24/road_sow/email.html |archivedate=2007-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. [[Karl Albrecht]] makes testosterone poisoning a synonym for [[male chauvinism]] in his 2002 book ''The Power of Minds at Work: Organizational Intelligence in Action'' where he describes it as one of 17 basic syndromes of [[:wikt:dysfunction|dysfunction]].&lt;ref&gt;http://karlalbrecht.com/articles/17syndromes.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally this perceived moral decadence of men turns against women, as in [[Kay S. Hymowitz]]'s sarcastic reference to Western [[Feminism|feminists]] in a 2003 ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' essay chiding them for neglecting the rights of [[Third World]] women in [[Muslim]] countries:

{{quote|There is no need, in their minds, to distinguish between [[Osama bin Laden|Osama]], [[Saddam Hussein|Saddam]], and [[George W. Bush|Bush]]: They're all suffering from testosterone poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/_wsj-the_women_feminists.htm "The Women Feminists Forgot"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011104108/http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/_wsj-the_women_feminists.htm |date=2013-10-11 }}, by Kay S. Hymowitz, ''The Wall Street Journal,'' Mar. 7, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several readers submitted "testosterone poisoning" to a 2001 ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' competition to find a male equivalent for [[hysteria]] (which was originally regarded as a female-only condition).&lt;ref&gt;The Atlantic, [https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2001/06/fugitives.htm Word Fugitives], Barbara Wallraff, June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[National Public Radio|National Public Radio's]]'' popular show "[[Car Talk]]" has used the term repeatedly.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20040607073548/http://www.cartalk.com/content/features/Summer-Driving-Tips/other.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Neuroscientist Christoph Eisenegger at the [[University of Zurich]] has conducted a study and concludes that the evidence debunks the myth that testosterone causes aggressive, egocentric behaviour, suggesting instead that the sex hormone can encourage fair play, particularly if it improves a person's status.&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life/spirituality/self-help/Testosterone-leads-to-fairness-not-aggression/articleshow/5318244.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study published in ''Nature'', "a single dose of testosterone in women causes a substantial increase in fair bargaining behaviour, thereby reducing bargaining conflicts and increasing the efficiency of social interactions. However, subjects who believed that they received testosterone—regardless of whether they actually received it or not—behaved much more unfairly than those who believed that they were treated with placebo."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7279/full/nature08711.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}
'''Transference''' ({{lang-de|Übertragung}}) is a theoretical phenomenon characterized by unconscious redirection of the feelings a person has about a second person to feelings the first person has about a third person. It usually concerns feelings from an important second-person relationship from childhood, and is sometimes considered inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Kapelovitz | first = Leonard H. | title = To Love and To Work/A Demonstration and Discussion of Psychotherapy | year = 1987 | page = 66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary (8th ed. 1976).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language (2nd College Ed. 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; Transference was first described by [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], who considered it an important part of psychoanalytic treatment.

== Occurrence ==
It is common for people to transfer feelings from their parents to their partners or children (that is, cross-generational entanglements). For instance, one could mistrust somebody who resembles an ex-spouse in manners, voice, or external appearance, or be overly compliant to someone who resembles a childhood friend.

In ''The Psychology of the Transference'', [[Carl Jung]] states that within the transference [[dyad (sociology)|dyad]] both participants typically experience a variety of opposites, that in love and in psychological growth, the key to success is the ability to endure the tension of the opposites without abandoning the process, and that this tension allows one to grow and to transform.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Jung|Jung, Carl C.]] ''The Psychology of the Transference'', Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-01752-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only in a personally or socially harmful context can transference be described as a pathological issue. A modern, social-cognitive perspective on transference explains how it can occur in everyday life. When people meet a new person who reminds them of someone else, they unconsciously infer that the new person has traits similar to the person previously known.&lt;ref name="soccogtrans"&gt;Andersen, S. M. &amp; Berk., M. (1998). The social-cognitive model of transference: Experiencing past relationships in the present. ''Current Directions in Psychological Science, 7(4)'', 109-115.&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective has generated a wealth of research that illuminated how people tend to repeat relationship patterns from the past in the present.

High-profile serial killers often transfer unresolved rage toward previous love or hate-objects onto "surrogates", or individuals resembling or otherwise calling to mind the original object of that hate. It is believed in the instance of [[Ted Bundy]], he repeatedly killed brunette women who reminded him of a previous girlfriend with whom he had become infatuated, but who had ended the relationship, leaving Bundy rejected and pathologically rageful (Bundy, however, denied this as a motivating factor in his crimes).&lt;ref&gt;"Michaels, S. G., &amp; Aynesworth, H. (2000). ''Ted Bundy: Conversations with a killer'', Dallas: Authorlink.&lt;/ref&gt; This notwithstanding, Bundy's behavior could be considered pathological insofar as he may have had [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] or [[antisocial personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Describing Ted Bundy’s Personality and Working towards DSM-V. Douglas B. Samuel and Thomas A. Widiger. Department of Psychology at the University of Kentucky.Independent Practitioner (2007), 27 (1), pp. 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; If so, normal transference mechanisms cannot be held causative of his homicidal behavior.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

[[Sigmund Freud]] held that transference plays a large role in male homosexuality. In ''The Ego and the Id'', he claimed that eroticism between males can be an outcome of a "[psychically] non-economic" hostility, which is unconsciously subverted into love and sexual attraction.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1960). ''The ego and the id''. J. Strachey (Ed.). (J. Riviere, Trans.). New York: W.W. Norton. (Original work published 1923)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transference and countertransference during psychotherapy ==
In a therapy context, transference refers to redirection of a patient's feelings for a significant person to the therapist. Transference is often manifested as an erotic attraction towards a therapist, but can be seen in many other forms such as rage, hatred, mistrust, [[parentification]], extreme dependence, or even placing the therapist in a god-like or guru status.  When Freud initially encountered transference in his therapy with patients, he thought he was encountering patient resistance, as he recognized the phenomenon when a patient refused to participate in a session of [[Free association (psychology)|free association]]. But what he learned was that the analysis of the transference was actually the work that needed to be done: "the transference, which, whether affectionate or hostile, seemed in every case to constitute the greatest threat to the treatment, becomes its best tool".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; The focus in [[psychodynamic psychotherapy]] is, in large part, the therapist and patient recognizing the transference relationship and exploring the relationship's meaning.  Since the transference between patient and therapist happens on an unconscious level, psychodynamic therapists who are largely concerned with a patient's unconscious material use the transference to reveal unresolved conflicts patients have with childhood figures.

[[Countertransference]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Horacio Etchegoyen]]: ''The Fundamentals of Psychoanalytic Technique'', Karnac Books ed., New Ed, 2005, {{ISBN|1-85575-455-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
is defined as redirection of a therapist's feelings toward a patient, or more generally, as a therapist's emotional entanglement with a patient.  A therapist's attunement to their own countertransference is nearly as critical as understanding the transference.  Not only does this help therapists regulate their emotions in the [[therapeutic relationship]], but it also gives therapists valuable insight into what patients are attempting to elicit in them.  For example, a therapist who is sexually attracted to a patient must understand the countertransference aspect (if any) of the attraction, and look at how the patient might be eliciting this attraction. Once any countertransference aspect has been identified, the therapist can ask the patient what his or her feelings are toward the therapist, and can explore how those feelings relate to unconscious motivations, desires, or fears.

Another contrasting perspective on transference and countertransference is offered in [[classical Adlerian psychotherapy]].  Rather than using the patient's transference strategically in therapy, the positive or [[negative transference]] is diplomatically pointed out and explained as an obstacle to cooperation and improvement.  For the therapist, any signs of countertransference would suggest that his or her own personal [[training analysis (psychotherapy)|training analysis]] needs to be continued to overcome these tendencies.  Andrea Celenza noted in 2010 that "the use of the analyst's countertransference remains a point of controversy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Celenza|first=Andrea|date=October 2010|title=The guilty pleasure of erotic countertransference: searching for radial true|journal=Studies in Gender and Sexuality|volume=11|issue=4|pages=175–183|doi=10.1080/15240657.2010.513222|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transient modelling''' is a way of looking at a process with the primary criterion of time, observing the pattern of changes in the subject being studied over time. The obverse of it is [[Steady state]], where you might know only the starting and ending figures but do not understand the process by which they were derived.

Transient models will reveal the pattern of a process, which might be [[sinusoidal]] or another shape that will help to design a better system to manage that process. Transient models can be done on a [[spreadsheet]] with an ability to generate charts, or by any software that can handle data of inputs and outputs and generate some sort of a display. Transient modelling does not need a computer.  It is a methodology that has worked for centuries, by observers noting patterns of change against time, analysing the result and proposing improved design solutions.

A simple example is a garden [[water tank]]. This is being topped up by rainfall from the roof, but when the tank is full, the remaining water goes to the drain. When the gardener draws water off, the level falls. If the garden is large and the summer is hot, a steady state will occur in summer where the tank is nearly always empty in summer. If the season is wet, the garden is getting water from the sky, and the tank is not being emptied sufficiently, so in steady state it will be observed to be always full. If the gardener has a way of observing the level of water in the tank, and a record of daily rainfall and temperatures, and is precisely metering the amount of water being drawn off every day, the numbers and the dates can be recorded in spreadsheet at daily intervals. After enough samples are taken, a chart can be developed to model the rise and fall pattern over a year, or over 2 years. With a better understanding of the process, it might emerge that a 200litre water tank would run out 20–25 days a year, but a 400-litre water tank would never run out, and a 300-litre tank would run out only 1-2 day a year and therefore that would be an acceptable risk and it would be the most economical solution.

One of the best examples of transient modelling is [[transient climate simulation]]. The analysis of [[ice core]]s in glaciers to understand [[climate change]]. Ice cores have thousands of layers, each of which represents a winter season of snowfall, and trapped in these are bubbles of air, particle of space dust and pollen which reveal climatic data of the time. By mapping these to a time scale, scientists can analyse the fluctuations over time and make predictions for the future.

Transient modelling is the basis of [[weather forecasting]], of managing [[ecosystem]]s, rail timetabling, managing the electricity grid, setting the national budget, [[floating currency]], understanding traffic flows on a [[freeway]], solar gains on glass fronted buildings, or even of checking the day-to-day transactions of one's monthly [[bank statement]].

With the transient modelling approach, you understand the whole process better when the inputs and outputs are graphed against time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23867">'''Virtue epistemology''' is a contemporary [[philosophy|philosophical]] approach to [[epistemology]] that stresses the importance of intellectual, and specifically [[epistemic virtues]]. A distinguishing factor of virtue theories is that they use for the evaluation of knowledge the properties of the persons who hold beliefs in addition to or instead of the properties of propositions and beliefs. Some{{Vague|date=September 2018}} advocates of virtue epistemology claim to more closely follow theories of [[virtue ethics]], while others see only a looser analogy between virtue in ethics and virtue in epistemology.

Intellectual virtue has been a subject of philosophy since the work of [[Aristotle]], but virtue epistemology is a development in the contemporary [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition. It is characterized by efforts to solve problems of special concern to modern epistemology, such as [[theory of justification|justification]] and [[reliabilism]], by directing attention on the knower as agent in a manner similar to the way virtue ethics focuses on moral agents rather than moral acts.

== The Raft and the Pyramid ==
The development of virtue epistemology was partly inspired by a recent renewal of interest in virtue concepts among moral philosophers, and partly as a response to the intractability of competing analyses of knowledge in response to [[Edmund Gettier]]. [[Ernest Sosa]] introduced the notion of an intellectual virtue into contemporary epistemological discussion in a 1980 paper called "The Raft and the Pyramid".&lt;ref name="RandP"&gt;Sosa, Ernest. "The Raft and the Pyramid: Coherence versus Foundations in the Theory of Knowledge." ''Midwest Studies in Philosophy'' 5, (1980): 3–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Sosa argued that an appeal to intellectual virtue could resolve the conflict between foundationalists and coherentists over the structure of epistemic justification. Sosa sought to bridge the gap and create a unity between these two different epistemological theories.

[[Foundationalism]] holds that beliefs are founded or based on other beliefs in a hierarchy, similar to the bricks in the structure of a pyramid. [[Coherentism]], on the other hand, uses the metaphor of a raft in which all beliefs are not tied down by foundations but instead are interconnected due to the logical relationships between each belief. Sosa found a flaw in each of these schools of epistemology, in both cases having to do with the relationship between belief and perception.

Coherentism only allows for justification based on [[logic]]al relations between all the beliefs within a system of beliefs.  However, because perceptual beliefs may not have many logical ties with other beliefs in the system, the coherentist account of knowledge can be said to be inadequate to accommodate the importance normally attributed to perceptual information. On the other hand, Sosa also found problems in the foundationalist approach to epistemology. Foundationalism arguably encounters a problem when attempting to describe how foundational beliefs relate to the sensory experiences that support them.

Coherentism and foundationalism developed as a response to the problems with the "traditional" account of knowledge (as justified true belief) developed by [[Edmund Gettier]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="Gettier"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Edmund|last=Gettier|title=Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?|journal=Analysis|volume=23|year=1963|pages=121–23|doi=10.1093/analys/23.6.121}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of Gettier's counterexamples, competing theories had been developed by a variety of philosophers, but the dispute between coherentists and foundationalists proved to be intractable. Sosa's paper suggested that virtue may help avoid the disputes between coherentist and foundationalist accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Virtue Epistemology: Essays on Epistemic Virtue and Responsibility|editor1=Linda Zagzebski|editor2=Abrol Fairweather|year=2001|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Virtue epistemology replaces formulaic expressions for apprehending knowledge, such as "S knows that p", by amending these formulas with virtue theory applied to intellect, where virtue then becomes the fulcrum for assessing potential candidates of "knowledge". This substitution raises problems of its own, however. If the same uncertainty about accuracy in creating a formula for testing knowledge equally applies to the authenticity of virtue, then one cannot know if the target virtue is credible. Some virtue epistemologists use reliabilism as a basis for belief justification, stressing reliable functioning of the intellect.&lt;ref name="RandP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AgentReliabilism"&gt;Greco, J. "Agent Reliabilism." J. Tomberlin (ed.) ''Philosophical Perspectives'' 13,(1999): 273–96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skeptics" &gt;Greco, J. ''Putting Skeptics in their Place'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas put forth in the area of virtue epistemology are consistent with some of the ideas present in [[contextualism]]. Several areas of contextual epistemology attack the problem of knowledge from a very objective standpoint. Virtue epistemology attempts to simplify the analysis of knowledge by replacing certain abstractions involved in the pursuit of the highest level of knowledge with flexible and contextual instances. Specifically, it leaves room for [[cognitive relativism]]. This degree of reliability is not constant; it can change depending on the context. Under this view, a well-functioning intellectual faculty is a necessary condition for the formation of knowledge. This is quite different from other areas of epistemology because it takes the state of an individual's intellect into account. As a result of this, social context also has the ability to alter knowledge. Social contexts change over time, making it necessary for the beliefs and knowledge to change with it.

In addition, virtue epistemology, similar to virtue ethics, is based on the intellectual qualities in relation to the individual as opposed to the quality of the belief; virtue epistemology is person-based, rather than belief-based. Consequently, virtue epistemology can also stress "epistemic responsibility", that is, an individual is held responsible for the virtue of their knowledge-gathering faculties.

For example, [[Massimo Pigliucci]] applies virtue epistemology to critical thinking and suggests the virtuous individual will consider the following:

*Non-dismissive consideration of arguments
*Charitable interpretation of opposing arguments
*Awareness of one's own presuppositions and potential for being mistaken
*Consultation of expert knowledge
*Reliability of source material
*Knowledge of what one is talking about rather than merely repeating others' opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pigliucci |first1=Massimo |authorlink1=Massimo Pigliucci |title=The Virtuous Skeptic |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=54-57 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109200525/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_virtuous_skeptic |accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Varieties ==
Virtue epistemologists differ in the role they believe virtue to play: eliminative virtue epistemology uses the concepts of intellectual virtue and intellectual vice to do away with epistemic concepts like knowledge and justification, while non-eliminative virtue epistemology gives a role for such traditional concepts and uses virtue to provide substantive explanation of those concepts.

Virtue epistemologists differ in what they believe epistemic virtues to be. Some accounts are Aristotelian, drawing a relationship between intellectual virtue and character in a similar way to the way moral virtue is related to character, while "weak" virtue epistemology have an account that doesn't require any particular commitment or cultivation of intellectual virtue. [[Abrol Fairweather]] argues that these "weak" virtue epistemologists "merely [use] virtue theory as a novel lexicon for expressing an independent epistemic theory".&lt;ref name="Fairweather"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Abrol|last=Fairweather|chapter=Epistemic Motivation|title=Virtue Epistemology: Essays on Virtue and Responsibility|year=2001|editor1=Abrol Fairweather|editor2=Linda Zagzebski|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of describing the differences in virtue epistemology is to say that there are two concurrent modes of thought in contemporary virtue epistemology, with one side favoring the "virtue reliabilist" account of virtues as reliably functioning cognitive faculties, and one favoring a "virtue responsibilist" account in which the responsible epistemic conduct of the agent plays a key role.

=== Virtue reliabilism ===
The virtue reliabilist takes the approach that the process whereby [[truth]] is garnered must be reliable. However, the stress of the reliability is not placed upon the mechanism of justification. Instead, the degree of reality-tracking ability determines how virtuous the individual's intellect is, and therefore how good one's knowledge is.

For Sosa, the more virtuous faculties are related to direct sensory perception and memory, and less virtuous capacities are ones related to beliefs derived from the primary memory or [[empirical evidence|sense experience]]. Sosa has two criteria for having a belief to be warranted, or in his words, "fully apt". A belief must satisfy the first condition of being "meta-justified" in which the agent must have hit the truth as such. Furthermore, a belief must have been 'apt' in which the agent must have been displaying his virtuous capacities in claiming such a belief or hitting the truth as such. To argue by analogy, a hunter must not only be able to hit his target, say a moose, with precision and accuracy, but the shot must have been one that the hunter ''should have taken.''

For another figure in reliabilist virtue epistemology, [[John Greco (philosopher)|John Greco]], knowledge and justified belief "are grounded in stable and reliable cognitive character. Such character may include both a person's natural cognitive faculties as well as her acquired habits of thought.... So long as such habits are both stable and successful, they make up the kind of character that gives rise to knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greco|first=John|date=1999-01-01|title=Agent Reliabilism|jstor=2676106|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=273–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; This characterization of virtue reliabilism can be construed as more inclusive than Sosa's, eschewing the focus on memorial or sensory experience and instead locating virtue in an agent's stable and reliable dispositions to generate successful cognition. In doing so, Greco can be seen as making room for the inclusion of the intellectual virtues as typically construed by the responsibilist camp of virtue epistemology, since many of these virtues can be thought of as stable, reliable dispositions of character.

=== Virtue responsibilism ===
In virtue responsibilism, the emphasis is not on faculties such as perception and memory. Instead, certain intellectual character traits are valued as more virtuous than others. These can be creativity, inquisitiveness, rational rigor, honesty, or a number of other possibilities. Generally, these theories are normative in nature. A few different approaches are taken.

Some, such as [[Lorraine Code]], think that intellectual virtues involve having the correct cognitive character and epistemic relation to the world rooted in a social context. She sees the acquisition of correct knowledge about the world as the primary "good", and the end towards which our intellectual efforts should be oriented, with the desire for truth as the primary motivating factor for our epistemological virtues.&lt;ref name="code"&gt;Code, Lorraine. ''Epistemic Responsibility'', Hanover, NH: University Press of New England for Brown University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Montmarquet]]'s theory of intellectual virtue is similar to Code's, but specifically defines additional intellectual virtues in order to defuse the potential dogmatism or fanaticism that is compatible with Code's desire for truth. The primary virtue is conscientiousness, which focuses on the correct end of intellectual living. In order to obtain conscientiousness, it is important to maintain impartiality, sobriety, and courage.&lt;ref name="james"&gt;Montmarquet, J.A. ''Epistemic Virtue and Doxastic Responsibility'', Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski]] has proposed a neo-Aristotelian model of virtue epistemology, emphasizing the role of ''phronesis'' (practical wisdom) as an architectonic virtue unifying moral and intellectual virtues even more radically than Aristotle proposed.&lt;ref name="linda"&gt;Zagzebski, Linda. "Intellectual Motivation and the Good of Truth.", in ''Intellectual Virtue: Perspectives from Ethics and Epistemology''. eds. M. DePaul and L. Zagzebski, 135–54, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; As delineated in her model, the virtues are "a deep and enduring acquired excellence of a person, involving a characteristic motivation to produce a certain desired end and reliable success in bringing about that end."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Virtues of the Mind, Selections in Epistemology: An Anthology|last=Zagzebski|first=Linda|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4051-6967-7|location=|pages=443|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As she sees it, the "characteristic motivation" of an intellectual virtue is the desire for truth, understanding, and other species of cognitive contact with reality. The notion of "reliable success" is invoked in order to avoid issues of well-intentioned but unsuccessful agents who desire truth but use poorly suited methods to pursue it.

=== Plantinga's theory of warrant ===
[[Alvin Plantinga]] offers another theory of knowledge closely related to virtue epistemology. According to him, knowledge is warranted if one's intellectual faculties are operating as they are designed to. That is, knowledge is valid if it is obtained through the correct operation of the faculties of the intellect which are designed to have  an inherent ability, because they are designed that way, to capture and produce true beliefs.&lt;ref name="plantinga"&gt;Plantinga, Alvin. ''Warrant and Proper Function'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jonathan Kvanvig's understanding and assertion ===
In Jonathan Kvanvig's essay, ''Why Inquiring Minds Want to Know?: Meno Problems and Epistemological Axiology'' he asserts that epistemology has no place in philosophical study. The value of knowledge originates from the Socratic dialogue written by Plato called [[Meno]]. In Meno, Socrates' distinction between "true belief" and "knowledge" forms the basis of the philosophical definition of knowledge as "[[justified true belief]]". Socrates explains the similarities and differences between "true belief" and "knowledge", arguing that justified true belief fails to "stay in their place" and must be "tethered". According to Kvanvig, true belief is what is necessary to maximize truth and to avoid error, thus dropping [[Theory of justification|justification]] from the equation of knowledge. He argues that once we recognize what the manipulated boundary notion of non-Gettierized account of knowledge is, then it becomes clear that there is nothing valuable about the anti-Gettier condition on knowledge. Kvanvig acknowledges that true belief falls short of knowledge, however to him, true belief is no less valuable than knowledge. Kvanvig believes that epistemology should be focused on [[understanding]], an epistemic standing that Kvanvig maintains is of more value than knowledge and justified true belief.

== Potential advantages ==
Some varieties of virtue epistemology that contain normative elements, such as virtue responsibilism, can provide a unified framework of normativity and value. Others, such as Sosa's account, can circumvent [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] skepticism with the necessity of externalism interacting with internalism. In this same vein, and because of the inherent flexibility and social nature of some of types of virtue epistemology, social conditioning and influence can be understood within an epistemological framework and explored.  This flexibility and connection between internal and external makes virtue epistemology more accessible.&lt;ref name="routledge"&gt;Zagzebski, Linda (1998, 2005). Virtue epistemology. In E.

As discussed by a parallel criticism leveled at virtue ethics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doris|first=John M.|date=1998-12-01|title=Persons, Situations, and Virtue Ethics|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0029-4624.00136/abstract|journal=Noûs|language=en|volume=32|issue=4|pages=504–530|doi=10.1111/0029-4624.00136|issn=1468-0068}}&lt;/ref&gt; virtue theories, whether moral or epistemic, typically consider character traits as stable across time, and efficacious as explanatory reasons for persons behaving and thinking as they do. However, this supposition has been challenged by the "situationist critique" in psychology, which argues that human epistemic character changes depending on context, even when that change is epistemically irrelevant. Thus, irrelevant differences in a situation can prompt a drastic change in cognitive behavior.

Reliabilists might characterize this as effecting a drop in reliable functioning, whereas responsibilists would see these variations as negating one's excellent cognitive character. It is therefore argued that virtue theorists should either amend their conception of human psychology to accommodate this or explain how the results of situationist psychological research do not contradict their theory.

{{Unreferenced|date=June 2018}}
'''Women's work''' or '''woman's work''' is [[Manual labour|work]] believed to be exclusively the domain of women and associates particular tasks with the [[female]] gender. It is particularly used with regard to work that a mother or wife will perform within a family and household. (See [[Division_of_labour#Gendered_division_of_labour|gendered division of labour]].)
Related concepts include [[gender role]], [[wage labour]] and [[employment]], female [[workforce]], and [[women's rights]] (cf. [[Gender role#Gender roles and feminism|Gender roles and feminism]]). The term may be [[pejorative]], when applied to [[men]] performing roles which are largely designated for women. 

The term "women's work" may indicate a role with children as defined by [[nature]] in that only women are biologically capable of performing them: [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], and [[breastfeeding]]. It may also refer to professions that involve these functions: [[midwife]] and [[wet nurse]]. "Women's work" may also refer to roles in [[raising children]] particularly within the home: [[diaper]] changing and related [[hygiene]], [[toilet training]], [[bathing]], clothing, feeding, monitoring, and education with regard to [[personal care]]. It may also refer to professions that include these functions such as that of: [[teacher]] (up to the age of puberty), [[governess]], [[nanny]], [[day care]] worker, and [[au pair]]. "Women's work" may also refer to roles related to [[housekeeping]] such as: [[cooking]], [[sewing]], [[ironing]], and '''cleaning'''.  It may also refer to professions that include these functions such as: [[maid]] and [[cook (domestic worker)|cook]]. Though much of "women's work" is indoors, some is outdoors such as: fetching water, [[grocery]] shopping or food [[foraging]], and [[gardening]]. 

By contrast, "men's work" involves the usage of [[Physical strength|strength]] or work outdoors, also considered macro power which is defined as public sphere power; mechanical, electrical or electronic knowledge and skill; employment ("bread-winning", "bringing home the bacon"); most dealings with money; or higher reasoning to perform tasks. The term micro power refers to men having greater power in the home; which means that it is easier for men to avoid house work and care labor. Micro power may also be a tool men use to prevent women from entering the workforce. When women are kept in the private sphere, men remain the sole provider financially, which provides headway in American society. Among some people, men's work is considered to be the opposite of "women's work" and thus does not include activities within the home or with children, though "men's work" traditionally includes work that involves both (such as repairing appliances and disciplining children).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15922">In [[political communication]], the phrase "'''you're either with us, or against us'''" and similar variations are used to depict situations as being [[Polarization (politics)|polarized]] and to force [[witness]]es, [[wikt:bystander|bystander]]s, or others unaligned with some form of pre-existing conflict to either become [[allies]] of the speaking party or lose favor. The implied consequence of not joining the team effort is to be deemed an enemy. An example is the statement of the former [[US President]] [[George W. Bush]], who said after [[9/11]] at the launch of his [[War on Terror|anti-terrorism campaign]] in the form "Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-a-2001-09-21-14-bush-66411197/549664.html Bush: 'You Are Either With Us, Or With the Terrorists' - 2001-09-21], ''[[Voice of America]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The statement generally is a descriptive statement identifying the beliefs of the speaker(s), and thus state a basic assumption, not a logical conclusion. It may also be interpreted as a [[speech act]]. Sometimes but not always interpreted as a [[splitting (psychology)|splitting]] or a  [[false dilemma]], which is an [[informal fallacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/black-or-white|title=Your logical fallacy is black or white|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some see the statement as a way of persuading others to choose sides in a conflict which does not allow the position of [[Neutral country|neutrality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Only when there are no alternatives like a [[middle ground]] does the phrase hold validity as a logical conclusion. The phrases are a form of argumentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Historical quotations ===
&lt;!--Chronological order please--&gt;
* From the [[Book of Joshua]] [[S:Bible (World English)/Joshua#Chapter 5|(Chap. 5:13)]]: "It happened, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Joshua went to him, and said to him, 'Are you for us, or for our adversaries?{{'"}}
* The [[Synoptic Gospels]] attribute the following quote to [[Jesus]]: "Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters" (Matthew 12:30), as well as its [[contrapositive]], "Whoever is not against us is for us" (Luke 9:50; Mark 9:40).&lt;ref&gt;New Revised Standard Version&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]], in an oration before [[Julius Caesar]] in 46 BCE, published as [[Pro Ligario]], made the following distinction: "For we heard you say that we looked upon all as enemies that were not with us; but that you looked upon all as friends that were not against you."&lt;ref&gt;Pro Ligario 11 (33), translation from {{cite book|first1= Marcus Tullius|last1=Cicero|first2=William|last2=Duncan|title=Cicero's Select Orations, Translated Into English|publisher=Sidney's Press|year=1811}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vladimir Ilyich Lenin]], in a speech discussing the Chief Committee for Political Education, told the assembled delegates that "It is with absolute frankness that we speak of this struggle of the proletariat; each man must choose between joining our side or the other side. Any attempt to avoid taking sides in this issue must end in fiasco."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/nov/03.htm] Speech Delivered At An All-Russia Conference Of Political Education Workers Of Gubernia and Uyezd Education Departments November 3, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[George Orwell]] wrote in his 1942 essay "Pacifism and the War", "If you hamper the war effort of one side you automatically help that of the other. Nor is there any real way of remaining outside such a war as the present one. In practice, 'he that is not with me is against me'. The idea that you can somehow remain aloof from and superior to the struggle, while living on food which British sailors have to risk their lives to bring you, is a bourgeois illusion bred of money and security."
* [[Benito Mussolini]] declared in speeches across fascist Italy:  "O con noi o contro di noi"—You're either with us or against us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilduce.net/motti.htm|title=Il Duce: Benito Mussolini e La Storia del Fascismo - Frasi e Motti|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[János Kádár]], in an effort to unite Hungary after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], announced in December 1961, "those who are not against us are with us."
* Common form of [[Cold War]] terminology. On 30 September 1970, the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel#Milwaukee Journal|Milwaukee Journal]]'' quoted a police [[official]] of the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74]] as saying to his [[political prisoner]]s: "You make yourself ridiculous{{sic}} by thinking you can do anything. The word is divided in two. The [[Russia]]ns and the [[United States|America]]ns, no one else. What are we? Americans.

=== In literature and popular culture ===
* In the movie ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', Gaston tells fellow citizens of his village that "If you're not with us, you're against us," and thereafter locks up Belle and her father so he can hunt the Beast.
* In the ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' movie ''[[Magnum Force]]'', one of the suspects tells [[Harry Callahan (character)|Harry Callahan]], "Either you're for us or you're against us."
* In the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of the [[film]] ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'', Anakin Skywalker (aka [[Darth Vader]]) says to [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], "If you're not with me, then you're my enemy." Obi-Wan responds, "Only a [[Sith]] deals in absolutes." His response is an absolute statement, although linguists are divided as to whether the "deals" part of the phrase makes this not a contradictory statement.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}
* Towards the end of [[Joseph Heller]]'s ''[[Catch-22]]'', Colonels Korn and Cathcart equate fighting for their country with fighting for the benefit of the two of them. Korn tells the protagonist Yossarian: "You're either for us or against your country. It's as simple as that." A reviewer of ''Catch-22'' found this "flawless" logical indulgence by the commanding colonels to be comparable to Heller's parody of [[Charles Erwin Wilson]]'s statement, often paraphrased as, "[[Charles Erwin Wilson#Secretary of Defense|What's good for General Motors is good for the country]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=War Stars: The Superweapon and the American Imagination|author=H.

* In a 1912 edition of ''[[John Bull's Other Island]]'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]], an advertisement for ''[[The Clarion]]'', a socialist newspaper, used the phrase to attract those interested in the debate on [[socialism]].
* In the movie ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', the protagonist meets with his childhood friend Messala. He has barely said hello to Ben-Hur when he is dunning him for the names of those Jews who are speaking out against the Roman occupation. Ben-Hur refuses to act as informer, and Messala utters, "You're either with me or against me".
*In Act III of Arthur Miller's ''[[The Crucible]]'', Deputy Governor John Danforth states, "But you must understand, sir, that a person is either with this court or he must be counted against it, there is no road between."
* A professional wrestling faction in [[WWE]], called [[The Nexus (professional wrestling)|The Nexus]], used the slogan "You're either Nexus, or you're against us".
* [[Stephen Colbert]] has parodied the sentence on several occasions, for instance with "Either you are for the war [in Iraq] or you hate America" and "George W. Bush: great president or the greatest president?", after which he usually adds "It's that simple!"&lt;ref name="Sinnott-ArmstrongFogelin2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Walter Sinnott-Armstrong|author2=Robert J.

* In the ''[[Smallville]]'' episode "Shattered", [[Lex Luthor]] tells [[Clark Kent]], "You're either with me or against me, Clark. Choose right now."
* In the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' 2003 TV series]] episode "The Shredder Strikes, Part One" [[The Shredder]] tells the Turtles "Those who are not with me are against me, and I crush anyone who stands against me!" right before facing them for the first time.
* In the film ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'', [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Dr. Klaus Schmidt / Sebastian Shaw]] tells the [[X-Men]], "If you are not with us, then by definition, you are against us."
* ''[[Futurama]]'' makes a parody of this concept, when the character Zapp Brannigan expresses disdain about the members of the Neutral Planet who didn't take side in a conflict by commenting concerns like "With enemies you know where they stand but with neutrals? Who knows? It sickens me" or "What makes a man turn neutral? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality?"
