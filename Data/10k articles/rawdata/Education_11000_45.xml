'''Bahey El Din Barakat Pasha''' ({{Lang-ar|بهي الدين بركات باشا
}}) (1889–1972) was an Egyptian political figure.

Born in Menyat El Morshed village (in [[Kafr el-Sheikh Governorate]]), he studied in [[Cairo]] as well as in [[Paris]]. Originally a law teacher, he entered politics and was appointed [[Ministry of Education (Egypt)|Minister of Education]] twice during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hassan |first=Karima |date=24 August 2007|script-title=ar:عشرات الوزراء للتعليم في مصر خلال ٨٢ سنة فقط |trans-title=Dozens of ministers of education in Egypt in the span of 82 years only |journal=[[Almasry Alyoum]] |url=http://modernegypt.bibalex.org/DocumentViewer/TextViewer.aspx?w=1344&amp;h=646&amp;type=press&amp;id=1883&amp;s=1 |language=Arabic |format=Reprint |accessdate=2010-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure, a committee was established to facilitate [[Arabic grammar]] rules in order to make it easier for students to study in Arabic. He paid attention to the improvement of [[textbook]]s, and created an admission system for the High Institute of Education in 1938. In January of the same year, he inaugurated [[List of FM radio stations in Egypt|Egypt's radio broadcasting]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ministers of Education from the Kafr el-Sheikh Governorate | language = Arabic | publisher = Official website of the Kafr el-Sheikh Governorate | url = http://www.kafrelshiekh.gov.eg/p2.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-02 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080517162405/http://www.kafrelshiekh.gov.eg/p2.htm | archivedate = 2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A leading figure of the [[Wafd Party]] during [[Saad Zaghlul]]'s leadership as well as during the reign of King [[Farouk of Egypt|Farouk I]], Bahey El Din Barakat was elected [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the [[Parliament of Egypt|Chamber of Deputies]] on 12 April 1938, a position he held for a year and a half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Previous Presidents |publisher=Official website of the Egyptian People's Assembly |url=http://www.parliament.gov.eg/English/AboutTheParlmanet/Xpresidents/farok.htm |accessdate=2008-08-02 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barakat received the nobiliary title of ''[[Pasha]]'' on 15 February 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Pashas (1915-52) |url=http://www.egy.com/historica/pashalst.htm |accessdate=2008-08-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628164903/http://www.egy.com/historica/pashalst.htm |archivedate=2008-06-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He headed the [[Central Auditing Organization|Divan of Accounting]] from 1945 to 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Previous Chairmen |publisher=Official website of the Central Auditing Organization |url=http://www.cao.gov.eg/english/dpages_dpagesdetails.asp?ID=31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040624085349/http://www.cao.gov.eg/english/DPages_DPagesDetails.asp?ID=31 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-06-24 |accessdate=2008-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served on the three-member [[Regencies in Egypt|Regency Body]] that was formed following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|1952 Revolution]] to assume the powers of King [[Fuad II of Egypt|Fuad II]], who was barely six months old at the time.

==History==
This competition was created in 1987 and was called ''Championnat de France des jeux mathématiques et logiques'' (''French competition for mathematical and logical games'') at that time. Contestants could come from other countries, but the competition was entirely in French. It became ''Championnat International des Jeux Mathématiques et Logiques'' at its fourth edition (1990), but was still in French. Then it became more and more international, with the problems translated in more and more languages.

Since its beginning, this competition is organized by the French federation ''Fédération Française des Jeux Mathématiques'' (FFJM). But as it became international, federations were created in other countries and they take part in the organization.

The final of the first edition in 1987 took place in [[Parthenay]]. Since its second edition in 1988, the final has taken place in [[Paris]] or its suburb.

It was released in [[Japan]] on April 11, 2009.

==Plot== 
Eight months after triumphing over Serizawa Tamao ([[Takayuki Yamada]]), Takiya Genji ([[Shun Oguri]]) still struggles to attain supremacy at Suzuran All-Boys High School. Following a decisive defeat at the hands of the legendary Rindaman, and on the verge of graduating without fulfilling his goal, Genji grows quietly desperate. He begins challenging Rindaman regularly, but consistently fails to beat him. His situation escalates when he unwittingly breaks a non-aggression pact between Suzuran and a rival school, Housen Academy, by coming to the aid of Kawanishi Noboru ([[Shinnosuke Abe]]) during a heated confrontation. Genji learns that the agreement between the two schools was established two years prior when, during a skirmish, Noboru violated a [[Rules of engagement|gang law]] and used a weapon to fatally wound Housen's former leader, Bitō Makio. Suzuran had subsequently sworn not to interfere with Housen's retribution upon Noboru's release from prison. Genji's protection of Kawanishi provokes Housen's current leader, Narumi Taiga (Nobuaki Kaneko), to declare war against Suzuran. Genji and his allies go on the defensive, engaging in several violent conflicts with Housen's "Army of Killers".

==Reception==

===Box Office===
The film grossed [[US dollars|US]]$29,893,636 worldwide.&lt;ref name="BOM" /&gt;

===Critical reception===
Reviews of the film were generally positive. Niels Matthijs of ''[[Twitch Film]]'' gave it a positive review, saying, "Visually ''Crows Zero II'' is still looking incredibly slick. Maybe not as many landmark shots, but the dense and graffiti-laden backgrounds make for a tasty looking film alright. The fighting scenes are still a blast to behold too, with strong, intense and action-driven camera work and some tight editing to keep the adrenaline flowing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2009/10/crows-zero-ii-review.html|title=''Crows Zero II'' Review|publisher=[[Twitch Film]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Mark Schilling of ''[[The Japan Times]]'' gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, saying, "Miike directs with an energy, velocity and cheeky bravado that are pure punk. He also understands why his Suzuran toughs fight as easily as they breathe - it’s not just a release for their raging hormones, but a way of being with their friends and telling the world they exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2009/04/10/culture/crows-zero-ii/|title=''Crows Zero II'' Review|publisher=[[The Japan Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels &amp; Adaptations==
The film was followed by a sequel, ''[[Crows Explode]]'', in [[2014 in film|2014]]. It was also adapted into a [[manga]] entitled ''Crows Zero II: Suzuran x Housen'', illustrated by Hirakawa Tetsuhiro (writer of ''[[Clover (Tetsuhiro Hirakawa)|Clover]]'') and published in ''[[Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine|Bessatsu Shōnen Champion]]'' magazine.

A '''demonstration''' is action by a mass group or collection of groups of people in favor of a [[political]] or other cause or people partaking in a [[protest]] against a cause of concern; it often consists of walking in a mass march formation and either beginning with or meeting at a designated endpoint, or '''rally''', to hear speakers. Compare [[mass meeting]].

Actions such as blockades and [[sit-in]]s may also be referred to as demonstrations. Demonstrations can be [[nonviolent]] or [[violent]] (usually referred to by participants as "[[Militant (word)|militant]]"), or can begin as nonviolent and turn violent dependent on circumstances. Sometimes [[riot police]] or other forms of [[Law enforcement agency |law enforcement]] become involved. In some cases this may be in order to try to prevent the protest from taking place at all. In other cases it may be to prevent clashes between rival groups, or to prevent a demonstration from spreading and turning into a [[riot]].

The term has been in use since the mid-19th century, as was the term "monster [[meeting]]", which was coined initially with reference to the huge assemblies of protesters inspired by [[Daniel O'Connell]] (1775-1847) in Ireland.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations are a form of [[activism]], usually taking the form of a public gathering of people in a rally or walking in a '''march'''.  Thus the opinion is ''demonstrated'' to be significant by gathering in a crowd associated with that opinion.

Demonstrations can promote a viewpoint (either positive or negative) regarding a public issue, especially relating to a perceived [[grievance]] or [[social injustice]]. A demonstration is usually considered more successful if more people participate.

Historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] wrote of demonstrations: {{blockquote|Next to sex, the activity combining bodily experience and intense emotion to the highest degree is the participation in a mass demonstration at a time of great public exaltation. Unlike sex, which is essentially individual, it is by its nature collective… like sex it implies some physical action—marching, chanting slogans, singing—through which the merger of the individual in the mass, which is the essence of the collective experience, finds expression.&lt;ref&gt;

There are many types of demonstrations, including a variety of elements.  These may include:
*Marches, in which a [[parade]] demonstrate while moving along a set route.
*Rallies, in which people gather to listen to speakers or musicians.
*[[Picketing (protest)|Picketing]], in which people surround an area (normally an employer).
*[[Sit-in]]s, in which demonstrators occupy an area, sometimes for a stated period but sometimes indefinitely, until they feel their issue has been addressed, or they are otherwise convinced or forced to leave.
*[[Nudity and protest|Nudity]], in which they protest naked - here the antagonist may give in before the demonstration happens to avoid embarrassment.

Demonstrations are sometimes spontaneous gatherings, but are also utilized as a tactical choice by movements. They often form part of a larger campaign of [[nonviolent resistance]], often also called [[civil resistance]]. Demonstrations are generally staged in public, but private demonstrations are certainly possible, especially if the demonstrators wish to influence the opinions of a small or very specific group of people. Demonstrations are usually physical gatherings, but virtual or [[online]] demonstrations are certainly possible.

Topics of demonstrations often deal with [[politics|political]], [[economics|economic]], and [[society|social]] issues. Particularly with controversial issues, sometimes groups of people opposed to the aims of a demonstration may themselves launch a counter-demonstration with the aim of opposing the demonstrators and presenting their view. Clashes between demonstrators and counter-demonstrators may turn violent.

[[Government-organized demonstrations]] are demonstrations which are organized by a government. The [[Islamic Republic of Iran]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2004/11/9965bfb5-1917-4d01-a7b7-19d5de7692cd.html Analysis: Iran Sends Terror-Group Supporters To Arafat's Funeral Procession] "...state-organized rallies..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehedgefundjournal.com/commentary/index.php?articleid=23056981 Why Washington and Tehran are headed for a showdown] ''[[The Hedge Fund Journal]]'' 16 April 200&lt;/ref&gt; the [[People's Republic of China]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.asu.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9905e&amp;L=china-nn&amp;P=173 Global News, No. GL99-072] ''[[China News Digest]]'' June 3, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; [[Republic of Cuba]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washtimes.com/world/20060802-124603-7186r.htm Cubans ponder life without Fidel] ''The [[Washington Times]]'' 2 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Soviet Union]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinr.com/report.php?ac=view_report&amp;report_id=249&amp;language_id=1 "Democracy in the Former Soviet Union: 1991-2004"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004853/http://www.pinr.com/report.php?ac=view_report&amp;report_id=249&amp;language_id=1 |date=September 27, 2007 }} ''Power and Interest News Report'' 28 December 2004  &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Argentina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clarin.com/zona/Militancia-terreno_0_745725575.html|title= Militancia todo terreno: Sacan a presos de la cárcel para actos del kirchnerismo|trans-title=All-terrain militants: Prisoners are taken out of jail to take part in Kirchnerist demonstrations|language= Spanish|author= Nicolás Pizzi|date= 2012-07-29|work= |publisher= Clarín|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other nations, have had government-organized demonstrations.

==Times and locations==

[[File:Jasmine Revolution in China - Beijing 11 02 20 crowd.jpg|thumb|220px|Crowd in front of a McDonald's in [[Wangfujing]] on the [[2011 Chinese pro-democracy protests]]]]
Sometimes the date or location chosen for the demonstration is of historical or cultural significance, such as the [[anniversary]] of some event that is relevant to the topic of the demonstration.
[[File:Peace March for Hungary - 2013.10.23 (43).JPG|thumb|Demonstration at the Andrássy avenue - Budapest]]
Locations are also frequently chosen because of some relevance to the issue at hand.  For example, if a demonstration is targeted at issues relating to foreign [[nation]], the demonstration may take place at a location associated with that nation, such as an [[embassy]] of the nation in question.

== Nonviolence or violence ==
[[File:Rally Against Asset Sales, Palmerston North, 14 July 2012 07.JPG|thumb|220px|right|A nonviolent protest in New Zealand]]
Protest marches and demonstrations are a common nonviolent tactic. They are thus one tactic available to proponents of strategic [[nonviolence]]. However, the reasons for avoiding the use of violence may also derive, not from a general doctrine of [[nonviolence]] or [[pacifism]], but from considerations relating to the particular situation that is faced, including its legal, cultural and power-political dimensions: this has been the case in many campaigns of [[civil resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009, especially at pp. 14-20.[https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s] Includes chapters by specialists on the various movements.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some demonstrations and [[protests]] can turn, at least partially, into [[riot]]s or mob [[violence]] against objects such as [[automobile]]s and [[business]]es, bystanders and the [[police]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Police and military authorities often use [[non-lethal force]] or less-lethal weapons, such as [[Electroshock gun|tasers]], [[rubber bullet]]s, [[pepper spray]], and [[tear gas]] against demonstrators in these situations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  Sometimes violent situations are caused by the preemptive or offensive use of these weapons which can provoke, destabilize, or escalate a conflict.

As a known tool to prevent the infiltration by [[agents provocateurs]],&lt;ref&gt;Stratfor (2004) ''[http://www.stratfor.com/radical_anarchist_groups_pose_their_own_threat Radical, Anarchist Groups Pose Their Own Threat]'' published by [[Stratfor]], June 4, 2004 quote: &lt;blockquote&gt;Another common tactic is to infiltrate legitimate demonstrations in the attempt to stir widespread violence and rioting, seen most recently in a spring anti-Iraq war gathering in Vancouver, Canada. This has become so commonplace that sources within activist organizations have told STRATFOR they police their own demonstrations to prevent infiltration by fringe groups.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the organizers of large or controversial assemblies may deploy and coordinate [[demonstration marshal]]s, also called stewards.&lt;ref name="OCSE2007"&gt;Belyaeva et al.

==Law by country==

{{expand section|date=August 2015}}

===Brazil===
[[Freedom of assembly]] in [[Brazil]] is granted by art. 5th, item XVI, of the [[Constitution of Brazil]] (1988): [http://bd.camara.gov.br/bd/bitstream/handle/bdcamara/1344/constituicao_ingles_4ed.pdf?sequence=19 Constitution of Brazil - Text in English].

===Egypt===
{{Main article|Egyptian protest law}}

===Russia===
{{Main article|Freedom of assembly in Russia}}
[[Freedom of assembly]] in the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] is granted by Art. 31 of the [[Constitution of the Russian Federation|Constitution]] adopted in 1993: &lt;blockquote&gt;Citizens of the Russian Federation shall have the right to gather peacefully, without weapons, and to hold meetings, rallies, demonstrations, marches and [[Picketing (protest)|pickets]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russianembassy.org/RUSSIA/CONSTIT/chapter2.htm Chapter 2 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Demonstrations and protests are further regulated by the Federal Law of the Russian Federation No.54-FZ "''On Meetings, Rallies, Demonstrations, Marches and Pickets''". If the assembly in public is expected to involve more than one participant, its organisers are obliged to notify executive or local self-government authorities of the upcoming event few days in advance in writing. However, legislation does not foresee an authorisation procedure, hence the authorities have no right to prohibit an assembly or change its place unless it threatens the security of participants or is planned to take place near hazardous facilities, important [[Rail transport in Russia|railway]]s, [[viaduct]]s, [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]s, [[high voltage#Power lines|high voltage electric power lines]], [[prison]]s, [[court]]s, presidential residences or in the border control zone. The right to gather can also be restricted in close proximity of cultural and historical monuments.

===Singapore===
{{Main article|Public demonstrations in Singapore}}
Public demonstrations are rare in [[Singapore]], where it is illegal to hold cause-related events without a valid licence from the authorities. Such laws include the Public Entertainment and Meetings Act and the Public Order Act.

===Ukraine===
{{Main article|Anti-protest laws in Ukraine}}

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Manifs à londres contre la guerre en irak.JPG|right|thumb|220px|Demonstration in front of the [[British parliament]]]]
Under the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]] and the [[Terrorism Act 2006]], there are areas designated as 'protected sites' where people are not allowed to go. Previously, these were military bases and nuclear power stations, but the law is changing to include other, generally political areas, such as [[Downing Street]], the [[Palace of Westminster]], and the headquarters of [[MI5]] and [[MI6]]. Previously, [[trespasser]]s to these areas could not be arrested if they had not committed another crime and agreed to be escorted out, but this will change following amendments to the law.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Steven, "[https://www.theguardian.com/monarchy/story/0,,2041802,00.html New powers against trespassers at key sites]", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 24 March 2007. Retrieved on 23 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human rights]] groups fear the powers could hinder peaceful protest. [[Nick Clegg]], the then [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] home affairs spokesman, said: "I am not aware of vast troops of trespassers wanting to invade MI5 or MI6, still less running the gauntlet of security checks in [[Whitehall]] and Westminster to make a point. It's a sledgehammer to crack a nut." [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]], the [[civil liberties]] pressure group, said the measure was "excessive".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Colin, "[http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/legal/article2611749.ece  No-go Britain: Royal Family and ministers protected from protesters by new laws]", ''[[The Independent]]'', 4 June 2007. Retrieved on 23 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution]] specifically allows peaceful demonstrations and the [[freedom of assembly]] as part of a measure to facilitate the redress of such grievances.  "Amendment I: Congress shall make no law ... abridging ... the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html|title=America's Founding Documents|date=30 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A growing trend in the [[United States]] has been the implementation of "[[free speech zone]]s," or fenced-in areas which are often far-removed from the event which is being protested; critics of free-speech zones argue that they go against the First Amendment of the [[United States Constitution]] by their very nature, and that they lessen the impact the demonstration might otherwise have had. In many areas it is required to get permission from the government to hold a demonstration.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3984">{{about|the instructional model known as 'distributed learning'|learning that is spaced only over time|spacing effect}}

'''Distributed learning''' is an instructional model that allows instructor, students, and content to be located in different, noncentralized locations so that instruction and learning can occur independent of time and place. The distributed learning model can be used in combination with traditional classroom-based courses and traditional distance education courses (in which it is also deferred to as [[blended learning]], or it can be used to create entirely virtual classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://education.alberta.ca/teachers/resources/connection/archive/may-2010/curriculum/dlearn.aspx|title = Distributed Learning|date = February 23, 2015|accessdate = February 23, 2015|website = Distributed Learning|publisher = Government of Alberta|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/dist_learning/|title = Distributed Learning|date = February 23, 2015|accessdate = February 23, 2015|website = Distributed Learning|publisher = Province of British Columbia|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

There is much confusion globally over distinctions between and definitions of distributed learning, [[distance education]], [[open learning]], [[e-learning]], [[blended learning]] and other related terms. Many terms are used more commonly in particular geographies.  Distinctions can arise when the chosen model focuses on either or both time and geographic distances.  Distributed learning may be dependent on time if it includes synchronous sessions and further time dependent if the course is paced. The oldest and most commonly used of these terms, [[distance education]], can be used to describe distributed learning as defined above. 'Distributed education' lacks a correspondence school tone and history and thus is perceived as making more use of communications and especially synchronous communications technologies. Further research using both terms 'distance' and 'distributed education' returns better results with consider overlap.

Distributed learning is viable option for many individuals of all ages who desire to get an education. It holds a number of advantages and a traditional learning environment.

==Advantages==
# Opportunities to study

## No interaction with teachers and professors
## Lack of seriousness, competition and learning environment
## Programmed instruction may be isolated &amp; separated from daily practice
## Programmed instruction does not give opportunity to work on oral communication skills
## Absence of a teacher or an instructor

==Collaboration==
Distributed learning relies on collaboration to share knowledge.

== Technology==
Distributed learning relies on technology to share, store, retrieve, and extend knowledge.

==Distributed cognition==
Distributed cognition is an outcome of distributed learning (Mindmaps, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;MindMaps (2015). Distributed Cognition and Learning. From https://mindmaps.wikispaces.com/Distributed+Cognition+and+Learning#distlvc. Retrieved October 31, 2015.

'''Educational accreditation''' is a type of [[quality assurance]] process under which services and operations of educational institutions or programs are evaluated by an external body to determine if applicable standards are met. If standards are met, accredited status is granted by the appropriate agency.

In most countries the function of educational [[accreditation]] is conducted by a government organization, such as a Ministry of Education. In the [[United States]] a quality assurance process exists that is independent of government and performed by private non-profit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Marjorie Peace Lenn, [http://www.wes.org/ewenr/wenrarchive/QA_HighEdQualAssTrendsSpr92.pdf Global Trends in Quality Assurance in Higher Education], ''World Education News &amp; Reviews'', v. 5, no. 2, Spring 1992, pages 1 and 21&lt;/ref&gt; Those organizations are formally called accreditors. All accreditors in the US must in turn be recognized by the [[National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity]] (NACIQI), which is an advisory body to the [[U.S. Secretary of Education]], in order to receive federal funding and any other type of federal recognition. Therefore, the federal government is the principal architect and controlling authority of accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Eaton, [http://www.chea.org/Research/president-letters/2016-06-24-naciqi-statement.html A Statement from Judith Eaton President, Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) ], "CHEA, CIQG", Research, president-newsletters, June 24, 2016, paragraph 6&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. accreditation process was developed in the late 19th century and early 20th century after educational institutions perceived a need for improved coordination and articulation between [[secondary education|secondary]] and post-secondary educational institutions, along with standardization of requirements between the two levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middlestates.org/History.html The History of the Middle States Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924155446/http://www.middlestates.org/History.html |date=2010-09-24 }}, [[The Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] website, accessed October 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northcentralassociation.org/HISTORY%20OF%20THE%20NORTH%20CENTRAL%20ASSOCIATION.htm History of the North Central Association], [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] website, accessed October 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advanc-ed.org/what-accreditation What Is Accreditation?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907071332/http://www.advanc-ed.org/what-accreditation |date=2010-09-07 }}, [[AdvancED]] website, accessed October 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Higher education accreditation==
{{main|Higher education accreditation}}
Accreditation of [[higher education]] varies by jurisdiction and may be focused on either or both the institution or the individual programs of study.

[[Higher education accreditation in the United States]] has long been established as a [[peer review]] process coordinated by accreditation commissions and member institutions. The federal government began to play a limited role in [[higher education]] accreditation in 1952 with the reauthorization of the [[GI Bill]] for [[Korean War]] [[military veteran|veterans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chea.org/pdf/RecognitionWellman_Jan1998.pdf |title=Recognition of Accreditation Organizations: A Comparison of Policy &amp; Practice of Voluntary Accreditation and The United States Department of Education |publisher=CHEA |date=January 1998 |accessdate=2009-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615135829/http://chea.org/pdf/RecognitionWellman_Jan1998.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the creation of the U.S. Department of Education and under the terms of the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]], as amended, the [[U.S. Secretary of Education]] is required by law to publish a list of [[nationally recognized accrediting agencies in the United States|nationally recognized accrediting agencies]] for higher education.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Educational games in the ''Sonic'' series}}
As the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series of [[platform game]]s has grown in popularity, its publisher [[Sega]] has expanded the franchise into multiple different genres. Among these are several [[educational video game]]s designed to appeal to young children. The first attempt to create an educational ''Sonic'' game was [[Tiertex Design Studios]]' ''Sonic's Edusoft'' for the [[Master System]] in late 1991, which was canceled despite having been nearly finished. When Sega launched the [[Sega Pico]] in 1994, it released ''Sonic the Hedgehog's Gameworld'' and ''Tails and the Music Maker'' for it. [[Orion Pictures|Orion Interactive]] also developed the 1996 [[Sega PC]] game ''Sonic's Schoolhouse'', which used a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[game engine]] and had an exceptionally large marketing budget. In the mid-2000s, [[LeapFrog Enterprises]] released educational ''Sonic'' games for its [[Leapster]] and [[LeapFrog Didj]].

==History==
''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' is one of the bestselling video game franchises ever,{{sfn|Harris|2014|p=386}} selling over 80 million units for the combined series as of 2011.&lt;ref name="VideoGamerGenerations"/&gt; [[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|The original game]], a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]], was developed by [[Sonic Team]] in Japan. Released by [[Sega]] in 1991, it greatly increased the popularity of the [[Sega Genesis]] in North America and established Sega as [[Nintendo]]'s main rival in the console market.&lt;ref name="1UPEssential50"/&gt;{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=24—29}} With the game's popularity, the series began to expand into other genres. While ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'' began development in late 1991, the Manchester-based [[Tiertex Design Studios]] began to work on an [[educational video game]] set in the ''Sonic'' universe called ''Sonic's Edusoft'' for the [[Master System]]. ''Edusoft'' was made using sprites ripped from the original game. Despite having been nearly finished, it was canceled. The game was not licensed by Sega, but the company did express interest in it and could have potentially published it jointly with [[US Gold]].&lt;ref name="SMSPowerEdusoft"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RetroGamerEdusoft"/&gt;

In 1994, Sega released the [[Sega Pico]], an "[[edutainment]]" device powered by the same hardware used by the Genesis.&lt;ref name="Sega-16Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AllGamePico"/&gt; The system was designed appear similar to a laptop, a stylus called the "Magic Pen", and a pad to draw on.{{sfn|GamePro|1994|p=80}} As [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] had become Sega's mascot, Sega released two educational games featuring characters from the ''Sonic'' franchise, ''Sonic the Hedgehog's Gameworld'' and ''Tails and the Music Maker''.&lt;ref name="AllGamePico"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AllGameTails"/&gt; ''Gameworld'' was developed by [[Aspect Co.]],&lt;ref name="AllGameGameworld"/&gt; the studio that produced the majority of the [[Game Gear]] ''Sonic'' games.&lt;ref name="USgamerWho?"/&gt; Another educational game, ''[[Wacky Worlds Creativity Studio]]'', was released for the Genesis in 1994. Though it is not a ''Sonic'' game, Sonic does feature in it.&lt;ref name="JeuxvideoOther"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AllGameWacky"/&gt;

In 1996, Sega and [[Orion Pictures|Orion Interactive]] collaborated to produce ''Sonic's Schoolhouse'', an educational game in the [[Sega PC]] brand for [[Microsoft Windows]]. It was developed using a [[game engine]] similar to ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]''{{'}}s and ten educators and psychologists helped create the game's challenges.&lt;ref name="HG101Schoolhouse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SegaOrionAnnouncement"/&gt; A cartoon clock was originally the star of the game but was replaced with Sonic; thus, ''Sonic's Schoolhouse'' is only tenuously connected to the rest of the franchise.&lt;ref name="HG101Schoolhouse"/&gt; The game was released as part of Sega's {{USD}}20 million "Blue is Back" marketing campaign to promote six ''Sonic'' games releasing in the [[holiday shopping season]]; advertisements for the game were run in magazines and it was promoted in store displays. ''Sonic's Schoolhouse'' also came bundled coupons worth {{USD}}40 in discounts for ''Sonic'' merchandise, including comics and plush toys.&lt;ref name="SegaOrionAnnouncement"/&gt;

In the mid-2000s, [[LeapFrog Enterprises]] published two educational ''Sonic'' platformers: [[Torus Games]]' ''Sonic X'' and [[Realtime Associates]]' ''Sonic the Hedgehog'', for the [[Leapster]] and [[LeapFrog Didj]], respectively.&lt;ref name="SonicXAmerica"/&gt;{{sfn|LeapFrog Enterprises|2008}}

==Games==
===''Sonic's Edusoft''===
* Release date: Unreleased (developed in 1991)
* Developer: [[Tiertex Design Studios]]
* Planned publishers: {{hlist|class=inline|[[Sega]]|[[US Gold]]}}
* Platform: [[Master System]]
''Sonic's Edusoft'' would have been the first educational ''Sonic'' game, the series' third entry overall, and the first ''Sonic'' game that was not developed in Japan. The game was aimed at five-year-olds&lt;ref name="SMSPowerEdusoft"/&gt; and centers around a series of [[minigame]]s that feature math and spelling questions. Minigames are accessed from an [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric]] hub world and more non-educational games can be unlocked after a certain number of educational ones are beaten.&lt;ref name="RetroGamerEdusoft"/&gt; The game was virtually unknown until one of the game's programmers created a [[Wikipedia]] page about it, which was [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|deleted]] after being deemed a hoax. The programmer later emailed screenshots to ''Sonic'' [[fansite]]s but was unable to prove it was real. ''Edusoft'' was confirmed to be real after its [[ROM image]] was eventually leaked.&lt;ref name="RetroGamerEdusoft"/&gt;

===''Sonic the Hedgehog's Gameworld''===
* Release date: {{Video game release hlist|class=inline|JP|August 1994&lt;ref name="IgromaniaGameworld"/&gt;|NA|November 1996&lt;ref name="AllGameGameworld"/&gt;}}
* Developer: [[Aspect Co.]]
* Publisher: Sega
* Platform: [[Sega Pico]]
''Sonic the Hedgehog's Gameworld'' was the first of two ''Sonic'' games to be released for the Sega Pico.&lt;ref name="AllGamePico"/&gt; The game takes the form of a [[picture book]] and changes the set of tasks the player must accomplish when a page is turned. Aimed at children ages four to seven, ''Gameworld'' stars Sonic, [[Tails (character)|Tails]], and [[Amy Rose|Amy]] and features 13 minigames that are designed to teach the player problem solving.&lt;ref name="AllGamePico"/&gt;{{sfn|Sega|1996|p=3}}

===''Tails and the Music Maker''===
* Release date: {{Video game release hlist|class=inline|NA|September 1994&lt;ref name="AllGameTails"/&gt;}}
* Developer: [[Appaloosa Interactive]]{{efn|Then known as Novotrade International}}&lt;ref name="AllGameTails"/&gt;
* Publisher: Sega
* Platform: Sega Pico
''Tails and the Music Maker'' was the second ''Sonic'' game to be released for the Sega Pico. It features Tails and is designed to teach children ages three to seven about making music.{{sfn|Sega|1994|p=1}} ''Tails and the Music Maker'' uses the same picture book form that ''Gameworld'' uses.{{sfn|Sega|1994|p=2—3}} The game features several minigames, including "Travels with Tails" (in which the player guides Tails through three levels) and "Percussion Pinball" (in which Tails is placed in a [[pinball]] environment).{{sfn|Sega|1994|p=6—9}}

===''Sonic's Schoolhouse''===
* Release date: {{Video game release hlist|class=inline|NA|October 1996&lt;ref name="SegaOrionAnnouncement"/&gt;}}
* Developer: [[Orion Pictures|Orion Interactive]]
* Publisher: Sega
* Platform: [[Microsoft Windows]]
''Sonic's Schoolhouse'' is aimed at children aged five to nine{{sfn|Coach Kyle|1996|p=100}} and takes place in a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] environment viewed from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]].&lt;ref name="HG101Schoolhouse"/&gt; The gameplay has been likened to ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' (1993),&lt;ref name="SegaOrionAnnouncement"/&gt; but the primary difference is that players must solve spelling, math, and reading questions in several difficulty levels based on age group. Sonic is not playable, instead acting as a guide.&lt;ref name="HG101Schoolhouse"/&gt;

===''Sonic X''===
* Release date: {{Video game release hlist|class=inline|NA|2005&lt;ref name="SonicXAmerica"/&gt;|EU|2007&lt;ref name="SonicXEurope"/&gt;}}
* Developer: [[Torus Games]]
* Publisher: [[LeapFrog Enterprises]]
* Platform: [[Leapster]]
''Sonic X'' is based on the [[anime]] series [[Sonic X|of the same name]] and was released by LeapFrog Enterprises for the Leapster handheld game console. It stars Sonic and a boy named Chris, who must save Tails, Amy, and [[Knuckles the Echidna|Knuckles]] from [[Doctor Eggman]]. The player must guide Sonic through three levels, periodically stopping to answer math questions. The three levels, Station Square, [[Angel Island (Sonic the Hedgehog)|Angel Island]], and Eggman's base feature [[sequencing]], [[addition]], and [[subtraction]] respectively.{{sfn|LeapFrog Enterprises|2005|p=2—3}}

===''Sonic the Hedgehog''===
* Release date: {{Video game release hlist|class=inline|NA|2008{{sfn|LeapFrog Enterprises|2008}}}}
* Developer: [[Realtime Associates]]
* Publisher: LeapFrog Enterprises
* Platform: [[LeapFrog Didj]]
The Didj version of ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' is a side-scrolling platformer similar to the original Genesis ''Sonic'' games, but has numerous minigames that are designed to teach spelling. It is aimed at children ages seven to ten.{{sfn|LeapFrog Enterprises|2008}}

==Reception==
''[[Jeuxvideo.com]]'' regarded the educational ''Sonic'' games as obscure.&lt;ref name="JeuxvideoOther"/&gt; According to the programmer who worked on ''Sonic's Edusoft'', the game was tested at a [[primary school]] in [[Didsbury]], Manchester and was well-received. ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' expressed disappointment that it remained relatively unknown and offered praise for its "chunky" visual style. They also wondered "if the kids realised how lucky they were to get to play an unreleased and often forgotten Sonic game".&lt;ref name="RetroGamerEdusoft"/&gt; Reviewing ''Sonic's Schoolhouse'', ''Hardcore Gaming 101'' was strongly negative, calling it "a bare-bones edutainment title" that "offer[s] neither education or entertainment of any sort."&lt;ref name="HG101Schoolhouse"/&gt; They criticized its [[voice acting]], visuals, lack of difficulty and educational value, and poor use of the ''Sonic'' license, deeming it a "rather cynical attempt from Sega to tie it in with their mascot" and urging readers to instead play the Leapster games.&lt;ref name="HG101Schoolhouse"/&gt; ''[[GamesRadar+]]'' said ''Sonic's Schoolhouse'' was only "vaguely educational" and "a grade-schooler's nightmare."&lt;ref name="GRadar59in10"/&gt;

'''''Exploring Music''''' is an internationally syndicated radio program featuring [[classical music]], with commentary and analysis by host [[Bill McGlaughlin]]. It is a daily, one-hour show with a single in-depth theme each week. The show, which debuted in 2003, is produced by [[WFMT]] Radio Network. ''Exploring Music'' is in many ways the heir to the late [[Karl Haas]]' popular long-running show, ''[[Adventures in Good Music]]'', expanded and updated for a 21st-century audience.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;Williams, David.

==Program description==

''Exploring Music'' delves into a wide variety of topics in classical music, and each five-program, one-week series has a single theme. Weekly themes have included weeklong studies of the music of dozens of [[composer]]s, explorations of various [[:Category:Composers by nationality|cultures]], [[List of musical movements|styles]], [[List of musical forms|forms]], and [[History_of_music#Western_art_music|time periods]], and dozens of other topics and areas of exploration.

A very small sampling of weekly topics includes such themes as:&lt;ref name="playlists"&gt;[http://www.exploringmusic.org/playlists.htm Themes and Playlists, 2003 to present]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Beethovensmall.jpg|right|thumb|140px|[[Beethoven]] themes have included: ''Late Beethoven'', ''Beethoven and the Piano'', ''[[Template:Beethoven string quartets|Beethoven Quartets]]'', and ''Beethoven and that Danged Metronome''.]]

Over two dozen classical composers — e.g. [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Bartók]], [[Grieg]], [[Debussy]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], [[Stravinsky]], and [[Leonard Bernstein|Bernstein]] — have also had weekly themes devoted exclusively to their lives and music. These programs are intimate biographies which include the composer's early life, education, historical and musical influences, personal life, and emotional and musical development, plus numerous musical pieces each day. Several composers, including [[Schubert]], [[Brahms]], [[Tchaikovsky]], [[Mahler]], [[Verdi]], and [[Shostakovich]], have had a two-week theme devoted to their lives and works. [[Bach]], [[Mozart]], and [[Beethoven]] have each had several series centered around their works. Approximately one week per month is devoted to the life and works of a single composer.  

''Exploring Music'' is geared to all ages and to any level of musical knowledge. Host Bill McGlaughlin guides the listener into the music through various means: revealing the stories behind compositions, adding analysis and illustrations at the piano, exploring  the interlocking nature of music and ideas, referencing the historical context of pieces and trends, and also giving his insight as a professional musician, conductor, and composer. 
 
Each week McGlaughlin weaves a deepening narrative around the topic at hand, and aims to make exploring classical music fun. "Drawing people inside the music seems the clue to me," he says. "Human beings are wired for delight when we figure something out."&lt;ref name="chat"&gt;Burkholder, Steve. [https://www.webcitation.org/5bnROTFYk?url=http://www.chicagoclassicalmusic.org/2007_feb08_Bill_McGlaughlin "Chicago Classical Music Chat with Bill McGlaughlin."] ''Chicago Classical Music.'' March 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally music from other genres — such as jazz, ethnic/world music, folk/traditional music, or pop standards — is aired, to liven up the discussion and illustrate points. 

The piano is another tool McGlaughlin frequently employs to get concepts across. Of his original decisions about the show's format, McGlaughlin says, "It’s very hard to talk about music on the radio unless you can hear a sound, so I said I need a piano. Instead of saying 'a [[minor third]],' I can play it. I wanted to make certain that what you could hear was prominent."&lt;ref name="TO" /&gt;

==Inception and history==

In 2002, Steve Robinson, Vice President of [[WFMT]] Radio Network, approached [[Peabody Award]]-winner [[Bill McGlaughlin]] to host a new daily radio show, which would showcase and explicate great works of classical music.&lt;ref name="TO"&gt;Manning, Bryant. [https://archive.is/20081024000021/http://www.timeout.com/chicago/articles/opera-classical/36621/bills-excellent-venture "Bill’s Excellent Venture: Radio Host Brings Arias and Masses to the Masses."] ''Time Out Chicago.'' Issue 175: Jul 3–9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; McGlaughlin had spent 22 years as host and music director of ''[[Saint Paul Sunday]]'', the nationally syndicated weekly [[chamber music]] performance and interview show. His credentials also included decades as a professional musician, conductor, and composer. Regarding his choice of McGlaughlin as host, Steve Robinson stated, "As far as I'm concerned, no one can top Bill in the way he conveys his passion for music on the radio."&lt;ref name="chat" /&gt; 

Development of the new program was funded by a special grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], in November 2002.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.exploringmusic.org/bill2.htm ''Exploring Music'' Official Site – Bill McGlaughlin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307124734/http://www.exploringmusic.org/bill2.htm |date=2008-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show debuted nationally on October 6, 2003.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; ''Exploring Music'' in essence replaced [[Karl Haas]]' long-running show, ''[[Adventures in Good Music]]'',&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FineArts"/&gt; since the aging and retired Haas had recorded no new episodes of his show after 2002. When encore broadcasts of ''Adventures in Good Music'' ceased entirely on June 29, 2007, ''Exploring Music'' gained an even wider national listenership, as it was then scheduled in the retired show's time slot on many radio stations.

In 2013, after repeated requests from listeners and following years of negotiation with recorded-music copyright lawyers, ''Exploring Music'' reached ground-breaking legal agreements which allow it to stream any of its past shows on demand from its site.&lt;ref name=listen /&gt;&lt;ref name=wgte /&gt;

==Popular and critical reception==

[[Image:Bach.jpg|right|thumb|135px|''Exploring Music'' has delved into ''[[Bach]]'s Secular Works'', his ''[[Mass in B Minor|B-Minor Mass]]'', his ''[[St. Matthew Passion]]'', and, in December, his ''[[Christmas Oratorio]]''.]]
McGlaughlin's highly informed, yet relatable and enthusiastic presentation has appealed to radio audiences of all ages, including younger listeners.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Steve. [http://www.chicagoclassicalmusic.org/node/525 "Drawing Kids to Classical."] ''Chicago Classical Music: BackStage Blog''. May 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Steve. [http://www.current.org/music/music0505classical.shtml "Look Around a Little — You’ll Find Plenty of Life in Classical Music Radio."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306145932/http://www.current.org/music/music0505classical.shtml |date=2009-03-06 }} ''Current''. March 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Chicago Tribune'' music critic John von Rhein, "Bill McGlaughlin's folksy but informed manner as host of the popular radio series ''Exploring Music'' has pulled thousands of listeners into the classical experience."&lt;ref&gt;von Rhein, John. "Classical Mission Brings Radio Host Out of the Studio." ''Chicago Tribune'', July 4, 2008. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Executive Producer Steve Robinson reported in 2007:
:The e-mail is always over the top. In my 40 years doing classical music radio I've never seen anything like it.... The letters range from a person who had never heard a string quartet before and wanted to know where to buy one, to a listener who graduated from [[Juilliard]] and found [Bill's] comments on [[Ravel]] to be enlightening!&lt;ref name="chat" /&gt; 

As of 2013, ''Exploring Music'' had over 400,000 listeners to the live show.&lt;ref name=cr /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stars" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MIC" /&gt; 

===Honors===
Host and music director Bill McGlaughlin received the Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004 from Fine Arts Radio International, which stated that, "''Exploring Music'', with its weekly thematic concept, provides the classical radio listener with both in-depth education and compelling radio listening, a balance that is rarely achieved."&lt;ref name="FineArts" /&gt; 

The show also garnered Bill McGlaughlin and producer Steve Robinson the Dushkin Award from the Music Institute of Chicago, in 2008.&lt;ref name="MIC" /&gt; 

In 2011, in presenting McGlaughlin their Lifetime Achievement Award, the Association of Music Personnel in Public Radio noted that "Bill McGlaughlin’s incredibly knowledgeable but always inviting and warm presence can ... be heard on ''Exploring Music'', a daily program begun in 2002 in which he guides listeners to discover the heart, soul and humor of the music he plays."&lt;ref&gt;[http://amppr.org/wordpress/bill-mcgloughlin-receives-lifetime-achievement-award "Bill McGlaughlin Receives Lifetime Achievement Award"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119192933/http://amppr.org/wordpress/bill-mcgloughlin-receives-lifetime-achievement-award/ |date=2011-11-19 }}. The Association of Music Personnel in Public Radio.  May 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and distribution==

Since McGlaughlin lives in [[New York City]], and the [[WFMT]] production studio is in [[Chicago]], production of ''Exploring Music'' occurs in two locations. After choosing a topic, McGlaughlin does extensive research at the [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center Library for the Performing Arts]], and via his own resources such as the 30-volume ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''.&lt;ref name=houston&gt;Ward, Charles. [http://www.chron.com/entertainment/article/McGlaughlin-brings-voice-to-Chamber-Choir-1676280.php "McGlaughlin Brings Voice to Chamber Choir: Q&amp;A"]. ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''. April 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cr /&gt;&lt;ref name=princeton&gt;Strauss, Elaine. [http://www.princetoninfo.com/index.php?option=com_us1more&amp;Itemid=6&amp;key=06-03-2009%20McGlaughlin "Exploring &amp; Celebrating the Uncommon Music"]. ''U.S. 1''. June 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicago producers collect 30 to 50 hours of relevant music selection samples, with their liner notes, from WFMT's extensive library in Chicago, and send them to McGlaughlin — by making low-resolution [[MP3]] files of them, burning them onto DVDs, and [[FedEx]]ing them. In New York, the team at radio station [[WQXR-FM|WQXR]] also combs their music library for more possibilities, and places the audio into [[iTunes]] for McGlaughlin to review.&lt;ref&gt;Siegmund, Bill. [http://blogs.wfmt.com/exploringmusic/2009/01/12/news-from-the-audio-department/ "News from the Audio Department."] ''Exploring Music'' blog. January 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:Mozart Lange.png|right|thumb|150px|[[Mozart]] series: ''Mozart in Vienna'', ''Mozart at his Zenith'', ''[[Mozart piano concertos|Mozart's Piano Concertos]]'', and ''Mozart's Birthday Bash''.]]
After sorting through and choosing which music selections to present, and finalizing his research and ideas, McGlaughlin then records the voice-track portion of the week's five one-hour shows, in the studios of WQXR in New York. The recording session is monitored in real time in Chicago via either [[ISDN]] or telephone. This allows McGlaughlin, his New York recording engineer, and the Chicago producers to interact freely, as if they were all in the same recording studio. McGlaughlin often voices the same narration section multiple ways, attempting to find the most concise and entertaining way to present the information, which also gives the producers editing options when they finalize each show. 

The voice-track audio files for the week's five shows are then sent to Chicago, where they are edited for time, and the high-resolution music selections are added in. This [[post-production]] process involves making artistic choices regarding which of Bill's narration samples to use, and how to present and place Bill's piano examples, snippet examples from CDs, and the musical pieces themselves. Choices are also made with timing in mind; extra movements or an extra unannounced musical snippet at the end of the show are added if a show runs short.&lt;ref name="making"&gt;[http://www.exploringmusic.org/behind.htm The Making of an ''Exploring Music'' Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

Once each program is completed, a CD is made and given to the WFMT [[uplink]] department. The show is then distributed to radio stations around the country three ways: Physical duplicates are made of the master CD and shipped and the show is uploaded to the Public Radio Exchange (PRX) server for automatic internet distribution. Listeners nationwide and even worldwide are then able to hear ''Exploring Music'', either broadcast on their local radio station, or via the internet through any one of over 30 online radio stations.

==Listening options==

''Exploring Music'' airs daily on 55 public and commercial radio stations in the U.S.&lt;ref name=cr /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://exploringmusic.wfmt.com/listen-to-the-show/where-to-listen Station listings]&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Australia]], ''Exploring Music'' airs on [[3MBS]] at 9 AM, and on [[4MBS]] at 7 PM; in [[Guam]] it airs on [[KPRG]] at 10 AM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kprgfm.com/main/index.php?key=schedule KPRG program grid]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Faculty of General Dental Practice''' (FGDP(UK)) was formed in 1992 as the academic home for general dental practitioners in the United Kingdom. It opened its membership up to Dental Care Professionals (DCPs) in 2005, and now supports the whole dental team. As of December 2015 there are approximately 5000 members of the FGDP(UK). It is based at the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]]. Around 95% of the dental care in the UK is provided in the primary dental care setting. The FGDP(UK) looks after the continuing professional development (CPD) and training needs of both dentists and dental care professionals (DCPs) working in this field. Membership of the FGDP(UK) is open to all dentists, dental surgeons and dental care professionals registered with the General Dental Council.

==Aims==
The Faculty has stated aims around improving standards of patient care and promote excellence in dentistry. It attempts to achieve this by leading, supporting and providing standards for all members of the primary care dental team throughout their careers in all matters relating to their clinical practice.

==Education==
The Faculty is involved in aspects of dental care in general practice and primary dental care centres in general, it runs courses for training and continuous development of dentist and dental professionals.

The Faculty awards post graduate qualifications in dentistry including [[MJDF]]. A two-year postgraduate diploma program in restorative dentistry, and a two-year postgraduate program in implant dentistry.

==Books and publications==
{{main|Primary Dental Journal}}
The ''[[Primary Dental Journal]] (PDJ)'' is the journal of the Faculty of General Dental Practice (UK). Launched on 4 October 2012, the quarterly, themed professional development journal replaces previous publications Primary Dental Care, Team in Practice and First-Hand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fgdp.org.uk/publications/primarydentalcare.ashx&lt;/ref&gt; Each issue focuses on a key topic in primary care dentistry and offers a combination of research, clinical best practice papers and scenario articles which allow the whole dental team to work together to improve standards of patient care. Many standards in dentistry are set by Faculty. Based on these standards, the FGDP(UK) publishes a range of Standards books for UK dentistry.

==Professional Development for Dental Care Professionals (DCPs)==
[[Continuing Professional Development|Professional Development for Dental Care Professionals (DCPs)]] was formerly known as Key Skills in Primary Care Assessment for DCPs, until it was relaunched in 2014 as a distance learning CPD programme in the skills identified as vital to the provision of a high level of patient care.  DCPs present a portfolio of evidence reflecting on their own activities and working practices relating to each Key Skill.  This programme carries up to 80 hours of CPD and subject areas covered include medical emergencies, infection control, radiography and dental materials.

==Research==
It is one of the aims of FGDP(UK) to improve the standard of patient care through research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dental Care|url=http://www.teeth-implants.co.uk/restoration/dentalcare|website=Teeth Implants|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. To date, very little research has been performed in primary dental centres. To improve this situation FGDP(UK) has developed an infrastructure throughout the country to provide primary care dentists and their dental teams with local sources of advice on oral healthcare research. A network of Divisional Research Facilitators (DRFs) has been established throughout the UK.

'''#FeesMustFall''' was a student-led protest movement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Book provides in depth analysis of #FeesMustFall movement |url=http://www.702.co.za/articles/322133/book-provides-in-depth-analysis-of-feesmustfall-movement |website=702 co Za |publisher=702 co Za |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that began in mid-October 2015 in South Africa. The goals of the movement were to stop increases in student fees as well as to increase government funding of universities. The movements were started and led by the SRC and Jewish Students Union leader of the University of Witwatersrand of 2015, Shaeera Kalla. On 2 October Kalla attended her last council meeting as SRC president, she is accompanied by Nompendulo as an observer heading towards being the incoming SRC President of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.enca.com/south-africa/no-fee-increase-spread-other-varsities|title=Protests grow over university fee hikes {{!}} eNCA|website=enca.com|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests started at the [[University of Witwatersrand]] and spread to the [[University of Cape Town]] and [[Rhodes University]] before rapidly spreading to other universities across the country.&lt;ref name="EWNshutdown"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ewn.co.za/2015/10/19/Fee-protests-shuts-down-3-of-SAs-biggest-universities | title=TUITION FEE PROTESTS SHUT DOWN 2 OF SA'S BIGGEST UNIVERSITIES | publisher=Eye Witness News | date=19 October 2015 | accessdate=22 October 2015 |author1=Masa Kekana |author2=Lauren Isaacs |author3=Emily Corke }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 protest ended when it was announced by the South African government that there would be no tuition fee increases for 2016. The protest in 2016 began when the South African Minister of Higher Education announced that there would be fee increases capped at 8% for 2017; however, each institution was given the freedom to decide by how much their tuition would increase.

By October 2016, the Department of Education estimated that the total cost in property damage due to the protest since 2015 had amounted to R600&amp;nbsp;million (equivalent to US$44.25&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rdm.co.za/politics/2016/10/31/cost-of-feesmustfall-now-r1bn-says-universities-official|title=Cost of #FeesMustFall now R1bn, says universities official|last=Reporters|first=Staff|website=Rand Daily Mail|access-date=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The protests followed a three-day student lock-down of the University of Witwatersrand campus the week before following an announcement by the university that fees would be increasing by 10.5% in the following year&lt;ref name="Wits17Oct2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ewn.co.za/2015/10/17/Wits-University-suspends-10-point-5-percent-fee-hike|title=WITS UNIVERSITY SUSPENDS 10.5 PERCENT FEE HIKE|date=17 October 2015|publisher=Eye Witness News|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite an inflation rate of only around 6% for the same year.  The university's chief financial officer stated that the cause of the high increase in fees was:

{{quote|1. The rand-dollar exchange rate has fallen by approximately 22%, which has resulted in a substantial increase in the amount of money that we pay for all library books, journals, electronic resources, research equipment that are procured in dollars and euros.

2. Salary increases for academics are set at 7% based on a three-year cycle and these increases are necessary to ensure that we retain the best intellectual minds in the country.

3. Generic inflation is hovering at around 6% which impacts on all other expenses that the University has to cover.

4. Utilities are increasing at rates substantially higher than the inflation rate.&lt;ref name="MustKnow19Oct"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mg.co.za/article/2015-10-19-four-things-you-need-to-know-about-feesmustfall#.Vih8l2qxP0o.facebook | title=What you need to know about #FeesMustFall | publisher=[[Mail and Guardian]] | date=19 October 2015 | accessdate=22 October 2015 | author=Quintal,Genevieve}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the focus of the protests was focused on a rise in fees a number of factors formed the background for the protests from a lack of funding for poorer students to attend university, high incomes for University managers,&lt;ref name="HighVarsityPay"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://businesstech.co.za/news/general/101654/what-vice-chancellors-at-south-africas-top-universities-earn/ | title=What vice-chancellors at South Africa's top universities earn | publisher=Business Tech | date=20 October 2015 | accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a real decline in government funding for higher education,&lt;ref name="RealEduDecline"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/news-and-analysis/behind-the-university-funding-crisis | title=Behind the university funding crisis | publisher=Democratic Alliance | date=19 October 2015 | accessdate=22 October 2015 | author=Belinda Bozzoli}}&lt;/ref&gt; lack of social transformation, to broader socio-economic and racial inequality issues.&lt;ref name="PoliticalFailureTrigger"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2015-10-21-feesmustfall-political-failure-triggers-ticking-time-bomb/ | title=#FeesMustFall: Political failure triggers ticking time bomb | work=[[Daily Maverick]] | date=21 October 2015 | accessdate=22 October 2015 | author=Munusamy, Ranjeni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vice chancellor of the University of Witwatersrand [[Adam Habib]] estimated that if government could provide an extra R8&amp;nbsp;billion per year "that will cover the tuition fees of every student at every university in the country."&lt;ref name="Fresh Tuition Talks"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ewn.co.za/2015/10/18/Fresh-tuition-talks-begin-at-Wits-today | title=FRESH TUITION TALKS BEGIN AT WITS TODAY | publisher=Eye Witness News | date=19 October 2015 | accessdate=22 October 2015 |author1=Ziyanda Ngcobo |author2=Thando Kubheka |author3=Emily Corke }}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa spends 0.75% of its GDP on tertiary education which is less than the African or world average.&lt;ref name="MaxduPreez"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news24.com/Columnists/MaxduPreez/Protesting-students-need-our-support-20151020?isapp=true | title=Protesting students need our support | publisher=[[News24]] | date=20 October 2015 | accessdate=22 October 2015 | author=[[Max du Preez|du Preez, Max]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline 2015 ==

=== 12–19 October ===
Students at the University of Witwatersrand started protesting on 14 October 2015 in response to an announcement by the university that fees would be raised by 10.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.enca.com/south-africa/wits-fee-increase-suspended|title=Wits fee increase suspended|last=Sello|first=Lenyaro|website=''enca.com''|access-date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a sit in and lock down of the university by students and some staff that, on 17 October, resulted in the university agreeing to suspend the fee increase and renegotiate it as well as not seek disciplinary action against participating students or staff members.&lt;ref name="No Punishment for protesting students"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ewn.co.za/2015/10/17/No-punishment-planned-for-protesting-Wits-students | title='NO PUNISHMENT PLANNED' FOR PROTESTING WITS STUDENTS | publisher=Eye Witness News | date=17 October 2015 | accessdate=22 October 2015 | author=Masego Rahlaga}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday 18 October messages started circulating on Facebook about a possible complete shut down of the Rhodes University campus.

=== 19 October ===
By Monday 19 October fresh negotiations between students and the university had begun.&lt;ref name="Fresh Tuition Talks" /&gt; On the same day similar protests had spread to the University of Cape Town and Rhodes University.&lt;ref name="EWNshutdown" /&gt; On the same day management at the University of Cape Town -which had announced a 10.3% fee increase the week before- applied for and received a court interdict to prevent protests at the university.  Students started blocking vehicle access by placing rocks, dustbins, and benches on the roads leading into the campus.&lt;ref name="MustKnow19Oct" /&gt;

Students went ahead and led by the [[Rhodes Must Fall]] movement occupied the university's administration building.&lt;ref name="UCTprotestoverfees"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/western-cape/uct-students-to-protest-over-fees-1.1931927 | title=UCT students to protest over fees | work=[[Cape Times]] | date=19 October 2015 | accessdate=22 October 2015 | author=Carlo Petersen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riot police were called to forcibly evict the protesters with over 25 students being arrested late at night.  Reportedly over a thousand students then gathered at the Rondebosch police station and held an all night vigil calling for the student's release.&lt;ref name="ImraanChristian"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://10and5.com/2015/10/20/imraan-christians-firsthand-account-of-the-feesmustfall-protest-at-uct/ | title=Imraan Christian's Firsthand Account of the #FeesMustFall Protest at UCT | publisher=10and5.com | date=20 October 2015 | accessdate=23 October 2015 | author=Christian, Imraan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Rhodes University students reportedly started barricading themselves into the university and forcibly turning away others from entering the campus.  Students at the University of Pretoria reportedly initiated plans to lock down three of that university's campuses for Wednesday 21 October.&lt;ref name="MustKnow19Oct" /&gt;

=== 20 October ===

On Tuesday 20 October students assembled at the University of Cape Town and marched down to the local police station to demand that the students that were arrested the previous night be released. The [[Cape Peninsula University of Technology]] students started protesting and locked down the campus.  At the [[Fort Hare University]] students also began protests and a campus lock down. They refused to disperse or write exams until university management had dealt with concerns over fee increases and issues of corruption.&lt;ref name="TensionsCPUT"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ewn.co.za/2015/10/20/Tensions-flare-at-CPUT-and-Fort-Hare-fee-protests | title=PROTESTS CONTINUE AT CPUT &amp; FORT HARE, TENSIONS FLARE | publisher=Eye Witness News | date=20 October 2015 | accessdate=23 October 2015 |author1=Xolani Koyana |author2=Masa Kekana }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students at the [[University of Stellenbosch]] handed over a memorandum of grievances to university management outlining their complaints whilst students at Rhodes University continued their protests.&lt;ref name="SABC20oct"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/2322ba004a46d4b1a110fb6d39fe9e0c/More-police-arrests-as-student-protests-intensifies-20152010 | title=More police arrests as student protests intensify | publisher=[[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] | date=20 October 2015 | accessdate=23 October 2015 |author1=Berenice Moss |author2=Lynne Arendse |author3=Jamaine Krige }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the University of Witwatersrand students rejected a proposed compromise by the university to cap fee increases at 6% and instead demanded that there be no increase in fees.&lt;ref name="news24WitsReject"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/LIVE-Students-continue-protest-over-university-fees-20151020 | title=Students reject 6% cap, Wits remains closed for the week – As it happened | publisher=[[News24]] | date=20 October 2015 | accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Wednesday 21 October 2015 students from both the University of Cape Town as well as the Cape Peninsula University of Technology formed a crowd of around 5,000 protesters&lt;ref name="iolStudentPower"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/riot-police-vs-student-power-1.1933836#.VikYJ_mqpBc | title=Riot police vs student power | publisher=IOL News | date=22 October 2015 | accessdate=23 October 2015 | author=Political Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; marched on the [[Parliament of South Africa|South African Parliament]] which coincided with the meeting of the National Assembly -with both Higher Education Minister [[Blade Nzimande]] and President [[Jacob Zuma]] in attendance- which was in session to hear the medium-term budget.  Following the finance minister's address, Nzimande tried to address the crowd but was repeatedly booed by the crowd whilst President Zuma left the Parliamentary buildings from a side entrance.  Other parliamentarians were advised by the speaker of the house to wait out the protests in their offices.

Protesters broke through the gates of the parliamentary precinct and began to stage a sit-in protest, but riot police soon moved in to disperse them using [[stun grenades]], [[tasers]], coloured gas, riot shields and truncheons.  After the riot police had cleared the precinct of protesters and shut the gates, police warned protesters that they were contravening the [[National Key Points Act, 1980|National Key Points Act]] and that if they do not disperse with in 15 minutes, they will be arrested.  The protesters did not leave, and police went ahead and arrested a number of them.

During the morning university vice chancellors and student representatives met with President Jacob Zuma in Pretoria to negotiate a way forward. Whilst they were meeting, a large group of protesting students assembled outside the [[Union Buildings]] to await Zuma's response.

In mid-August 2016, the [[Minister of Higher Education and Training (South Africa)|Minister of Higher Education and Training]] was widely expected to announce fee structures for the 2017 academic year.

Later in the day Minister for Higher Education, [[Blade Nzimande]] called for calm stating that no decision had (yet) been reached about fees.

South African president Jacob Zuma instructs Finance Minister [[Pravin Gordhan]] to "find the money" to ensure a 0% increase in 2017. This came despite [[National Treasury (South Africa)|National Treasury]]'s warning that this was unaffordable and Nzimande's earlier position that universities needed at least a 6% increase to avoid "collapse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=#FeesMustFall: 'Find the money', says Zuma |author=S'thembile Cele |newspaper=City Press|location=South Africa |date=21 August 2016 |access-date=2 September 2016 |url=http://city-press.news24.com/News/feesmustfall-find-the-money-says-zuma-20160821}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students conducted a feasibility study with an independent source and it was found that R60 Billion was lost in corruption annually and that free education at the same standard as it is paid (facilities, lectures etc.) would only cost R45 Billion annually.

At 11AM Blade Nzimande announced that university fees would increase in 2017, but increases would be capped at 8%. He emphasized that [[university council]]s would make the final decisions about fees. However he went on to say that the government was still engaging with stakeholders to come up with a way to provide financial assistance to students with annual family incomes of below R600,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2016-09-19-blade-nzimande-says-fees-can-go-up-but-not-beyond-8 |title=Blade Nzimande says fees can go up, but not beyond 8% |newspaper=Mail &amp; Guardian |date=19 September 2016 |access-date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an immediate response, students at the [[University of Witwatersrand]] mobilised to shut down their campus, blockading entrances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ewn.co.za/2016/09/19/Wits-student-leaders-call-for-campus-shutdown |title=Wits student leaders call for campus shutdown |author=Ziyanda Ngcobo |newspaper=Eyewitness News |date=19 September 2016 |access-date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters claimed that all protest would be peaceful; however, they turned to violence when vehemently denied entrance to the Great Hall by heavily armed riot police.

On 10 October students at the University of Witwatersrand gathered at the Great Hall, an area on the campus. The students were denied access to the hall by private security. They were soon replaced by the South African Police Force. In order to disperse the protesters the police fired rubber bullets, stun grenades and smoke grenades. 2 students were injured and 11 were arrested by police (recorded at approximately 11:00). By the afternoon the students started throwing rocks.

== Police Brutality ==
{{Disputed section|date=December 2017}}
During the #feesmustfall protests, [[Police brutality]] on students reached an all-time high, many newspaper sources were even quoted saying that it reminded them of the [[Sharpeville massacre|Sharpville Massacre]]. Police who were deployed at the University of the Witwatersrand during this time did not hesitate to use brutal force on students.&lt;ref&gt;The Journalist&lt;/ref&gt; Police used [[stun grenade]]s, [[rubber bullet]]s, [[Tear gas|teargas]] and [[Water cannon|water canons]] to disperse students on the East side of the campus. While students remained calm, three days into the 2016 protest, students reacted to the police brutality and reacted by throwing rocks at the police.&lt;ref name="Daily Maverick"&gt;Daily Maverick&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Muhamelwa]] who was part of the logistics team behind the movement was one of those targeted by police in 2016 where they drove him around for hours interrogating him about the movement and the whereabouts of other student leaders such as [[Shaeera Kalla]], [[Mcebo Dlamini]] and [[Fasiha Hassan]]. #Feesmustfall leaders (in both 2015 and 2016) were all shot with rubber bullets and in particular the outgoing SRC president of 2015, Shaeera Kalla, was shot 9 times with rubbet bullets at close range when she turned her back on police at the forefront of protests last year.&lt;ref name="GroundUp"&gt;GroundUp&lt;/ref&gt; During this heightened period of brutality against students, the police denied these allegations of targeting student leaders. [[South African Police]] Spokesperson stated that police were reminded to "exercise maximum restraint and act within the limits of the law."{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name="GroundUp"/&gt;

On 18 October 2016, it was said by students demonstrating at the University of Witwatersrand, that police officers were targeting leaders to weaken the movement. there alleged claims of students being abducted, abused and then dumped into [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name="Daily Maverick"/&gt; Wits student Arthur Muhamelwa was arrested by police on Sunday, who proceeded to abduct him. Police drove him around for hours, whilst student leaders looked for him at Hillbrow, Jeppe and Cleveland police stations. the Student representative (SRC) council started #WhereIsArthur on Facebook. Arthur realised he was in some danger, he typed in an SMS seen by [[Daily Maverick]], "Something here is not right, i'm still on a moving police quantum passing a board written [[Bela-Bela|Bela Bela]] and [[Polokwane]] and a board written welcome to [[Limpopo]]." this was just before 20:00 on Sunday evening. the Police proceeded to strip Arthur naked as well as torture him. he was then abandoned by the police Near a river in [[Thohoyandou, Limpopo]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} This and many other allegations were made by students and student leaders, who were adamant that the police was targeting leaders and intimidating them to quiet down protests. The Police force denied all allegations.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=link to article needed}}&lt;ref name="Daily Maverick"/&gt;

Brutality was a big topic for debate since the general public either claimed the students were to blame due to their unprovoked violence, therefore giving police authority to use force, or the police were to blame, apparently using force while being unprovoked by students, resulting in student violence and destruction.

The initial impact of the protests was to prevent any raise in university tuition in 2016.  The protests resulted in the guarantee by national government of free higher education for students leading to the creation in 2018 of a national bursary scheme for poor and working class students totalling R12.4-billion in 2018 with the bursary budget expected to increase to R24.3-billion in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2018-02-21-finally-how-government-plans-to-fund-free-education|title=Finally: How government plans to fund free education|last=Tshwane|first=Tebogo|work=Mail &amp; Guardian|access-date=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the [[Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation]] concluded that the decolonisation focus of the 2016 protests was less successful than the 2015 protests; however the study concludes that the protests did bring the subject of decolonisation of educational institutions and the alienation of black students and staff from university life to broader public attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://csvr.org.za/pdf/An-analysis-of-the-FeesMustFall-Movement-at-South-African-universities.pdf|title=#Hashtag: An analysis of the #FeesMustFall Movement at South African universities|last=Sandile Ndelu, Yingi Edwin, Musawenkosi Malabela, Marcia Vilakazi, Oliver Meth, Godfrey Maringira, Simbarashe Gukurume and Muneinazvo Kujeke.|website=Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation|dead-url=|access-date=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Florence Adams was born in [[Danville, Kentucky]] on July 9, 1902. In 1925 she graduated from [[Knoxville College]].&lt;ref name="Notable"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adams, Florence V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20611">[[image:Doug Flutie US Open 2009 (cropped).jpg|thumb|300|Doug Flutie, the player who the phenomenon is named after]]
The '''Flutie effect''' or '''Flutie factor''' refers to the American phenomenon of having a successful college sports team increase the exposure and prominence of a [[university]]. This is named after [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]]'s [[Doug Flutie]], whose successful [[Hail Mary pass]] in [[Hail Flutie|the 1984 game]] against the [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]] clinched a win which allegedly played a large role in the increase in applications to [[Boston College]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/debate/freeexchange/2007/01/flutie_effect.cfm Economist blog article on Flutie effect]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-bcs22dec22,0,3538672.story?track=tottext LA Times article on Flutie effect]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westword.com/Issues/2000-12-07/news/sports.html Westword article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428040824/http://www.westword.com/issues/2000-12-07/news/sports.html |date=2005-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flutie Effect at Boston College==
Writing in the Spring 2003 edition of the ''[[Boston College Magazine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://bcm.bc.edu/issues/spring_2003/ll_phenomenology.html BC article on effect]&lt;/ref&gt; Bill McDonald, director of communications at Boston College’s [[Lynch School of Education]] determined that “Applications to BC did surge 16 percent in 1984 (from 12,414 to 14,398), and then another 12 percent (to 16,163) in 1985. But these jumps were not anomalous for BC, which in the previous decade had embarked on a program to build national enrollment using market research, a network of [[alumni]] volunteers, strategically allocated financial aid, and improvements to residence halls and academic facilities.” He also observed that “in 1997, one year after revelations about gambling resulted in a coach’s resignation, 13 student-athlete suspensions, an investigation by the NCAA, and hundreds of embarrassing media reports, applications for admission came in at 16,455, virtually unchanged from the previous year. Two years later, when applications jumped by a record 17 percent to 19,746, the surge followed a 4-7 year for football.” Going further back in history, he reported that applications had increased 9 percent in 1978, a year when [[Boston College Eagles football|BC football]] had its worst year ever, with a 0-11 record.

Mr. McDonald posed the question “How does an idea like the 'Flutie factor' become sufficiently rooted that ''[[The New York Times]]'' cites it as a given without further comment and some universities invest millions of dollars in its enchanting possibilities?” He was provided with an answer by [[Barbara Wallraff]], author of the “[[Word Court]]” column in ''[[The Atlantic|The Atlantic Monthly]]'': “It’s painful to fact-check everything. Media will often reprint what has been published, especially when it appears in reputable publications. ‘Flutie factor’ is a short, alliterative way to describe something that is complicated to explain. But what makes a good term is not always the literal truth.”

==Other examples==
According to a 2009 study, applications to a university that had its men's basketball team play in the first round of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] rose by an average of 1% the following year. Teams with greater success saw larger rises; tournament winners typically saw applications increase by 7 to 8%. As most schools did not raise enrollment after participating in the tournament, the greater number of applications caused them to be more selective in their admissions.{{r|dosh201203}}

===Gonzaga===
One alleged "Flutie Effect", this one related to [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|men's basketball]], occurred at [[Gonzaga University]] at the turn of the 21st century. In the mid-1990s, freshman enrollment hovered around 500 students annually, including a total of 569 as late as 1998.&lt;ref name="Withers118"&gt;{{harvnb|Withers|2002|pp=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longtime school benefactor Jack McCann, who had joined the school's board of trustees that year, would say in a 2017 interview that "the school was in real trouble." Gonzaga's undergraduate enrollment had dropped from over 4,000 in 1990 to just under 2,800 in 1998. The school had operated at a deficit for several years, saw declines in its credit rating and a shrinking endowment, and had steadily reduced its staffing. A few faculty members suggested that Gonzaga athletics drop from [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] to a lower level.&lt;ref name="O'Neil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/119205/how-the-basketball-program-helped-gonzaga-university-flourish |title=How the basketball program helped Gonzaga University flourish |first=Dana |last=O'Neil |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=March 29, 2017 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1998–99 school year, [[1998–99 Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team|Gonzaga]] made an unexpected run to the Elite Eight of the [[1999 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1999]] [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], and freshman enrollment jumped to 701 that August.&lt;ref name="Withers118"/&gt; The Bulldogs won two games in each of the [[2000 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|next]] [[2001 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|two]] NCAA Tournaments, as freshman enrollment increased to 796 in 2000 and to a then-record 979 in 2001.&lt;ref name="Withers118"/&gt; In 2004, Rev. Robert Spitzer, then Gonzaga University president, said that the team's success was responsible for the school receiving the $23 million required to build the Bulldogs' current basketball home of [[McCarthey Athletic Center]], most of which was received through major gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.matr.net/article-10265.html | title = Score! Gonzaga University was struggling financially. Then it started winning basketball games. | last = Lieber | first = Ron | date = 2004-03-14 | newspaper = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | accessdate = 2010-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most schools that have experienced this phenomenon, Gonzaga has been seen as continuing to reap benefits from its basketball program, even two decades removed from the team's first major exposure to a national audience. In March 2017, as the [[2016–17 Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team|Bulldogs]] were preparing to play in the program's first Final Four, ESPN writer Dana O'Neil said, "What has happened at Gonzaga is a lot more than the Flutie Effect." In 2003, with freshman enrollment booming, Gonzaga changed from a rolling admissions process to a more selective process with firm deadlines. This led to a noticeable increase in incoming student credentials, with median high school [[Grade Point Average|GPAs]] rising from 3.54 in 1998 to 3.71 in 2016 and median [[SAT]] scores rising from 1159 to 1290 in the same period. The McCarthey Athletic Center is only one of seven major buildings that opened on campus between 2004 and 2017, and at that time the school had started to build a new basketball practice facility and was preparing to break ground on a new performing arts center. Donations have also risen; by the time of O'Neil's piece, a fundraising campaign that had only started in 2016 had already received $226 million of its $250 million goal. Finally, undergraduate enrollment for 2016–17 was 5,160, with more than 1,200 freshmen.&lt;ref name="O'Neil"/&gt;

===George Mason===
Another school alleged to have experienced the "Flutie Effect" was [[George Mason University]], following their [[2005–06 George Mason Patriots men's basketball team|2005–06]] [[George Mason Patriots men's basketball|basketball team]]'s advancement to the [[Final Four]] of the [[2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] as an 11th seed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sports.yahoo.com/top/news;_ylt=AnOExRLwZFYMv8etc5cvU0A5nYcB?slug=ap-flutieeffect&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns 'Flutie Effect' study shows success on fields and courts really does mean more applications - Yahoo! Sports&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appalachian State===
[[file:Armanti Edwards Throw.jpg|thumb|200px|Armanti Edwards]]
[[Appalachian State University]] had a "Flutie Effect" after winning multiple [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I FCS championships]] and [[2007 Appalachian State vs. Michigan football game|upsetting Michigan]] with [[Armanti Edwards]] as their quarterback. Five years after the Michigan game, ''[[CBSSports.com]]'' writer Dennis Dodd claimed that it was "tied directly to a 17 percent increase in applicants, a 24 percent boost in attendance and a 73 percent rise in licensing royalties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/story/19866497/five-years-ago-app-state-changed-it-all-but-whats-really-new-today |title=Five years ago, App State changed it all, but what's really new today? |first=Dennis |last=Dodd |publisher=''CBSSports.com'' |date=August 22, 2012 |accessdate=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boise State===
[[Boise State University]] experienced an effect similar to the "Flutie Effect" after their 43-42 overtime victory over [[2006 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] in the [[2007 Fiesta Bowl]]. The game capped [[2006 Boise State Broncos football team|an undefeated season]] and a top-5 finish by Boise State, a team not considered to be a traditional football power. Online inquiries about the school increased 135 percent, and graduate school application inquiries increased tenfold. Boise State also enrolled over 19,000 students the next fall, an all-time high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/January-2008/The-Colt-Effect/ |title=The Colt Effect |first=David |last=Croxford |publisher=Hawaii Business |date=January 2008 |accessdate=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern Iowa===
Another school that was reported to have experienced a similar "Flutie Effect" as a result of a basketball accomplishment was the [[University of Northern Iowa]]. In the [[2010 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2010 NCAA Tournament]], the [[2009–10 Northern Iowa Panthers men's basketball team|Panthers]] sprang an upset of top-ranked [[2009–10 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]]. The game and the national exposure that went with it led to massive increases in donations, website traffic, and e-commerce for the athletic department, and a 30 percent increase in calls to UNI's admissions office on the Monday after the upset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/columns/story?columnist=oneil_dana&amp;id=5436566 |title=Northern Iowa: The Shot and The Effect |first=Dana |last=O'Neil |publisher=ESPN.com |date=August 4, 2010 |accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Butler===
Two studies estimated that television, print, and online news coverage of [[Butler University]]'s [[Butler Bulldogs men's basketball|men's basketball team]]'s [[2009–10 Butler Bulldogs men's basketball team|2010]] and [[2010–11 Butler Bulldogs men's basketball team|2011]] appearances in the NCAA tournament championship game resulted in additional publicity for the university worth about $1.2 billion. In an example of the "Flutie Effect", applications rose by 41% after the 2010 appearance.&lt;ref name="dosh201203"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post?id=53175 | title=Tournament pays handsomely for schools | work=ESPN | date=March 2012 | accessdate=March 30, 2012 | first=Kristi |last=Dosh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oregon===
Beginning in the early-2000s, the [[University of Oregon]] experienced a massive increase in incoming freshman applications and merchandise sales mainly due to the massive success of the [[Oregon Ducks football|Oregon Ducks]] football team and other athletic teams. The Ducks football team has experienced exponential success since the early-2000s, consistently being ranked in the top 25 national polls, winning multiple [[List of Pac-12 Conference football champions|Pac-12 Conference]] championships, appearing in several [[Bowl Championship Series]] Bowl games, and participating in two National Championship games. They are currently regarded as one of the premier college football programs in the country and are annually considered a national championship contender. Furthermore, the rise to prominence of [[Heisman Trophy]] winner, [[Marcus Mariota]], led to an increase in incoming freshman applications and merchandise sales at the school. The school also benefited from a drastic overhaul of the entire athletic department's uniforms and sports apparel, which was spearheaded by sports apparel and equipment manufacturer, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. Nike's headquarters are located in [[Oregon]] and company founders, [[Phil Knight]] and [[Bill Bowerman]], are alumni of the university. The appearance, design, and quality of the Nike athletic apparel and equipment at Oregon is regarded as one of the most appealing, popular, and unique merchandise concepts in college athletics. Additionally, the construction of multiple state-of-the-art athletic training and performance facilities on campus has drastically increased campus appeal to top-notch athletic prospects and recruits, as well as incoming student applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/cfp/the-scene/20150111-oregon-takes-full-advantage-of-the-flutie-effect.ece | title=Oregon takes full advantage of the 'Flutie Effect' | work=Dallasnews.com| date=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auburn===
There was a "dramatic increase" in the number of applications to [[Auburn University]] after its [[2010 Auburn Tigers football team|football team]], led by [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Cam Newton]], won the [[2011 BCS National Championship Game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blog.al.com/wire/2011/03/auburn_sees_surge_in_applicati.html | title=Auburn sees surge in applications after national championship | work=AL.com | date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baylor===
[[Baylor University]] reported a drastic increase in student applications after [[Robert Griffin III]] won the [[Heisman Trophy]] in 2011 and led the [[2011 Baylor Bears football team|Bears football team]] to their best record in over 30 years. The Bears' football team has had continued success throughout the 2010s, winning two [[Big 12 Conference]] championships and participating in two [[Bowl Championship Series]] Bowl games. Led by head coach [[Art Briles]], Baylor's football program has developed into one of the premier college football programs in the country. Due to the massive surge in student applications, school enrollment, and merchandise and apparel sales, Baylor drastically overhauled and refurbished the school's athletic facilities, including the construction and opening of [[McLane Stadium]] in 2014, which cost approximately $266 million to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/heisman-trophy/index.ssf/2014/12/the_heisman_trophy_effect_what.html | title=The Heisman Trophy effect: What a Marcus Mariota win could do for the Oregon Ducks | work=oregonlive.com | date=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virginia Commonwealth===
Yet another "Flutie Effect" from men's basketball was experienced by [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] following the [[2010-11 VCU Rams men's basketball team|Rams' Final Four run]] in the [[2011 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2011 NCAA Tournament]]. The Rams basketball team, after receiving a play-in seed in the tournament, went on a legendary run defeating powerhouses [[2010–11 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|Georgetown]] and number 1 seed [[2010–11 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]], before losing to [[2010–11 Butler Bulldogs men's basketball team|Butler]] in the Final Four. The school saw a 20% increase in applications after their 2011 appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.educationdive.com/news/how-march-madness-success-boosted-admissions-for-5-universities/234331/ | title=How March Madness success boosted admissions for 5 universities | work=educationdive.com | date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florida Gulf Coast and Wichita State===
Two schools experienced similar effects following runs in the [[2013 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2013 NCAA Tournament]]. Within a year of [[Florida Gulf Coast University|Florida Gulf Coast's]] [[2012–13 Florida Gulf Coast Eagles men's basketball team|Sweet Sixteen run]], sales of men's basketball-related merchandise increased more than 20-fold, the total number of applications to the school increased by 36%, and out-of-state applications increased 41%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://grantland.com/features/fgcu-eagles-ncaa-basketball-dunk-city-no-more/ | title=Life After Dunk City | first=Jordan Ritter |last=Conn |publisher=[[Grantland]] | date=February 19, 2014 | accessdate=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wichita State University|Wichita State]] saw applications rise by 81% after the [[2012–13 Wichita State Shockers men's basketball team|Shockers made the Final Four]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/16702550/coastal-carolina-championship-brought-clemson-south-carolina-fans-together | title=Coastal championship brings rivals together to celebrate history | first=Ryan |last=McGee |publisher=''ESPN.com'' | date=July 2, 2016 | accessdate=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texas A&amp;M===
During the early 2010s, Texas A&amp;M experienced an increase in incoming freshman applications and merchandise sales due mainly to the rise to national prominence and mainstream success of the [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies football|Texas A&amp;M Aggies]] football team. The Aggies were led by breakout freshman quarterback and [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Johnny Manziel]]. The Aggies finished with an 11-2 record and a #5 national ranking during the [[2012 Texas A&amp;M Aggies football team|2012 season]], and a 9-4 record and #18 national record during the  [[2013 Texas A&amp;M Aggies football team|2013 season]]. According to a study, Manziel was worth over $37 million in media exposure and merchandise sales and the school bookstore had sold out all 2,500 of their replica Aggies jerseys.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.valleyadvocate.com/2013/08/28/johnny-football-the-flutie-effect-and-the-myth-of-college-athletics-amateurism/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loyola–Chicago===
[[Loyola University Chicago]] experienced significant increases in freshman applications following [[2017–18 Loyola Ramblers men's basketball team|a surprise run]] to the [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2018 Final Four]]. The school enrolled its largest freshman class ever in the 2018–19 school year, at over 2,900. While this was an increase of only 4.1% from the previous year, Loyola's admissions director told the institution's student newspaper, the ''Loyola Phoenix'', that the full effect of the Final Four run would not be seen until the 2019–20 school year because the NCAA tournament takes place late in Loyola's admissions calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://loyolaphoenix.com/2018/08/after-magical-march-culture-change-comes-to-loyola/ |title=After Magical March, Culture Change Comes to Loyola |first1=Nick |last1=Schultz |first2=Abigail |last2=Schnable |newspaper=Loyola Phoenix |date=August 22, 2018 |accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; New visitors to the university's website increased more than four-fold during the Ramblers' upset of [[2017–18 Tennessee Volunteers basketball team|Tennessee]] during the Final Four run, and visits to the undergraduate admissions page increased by more than 50% during that same game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/ct-met-loyola-basketball-university-publicity-20180321-story.html |title=With NCAA success, Loyola now looks for gains off the court |first=Dawn |last=Rhodes |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=March 21, 2018 |accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''German orthography reform of 1996''' (''{{lang|de|Reform der deutschen Rechtschreibung von 1996}}'') was a change to [[German spelling]] and punctuation that was intended to simplify German orthography and thus to make it easier to learn,&lt;ref name=Upward&gt;{{cite journal |last=Upward |first=Chris |title=Spelling Reform in German |journal=Journal of the Simplified Spelling Society |year=1997 |volume=J21 |pages=22–24, 36 |url=http://spellingsociety.org/uploaded_journals/j21-journal.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905063542/http://spellingsociety.org/uploaded_journals/j21-journal.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; without substantially changing the rules familiar to users of the language. 

The reform was based on an international agreement signed in Vienna in July 1996 by the governments of the [[German-speaking countries]]—[[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Switzerland]]. [[Luxembourg]] did not participate despite having German as one of its three official languages: it regards itself "as a non-German-speaking country not to be a contributory determinant upon the German system of spelling",&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|Othon Neuen}}, spokesman for the Luxembourg Ministry of Education in a statement in August 2004: "{{lang|de|Leider hätte Luxemburg als nicht deutschsprachiges Land kein Recht darauf, mit zu entscheiden, in welche Richtung es nun weitergehe ...}}", ''{{lang|de|[[Luxemburger Wort]]}}'', 9 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; though it did eventually adopt the reform.

The reformed [[orthography]] became obligatory in schools and in public administration. However, there was a campaign against the reform, and in the resulting public debate the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] was called upon to delineate the extent of reform.  In 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.bverfg.de/entscheidungen/rs19980714_1bvr164097.html |title=Bundesverfassungsgericht, Urteil vom 14. Juli 1998, Az.: 1 BvR 1640/97 |publisher=[[Federal Constitutional Court]] |language=German |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; the court stated that because there was no law governing orthography, outside the schools people could spell as they liked, including the use of traditional spelling. In March 2006, the [[Council for German Orthography]] agreed unanimously to [[#Later developments|remove the most controversial changes]] from the reform; this was largely, though not completely, accepted by media organizations such as the ''{{lang|de|[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]}}'' that had previously opposed the reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Dagmar |last=Giersberg |url=http://www.goethe.de/ges/spa/siw/en630493.htm |title=Chronicle of a Long Debate: The Spelling Reform |date=December 2007 |accessdate=29 September 2011 |publisher=[[Goethe-Institut]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules of the new spelling concern the following areas: correspondence between [[phonemic orthography|sounds and written letters]] (this includes rules for spelling [[loan word]]s), capitalisation, joined and separate words, hyphenated spellings, punctuation, and hyphenation at the end of a line. Place names and family names were excluded from the reform.

==New rules==

===Sounds and letters===
[[Image:RechtschreibreformBeiStrassennamen.jpg|thumb|right|This street sign in [[Aachen]] shows a very rare example of a name being changed after the orthography reform of 1996. Spellings in names were, in almost all cases, not changed. Note the old version on the wall.]]
[[Image:Flussschifffahrt.svg|thumb|right|The word now spelt ''{{lang|de|Flussschifffahrt}}'' typeset in [[Fraktur]] (thus containing the [[long s]]) as written before the reform, according to the typesetting rules published shortly after the reform,&lt;ref&gt;[[Duden]], {{lang|de|Die deutsche Rechtschreibung}}, 21st edition (1996), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; and according to the currently (2011) recommended typesetting rules.&lt;ref&gt;Duden, {{lang|de|Die deutsche Rechtschreibung}}, 25th edition (2009), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The reform aimed to systematise the correspondence between sounds ([[phoneme]]s) and letters ([[grapheme]]s), and to strengthen the principle that derived forms should follow the spelling of the root form.

'''ß and ss:''' In reformed orthography the grapheme {{lang|de|[[ß]]}} (a modernised typographical rendering of how ''{{lang|de|sz}}'' appeared in traditional [[Blackletter|Gothic script]]; it is seldom used in Switzerland) is considered a separate letter that is to appear only after long vowels and [[diphthongs]]. In general in German, long stressed vowels are followed by single consonants, and short stressed vowels by double consonants. In the traditional orthography, ''{{lang|de|ß}}'' was written instead of ''{{lang|de|ss}}'' if the ''s'' phoneme belonged to only one [[syllable]], thus in terminal position and before consonants ''{{lang|de|ss}}'' was always written as ''{{lang|de|ß}}'', without regard to the length of the preceding vowel. In the reformed orthography, a short stressed vowel is never followed by ''{{lang|de|ß}}''. This brings it into line with the two-letter spelling of other final consonants (''{{lang|de|-ch, -ck, -dt, -ff, -ll, -mm, -nn, -rr, -tt, -tz}}''). Thus ''{{lang|de|Fass}}'' {{IPA|[fas]}} – ''{{lang|de|Fässer}}'' {{IPA|[ˈfɛsɐ]}}, by analogy to ''{{lang|de|Ball}}'' {{IPA|[bal]}} – ''{{lang|de|Bälle}}'' {{IPA|[ˈbɛlə]}}; compare the old spelling: ''{{lang|de|Faß}}'' – ''{{lang|de|Fässer}}'', in contrast to ''{{lang|de|Maß}}'' {{IPA|[maːs]}} – ''{{lang|de|Maße}}'' {{IPA|[ˈmaːsə]}} like ''{{lang|de|Tal}}'' {{IPA|[taːl]}} – ''{{lang|de|Täler}}'' {{IPA|[ˈtɛːlɐ]}}.

Nevertheless, the new German spelling is not fully phonetic, and it is still necessary to know the plural of a noun in order to spell its singular correctly: ''{{lang|de|Los}}'' {{IPA|[loːs]}} – ''{{lang|de|Lose}}'' {{IPA|[ˈloːzə]}}, ''{{lang|de|Floß}}'' {{IPA|[floːs]}} – ''{{lang|de|Flöße}}'' {{IPA|[ˈfløːsə]}} (note that it is however phonemic; cf. the usage of voiced versus voiceless plosives at word end).{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Exempted from change are certain very common short-vowelled words which end in a single 's' (such as ''{{lang|de|das, es}}''), echoing other undoubled final consonants in German (e.g. ''{{lang|de|ab, im, an, hat, -ig}}''). So the frequent error of confusing the conjunction ''{{lang|de|dass}}'' (previously ''{{lang|de|daß}}'') and the relative pronoun ''{{lang|de|das}}'' has remained a trap: ''{{lang|de|Ich hoffe, dass sie kommt.}}'' (I hope that she comes.) ''{{lang|de|Das Haus, das dort steht.}}'' (The house that stands there.) Both are pronounced {{ipa|/das/}}.

The so-called "s rule" makes up over 90% of the words changed by the reform. Since a trailing ''{{lang|de|-ss}}'' does not occur in the traditional orthography (which uses ''{{lang|de|-ß}}'' instead), the ''{{lang|de|-ss}}'' at the end of reformed words like ''{{lang|de|dass}}'' and ''{{lang|de|muss}}'' (previously ''{{lang|de|muß}}'') is now the only quick and sure sign to indicate that the reformed spelling has been used, even if just partly, in texts (except those of Swiss origin). All other changes are encountered less frequently and not in every text.

'''Triple consonants''' preceding a vowel are no longer reduced (but hyphenation is often used in these instances anyway):
* ''{{lang|de|Schiffahrt}}'' became ''{{lang|de|Schifffahrt}}'' from ''{{lang|de|Schiff}}'' (ship) + ''{{lang|de|Fahrt}}'' (journey)
In particular, triple "s" now appears more often than all the other triple consonants together, while in the traditional orthography they never appear.
* ''{{lang|de|Flußschiffahrt}}'' → ''{{lang|de|Flussschifffahrt}}'', ''{{lang|de|Mißstand}}'' → ''{{lang|de|Missstand}}''

'''Doubled consonants''' appear after short vowels at the end of certain words, to conform with derived forms:
* ''{{lang|de|As}}'' → ''{{lang|de|Ass}}'' because of plural ''{{lang|de|Asse}}'' (ace, aces)
* ''{{lang|de|Stop}}'' → ''{{lang|de|Stopp}}'' because of the verb ''{{lang|de|stoppen}}''

'''Vowel changes''', especially ''{{lang|de|ä}}'' for ''{{lang|de|e}}'', are made to conform with derived forms or related words.
* ''{{lang|de|Stengel}}'' → ''{{lang|de|Stängel}}'' (stalk) because of ''{{lang|de|Stange}}'' (bar)

Additional minor changes aim to remove a number of '''special cases''' or to allow alternative spellings
* ''{{lang|de|rauh}}'' → ''{{lang|de|rau}}'' (rough) for consistency with ''{{lang|de|blau}}'', ''{{lang|de|grau}}'', ''{{lang|de|genau}}''

Several '''loan words''' now allow spellings that are closer to the "German norm". In particular, the affixes ''{{lang|de|-phon}}'', ''{{lang|de|-phot}}'', and ''{{lang|de|-graph}}'' can be spelled with ''{{lang|de|f}}'' or ''{{lang|de|ph}}''.

===Capitalisation===
Capitalisation after a colon is now obligatory only if a full sentence or direct speech follows; otherwise a lower case letter must go after a colon.

The polite capitalisation of the ''formal'' second-person pronouns (''{{lang|de|Sie}}'', ''{{lang|de|Ihnen}}'', and ''{{lang|de|Ihr}}'') was retained. The original 1996 reform also  provided that the ''familiar'' second-person pronouns (''{{lang|de|du}}'', ''{{lang|de|dich}}'', ''{{lang|de|dir}}'', ''{{lang|de|dein}}'', ''{{lang|de|ihr}}'', ''{{lang|de|euch}}'', and ''{{lang|de|euer}}'') should not be capitalised, even in letters, but this was amended in the 2006 revision to permit their optional capitalisation in letters.

The reform aimed to make the capitalisation of nouns uniform and clarify the criteria for this. In the original 1996 reform, this included the capitalisation of some nouns in compound verbs where the nouns had largely lost that property, for instance changing ''{{lang|de|eislaufen}}'' to ''{{lang|de|Eis laufen}}'' (to ice-skate) and ''{{lang|de|kopfstehen}}'' to ''{{lang|de|Kopf stehen}}'' (to stand on one's head). However this was reversed in the 2006 revision, restoring verbs like ''{{lang|de|eislaufen}}'' and ''kopfstehen''.

===Compound words===
As before, [[compound noun]]s are generally joined into one word, but several other compounds are now separated.

Nouns and verbs are generally separated (but see above):
* ''{{lang|de|radfahren}}'' → ''{{lang|de|Rad fahren}}'' (to ride a [[bicycle]])

Multiple infinitive verbs used with [[finite verb]]s are separated:
* ''{{lang|de|kennenlernen}}'' → ''{{lang|de|kennen lernen}}'' (to get to know)
* ''{{lang|de|spazierengehen}}'' → ''{{lang|de|spazieren gehen}}'' (to go for a walk)

Other constructions now admit alternative forms:
* ''{{lang|de|an Stelle von}}'' or ''{{lang|de|anstelle von}}'' (instead of)

There are some subtle changes in the meaning when the new forms collide with some pre-existing forms:
* ''{{lang|de|vielversprechend}}'' → ''{{lang|de|viel versprechend}}'' (literally "much promising," but the meaning of the long compound adjective is "promising" in the sense of "up-and-coming", "auspicious"; whereas the second phrase with two words means "promising many things")

==Exceptions ==
* Family names: are completely excluded from the rules and are not affected by the reform; this also applies to given names.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |accessdate=8 January 2015 |language=German |url=http://www.duden.de/sprachwissen/rechtschreibregeln/namen |title=Rechtschreiberegeln: Namen |trans-title=Spelling rules: Names |publisher=Bibliographisches Institut GmbH; Dudenverlag }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Place names: are not strictly subject to the rules. The German ''{{lang|de|Ständiger Ausschuss für geographische Namen}}'' (Permanent Committee for Geographic Names) strongly recommends applying the rules for ''new'' names, but stresses that this applies only when new names are assigned or the competent authorities decide to modify existing names.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |accessdate=8 January 2015 |language=German |url=http://www.stagn.de/drupal/sites/default/files/pdf/070307_NdtRechtschreibung.pdf |title=Anwendung der Neuregelung der deutschen Rechtschreibung auf Geographische Namen |trans-title=Application of the German orthography reform to geographic names |publisher=Ständiger Ausschuss für geographische Namen |quote={{lang|de|'''SCHLUSSBEMERKUNG Grundsätzlich bleibt den zuständigen Stellen das Recht vorbehalten, selbst über die Schreibung geographischer Namen zu entscheiden.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Debate over the need for reform===
Spelling reform had been discussed for a long time and was still controversial in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="LearnGerman"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Learn German Online |title=The German spelling reform |url=http://www.learn-german-online.net/learning-german-resouces/german-spelling-reform.htm |accessdate=27 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutionalised reform talks since 1980===
In 1980, the ''{{lang|de|Internationaler Arbeitskreis für Orthographie}}'' (International Working Group for Orthography) was formed, with linguists from [[East Germany]], [[West Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]] taking part.

The initial proposals of this working group were further discussed at two [[academic conference|conferences]] in [[Vienna, Austria]], in 1986 and 1990, to which the Austrian government had invited representatives from every region where German is spoken. In the closing remarks from the first of these meetings, capitalisation reform was put off to a future "second phase" of [[German language]] reform attempts, since no consensus had been reached.

In 1987, the ministers of education of the federal states (''{{lang|de|[[States of Germany|Bundesländer]]}}'') in [[West Germany]] assigned the Institute for the German Language in [[Mannheim, Germany]] and the Society for the German Language in [[Wiesbaden, Germany]] with the task of coming up with a new system of rules. In 1988, these two organisations presented an incomplete but very wide-ranging set of proposed new rules, for example, the phrase ''{{lang|de|Der Kaiser {{linktext|ißt}} den Aal im Boot}}'' ("The Emperor eats the eel in the boat") would be written ''{{lang|de&lt;!-- -1987 (unsupported variant)--&gt;|Der keiser isst den al im bot}}''. However, these proposals were quickly rejected by the general public, and then they were withdrawn by the ministers of education as unacceptable. At the same time, similar groups were formed in Switzerland, Austria, and East Germany.

In 1992, the International Working Group published a proposed global reform to German spelling entitled ''{{lang|de|Deutsche Rechtschreibung — Vorschläge zu ihrer Neuregelung}}'' (''German Spelling: Proposals for its New Regulation''). In 1993, the German ministers of education invited 43 groups to present their opinions on the document, with hearings held in the unified Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. On the basis of these hearings, the working group backed off from the notion of eliminating the capitalisation of all nouns. It also preserved the orthographical distinction between the inconvenient homophones ''{{lang|de|das}}'' ("the", or "that", [[relative pronoun]]) and ''{{lang|de|daß}}'' ("that", [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]], as in "She said that you came"), which introduce different types of [[subordinate clause]].

At a third conference in [[Vienna]] in 1994, the results were recommended to the respective governments for acceptance. The German ministers of education decided to implement the new rules on 1 August 1998, with a transitional period lasting until the 2004–2005 school year.

===Institution of the reform===
On 1 July 1996, all of the German states (''{{lang|de|Bundesländer}}''), and the countries of [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Liechtenstein]], as well as some other countries with German-speaking minorities (but notably not [[Luxembourg]]) agreed to introduce the new spelling by 1 August 1998. A few German ''{{lang|de|Bundesländer}}'' introduced the new rules starting from the 1996–97 school year.

===Public debate after the signing of the declaration of intent===
The reforms did not attract much attention from the general public until after the international declaration of intent was signed. Animated arguments arose about the correctness of the decision, with schoolteachers being the first to be faced with the implementation of the new rules. At the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] (the largest in Germany) in 1996, {{ill|Friedrich Denk|de}}, a teacher from [[Bavaria]], obtained signatures from hundreds of authors and scientists demanding the cancellation of the reform. Among the leading opponents were {{lang|de|[[Günter Grass]]}}, {{lang|de|[[Siegfried Lenz]]}}, {{lang|de|[[Martin Walser]]}}, {{lang|de|[[Hans Magnus Enzensberger]]}}, and {{lang|de|[[Walter Kempowski]]}}. The protest gained further nationwide significance through initiatives such as ''{{lang|de|Wir Lehrer gegen die Rechtschreibreform}}'' (We Teachers Against the Spelling Reform),&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|[[:de:Initiative Wir Lehrer gegen die Rechtschreibreform|Initiative „Wir Lehrer gegen die Rechtschreibreform“]]}} ("Teachers Against the Spelling Reform")&lt;/ref&gt; which was headed by the teacher and activist {{lang|de|[[Manfred Riebe]]}}.

In May 1997, the "Society for German Spelling and Language Cultivation – initiative against the spelling reform"&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|[[:de:Verein für deutsche Rechtschreibung und Sprachpflege|Verein für deutsche Rechtschreibung und Sprachpflege e.V. (VRS) – Initiative gegen die Rechtschreibreform]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang|de|Verein für deutsche Rechtschreibung und Sprachpflege e. V. (VRS) – Initiative gegen die Rechtschreibreform}}'') was founded in opposition to the German spelling reform.

The issue was taken up in the courts, with different decisions in different German states, so that the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] (''{{lang|de|Bundesverfassungsgericht}}'') was called upon to make a ruling. In May 1998 a group of 550 language and literature professors, led by {{ill|Theodor Ickler|de}}, {{lang|de|Helmut Jochems}}, {{ill|Horst Haider Munske|de}} and Peter Eisenberg, two of the Reformers, {{lang|de|[[Harald Weinrich]]}} of the {{lang|fr|[[Collège de France]]}}, {{lang|fr|[[Jean-Marie Zemb]]}} of the {{lang|fr|[[Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques]]}}, and others, in a resolution requested the reversal of the reform by the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tu-berlin.de/fb1/AGiW/Cricetus/SOzuC1/SOVsRSR/ArchivSO/LitWErkl.pdf Gemeinsame Erklärung von rund 600 Sprachprofessoren zur Rechtschreibreform, Mai 1998] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607070343/http://www.tu-berlin.de/fb1/AGiW/Cricetus/SOzuC1/SOVsRSR/ArchivSO/LitWErkl.pdf |date=2007-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 July 1998, after one hearing on 12 May 1998, and involving only one teachers' organisation, the High Court declared that the introduction of the spelling reform by the ministers of education was legal.{{Primary source-inline|date=January 2012}}

In the German state of {{lang|de|[[Schleswig-Holstein]]}}, a majority of voters in a referendum on 27 September 1998 called for a return to traditional spellings. However, the minister-president of the state, {{lang|de|[[Heide Simonis]]}}, found a way to reverse the results of the referendum via a parliamentary vote in 1999.

While the new German dictionaries were published in July and August 1996, the critics of the language reform perceived themselves to be justified. They began to demand the reversal of the change at the federal level. However, the ministers of education continued to refuse to accede to their demands. The editors of the [[Duden]] dictionaries also agreed that many of the problems in the traditional spelling system were due to the "arcane rules" that had been fabricated to explain the system, thus lending their support to the new spelling system, which they said was and is more logical.

One of the public critics of the spelling reform was {{illm|Josef Kraus|de|Josef Kraus (Lehrer)}} , president of the ''{{lang|de|Deutscher Lehrerverband}}'' (the German Association of Teachers).

===Later developments===
In 1997, an international committee was formed to handle any cases of doubt that might arise under the new rules. In 2004, the German [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|federal minister of education and research]], {{lang|de|Edelgard Bulmahn}}, announced that this committee was to be given wide-ranging powers to make decisions about German spelling. Only in cases of extreme changes, such as the proposed capitalisation change, would the committee require the consent of the states' ministers of education. This move was strongly criticised.

Simultaneously, the committee released its fourth report on spelling reforms, reviewing the points of the reform in detail. However, this report was rejected by the [[Kultusministerkonferenz|Conference of Ministers of Education]] in March 2004. The ministers also demanded that the committee work together with the [[German Academy for Language and Poetry]] in its future deliberations. The academy had been strongly critical of the reform from the beginning. The ministers also made changes to the composition of the international committee.{{cn|date=August 2018}} 

In July 2004, the ministers decided to introduce some changes to the reform, making both the traditional and the new spellings acceptable. They also formed a [[Council for German Orthography]], "38 experts from five countries", representing linguists, publishers, writers, journalists, teachers and parents. Taking the place of the existing international committee, the Council agreed unanimously to implement the uncontroversial parts of the reform, while allowing compromises on other changes: "writing compounds separately or as a single word, [on] the use of lower and upper case, punctuation and syllabification".&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|Dagmar Giersberg}}, [http://www.goethe.de/ges/spa/siw/en630493.htm Chronicle Of A Long Debate: The Spelling Reform (December 2007)] Retrieved 29 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This modified reform came into effect by 1 August 2006.

==Legal status==
The spelling change is based on the international agreement of 1 July 1996, signed on behalf of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The signatories for Germany were the president of the [[Kultusministerkonferenz|Conference of Ministers of Education]], {{lang|de|[[Karl-Heinz Reck]]}}, and the parliamentary secretary of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, {{lang|de|Eduard Lintner}}. There have been no {{lang|de|[[Bundestag]]}} (parliamentary) decisions on the reforms. Instead, as mentioned above, the [[German Supreme Court]] ruled that the reform in the public schools could be decided by the ministers of education. Thus, as of 1 August 2005, the traditional spelling system was to be considered incorrect in the schools, except that two of the German states, [[Bavaria]] and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], had both officially rejected the reform. Since 2006, the new rules have become compulsory in Bavarian and North Rhine-Westphalian public schools as well. It is presumed that from the schools the writing reforms will spread to the German-speaking public.

==State of implementation==
{{As of|2004}}, most German printed media used spelling rules that to a large extent comply with the reforms. These included most newspapers and periodicals, and the German press agencies {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Presse Agentur]]}} (DPA) and [[Reuters]]. Still, some newspapers, including ''{{lang|de|[[Die Zeit]]}}'', the ''{{lang|de|[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]}}'', the ''{{lang|de|[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]}}'', and the ''{{lang|de|[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]}}'', created their own in-house orthography rules, while most other newspapers used approximately the rules set out by the DPA. These in-house orthographies thus occupy a continuum between "old spelling with new rules for [[ß]]" and an (almost) full acceptance of the new rules.

Schoolbooks and children's books generally follow the new spellings, while the text of novels is presented as the authors prefer. Classic works of literature are typically printed without any changes, unless they are editions specifically intended for use in schools.{{cn|date=August 2018}} 

Since dictionaries adopted the new spellings early on, there is no currently in-print, standard reference work available for traditional spellings. However, {{ill|Theodor Ickler|de}}, a Professor of German at the [[University of Erlangen]], has produced a new dictionary that aims to meet the demands of simplification without the need to impose any new spellings.{{Clarify|date=September 2008}} It has not been reprinted since 2004. The commerce in used copies of the older [[Duden|Duden dictionaries]] has dwindled. As of the 2004 edition, the Duden dictionary includes the most recent changes proposed by the ministers of education.{{cn|date=August 2018}} 

==Acceptance of the reform==

===In Switzerland and Liechtenstein===
In [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]], the reform had a less noticeable impact, as the letter "[[ß]]", which was a prominent part of the reform, had [[ß#Switzerland_and_Liechtenstein|not been in much use]] anyway.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

The study of intercultural relations incorporates many different academic disciplines.  As a field, it is most closely tied to [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]], although a degree program in Intercultural Relations or Intercultural Studies may also include the study of [[history]], [[research]] methods, [[urban studies]], [[gender studies]], [[public health]], many various [[natural sciences]], [[human development (biology)|human development]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[religion]], [[missiology]], and [[linguistics]] or other language training.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Judith.

McGraw Hill. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, Intercultural programs are designed to translate these academic disciplines into a practical training curricula.  [[Graduate school|Graduate]] programs will also prepare students for academic research and publication.&lt;ref&gt;learn.org, "What is Intercultural Studies?". http://learn.org/articles/What_is_Intercultural_Studies.html. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in today's global and multicultural world, yes, students of Intercultural Relations can use their training in many fields both internationally and domestically, and often pursue careers in [[social work]], [[law]], [[community development]], religious work, and [[urban development]].&lt;ref&gt;The College Board.

==History==
The origins of the practical use of multi-field Intercultural Relations can be traced back to Christian missionaries seeking to relate the Christian gospel to other cultures in effective, ethical and culturally sensitive ways.&lt;ref&gt;Pierson, Paul.&gt;"The Dynamics of Christian Mission: History Through a Missiogical Perspective." William Carey International University Press. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Paul.  Murphy, Liam.  "A History of Anthropological Theory." Third Edition.  University of Toronto Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;   Many Intercultural Studies programs are offered at religious institutions as training for [[missionaries]] and religiously motivated international development workers, and therefore often include some training in [[theology]] and [[evangelism]].&lt;ref&gt;Wheaton College. "Intercultural Studies and Missions&gt;. http://www.wheaton.edu/Academics/Departments/INTR/INTR-Missions. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in an increasingly [[globalized]] world, the broader discipline attracts persons from many backgrounds with many different career goals.&lt;ref&gt;Teather, D. (2004). The networking alliance: A mechanism for the internationalisation of higher education? Managing Education Matters, 7(2), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both bachelor's and master's degrees are offered in the discipline.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16877">Each style and era of [[jazz]] adopted new techniques to help educate younger musicians.  Early forms of '''jazz education''' were more informal.  Since the first degree program was founded in 1947, the rise of institutionalized jazz education, resulted in jazz education becoming more formalized and more structured.&lt;ref name="Worthy"&gt;Worthy&lt;/ref&gt; Formalized jazz education has brought a new wave of interest in jazz.  [http://JazzTimes.com JazzTimes.com] currently lists 492 collegiate jazz programs globally.  This database is exclusive to just schools that offer majors and does not include the number of schools that also offer jazz courses in their curriculum.&lt;ref name="JazzEducation"&gt;"Jazz Education"&lt;/ref&gt;  The formalization of jazz was and still is a controversial subject.  Many professional musicians believe that it has harmed the spirit of the music, while others maintain that it has been beneficial for the art form.&lt;ref name="Ake"&gt;Ake, 104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early jazz education==
{{Main article|Timeline of jazz education}}
[[Jazz]] has long been celebrated for its roots as an aural tradition.  This defined early jazz education in [[New Orleans]], where the music originated among musicians who largely could not read music.&lt;ref&gt;Kirchner, 87&lt;/ref&gt;  Early musically literate musicians who were able to afford formal music lessons, such as [[Jelly Roll Morton]], scorned formal education and were left with varying degrees of musical literacy.&lt;ref&gt;Kirchner, 89&lt;/ref&gt;  In New Orleans at the turn of the 20th century, as jazz was taking form from its roots, musicians learned in a style that is best described as an apprenticeship.  Younger musicians would study with an older and more experienced musician, learning by listening to the music their mentor played.&lt;ref&gt;Dapogny&lt;/ref&gt;
This relationship also extended to a personal level.  Many of these younger musicians would run errands for their mentors in order to repay them for the musical lessons.  An early example of this style of education is [[Louis Armstrong]], who studied under famed trumpet player [[King Oliver]].&lt;ref name="Gioia"&gt;Gioia,48&lt;/ref&gt; This educational form was dependent on [[aural skills]].  This style of pedagogy was prevalent in an era where the music relied heavily on group improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;Gridley, 46&lt;/ref&gt;  The use, almost exclusively, of ear training amongst pedagogues and the cultural influence of New Orleans made this style of jazz the most practical and popular.

In the late 1910s and early 1920s, jazz begins to move north to [[Chicago]]&lt;ref name="Gioia" /&gt; and [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Gioia, 52&lt;/ref&gt;  These two urban areas were particularly popular because they provided a larger audience base for performers and closer proximity to recording studios.&lt;ref&gt;Gioia, 70&lt;/ref&gt;  During the early part of the 1920s, [[Chicago-style dixieland|New Orleans Jazz]] was prevalent in the many nightclubs sprung up in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Gioia, 72&lt;/ref&gt;  In New York a new style of jazz became immensely popular.  This style, known as [[Big Band]], ushered in a new era of jazz education.&lt;ref&gt;Gioia, 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Big band music is particularly important for jazz education because it introduces a number of new forums for the furthering of jazz music.  The first such forum is the [[arranger]].  With the emergence of big bands arose a need for more detailed and thorough [[arrangement]]s.  Arrangers helped to standardize big band vocabulary. With the arranger, jazz began to mature from its roots as an exclusively aural art form.   The arranger helped to introduce new influences, especially [[Impressionist Music]] during the big band era.&lt;ref name="Shipton"&gt;Shipton, 217&lt;/ref&gt;

The next influential introduction of the big band era was the emergence of after hours [[jam sessions]].&lt;ref name="Shipton" /&gt;  Many ideas for arrangements developed from after hours jam sessions.  Many of these ideas would eventually turn into arrangements of their own.  [[Duke Ellington]] used this technique to create new tunes and arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Ellington&lt;/ref&gt;

These jam sessions were also a pivotal forum for the development of [[jazz improvisation]].  Jam sessions were home to the exploration of and self-education in improvisation.  Musicians used these sessions as a way to learn from fellow musicians to improve their own skills. Clubs like [[Clark|Monroe’s Uptown House]] and [[Minton’s Playhouse]] became the public home for the phenomena that already took place in apartments and smaller venues across Manhattan and the rest of the country.  The style that most directly descended from these jam sessions is known as [[bebop]].  Early bebop musicians such as [[Charlie Parker]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Thelonious Monk]] introduced a new and more virtuosic style of improvising that proved influential to future generations of jazz musicians&lt;ref&gt;Gioia, 201&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early university jazz programs==

Jazz bands in secondary schools and colleges typically emerged as extracurricular auxiliary ensembles, derived from larger concert or marching bands. The earliest college jazz bands were not offered for academic credit and were usually organized and led by students. (Oxford Music Online)&lt;ref name="Worthy" /&gt;

Prior to the first jazz degree, some academic classes were offered.  In 1941 the [[New School for Social Research]] in [[Manhattan]] offered a jazz history course.  In 1945 a school known as the Schillenger House opened in [[Boston]].  This school "offered a two year curriculum and awarded an artist diploma."&lt;ref name="Worthy" /&gt;  In 1973, the Schillenger House, which became the Berklee School of Music in 1954, officially changed its name to [[Berklee College of Music]].  The first college degree in jazz was offered in 1947 at the [[University of North Texas College of Music|University of North Texas]].&lt;ref name="Worthy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott, 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the course of the next few decades, jazz programs popped up all over the country and around the world.&lt;ref name="Worthy" /&gt;  This [[Timeline of jazz education]], notes the starting dates of many of these influential programs.

By 1950, there were over 30 colleges and universities offering jazz courses.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with this growth at universities came a number of summer programs that served to educate young musicians about jazz.  [[Stan Kenton]] is particularly famous for starting one such summer program.  These summer camps were some of the first academic institution of any type to invite professional musicians to help educate young students.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald&lt;/ref&gt;  This precedent continued to become more prominent.&lt;ref&gt;"Jazz Education."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creating a jazz curriculum==

One of the most difficult, controversial and necessary steps in molding jazz into an academic program was standardization and formalization of jazz music.  Prior to the introduction of the first jazz academic programs, musicians attempted to produce literature that explained jazz in a formal manner.&lt;ref name="Worthy" /&gt; 
Norbert Beihoff ''(né'' Norbert John Beihoff; 1904–2003) first attempted to explain jazz improvisation and arranging in a 1935 publication entitled ''Modern Arranging and Orchestration'' ({{OCLC|191822905}}). Professional musicians wrote method books, some with accompanying play-along records. ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine published transcribed solos and pedagogical articles. In 1941 [[Joseph Schillinger]] published The Schillinger System of Musical Composition, a widely used text based on his own system of jazz arranging. [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]] wrote a text entitled ''[[Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization]]'' in 1953, promoting the idea that jazz chords have corresponding scales that may be used for improvisation".&lt;ref name="Worthy" /&gt;
These books did not have a universal impact and were quickly forgotten.  As the discipline expanded it became increasingly necessary to create standardized material to support a jazz curriculum.  Early jazz educators such as [[Jamey Aebersold]], [[David Baker (composer)|David Baker]] and Jerry Coker laid the groundwork for a more universal educational practice.  The first round of textbooks and other resources was characterized by an emphasis on strict formalization and structure, on the definition of levels, and on establishing a relatively narrow core early Aebersold books.  In this clarification process, harmonic structures also became codified, and progressions  such as the twelve-bar blues and the [[ii–V–I progression|ii-V-I]] were defined as the easiest and most common, as indeed they were at the time."&lt;ref name="Beale"&gt;Beale, 759&lt;/ref&gt;

"The need to justify jazz education as worthy of institutional and cultural attention led to a clear, if in retrospect slightly limited, definition of a single jazz style and related set of skills."&lt;ref name="Beale" /&gt;  The style that came to the fore for early jazz educators was bebop.  Bebop improvisation is based on these fairly standard patterns and usually performed at tempos that force musicians to acquire a high level of facility with their instrument.  Bebop vocabulary quickly became an important part of early formalized jazz education.&lt;ref&gt;Gridley, 145&lt;/ref&gt;

Overlooked by this approach were the equally developed written techniques of jazz music.  By this point in time, jazz composition and arranging had in its own right reached virtuosic levels.  Written jazz, thanks in large part to the popularity of the swing era, established its own traditions within jazz music.  One of the first educators to incorporate this aspect of jazz into was [[Gene Hall]], a graduate of [[University of North Texas College of Music|University of North Texas]].&lt;ref name="Worthy" /&gt;  [[Gene Hall]], who had written a master's thesis there in which he outlined a proposed college-level jazz curriculum, became the first faculty member in the new program. Central to Hall's curriculum was an arranging class for which a laboratory ensemble performed student arrangements and compositions. That ensemble became the [[One O'Clock Lab Band]]." &lt;ref name="Worthy" /&gt;

==Educational ensembles==

The end of [[World War II]] signified the end of the big band era.  Even prior to this band leaders experienced difficulty financial supporting larger ensembles.  As early as 1930, bands were trimming down to smaller ensembles.  After the war, only a handful of the most prolific big bands survived.  Many of these bands continued to tour for a number of years, but big bands have never enjoyed the professional success they enjoyed during the [[Swing Era]].&lt;ref&gt;Shipton, 438&lt;/ref&gt;  College jazz programs revitalized the dying style.

By 1970 there were more than 450 college jazz bands and by 1980 there were over 500,000 high school and college students involved in jazz activities.&lt;ref name="JazzEducation" /&gt;  The influx of student musicians brought about by formalized jazz education suddenly provided academic institutions with the numbers necessary to create their own big bands.  Big bands also serve a very important pedagogical purpose.  These bands enable educators to access a greater number of students at the same time.

In 1967, as the number of college jazz bands was increasing at a rapid rate, a new ensemble was formed at [[Mount Hood Community College]].  This ensemble took big band repertoire and set it for choir.  Genesis became the first jazz choir.  The creation of the [[vocal jazz]] ensemble is indicative of the direction of jazz education.&lt;ref&gt;"Mt. Hood Genesis Vocal Jazz Ensemble | The Jazz Education Network"&lt;/ref&gt;  Educators searching for new ways to make the music accessible turned to fusing different styles.  The vocal jazz ensemble combines the classical traditions of [[classical music|Western Art Music]], the vocal and instrumental traditions of jazz, and the pedagogical influence of jazz education.

== Controversy in jazz education==

"The topic of jazz education has produced controversy since its beginnings.  Many scholars avoid the subject almost entirely in their publications on jazz.  
Ted Gioia’s The History of Jazz makes virtually no mention of music schools, nor does Ken Burns’s ten-part PBS documentary.  Gary Giddins’s 2004 collection Weather Bird consists of 146 short essays … Giddins never broaches the topic of jazz education."&lt;ref name="Ake" /&gt;
The standardization of the jazz repertoire by early educators, such as Jamey Aebersold, drew criticism for the narrow lens with which it approached jazz education.  Many feel that by taking the jazz and setting it to regimented structures and scales removes feeling from the music.&lt;ref&gt;Beale, 764&lt;/ref&gt;  
Some also argue that this new style of jazz education is too focused on the individual musician.  Classes and lessons have replaced jam sessions, which served as the major form of jazz education for the first half of the twentieth century.  Jam sessions forced musicians to learn from one another to develop technique and vocabulary.  Critics of formalized jazz education denounce the new emphasis put on learning music from sheet music instead of by ear.  Books such as the ''[[Charlie Parker Omnibook]]'', which is particularly popular publication, are denounced for the quality of student they produce.  
In response, jazz educators point to the revitalized interest in jazz music and the high quality of musicians now playing jazz music.  On top of this, standardization of jazz techniques is an event that occurred before the introduction of institutionalized jazz education.  Arrangers and instrumentalists alike developed techniques that became standard practice.&lt;ref&gt;Gridley, 190&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jazz education organizations==

Since the rise of jazz in academia, many institutions have sought to bring a unified face to jazz education.  One of the largest of these groups was known as the [[International Association for Jazz Education]], which scheduled regular conferences in cities across the world.  The IAJE, however declared bankruptcy in April 2008.  A new organization that has come to the fore is known as the Jazz Education Network, the website for which can be found at the [http://www.jazzednet.org Jazz Education Network Website].  JEN was founded by [[Orbert Davis]], Lou Fischer and Mary Jo Papich in 2008.  The organization holds an annual conference each year as well as sponsoring other festivals.

The '''Julius Nyerere University of Agriculture (JNUA)''' is a proposed public university that will be built in northern [[Tanzania]]. It will be located in [[Butiama]], the hometown of [[Julius Nyerere]].This will be the country's second university dedicated to agricultural research after the [[Sokoine University of Agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |date=13 April 2014 |title=Second agriculture university to honour Sokoine underway |url=http://archive.dailynews.co.tz/index.php/local-news/30297-second-agriculture-university-to-honour-sokoine-underway |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141212162946/http://archive.dailynews.co.tz/index.php/local-news/30297-second-agriculture-university-to-honour-sokoine-underway |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 December 2014 |newspaper=Daily News |location= |accessdate=12 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In November 2014, the Deputy Education Minister [[Jenista Mhagama]] informed the [[National Assembly (Tanzania)|parliament]] that feasibility study is complete and her ministry has requested funding from the [[Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs (Tanzania)|Finance Ministry]]. Apart from the main campus in Butiama, an additional four will be built in [[Serengeti District|Serengeti]], [[Bunda District|Bunda]], [[Rorya District|Rorya]] and [[Musoma District|Musoma]] districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=13 November 2014 |title=Feasibility study on long-awaited Butiama University now complete |url=http://www.ippmedia.com/frontend/?l=74122 |newspaper=The Guardian |location= |accessdate=12 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 2014, President [[Jakaya Kikwete]] appointed Professor Dominic Kambarage as the inaugural Vice Chancellor of the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |date=12 December 2014 |title=Kambarage appointed Nyerere university VC |url=http://www.dailynews.co.tz/index.php/local-news/39284-kambarage-appointed-nyerere-university-vc |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141212181335/http://www.dailynews.co.tz/index.php/local-news/39284-kambarage-appointed-nyerere-university-vc |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 December 2014 |newspaper=Daily News |location= |accessdate=12 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Language pedagogy'''{{definition needed|date=March 2017}} may take place as a general school subject, in a specialized [[language school]], or out of school with a rich selection of [[Language pedagogy#Proprietary methods|proprietary methods]] online and in books, CDs and DVDs. There are many methods of teaching languages. Some have fallen into relative obscurity and others are widely used; still others have a small following, but offer useful insights.

There are '''three principal views''':
# The '''structural''' view treats language as a system of structurally related elements to code meaning (e.g. grammar).
# The '''functional''' view sees language as a vehicle to express or accomplish a certain function, such as requesting something.
# The '''interactive''' view sees language as a vehicle for the creation and maintenance of social relations, focusing on patterns of moves, acts, negotiation and interaction found in conversational exchanges. This view has been fairly dominant since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite book |title=Approaches and Methods in Language Teaching |last=Richards|first=Jack C. |authorlink= |author2=Theodore S. Rodgers |year=2001|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge UK |isbn=0-521-00843-3 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
In the late 1800s and most of the 1900s,&lt;ref name=Anthony1963 /&gt; language teaching was usually conceived in terms of ''method''. In seeking to improve teaching practices, teachers and researchers would typically try to find out which method was the most effective.{{sfn|Hall|2011|p=57}} However, ''method'' is an ambiguous concept in language teaching, and has been used in many different ways. According to Bell, this variety in use "offers a challenge for anyone wishing to enter into the analysis or deconstruction of methods".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|2003|p=326}}, cited in {{harvnb|Hall|2011|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Approach'', ''method'' and ''technique'' ==

In 1963, University of Michigan Linguistics Professor Edward Mason Anthony Jr. formulated a framework to describe various language teaching methods, which consisted of three levels: ''approach'', ''method'', and ''technique''.{{sfn|Richards|Rodgers|2001|p=19}} According to Anthony, "The arrangement is hierarchical. The organizational key is that techniques carry out a method which is consistent with an approach."&lt;ref name="Anthony1963"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anthony|1963|pp=63–67}}, cited in {{Harvnb|Richards|Rogers|2001|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His concept of ''approach'' was of a set of principles or ideas about the nature of language learning which would be consistent over time; "an approach is axiomatic".&lt;ref name="Anthony1963" /&gt; His ''method'' was more procedural; "an overall plan for the orderly presentation of language material, no part of which contradicts, and all of which is based upon, the selected approach."&lt;ref name="Anthony1963" /&gt; Finally, his concept of ''technique'' referred to the actual implementation in the language classroom; "a particular trick, stratagem, or contrivance used to accomplish an immediate objective."&lt;ref name="Anthony1963" /&gt; He saw techniques as being consistent with a given method and by extension, with a given approach.{{sfn|Richards|Rodgers|2001|p=19}}

A method is a plan for presenting the language material to be learned and should be based upon a selected approach.  In order for an approach to be translated into a method, an instructional system must be designed considering the objectives of the teaching/learning, how the content is to be selected and organized, the types of tasks to be performed, the roles of students and the roles of teachers. A technique is a very specific, concrete stratagem or trick designed to accomplish an immediate objective.  Such are derived from the controlling method, and less-directly, with the approach.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

Anthony's framework was welcomed by the language teaching community when it was introduced, and it was seen as a useful way of classifying different teaching practices.{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=85}} However, it did not clearly define the difference between ''approach'', ''method'', and ''technique'', and Kumaravadivelu reports that due to this ambiguity there was "widespread dissatisfaction" with it.{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=85}} Anthony himself recognized the limitations of his framework, and was open to the idea of improvements being made to it.{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=85}}

== ''Approach'', ''design'' and ''procedure'' ==

Richards and Rogers' 1982 approach expanded on Anthony's three-level framework; however, instead of ''approach'', ''method'' and ''technique'', they chose the terms ''approach'', ''design'', and ''procedure''.{{sfn|Johnson|Johnson|1999}} Their concept of ''approach'' was similar to Anthony's, but their ''design'' and ''procedure'' were of broader scope than Anthony's ''method'' and ''technique''.{{sfn|Johnson|Johnson|1999}} Their ''design'' referred to all major practical implications in the classroom, such as syllabus design, types of activities to be used in the classroom, and student and teacher roles; ''procedure'' referred to different behaviors, practices and techniques observed in the classroom.{{sfn|Johnson|Johnson|1999}} These new terms were intended to address limitations in Anthony's framework,{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=86}} and also gave them specific criteria by which they could evaluate different "methods".{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=88}} This evaluation process was a key way that their formulation differed from Anthony's, as Anthony's framework was intended as purely descriptive.{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=88}}

Despite Richards and Rogers' efforts to clearly define ''approach'', ''design'', and ''procedure'', their framework has been criticized by Kumaravadivelu for having "an element of artificiality in its conception and an element of subjectivity in its operation".{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=87}} Kumaravadivelu also points to similar objections raised by Pennyworth and by the ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Language Teaching and Learning''.{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=87}} Brown also questions the suitability of Richards and Rogers' term ''design''; he points out that in English teaching ''design'' is usually used to refer specifically to curriculum design, rather than the broad definition Richards and Rogers used.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2001}}, cited in {{harvnb|Hall|2011|p=77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most current teacher training manuals favor the terms ''approach'', ''method'', and ''technique''.{{sfn|Hall|2011|p=77}}

== Structural methods ==

=== Grammar–translation method ===
{{main article|Grammar–translation method}}
The grammar translation method instructs students in [[grammar]], and provides [[vocabulary]] with direct translations to [[memory|memorize]]. It was the predominant method in Europe in the 19th century. Most instructors now acknowledge that this method is ineffective by itself.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} It is now most commonly used in the traditional instruction of the [[classical languages]], however it remains the most commonly practiced method of English teaching in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

At school, the teaching of grammar consists of a process of training in the rules of a language which must make it possible for all the students to correctly express their opinion, to understand the remarks which are addressed to them and to analyze the texts which they read.
The objective is that by the time they leave college, the pupil controls the tools of the language which are the vocabulary, grammar and the [[orthography]], to be able to read, understand and write texts in various contexts. The teaching of grammar examines texts, and develops awareness that language constitutes a system which can be analyzed.
This knowledge is acquired gradually, by traversing the facts of language and the syntactic mechanisms, going from simplest to the most complex. The exercises according to the program of the course must untiringly be practiced to allow the assimilation of the rules stated in the course.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} That supposes that the teacher corrects the exercises. The pupil can follow his progress in practicing the language by comparing his results.
Thus can he adapt the grammatical rules and control little by little the internal logic of the syntactic system. The grammatical analysis of [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s constitutes the objective of the teaching of grammar at the school. Its practice makes it possible to recognize a [[text (literary theory)|text]] as a coherent whole and conditions the training of a foreign language.
Grammatical terminology serves this objective.  Grammar makes it possible for each pupil to understand how his mother tongue functions, in order to give him the capacity to communicate his thought.

=== Audio-lingual method ===
{{Main article|Audio-lingual method}}
The audio-lingual method was developed in the United States around [[World War II]] when governments realized that they needed more people who could conduct conversations fluently in a variety of languages, work as interpreters, code-room assistants, and translators. However, since foreign language instruction in that country was heavily focused on reading instruction, no textbooks, other materials or courses existed at the time, so new methods and materials had to be devised. For example, the U.S. Army Specialized Training Program created intensive programs based on the techniques [[Leonard Bloomfield]] and other linguists devised for Native American languages, where students interacted intensively with native speakers and a linguist in guided conversations designed to decode its basic grammar and learn the vocabulary. This "[[Informant (linguistics)|informant method]]" had great success with its small class sizes and motivated learners.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

The U.S. Army Specialized Training Program only lasted a few years, but it gained a lot of attention from the popular press and the academic community.  [[Charles C. Fries]] set up the first English Language Institute at the [[University of Michigan]], to train English as a second or foreign language teachers.  Similar programs were created later at [[Georgetown University]], [[University of Texas]] among others based on the methods and techniques used by the military.  The developing method had much in common with the British oral approach although the two developed independently. The main difference was the developing audio-lingual methods allegiance to structural linguistics, focusing on grammar and contrastive analysis to find differences between the student's native language and the target language in order to prepare specific materials to address potential problems. These materials strongly emphasized drill as a way to avoid or eliminate these problems.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

This first version of the method was originally called the oral method, the aural-oral method or the structural approach. The audio-lingual method truly began to take shape near the end of the 1950s, this time due government pressure resulting from the [[space race]].  Courses and techniques were redesigned to add insights from [[behaviorist psychology]] to the structural linguistics and constructive analysis already being used. Under this method, students listen to or view recordings of language models acting in situations. Students practice with a variety of drills, and the instructor emphasizes the use of the [[Second language|target language]] at all times. The idea is that by reinforcing 'correct' behaviors, students will make them into habits.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

The typical structure of a chapter employing the Audio-Lingual-Method (ALM—and there was even a text book entitled '''ALM''' [1963]) was usually standardized as follows: 1. First item was a dialog in the foreign language (FL) to be memorized by the student. The teacher would go over it the day before. 2. There were then questions in the FL about the dialog to be answered by the student(s) in the target language. 3. Often a brief introduction to the grammar of the chapter was next, including the verb(s) and conjugations. 4. The mainstay of the chapter was "pattern practice," which were drills expecting "automatic" responses from the student(s) as a noun, verb conjugation, or agreeing adjective was to be inserted in the blank in the text (or during the teacher's pause). The teacher could have the student use the book or not use it, relative to how homework was assigned. Depending on time, the class could respond as a chorus, or the teacher could pick individuals to respond. Julian Dakin, in 'The Language Laboratory and Language Learning' (Longman 1973), coined the phrase 'meaningless drills' to describe this kind of pattern practice, which others have also described as "mimicry-memorization." 5. There was a vocabulary list, sometimes with translations to the mother tongue.  6. The chapter usually ended with a short reading exercise.

Due to weaknesses in performance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://webh01.ua.ac.be/didascalia/mortality.htm Universiteit Antwerpen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112010049/http://webh01.ua.ac.be/didascalia/mortality.htm |date=2009-01-12 }} James L. Barker lecture on November 8, 2001 at [[Brigham Young University]], given by Wilfried Decoo.&lt;/ref&gt; and more importantly because of [[Noam Chomsky]]'s theoretical attack on language learning as a set of habits, audio-lingual methods are rarely the primary method of instruction today. However, elements of the method still survive in many textbooks.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

== Functional methods ==

=== The oral approach and situational language teaching ===
The oral approach was developed from the 1930s to the 1960s by British applied linguists such as Harold Palmer and A.S. Hornsby.  They were familiar with the direct method as well as the work of 19th-century applied linguists such as Otto Jespersen and Daniel Jones but attempted to formally develop a more scientifically founded approach to teaching English than was evidenced by the direct method.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

A number of large-scale investigations about language learning and the increased emphasis on reading skills in the 1920s led to the notion of "vocabulary control". It was discovered that languages have a core basic vocabulary of about 2,000 words that occur frequently in written texts, and it was assumed that mastery of these would greatly aid reading comprehension. Parallel to this was the notion of "grammar control", emphasizing the sentence patterns most-commonly found in spoken conversation. Such patterns were incorporated into dictionaries and handbooks for students. The principal difference between the oral approach and the direct method was that methods devised under this approach would have theoretical principles guiding the selection of content, gradation of difficulty of exercises and the presentation of such material and exercises. The main proposed benefit was that such theoretically based organization of content would result in a less-confusing sequence of learning events with better contextualization of the vocabulary and grammatical patterns presented.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt; Last but not least, all language points were to be presented in "situations".  Emphasis on this point led to the approach's second name. Proponents claim that this approach leads to students' acquiring good habits to be repeated in their corresponding situations. These teaching methods stress PPP:  presentation (introduction of new material in context), practice (a controlled practice phase) and production (activities designed for less-controlled practice).&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

Although this approach is all but unknown among language teachers today, elements of it have had long-lasting effects on language teaching, being the basis of many widely used English as a Second/Foreign Language textbooks as late as the 1980s and elements of it still appear in current texts.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt; Many of the structural elements of this approach were called into question in the 1960s, causing modifications of this method that led to communicative language teaching. However, its emphasis on oral practice, grammar and sentence patterns still finds widespread support among language teachers and remains popular in countries where foreign language syllabuses are still heavily based on grammar.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

=== Directed practice ===
Directed practice has students repeat phrases. This method is used by U.S. diplomatic courses. It can quickly provide a phrasebook-type knowledge of the language. Within these limits, the student's usage is accurate and precise. However the student's choice of what to say is not flexible.

== Interactive methods ==

[[File:Spanish class.jpg|thumb|right|[[High school (North America)|High School]] Spanish taught as a [[second language]] to a class of native [[English speakers]] at an American [[private school]] in [[Massachusetts]].]]

=== Direct method ===
{{Main article|Direct method (education)}}
The direct method, sometimes also called ''natural method'', is a method that refrains from using the learners' native language and just uses the target language. It was established in Germany and France around 1900 and is best represented by the methods devised by Berlitz and de Sauzé, although neither claims originality and it has been re-invented under other names.&lt;ref name="Diller"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Language Teaching Controversy |last=Diller |first=Karl Conrad |authorlink= |year=1978 |publisher=Newbury House |location=Rowley, Massachusetts |isbn=0883771144 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The direct method operates on the idea that second language learning must be an imitation of [[first language]] learning, as this is the natural way humans learn any language: a child never relies on another language to learn its first language, and thus the mother tongue is not necessary to learn a foreign language. This method places great stress on correct pronunciation and the target language from outset. It advocates teaching of oral skills at the expense of every traditional aim of language teaching. Such methods rely on directly representing an experience into a linguistic construct rather than relying on abstractions like mimicry, translation and memorizing grammar rules and vocabulary.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;

According to this method, printed language and text must be kept away from second language learners for as long as possible, just as a first language learner does not use printed words until he has good grasp of speech. Learning of writing and spelling should be delayed until after the printed word has been introduced, and grammar and translation should also be avoided because this would involve the application of the learner's first language. All above items must be avoided because they hinder the acquisition of a good oral proficiency.

The method relies on a step-by-step progression based on question-and-answer sessions which begin with naming common objects such as doors, pencils, floors, etc. It provides a motivating start as the learner begins using a foreign language almost immediately. Lessons progress to verb forms and other grammatical structures with the goal of learning about thirty new words per lesson.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;

=== The series method ===
{{tone|section|date=April 2018}}

In the 19th century, [[François Gouin]] went to [[Hamburg]] to learn [[German language|German]]. Based on his experience as a [[Latin]] teacher, he thought the best way to do this would be memorize a German grammar book and a table of its 248 irregular verbs. However, when he went to the academy to test his new language skills, he was disappointed to find out that he could not understand anything. Trying again, he similarly memorized the 800 root words of the language as well as re-memorizing the grammar and verb forms. However, the results were the same. During this time, he had isolated himself from people around him, so he tried to learn by listening, imitating and conversing with the Germans around him, but found that his carefully constructed sentences often caused native German speakers to laugh. Again he tried a more classical approach, translation, and even memorizing the entire dictionary but had no better luck.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;

When he returned home, he found that his three-year-old nephew had learned to speak French. He noticed the boy was very curious and upon his first visit to a mill, he wanted to see everything and be told the name of everything.  After digesting the experience silently, he then reenacted his experiences in play, talking about what he learned to whoever would listen or to himself. Gouin decided that language learning was a matter of transforming perceptions into conceptions, using language to represent what one experiences. Language is not an arbitrary set of conventions but a way of thinking and representing the world to oneself. It is not a conditioning process, but one in which the learner actively organizes his perceptions into linguistics concepts.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;

The series method is a variety of the direct method in that experiences are directly connected to the target language. Gouin felt that such direct "translation" of experience into words, makes for a "living language". (p59) Gouin also noticed that children organize concepts in succession of time, relating a sequence of concepts in the same order. Gouin suggested that students learn a language more quickly and retain it better if it is presented through a chronological sequence of events. Students learn sentences based on an action such as leaving a house in the order in which such would be performed. Gouin found that if the series of sentences are shuffled, their memorization becomes nearly impossible. For this, Gouin preceded psycholinguistic theory of the 20th century. He found that people will memorize events in a logical sequence, even if they are not presented in that order. He also discovered a second insight into memory called "incubation". Linguistic concepts take time to settle in the memory. The learner must use the new concepts frequently after presentation, either by thinking or by speaking, in order to master them. His last crucial observation was that language was learned in sentences with the verb as the most crucial component. Gouin would write a series in two columns: one with the complete sentences and the other with only the verb. With only the verb elements visible, he would have students recite the sequence of actions in full sentences of no more than twenty-five sentences. Another exercise involved having the teacher solicit a sequence of sentences by basically ask him/her what s/he would do next. While Gouin believed that language was rule-governed, he did not believe it should be explicitly taught.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;

His course was organized on elements of human society and the natural world. He estimated that a language could be learned with 800 to 900 hours of instruction over a series of 4000 exercises and no homework. The idea was that each of the exercises would force the student to think about the vocabulary in terms of its relationship with the natural world. While there is evidence that the method can work extremely well, it has some serious flaws. One of which is the teaching of subjective language, where the students must make judgments about what is experienced in the world (e.g. "bad" and "good") as such do not relate easily to one single common experience. However, the real weakness is that the method is entirely based on one experience of a three-year-old. Gouin did not observe the child's earlier language development such as naming (where only nouns are learned) or the role that stories have in human language development. What distinguishes the series method from the direct method is that vocabulary must be learned by translation from the native language, at least in the beginning.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;

=== Communicative language teaching ===
{{main article|Communicative language teaching}}
Communicative language teaching (CLT), also known as ''the Communicative Approach'', emphasizes interaction as both the means and the ultimate goal of learning a language. Despite a number of criticisms&lt;ref&gt;[http://tonvanhattum.com.br/comreth.html van Hattum, Ton (2006), The Communicative Approach Rethought]&lt;/ref&gt; it continues to be popular, particularly in Europe, where [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] views on language learning and education in general dominate academic discourse. Although the 'Communicative Language Teaching' is not so much a method on its own as it is an approach.

In recent years, [[task-based language learning]] (TBLL), also known as task-based language teaching (TBLT) or task-based instruction (TBI), has grown steadily in popularity. TBLL is a further refinement of the CLT approach, emphasizing the successful completion of tasks as both the organizing feature and the basis for assessment of language instruction. Dogme language teaching shares a philosophy with TBL, although differs in approach.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Meddings, L and Thornbury, S (2009) Teaching Unplugged: Dogme in English Language Teaching. Peaslake: Delta.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dogme is a communicative approach, and encourages teaching without published textbooks and instead focusing on conversational communication among the learners and the teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Meddings |last=Luke |title=Throw away your textbooks |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/mar/26/tefl.lukemeddings |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 March 2004 |accessdate = 22 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language immersion ===
{{Main article|Language immersion}}
Language immersion in school contexts delivers academic content through the medium of a foreign language, providing support for L2 learning and first language maintenance.  There are three main types of immersion education programs in the United States: foreign language immersion, dual immersion, and indigenous immersion.

Foreign language immersion programs in the U.S. are designed for students whose home language is English. In the early immersion model, for all or part of the school day elementary school children receive their content (academic) instruction through the medium of another language: Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, etc.  In early total immersion models, children receive all the regular kindergarten and first grade content through the medium of the immersion language;&lt;ref name="Kho, Mu-Jeong 2016"&gt;Kho, Mu-Jeong (2016). How to Implant a Semiotic and Mathematical DNA into Learning English, Seoul: Booklab Publishing Co. {{ISBN|979-11-87300-04-5}} (53740), 261 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; English reading is introduced later, often in the second grade. Most content (math, science, social studies, art, music) continues to be taught through the immersion language. In early partial immersion models, part of the school day (usually 50%) delivers content through the immersion language, and part delivers it through English.  French-language immersion programs are common in Canada in the provincial school systems, as part of the drive towards [[bilingualism]] and are increasing in number in the United States in public school systems (Curtain &amp; Dahlbert, 2004). Branaman &amp; Rhodes (1998) report that between 1987 and 1997 the percentage of elementary programs offering foreign language education in the U.S. through immersion grew from 2% to 8% and Curtain &amp; Dahlberg (2004) report 278 foreign language immersion programs in 29 states. Research by Swain and others (Genesee 1987) demonstrate much higher levels of proficiency achieved by children in foreign language immersion programs than in traditional foreign language education elementary school models.

Dual immersion programs in the U.S. are designed for students whose home language is English as well as for students whose home language is the immersion language (usually Spanish).  The goal is bilingual students with mastery of both English and the immersion language. As in partial foreign language immersion academic content is delivered through the medium of the immersion language for part of the school day, and through English the rest of the school day.

Indigenous immersion programs in the U.S. are designed for American Indian communities desiring to maintain the use of the native language by delivering elementary school content through the medium of that language. Hawaiian Immersion programs are the largest and most successful in this category.

=== Silent Way ===
{{main article|Silent Way}}
The Silent Way is a discovery learning approach, invented by [[Caleb Gattegno]] in the late 1950s. The teacher is largely silent, giving more space for the students to explore the language.  Students are responsible for their own learning and are encouraged to express themselves; beginners talk about what they see, more advanced students talk about their lives and what they think.  The role of the teacher is not to model the language but to correct mistakes by giving sensitive feedback. With respect to teaching pronunciation, the Silent Way is a good example of the [[Articulatory approach for teaching pronunciation|Articulatory Approach]].

=== Community language learning ===
{{main article|Community language learning}}
The ''community language learning'' (CLL) is a method proposed by [[Charles A. Curran]] during the 1970s. It is based on the counseling approach in which the teacher is seen as a counselor. It emphasizes the sense of community in the learning group, encourages interaction as a vital aspect of learning, and it considers as a priority the students' feelings and the recognition of struggles in language acquisition. There is no syllabus or textbook to follow and it is the students themselves who determine the content of the lesson. Notably, it incorporates [[translation]] and recording techniques.

=== Suggestopedia ===
{{main article|Suggestopedia}}
Suggestopedia was a method that experienced popularity especially in past years, with both staunch supporters and very strong critics, some claiming it is based on [[pseudoscience]].

=== Natural approach ===
{{main article|Natural approach}}
The natural approach is a language teaching method developed by [[Stephen Krashen]] and [[Tracy D. Terrell]]. They emphasise the learner receiving large amounts of [[comprehensible input]]. The Natural Approach can be categorized as part of the [[comprehension approach]] to language teaching.

=== Total physical response ===
{{main article|Total physical response}}
In total physical response (TPR), the instructor gives the students commands in the target language and the students act those commands out using whole-body responses. This can be categorized as part of the [[comprehension approach]] to language teaching.

=== Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling ===
{{main article|Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling}}
Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling (TPR Storytelling or TPRS) was developed by Blaine Ray, a language teacher in California, in the 1990s. At first it was an offshoot of [[Total Physical Response]] that also included storytelling, but it has evolved into a method in its own right and has gained a large following among teachers, particularly in the United States. TPR Storytelling can be categorized as part of the [[comprehension approach]] to language teaching.

===Dogme language teaching===
{{Main article|Dogme language teaching}}
Dogme language teaching is considered to be both a methodology and a movement. Dogme is a communicative approach to language teaching and encourages teaching without published textbooks and instead focusing on conversational communication among the learners and the teacher. It has its roots in an article by the language education author, Scott Thornbury. The Dogme approach is also referred to as “Dogme ELT”, which reflects its origins in the ELT (English language teaching) sector. Although Dogme language teaching gained its name from an analogy with the Dogme 95 film movement (initiated by Lars von Trier), the connection is not considered close.

=== Growing Participator Approach ===
The [[Growing Participator Approach]] (GPA) is an alternative way of thinking about second language acquisition, developed by [https://growingparticipatorapproach.blogspot.com/ Greg Thomson]. GPA as an approach is usually implemented using Thomson's Six Phase Program (SPP) method, which involves 1,500 hours of special growth participation activities, supported by a local native language speaker, and targeted towards the learners growth zone ([[Zone of proximal development]]). The Six Phase Program utilises a number of techniques, such as TPR, to quickly grow the leaners comprehension ability without the use of English. The goal is to help learners continually 'grow' in their ability to meaningful 'participate' in the host culture. GPA influences include [[Lev Vygotsky|Vygotsky]], as well as "the psycholinguistics of comprehension and production, usage-based approaches to language, linguistic anthropology and discourse analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://growingparticipatorapproach.blogspot.com/|title=Growing Participator Approach to a host world (An Alternative to "Second Language Acquisition")|website=growingparticipatorapproach.blogspot.com|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Proprietary methods==
Some methods are tied to a particular company or school, and are not used in mainstream teaching. Besides those mentioned below, there are dozens of competitors, each slightly different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lang1234.com/ |title=Find better language courses: Impartial reviews of 70 self-study programs|publisher=globe1234.com |accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable are the computer courses which use speech recognition to give feedback on pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lang1234.info/3/category/scored/1.html/ |title=Scoring Your Pronunciation|publisher=globe1234.com |accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pimsleur method===
Pimsleur language learning system is based on the research of and model programs developed by American language teacher [[Paul Pimsleur]]. It involves recorded 30-minute lessons to be done daily, with each lesson typically featuring a dialog, revision, and new material. Students are asked to translate phrases into the target language, and occasionally to respond in the target language to lines spoken in the target language. The instruction starts in the student's language but gradually changes to the target language. Several all-audio programs now exist to teach various languages using the Pimsleur Method. The syllabus is the same in all languages.

===Michel Thomas Method===
{{Main article|Michel Thomas Method}}
Michel Thomas Method is an audio-based teaching system developed by Michel Thomas, a language teacher in the USA. It was originally done in person, although since his death it is done via recorded lessons. The instruction is done entirely in the student's own language, although the student's responses are always expected to be in the target language. The method focuses on constructing long sentences with correct grammar and building student confidence. There is no listening practice, and there is no reading or writing. The syllabus is ordered around the easiest and most useful features of the language, and as such is different for each language.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Thomas: The Learning Revolution, by Jonathan Solity.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2076">'''Lars Bo''' (29 May 1924 – 21 October 1999) was a Danish artist and writer. He is known for his graphic works with [[surrealism|surrealistically]] inspired fantastic motifs. He was nicknamed "Wizard".

Lars Bo worked with P. Rostrup Bøyesen at [[Statens Museum for Kunst]] in the period from 1939 to 1940, and he went to The Danish Design School from 1941 to 1943, after which he travelled in Europe. From 1947 until his death in 1999 he lived in Paris.

From 1948 to 1950 Lars Bo worked in Johnny Friedläender and Albert Flocons graphic studio in Paris. Lars Bo wrote the novel ''Det vidunderlige hus i Paris'' (The Wonderful House in Paris).

Lars Bo moved to Paris in the early 1950s to study art and printmaking techniques at the famous Atelier 17, under the directorship of [[Stanley William Hayter]]. Bo began a long and successful career as an artist of the illustrated book in 1952. Until 1996 he produced etchings and [[aquatint]]s for many great illustrated books. Some of his greatest works in this field is for classic editions of [[Hans Christian Andersen]].

Lars Bo began exhibiting his individual prints and paintings in Paris in 1954. Shortly thereafter he became a leading artist for the French periodical, [[Le Monde]]. By 1960 Bo had established an international reputation (especially for his original prints) and exhibitions of his art were held in England, the United States and Japan.

'''Learning to read''' is the acquisition and practice of the skills necessary to understand the meaning behind printed words. For a fairly good reader, the skill of reading often feels simple, effortless, and automatic;&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rayner|first=Keith|year=2001|title=How psychological science informs the teaching of reading|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/pspi/pdf/pspi22.pdf|journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest|series=2|volume=2|pages=31–74|doi=10.1111/1529-1006.00004|author2=Barbara Foorman|author3=Charles A. Perfetti|author4=David Pesetsky|author5=Mark S. Seidenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the process of learning to read is complex and builds on cognitive, linguistic, and social skills developed from a very early age.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;

==Writing systems==
{{Main|Writing system}}

Usually, in order to understand a text, it is necessary to understand the spoken language associated with that text. In this way, writing systems are distinguished from many other symbolic communication systems.&lt;ref name="Daniels"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The World's Writing Systems]] |year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn= 0-19-507993-0|editor=Daniels, Peter T. |editor2=William Bright}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once established, writing systems on the whole change more slowly than their spoken counterparts, and often preserve features and expressions which are no longer current in the spoken language. The great benefit of writing systems is their ability to maintain a persistent record of information expressed in a language, which can be retrieved independently of the initial act of formulation.&lt;ref name="Daniels"/&gt;

==Acquiring reading==
A child's ability to learn to read, known as [[reading readiness]], begins in infancy, as the child begins attending to the speech signals in their environment and begins producing spoken language.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Maryanne |author2=Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=81–83 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children make some use of all the material that they are presented with, including every [[perception]], [[concept]] and [[word]] that they come in contact with; thus the environment in which a child develops affects the child's ability to learn to read.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt; The amount of time that a child spends together with [[parents]] or other important caregivers while listening to them read is a good predictor of the level of reading that the child will attain later in life.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fields|first=Tiffany|title=Touch Therapy|year=2000|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=New York|isbn=0-443-05791-5|pages=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a child sits with a caregiver, looking at pictures and listening to stories, they will slowly learn that all the different lines on each page make different symbols and then that together these symbols refer to words.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt;  Taking time to read to children is the most important precursor to a child's [[Training and development|development]] of reading.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt; Preschool-aged children with limited exposure to books and reading in their home, including limited experience of being read to, are at risk of reading difficulties.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt; For example, these children tend to have less exposure to literary phrases, such as "Once upon a time",&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt; and have smaller vocabularies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Biemiller|first=Andrew|title=Canadian Language and Literacy Research Network|url=http://www.literacyencyclopedia.ca/pdfs/topic.php?topId=19|accessdate=20 November 2011|pages=10|format=pdf|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MyersBotting2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Myers|first1=L. |last2=Botting|first2=N. |title=Literacy in the mainstream inner-city school: Its relationship to spoken language|journal=Child Language Teaching and Therapy|volume=24 |issue=1|year=2008 |pages=95–114|issn=0265-6590 |doi=10.1177/0265659007084570}}&lt;/ref&gt; both factors that affect the ability to read by limiting comprehension of text. The environment in which a child lives may also impact their ability to acquire reading skills. Children who are regularly exposed to chronic environmental noise pollution, such as highway traffic noise, have been known to show decreased ability to discriminate between [[phonemes]] as well as lower reading scores on standardized tests.&lt;ref name="CohenGlass1973"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Sheldon|last2=Glass|first2=David C.|last3=Singer|first3=Jerome E.|title=Apartment noise, auditory discrimination, and reading ability in children|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=9 |issue=5|year=1973 |pages=407–422 |issn=0022-1031 |doi=10.1016/S0022-1031(73)80005-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the ideal process of what is called emergent or early literacy&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt; begins in the relationship between hearing spoken language, seeing [[written language]] and feeling loved. The positive feeling that arises from spending time with books in a loving context provides a strong foundation and intrinsic [[motivation]] for the long and cognitively challenging process of learning to read.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt; However, reading to children and ensuring exposure to many [[books]] is not enough to prepare them for reading.&lt;ref name="Wolf90"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Maryanne |author2=Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=90 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another critical skill is the ability to name letters or characters.&lt;ref name="Wolf90"/&gt;

===Age to introduce literacy learning===
Some scholars favor a developmentally appropriate approach in which formal instruction on reading begins when children are about six or seven years old, while others favor limited amounts of literacy instruction at the age of four and five, in addition to non-academic, intellectually stimulating activities.&lt;ref name="vanKleeck2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Kleeck | first1 = A. | last2 = Schuele | first2 = C.

Some parents teach their children to read as babies. Babies learn to read differently and more easily than children who learn to read in school from formal instruction. The most important aspect of early (baby) reading is interaction with loving parents and bonding.&lt;ref&gt;Paraphrased quote from Dr. Richard Gentry (Ph.D Reading Education).

In a discussion on academic kindergartens, professor of child development [[David Elkind]] has argued that, since "there is no solid research demonstrating that early academic training is superior to (or worse than) the more traditional, hands-on model of early education", educators should defer to developmental approaches that provide young children with ample time and opportunity to explore the natural world on their own terms.&lt;ref name="Elkind"&gt;{{cite journal|first=David |last=Elkind |title=Much Too Early| journal= Education Next|year= 2001 |url=http://educationnext.org/much-too-early/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elkind emphasized the principle that "early education must start with the child, not with the subject matter to be taught."&lt;ref name="Elkind" /&gt;

Sebastian Suggate, Elaine Reese. pp. 181–190.&lt;/ref&gt; A German study of 50 kindergartens compared children who, at age 5, had spent a year either "academically focused", or "play-arts focused" and found that in time the two groups became inseparable in reading skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Suggate | first1 = S.

==Reading development==
{{tone|date=July 2012}}
There are five stages of reading development.  They are the emerging pre-reader, novice reader, decoding reader, fluent comprehending reader, and the expert reader. It is normal that children will move through these different stages at different rates.

===Emerging pre-reader===
The emerging pre-reader stage, also known as [[reading readiness]], happens when a young child sits and listens to someone read to them. Emerging reading takes many years of language experience, along with the increase of both conceptual and social development.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;  Showing that this process starts early in a child's life is the fact that children typically produce their first few words before their first birthday.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;  This emerging pre-reader stage usually lasts for the first five years of a child's life.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Maryanne |author2=Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=115–139 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the emerging pre-reader stage children will often "read" books and stories. They will tell the story as they have memorized it and turn the pages appropriately. They call what they are doing "reading" since they typically don't yet understand that their parents or caregivers are decoding written words. To them, they are doing what they think their parents or caregivers are doing when reciting the story.

One group of researchers in the United States found in the late 1990s and 2000s that the traditional way of reading to children made little difference in their later ability to read, and hypothesized this was because children spend relatively little time actually looking at the text.  They found that simple exercises during reading which directed children to pay attention to and think about letters and words made a significant difference in early reading progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/05/29/153927743/small-change-in-reading-to-preschoolers-can-help-disadvantaged-kids-catch-up | title=Small Change In Reading To Preschoolers Can Help Disadvantaged Kids Catch Up|agency=NPR|author=Alix Spegel|date=2012-05-29|accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novice reader===
[[File:School in Laos - Reading time.jpg|thumb|Reading time at a primary school in rural Laos. Learning to read poses different challenges in Laos compared to English-speaking countries. The written language follows clear phonetic rules, so the mechanics of reading are easier than with English. However, children learn from a teacher with a blackboard, and get little or no opportunity to improve their reading skills by reading for pleasure. Most schools have no library and no books except textbooks; even fourth-grade students often cannot read a full sentence. The daily reading period shown here uses books provided by Big Brother Mouse, which promotes reading in Lao schools and villages.]]The next step in the learning to read process is the novice reading stage&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;  also known as selective association.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;  This begins with the child learning to decode print and understanding the meaning of what has been decoded.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; To do this, the child must first figure out the [[Alphabetic principle]] and master it in only a few years.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; Most children know that the words on a page in a [[book]] mean something, but do not readily understand how the letters code the meaning.  They know that these [[words]] are made of the sounds of their particular [[language]], and that letters convey these sounds.  Novice readers learn to hear and manipulate the smaller sounds into syllables and words.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; If a child is able to master this skill, called [[phonological awareness]], it is one of the best predictors of a child's success in learning to read.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; One way that you can teach children to become more aware of sounds within words is through such things as [[nursery rhymes]] that enhance the child's ability to hear and divide the structure of words.  Another way to teach a child to read is through little "games" in which the sounds in word are either clapped, written or danced to a beat.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; A novice reader will also memorize the most common letter patterns in their own language and most of the frequent words that will not necessarily follow the phonological rules such as in English the words "have" and "who".&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; It is in this stage that children will develop a vocabulary of words that is between 2,500 and 5,000 words.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt; Children's vocabularies continue to grow as they enter elementary school, since they will continue to learn new words at a rate of about seven words per day.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt; This shows that at this stage in reading the best piece of advice is to just practice, practice, practice or read, read more, and read again.

===Decoding reader===
The transition from the novice reader stage to the decoding stage is marked by the absence of painful [[pronunciation]]s and in its place the sounds of a smoother, more confident reader.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; In this phase of learning to read, the reader adds at least 3,000 words to what they can decode. For example, in the English language, that readers need to now learn the variations of the vowel-based [[rhyme]]s and [[vowel]] pairs. It is essential during this stage, if a reader is going to become fluent, the reader needs to acquire a sufficient repertoire of the letter-patterns and vowel-pairs that help to make up words that go beyond the basic level.The faster a child can see that the word "together" is "to-ge-ther", the faster the reader will become a more fluent reader.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;
As children move forward with their reading skills, they learn a great deal about what is really inside a [[word]]; the stem, roots, [[prefixes]] and [[suffixes]] that make up [[morphemes]] of the [[language]].&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;  By this stage, children already know about the common bound morphemes such as "s" and "ed" because these are attached to many words.  Decoding readers become exposed to many types of morphemes such as prefixes and suffixes, and it is when they learn to read these as "sight chunks" that their reading and their understanding will speed up dramatically. Being able to read at a fluent level is not only about how fast a child can read, but it is a matter of being able to utilize all the special knowledge that they have about a word—its letters, letter patterns, meanings, grammatical functions, roots, and endings—fast enough that they have time to think and comprehend what they are seeing.  The point of becoming a proficient reader is to fluently read and comprehend what had just been read. Decoding readers are just beginning to understand and learn how to use their expanding knowledge of language and their growing powers of inference to figure out what they are really reading.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;

In the beginning of the decoding stage a child will often be devoting so much mental capacity to the process of decoding that they will have no comprehension of the meaning of the words being read. This is most likely if the text being read is at or above their skill level. It is nevertheless an important stage. Such decoding practice allows the child to improve their decoding skills with the ultimate goal of becoming automatic as it is for most skilled readers with most text they encounter. Like every skill, the more you do it the better you get. Though comprehension may be poor at this stage, it is nevertheless an important step towards comprehension. As the skill of decoding improves and the more automatic it becomes the more the child has mental capacity to devote to comprehension. Therefore, understanding of what is being read increases.

It is also in the decoding phase that the child will learn to go beyond what is said in writing in the story to get the underlying meaning of what the story is really about. In the decoding stage a child also learns that if a sentence or paragraph is not understood, re-reading it a second or third time may be necessary in order to fully understand the passage.  Knowing when a text needs to be re-read is a very important skill and can improve comprehension greatly.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;

===Fluent, comprehending reader===
The next stage in reading development is the fluent, comprehending reader stage, in which children shift from learning to read, to reading to learn.  In this stage the reader builds up a substantial background of knowledge of spelling.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; It is during this time in a reader's development that teachers and parents can be tricked by fluent-sounding reading into thinking that a [[child]] understands everything that they are reading. As the content of what they are able to read  becomes more demanding, good readers will develop knowledge of [[figurative language]] and [[irony]] which helps them to discover new meanings in the text. This will assist them to understand the meaning of what they are reading beyond what is written on the page.  While learning to read, one of the most powerful moments is when fluent comprehending readers learn to enter into the lives of imagined heroes and heroines.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; Examples of books where these imagined heroes and heroines could be found in include [[Harry Potter]], [[Lord of the Rings]], [[Huckleberry Finn]].  The comprehension process grows while reading books like these, where children learn how to connect prior knowledge, predict good or bad consequences, draw inferences from every danger-filled corner, monitor gaps in their understanding, and interpret how each new clue, revelation, or added piece of knowledge changes what they know. In learning these new skills, they learn to unpeel the layers of meaning in a [[word]], a [[phrase]] or a [[thought]].&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;

There are two ways in which increasing fluency can be supported.  They include explicit instruction in comprehension by a child's teacher and the child's own desire to read. Engaging in conversation about what they are reading allows the beginning reader to ask critical [[questions]], facilitating a better understanding of the central meaning.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;

At the end of this stage, before the reader becomes an expert reader, many processes are starting to become automatic. This increasing automaticity frees up cognitive resources so that the reader can reflect on meaning.  With the decoding process almost automatic by this point, the brain learns to integrate more [[metaphorical]], inferential, [[analogical]], background and [[experiential knowledge]] with every newly won millisecond.  This stage in learning to read often will last until early adulthood.&lt;ref name="Wolf143"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Maryanne |author2=Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=143 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expert reader===
The final stage in learning to read, is the expert stage.  When a reader is at this stage of reading, it will usually only take them one half second to read almost any word.&lt;ref name="Wolf145"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Maryanne |author2=Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=145 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The degree to which expert reading will change over the course of an [[adult]]'s life depends on what a person reads and how much they read.&lt;ref name="Wolf156"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Maryanne |author2=Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=156 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a person matures, life experiences as well as the cognitive process of reading text shapes reading comprehension.  It is this interpretive response that adds depth to reading and will often take the reader in a new direction from where the [[author]] intended.&lt;ref name="Wolf156"/&gt;

==Methods of teaching reading==

===Alphabetic languages===
Educators have argued for years about which method is best to teach reading to children. For the English language, there are two major methods, [[Phonics]] and [[Whole language|Whole Language]], within which there are subtypes [[Synthetic phonics|Synthetic Phonics]] and [[Sight word]] respectively. Each method is employed at differing rates depending on the country and the specific school division. Some educators are beginning to use the two methods in conjunction to maximize the benefits of both methods.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;
[[Phonics]] is a teaching method that stresses character-sound correspondences,&lt;ref name='Neural Representations'&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borowsky R, Esopenko C, Cummine J, Sarty GE |title=Neural representations of visual words and objects: a functional MRI study on the modularity of reading and object processing |journal= Brain Topogr |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=89–96 |year=2007 |pmid=17929158 |doi=10.1007/s10548-007-0034-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Ventral and Dorsal Streams'&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borowsky R, Cummine J, Owen WJ, Friesen CK, Shih F, Sarty GE |title=FMRI of ventral and dorsal processing streams in basic reading processes: insular sensitivity to phonology |journal=Brain Topogr |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=233–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16845597 |doi=10.1007/s10548-006-0001-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Chinese Ventral and Dorsal Streams'&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chan ST, Tang SW, Tang KW, Lee WK, Lo SS, Kwong KK |title=Hierarchical coding of characters in the ventral and dorsal visual streams of Chinese language processing |journal=NeuroImage |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=423–35 |date = November 2009|pmid=19591947 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.06.078}}&lt;/ref&gt; specific rules and their use in reading and spelling.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name='Changes Reading Strategies'&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Sanabria Díaz G, Torres Mdel R, Iglesias J, etal |title=Changes in reading strategies in school-age children |journal=Span J Psychol |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=441–53 |date = November 2009|pmid=19899646 |doi=10.1017/S1138741600001827}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This helps beginning readers understand how characters are linked to sounds ([[phonemes]]), patterns of letter-sound correspondences and spelling in English, and how to apply this knowledge when they read to sound out words. Phonics teachers present the spellings for different sounds in a specific order, introducing the simplest (or most useful) patterns early on; these patterns are then practiced.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt; A disadvantage to phonics is that in some languages like English, complex letter-sound correspondences can cause confusion for beginning readers.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rayner|first=Keith|author2=Barbara Foorman |author3=Charles Perfetti |author4=David Pesetsky |author5=Mark Seidenberg |title=How Should Reading be Taught?|journal=Scientific American|date=March 2002|pages=84–91 |format=pdf |url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/pspi/reading.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional phonics instruction has marked benefits. Early reading often involves significant expansion of a child's mental lexicon, which includes all the words the child has been exposed to and their meanings. By focusing on the principle of linking specific sounds and characters, the child has the ability to recognize new words and derive meaning from them. Being able to adapt what they know about language to new words they experience is crucial to expanding their mental lexicon; this allows for productive reading that is the ability to read new words.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2002"/&gt; It also produces higher achievement for beginning readers and the difference is the greatest for those at risk of failing to learn to read. While some children are able to infer these rules on their own, some need explicit instructions on phonics rules. Overall, children who are directly taught phonics are better at reading, spelling and comprehension.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;

Traditional phonics instruction can also have the unintended consequence of promoting dysfluency. The difficulty lies in the [[Coarticulation|coarticulated]] nature of speech; speech sounds are overlapping,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carello C, LeVasseur VM, Schmidt RC |title=Movement sequencing and phonological fluency in (putatively) nonimpaired readers |journal=Psychol Sci |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=375–9 |date = July 2002|pmid=12137142 |doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2002.00467.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; while print is discrete and sequential. This can be appreciated if one shapes the mouth in position to begin to produce the word ''cat'' compared to the word ''cot''. The initial hard ''c'' is colored by the subsequent vowel even before speech begins, i.e., the smiling position as one prepares to say ''cat'', and the more limp position as one prepares to say ''cot''. As early readers work from left to right, beginning with the onset consonant, they typically do not yet know the vowel with which it must be coarticulated. The vowel sound itself cannot be known until the remaining rime (the portion of the syllable beginning with the vowel and extending to its end: e.g. ''ight'' in ''right'') is fully encountered. For these reasons, teaching reading through orientation to rime first and then adding the onset (ought-bought) can be helpful in promoting fluency through supporting the phonological problems of coarticulation. Emphasis on the rime also supports the development of an intuitive, and therefore more fluent, awareness of orthographic patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Cherkes-Julkowski, M. (2005). find the "vawel", Read the Rime, Learn to Read. Apache Junction, AZ: Surviving Education Guides.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Synthetic phonics|Synthetic Phonics]] is a method that is endorsed by the governments of the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Review of the Primary Curriculum: Final Report|url=https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/Primary_curriculum_Report.pdf|publisher=DCSF Publications|accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teaching Reading: Report and Recommendations|url=http://www.dest.gov.au/nitl/documents/report_recommendations.pdf|publisher=Commonwealth Copyright|accessdate=14 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812024503/http://www.dest.gov.au/nitl/documents/report_recommendations.pdf|archivedate=12 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Rhona|title=A Seven Year Study of the Effects of Synthetic Phonics Teaching on Reading and Spelling Attainment|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/02/20682/52383|accessdate=14 November 2011|author2=Joyce E Watson |date=11 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has considerable support in the U.S.A.&lt;ref name="NICHD, 2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm |title=Findings and Determinations of the National Reading Panel by Topic Areas |format= |work=NICHD Publications and Materials |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705194256/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm |archivedate=2008-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Reading Strategy: The Report of the Expert Panel on Early Reading in Ontario|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/document/reports/reading/reading.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Education|accessdate=14 November 2011|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Synthetic Phonics, the student first learns to say the sounds ([[phonemes]]) that are associated with the character([[graphemes]]) in isolation before the sounds are "synthesized" or blended together to make a word. (e.g. /a/, /k/, /t/.) Then, when reading a word, he learns to say each sound in the word (e.g. /k/ - /a/ - /t/); and to "blend" these sounds into a pronunciation of the word (e.g. "cat").

Synthetic phonics does not teach whole words as shapes; and does not involve guessing at words from context, picture and initial letter clues.

There are other types of phonics, such as [[Analytical phonics]], that differ in their approach based on how a "chunk" within the word is defined (i.e. individual phonemes, syllables, or non-blended units).

[[Whole language|Whole Language]] is widely used in the U.S.A. and Canada. It is a reading and learning method that trains students to focus on words, sentences and paragraphs as a whole rather than letters. This method aims to make reading fun and keep children motivated, which is beneficial because learning to read depends heavily on what the student does and not the teacher.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt; While the child is typically very engaged in this method, many children struggle to infer the specific rules of the language on their own, which causes the child's decoding and spelling to suffer during development.&lt;ref name="National Reading Panel, 2000, Summary" /&gt;

One subtype is [[Sight word]], which is sometimes called the "look-say" method. A sight vocabulary of 50-100 words is first memorized&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2002"/&gt;  and subsequent words are learned as wholes, often by seeing them used repeatedly in the context of a story.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt; It tells children to find meaning by guessing, by recognizing whole words they have memorized, by looking at the pictures, and by creating a context based on surrounding words. It encourages students to "construct their own meaning" (with guidance from peers and facilitator of consensus process).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weatherly|first=Cynthia|title=GLOSSARY of Education Terms|url=http://www.crossroad.to/glossary/education.html#whole|work=Brave New Schools|accessdate=14 November 2011|author2=Sarah Leslie |author3=Charlotte Iserbyt |author4=Marla Quenzer |author5=Betty Lewis |author6=Elizabeth Stoner }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It relies heavily on the child's experience with language as a whole.
The following are some features of the whole language philosophy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the whole language philosophy?|url=http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/ReferenceMaterials/glossaryofliteracyterms/WhatIsTheWholeLanguagePhilosop.htm|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Children are expected to learn to read and write as they learned to talk, that is gradually, without a great deal of direct instruction.
*Learning is emphasized more than teaching; it is assumed that the children will learn to read and write, and the teacher facilitates that growth.
*Children read and write every day in a variety of situations.
*Reading, writing, and spoken language are not considered separate components of the curriculum or merely ends in themselves; rather they permeate everything the children are doing.
*There is no division between first ''learning to read'' and later ''reading to learn''. (adapted from Weaver, C. 1990)
&lt;br /&gt;
Which style use in teaching reading has divided educators for years. It is now known that using the two approaches together is more powerful than either program alone.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt; The technical skills learned through phonics are important for many children when learning to read, spell, and general language comprehension and engagement of children in the whole-language approach is also important to keep the children motivated and excited to learn. Many teachers and schools acknowledge this and say that they use multiple methods to teach children to read.

=== Logographic languages ===

Languages such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]] are normally written in [[logograms]] ([[hanzi]] and [[kanji]], respectively), which represent a whole word or [[morpheme]] with a single character.  There are a large number of characters, and the sound that each makes must be learned directly or from other characters which contain "hints" in them, such as, in Japanese, 民's [[On reading#On.27yomi .28Chinese reading.29|on-reading]] being min and 眠 which shares the same on-reading as  民, that being min. In the same way whereas the right part contains the characters pronunciation, 員's on-reading is in and 韻 has exactly the same on, however this is not true for all characters. Kun readings, on the other hand, have to be learned and memorised as there is no way to tell from each character.

[[Ruby character]]s are used in textbooks to help children learn the sounds that each logogram makes.  These are written in a smaller size, using an alphabetic or [[Syllabary|syllabic]] script.  For example, [[hiragana]] is typically used in Japanese, and the [[pinyin]] [[romanization]] into Latin alphabet characters is used in Chinese.

The examples above spell the word ''kanji'', which is made up of two kanji characters: 漢 (''kan'', written in hiragana as かん), and 字 (''ji'', written in hiragana as じ).

Textbooks are sometimes edited as a cohesive set across grades so that children will not encounter logograms they are not yet expected to have learned.

==Skills required for proficient reading==
{{Globalize|section|date=July 2010}}
According to the report by the US [[National Reading Panel]] (NRP) in 2000,

Other important skills are: [[rapid automatized naming]] (RAN),&lt;ref name="Lervåg"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lervåg A, Hulme C | year = 2009 | title = Rapid automatized naming (RAN) taps a mechanism that places constraints on the development of early reading fluency | url = | journal = Psychol.

''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Writing Systems''. Oxford: Blackwell, p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; and practice.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;

*'''[[Speech perception|Speech Awareness]]''': The awareness of individual parts of speech as they apply to individual written characters is crucial for understanding reading (as defined by translating written characters into spoken language). [[Phonological awareness]], which includes the manipulation of [[rhymes]], [[syllable]]s, and [[syllable onset|onsets]] and [[syllable rime|rimes]], is most prevalent in Alphabetic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehri|first=Linnea|author2=Simone Nunes |author3=Dale Willows |author4=Barbara Valeska Schuster |author5=Zohreh Yaghoub-Zadeh |author6=Timothy Shanahan |title=Phonemic awareness instruction helps children learn to read: Evidence from the National Reading Panel's meta-analysis|journal=Reading Research Quarterly|date=July–September 2001|volume=36|issue=3|pages=250–287 |jstor=748111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The important part of speech depends on the [[Writing system]] employed.
* '''[[Fluency]]''': The ability to read orally with speed, accuracy, and [[vocal]] expression. The ability to read fluently is one of several critical factors necessary for reading comprehension. If a reader is not fluent, it may be difficult to remember what has been read and to relate the ideas expressed in the text to their background knowledge. This accuracy and automaticity of reading serves as a bridge between decoding and comprehension.&lt;ref name="Rasinski, T"/&gt;
* '''[[Vocabulary]]''': A critical aspect of reading comprehension is vocabulary development.&lt;ref name="Justice 2002 87–106"/&gt; When a reader encounters an unfamiliar word in print and decodes it to derive its spoken pronunciation, the reader understands the word if it is in the reader's spoken vocabulary. Otherwise, the reader must derive the meaning of the word using another strategy, such as context. If the development of the child's vocabulary is impeded by things such as ear infections, that inhibit the child from hearing new words consistently, then the development of reading will also be impaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Maryanne |author2=Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=104–105 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Reading comprehension]]''': The NRP describes comprehension as a complex [[cognitive]] process in which a reader intentionally and interactively engages with the text. Reading comprehension is heavily dependent on skilled word recognition and decoding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kendeou P, Savage R, van den Broek P |title=Revisiting the simple view of reading |journal=Br J Educ Psychol |volume=79 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=353–70 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19091164 |doi=10.1348/978185408X369020 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; oral reading fluency, a well-developed vocabulary and active engagement with the text.&lt;ref name="Fien 2010 631–653"/&gt;
*'''[[Rapid automatized naming]]''': The ability to say quickly the names of letters, objects and colors predicts an individual's ability to read. This might be linked to the importance of quick retrieval of [[phonological]] representations from [[long-term memory]] in reading and the importance of object-naming circuits in the left [[cerebral hemisphere]] that are recruited to underpin a child's word-recognition abilities.&lt;ref name="Lervåg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Denckla MB 1974"/&gt;
*'''[[Orthography]]''' describes or defines the set of symbols used in a language, and the rules about how to write these symbols.  Orthographic Development proceeds in increasing complexity as a child learns to read. Some of the first things to be learnt are the orthographic conventions such as the direction of reading and that there are differing typefaces and capitalization for each symbol.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; In general, this means that to read proficiently, the reader has to understand elements of the written language including [[hyphen]]ation, [[capitalization]], [[word|word breaks]], [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], and [[punctuation]].&lt;ref name="Coulmas, Florian 1996. p. 379"/&gt;
* '''Practice''': repeated exposure to print improves many aspects of learning to read and most importantly the knowledge of individual words. It increases the speed at which high frequency words are recognized which allows for increased [[Fluency]] in reading. It also supports orthographic development,&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; [[Reading comprehension]] and [[Vocabulary]] development.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;

==Reading difficulties==
Difficulties in reading typically involve difficulty with one or more of the following: decoding, reading rate, reading fluency, or reading comprehension.

===Decoding===
{{Main|Dyslexia}}
Difficulty with decoding is marked by having not acquired the [[phoneme]]-[[grapheme]] mapping concept. One specific disability characterized by poor decoding is [[dyslexia]], defined as brain-based type of learning disability that specifically impairs a person's ability to read.&lt;ref name="nih"&gt;{{cite web|title=NINDS Dyslexia Information Page|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyslexia/dyslexia.htm|publisher=[[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]]|accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These individuals typically read at levels significantly lower than expected despite having normal intelligence. It can also be inherited in some families, and recent studies have identified a number of genes that may predispose an individual to developing dyslexia. Although the symptoms vary from person to person, common characteristics among people with dyslexia are difficulty with spelling, phonological processing (the manipulation of sounds), and/or rapid visual-verbal responding.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;  Adults, can have either developmental dyslexia&lt;ref name='Heim'&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Heim S, Tschierse J, Amunts K |title=Cognitive subtypes of dyslexia |journal=Acta Neurobiologiae Experimentalis |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=73–82 |year=2008 |pmid=18389017 |url=http://www.ane.pl/linkout.php?pii=6809 |issn=0065-1400}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Facoetti A |title=Auditory and visual automatic attention deficits in developmental dyslexia |journal=Brain Res Cogn Brain Res |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=185–91 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12668226 |doi=10.1016/S0926-6410(02)00270-7 |url= |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Lorusso ML |author3=Paganoni P |display-authors=3 |last4=Cattaneo |first4=Carmen |last5=Galli |first5=Raffaella |last6=Umiltà |first6=Carlo |last7=Mascetti |first7=Gian Gastone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=anchoring&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Ahissar M |title=Dyslexia and the anchoring-deficit hypothesis |journal=Trends Cogn.

===Reading rate===
Individuals with reading rate difficulties tend to have accurate word recognition and normal comprehension abilities, but the reading speed is below grade level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Catts, Hugh William |author2=Kamhi, Alan G. |title=The connections between language and reading disabilities |publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates |location=Hillsdale, N.J |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-8058-5001-5 |oclc=470295626 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strategies such as [[guided reading]], silent reading and modeled reading may help improve a reader's reading rate&lt;ref name="National Reading Panel, 2000, Subgroups"/&gt;

===Reading fluency===
Individuals with reading fluency difficulties fail to maintain a fluid, smooth pace when reading. Strategies used for overcoming reading rate difficulties are also useful in addressing reading fluency issues.&lt;ref name="National Reading Panel, 2000, Subgroups"/&gt;

===Reading comprehension===
Individuals with reading comprehension difficulties are commonly described as poor comprehenders. They have normal decoding skills as well as a fluid rate of reading, but have difficulty comprehending text when read. Increasing vocabulary knowledge, listening skills and teaching basic comprehension techniques may help facilitate better [[reading comprehension]].

'''László Moholy-Nagy''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˌ|h|oʊ|l|i|ˈ|n|ɒ|dʒ}}; {{IPA-hu|ˈlaːsloː ˈmohojnɒɟ|lang}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forvo.com/word/l%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_moholy-nagy#hu Forvo.com]&lt;/ref&gt; born '''László Weisz'''; July 20, 1895 – November 24, 1946) was a Hungarian [[Painting|painter]] and [[photographer]] as well as a professor in the [[Bauhaus]] school.  He was highly influenced by [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] and a strong advocate of the integration of technology and industry into the arts.

==Early life==
Moholy-Nagy was born "László Weisz" in [[Bácsborsód]], Hungary to a [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jewish]] family.&lt;ref name="Chilvers, Ian 2009. pp. 471-472"&gt;Chilvers, Ian &amp; Glaves-Smith, John eds., ''Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art '', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009. pp. 471-472&lt;/ref&gt; His cousin was the conductor Sir [[Georg Solti]]. He attended [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in the city of [[Szeged]]. He changed his German-Jewish surname to the Magyar surname of his mother's Christian lawyer friend Nagy, who supported the family and helped raise László and his brothers when their Jewish father, Lipót Weisz left the family. Later, he added “Moholy” to his surname, after the name of the town of [[Mol (Serbia)|Mohol]] (today in [[Serbia]]) in which one part of his boyhood was spent, in the family home nearby.

[[File:László Moholy-Nagy, perpe, 1919 (coll. priv.).jpg|thumb|László Moholy-Nagy, 1919, private collection]]
In 1918, he formally converted to the [[Hungarian Reformed Church]]; his godfather was his Roman Catholic university friend, the art critic [[Iván Hevesy]]. Immediately before and during [[World War I]] he studied law in [[Budapest]] and served in the war, where he sustained a serious injury. In Budapest, on leave and during convalescence, Moholy-Nagy became involved first with the journal ''Jelenkor'' (“The Present Age”), edited by Hevesy, and then with the “Activist” circle around [[Lajos Kassák]]’s journal ''Ma'' (“Today”). After his discharge from the [[Austro-Hungarian army]] in October 1918, he attended the private art school of the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[Fauvism|Fauve]] artist [[Róbert Berény]]. He was a supporter of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], declared early in 1919, though he assumed no official role in it. After the defeat of the Communist regime in August, he withdrew to Szeged. An exhibition of his work was held there, before he left for [[Vienna]] around November 1919. He left for [[Berlin]] early in 1920.&lt;ref name="TechnicalDetours"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Botar|first1=Oliver A.I.|title=Technical Detours: The Early Moholy-Nagy Reconsidered|date=2006|publisher=Art Gallery of the Graduate Center, the City University of New York|location=New York|isbn=978-1599713571|pages=10-15, 18-20, 163-169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hacking|editor1-first=Juliet|title=Photography: The Whole Story|date=2012|publisher=Prestel Publishing|location=Munich|isbn=978-3791347349|pages=198, 199, 205, 210, 216-221, 334|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==At the Bauhaus==
[[File:László Moholy-Nagy, architettura o costruzione eccentrica, 1921 ca. (guggenheim NY).jpg|thumb|László Moholy-Nagy, ''Architecture'' (''Eccentric Construction''), c. 1921, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]]]
In 1923, Moholy-Nagy took over [[Johannes Itten|Johannes Itten's]] role co-teaching the Bauhaus preliminary course with [[Josef Albers]] and also replaced Itten as Head of the Metal Workshop.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bauhaus100.de/en/past/teaching/classes/preliminary-course-by-josef-albers/index.html Bauhaus100. Preliminary course.](Accessed: 7 February 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=metal&gt;[https://www.bauhaus100.de/en/past/teaching/workshops/metal/ Bauhaus100. Metal workshop] (Accessed: 7 February 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively marked the end of the school’s [[expressionism|expressionistic]] leanings and moved it closer towards its original aims as a school of design and industrial integration.&lt;ref name="Chilvers, Ian 2009. pp. 471-472"/&gt; The Bauhaus became known for the versatility of its artists, and Moholy-Nagy was no exception. Throughout his career, he became proficient and innovative in the fields of photography, [[typography]], sculpture, painting, printmaking, and [[industrial design]].

One of his main focuses was [[photography]], in which, from 1922, he was initially guided by the technical expertise of his wife and collaborator [[Lucia Moholy|Lucia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Moholy, Lucia | author2=Moholy-Nagy, László, 1895-1946 | title=Marginalien zu Moholy-Nagy : documentarische ungereimtheiten... = Moholy-Nagy : marginal notes : documentary absurdities | publication-date=1972 | publisher=Scherpe | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/33341707 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Findeli, A.

New York: Brewer, Warren &amp; Putnam.&lt;/ref&gt; of 1932, he coined the term [[Neues Sehen]] (New Vision) for his belief that the camera could create a whole new way of seeing the outside world that the human eye could not. This theory encapsulates his approach to his art and teaching. He was the first interwar artist to suggest the use of scientific equipment, the telescope, microscope and radiography in the making of art.&lt;ref&gt;Botar, O. (2004). Lszl Moholy-Nagys New Vision and the Aestheticization of Scientific Photography in Weimar Germany. Science in Context, 17(4), 525-556.&lt;/ref&gt; With Lucia, he experimented with the [[photogram]]; the process of exposing light-sensitive paper with objects laid upon it. His teaching practice covered a diverse range of media, including painting, [[sculpture]], photography, photomontage and metal.&lt;ref name="TechnicalDetours" /&gt;

He left the Bauhaus in 1928 and established his own design studio in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bauhaus100.de/en/past/people/masters/laszlo-moholy-nagy/ Bauhaus100. László Moholy-Nagy ] (Accessed: 7 February 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marianne Brandt]] took over his role as Head of the Metal Workshop.&lt;ref name=metal /&gt;

==Later career==
An enduring achievement was Moholy-Nagy's construction of the "''Lichtrequisit einer elektrischen Bühne''" [Light Prop for an Electric Stage] (completed 1930), a device with moving parts meant to have light projected through it in order to create mobile light reflections and shadows on nearby surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=1649&amp;page=1&amp;sole=y&amp;collab=y&amp;attr=y&amp;sort=default&amp;tabview=bio Tate bio] Retrieved January 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hatjecantz.de/controller.php?cmd=artdictionary&amp;id=32 ''Light Art''] Retrieved January 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Made with the help of the Hungarian architect Istvan Seboek for the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] exhibition held in Paris during the summer of 1930, and after his death, it was dubbed the "Light-Space Modulator" and was seen as a pioneer achievement of kinetic sculpture using industrial materials like reflective metals and [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|Plexiglas]]. Given his intention for it, it might more accurately be seen as one of the earliest examples of [[Light art|Light Art]], a form that he continued to develop in the 1940s in the United States, in ''Space Modulator'' 1939-1945'', Papmac'' 1943 and ''B-10 Space Modulator'' 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Moholy-Nagy, László |d 1895-1946 &amp; Witkovsky, Matthew S., 1967-, (editor.) &amp; Eliel, Carol S., 1955-, (editor.) &amp; Vail, Karole P. B., (editor.) &amp; Pâenichon, Sylvie, (writer of added text.) et al. (2016). Moholy-Nagy : future present (First edition). Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:László Moholy-Nagy, A 19, 1927 (Hattula Moholy-Nagy, MI).jpg|thumb|László Moholy-Nagy, ''A 19'', 1927]]
Moholy-Nagy was photography editor of the Dutch [[avant-garde]] magazine ''International Revue i 10'' from 1927 to 1929. He designed stage sets for successful and controversial operatic and theatrical productions, designed exhibitions and books, created ad campaigns, wrote articles and made films. His studio employed artists and designers such as Istvan Seboek, [[Gyorgy Kepes]] and Andor Weininger. After the [[Nazis]] came to power in Germany in 1933, and, being a foreign citizen, he was no longer allowed to work. He operated for a time in the Netherlands (doing mostly commercial work) before moving to London in 1935.&lt;ref name="Chilvers, Ian 2009. pp. 471-472" /&gt;

In England, Moholy-Nagy formed part of the circle of émigré artists and intellectuals who based themselves in [[Hampstead]]. Moholy-Nagy lived in the [[Isokon building]] with [[Walter Gropius]] for eight months and then settled in [[Golders Green]]. Gropius and Moholy-Nagy planned to establish an English version of the Bauhaus{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} but could not secure backing, and then Moholy-Nagy was turned down for a teaching job at the [[Royal College of Art]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Moholy-Nagy made his way in London by taking on various design jobs including ''[[Imperial Airways]]'' and a shop display for men's underwear. He photographed contemporary architecture for the ''[[Architectural Review]]'' where the assistant editor was [[John Betjeman]] who commissioned Moholy-Nagy to make documentary photographs to illustrate his book ''[[An Oxford University Chest]]''. In 1936, he was commissioned by fellow Hungarian film producer [[Alexander Korda]] to design special effects for ''[[Things to Come]]''. Working at [[Denham Studios]], Moholy-Nagy created kinetic sculptures and abstract light effects, but they were rejected by the film's director. At the invitation of [[Leslie Martin]], he gave a lecture to the architecture school of Hull School of Art.

==In the US==
In 1937, at the invitation of [[Walter Paepcke]], the Chairman of the [[Container Corporation of America]], Moholy-Nagy moved to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] to become the director of the [[New Bauhaus]]. The philosophy of the school was basically unchanged from that of the original, and its headquarters was the Prairie Avenue mansion that architect [[Richard Morris Hunt]] designed for department store magnate [[Marshall Field]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.id.iit.edu/about-id/history/ IIT Institute of Design History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, the school lost the financial backing of its supporters after only a single academic year, and it closed in 1938. Moholy-Nagy was also the Art Advisor for the mail-order house of Spiegel in Chicago. Paepcke, however, continued his own support, and in 1939, Moholy-Nagy opened the School of Design. In 1944, this became the [[Institute of Design IIT|Institute of Design]]. In 1949 the Institute of Design became a part of [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] and became the first institution in the United States to offer a PhD in design. Moholy-Nagy authored an account of his efforts to develop the curriculum of the School of Design in his book ''Vision in Motion''.

==Death and legacy==
Moholy-Nagy died of [[leukemia]] in [[Chicago]] in 1946. [[Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design]] in Budapest is named in his honour. The software company [[Laszlo Systems]] (developers of the [[Open source software|open source]] [[programming language]] [[OpenLaszlo]]) was named in part in honor of Moholy-Nagy. In 1998, he received a Tribute Marker from the City of Chicago. In the autumn of 2003, the Moholy-Nagy Foundation, Inc. was established as a source of information about Moholy-Nagy's life and works.&lt;ref name="Chilvers, Ian 2009. pp. 471-472"/&gt; In 2016, the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York exhibited a retrospective of Moholy-Nagy's work that included painting, film, photography, and sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/exhibition/moholy-nagy-future-present|title=Moholy-Nagy: Future Present|date=2016-02-02|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NIIT Limited''' is an Indian Multinational company that offers learning management and training delivery [[solution]]s to corporations, institutions and individuals. It has three main lines of business worldwide: Corporate Learning Group (CLG), Skills and Careers Group (SNC), and School Learning Group (SLG).

In 2006, the IT services business of NIIT was demerged into a separately listed company [[NIIT Technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;TOI Website: [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/niit-ready-for-split-formula-finalised/articleshow/757198.cms] (URL last accessed on 14 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
NIIT Limited now focuses on Corporate Training, Vocational Training for Services Sectors and Education and Training in Schools. NIIT Limited owns 23.98% of NIIT Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eqty.blogspot.in/2014/01/niit-limited-valuation-analysis.html|title=NIIT Limited holding in NIIT Technologies|date=19 January 2014|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
NIIT was established in 1981 by [[Rajendra S. Pawar]] and [[Vijay K. Thadani]], graduates from [[Indian Institute of Technology|IIT]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='NIIT pioneered IT education in India'|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/india-emerging/niit-pioneered-it-education-in-india/articleshow/10775340.cms|accessdate=10 September 2015|work=The Economic Times|agency=The Economic Times|date=18 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delhi, with one million rupees.
NIIT conceived a franchising model in IT education for the very first time, setting up nine centers by 1987.

In 1986, NIIT began its foray into the software domain, beginning with Software Product Distribution under the 'Insoft' brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIIT|url=http://www.globalrecorder.com/articles/inventions-and-discoveries/institutions/computer-education/niit|website=Global Recorder|publisher=Global Recorder|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also began offering advice and consultancy to large corporations on how to leverage technology and make optimum use of their IT investments.

In 1988, NIIT introduced many marketing and advertising strategies for the Indian market including the ‘Computerdrome’ in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIIT Institute for Hardware and Networking Courses|url=http://www.edumilestones.com/inscourse-institute-NIIT-Institute-for-Hardware-and-Networking-Courses-304|website=Edu Milestones|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another initiative launched by NIIT, was its Bhavishya Jyoti Scholarships program, launched in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NIIT Announces 25th Bhavishya Jyoti Scholarship - India's Most Significant IT &amp; New-Age Careers Scholarship Program|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.in/news-releases/niit-announces-25th-bhavishya-jyoti-scholarship---indias-most-significant-it--new-age-careers-scholarship-program-525309481.html|accessdate=10 September 2015|work=PR Newswire|agency=UBM|date=September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was targeted at deserving and socially challenged students with an aim to improve their skills and employability quotient.
In 1992, NIIT launched its flagship program GNIIT, an industry-endorsed course with a 12-month Professional Practice for students seeking careers in the IT and non-IT sectors. 
By 1993, NIIT began trading NIIT stocks on the Indian stock exchanges. In 1996, NIIT began its globalization journey, setting up an education center in Hong Kong. In the same year, the company launched its virtual university ‘Net Varsity’. In 1998, NIIT joined a handful of Indian tech companies to enter the Chinese market.
The company earned the epithet, the ‘McDonald’s of the software business’ by Far Eastern Economic Review in September, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIIT|url=http://www.superbrandsindia.com/images/brand_pdf/consumer_1st_edition_2004/niit/niit.htm|website=Super Brands India|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, NIIT launched an experiment that was christened ‘Hole-in-the-Wall’ by media and drew international attention. The experiment was based on the ‘[[minimally invasive education]]’ methodology developed by NIIT R&amp;D. It suggested that children, irrespective of their social, ethnic or educational identity could learn to use computers by themselves, without adult intervention.
In 2003, NIIT launched its MindChampions Academy (MCA) with Viswanathan Anand, five-time former World Chess champion and NIIT Brand Ambassador. 
[[File:NIIT University.jpg|thumb|NIIT University, Neemarana]]
In 2004, NIIT hived off its software business into an independent organization called NIIT Technologies Ltd. (Source: NASSCOM’s 2013-14 Ranking of Top 20 IT services companies).  
In the area of training, NIIT launched its ‘Edgeineers’ program in 2005, to boost career opportunities for engineering graduates. In the same year, it diversified into various sectors such as banking, finance and insurance (through IFBI), Executive Management education (through Imperia), Professional Life Skills, BPM, and ICT education for schools. In 2008, NIIT set up NIIT University, in [[Neemrana]], Rajasthan. NU, offers B-Tech and M-Tech programs in computer science and education technology, as well as MBA programs. 
In 2014, NIIT tied up with National Skill Development Corporation to launch NIIT Yuva Jyoti centers, under the pilot phase of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s [[Skill India]] campaign and the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) in North East, J&amp;K and Jharkhand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industry exalts Govt’s Skill India Campaign|url=http://www.indiaeducationreview.com/features/industry-exalts-govt%E2%80%99s-skill-india-campaign/19656|website=India Education Review|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Acquisitions
''' &lt;br&gt;
In 2001, NIIT acquired Osprey, DEI and Click2learn in the US, to establish its e-learning and corporate learning practices in that country.

In 2006, acquired Element K, a leading provider of learning solutions in North America.  The company was sold off in 2012.

'''NetTutor''' is a Web-based [[Online Tutoring|online tutoring]] service. The NetTutor website, trademark, and interface technology are owned by Link-Systems, International (LSI), a privately held [[Distance education|distance-learning]] software corporation in Tampa, Florida. NetTutor went live in 1996,&lt;ref name="LSIPage"/&gt; making it possibly the first private online tutoring service to provide tutoring in which the learner could choose tutoring that is either [[synchronous]] (tutor and learner live simultaneously) or [[asynchronous learning|asynchronous]] (learner submits questions and receives tutor response, similar to email); in 2016, the company announced that NetTutor had conducted three million online tutoring session.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theedadvocate.org/online-tutoring-service-reaches-industry-milestone/|title=Online Tutoring Service Reaches Industry Milestone - The Edvocate|date=2016-07-26|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; LSI also developed, maintains, and leases hosted access to the proprietary Java-based whiteboard-style interface (the [[WorldWideWhiteboard]]) with which NetTutor conducts tutoring in both modes. All NetTutor operations &amp;mdash; tutoring, management, and technical support &amp;mdash; are conducted at LSI’s main office in Tampa.&lt;ref name="BWInfo"/&gt;

==History==

Link-Systems International was launched in 1995 with the goal of making academic resources available on the Web.
The company was incorporated in the State of Florida on February 27, 1996. Net Tutor was the firm's first product and went live later that year. LSI began to lease the technology supporting NetTutor (also under the NetTutor name) in the following year.&lt;ref name="BWDigest"/&gt;

===Textbook publishers===

NetTutor was apparently the first online tutoring service to integrate with textbooks. Access to NetTutor, for instance, has been packaged with certain [[McGraw-Hill]]&lt;ref name="MH"/&gt; math, science, and accounting books since approximately 1997. Over the subsequent years, NetTutor has been packaged with higher education textbooks published by [[John Wiley and Sons]], [[Pearson Education|Pearson]], [[Cengage Learning]],&lt;ref name="CengSite"/&gt; and [[Bedford-St. Martin's|Bedford, Freeman and Worth]].

===Research on the NetTutor interface===

* Early research into NetTutor was conducted by educators eager to employ technology in their own teaching. Consequently, it focuses on technical issues such as usability and robustness, but also on the ability of participants to express themselves in effective online discussion of specialized subjects, especially mathematics. A study at [[Hampton University]] in 1999 concluded that NetTutor could effectively support such activities as online office hours.&lt;ref name="Verma1999"/&gt;
* The whiteboard-like nature of the NetTutor interface (today marketed separately by LSI as the WorldWideWhiteboard®) became known for offering tools to support subject-specific online chat and to illustrate concepts. In 2004, researchers at [[Stony Brook University]] found that "[d]espite some flaws, according to our research NetTutor remains the only workable math-friendly e-learning communication system."&lt;ref name="Smith2004"/&gt;
* Similar results were found using NetTutor technology and tutors at [[Utah Valley State College]] (in a study describing the use of NetTutor as "[o]ne of the earliest synchronous models for math  tutoring]"&lt;ref name="Turrentine2006"/&gt;) and at the [[University of Idaho]], in a study beginning in 2005&lt;ref name="Thomas2006"/&gt; &amp;mdash; showing increasing acceptance of Web-based  online tutoring in the university setting.

===Breadth of usage===

* By 2007, LSI claimed that its NetTutor tutors had conducted over one million online tutorial sessions&lt;ref name="LSI2007"/&gt; and by 2016, NetTutor had conducted more than three million tutorial sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theedadvocate.org/online-tutoring-service-reaches-industry-milestone/|title=Online Tutoring Service Reaches Industry Milestone - The Edvocate|date=2016-07-26|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The service has expanded from its initial ties with the textbook publishing industry and now directly reaches learners in a variety of  environments, such as at college-track high school programs,&lt;ref name="GearUp"/&gt; for-profit schools, programs associated with the labor movement,&lt;ref name="ALEKS"/&gt; public universities, and community colleges.

==Today==

Learners acquire access to NetTutor either by

* direct purchase of tutoring time from the NetTutor website&lt;ref name="NetTutor"/&gt;
* purchase of a textbook which has NetTutor support package with it from a publisher, ''or''
* enrollment in a school or specific courses in a school which has chosen NetTutor as the vendor for either a limited or unlimited amount of tutoring for its students.

The NetTutor service is typically integrated into an existing [[virtual learning environment]] such as a publisher Web portal, a [[learning management system]] like [[Blackboard]],&lt;ref name="BBExt"/&gt; [[Moodle]], or [[Sakai Project|Sakai]], or else into a specific campus tutoring website requiring the student to enter special access codes.

NetTutor assistance is of the "academic-assistance"&lt;ref name="Kersaint2011"/&gt; type. Conversations take place in a shared virtual whiteboard environment. In addition to providing for the free placement of text on the screen, the whiteboard is equipped with a toolbar for inserting math, chemistry, accounting, or English proofing symbols. Learners may submit their writing or questions for tutor review, or may choose an available live tutor and engage synchronous discussion. Learners may save or print out their live tutorial sessions, but live tutoring is exclusively one-on-one, so that the possible benefits of a discussion involving a group of peers (see, for instance, Jacques, et al., in ''Learning in Groups: A Handbook for on and off line environments'' (2007)) are not directly available.

This mode of access opens NetTutor to several criticisms, such as the accusation that tutors have an interest in exhausting the tutoring hours paid for, in order to get them to purchase more, or, on the other hand, that the tutor may rush the tutorial session by providing an answer to do more sessions and enable the learner to engage in [[academic dishonesty]]. NetTutor claims to have elaborate tutor vetting and training programs. In addition, LSI agrees upon detailed tutoring guidelines with representatives of its institutional clients. This differentiates NetTutor sharply from sites such as [[Student of Fortune]], the founder of which describes academic dishonesty in online tutoring as "something that is definitely going to happen.".&lt;ref name="SOFSource"/&gt;

Recent research published about NetTutor suggests that offering students the use of online tutoring as a resource in a traditional "brick-and-mortar" setting leads to an increase in student persistence and achievement.&lt;ref name="Kersaint2011"/&gt;

==Controversies surrounding online tutoring==

LSI, apparently in response to several controversies&lt;ref name="SOFSource"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Patrick"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IHE"/&gt; that surround the use of distance education and  online tutoring, has taken some measures to assure users of the academic value of NetTutor. The main issues are shown in the table below, with an explanation of each. LSI claims that NetTutor answers each concern, as shown. It can be seen that, even with these policies, there may be extensive [[Due diligence|due-diligence]] requirements, the responsibility for which may fall on the user of the service.

|Tutors may not be qualified to discuss questions learners ask.
|Internal qualifying exams, academic requirements, and a percentage of the tutoring staff hold doctorates in the areas they tutor.
|Individual qualifications of tutors may or may not be sufficient to guarantee adequate academic support in a given tutorial session.
|-
!scope=row text-align="center"|Tutor online communication skills 
|Online tutors need excellent and verifiable pedagogical and communication skills.
|Ongoing tutor training is conducted face-to-face and monitoring is constant, since all tutors work on the LSI premises.
|This approach assumes that LSI is able to hire adequate local talent.
|-
!scope="row" text-align="center"|Online tutoring reflection of course 
|Online tutor may not be committed to the learner’s goals&lt;ref name="Neville"/&gt;
|All goals, textbooks, and other resources are immediately accessible to tutors. 
|Tutors could possibly exhaust learners’ access time in looking up questions and resources.
|-
!scope="row" text-align="center"|Online pedagogy vs. academic dishonesty
|Online tutor may simply give answers or writing edits to students, rather than assist in the learning process.
|Specific guidelines are drawn up and shared with users; tutors are bound by these guidelines, and one requirement is that tutors assist learners rather than dispense answers.
|This needs to be a two-sided process; that is, educators must be able to criticize and revise guidelines to insure relevance to a specific topic or learning situation.
|-
!scope="row" text-align="center"|Education vendor vs. education professional
|Online tutor may simply be there, may elongate tutoring sessions, etc., to collect the learners’ money
|Tutors are background-checked and must be qualified educators with proven records of success at tutoring prior to hiring at LSI; records of tutorial sessions are available to the user upon demand.
|Educator or parent would verify that the dedication shown by NetTutor tutors to learners’ goals.
|-
!scope="row" text-align="center"|Technology learning curve
|Students may need assistance in using the NetTutor interface 
|There is a ''Customer Request'' link on the main NetTutor web pages; also, LSI has developed multiple technologies and hosting platforms and these have been tested for user-friendliness in various learning environments.
|Perhaps this is not as great a concern today as when NetTutor began, but educators and parents should acquaint themselves with LSI customer service and other LSI technologies to verify the company's claims.
|-
!scope="row" text-align="center"|Learner frustration with asynchronous tutoring
|Learner may use a non-live, ''asynchronous'' tutoring mode, expecting the "answer" in return. Instead, the tutor may respond with a clarifying or Socratic question, or may suggest further research on the learner's part.
|This is the pedagogically correct way to proceed; the learner has the choice of interacting with a live tutor and submitting questions for review.
|Learners need to be clear on what type of help they will receive; it may be up to educators or parents to assist with this.
|-
!scope="row" text-align="center"|Tutors assist learners, leaving teaching the course up to students' teachers
|Students seeking to get entire lessons or get just the answer to a single question will be referred to their textbooks or other learning resources. It seems inefficient to be asked about one is having difficulties, rather than being told what the answer is.
|The idea is to help students develop the answers on their own. Students' work is supported by providing necessary concepts to scaffold the construction of a solution. Asking where students are experiencing difficulty is more efficient than attempting to lecture. Tutors always respect and reinforce students' advancements.
|It is important to manage student expectations regarding tutoring. NetTutor seems consistent in leaving this up to the teacher. It is also important to make sure, though, that the tutor actually supports tutoring with the necessary concepts.

'''New College of Florida''' is a public [[liberal arts]] [[honors college]] in [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]], [[Florida]], [[United States]]. It was founded as a private institution and is now an autonomous college of the [[State University System of Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Fast Facts|publisher = New College of Florida |url = http://www.ncf.edu/fast-facts|accessdate = 2011-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New College of Florida |publisher=State University System of Florida |url=http://www.flbog.org/aboutsus/universities/ncf.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204183234/http://www.flbog.org/aboutsus/universities/ncf.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-02-04 |accessdate=2001-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It severed its ties with the [[University of South Florida]] in 2001 to become the eleventh independent school in the [[Florida State University System]] and adopted its current name: New College of Florida.  In 2015, ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' ranked New College as the fifth best value public liberal arts college in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report Announces the 2015 Best Colleges|url = https://www.usnews.com/info/blogs/press-room/2014/09/09/us-news-announces-the-2015-best-colleges|website = US News &amp; World Report|date = 2014-09-09|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
New College was conceived during the late 1950s, and founded in 1960 as a private college by local civic leaders for academically talented students. Financial assistance was provided by the Board of Homeland Missions of the [[United Church of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncf.edu/about/history.html A Brief History - New College of Florida, The public liberal arts honors college for the state of Florida&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620021736/http://www.ncf.edu/about/history.html |date=2008-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George F. Baughman]] served as the first president from 1961 to 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncf.edu/publicaffairs/documents/Baughman.htm NFC.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814153316/http://www.ncf.edu/PublicAffairs/Documents/Baughman.htm |date=2007-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school offers a liberal arts education in the [[Southern United States|South]] and incorporates the core values of freedom of inquiry and the responsibility of individual students for their own education were to be implemented through a unique academic program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last = Terte |first = Robert H. |title = New College due in Florida in '64; Privately Endowed School to Be Open to All Races |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |page = Page 21 |date = July 24, 1961 |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00611FF355B147A93C6AB178CD85F458685F9 |postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open to students of all races, genders, and religious affiliations, New College opened its doors in 1964 to a premier class of 101 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title = News Notes: Classroom and Campus  |newspaper = The New York Times |pages = Page E7 |date = March 1, 1964 |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10C16FD385B1B728DDDA80894DB405B848AF1D3 |postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whatisncf"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
Faculty members included the historian and philosopher, [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], who was lured out of retirement to join the charter faculty.

By 1972, New College's ranks had swelled to more than 500 students and it had become known for its teaching-focused faculty, its unique courses and curricula, and its fiercely independent and hard-working students. As the 1970s progressed, although New College's academic program continued to mature, inflation threatened to undermine the economic viability of the institution. By 1975, the college was $3.9 million in debt and on the brink of insolvency, and the [[University of South Florida]] (USF) expressed interest in buying the land and facilities of the near-bankrupt college to establish a branch campus for the [[Sarasota]] and [[Bradenton]] area.&lt;ref name="whatisncf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytncbankruptcy"&gt;{{Cite news |title =  Innovative Florida College Saved From Bankruptcy by Ex-Trustees |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |page = Page 28 |date = January 26, 1977 |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0914FD3B5B12718DDDAF0A94D9405B878BF1D3 |postscript =  &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an unusual agreement, the New College Board of Trustees agreed to hand over the school's campus and other assets to the state, at the time valued at $8.5 million, in exchange for the state paying off its debts and agreeing to continue to operate the school as a separate unit within the USF. The agreement stated that New College was to receive the same funding, per-student, as other programs at USF. The former New College Board of Trustees became the New College Foundation, and was required to raise money privately to supplement the state funds to reach the total necessary to run New College, at the time about a third of New College's $2-million-a-year operating budget. Under the agreement, New College was re-christened the "New College of the University of South Florida". USF started a Sarasota branch program that shared the bay front campus, and the schools began an uneasy relationship that would last for the next twenty-five years, with New College and the University of South Florida through its [[University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee|Sarasota branch program]] sharing the campus.&lt;ref name="whatisncf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytncbankruptcy"/&gt;

As part of a major reorganization of Florida's public education system in 2001, New College severed its ties with USF, became the eleventh independent school in the [[State University System of Florida|Florida State University System]], and adopted its current name, New College of Florida.&lt;ref&gt;

Today, as Florida's independent honors college, New College retains its original academic program, while enjoying the benefits and accessibility that being a public university affords. It is a member of the [[Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges]].

New College is governed by a 12-member Board of Trustees, who serve staggered four-year terms.  Of the 12 members, three must be residents of [[Sarasota County, Florida|Sarasota County]] and two must be residents of [[Manatee County, Florida|Manatee County]].&lt;ref&gt;Florida Statutes 1004.32(3)(a) and (b).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Palmcourt.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Seen here in a photograph from 2003, Palm Court is located in the Pei Residence hall complex and is the center of New College student life]] --&gt;
New College's {{convert|144|acre|km2|adj=on}} bay front campus is located in west [[Sarasota]], [[Florida]], approximately fifty miles to the south of [[Tampa]]. Situated between [[Sarasota Bay]] and the [[Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport]], the college lies within a public educational, cultural, and historic district that includes the [[John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art]] and the [[Asolo Repertory Theatre]]. The primary campus is located on the former [[Charles Ringling|Edith and Charles Ringling]] estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncf.edu/catalog/TheCampusAndFacilities.htm|title=New College - The Campus and Facilities|publisher=|accessdate=5 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903175846/http://www.ncf.edu/catalog/TheCampusAndFacilities.htm|archive-date=2006-09-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campus also includes portions of The Uplands, a residential neighborhood that is bounded by the historic bay front campus to the south, [[Tamiami Trail]] to the east, [[Sarasota Bay]] to the west, most of which used to be a portion of the estate, and the [[Powel Crosley Jr#Seagate in Florida|Seagate]] property to the north.

The campus's most remarkable structures are its three Florida 1920s [[Florida land boom of the 1920s|boom time]], grand-scale residences, the former home of [[Charles Ringling|Edith and Charles Ringling]] (today called ''College Hall''), the former home of [[Charles Ringling|Hester Ringling Lancaster Sanford]] (today called ''Cook Hall''), and the former home of [[Sarasota, Florida#Historic sites in Sarasota|Ellen and Ralph Caples]] (today called ''Caples Hall''). The well-appointed structures date from the early to mid-1920s, are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and are similar in style to the adjacent [[John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art]] and their residence, [[John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art|Cà d'Zan]]. Today, these gracious homes are used as classrooms, meeting rooms, and offices and their expansive properties provide sites for the modern developments on the bay front campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncf.edu/novak/gweb1/Archives/Ringling/ringling.htm NCF .edu&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911094639/http://www.ncf.edu/novak/gweb1/Archives/Ringling/ringling.htm |date=2006-09-11 }}, Ringling&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus is also home to several examples of high modernist architecture designed by [[I. M. Pei]]. These buildings include a complex of student residences known as "Pei", a cafeteria, and a student center. The other dormitories are Dort, Goldstein, and Palmer B. Five new dormitory buildings have been opened in the 2007–2008 school year, with the most recent opened in October 2007.  They currently are referred to as V, W, X, Y, and Z.  For most of the buildings naming donors have not been set in stone completely, but the largest building, "Z" has been named by the Pritzker family. They have donated several times to the college, including a library reading room and the Marine Sciences building; "X" recently was named in honor of Ulla R. Searing.

[[File:JaneBancroftCookLibrary.jpg|thumb|The Jane Bancroft Cook Library taken from under the bell tower.

In 2005, a long range campus master plan was developed through public workshops held by the design teams from the Folsom Group of Sarasota, [[Moule &amp; Polyzoides]] of Pasadena, California, Harper Aiken Partners of St. Petersburg, Florida, Biohabitats Inc. of Canton, Georgia, and Hall Planning and Engineering of Tallahassee, Florida. Extensive participation by the students, faculty, administration, residents of the community, and staff members of local governmental agencies was a major feature of the workshops. The husband and wife architectural firm includes Liz Moule and Stefanos Polyzoides,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mparchitects.com/bios/stefanos.html|title=Biography of Stefanos Polyziodes|publisher=|accessdate=5 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714122314/http://www.mparchitects.com/bios/stefanos.html|archive-date=2011-07-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-founder of the [[Congress for the New Urbanism]].

The most recent addition to campus is the Academic Center and the adjacent Robert and Beverly Koski Academic Plaza. The Academic Center was awarded Gold [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certification in the fall of 2011 for a number of sustainable features: 
* Toilets flush using residual rainwater from the roof and A/C condensate.
* Specially designed tanks built-in under the adjoining Koski Plaza collect storm water.
* Special CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; room sensors measure air quality and adjust the A/C system accordingly.
* High-efficiency windows let in natural light.
* Pavers and high reflective roofing materials reflect sunshine.
* More than 85 percent of construction site debris was recycled.

==Academics==

===Program features===
Four core principles form the base of New College's academic philosophy: (1) each student is responsible in the last analysis for his or her own education, (2) the best education demands a joint search for learning by exciting teachers and able students, (3) students' progress should be based on demonstrated competence and real mastery rather than on the accumulation of credits and grades, (4) students should have, from the outset, opportunities to explore in-depth, areas of interest to them. To the end of putting this philosophy into practice, New College uses a unique academic program that differs substantially from those of most other educational institutions in four key ways:&lt;ref name = "NCFAcademics"&gt;
{{cite web |title = The New College Academic Program |publisher = New College of Florida |url = http://www.ncf.edu/catalog/index.html |accessdate = 2007-03-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070219074203/http://www.ncf.edu/catalog/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-19}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Narrative evaluation]]s''': at the completion of each course, students receive an evaluation written by the instructor critiquing their performance and course work, along with a satisfactory, unsatisfactory, or incomplete designation. [[Grading in the United States|Letter grades]] and [[Grading in the United States#Grade point average|grade-point-averages]] are not used at New College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* '''Contract System''': at the start of each semester, students negotiate a contract with their faculty adviser, specifying their courses of study and expectations for the semester.  At the completion of the term, the academic adviser compares the student's performance with the requirements defined in the contract, and determines whether the student has "passed" the contract, or not. Among other requirements, completing seven contracts is a prerequisite to graduation by the college.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Independent Study Projects''': the month of January is reserved for independent projects at New College, a period when no traditional courses are held. Independent Study Projects run the gamut from short, in-depth, academic research projects to internships, lab work, and international exchanges. Students are required to complete three independent study projects prior to being graduated.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Senior Thesis''': each student is required to write an original and lengthy thesis in their discipline, and to defend it before a committee of at least three faculty members. Depending on the area of concentration of each student, a senior thesis may take the form of an original research paper, performing and documenting a scientific or social-scientific experiment or research study, or an original composition. This requirement usually is completed during the final two semesters of a student's fourth year.&lt;ref&gt;Interested parties may search the thesis through New College of Florida's [http://purl.fcla.edu/ncf/ncfdigital Digital Repository].

&lt;/ref&gt;
The academic structure described above is implemented through classes and research projects in a diverse array of subjects in the humanities, social sciences, and the natural sciences.  With a little over 800 students, an average class size of eighteen and a student to faculty ratio of 10 to 1, the academic environment is small and intimate and known for its intellectual intensity.&lt;ref name="NCFAcademics"/&gt;

In 2017, New College was ranked tied 90th in the national liberal arts college category by [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]].

In 2015 New College of Florida failed to qualify for a share of a $100M pool of state educational funds after scoring third lowest statewide among Florida colleges and junior colleges on a career issue-focused rating metric.  One year post-graduation, only 44% of New College graduates were working or pursuing their education full-time, by far the lowest in the Florida college system.  Median wages for New College graduates employed full-time in Florida one year post-graduation was $21,200, vs over $30,000 for every other university in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20140528/ARTICLE/140529679?p=2&amp;tc=pg |title=New College receives poor grade from Florida &amp;#124; HeraldTribune.com |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
Art conservation research study conducted by [[physicist]]s Mariana Sendova, Valentin Zhelyaskov, and recent alumnus Matthew Ramsey at New College, and the chief conservator at the [[John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art]], Michelle Scalera, marked the inauguration of formal collaborations between the long-time neighboring institutions on Bay Shore Road.  The collaboration is funded by Dr. Sendova's research grant from the [[U.S. Department of Education]] to establish an on-campus High-Resolution Raman Spectrography laboratory for the non-destructive analysis of rare objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ringling.org/about_museum_news2.asp?id=127|title=Ringling.org|publisher=|accessdate=5 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024074709/http://www.ringling.org/about_museum_news2.asp?id=127|archive-date=2007-10-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, New College has been working with [[Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute]]. LRRI and NCF have established a joint bio-informatics partnership to provide faculty and their students research opportunities in the emerging fields of systems biology, bio-informatics and computational biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncf.edu/natural-sciences/bioinformatics|title=NCF.edu|publisher=|accessdate=5 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401225743/http://www.ncf.edu/natural-sciences/bioinformatics|archive-date=2009-04-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==

===New College Student Alliance===
The New College Student Alliance (NCSA) is New College's student government organization. Many decisions relating to student and campus events, academic decisions and policies, the allocation of funds, and recently, the revision of the campus master plan, and the building of new dorm complexes are influenced by the opinions of the student body via the NSCA.  "Towne Meetings", held monthly in Palm Court, are the main forum for public debate and are open to all students, faculty, and staff.

The NCSA Constitution states that the purpose of Towne Meetings is "to inform the student body of the actions of the NCSA, to gather opinions and ideas from the students on matters of concern to the College community, to propose and enact informed legislation, and to confirm Presidential appointments to NCSA positions as necessary." Students are welcome to make announcements and address the community with important issues at this forum, and they may call for motions on the issues they present. Typical Towne Meetings consist of 60 to 200 students, with 50 being quorum.

The NCSA constitution also is known for articulating the whimsical nature of the student body.  For example, article ten (officially known as Article 9 3/4) states that:
{{Quote|&lt;poem&gt;The New College Student Alliance shall embrace the following symbols:
{{in5}}a) [ ] (The Null Set) as Mascot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=New College Student Alliance|title=The Constitution of the New College Student Alliance|publisher=New College of Florida|pages=xv|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0vII2KR5vgWdkc2aExRbXNhbmc/edit|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{in5}}b) Palm Court as the Center of the Universe
{{in5}}c) Our Motto: "There is more to running a starship than answering a bunch of damn fool questions"
{{in5}}d) Our Mission: "That the natural state of the human spirit is ecstatic wonder!

The NCSA cabinet consists of a President or two Co-Presidents, a Chief of Staff, a Vice President of Student Affairs, a Vice President of Relations and Financial Affairs, a Vice President of Academic Affairs, a Vice President of Green Affairs (also known as Captain Planet), a Vice President of Diversity and Inclusivity, and an Executive Secretary.

==Student politics==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
{{POV|date=November 2017}}
New College students are generally politically progressive.  Over the years students have taken part in a number of local, regional and national protests and demonstrations.

On May 2, 1988, hundreds of students were present and 43 were arrested as bulldozers were brought in to demolish a grove of trees which had been part of the campus culture since the founding of the school. The term "the Grove," referred to a rather remote stand of about 200 oak, pine and palm trees on the East side of campus where students used to gather from time to time. It provided a buffer between New College and the Sarasota Bradenton International Airport (which owns the land New College occupies on the East side of US-41) and offered a sort of "wilderness" area which students would use for various purposes. Numerous parties, bonfires, romantic interludes, Wiccan ceremonies, etc. would occur there.

The Sarasota Manatee Airport Authority, as a part of their expansion, wanted to build a new exit road out of the airport which would go right through the Grove. Students on campus mobilized in defense of their campus. The New College Student Alliance and their legal team tried to work with the New College and USF administration and the Airport authority to reroute the road and avoid destroying the Grove.  While initially cooperative, the Airport Authority ultimately ignored the legal challenges students had filed against the construction and one morning showed up with bulldozers, a logging crew, and dozens of police officers to clear the Grove, arrest the students, and take them to jail.

Hundreds of New College students observed the event, and many took part protesting the demolition of the Grove by occupying the space, getting in front of the machinery, and generally creating a nuisance. While some of the 43 students who were arrested complained of police mistreatment, charges against all the students were dropped by the end of the day.

Eric Shickler, now a political science professor at UC Berkeley, articulated the student perspective. In a letter to'' Sarasota-Herald'', on April 18, 1988, Shickler argued it was wrong "to portray the students' interest as minor and only a matter of 'trees.'" He went on to say: "What is at stake here is the quality of life for the students who use the East Campus of New College, including interference with a $1.2 million capital improvement project, the Student Center Complex, which will be operated and maintained by student funds."  He continued: "Also at issue is the airport authority's heavy-handed refusal to give any consideration to its neighbors, even when presented with reasonable, responsible and feasible alternatives to preserve the public interest."

Many students were traumatized by the events, and some did not return to school in the fall. The incident further alienated the USF administration from the New College student body, feeding sentiments which would lead to New College's eventual independence.  Other reactions to the Grove Protest were more positive and involved planting hundreds of trees all over campus which are still thriving today.

==Alumni==
{{see also|List of New College of Florida alumni}}
Most alumni live in [[Florida]], but large clusters of alums gravitate to [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], [[Manhattan]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Atlanta]], and [[Boston]].

New College graduates are relatively few (about 4,000), although everyone who has attended the college for more than one semester, regardless of graduation status, is considered a New College alumnus. They are dated by the year they entered New College, not by graduation year. For example, a student entering New College in 1985 would be considered part of the "Class of 1985." Among these should be counted [[Mark Weiser]], visionary Xerox PARC computer scientist, who conceived of the approach to evolving computer interfaces known as "ubiquitous computing." Weiser attended New College from 1970 through 1974, continuing his education at the University of Michigan (Masters 1977, PhD. 1979).

Among the most prominent New College graduates are president of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] [[William C. Dudley|William Dudley]]; Ambassador [[Nancy McEldowney]]; Law Professor [[Anita L. Allen]], named to the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues; Mathematician and [[Fields medal|Fields Medalist]] [[William Thurston]]; [[Jennifer Granick]] Attorney, Director of Civil Liberties, [[Stanford Center for Internet and Society]] and former Civil Liberties Director, [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]; bestselling author of ''Getting Things Done'' [[David Allen (author)]]; civic leader and environmental researcher [[Jono Miller]]; national [[Telemundo]] anchor [[Jose Diaz-Balart]]; founder of the [[Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies]] [[Rick Doblin]];  Emmy-award-winning TV writer/producer [[Carol Flint]]; former U.S. Representative [[Lincoln Diaz-Balart]]; CEO of Barnie's Coffee &amp; Tea Jonathan Smiga; [[David M.

In 2010 [[Manayunk, Philadelphia|Manayunk]] resident and Philadelphia School District teacher Keith Newman criticized the school district's handling of the high school, stating that it should not be ranked as "persistently dangerous" since it is in a relatively well-to-do area.

Roxborough alumnus Stephen Brandt made efforts to turn around the school during his time as principal. The school district had asked him, previously a [[Norristown School District]] employee, to help improve the high school. He received the 2013 Lindback Award for Distinguished Principal Leadership. In 2013 Brandt, then the outgoing principal, stated that Dana Jenkins was going to be the new principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Scally, Bernard J.|url=http://www.montgomerynews.com/articles/2013/06/14/roxborough_review/news/doc51b745e5a0979592908489.txt|title=New principal named for Roxborough High|publisher=''[[Roxborough Review]]''|date=2013-06-14|accessdate=2016-11-16}} ([https://www.webcitation.org/6m40YiyNV?url=http://www.montgomerynews.com/articles/2013/06/14/roxborough_review/news/doc51b745e5a0979592908489.txt?viewmode=fullstory Archive])&lt;/ref&gt;

The SCALE-UP name originally stood for “Student-Centered Activities for Large Enrollment Undergraduate Physics” but since its conception many different institutions have begun teaching a variety of courses of various sizes. The acronym was changed to “Student-Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs.” Now, because of the increasing number of pre-college installations, plus to draw attention to the instruction as well as the space, the name has become "Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies." The basic idea is that students are given something interesting to investigate. While they work in teams on these "tangibles" (hands-on measurements or observations) and "ponderables" (interesting, complex problems), the instructor is free to roam around the classroom–--asking questions, sending one team to help another, or asking why someone else got a different answer. There is no separate lab class and most of the "lectures" are actually class-wide discussions. The groups are carefully structured and give students many opportunities to interact. Three teams (labelled a, b, and c) sit at each round table and have white boards nearby. Each team has a laptop in case they need web access. The [http://scaleup.ncsu.edu/groups/adopters/wiki/056a1/North_Carolina_State_Physics.html  original design] called for 11 round tables of nine students, but many schools have smaller classes while a few have even larger ones. Smaller classes, particularly those in high schools, have also been using D-shaped tables that seat six students.

'''Seductive details''' are often used in textbooks, lectures, slideshows, and other forms of educational content to make a course more interesting or interactive. Seductive details can take the form of text, photos, illustrations, sounds or music and are by definition: (1) interesting and (2) not directed toward the learning objectives of a lesson.&lt;ref name=park1 /&gt;  [[John Dewey]], in 1913, first referred to this as “fictitious inducements to attention.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dewey|first1=J.|title=Interest and Effort in Education|date=1913|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|location=Boston|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; While illustrated text can enhance comprehension, illustrations that are not relevant can lead to poor [[Educational aims and objectives#Learning outcomes|learning outcomes]].&lt;ref name=sanchez&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanchez|first1=C.

Recently, there have been many criticisms of this theory. Critics cite unconvincing and contradictory evidence to argue that seductive details do not always impede understanding and that seductive details can sometimes be motivating for learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goetz|first1=E.

== The research ==
[[File:Carbon sequestration-2009-10-07.svg|thumb|Example of an image that is relevant to the topic of carbon sequestration.]] [[File:Centrale Saint-Denis.jpg|thumb|Example of a seductive detail. This image of a fossil-fuel power plant is tangentially related to carbon sequestration.]] Most studies are conducted through experiments that compare the learning results between two scenarios: an explanation with seductive details and an explanation with no seductive details. The explanation format can vary in form from text-based, video, web-based or presentation style. The seductive details in these experiments varies from extraneous details to irrelevant images or irrelevant video. Learning outcomes of participants are determined through a variety of tests that include both recall abilities and problem-solving abilities. This is known as transfer performance.

Early research showed that adding seductive details did not have the intended effect of improving learning; instead the seductive details tended to be detrimental to the learner's recall. Adding interesting but unimportant sentences to expository texts hindered the learning of the main points of the text and learners would remember the seductive details better than the main text.

An example of a seductive detail in a training context might be a training class that includes cartoons on slides containing tips for effective supervision. Although not necessarily relevant to the topic, the cartoons are designed to make the training material more interesting, but the results of multiple studies suggest that their inclusion will harm recall from the primary training content.

Harp and [[Richard E. Mayer|Mayer]]&lt;ref name=harp&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harp|first1=S.|last2=Mayer|first2=R.|title=How seductive details do their damage: A theory of cognitive interest in science learning|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=1998|volume=90|issue=3|pages=414–434|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.90.3.414}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted an experiment using a lesson about lightning strikes. The effect of lightning strikes on airplanes was added as a seductive detail. In six out of six experiments, learners who studied the base lesson without the seductive details about the strikes on airplanes demonstrated they were three times more likely to recall the structurally important details. They also performed much better on a problem-solving task than learners whose lessons included the seductive details. Harper and Mayer suggested seductive details do their damage when learners are consolidating and organizing new information by forming knowledge structures ill-suited for later recall.&lt;ref name=harp /&gt;

== The psychology ==
Researchers focus on various aspects of [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive theory]] to explain the seductive details effect. Seductive details impose an extraneous cognitive load during learning by enticing students to spend their limited resources in processing materials that distract from, or disrupt, the construction of a coherent [[mental model]] in the learning process. Most studies use seductive details in science text to demonstrate the extraneous cognitive load. However, there are contrasting studies done with non-scientific texts that did not produce the same results. These results may suggest that seductive details can only interfere with learning within a high load learning process that requires managing the available cognitive resources. In learning situations that are associated with low [[working memory]] activity, seductive details did not have a detrimental effect. They can even lead to higher performance because there are the required cognitive resources available for the motivating function.&lt;ref name=park1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=B.|last2=Moreno|first2=R.|last3=Seufert|first3=T.|last4=Bruken|first4=R.|title=Does cognitive load moderate the seductive details effect? A multimedia study|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=January 2011|volume=27|issue=1|pages=5–10|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.05.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metacognition ===
Jaeger and Wiley, in 2015, looked at readers' ability to monitor their own comprehension. Their study used a science text as the base of a lesson and decorative images as the seductive details. They found that readers were less able to monitor their own comprehension of the text when the text was sprinkled with decorative images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=A.|last2=Wiley|first2=J.|title=Do illustrations help or harm metacomprehension accuracy?|journal=Learning &amp; Instruction|date=Dec 2014|volume=34|pages=58–73|doi=10.1016/j.learninstruc.2014.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activating inappropriate prior knowledge ===
A 1998 study by Harp and Mayer determined that it was likely that the seductive details effect created an inappropriate diversion for the learner "by activating an inappropriate base of prior knowledge in the learner". Further, they found that when seductive details were placed at the beginning of a lesson, a learner's performance would be particularly hindered. However, when seductive details were put at the end of a lesson, a student's performance was similar to a student who had not experienced seductive details in their lesson.&lt;ref name=harp /&gt;

=== Strain on working memory ===
A study by Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor learning outcomes because they take up some of the limited space in [[working memory]]. The experiment compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low working memory capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low working memory looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working memory capacity.&lt;ref name=sanchez /&gt; It could be argued that differences in performance between high- and low- working memory capacity individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with working memory capacity in other studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daneman|first1=M.|last2=Carpenter|first2=P. A.|title=Individual differences in working memory and reading|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning &amp; Verbal Behavior|date=1980|volume=19|pages=450–466|doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(80)90312-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This vulnerability as it relates to low working memory capacity individuals and seductive details within textual information can also be seen as a difference between children and adult learners. Because adults, on average, having a higher working memory capacity than children, adults are less affected by seductive details than children.&lt;ref name=garner /&gt;

=== Transfer of learning ===
The seductive details effect has primarily been demonstrated at the point of [[knowledge acquisition]] (initial learning); its impact on transfer performance has not been clearly shown. Theory in text comprehension suggests that seductive details might be detrimental for recall but advantageous for transfer performance because of the schematic representation of information that trainees form during instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=van Dijk|first1=T. A.|last2=Kintsch|first2=W.|title=Strategies of discourse comprehension|date=1983|publisher=Academic|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have described the seductive details effect as having a damaging effect on recall because it distracts trainees from learning and they tend to form inappropriate schemas to organize information.&lt;ref name=harp /&gt; However, when learners are applying knowledge, [[Empirical research|empirical studies]] suggest that the distortion of the macro structure or schema of the instructional material is beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mannes|first1=S.|last2=Kintsch|first2=W.|title=Knowledge organization and text organization|journal=Cognition and Instruction|date=1987|volume=4|pages=91–115|doi=10.1207/s1532690xci0402_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNamara|first1=D. S.|last2=Kintsch|first2=W.|last3=Songer|first3=N. B.|title=Are good texts always better? Interactions of text coherence, background knowledge, and levels of understanding in learning from text|journal=Cognition and Instruction|date=1996|volume=14|pages=1–43|doi=10.1207/s1532690xci1401_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study, students who read less-organized material performed better that students given organized material on tasks that required an application of the knowledge to problem-solving. This suggests that the inclusion of seductive details might be beneficial for transfer performance but detrimental when trainees are recalling information. Interference from seductive details creates confusion of what the core material is and, therefore, the recall will not be as good and more errors will occur. This distortion can lead to a richer understanding of the material and facilitate transfer performance because trainees are required to form a macro structure of the instructional material. Research using the dual-coding paradigm also suggests that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and leads to deeper processing of information because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems.&lt;ref name=paivio&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paivio|first1=A|title=Mental representations: A dual coding approach.|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sadoski2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadoski|first1=M|last2=Goetz|first2=E. T.|last3=Fritz|first3=J. B.|title=Impact of concreteness, interest, and memory for text implications for dual coding theory and text design.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=1993|volume=85|pages=291–304|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.85.2.291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sadoski1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadoski|first1=M|last2=Goetz|first2=E. T.|last3=Rodriguez|first3=M.|title=Engaging texts: Effects of concreteness on comprehensibility, interest, and recall in four text types|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=2000|volume=92|pages=85–95|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.92.1.85}}&lt;/ref&gt; When information is made easier to comprehend, material is processed less deeply, thus leading to poorer acquisition of information.

== Criticisms ==
Classic learning theories and the modern [[dual-coding theory]] support the introduction of interesting, tangential details to learning content. There is evidence that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and is better remembered because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems.&lt;ref name=paivio /&gt;&lt;ref name=sadoski2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sadoski1 /&gt; This suggests that interesting material, even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting material.&lt;ref name=paivio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadoski|first1=M.|last2=Paivio|first2=A.|title=Imagery and text: A dual coding theory of reading and writing|journal=Reading and Writing|date=2001|volume=16|pages=259–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayer|first1=R. E.|last2=Anderson|first2=R. B.|title=Animations need narrations: An experimental test of a dual-coding hypothesis|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=1991|volume=83|pages=484–490|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.83.4.484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several recent studies have shown that adding seductive details does not have a significant impact on learner outcomes. Park et al. (2011)&lt;ref name=park1 /&gt; looked at cognitive load theory to explain these controversial results. The experiment asked high school students to learn about biology using a multimedia environment (one with seductive details and one without). The experiment also varied the cognitive load for the students. The results showed that students performed significantly higher when seductive details were present in a low cognitive load environment as compared with all other conditions.&lt;ref name=park1 /&gt; Another study by Park et al. (2015) showed that while seductive details were detrimental to learning in high cognitive load text conditions, seductive details actually improved motivation and learning outcomes in narration conditions where the cognitive load was low. This means that slideshows or webcasts with well-prepared narration that use motivating bits of information increase learner motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=B.|last2=Flowerday|first2=T.|last3=Brunken|first3=R.|title=Cognitive and affective effects of seductive details in multimedia learning|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=March 2015|volume=44|pages=267–278|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.10.061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia''' ('''SPM'''), or the '''Malaysian Certificate of Education''', is a national examination taken by all [[Education in Malaysia#Secondary education|fifth-form]] secondary school students in [[Malaysia]]. It is the equivalent to the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland;
[[Scottish Qualifications Authority#Qualification types|Nationals 4/5]] in Scotland; and [[GCE Ordinary Level]] in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It is the leaving examination of the [[eleventh grade]] of schooling.

SPM is the penultimate examination sat by secondary school students before entry into [[sixth form]] or [[vocational education|technical education]]. The examination is set and examined by the Malaysian Examinations Syndicate (''Lembaga Peperiksaan Malaysia'').

==History==
The SPM is equivalent to the British [[GCSE]], and provides the opportunity for Malaysians to continue their studies to pre-university level. Up to 1978, the examination was handled by [[UCLES]], which still advises the Malaysian Examinations Syndicate on standards. The English paper is separately graded by the national examination board and [[UCLES]], and both grades will be displayed on the statement slip. On the actual certificate, only the national examination board's grade is listed. The minimum requirements to obtain the certificate is to pass both Malay language and History.

Generally, the SPM is taken at the age of 17, though students who attended pre-secondary school class would take it at the age of 18. Previously, students who successfully passed their [[Education in Malaysia#Primary|Penilaian Tahap Satu]] (PTS) examination at Primary Three and chose to skip a year of primary school education would take their SPM a year earlier, at the age of 16. This was discontinued in 2000. Students who are [[homeschooling|home schooled]] generally take the SPM at the end of their secondary education as well.

In 2003, the medium of instruction for the science and mathematics subjects was [[Pengajaran dan Pembelajaran Sains dan Matematik Dalam Bahasa Inggeris|switched]] from [[Malay language|Malay]] to English. Due to this transition, students taking science and mathematics subjects can choose to respond in the examinations in either English or Malay. The Ministry of Education has since announced a reversal of this policy, set to take effect in 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/108156|title=PPSMI: Dr Mahathir minta undian pembaca blog|publisher=Malaysiakini.com|date=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
The evaluation scheme is fully exam-based. The examination for SPM usually takes place around November and lasts for more than 3 weeks. Papers are also scheduled in June for students who wish to resit for examinations they failed the previous year, but only for the compulsory subjects.

When releasing the results, only the letter grades (and not the actual scores) are made known to the candidates. Candidates may request a remarking (regrading) if they suspect errors in the original marking. Although no list of rankings is released to the public, the names of the top ranked students in the country and in each state are released to the press. These students may achieve the level of temporary celebrities, and may even be approached by companies to advertise their products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/education/story.asp?file=/2006/5/7/education/14157316 Stamp of approval]&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians usually visit some of these top ranked students a day before the official results to congratulate them. Because the SPM examination is the final nationally standardised examination taken by the majority of Malaysians, many scholarships are awarded based on SPM results.

Since 2010, however, the Ministry of Education has imposed a 10-subject limit on every candidate, while lowering the minimum number of subjects from 8 to 6. Students are allowed to take 2 additional subjects (comprising [[Arabic language|Arabic]], Chinese, [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Iban language|Iban]], [[Coastal Kadazan language|Kadazandusun]] languages and [[Biblical studies|Bible Knowledge]]) but they will not be taken into consideration for government scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/12/25/nation/5368219&amp;sec=nation |title=Languages and Bible Knowledge as electives |newspaper=[[The Star Online]] |date=25 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to year 2011, the Public Service Department (JPA) scholarships are given to students who scored excellent results in the SPM examination for their studies in universities. However, at June 2011, the Public Service Department announced that starting from the year 2012 onwards they will no longer offer scholarships to SPM leavers, instead they will only offer scholarships to leavers of STPM and A-Level. Later, at 23 March 2012, the Ministry of Education of Malaysia announced that starting from the SPM 2011 batch onwards, students who obtained 9A+ or above in the SPM are eligible for bursaries given by the ministry which will cover costs for pre-university programmes such as A-Level, International Baccalaureate, etc. 
In addition, the top-50 SPM candidates in the whole country can still be offered the Public Service Department scholarships based on National Scholarship Programme.

==Grade system==
Candidates are assigned [[Grade (education)|grades]] based on their scores in each subject. The exact grading scale used every year has never been made public.

Since 2009, grading system used has a range from A+ (the highest grade) to G (for "''gagal''" or fail; F is not used). The previous system assigned a grade point and a letter to each range, with 1A ("1" being the grade point and "A" the letter grade) as highest range and 9G the lowest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moe.gov.my/cms/upload_files/circularfile/2009/circularfile_file_000489.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Haitian Project, Inc.''' is a [[Providence, Rhode Island]] based [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] non-profit organization dedicated to education in Haiti. Since 1987, it has operated [[Louverture Cleary School]], a Catholic secondary school in Croix des Bouquets, Haiti. Patrick Moynihan, brother of [[Bank of America]] CEO [[Brian Moynihan]], is the President of The Haitian Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704762904575025382061100568/|title=After Quake, a Lesson in Persistence|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=20 September 2011 | first=Mike | last=Esterl | date=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brownalumnimagazine.com/content/view/2575/32/|title=The Brothers Moynihan|publisher=Brown Alumni Magazine|accessdate=21 September 2011 | first=Beth | last=Schwartzapfel | date=May–June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==

The Haitian Project through its support of [[Louverture Cleary School]], a national network of tuition-free, Catholic, co-educational secondary boarding schools in Haiti, provides for the education of academically talented and motivated students from Haitian families who cannot afford the cost of their children's education in order to maximize their potential and enable them to work toward building a Haiti where justice and peace thrive.

== History ==

The Haitian Project was founded in the early 1980s by a group of parishioners from St. Joseph's Parish in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1987, The Haitian Project established [[Louverture Cleary School]], a Catholic boarding school in Croix des Bouquets, Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brownalumnimagazine.com/content/view/2575/32/|title=The Brothers Moynihan|publisher=Brown Alumni Magazine|accessdate=21 September 2011 | first=Beth | last=Schwartzapfel | date=May–June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; St. Joseph's parishioner and current [[Bank of America]] CEO, [[Brian Moynihan]], was an early supporter of the school and his involvement inspired his younger brother, Patrick Moynihan, to go to Haiti and join The Haitian Project in 1996. In the late 1990s, The Haitian Project became a national project supported by individuals and parishes in five regions around the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/02/09/ex_traders_vision_keeps_schools_mission_clear/?page=full/|title=A Learning Oasis Buoyed by a Convert's Vision: Amid Haiti's devastation, Patrick Moynihan Presses on|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=20 September 2011 | first=Brian | last=MacQuarrie | date=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Patrick, formerly a commodities trader for [[Louis Dreyfus Group|Louis Dreyfus Commodities]], has been the President since 1996, with a two and half year hiatus from July 2006 to January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,673845-3,00.html|title=The Moses of Haiti, Bringing Aid to a Shattered Island|publisher=Der Spiegel|accessdate=21 September 2011 | first=Klaus | last=Brinkbäumer | date=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current activities ==

Over 350 secondary students attend the tuition-free boarding school, with a majority attending universities in Haiti upon graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://magazine.nd.edu/news/10285/|title=A Gift of Hope|publisher=Notre Dame Magazine|accessdate=20 September 2011 | first=Walt | last=Collins | date=Autumn 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motto of the school is biblical, from Matthew 10:8: "What you receive for free, you must give for free." Consequently, students are expected to give freely to Haiti what they have received for free.

[[Bishop Ireton High School]] in Alexandria, Virginia is the sister school of [[Louverture Cleary School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bishopireton.org/page.aspx?pid=568|title=Video About Bishop Ireton's Haitian Sister School – Louverture Cleary|publisher=Bishop Ireton High School|accessdate=17 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610153945/http://www.bishopireton.org/page.aspx?pid=568|archivedate=10 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Universidad Laboral de Gijón''' is located in [[Gijón]] ([[Asturias]], [[Spain]]) specifically in the parish of [[Cabueñes]].

==History==
Built between 1946 and 1955, it is the most important architectural work built in the 20th century in Asturias and is considered, with its 270,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the biggest building in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elcomercio.es/v/20101013/gijon/anos-como-vigia-gijon-20101013.html 55 años como vigía de Gijón]; ''[[El Comercio (Spain)|El Comercio]]'', 13 October 2010 {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 2016 the Universidad Laboral was declared [[Bien de Interés Cultural]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lne.es/asturias/2016/05/19/universidad-laboral-interes-cultural-bic/1929242.html|date=19 May 2016|accessdate=12 July 2016|language=es|title=La Universidad Laboral, Bien de Interés Cultural (BIC)|publisher=[[La Nueva España]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2016-6689|publisher=''[[Boletín Oficial del Estado]]''|date=12 July 2016|accessdate=12 July 2016|language=es|title=Decreto 19/2016, de 19 de mayo, por el que se declara bien de interés cultural, con la categoría de monumento, la Universidad Laboral de Gijón.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The building==
[[File:Universidad Laboral de Gijón. Torre.jpg|thumb|The tower of the Universidad Laboral]]
[[File:U Laboral Gijon 01.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the courtyard]]
Luis Moya, who designed the ensemble along the lines of the Parthenon, chose to have the main gate face away from the city, so that visitors coming from Gijón would have to walk around the university before entering, and therefore fully admire its magnificence.

===Door===
The door is located in the main facade, an arch with a shaped tower. Above the arch is a shield with the eagle of Saint John and the yoke and arrows of the [[Catholic Monarchs]] with two angels holding it.

===Courtyard===
The courtyard is roofless with an area of 150×150 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. All of the building is structured around the courtyard.

===Church===

The church is the most spectacular building in the Universidad Laboral. With a surface area of 807 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it is the biggest church with an elliptical floor in the world.

Outside, there is a figure of the Virgin of Covadonga with Corinthian columns sustaining the statues of St. Joseph, St. Peter, St. Paul and St. Ignatius. Above them all, St. James on horse with two angels sustains the [[Victory Cross]], the coat of arms of Asturias.

The church has a 2,300-ton dome. The height between the floor and the highest point of the dome is 32 m. In the construction of the church about 450,000 bricks were used. The floor is made entirely of [[marble]] and the benches, for more than one thousand people, of a special wood from [[Equatorial Guinea]]. The original benches were cut exclusively for this church and each was made in one piece. Today, the benches are not in the church.

The church is unconsecrated and has no Catholic icon. It is currently used to host art exhibitions.

===Theater===
The theater has a Hellenic style facade and similar dimensions to the [[Parthenon]]. Above the central [[pediment]] there is a big [[coat of arms of Spain]] following the model of 1945.

The capacity of the theater is about 1,500. It was the first totally air-conditioned theater, using an underground system of air distribution.

The [[Frontispiece (architecture)|frontispiece]] was decorated with a 120-m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; fresco of [[Enrique Segura]]. When the building was abandoned, it was damaged by humidity and was replaced by a big shell of wood to improve the acoustics.

===Tower===
With a height of 117 m, the tower is modeled after that of [[Giralda]], the bell tower in the Cathedral of Seville. An elevator brings visitors to the balcony to enjoy sweeping views of Gijón.

The tower of the Universidad Laboral is the tallest building in Asturias and the tallest stone building in Spain.

==Current uses==
Several institutions are located in the main building, such as [[LABoral Centro de Arte y Creación Industrial]], faculties of the [[University of Oviedo]], the Drama High School of Asturias and the Professional Music School of Gijón. '''Laboral Ciudad de la Cultura''' was inaugurated in 2007.

In the rest of the lands bequeathed by the ''José Antonio Girón Foundation'' to the Universidad Laboral, other new facilities were created. In the Lloreda farm, a municipal golf course was created and in the Agronomic farm of [[Somió]], the High School of the Universidad Laboral was built. The old convent of the Clarisas is now the headquarters of the [[Radiotelevisión del Principado de Asturias]]. The Hospital of Cabueñes, the municipal morgue, the Scienfic and Technologic Park and the Campus of Gijón, as part of the [[University of Oviedo]], now occupy the former sporting grounds.

The world center of [[Research and development]] of the German multinational [[ThyssenKrupp]] is located In the northern wing, with a building of about 2,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The Universidad Laboral has been used in several films, including those of the Spanish director [[José Luis Garci]], ''[[La gran aventura de Mortadelo y Filemón]]'' and ''[[Brain Drain (film)|Fuga de Cerebros]]'', which stood in for [[Oxford University]].

Reverend '''William Miller'''  {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CIE}} (13 January 1838 – July 1923) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[educationalist]] and [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] [[missionary]] to [[Madras]]. He was also a member of [[Madras Legislative Council (1891–1909)|Madras Legislative Council]] for four terms—in 1893, 1895, 1899, and 1902.&lt;ref name="R3"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mcc.edu.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=168&amp;Itemid=580|title= Madras Christian College Milestones|quote= Miller becomes the member of the Madras Legislative Council in 1893, and again in 1895, 1899 and 1902. |publisher= mcc.edu.in |accessdate= 20 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R1"&gt;{{cite book |last= Doyle |first= Sean|title= Synthesizing the Vedanta: The Theology of Pierre Johanns, S.J |publisher= Peter Lang |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-S7DJLnkwG4C&amp;pg=PA72|pages= September |isbn= 9783039107087|year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"&gt;{{cite book |last= Eddy |first= Sherwood  |title= Pathfinders of the World Missionary Crusade|publisher= Ayer Publishing |url= |year= 1945 |pages= 95– |isbn= 9780836911275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was chiefly notable for transforming [[Madras Christian College]] into an [[ecumenical]] enterprise and imbuing the minds of [[Madras Province]] [[South Indians]] with ''Fulfilment theology'', with an idea of "Christ the fulfiller"—in a sense, he is considered not only the pioneer of ''Fulfilment theology'', but also of ''Hindu Renaissance'' by making [[Indian people|Indian]] converts to think Christianity in Indian context.

==Biography==
{{expand section|date=May 2012}}
Miller was born [[Thurso]] in 1838,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rev. Dr. William Miller|url=http://genealogy.links.org/links-cgi/readged?/home/ben/camilla-genealogy/current+c-miller97026+2-2-0-1-0|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was educated at [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen University]] and [[Edinburgh University]].&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;

He arrived Madras in 1864 at the age of twenty-four, as the only missionary of the Free Church of Scotland in Madras city at the time of his arrival. Initially, as a missionary, he was engaged in outdoor preaching, congregational work, medical aid, and the education of boys and girls.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R5"/&gt;

[[Madras Christian College]] received vitality with the arrival of Miller in 1862, and soon became the greatest architect of the college. In 1863, he envisioned that only Christian education could train the greatest leaders of [[India]], he began to specialise on the institution that later became the Madras Christian College—A Christian school[General Assembly School] founded on 3 April 1837 by [[John Anderson (missionary)|John Anderson]], Scottish missionary and the founder of the mission of the Free Church of Scotland at Madras, later became known as Madras Christian College that grew from the school into a college and then Campus under the leadership of William Miller. After he took over the college succeeding Anderson, within two years of his arrival, he upgraded the school into a college and reoriented the educational policy of the institution. The first college class was formed in 1864, studying for the First examination in Arts(FA) of the university. By 1865, the first class of six students appeared for matriculation examination. And, by 1867, a new class was opened to prepare for the BA courses. Miller procured the support of leading missions, including Anglican, Wesleyan, and Presbyterian bodies that ultimately turned a small sectarian institution into a mammoth and a central Christian college for all [[South India]], and soon to be in the front rank of all institutions in India. Miller transformed the institution into an ecumenical and co-operative enterprise and named it as Madras Christian College on 1 January 1877.&lt;ref name="R3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R4"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mcc.edu.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=295&amp;Itemid=275|title= Madras Christian College – Our Legacy|quote= Madras Christian College (MCC) began life as a School founded in 1837 by the Rev. John Anderson, a missionary from Scotland.  The School became a College in 1865 during Dr. William Miller's dynamic stewardship of the institution |publisher= mcc.edu.in |accessdate= 22 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He not only erected great buildings for the college, chiefly by his own gifts and those of his brother. but also garnered support and sponsorship from a group of loyal and able men, both [[Indian people|Indian]] and British. His dormitories, or college hostels were first of their kind in [[South India]]—he used these to train future government officials and members of municipal and local boards in the art of conducting public business and running democracy. The alumni of the college, occupied prominent positions in all fields, including national movements, politics and government offices.

Miller is credited for opening hostels, several academic and cultural associations, that ultimately shaped Madras Christian College into a premier educational institution in South Asia. He later opened up the institution for Hindu students to a Christward direction through education, rather than just conversion of their faith – [[Vengal Chakkarai|Vengal Chakkarai Chetty]], [[P. Chenchiah]], and many more were in fact attracted to Christianity under the influence of Miller.&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R4"/&gt;

He served as the active principal of [[Madras Christian College]] for 45 years, another 16 years as Honorary principal, and helped the government shape its educational policy as an educator in all over India. He worked as an educator in India until 1896, and also served as a leading member of [[Madras University]] syndicate. For his educational work, he won the appreciation and financial aid from the government.&lt;ref name="R3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;

He was nominated to [[Madras Legislative Council (1891–1909)]] consecutively four times in 1893, 1895, 1899, and 1902. In 1896, he was unanimously chosen the moderator of the [[General Assembly (presbyterian church)|General Assembly]] of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]], the highest honour accorded in the church. He received Kaiser-i-Hind Medal and several honorary degrees were conferred by the universities of Aberdeen and 
Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="R3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;

He was appointed as Vice-chancellor of the [[University of Madras]] in 1901. In 1907, due to ill-health, he left India to reside in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, and died in 1923 at the age of eighty-five.&lt;ref name="R3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;

A biography on William Miller entitled ''Dr. William Miller'' was written and published by O.Kandaswami Chetty in 1924.&lt;ref name="doc"/&gt;

==Theology==
{{expand section|date=May 2012}}
Miller argued that the [[Hinduism]] could not be excluded from the plans of God, and believed that Christianity and Hinduism could work in concentric circles to fulfill the master plans of God. Miller, who is considered as the pioneer of ''Fulfillment theology'', in his ''Scottish Missions in India'' published in 1868 noted that:{{cquote|Hinduism is emphatically a system, a mighty mass, a living unity and power, not only embracing, but weilding into one, the unnumbered millions by whom it is professed, as no other faith in the world does now, or probably has ever done. It is this feature in it that has chiefly determined the nature of our Missions. It must largely effect everything that can be wisely done for the liberation and englightenment of India.&lt;ref name="doc"/&gt;}}

Miller asserted that the institutional and historic Christianity is not superior to Hinduism; instead, it is Christ who is the fulfiller of Hinduism. According to him, though, Christ and His teachings were ultimately central, he felt that enriching truths can be found in Hinduism which would contribute to the common good of humanity and to the Church of Christ. He affirmed that Christianity has no monopoly on truth as Hinduism's emphasis on the immanence of God and on social solidarity has much to teach humanity;other religions could make contributions to the completeness of Christianity, while Christ can fulfill the aspirations of the followers of other religions.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;

Miller felt that educational institutes in India could not be used as places for conversion; instead, as avenues for preparing the [[Hindus]] in a Christian direction – ''Preparatio evangelica''. According to him, Christian missions are like leaven, though, not seen from outside, yet is innately transforming. According to O. Kandaswami Chetty, biographer of Dr. William Miller, for Miller "Christ was the friend of all that was good and true not only in Christianity, but in Hinduism."{{sic}} The idea of '''''Christ the fulfiller''''' imbued the minds of South India, part of then-Madras Presidency, due to the teachings of Miller at Madras Christian College and due to his missionary work in Madras. According to [[Eric J. Sharpe]], professor of Religious Studies at the [[University of Sydney]], [[J. N. Farquhar]]'s work on ''Fulfillment theology'' in [[Bengal]] was built on foundations originally laid in Madras.&lt;ref name="doc"/&gt;

Though, the object of missionary work and missionary colleges like Madras Christian College was to preach Christ and train Christians, Miller encouraged the Indian converts to rethink Christianity in Indian context, possibly to integrate Christianity and Hinduism; hence, was considered the pioneer of '''''Hindu Renaissance'''''. He discouraged [[proselytism]], encouraged the retention of national manners, and advocated the habit of independent thinking.&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;

==Honours==
* The library building in Madras Christian College is named after him as The Miller Memorial Library.
* [[Kaisar-i-Hind Medal]]
* Companion of the [[Order of the Indian Empire]] ([[1884 Birthday Honours|1884]])&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=25357 |page=2287 |date=23 May 1884 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wisconsin Education Association Council''' (WEAC) is an education [[Public-sector trade union]] representing the public policy, labor and professional interests of its members.&lt;ref name="WEACabout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weac.org/About_WEAC.aspx |title=Introduction to WEAC |last=Bell |first=Mary |publisher=Wisconsin Education Association Council |accessdate=8 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830043342/http://www.weac.org/About_WEAC.aspx |archivedate=August 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is affiliated with the [[National Education Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.org/home/3745.htm NEA official website].  Accessed February 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Its headquarters are located in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], [[Wisconsin]].

==History==
WEAC began as a statewide educational organization of teachers and administrators in 1853. After passage of a collective bargaining law for public employees, it evolved into a pro-active teachers union and in 1972 changed its name to the Wisconsin Education Association Council. Later, WEAC expanded its membership to education support staff, as well as UW, technical college and State of Wisconsin education and information professionals.&lt;ref name="WEACabout" /&gt;

WEAC represents its members in areas such as [[collective bargaining]], legislation, professional development and support and public relations. WEAC states that it advocates on behalf of the 865,000 children in Wisconsin public schools.&lt;ref name="WEACabout" /&gt;

WEAC also created the [[WEA Trust]] in 1970 to "provide an independent alternative to commercial insurance companies" "offer[ing] group health insurance to Wisconsin public schools. Currently, the Trust provides public school teachers, state health plan members, and local units of government with group insurance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatrust.com/AboutWEATrust/CompanyProfile.aspx |title=WEA Trust Webpage, Company Profile |publisher=Weatrust.com |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WEA Trust is not owned or financially tied to WEAC in any way, but the two organizations have worked closely together in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/business/wea-trust-tries-to-adapt-to-changes-in-state-law-d63u65a-139131104.html |title=WEA Trust Tries to Adapt to Changes in State Law |publisher=jsonline.com |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, 45 Wisconsin School districts sued WEA Trust for withholding district funds after collective bargaining contracts with WEAC concluded, and to reclaim funds from the Early Retirement Reinsurance Program. WEA Trust counter-sued against 14 School Districts, announcing they would drop litigation if the School Districts dropped their litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Trovato|first=Joe|title=Area school districts jump into WEA lawsuit|url=http://www.livinglakecountry.com/lakecountryreporter/news/area-school-districts-jump-into-wea-lawsuit-bi3pfen-137422673.html|accessdate=21 February 2013|newspaper=Lake Country Reporter|date=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heaton|first=Meg|title=School district joins class action lawsuit|url=http://www.hudsonstarobserver.com/event/article/id/46751/|accessdate=21 February 2013|newspaper=Hudson Star Observer|date=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[2011 Wisconsin Act 10|Act 10]] was signed into law by Wisconsin [[Scott Walker (politician)|Governor Scott Walker]]. This law limited collective bargaining for public employees, excluding state patrol troopers, firefighters, and inspectors, on all issues except for base pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Act 10|url=https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/acts/10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="budget fights"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703989504576128502316403060?mod=googlenews_wsjl|title=Public-Worker Unions Steel for Budget Fights|author=Trottman, Melanie|work=The Wall Street Journal|date= 2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;|title= http://oser.state.wi.us/docview.asp?docid=7246&lt;/ref&gt; This change to Wisconsin law had a profound [[2011 Wisconsin Act 10#Effect on unions|effect]] on WEAC and all other public-sector unions in the state. One of those effects was the loss of 29% of pre-Act 10 membership, since public employees of public schools were no longer forced to belong to a public sector union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DeFour|first=Matthew|title=Teachers unions WEAC, AFT-Wisconsin consider merger|url=http://host.madison.com/news/local/education/local_schools/teachers-unions-weac-aft-wisconsin-consider-merger/article_8d73e2d8-22f1-11e2-8710-0019bb2963f4.html|accessdate=21 February 2013|newspaper=Wisconsin State Journal|date=October 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Act 10, dues were collected by school districts involuntarily. After Act 10, WEAC was required to collect dues and resulted in WEAC reducing its staff by 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Richards|first=Erin|title=WEAC issues layoff notices for 40% of staff|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/education/127806733.html|accessdate=21 February 2013|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal|date=August 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* WEAC was the top lobbyist in Wisconsin in 2010. (10,462 hours, $2,143,588)&lt;ref name="Government Accountability Board"&gt;{{cite web|last=Government Accountability Board|title=G.A.B.

* WEAC was the 2nd-place lobbyist in 2011, (Behind the Wisconsin State AFL-CIO). (9,370 hours, $2,062,716)&lt;ref name="Government Accountability Board"/&gt;

==Legal affairs==
WEAC attempts to interview candidates for political and judicial office, but at least one judicial candidate has refused an interview with the association, claiming, "it might give the impression of a hidden agenda."&lt;ref&gt;Frank Schultz, "Three vie for 4th District Court of Appeals judgeship," ''Janesville Gazette'', February 13, 2010.

===Suits against Virtual School===
WEAC had made several suits in the recent years against Wisconsin virtual schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wivirtualschoolfamilies.org/news/ |title=Wisconsin Coalition of Virtual School Families News |publisher=Wivirtualschoolfamilies.org |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such suit is when the association sued the [[Wisconsin Virtual Academy]] and Connections Academy, because WEAC felt that the two schools "were operating in violation of open enrollment, charter school and teacher licensing laws".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Scott Bauer |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.chippewa.com/articles/2010/02/09/news/doc4b71f16205015393606112.txt |title=Audit: Virtual schools close to capacity |publisher=''The Chippewa Herald'' |date=2010-02-09 |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wisconsin Virtual Academy was first established in September 2003 with full approval of the DPI. When WEAC sued WIVA, the DPI was a defendant, but it sided with WEAC in the lawsuit.

===Suit against State of Wisconsin for Constitutional 1st and 14th Amendment violations===

'''Background'''

The Wisconsin Legislative Branch wrote a bill to limit collective bargaining laws that were established in Wisconsin in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/acts/11Act10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which was signed into law by the Governor. The bill was halted by the Dane County Circuit Judge Maryann Sumi.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wispolitics.com/1006/110526Ozanne_decision.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Wisconsin Supreme Court unanimously found Judge Sumi to be in violation of Constitutional Separation of Powers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&amp;seqNo=66078&lt;/ref&gt; The Wisconsin Secretary of State [[Doug La Follette]] refused to publish the law immediately&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walker |first=Don |url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/123921154.html |title=Unions seek to overturn court order reinstating collective-bargaining law |publisher=JSOnline |date=2011-06-15 |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision, enabling WEAC, along with other unions which represented public employees, to file a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief against Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and others in the administration&lt;ref name="jsonline1"&gt;http://media.jsonline.com/documents/unions_relief_complaint.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis that:

'''Basis of Lawsuit'''

* An employer that compensates employees of a public union with different specialties (in this case Public Safety employees), violates the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America.&lt;ref name="jsonline1"/&gt;
* The lack of a public union to involuntary take funds from public employees in the State of Wisconsin violates the 1st Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America, because without those funds, the public unions claim, removes the ability for public unions to exercise free speech.&lt;ref name="jsonline1"/&gt;

She teaches at [[Loyola Law School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lls.edu/academics/faculty/murray.html|title=Murray, Yxta M. - Loyola Law School, Los Angeles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work appeared in ''Buzz,'' ''Glamour'', and ''ZYZZYVA''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zyzzyva.org/published.fiction.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103031254/http://www.zyzzyva.org/published.fiction.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Locas'' - "Murray perfectly captures the patois and fury of the Mexican women..." and "The reader equipped with a Spanish-English dictionary has the best chance to grasp all the nuances of this convincing, under-the-skin work.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8021-1605-5|website=www.publishersweekly.com |title=Locas |publisher=PWxyz LLC |accessdate=12 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "It's that predictable both in plot and texture." and "A female Scarface, this straightforward narrative charts the rise and fall of Latin gangsters on L.A.'s mean streets with considerable documentary fervor but not much depth.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/yxta-murray-murray/locas/ |website=www.kirkusreviews.com |title=Locus|date=1 March 1997 |publisher=Kirkus Media LLC |accessdate=12 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Even if Locas is as persuasive and true-sounding as a smart documentary, Murray keeps her novel as tight as her main character keeps her mind..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wagley|first1=Catherine |title=Best L.A. Novel Ever: Chester Himes' If He Hollers Let Him Go vs. Yxta Maya Murray's Locas|url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/best-la-novel-ever-chester-himes-if-he-hollers-let-him-go-vs-yxta-maya-murrays-locas-4179713 |accessdate=12 May 2015 |work=|date=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''What it Takes to Get to Vegas'' - "The suffering hero, the bullet in the gut, come to think of it, this does sound like The Natural, doesn't it? But the boxing story works, told to us by a femme fatale for whom we can feel much sympathy.",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Wedge| first =Phil | title =Yxta Maya Murray.

''The Conquest'' - "Another ponderous and trendy novel from Murray..." and "A fluid and genuinely interesting story badly weighed down by leaden prose ... and a thoroughly hackneyed view of Latin American history.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/yxta-maya-murray/the-conquest/ |website=www.kirkusreviews.com |title=The Conquest |date=1 September 2002 |publisher=Kirkus Media LLC |accessdate=12 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The subplot about Sara's literary sleuthing ties the two stories neatly together and gives the book a satisfying edge of suspense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-009359-4|website=www.publishersweekly.com |title=The Conquest |publisher=PWxyz LLC |accessdate=12 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Queen Jade'' - "Fiery beauties and rakish hunks can’t enliven this overblown melodrama.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/yxta-maya-murray/the-queen-jade/ |website=www.kirkusreviews.com |title=The Queen Jade |date=15 December 2004 |publisher=Kirkus Media LLC |accessdate=12 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "These entertaining characters are all sharply drawn, and the depiction of the teeming jungle is breathtaking. But Murray is less successful at conveying the mythos of the Queen Jade and the history of its pursuit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-058264-7|website=www.publishersweekly.com |title=The Queen Jade |publisher=PWxyz LLC |accessdate=12 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The King's Gold: An Old World Novel of Adventure'' - "In heroine Sanchez, Murray has created a perfect counterweight to the traditional macho hero."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-089108-4|website=www.publishersweekly.com |title=The King's Gold |publisher=PWxyz LLC |accessdate=12 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Good Girl's Guide To Getting Kidnapped'' - " This may not be great literature, but it holds strong appeal for teens who can’t get enough street lit.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/yxta-maya-murray/the-good-girls-guide-to-getting-kidnapped/ |website=www.kirkusreviews.com |title=The Good Girl's Guide To Getting Kidnapped |date=15 November 2009 |publisher=Kirkus Media LLC |accessdate=12 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "This fast-paced story, heavy with street dialogue and slang, should have ample teen appeal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-59514-341-9 |website=www.publishersweekly.com |title=The Good Girl's Guide To Getting Kidnapped |publisher=PWxyz LLC |accessdate=12 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
