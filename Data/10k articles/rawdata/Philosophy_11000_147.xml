'''''An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States''''' is a 1913 book by American historian [[Charles A. Beard]].

==Summary==
''An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States'' argues that the structure of the [[Constitution of the United States]] was motivated primarily by the personal financial interests of the [[Founding Fathers]]; Beard contends that the authors of ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' represented an [[interest group]] themselves. More specifically, Beard contends that the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] was attended by, and the Constitution was therefore written by, a "cohesive" elite seeking to protect its personal property (especially federal [[Government bond|bonds]]) and economic standing. Beard examined the occupations and property holdings of the members of the convention from tax and census records, contemporaneous news accounts, and biographical sources, demonstrating the degree to which each stood to benefit from various Constitutional provisions. Beard pointed out, for example, that [[George Washington]] was the wealthiest landowner in the country, and had provided significant funding towards the Revolution. Beard traces the Constitutional guarantee that the newly formed nation would pay its debts to the desire of Washington and similarly situated lenders to have their costs refunded.

==Historiography==
Historian [[Carl L. Becker]] in ''History of Political Parties in the Province of New York, 1760–1776'' (1909) formulated the [[Progressive Era|Progressive]] interpretation of the American Revolution. He said there were two revolutions: one against Britain to obtain home rule, and the other to determine who should rule at home. Charles A. Beard in ''An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States'' (1913) and ''Economic Origins of Jeffersonian Democracy'' (1915) extended Becker's thesis down to 1800 in terms of [[class conflict]].  To Beard, the Constitution was a [[counter-revolution]], set up by rich [[Bond (finance)|bond]] holders (bonds were "[[personal property]]"), in opposition to the farmers and planters (land was "[[real property]].") The Constitution, Beard argued, was designed to reverse the radical democratic tendencies unleashed by the Revolution among the common people, especially farmers and [[debtors]] (people who owed money to the rich). In 1800, said Beard, the farmers and debtors, led by plantation slaveowners, overthrew the capitalists and established [[Jeffersonian democracy]].

Other historians supported the class conflict interpretation, noting that the states confiscated great semifeudal landholdings of Loyalists and gave them out in small parcels to ordinary farmers. Conservatives such as [[William Howard Taft]] were shocked at the Progressive interpretation because it seem to belittle the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Nore, ''Charles A. Beard, an Intellectual Biography'' (1983) p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; History professors, however, mostly adopted it and by 1930 it became the standard interpretation of the era among them, but was largely ignored by the legal community.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Rodell stressed how it was ignored by lawyers and jurists in ''Yale Law Journal,'' Vol. 45, No. 7 (May, 1936), pp. 1327-1330 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/792027  in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning at around 1950, [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] historians argued that the Progressive interpretation was factually incorrect; they were led by Charles A. Barker, Philip Crowl, Richard P. McCormick, William Pool, Robert Thomas, John Munroe, Robert E. Brown and B. Kathryn Brown, and especially [[Forrest McDonald]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Livingston Schuyler, "Forrest McDonald's Critique of the Beard Thesis," ''Journal of Southern History'' 1961 27(1): 73-80; Peter J. Coleman, "Beard, McDonald, and Economic Determinism in American Historiography," ''Business History Review'' 1960 34(1): 113-121&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald in ''We The People: The Economic Origins of the Constitution'' (1958) argued that Beard had misinterpreted the economic interests involved in writing the Constitution. Instead of two interests—landed and mercantile—which conflicted, McDonald asserted that there were three dozen identifiable interests that forced the delegates to bargain. Evaluating the debate, historian [[Peter Novick]] concluded:
:"By the early 1960s it was generally accepted within the historical profession that [...] Beard’s Progressive version of the [...] framing of the Constitution had been decisively refuted. American historians came to see [...] the framers of the Constitution, rather than having self-interested motives, were led by concern for political unity, national economic development, and diplomatic security."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Novick, ''That Noble Dream'' (1988) p 336. Ellen Nore, Beard’s biographer, concludes his interpretation of the Constitution collapsed due to more recent and sophisticated analysis. Ellen Nore, "Charles A. Beard's Economic Interpretation of the Origins of the Constitution," ''This Constitution: a Bicentennial Chronicle'' 1987 (17): 39-44&lt;/ref&gt;

The Progressive interpretation of the era was largely replaced by the [[intellectual history]] approach that stressed the power of ideas, especially [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], in stimulating the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;See Forrest McDonald, "Colliding with the Past," ''Reviews in American History'' 25.1 (1997) 13-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Annemarie Mol''' (born 13 September 1958) is a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[ethnographer]] and [[philosopher]]. She is the Professor of Anthropology of the Body at the [[University of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/a.mol/ Annemarie Mol home page]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Winner of the Constantijn &amp; Christiaan Huijgens Grant from the NWO in 1990 to study 'Differences in Medicine', she was awarded a European Research Council Advanced Grant in 2010 to study 'The Eating Body in Western Practice and Theory'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agentschapnl.nl/sites/default/files/bijlagen/ERC%20in%20the%20Spotlight%202011.pdf European Research Council: ERC in the Spotlight.]&lt;/ref&gt; She has helped to develop post-[[Actor-network theory|ANT]]/[[Feminism|feminist]] understandings of science, technology and medicine. In her earlier work she explored the performativity of health care practices, argued that realities are generated within those practices, and noted that since practices differ, so too do realities. The body, as she expressed it, is multiple: it is more than one but it is also less than many (since the different versions of the body also overlap in health care practices).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mol | first = Annemarie | title = The body multiple: ontology in medical practice | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham, North Carolina | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780822329176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an empirical argument about [[ontology]] (which is the branch of philosophy that explores being, existence, or the categories of being.) As a part of this she also developed the notion of 'ontological politics', arguing that since realities or the conditions of possibility vary between practices, this means that they are not given but might be changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Mol | first = Annemarie | contribution = Ontological politics: a word and some questions | editor-last1 = Law | editor-first1 = John | editor-last2 = Hassard | editor-first2 = John | editor-link1 = John Law (sociologist) | title = Actor network theory and after | pages = 74-89 | publisher = Blackwell/Sociological Review | location = Oxford England Malden, Massachusetts | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780631211945 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mol has been member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/nl/leden/leden/7104 |title=Annemarie Mol |language=Dutch |publisher=[[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] |date= |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mol has written and worked with a range of scholars including [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/sociology/research/resalph.htm#lr Lancaster University's Sociology Department: List of publications by John Law and co-authors]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent talk, Mol relates the concept of globalization to the interconnections of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=pblleefomgeving|title=Nature Outlook 2016 Philosophers’ dialogue - Annemarie Mol|date=2015-12-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5m-QMJ6SFg|accessdate=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prizes==

In 2004 she received the [[Ludwik Fleck Prize]] ([[Society for Social Studies of Science]], '''4S''') for her book ''The Body Multiple''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4sonline.org/prizes/fleck Ludwik Fleck Prize]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 she was awarded the [[Spinoza Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/spinoza+prize/spinoza+laureates/overview+by+year/2012 |title=NWO Spinoza Prize 2012 |publisher=Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research |date=11 September 2014 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brahmo Samaj''' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: ব্রাহ্ম সমাজ ''Bramho Shômaj'') is the societal component of [[Brahmoism]], which began as a [[monotheist]]ic reformist movement of the  [[Hinduism|Hindu religion]] that appeared during the [[Bengal Renaissance]]. It is practised today mainly as the [[Adi Dharm]] after its eclipse in [[Bengal]] consequent to the exit of the [[Tattwabodini Sabha]] from its ranks in 1839. After the publication of [[Hemendranath Tagore]]'s Brahmo ''Anusthan'' (code of practice) in 1860 which formally divorced Brahmoism from [[Hinduism]], the first Brahmo Samaj was founded in 1861 at [[Lahore]] by Pandit Nobin Chandra Roy.

It was one of the most influential religious movements in India&lt;ref&gt;[[J. N. Farquhar]],  [https://archive.org/stream/modernreligiousm00farquoft/modernreligiousm00farquoft_djvu.txt ''Modern Religious Movements of India''] (1915), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; and made a significant contribution to the making of modern [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;"Brahmo Samaj and the making of modern India, David Kopf, publ. 1979 Princeton University Press (USA)."&lt;/ref&gt; It was started at [[Calcutta]] on 20 August 1828 by Raja [[Ram Mohan Roy]] and [[Debendranath Tagore]] as reformation of the prevailing [[Brahminical Hinduism|Brahmanism]] of the time (specifically [[Kulin Brahmin|Kulin]] practices) and began the [[Bengal Renaissance]] of the 19th century pioneering all religious, social and educational advance of the Hindu community in the 19th century. Its Trust Deed was made in 1830 formalising its inception and it was duly and publicly inaugurated in January 1830 by the consecration of the first house of prayer, now known as the Adi Brahmo Samaj.&lt;ref&gt;"Modern Religious movements in India, J.N.Farquhar (1915)" page 29 etc.&lt;/ref&gt; From the ''Brahmo Samaj'' springs Brahmoism, the most recent of legally recognised religions in India and Bangladesh, reflecting its foundation on reformed spiritual Hinduism with vital elements of Judeo-Islamic faith and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brahmosamaj.in |title=Official Brahmo website |publisher=Brahmosamaj.in |date= |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawcommissionbangladesh.org/reports/36.pdf |title=Bangladesh Law Commission |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raja Rammohan Roy founded Brahmo Samaj in 1828 in the name of Brahmo Sabha.

==Meaning of the name==

The Brahmo Samaj literally denotes community ({{lang-sa|italic=yes|'samaj'}}) of men who worship [[Brahman]] the highest reality.&lt;ref&gt;page 1 Chapter 1 Volume 1 ''History of the Brahmo Samaj'' by Sivanath Sastri, 1911, 1st edn. publisher R.Chatterji, Cornwallis St. Calcutta. ''Brahmo'' (ব্রাহ্ম ''bramho'') literally means "one who worships [[Brahman]]", and ''Samaj'' (সমাজ ''shômaj'') mean "community of men".&lt;/ref&gt; In reality Brahmo Samaj does not discriminate between caste, creed or religion and is an assembly of all sorts and descriptions of people without distinction, meeting publicly for the sober, orderly, religious and devout adoration of "''the (nameless) unsearchable Eternal, Immutable Being who is the Author and Preserver of the Universe''."&lt;ref&gt;[[Trust deed of Brahmo Sabha]] 1830&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrine==
The following doctrines, as noted in Renaissance of Hinduism, are common to all varieties and offshoots of the ''Brahmo Samaj'':&lt;ref&gt;Source: The Gazetteer of India, Volume 1: Country and people. Delhi, Publications Division, Government of India, 1965. CHAPTER VIII – Religion. HINDUISM
by Dr. C.P.Ramaswami Aiyar, Dr. Nalinaksha Dutt, Prof. A.R.Wadia, Prof. M.Mujeeb, Dr.Dharm Pal and Fr. Jerome D'Souza, S.J.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Brahmo Samajists have no faith in any scripture as an authority.
* Brahmo Samajists have no faith in Avatars
* Brahmo Samajists denounce polytheism and idol-worship.
* Brahmo Samajists are against caste restrictions.
* Brahmo Samajists make faith in the doctrines of Karma and Rebirth optional.

==Divisions of Brahmo Samaj==
*[[Adi Brahmo Samaj]]
*[[Sadharan Brahmo Samaj]]

===Anusthanic versus Ananusthanic Brahmos===
To understand the differences between the two streams of Brahmo Samaj it is essential to understand that these implicit distinctions are based on [[caste]]. The Anusthanic Brahmos are exclusively either [[Brahmins]] or casteless, and exclusively adhere to Brahmoism and have no other faith. The Ananusthanic Brahmo Samajists, however, are from the remaining main caste divisions of Hinduism like [[Kayastha]], [[Baidya]] etc. and hence within the [[Karmic]] / [[Reincarnation|Rebirth]] wheel to eternally progress (i.e. ''Sanatan Dharm'') to God by moving up caste hierarchies, unlike anusthanic Brahmos for whom the next step after death is reintegration and renewal with 'God'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://true.brahmosamaj.in/brahmo-anusthanic-ananusthanics.html |title=Anusthanic Brahmos, Ananusthnic Brahmo Samaj |publisher=World Brahmo Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brahmo Sabha===
On 20 August 1828 the first assembly of the ''Brahmo Sabha'' (progenitor of the Brahmo Samaj) was held at the North Calcutta house of [[Basu#Notables|''Feringhee'' Kamal Bose]]. This day was celebrated by [[Brahmo]]s as ''Bhadrotsab'' (ভাদ্রোৎসব ''Bhadrotshôb'' "[[Bhadro]] celebration"). These meetings were open to all Brahmins and there was no formal organisation or theology as such.&lt;ref&gt;"Socio-Religious Reform Movements in British India" By Kenneth W. Jones page 33-34, publ. 1989 Cambridge Univ. Press. {{ISBN|0-521-24986-4}} This ''Sabha'' was convened at Calcutta by religious reformer [[Ram Mohan Roy|Raja Rammohun Roy]] for his family and friends settled there. The ''Sabha'' regularly gathered on Saturday between seven o'clock to nine o'clock. These were informal meetings of [[Bengali Brahmin]]s (the "twice born"), accompanied by Upanishadic recitations in [[Sanskrit]] followed by [[Bengali language|Bengali]] translations of the Sanskrit recitation and singing of Brahmo hymns composed by Rammohun.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Modern Religious movements in India, J.N.Farquhar (1915)"&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 1830 influential progressive members of the closely related [[Kulin Brahmin]] clan&lt;ref&gt;"A History of Brahmin Clans" ({{IAST|Brāhmaṇa Vaṃshõ kā Itihāsa}}) in Hindi, by Dorilāl Śarmā, published by Rāśtriya Brāmhamana Mahāsabhā, Vimal Building, Jamirābād, Mitranagar, Masūdābād, Aligarh-1, 2nd edn. 1998. and also footnotes to [[Bengali Brahmin]]&lt;/ref&gt; scurrilously&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Tagore,_Prince_Dwarkanath |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703142014/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Tagore%2C_Prince_Dwarkanath |archivedate=3 July 2015 |title=Tagore, (Prince) Dwarkanath |publisher=Banglapedia |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate=2015-07-23 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; described as [[Pirali Brahmin]] ''ie.'' ostracised for service in the Mughal ''Nizaamat'' of Bengal) of Tagore (''Thakur'') and Roy (''Vandopādhyāya'') ''zumeendar'' family mutually executed the [[Trust deed of Brahmo Sabha]] for the first [[Adi Brahmo Samaj]] (place of worship) on Chitpore Road (now Rabindra Sarani), [[Kolkata]], [[India]] with [[Ram Chandra Vidyabagish]] as first resident superintendent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://true.brahmosamaj.in/brahmo-trust-deed.html |title=Online copy of 1830 Trust Deed |publisher=brahmosamaj.in |date= |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 January 1830 or 11th ''Magh'', the ''Adi Brahmo'' premises were publicly inaugurated (with about 500 Brahmins and 1 Englishman present). This day is celebrated by Brahmos as ''Maghotsab'' (মাঘোৎসব ''Maghotshôb'' "[[Magh (Bengali calendar)|Magh]] celebration").

In November 1830 Rammohun Roy left for England. [[Akbar II]] had conferred the title of 'Raja' to Rammohun Roy.&lt;ref&gt;''Socio-Religious Reform Movements in British India'' By Kenneth W. Jones page 34, publ. 1989 Cambridge Univ. Press. {{ISBN|0-521-24986-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brief Eclipse of Brahmo Sabha===
With Rammohun's departure for England in 1830, the affairs of Brahmo Sabha were effectively managed by Trustees [[Dwarkanath Tagore]] and Pandit Ram Chandra Vidyabagish, with Dwarkanath instructing his ''[[Diwan (title)|diwan]]'' to manage affairs.

By the time of Rammohun's death in 1833 near Bristol (UK), attendance at the ''Sabha'' dwindled and the Telugu Brahmins revived idolatry. The ''zameendars'', being preoccupied in business, had little time for affairs of ''Sabha'', and flame of ''Sabha'' was almost extinguished.&lt;ref&gt;H.C.Sarkar-History of the Brahmo Religion (1906)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tattwabodhini period===
On 6 October 1839 [[Debendranath Tagore]], son of [[Dwarkanath Tagore|(Prince) Dwarkanath Tagore]], established ''Tattvaranjini Sabha'' which was shortly thereafter renamed the Tattwabodhini (''Truth-seekers'') Sabha. Initially confined to immediate members of the Tagore family, in 2 years it mustered over 500 members. In 1840 Debendranath published a Bangla translation of ''Katha Upanishad''. A modern researcher describes the Sabha's philosophy as ''modern middle-class (bourgeois) Vedanta.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;2007: Brian Hatcher "Journal of American Academy of Religion"&lt;/ref&gt; Among its first members were the "two giants of Hindu reformation and [[Bengal Renaissance]], [[Akshay Kumar Datta]] "who in 1839 emerged from the life of an anonymous squalor-beset individual" and [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]] the "indigenous modernizer".&lt;ref&gt;"Brahmo Samaj and the making of modern India, David Kopf, Princeton University press", pp 43–57&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Covenant and merger with the Tattwabodhini Sabha===
On 7th Pous 1765 Shaka (1843) Debendranath Tagore and twenty other Tattwabodhini stalwarts were formally invited by Pt. Vidyabagish into the Trust of Brahmo Sabha. The Pous Mela at Santiniketan starts on this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabindrabharatiuniversity.net/museum/tagore_family/tagore_society.htm |title=Rabindra Bharati Museum Kolkata, The Tagores &amp;amp; Society |publisher=Rabindrabharatiuniversity.net |date= |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this day forth, the Tattwabodhini Sabha dedicated itself to promoting Ram Mohan Roy's creed.&lt;ref&gt;"Bourgeois Hinduism", Brian Allison Hatcher. pg 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; The other Brahmins who swore the First Covenant of Brahmoism are:-

===Disagreement with the Tattwabodhini===
In Nov 1855 the Rev. Charles Dall (a Unitarian minister of Boston) arrived in Calcutta to start his mission and  immediately established contact with Debendranath and other Brahmos. Debendranath's suspicion of foreigners alienated Dall and in 1857, Debendranath Tagore barred the entry of the Reverend from the Sabha premises for preaching ''the name of Christ who some people worship as God'' within.&lt;ref&gt;"The Brahmo Samaj and making of Modern India", David Kopf, publ. Princeton Univ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Brahmoism, or a history of reformed Hinduism" (1884), R.C.Dutt&lt;/ref&gt; Debendranath then proceeded on spiritual retreat to [[Shimla|Simla]]. Dall, immediately formed a counter group "The friends of Rammmohun Roy Society" and then got admitted a protégé to Sabha. The presence of Dall's protégé [[Keshub Chandra Sen]] (a non-Brahmin) into the Calcutta Brahmo Sabha in 1857 while Debendranath was away in Simla caused considerable stress in the movement, with many long time Tattvabodhini Brahmin members publicly leaving the Brahmo Sabha and institutions due to his high-handed ways. In September  1858, Debendranath returned to Calcutta to resolve the simmering disputes. but his conservative mien did not allow him to take decisive steps. He proceeded on a sea voyage to [[Ceylon]] accompanied by Sen and his 2nd son Satyendranath (a firm admirer of Mr Sen) but no concord was achieved. In 1859, the venerable and beloved Secretary of the Tattwabodhini Sabha [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]] resigned from the Brahmo Sabha in the face of Debendranath's vacillation. A meeting of the Tatwabodhini was promptly summoned with Debendranath resigning from the group he had founded. His third son [[Hemendranath Tagore]] then a boy barely 15 years in age, and the favorite pupil of Vidyasgar, was commonly acclaimed as Debendranath's successor to head the Tattwabodhini. In the course of time he would become known as the ''MahaAcharya'' (or ''Great Teacher'').

===Expansion of the Tattwabodhini Sabha===
Disgusted by politics within the [[Tagore family]] and the support to K. C. Sen's faction by his own brother  [[Satyendranath Tagore]], Hemendranath took the bold decisions to expand his Sabha out from Calcutta. His close associate Pandit Nobin Chandra Roy who had joined the new institution of "Railways" in 1860 as its "Paymaster" for [[Upper India]] was tasked to spread Brahmoism there. With a predominantly monotheistic populace following [[Islam]] and [[Sikhism]] it was perceived as fertile soil for Rammohun's message. The Tattwabodhini decreed that the uncorrupted faith of the original 1830 Trust Deed would be known there as the [[Adi Dharm]] to distinguish it from the distorted versions of the squabbling factions of Calcutta. The steps taken by Hemendranath Tagore, with the blessing of his father, was to institute in 1860 a suit before the Supreme Court to restore the title "Brahmo Samaj" to his faction. After losing in this suit in 1861, Keshub Sen's faction altered the name of their Samaj from "The Brahmo Samaj of India" to "Navabidhan (or the New Dispensation)". With victory in this suit and the promulgation of his ''Brahmo Anusthan'' (Code of Brahmaic doctrine and practice) in 1861, Hemendranath's Samaj-ists are henceforth known as the "Anusthanic" Brahmos (or Brahmos who follow the Code). The other factions were designated as "''An''anusthanic" Brahmos (or those who do not follow the Code) (this distinction was again to be legally examined before the Privy Council of Great Britain in 1901 and in 1902 the Privy Council upheld the 1897 finding of the Chief Court of the Punjab that the Adi Dharm (''anusthanic'' Brahmos) were definitely not Hindus whereas the ''Ananusthanics'' Brahmos of Calcutta fall within Hinduism).

===Foundation of the Brahmo Samaj ===
In 1861 the Brahmo ''Somaj'' (as it was spelled then) was founded at [[Lahore]] by Nobin Roy.&lt;ref&gt;page.4 "Pakistan journal of history and culture, Volume 11", by National Institute of Historical and Cultural Research (Pakistan)&lt;/ref&gt; It included many Bengalis from the Lahore Bar Association. Many branches were opened in the Punjab, at [[Quetta]], [[Rawalpindi]], [[Amritsar]] etc.

===First Secession===
Disagreement with the Tattvabodhini came to a head publicly between the period of 1 August 1865 till November 1866 with many tiny splinter groups styling themselves as ''Brahmo''. The most notable of these groups styled itself "Brahmo Samaj of India". This period is also referred to in the histories of the secessionists as the "First Schism".&lt;ref&gt;Pt.Shivnath Shastri: Brahmo History- 1911.Page 106-107, 2nd edn.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brahmo Samaj and Swami Narendranath Vivekananda===

[[Swami Vivekananda]] was influenced by the Brahmo Samaj of India, and visited the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EtcoeaQIQdAC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=swami+vivekananda+brahmo+samaj&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a7FzeUu_v5&amp;sig=eCFfRpNBcuMIH1k4hRRnBlN8Fms&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU4_Ckmu3SAhWp6IMKHS7UDoIQ6AEIMzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=swami%20vivekananda%20brahmo%20samaj&amp;f=false |title=Book: "Swami Vivekananda in India: A Corrective Biography" |date=31 December 1999 |first1=Rajagopal |last1=Chattopadhyaya |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers Private Limited |accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current status and number of adherents===
While the various Calcutta sponsored movements declined after 1920 and faded into obscurity after the [[Partition of India]], the [[Adi Dharm]] creed has expanded and is now the 9th largest of India's enumerated religions with 7.83 million adherents, heavily concentrated between the states of  [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. In the Indian census of 2001 only 177 persons declared themselves a "Brahmo", but the number of subscriber members to Brahmo Samaj is somewhat larger at around 20,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brahmo.org/brahmo-faq.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725101858/http://brahmo.org/brahmo-faq.html |archivedate=2011-07-25 |title=Brahmo Samaj FAQ Frequently asked Questions |publisher=Brahmo.org |date=2011-07-25 |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.nabble.com/Re%3A--brahmoconference--Happy-Maghotsava-p27574782.html Statewise census computation] by the [[Brahmo Conference Organisation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social and religious reform ==
In all fields of social reform, including abolition of the [[caste system]] and of the [[Dowry#In India|dowry system]], [[emancipation of women]], and improving the educational system, the ''Brahmo Samaj'' reflected the ideologies of the [[Bengal Renaissance]]. Brahmoism, as a means of discussing the dowry system, was a central theme of [[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]]'s noted 1914 [[Bengali language]] [[novella]], ''[[Parineeta (novel)|Parineeta]]''.

In 1866, [[Keshub Chandra Sen]] organised the more radical "Brahmo Samaj of India" with overtones of Christianity. He campaigned for the education of women and against child marriages. But he nonetheless arranged a marriage for his own underage daughter. The ''Brahmo Samaj of India'' split after this act of underage marriage generated a controversy and his pro-British utterances and leaning towards Christian rites generated more controversies. A third group, "Sadharan (ordinary) Brahmo Samaj", was formed in 1878. It gradually reverted to the teaching of the Upanishads but continued the work of social reform. The movement, always an elite group without significant popular following, lost force in the 20th century.

After the controversy of underage marriage of Keshub Chunder Sen's daughter, the ''Special Marriages Act of 1872'' was enacted to set the minimum age of 14 years for marriage of girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Brahma_Sabha |title=Brahma Sabha |publisher=Banglapedia |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Brahmo marriages were thereafter solemnised under this law. Many Indians resented the requirement of the affirmation "I am not Hindu, nor a Mussalman, nor a Christian" for solemnising a marriage under this Act. The requirement of this declaration was imposed by [[Henry James Sumner Maine]], legal member of Governor General's Council appointed by Britain. The 1872 Act was repealed by the [[Special Marriage Act, 1954]] under which any person of any religion could marry. The [[Hindu Marriage Act]], 1955 applies to all Hindus including followers of the Brahmo Samaj. In India the statutory minimum age of marriage for followers of Brahmo Samaj is the same as for all Indians, viz., 21 years for males and 18 years for females. It is also the age of marriage in Bangladesh.

It also supported social reform movements of people not directly attached to the ''Samaj'', such as [[Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar|Pandit Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar]]’s movement which promoted widow remarriage.

{{redirect|Coincide|the album by Dewey Redman|Coincide (album)}}
A '''coincidence''' is a remarkable concurrence of events or circumstances that have no apparent causal connection with one another. 
The perception of remarkable coincidences may lead to [[supernatural]], [[occult]], or [[paranormal]] claims. Or it may lead to belief in [[fatalism]], which is a doctrine that events will happen in the exact manner of a predetermined plan.

From a [[Statistics|statistical]] perspective, coincidences are inevitable and often less remarkable than they may appear intuitively. An example is the [[birthday problem]], which shows that the [[probability]] of two persons having the same birthday already exceeds 50% in  a group of only 23 persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mathis |first=Frank H. |date=June 1991 |title=A Generalized Birthday Problem |journal=Carl Review |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=265–70 |issn=0036-1445 |doi= 10.1137/1033051 |oclc=37699182 |jstor=2031144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The first known usage of the word is from c. 1605 with the meaning "exact correspondence in substance or nature" from the French ''coincidence'', from ''coincider'', from Medieval Latin ''coincidere''. The definition evolved in the 1640s as "occurrence or existence during the same time", and again in the writings of Sir Thomas Browne as "a concurrence of events with no apparent connection" around the 1680s.&lt;ref name="Etymonline coincidence Archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=coincidence&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |website=Etymonline |accessdate=6 December 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206124137/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=coincidence&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |archivedate=6 December 2016 |df= |title=Coincidence &amp;#124; Origin and meaning of coincidence by Online Etymology Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster coincidence Archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coincidence |website=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=6 December 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206124243/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coincidence |archivedate=6 December 2016 |df= |title=Definition of COINCIDENCE }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford coincidence Archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/coincidence |website=Oxford Dictionary |accessdate=6 December 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206123850/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/coincidence |archivedate=6 December 2016 |df= |title=Coincidence &amp;#124; Definition of coincidence in English by Oxford Dictionaries }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As synchronicity==
Swiss psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]] developed a theory which states that remarkable coincidences occur because of what he called "[[synchronicity]]," which he defined as an "acausal connecting principle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jung |first=Carl |edition=first Princeton/Bollingen paperback|date=1973 |title=Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle |location=Princeton, New Jersey |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-15050-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The [[Carl Jung|Jung-]][[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]] theory of "synchronicity", conceived by a physicist and a psychologist, both eminent in their fields, represents perhaps the most radical departure from the world-view of mechanistic science in our time. Yet they had a precursor, whose ideas had a considerable influence on Jung: the Austrian biologist [[Paul Kammerer]], a wild [[genius]] who committed suicide in 1926, at the age of forty-five.|Arthur Koestler, ''[[The Roots of Coincidence]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koestler |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Koestler |title=The Roots of Coincidence |edition=hardcover |publisher=Random House |year=1972 |isbn=978-0-394-48038-1 |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of Kammerer's passions was collecting coincidences. He published a book titled ''Das Gesetz der Serie'' (''The Law of Series''), which has not been translated into English.  In this book, he recounted 100 or so anecdotes of coincidences that had led him to formulate his theory of seriality.

He postulated that all events are connected by waves of seriality. Kammerer was known to make notes in public parks of how many people were passing by, how many of them carried umbrellas, etc. [[Albert Einstein]] called the idea of seriality "interesting and by no means absurd."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/connecting-coincidence/201703/seriality-vs-synchronicity-kammerer-vs-jung|title=Seriality vs Synchronicity: Kammerer vs Jung|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Jung drew upon Kammerer's work in his book ''Synchronicity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koestler |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Koestler |title=The Roots of Coincidence |edition=hardcover |publisher=Random House |year=1972 |isbn=978-0-394-48038-1 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A coincidence lacks an apparent causal connection. A coincidence may be synchronicity, that being the experience of events that are causally unrelated, and yet their occurrence together has meaning for the person who observes them. To be counted as synchronicity, the events should be unlikely to occur together by chance, but this is questioned because there is usually a chance, no matter how small.

Some skeptics (e.g., [[Georges Charpak]] and [[Henri Broch]]) argue synchronicity is merely an instance of [[apophenia]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Todd Carroll, 2012, [http://www.skepdic.com/jung.html The Skeptic's Dictionary: synchronicity]&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that probability and statistical theory (exemplified, e.g., in [[Littlewood's law]]) suffice to explain remarkable coincidences.&lt;ref name=Charpak&gt;{{cite book|last=Charpak|first=Georges|title=Debunked!: ESP, telekinesis, and other pseudoscience|year=2004|publisher=Johns Hopkins Univ.

[[Charles Fort]] also compiled hundreds of accounts of interesting coincidences and anomalous phenomena.

==Causality==
Measuring the [[probability]] of a series of coincidences is the most common method of distinguishing a coincidence from causally connected events.

{{Quotation|The mathematically naive person seems to have a more acute awareness than the specialist of the basic paradox of probability theory, over which philosophers have puzzled ever since Pascal initiated that branch of science [in 1654] .... The paradox consists, loosely speaking, in the fact that probability theory is able to predict with uncanny precision the overall outcome of processes made up out of a large number of individual happenings, each of which in itself is unpredictable. In other words, we observe a large number of uncertainties producing a certainty, a large number of chance events creating a lawful total outcome.|Arthur Koestler, [[The Roots of Coincidence]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koestler |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Koestler |title=The Roots of Coincidence |page=25 |edition=hardcover |publisher=Random House |year=1972 |isbn=978-0-394-48038-1 |postscript= – 1973 Vintage paperback:}} {{isbn|0-394-71934-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To establish cause and effect (i.e., [[causality]]) is notoriously difficult, as is expressed by the commonly heard statement that "[[correlation does not imply causation]]." In [[statistics]], it is generally accepted that observational studies can give hints but can never establish cause and effect. But, considering the probability paradox (see Koestler's quote above), it appears that the larger the set of coincidences, the more certainty increases and the more it appears that there is some cause behind a remarkable coincidence.

{{Quotation| ... it is only the manipulation of uncertainty that interests us. We are not concerned with the matter that is uncertain. Thus we do not study the mechanism of rain; only whether it will rain.|[[Dennis Lindley]]'', "The Philosophy of Statistics," ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society|The Statistician]]'' (Series D, 2000)}}

{{Quotation|It is no great wonder if in long process of time, while [[Fortuna|fortune]] takes her course hither and thither, numerous coincidences should spontaneously occur.|[[Plutarch]]'', ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', vol. II, "Sertorius"}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5956">{{About|the concept of cultural pluralism|other uses of the term|Pluralism (disambiguation)}}
'''Cultural pluralism''' is a term used when smaller groups within a larger [[society]] maintain their unique [[Cultural identity|cultural identities]], and their [[value (personal and cultural)|values]] and practices are accepted by the wider culture provided they are consistent with the laws and values of the wider society. As a sociological term, the definition and description of cultural pluralism has evolved over time. It has been described as not only a fact but a societal goal.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Hazard and Madelon Stent, "Cultural Pluralism and Schooling: Some Preliminary Observations," Cultural Pluralism in Education: A Mandate for Change, eds. Madelon Stent, William R. Hazard and Harry N. Revlin (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1973), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural pluralism is distinct from (though often confused with) [[multiculturalism]]. Multiculturalism lacks the requirement of a dominant culture. If the dominant culture is weakened, societies can easily pass from cultural pluralism into multiculturalism without any intentional steps being taken by that society. If communities function separately from each other, or compete with one another, they are not considered culturally pluralistic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Cultural pluralism can be practiced at varying degrees by a group or an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Social and Cultural Pluralism as a Concept in Social System Analysis ;Marie R. Haug; Vol. 73, No. 3 (Nov., 1967), pp. 294-304; Published by: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent example of pluralism is 20th Century [[United States]], in which a dominant culture with strong elements of [[nationalism]], a sporting culture, and an artistic culture contained also smaller groups with their own ethnic, religious, and cultural norms {{Citation needed|date = July 2015}}. In 1971, the Canadian government referred to cultural pluralism, as opposed to multiculturalism, as the "very essence" of their nation's identity&lt;ref&gt;''Library and Archives Canada. Canada. Parliament. House of Commons. Debates, 28th Parliament, 3rd Session, Volume 8 (8 October 1971) ; [http://www.pier21.ca/research/immigration-history/canadian-multiculturalism-policy-1971 Canadian Multicultural Policy 1971]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; In a pluralist culture, groups not only co-exist side by side, but also consider qualities of other groups as traits worth having in the dominant culture. Pluralistic societies place strong expectations of [[Social integration|integration]] on members, rather than expectations of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. The existence of such institutions and practices is possible if the cultural communities are accepted by the larger society in a pluralist culture and sometimes require the protection of the law. Often the acceptance of a culture may require that the new or minority culture remove some aspects of their culture which is incompatible with the laws or values of the dominant culture.

The idea of cultural pluralism in the United States has its roots in the [[transcendentalist]] movement and was developed by [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosophers such as [[Horace Kallen]], [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]], and later thinkers such as [[Randolph Bourne]]. One of the most famous articulations of cultural pluralistic ideas can be found in Bourne's 1916 essay "Trans-National America".&lt;ref&gt;Science Encyclopedia [http://science.jrank.org/pages/10750/Pluralism-Cultural-Pluralism.html Cultural Pluralism] Retrieved on May 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher Horace Kallen is widely credited as being the originator of the concept of cultural pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;Horace M.

Young's work, in African studies, emphasizes the flexibility of the definition of cultural pluralism within a society.&lt;ref&gt;The Politics of Cultural Pluralism; Young, Crawford; The University of Wisconsin Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent advocates include moral and cultural anthropologist [[Richard Shweder]]. In 1976, an article in the ''Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare'' offered a redefinition of cultural pluralism in which it is described as a social condition in which communities of different cultures live together and function in an open system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Pantoja, Antonia; Perry, Wilhelmina; and Blourock, Barbara (1976) "Towards the Development of Theory: Cultural Pluralism Redefined," ''The Journal of Sociology &amp; Social Welfare'': Vol. 4: Iss. 1, Article 11.

'''Davina Delor''' (born 1952) is a French dancer, choreographer, writer, and famous for her popular TV show ''Gym Tonic'' who adopted monkhood as a [[Bhikkhuni|Buddhist nun]] in 2004 after meeting the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]]. After ordination, she changed her name to '''Gelek Drolkar.''' She converted her country home at [[Haims]] into a Buddhist monastery, and along with three other nuns, teaches [[Buddhism]] to students and lay persons. She has published a number of books on yoga and Buddhism, one of which is titled ''Le bonheur selon Bouddha'' (''The Happiness according to Buddha'') which explains the precepts of Buddhism.

==Biography==
Davina Delor was born in France in 1952.&lt;ref name=Gym&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20120519.AFP6617/davina-delor-de-gym-tonic-au-monastere-bouddhiste.html|title=Davina Delor, de "Gym Tonic" au monastère bouddhiste|language=French|date=19 May 2012|publisher= tempsreel.nouvelobs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her formative years in [[Haims]], a [[commune]] in the [[Vienne]] [[department (country subdivision)|department]] in the [[Poitou-Charentes]] [[region]] of western France, under the guidance of her mother, she was provided a Parisian Catholic religious education, and studied yoga and Hindu dance forms from India in addition to classical and contemporary dance.&lt;ref name=Gym/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yoga&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yogafestival.fr/view/content/intervenant/670-davina-gelek-drolkar?session=513auo5icjnnri6smnms2ku023|language=French|title= Davina Gelek Drolkar|accessdate=14 December 2015|publisher= yogafestival.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took up a career of dance, yoga, and creative gymnastics.&lt;ref name=Gym/&gt; Together with her friend Veronique de Villele, she presented a popular TV show titled ''Gym Tonic'' from 1981 to 1987, viewed by millions, and the two were known by their first names as ''les filles'' (the girls).&lt;ref name=Gym/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Television Quarterly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ia0LAQAAMAAJ|year=1983|publisher=National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Davina_Delor.jpg|right|thumb|Davina Delor or Gelek Drolkar]]

Concurrent with her career, she pursued studies in traditional [[Chinese medicine]] under the direction of Dr. Trinh Quan Ngoc and became a certified [[acupuncture|acupuncturist]] at the Asian Acupuncture Centre in Paris. She did research in [[psychopathology]] and graduated from the College of Health-Medicine and Human Biology of [[Paris 13 University|Paris XIII]] with a degree in alcoholism and drug addiction.&lt;ref name=Yoga/&gt;

Delor experienced personal tragedies. At age 17 her father committed suicide and in later years her son, aged 23, died of a ruptured [[aneurysm]].&lt;ref name=Gym/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pari&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parismatch.com/People/Television/Davina-apres-la-tele-le-Tibet-155054|title= Davina: après la télé, le Tibet|date=8 April 2012|accessdate=13 December 2015|publisher= parismatch.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Delor's career took a dramatic turn when she met the Dalai Lama, the spiritual head of Tibetan Buddhism at [[Bercy]] and was influenced by his teachings.&lt;ref name=Pari/&gt; She took her vows of celibacy at the 15th-century [[Golok Monastery]] in Tibet and became a nun in 2004 with the ordained name as Gelek Drolkar, in the [[Gelug]] order of Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref name=Yoga/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pari/&gt;

Following her Buddhist monastic conversion, Davina reformed her 18th-century home in Haims into a monastic centre and called it the Chökor Ling in 2007, with the objective of raising funds for helping poor children of Tibet and Tibetan families residing in India.&lt;ref name=Yoga/&gt; She started teaching the precepts of Tibetan Buddhism, meditation, and yoga to monks, students, and lay people, holding workshops and seminars. She is supported in this activity by three other nuns.

Delor has authored several books on [[yoga]] and the philosophy of Tibetan Buddhism.

'''Divine presence''', '''presence of God''', '''Inner God''', or simply '''presence''' is a concept in [[religion]], [[spirituality]], and [[theology]] that deals with the ability of a god or gods to be "[[wikt:present|present]]" with human beings.

According to some types of [[monotheism]] God is [[Omnipresence|omnipresent]].

==Conceptualizations==
The concept is shared by many religious traditions, is found in a number of independently derived conceptualizations, and each of these has culturally distinct terminology. Some of the various relevant concepts and terms are:
* [[Immanence]]–usually applied in [[monotheism|monotheistic]], [[Pantheism|pantheistic]], [[Pandeism|pandeistic]], or [[Panentheism|panentheistic]] faiths to suggest that the spiritual world permeates the [[Wikt:mundane|mundane]]. It is often contrasted with [[transcendence (religion)|transcendence]], in which the divine is seen to be outside the material world.
* [[Inward light|Inner light]]–term used in various religions to refer to the presence of God as a "light". The [[Religious Society of Friends]] regards this concept as a fundamental belief.
* [[Divine light]]–an aspect of divine presence with qualities of [[Light (theology)|illumination]]: thought, intellect, [[knowledge]], [[insight]], [[wisdom]], [[being]], [[divine love]].
* [[Numen]]–Latin term for "presence", used historically to refer to a Roman religious concept.
* [[Theophany]]–refers to the appearance of a [[deity]] to a human.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Theophany|publisher=''Encyclopædia Britannica'' |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/590940/theophany |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606014506/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/590940/theophany |archivedate=6 June 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Higher consciousness]]–is the consciousness of a higher Self, transcendental reality, or God.

==Abrahamic religions==

===Judaism===
* [[Angel of the Presence]]–refers to an entity variously considered angelic or else identified with God himself.
* [[Shekhinah]]–denotes the dwelling or settling of the divine presence of God and his cosmic glory.

===Christianity===
{{Christology}}
{{See also|Christology}}
* [[Immanuel]]–"God with us," is a Biblical concept that deals with the concept of divine presence, often used by Christians as a [[titles of Jesus|title for Jesus]]
* [[Incarnation (Christianity)]]–The belief that the second person of the [[Trinity]], also known as [[God the Son]] or the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] (Word), "[[incarnation|became flesh]]" by being conceived in the womb of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]].
* [[Presence of God (Catholicism)]]–refers to the belief that God is present by his Essence everywhere and in all things by reason of his Immensity. It also refers to the belief that God is in a special manner really and substantially present in the souls of the just.

[[Christian]]s generally recognize a special presence of Christ in the [[Eucharist]], although they differ about exactly how, where, and when Christ is present. While all agree that there is no perceptible change in the elements, some believe that they actually become the [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist|body and blood of Christ]], others believe the true body and blood of Christ are really present [[Sacramental union|in, with, and under]] the bread and wine which remain physically unchanged, others believe in a real but purely spiritual presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and still others take the act to be only a symbolic reenactment of the Last Supper.
* [[Consubstantiation]]–Lutheran concept of Christ being "infused" within the species of communion with these aspects still substantially present.
* [[Transubstantiation]]–Catholic and Orthodox (terminology differs) concept of Christ fully, truly and substantially present in the Eucharist with the physical species being substantially absent.

==Indian religions==
In [[Hinduism]], [[avatar]] refers to the appearance or [[incarnation]] of a [[deity]] on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Parrinder |authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|title=Avatar and Incarnation: The Divine in Human Form in the World's Religions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VkV5AAAAMAAJ |year=1997|publisher=Oneworld |isbn=978-1-85168-130-3|pages=19–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education''''' (ISSN 0972-2211) is published three times a year by [[Divyadaan: Salesian Institute of Philosophy, Nashik]], India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.divyadaan.org Divyadaan Organization]&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses mainly on philosophy, with interest also in the streams of education and communication, which are the two specializations offered by the Institute. The Institute is run by the Society of St Francis de Sales, also known as the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]], an international Catholic religious congregation whose primary mission is the education of young people, especially those who are disadvantaged. The congregation also interests itself in the welfare of middle- and working-class people, hence its interest in popular communication.

==Earlier names==
Originally entitled ''Divyadaan: A Philosophical Annual'', in 1995 it was renamed ''Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy'', and in 1996 ''Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education''. Articles are indexed in ''The Philosopher's Index''.

==Features==
Besides articles, the journal offers 'Dissertation Abstracts' (of doctoral dissertations in philosophy, education and communication published in the South Asia region) and 'Reviews and Notices'.

In 2009 (vol. 20/2) the journal began serializing [[Richard De Smet]]'s 'Guidelines in Indian Philosophy', which up to then had existed only in the form of cyclostyled notes for students at [[Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth|Jnana Deepa Vidyapeeth, Pune]].

'''Enduro/X''' is an [[open-source software|open-source]] [[middleware]] platform for distributed [[transaction processing]]. It is built on proven [[Application programming interface|APIs]] such as [[X/Open]] group's [[XATMI]] and [[X/Open XA|XA]]. The platform is designed for building real-time [[microservices]] based applications with a clusterization option. Enduro/X functions as an extended drop-in replacement for [[Oracle Tuxedo|Oracle (R) Tuxedo]] (R). The platform uses in-memory [[POSIX Kernel]] [[queue (software0)|queues]] which insures high [[interprocess communication]] throughput.

==Services==
The platform allows runtime system patching, without service interruption. The system monitors running processes, and restarts them after a crash or hang. System configuration can be dynamically reloaded and it provides a cluster facility, allowing two or more instances to be joined in peer-to-peer manner. Enduro/X is written in [[C (software)|C]] and provides native APIs for C/[[C++]].

==Technology==
Currently Enduro/X works on [[Linux kernel]]s starting from 2.6.12. The most critical Linux feature is epoll() on POSIX queues. This Linux functionality provides the mechanism for one queue - multiple servers, where Enduro/X servers are polling over the queues. Enduro/X developers pushed the [[EPOLLEXCLUSIVE]] flag inclusion into [[Linux]] kernel mainline (starting from version 4.5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patchwork epoll: add EPOLLEXCLUSIVE flag|url=https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/7793861|website=patchwork.kernel.org|publisher=Jason Baron}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patch improved the Enduro/X response in case if hundreds of executables are providing the same service. Particularly kernel is not doing thundering herd type behavior anymore by waking up all binaries waiting on queue. Now only single receiver of the service call is woken. In some workloads the Enduro/X applications gets significant boost. The test case for the patch increased the performance of the workload from the 860 seconds to 24 sec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPOLLEXCLUSIVE Linux Kernel patch testing|url=https://mvitolin.wordpress.com/2015/12/05/endurox-testing-epollexclusive-flag|website=mvitolin.wordpress.com|publisher=mvitolin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with Enduro/X version 3.1.2 production grade support for [[FreeBSD]], [[IBM AIX]] (versions 6.1 and 7.1) and [[Oracle Solaris]] V11 is added. V3.1.2 introduced experimental support for Apple [[macOS]] and [[Cygwin]]. Under Unix platforms where Posix queues are available, they are employed so that for every ATMI server/service pair there is separate queue open and caller service chooses queue in round robin mode. As for macOS there is no support for Posix queues in operating system, Enduro/X uses emulated Posix queues which are based on memory mapped files in tandem with Posix thread's process shared mutexes. For FreeBSD Posix queues can be polled too, thus Enduro/X on FreeBSD works in the say way as Linux with one queue-multiple servers. The polling on FreeBSD is done with help of [[kqueue]].

==Features==
* Standards based APIs - [[Service Component Architecture|SCA]], [[The Open Group]] XATMI
* Communication types - Synchronous, Asynchronous, Conversational, [[Publish/subscribe]]
* Typed buffers
** UBF (Unified Buffer Format) which provides emulation of Tuxedo's FML/FML32 format. UBF if high performance binary protocol buffer format. Buffer is indexed by binary search on fixed data types.
** STRING buffer format.
** CARRAY (byte array) buffer format.
** [[JSON]] buffer format, automatic conversion between JSON and UBF available.
** VIEW buffer (starting from version 5.0+). This offer C structure sending between processes in cross platform way. Also this allows to map UBF fields to VIEW fields, thus helping developer quicker to develop applications, by combining UBF and VIEW buffers.
* Transaction Management - Global Transactions - [[Two-phase commit protocol]] - [[X/Open XA]]
* Clustering - on peer-to-peer basis
* Event broker (also called publish and subscribe messaging)
* Security - Cluster link encryption with GNU [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] framework
* System process monitoring and self healing (pings and restarts)
* SOA Service cache. XATMI services can be cached to [[LMDB]] database. Resulting that next call to service from any local client receives results directly from cache (mainly from direct memory read). 
* Dynamic re-configuration
* Custom server polling extensions
* XATMI sub-system is able to work with out main application server daemon (ndrxd)
* Main application server daemon (ndrxd) can be restarted (if crashed). When started back it enters in learning mode for some period of time, in which in gathers information about system, what services are running, etc. After learning period, it starts to do normal operations
* Available tpforward() call
* ATMI server threads may become clients, and can do tpcall()
* ATMI call timeout reconfiguration via tptoutset() API call
* Extensive logging &amp; debugging. Enduro/X logging can be configured per binary with different log levels. As ATMI servers can be started outside of appserver, it is possible to debug them from programming IDE or with tools like  [[valgrind]].
* For quality assurance project uses automated unit-testing and integration-testing
* Built in ATMI service profiling.
* Environment variables can be updated for XATMI server processes with out full application reboot.
* Generic client process monitor (cpm). Subsystem allows to start/stop/monitor client executables. At client process crashes, cpm will start it back.
* Starting with version 5.2 Enduro/X provides configuration data encryption feature, so that software which is built on top of Enduro/X may comply with [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]] (PCI/DSS).

== Performance ==
Several benchmarks have been made with the Enduro/X middleware and it shows that it competes with [[Oracle Tuxedo]] and [[ZeroMQ]] quite well. Enduro/X was faster than Tuxedo 30% in 56 KB data block range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enduro/X VS Oracle Tuxedo performance benchmark|url=https://publicwork.wordpress.com/2016/09/02/endurox-vs-oracle-tuxedo-benchmark/|website=publicwork.wordpress.com|publisher=Publicwork}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enduro/X was significantly faster than ZeroMQ in 10-20KB range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High performance middleware wars: ZeroMQ vs Enduro/X benchmark|url=https://publicwork.wordpress.com/2016/07/17/endurox-vs-zeromq|website=publicwork.wordpress.com|publisher=Publicwork}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also for test performed with [[RabbitMQ]] Enduro/X showed it's strength and was ahead of the competitor. For the RPC calls, Enduro/X was several times ahead, for send only calls, RabbitMQ was bit closer to Enduro/X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enduro/X vs RabbitMQ review and benchmark|url=https://publicwork.wordpress.com/2018/06/22/enduro-x-vs-rabbitmq-review-and-benchmark/|website=publicwork.wordpress.com|publisher=Publicwork}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsystems ==
Enduro/X contains different sub-modules which extends the application server and middleware functionality.

===Queuing subsystem===
Enduro/X provides a queuing subsystem called TMQ (Transactional Message Queue). This facility provides persistent queues that allows applications to explicitly enqueue and dequeue messages from named queues. Queues can be ordered by message en-queue time in LIFO or FIFO order. Queues are managed by an XA compliant resource manager allowing queue operations to participate in distributed transactions. An automated queue forwarding feature is provided that will remove entries from a queue and invoke an associated Enduro/X ATMI services, placing the reply message on an associated reply queue and failed messages to failure queue.

===Configuration services===
Enduro/X offers applications to use [[ini file]] based configuration reading via special XATMI server, provided in package, named "cconfsrv". Basically via standard tpcall() user application is able to read configuration files (can be separate ini file or folder with them). Technique allows to use the sub-sections with key/value inheritance from main section.

===Trace logging services===
Enduro/X introduced new set of API function named tplog. This allows user to use the same C based high-performance debug logging facilities which Enduro/X uses internally. It is possible to redirect all logging by thread bases files. Also there are APIs for "request logging", which means that user and Enduro/X can do logging in separate files for each request (e.g. log by session id, log by username, etc.)

==Application Server for Go (ASG)==
ASG is bindings project on top of the Enduro/X. Authors considers these binding as application server for go, because Golang projects are linked statically and by default there is no such thing as components. Enduro/X allows to run separate executable binaries, which represents stateless services. These services can be reloaded on the fly without service interruption. Also platform allows to run distributed transaction processing by using Golang. Developers provides modified Oracle DB OCI8 drivers for Go, which supports XA transactions. Enduro/X ASG provides first ever distributed transaction facility for Golang.

==Enduro/X-PHP==
Full client bindings are available for [[PHP5]]. Client PHP processes might compile a loadable module or compile the Enduro/X process inside the PHP. When PHP process is running as client, it must be present in Enduro/X Application environment, that could be done when application is hosted under the same user where PHP app runs (Apache or so) or for the PHP user creating a micro environment which further connects to main application server via tpbridge process. Module is available here [https://github.com/endurox-dev/endurox-php].

==Enduro/X-Perl==
Client and server bindings are available for [[Perl]] scripting language. Perl module is available here [https://github.com/endurox-dev/endurox-perl].

==Acquisition==
The Enduro/X was acquired from ATR Baltic, Ltd by Mavimax Ltd on February, 2017 with full rights to the source code and current agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ATR Baltic's Enduro/X middleware Acquisition|url=https://www.mavimax.com/node/6|website=www.mavimax.com|publisher=Mavimax Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fontconfig''' (or '''fontconfig''') is a [[free software]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

|quote=Permission to use, copy, modify, distribute, and sell this software and its documentation for any purpose is hereby granted without fee, provided that the above copyright notice appear in all copies and that both that copyright notice and this permission notice appear in supporting documentation, and that the name of Keith Packard not be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the software without specific, written prior permission...
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[library (computer science)|program library]] designed to provide configuration, enumeration and [[font substitution|substitution]] of [[computer font|fonts]] to other programs. Fontconfig was originally written and maintained by [[Keith Packard]], and is currently maintained by [[Behdad Esfahbod]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/fontconfig/2009-June/003177.html|title=[Fontconfig] Fontconfig 2.7.0 released|work=freedesktop.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fontconfig is typically used on graphical [[Linux]] (and other [[Unix-like]]) desktops, where it remains an important part of handling fonts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://behdad.org/text/|title=State of Text Rendering|work=behdad.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is also sometimes used on other platforms, notably including [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] versions of software that use [[Pango]] for laying out and rendering text, such as [[GIMP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gimp.org/unix/fonts.html|title=GIMP - Fonts in GIMP|quote=Font configuration is handled by a small library called Fontconfig.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
[[End-user]]s can use fontconfig, directly or indirectly, to customize and configure fonts on the system.

Applications can use fontconfig in two ways:

# by querying it for the available fonts on the system, or
# by querying it for a font matching certain parameters (comprising a ''pattern'') as closely as possible.

To perform font matching, fontconfig stores typesetting information about all of the installed fonts, including the name of the [[font family]], style, weight, [[Dots per inch|DPI]], and [[Unicode]] coverage. This information is also used to perform [[font substitution]].

==Configuration==
Fontconfig uses [[XML]] format for its configuration files. The [[Document Type Definition]] (DTD) for fontconfig files is normally located at &lt;tt&gt;/etc/fonts/fonts.dtd&lt;/tt&gt;.

The master configuration file - usually &lt;tt&gt;/etc/fonts/fonts.conf&lt;/tt&gt; - references a few other configuration locations which may or may not exist:

* &lt;tt&gt;/etc/fonts/fonts.conf&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;/etc/fonts/conf.d&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig/conf.d&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig/fonts.conf&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;~/.fonts.conf.d&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;~/.fonts.conf&lt;/tt&gt;

A simple example of a configuration file:

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd"&gt;
&lt;fontconfig&gt;
    &lt;!-- Enable antialiasing for all fonts --&gt;
    &lt;match target="font"&gt;
        &lt;edit mode="assign" name="antialias"&gt;&lt;bool&gt;true&lt;/bool&gt;&lt;/edit&gt;
    &lt;/match&gt;
&lt;/fontconfig&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Utilities==
Fontconfig ships with eight command line utilities to manage and query fonts and the font configuration of the system:

* ''fc-list'': Lists all fonts fontconfig knows about or all fonts matching a pattern.
* ''fc-match'': Matches font-pattern (empty pattern by default) using the normal fontconfig matching rules to find the most appropriate font available.
* ''fc-cache'': Creates a [[cache (computing)|cache]] of all FreeType readable fonts in a specified directory or create a cache of all FreeType readable fonts from all directories specified in [[#Files|Configuration files]].
* ''fc-cat'': Reads the font information from cache files or related to font directories and emits it in [[ASCII]] form.
* ''fc-query'': Querys font files and reports resulting pattern(s).
* ''fc-scan'': Scans font files and directories and reports resulting pattern(s).
* ''fc-pattern'': Lists best font(s) matching the supplied pattern(s).
* ''fc-validate'': Validate font file(s) and reports the results.

'''Friedrich Samuel Bock''' ([[Königsberg]] 20 May 1716 – Königsberg 30 September 1785) was a German philosopher and [[Theology|theologian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manchester.edu/kant/bio/FullBio/BockFS.html This is a draft of an article in The Dictionary of Eighteenth Century German Philosophers], 3 vols., edited by Manfred Kuehn and Heiner Klemme (London/New York: Continuum, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1753 he was appointed first professor of Greek, then theology at the [[University of Königsberg]], though he resigned both positions in 1770 due to the University's failure to pay a salary, plus the onerous duty that the professor of Greek had to lecture on the whole of the New Testament annually.

He retained his previous position as university librarian, in all for twenty-seven years. It was in this position that Bock is associated with [[Immanuel Kant]] who was his assistant. At this period the library, or ''Schloßbibliothek'', was situated in two rooms in the castle.

==Works==
* ''Historia Antitrinitarianorum'' 1776. This enlarged work is the sum of a lifetime of interest in the theology of the [[Socinians]]. Bock's doctoral dissertation and also inaugural address for his theology position concerned the [[Polish Brethren]]. These were initially collected together and published as a history of [[Antitrinitarians]] in 1754.

'''Fun''' is the enjoyment of pleasure, particularly in [[leisure]] activities. Fun is an experience often unexpected, informal or purposeless. It is an enjoyable distraction, diverting the mind and body from any serious task or contributing an extra dimension to it. Although particularly associated with [[recreation]] and [[Play (activity)|play]], fun may be encountered during work, social functions, and even seemingly mundane activities of daily living. It may often have little to no logical basis, and [[opinions]] on whether an activity is fun may differ from person to person. A distinction between enjoyment and fun is difficult but possible to articulate, fun being a more spontaneous, playful, or active event. There are psychological and physiological implications to the experience of fun.

== Etymology and usage ==
The word ''fun'' is associated with sports, sex, entertaining media, high merriment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Nathan|title=An universal etymological English dictionary: comprehending the derivations ...|year=1775|publisher=R. Ware, W. Innys|pages=FU-FU|isbn=978-1-234-36393-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and amusement. Although its etymology is uncertain, it may be derived from ''fonne'' (fool) and ''fonnen'' (the one fooling the other).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andreyev|first=Judith|title=Wondering about Words: D'où Viennent Les Mots Anglais ?|year=2005|publisher=Bréal; BREAL|isbn=978-2749503059|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its meaning in 1727 was "cheat, trick, hoax", a meaning still retained in the phrase "to make fun of".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cousineau|first=Phil|title=The Painted Word: A Treasure Chest of Remarkable Words and Their Origins|year=2012|publisher=Cleis Press|isbn=978-1-936740-25-3|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation| ''The landlady was going to reply, but was prevented by the peace-making sergeant, sorely to the displeasure of Partridge, who was a great lover of what is called '''fun''', and a great promoter of those harmless quarrels which tend rather to the production of comical than tragical incidents.'' &lt;br /&gt;[[Henry Fielding]], ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling]]'' (1749)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fielding|first=Henry|title=The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|year= 1749|publisher=Penguin Books (1966)|pages=458 (Book 9, Ch.6)}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The way the word ''fun'' is used demonstrates its distinctive elusiveness and happiness. Expressions such as "Have fun!" and "That was fun!" indicate that fun is pleasant, personal, and to some extent unpredictable. Expressions such as "I was making fun of myself" convey the sense that fun is something that can be amusing and not to be taken seriously. The adjective "funny" has two meanings which often need to be clarified between a speaker and listener. One meaning is "amusing, jocular, droll" and the other meaning is "odd, quirky, peculiar". These differences indicate the evanescent and experiential nature of fun and the difficulty of distinguishing "fun" from "enjoyment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~dixa/papers/ECCE-fun-2004/ecce-alan-fun-panel.pdf |author=Alan Dix |title=Fun Systematically |accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fun's evanescence can be seen when an activity regarded as fun becomes goal-oriented. Many physical activities and individual sports are regarded as fun until the participant seeks to win a competition, at which point, much of the fun may disappear as the individual's focus tightens. Surfing is an example. If you are a "mellow soul" (not in a competition or engaging in extreme sport) "once you're riding waves, you're guaranteed to be having ... fun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alderson|first=Alf|title=Surfing: A Beginner's Guide|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Chichester, England|at=Preface|isbn=978-0-470-51654-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pleasure of fun can be seen by the numerous efforts to harness its positive associations. For example, there are many books on serious subjects, about skills such as music, mathematics and languages, normally quite difficult to master, which have "fun" added to the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matz|first=Carol|title=Famous &amp; Fun Classic Themes – 13 Appealing Arrangements for Early Elementary to Elementary Pianists|year=2003|publisher=Alfred Music Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Guzmán|first=Miguel|title=The Countingbury Tales: Fun With Mathematics|year=2000|publisher=World Scientific Publishing Company|location=River Edge, NJ, Covent Garden, London|isbn=981-02-4032-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Akiyama|first=Nobuo|title=Learn Japanese (Nihongo): The Fast and Fun Way|year=1999|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|isbn=0-7641-0623-6|author2=Carol Akiyama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
Many physical activities provide opportunities to play and have fun. Not only can these activities be fun but can also improve physical and mental states.

According to [[Johan Huizinga]], fun is "an absolutely primary category of life, familiar to everybody at a glance right down to the animal level."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bruce C.

It has been suggested that games, toys, and activities perceived as fun are often challenging in some way. When a person is challenged to think consciously, overcome challenge and learn something new, they are more likely to enjoy a new experience and view it as fun. A change from routine activities appears to be at the core of this perception, since people spend much of a typical day engaged in activities that are routine and require limited conscious thinking. Routine information is processed by the brain as a "chunked pattern": "We rarely look at the real world", according to game designer [[Raph Koster]], "we instead recognize something we have chunked, and leave it at that. [...] One might argue that the essence of much of art is in forcing us to see things as they really are rather than as we assume them to be".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koster|first=Raph|authorlink=Raph Koster|title=Theory of Fun for Game Design|year=2010|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4493-1497-2|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it helps people to relax, fun is sometimes regarded as a "social lubricant", important in adding "to one's pleasure in life" and helping to "act as a buffer against stress".&lt;ref name=Urdang&gt;{{cite book|last=Urdang|first=Esther|title=Human Behavior in the Social Environment: Interweaving the Inner and Outer Worlds|year=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-7890-3417-5|pages=445|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For children, fun is strongly related to play and they have great capacity to extract the fun from it in a spontaneous and inventive way. Play "involves the capacity to have fun – to be able to return, at least for a little while, to [[Neverland|never-never land]] and enjoy it."&lt;ref name=Urdang /&gt;

== Physiology ==
Some scientists have identified areas of the brain associated with the perception of novelty, which are stimulated when faced with "unusual or surprising circumstances". Information is initially received in the [[hippocampus]], the site of long-term memory consolidation, where the brain attempts to match the new information with recognizable patterns stored in long-term memory. When it is unable to do this, the brain releases [[dopamine]], a chemical which stimulates the [[amygdala]], the site of emotion, and creates a pleasurable feeling that is associated with the new memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sprenger|first=Marilee B.|title=The Leadership Brain For Dummies|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-60005-4|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, fun is created by stimulating the brain with novelty.

== In popular culture ==
In the modern world, fun is sold as a consumer product in the form of games, novelties, television, toys and other amusements. [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist]] sociologists such as the [[Frankfurt School]] criticise mass-manufactured fun as too calculated and empty to be fully satisfying. [[Bill Griffith]] satirises this [[dysphoria]] when his cartoon character [[Zippy the Pinhead]] asks mechanically, "Are we having fun yet?" In the [[Beatles]] song "[[She's Leaving Home]]" fun is called "the one thing that money can't buy."&lt;ref name=Sem&gt;{{citation |chapter=The Semantics of Fun |author=Mark Blythe, Marc Hassnzahl |pages=91–100 |title=Funology |publisher=Springer |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-4020-2966-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gabriel Kenneth Cousens''' (born May 14, 1943) is an American physician M.D., [[homeopath]], and spiritual writer who practices [[holistic health|holistic medicine]]. In 1976 Cousens legally changed his name from '''Kenneth Gabriel Cousens''' to '''Gabriel Kenneth Cousens'''. Cousens advocates [[raw foodism|live foods therapy]], a [[nutritional]] regimen which he says can cure [[diabetes]],&lt;ref name="GNA"&gt;[http://www.ghananewsagency.org/details/Health/Diabetes-is-curable-Dr-Cousens/?ci=1&amp;ai=31891 "Diabetes is curable - Dr Cousens"].

He is the founder of the "Essene Order of Light", a spiritual organization based upon teachings from the Jewish [[Kabbalah]], the [[Torah]], and modern interpretations of the [[Essenes]]. The Essenes are a mystical group from the second century B.C.E. who lived in community, eschewed materialism and grew their own food. The modern Essene movement was founded by [[Edmond Bordeaux Szekely]], a religious scholar who promoted a simple holistic lifestyle of meditation and raw vegan eating and published several books on the Essenes in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schneider|first1=Claire|title=The echanted gardener|agency=San Diego Jewish Journal|issue=February 2004|date=February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essene Order of Light is taught by Cousens at "Tree of Life Foundation", an organization directed by Cousens and headquartered at its "Tree of Life Rejuvenation Center" in [[Patagonia, Arizona]].&lt;ref name="Melton"&gt;[[J.

'''Gabriel Wagner''' (c. 1660 – c. 1717)  was a radical German philosopher and [[Materialism|materialist]] who wrote under the [[Pen name|nom-de-plume]] '''Realis de Vienna.''' A follower of [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and acquaintance of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], Wagner did not believe that the universe or bible were divine creations, and sought to extricate philosophy and science from the influence of [[theology]]. Wagner also held radical political views critical of the [[nobility]] and [[monarchy]]. After failing to establish lasting careers in cities throughout German-speaking Europe, Wagner died in or shortly after 1717.

==Life==

[[Image:Christian Thomasius.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Christian Thomasius]], an early mentor and later opponent of Wagner.]]
Wagner studied under scholar [[Christian Thomasius]] in [[Leipzig]], and in 1691 published a philosophical tract critical of Thomasius, "Discourse and doubts in Christ: a Thomasian introduction to courtly philosophy."&lt;ref name=dascal&gt;Dascal, 2008, pp.490-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=israel06&gt;Israel, 2006, pp.173-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The tract satirically dubbed Thomasius the "German [[Socrates]]" and attracted attention within philosophical circles, including from Leibniz, who sought to contact Wagner.&lt;ref name=dascal /&gt; In the same year, after a dispute over rent, Wagner was expelled from university and imprisoned. Following his release, Wagner traveled in 1693 to [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], where as a result of his increasingly [[libertine]] views he wholly broke with Thomasius, who by contrast was becoming more conservative.&lt;ref name=dascal /&gt;&lt;ref name=israel06 /&gt; Moving to [[Berlin]] later in 1693 and then to [[Vienna]], Wagner was in 1696 given a temporary position in [[Hamburg]],&lt;ref name=israel06 /&gt; which he lost due to his novel and sometimes polemical philosophical positions.&lt;ref name=dascal /&gt;

Receiving support from Leibniz, Wagner worked for a time at the [[Herzog August Library]] in [[Wolfenbüttel]];&lt;ref name=israel06 /&gt; and maintained his contact with Leibniz.&lt;ref name=poser290&gt;Poser, 2004, pp.290-291&lt;/ref&gt;  Leibniz wrote to Wagner in 1696, describing his admiration for [[Aristotle]] and opposing contemporary attacks on him, despite his view that Aristotle had discovered only a small portion of the discipline.&lt;ref name=cass&gt;Cassirer, 1943, pp.383-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposing his former mentor Thomasius' belief in the [[soul]], Wagner published another text in 1707, "Critique of Thomasian views on the nature of the soul." Theologian [[Johann Joachim Lange]] accused Wagner of Spinozist sympathies in 1710, and Wagner replied to these criticisms in the same year.&lt;ref name=israel06 /&gt;

The last record of Wagner is found in [[Göttingen]] in 1717, where he came into conflict with historian of philosophy Christoph August Heumann. Wagner presumably died shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=israel06 /&gt;

==Philosophy==

[[File:Korespondencja Gottfrieda Leibniza.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Correspondence of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], who maintained contact with Wagner for much of his life.]]
Wagner believed that both education and philosophy should be modernized and focus on mathematics, physics and medicine, but not theology.&lt;ref name=israel06 /&gt; In this regard he held that Germany had made more progress, while French, Italian and Spanish thinkers were overly influenced by followers of [[Aristotle]], [[Galen]] and [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref name=israel06 /&gt; Believing in intellectual freedom, Wagner was an admirer of German philosopher and professor [[Nicolaus Hieronymus Gundling]], who favored "atheistic" classical Greek philosophy.&lt;ref name=israel06 /&gt;

As articulated in his 1707 critique of Thomasius, Wagner did not believe in a soul, in divine providence, in the divinity of the bible, or in divine creation. He instead advocated reason, the most "godly" aspect of humankind, as a means of eradicating superstition. Wagner therefore celebrated advances in science facilitated by [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and even considered himself a Cartesian, though he disagreed with the latter's Christian [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] beliefs and even sought to undermine them.&lt;ref name=israel06 /&gt;&lt;ref name=israel07&gt;Israel, 2007, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=erdmann1890&gt;Erdmann, 1890, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; Deeply influenced by Spinoza, Wagner placed even greater emphasis on the importance of experimentation and empiricism in developing knowledge.

Wagner held radical political beliefs, advocating a restructuring of society according to more egalitarian principles and advocating greater emphasis on administration, education and culture.&lt;ref name=israel335&gt;Israel, 2006, pp.335-7&lt;/ref&gt; Reform of educational institutions was a particular concern of his writing.&lt;ref name=israel07b&gt;Israel, 2007, pp.6-7&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner contested that aristocracy by birth was inferior to intellectual achievement. He also believed that Germany's fragmentary political system resulted in a weak and mismanaged government.&lt;ref name=israel06 /&gt; In these beliefs Wagner was influenced by but disagreed with political thinkers such as [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]. Much of Wagner's political and philosophical system was oriented, ultimately, towards securing religious, intellectual, and personal freedom, a project of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] as a whole.&lt;ref name=israel335 /&gt;

==Legacy==

[[File:Baruch de Spinoza cover portrait.jpg|thumb|220px|right|An early engraving of the philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], a major influence on Wagner's world view.]]
Wagner is known for his longstanding correspondence with Leibniz, and his erudition and innovative understanding of philosophy and natural sciences during his time, according to historian Cornelio Fabro.&lt;ref name=fabro&gt;Fabro, 1968, p.598&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Jonathan Israel]] writes that Wagner is an important materialist philosopher of the late 17th and early 18th centuries, and an example of both radical philosophy and atheism produced by the growing university system of the period.&lt;ref name=israel43&gt;Israel, 2006, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=israel167&gt;Israel, 2006, pp.167-8&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Frederick Beiser writes that Wagner and his fellow materialists in Germany, though they were less numerous than those found in France and England, developed mechanistic explanations for human behavior and raised fears of spreading religious skepticism.&lt;ref name=beiser&gt;Beiser, 2000, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''Herbert James Paton''' [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] [[FSA Scot]] (30 March 1887 – 2 August 1969), usually cited as '''H. J. Paton''', was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[philosopher]] who taught at various university institutions, including [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. He worked in British intelligence during the two world wars and played a diplomatic role on behalf of [[Poland]] at the 1919 [[Versailles conference]]. In 1968, the year before his death, he published ''The Claim of Scotland'', a plea for greater general understanding of the constitutional position of his own native country.

==Early life and education==
Paton was born in [[Abernethy, Perth and Kinross|Abernethy]]. He was the son of the Reverend William Macalister Paton and Jean Robertson Millar.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who, 1965'', London, A. &amp; C. Black, 1965, p. 2363.&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the [[High School of Glasgow]], the [[University of Glasgow]], and [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. At Oxford he gained a First in Classical Moderations, 1909, and a First in Literae Humaniores ('Greats', a combination of philosophy and ancient history) in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford University Calendar 1911'', Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1913, 189, 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service in the wars==
During the [[First World War]] Paton served in the [[Admiralty]]'s Intelligence Division, 1914–1919, and became an expert on Polish affairs in which capacity he attended the [[Versailles conference]] in 1919. At the Peace Conference he was the brains behind the [[Curzon Line]].  Drawn across eastern [[Poland]], the line marked to the west of it what [[Lord Curzon]], the British Foreign Secretary, would guarantee as Poland for the Poles.  It was breached by the [[German-Russian Steel Pact]] of 28 September 1939, that prevented Russians from assisting Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Foot, SOE, p.230&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World]] War Paton did government work in the [[Political Intelligence Department (1939–1943)|Foreign Research and Press Service]] (after 1943 the Foreign Office Research Department), 1939–44. He was also a member of the Executive Committee of the [[League of Nations Union]], 1939–48.

==Academic career==
From 1911 to 1927 Paton was Fellow and Praelector in Classics and Philosophy at [[The Queen's College, Oxford|Queen's College]], and Dean of the College, 1917–22.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who, 1965'', London, A. &amp; C. Black, 1965, p. 2363.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 he served as Junior Proctor at Oxford. He spent a sabbtical year in the [[United States of America]], 1926-26, where he was [[Laura Spelman Rockefeller]] Research Fellow, [[University of California]].&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who, 1965'', London, A. &amp; C. Black, 1965, p.2363.&lt;/ref&gt; There he wrote his first philosophy book, ''The Good Will''.&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Walsh, 'Herbert James Paton', ''Proceedings of the British Academy, 1970'', London : Oxford University Press, 1972, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; The year after his return to Oxford he resigned his Queen's Fellowship to take up the post of Professor of Logic and Rhetoric at the University of Glasgow, 1927–37.&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Walsh, 'Herbert James Paton', ''Proceedings of the British Academy, 1970'', London : Oxford University Press, 1972, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Oxford as White's Professor of Moral Philosophy (1937–52), a post which carried with it a Fellowship at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]].&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who, 1965'', London, A. &amp; C.

Paton was a notable [[Kant]]ian scholar; in this he abandoned his earlier attraction to the [[idealist]] philosophy of [[Benedetto Croce]] (1866-1952).&lt;ref&gt;W. H. Walsh, 'Herbert James Paton', ''Proceedings of the British Academy, 1970'', London : Oxford University Press, 1972, pp.294, 297.&lt;/ref&gt; His works of Kantian commentary included ''Kant's Metaphysics of Experience'' (1936), ''The Categorical Imperative'' (1947), and ''The Moral Law'' (a translation of Kant's ''Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten'' [Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals], 1785] (1947). Paton delivered the [[Gifford Lectures]] at the [[University of St Andrews]], 1949–50; the lectures were published as ''The Modern Predicament'' (1955).

==Cultural politics==
In his final years Paton published ''The Claim of Scotland'' (1968), a considered dissection of national sensitivities between [[Scotland]] and [[England]] under the [[Treaty of Union]], in which he articulated a robust yet peaceable call for greater general understanding of Scotland's [[sovereignty|sovereign]] rights. The book cites in particular the period in the early 1950s when [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament in London]] effectively ignored the [[Scottish Covenant]] of 1949.

==Personal life==
Paton married twice, the first time in 1936 to Mary Sheila (d. 1959), daughter of Henry Paul Todd-Naylor. His second marriage was with Sarah Irene (d. 1964), daughter of Professor [[William Macneile Dixon]]. He died on August 2, 1969 in [[Perth and Kinross]].

'''''Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois''''', {{ussc|431|720|1977}} was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case on [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]] which established that indirect purchasers of goods or services along a supply chain cannot seek remedy for [[antitrust]] actions committed by the manufacturer or service provider, leaving this option only reserved for direct purchasers. The decision in this case has become known as the "Illinois Brick doctrine" used to determine who has [[Case or Controversy Clause|Article III standing]] to bring antitrust charges against companies.

==Background==
In the early 1970s, the United States government filed both civil and criminal charges against eleven [[Concrete masonry unit|concrete brick]] manufacturers in Chicago, stating that they were engaging in [[price fixing]]. The defendants pleaded ''[[nolo contendere]]'' and entered into a settlement with the government. 

Spurred by this, the government of Illinois filed a new suit at the eleven concrete brick manufacturers, asserting they were engaged in conspiratorial price-fixing for bricks to be used for government construction, violating the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], and seeking treble damage. The defendants sought to have the case dismissed as the government were not direct purchasers of the bricks. In general, these companies sold bricks directly to masonry contractors for them to complete jobs given to them by [[general contractor]]s during the construction of new buildings; the defendants stated that the government, in paying for the construction of these buildings, were not the ones purchasing the bricks themselves. The district court agreed, citing both the Supreme Court ruling of ''Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp.'' ({{ussc|392|481|1968|el=no}}) that emphasized that direct purchases of goods have the right to sue manufacturers for anti-trust, and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit]]'s decision in ''Commonwealth Edison v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co.'' (315 F.2d 564, 567) that determined that the ultimate consumers of goods along a supply chain were "too remote and [in]consequential to provide legal standing to sue against the alleged antitrust violator". 

The state appealed to the Seventh Circuit, which overturned the district court's ruling, arguing that the Sherman Act allows for any person that was harmed by antitrust behaviors may bring suit for triple damages. ([https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1910166399232658727 536 F.2d 1163]). The brick manufacturers petitioned to the Supreme Court for writ of certorari, which was granted. Oral arguments were heard on March 23, 1977 with the decision given on June 9, 1977.

==Judgment==
In a 6-3 decision, The Supreme Court held that indirect victims of a price fixing conspiracy had no standing to sue for antitrust violations for raised prices. The majority opinion was written by Justice [[Byron White]], joined by Justices [[Warren Burger]], [[Potter Stewart]], [[Lewis F. Powell Jr.|Lewis Powell]], [[William Rehnquist]], and [[John Paul Stevens]]. It held that if an indirect purchaser of overpriced goods could sue, then it would open the door to “multiple recovery”. An overcharge might be collected if more than one entity in the chain of distribution of the product could recover for the same violation. White was concerned with the Court making a significant overrule to their previous decision in ''Hanover Shoe''.

Justice [[William J. Brennan Jr.|William Brennan]] wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices [[Thurgood Marshall]] and [[Harry Blackmun]]. Brennan wrote that the majority's approach to stay consistent with ''Hanover Shoe'' undercut the strength of the language that Congress had written into the Sherman Act. Justice Blackmun also wrote a dissenting opinion, arguing the case's close timing with ''Hanover'' likely impacted the result; if ''Hanover'' had not been decided, the courts would have likely ruled in favor of the state government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11635537603314405616&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exceptions==
Two exceptions to the direct purchaser rule are potentially recognized in various jurisdictions: the control exception and the preexisting cost-plus contract exception.

The control exception, noted in footnote 16 of the Illinois Brick opinion, states that in some situations an indirect purchaser might maintain an antitrust action where the direct purchases is owned or controlled by its customer.  This exception is narrowly construed and limited to situations where the relationship involves a functional or economic unity between the direct and indirect purchaser such that there has been effectively one sale.  See Jewish Hospital Association v. Stewart Mechanical Enterprise, Inc., 628 F.2d 971 (6th Cir. 1980).

The preexisting cost-plus contract exception states that an indirect purchaser may have standing where the all costs initially borne by the direct purchaser are passed on to the indirect purchaser pursuant to a preexisting cost-plus contract between the parties.  In such situation, the overcharging is not absorbed by the direct purchaser but is instead passed on to the indirect purchaser. See Illinois v. Panhandle E. Pipe Line Co. 852 F.2d 891 (7th Cir 1988).

==Significance==
Many state antitrust laws reject the ''Illinois Brick'' doctrine. Thus, in ''California v. ARC America Corp.'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/490/93/case.html Justia], 490 U.S. 93 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court rejected arguments that ''Illinois Brick'' preempted broader state antitrust laws such as that of California, which rejected the doctrine.

A 2007 Antitrust Modernization Commission Report proposed that Congress should abandon the ''Illinois Brick'' doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;The Antitrust Modernization Commission was created pursuant to the Antitrust Modernization Commission Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-273, §§ 11051-60, 116 Stat. 1856. The Commission submitted its Report and Recommendations to Congress and the President on April 2, 2007. The Report and other documents relating to its work are found at its website—http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/amc/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal, if adopted, would weaken the federal right of action for direct purchasers by reviving as a defense the fact that the direct purchaser had passed on the overcharge instead of absorbing it, while creating a federal right of action for indirect purchasers. Federal rights of action under the proposal would not be exclusive, but state law claims would be subject to expanded federal jurisdiction to allow consolidation of all claims from a price fix in a single court for both discovery and trial. All recoveries in the consolidated actions would be limited to the initial overcharge, trebled.

The applicability of ''Illinios Brick'' towards digital marketplaces is expected to be the subject of the pending Supreme Court case, ''[[Apple Inc. v. Pepper]]'', to be heard in the 2018 term, which relates to whether consumers of third-party mobile applications through a marketplace can bring anti-trust actions against the owner of the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17479480/supreme-court-apple-vs-pepper-antitrust-lawsuit-standing-explainer | title = What happens if Apple loses its Supreme Court App Store antitrust appeal? |first = Adi | last = Robertson | date = June 20, 2018 | accessdate = June 20, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5063">'''Ioan Zalomit''' (1823–1885) was a [[Romania]]n philosopher, professor and [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[University of Bucharest]].

== Biography ==

Ioan Zalomit was born in [[Bucharest]], in a family of merchants. His parents were probably of [[Greeks|Greek]] origin, but they were born in [[Wallachia]].

He began his education in private schools, probably French, and achieved his formation in France,  at the [[University of Paris]] and later in Germany, at the [[University of Berlin]]. He obtained the title of doctor of philosophy at this later university, in 1848, with a dissertation on [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s philosophy.

Zalomit began teaching philosophy at the [[Saint Sava Academy]]. When the University of Bucharest was established, in 1864, he was appointed Professor of philosophy at the Faculty of Letters. He held the office of rector of the university between May 1871 - April 1885. In 1882 he became a member of the ''Permanent Council of Public Instruction'', and in 1885 he was elected vice-president of this institution.

==Philosophical contributions==

Like other translators, Zalomit contributed to the creation of a modern Romanian philosophical terminology and to the diffusion of philosophical ideas in the Romanian society. The textbook of Antoine Charma (1801–1869) that he translated introduced in Romania the [[eclecticism]] of [[Victor Cousin]], whose disciple Charma was. This work proposed the following disciplinary division of the philosophy: psychology, logic, morals, theodicy and history of philosophy. By means of the translation of Charma's handbook, Zalomit introduces for the first time in Romania the history of philosophy as a philosophical discipline.

His dissertation from 1848 is the first exegesis of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s philosophy written by a Romanian. Although the [[Kantianism]] was at that time known to Romanians from different courses and textbooks (of [[Daniil Philippidis]], [[Gheorghe Lazăr]], [[Eufrosin Poteca]], [[Eftimie Murgu]], [[August Treboniu Laurian]], [[Simeon Bărnuţiu]], and of course that of Zalomit himself), there were still no monographs on this subject. Zalomit places Kant in the historical context of the modern philosophy, presenting the main figures of the empiricist and rationalist traditions. He considers that Kant is a spiritual successor of [[Descartes]], and that he accomplished the program set forth, but unrealised, by Descartes.

Ioan Zalomit offers in his dissertation a criticism of Kant, on several topics. For example, he criticises the epistemological preeminence that Kant assigns to the visual sense, arguing that touching has to be at least as important as seeing for the knowledge of the exterior world, since the category of substance is practically inseparable from this sense. He argues next that Kant did not critically analysed the three ideas of the pure reason, which, in his opinion, are nothing but distinct applications of the idea of infinite, or of Absolute, and can therefore be reduced to this idea. Next, he makes the point that, speaking of things-in-themselves, Kant crosses the limits of his own philosophy.

Zalomit considers that the greatest difficulty of Kant's philosophy is the distinction between nature and liberty. He thinks that this separation can not be maintained, and he argues that an identification of nature and liberty is not to be feared. The moral laws can not be harmed by this, because liberty is natural, it is inherent to the notion of nature. Thus, the moral precepts could be regarded as duties of the nature. By this naturalisation of the liberty Zalomit wanted to save the "true harmony of the natural things", the "true organism of the Universe", in order to save both human liberty and the validity of the concept of [[Divine Providence]]. This Christian and organicist conception testifies of the influence that the [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] had on his world-view, but also of his knowledge of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]]'s philosophy of nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1052">In [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]], it is the job of the {{Nihongo|'''jikidō'''|直堂|}} to run the [[zendo]] according to the rules prescribed by the teacher, and maintain the zendo's schedule. The jikido makes a commitment to run every regularly scheduled sitting and each monthly sesshin. In [[Sōtō]] the jikido is the one person, other than the Teacher, who faces outward in the zendo instead of facing the wall. This is because the jikido's practice cannot be simply private or inward, but must always face outward, aware and responsive to what's going on in the zendo. The jikido's job is not just to facilitate the functioning of the zendo, the jikido embodies and exemplifies practice as functioning. And that is the functioning of no-self – of the forgotten self – that responds to each thing in turn, performs each function in turn without a thought of right or wrong or ''how am I doing'' or ''how do I look doing it''.

'''John Earle Raven''' (13 December 1914 – 5 March 1980), who published as '''J. E. Raven''', was an [[English people|English]] [[classical scholar]], notable for his work on [[presocratic philosophy]], and amateur [[botanist]].

==Early life and education==
John Raven was born on 13 December 1914 in [[Cambridge]],&lt;ref name="CPC"&gt;[https://archive.is/20120719090221/http://www.aristarchus.unige.it/cphcl/schede.php?word=nt Catalogus Philologorum Classicorum]&lt;/ref&gt; the son of [[Charles E. Raven|Charles Earle Raven]], sometime [[Regius Professor of Divinity|Regius Professor of Divinity at Cambridge]] and Master of [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] and of Margaret Wollaston. His mother's family endowed Raven with a distinguished intellectual pedigree, including between 1723 and 1829 seven [[Fellow of the Royal Society|Fellows of the Royal Society]] (among them [[Charlton Wollaston]], [[Francis Wollaston (scientist)|Francis Wollaston (1694-1774)]], [[Francis Wollaston (priest and astronomer)|Francis Wollaston (1762-1823)]], [[George Wollaston]] and [[William Hyde Wollaston]]); Raven was also a 7th generation descendant of [[William Wollaston]], the philosophical writer. On his father's side, he was related to [[Samuel Hole]], [[Dean of Rochester]].&lt;ref&gt;Raven, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Raven was educated at [[St Ronan's School]], then situated at [[Worthing (district)|Worthing]], before proceeding in September 1928 with a [[scholarship]] to [[Marlborough College]], where he distinguished himself academically, winning prizes in [[English (language)|English]] [[poetry|verse]], [[Greek (language)|Greek]] [[Iamb (foot)|iambics]], Greek and [[Latin (language)|Latin]] [[prose]] and Latin verse, culminating in a scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He did not confine himself to the intellectual, playing in the First XV at [[rugby union|rugby]] and setting new school records in 1934 for the [[high jump]] and 440 yards.&lt;ref&gt;Raven, Op. cit., Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the award of a [[first class degree]] in [[classics]] at Trinity&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/sabbagh-rum.html A Rum Affair: How Botany's "Piltdown Man" was Unmasked] by Karl Sabbagh, The Penguin Press 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-7139-9277-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raven became in 1946 a [[research fellow]] there. In October 1948 he was elected a [[fellow]] of [[King's College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref name="Watsonia"&gt;[http://www.watsonia.org.uk/25_1_PrestonRaven.pdf "John Raven’s report on his visit to the Hebrides", 1948] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726103205/http://www.watsonia.org.uk/25_1_PrestonRaven.pdf |date=26 July 2011 }} edited by C. D. Preston, ''Watsonia''; 25: 17–44 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; a position he held until his retirement in 1984.

During the [[Second World War]] he was a [[conscientious objector]],&lt;ref name ="Andrew Raven obituary"&gt;[http://boards.ancestry.com/topics.obits/36824/mb.ashx?pnt=1 Obituary of Andrew Raven], ''The Daily Telegraph''; 5 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; basing his case on arguments by [[Plato]]. He undertook unsalaried social work for [[Guy Clutton-Brock]] at [[Oxford House (settlement)|Oxford House]] in [[Bethnal Green]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0272%2FPP%2FJER King's College Archive: Papers relating to John Earle Raven]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical scholar==
As a classical scholar, Raven's interests were in [[ancient philosophy]]. In 1957 he published with [[Geoffrey Kirk]] ''The Pre-Socratic philosophers'', a standard work for [[undergraduates]] still in use today. Raven contributed the chapters relating to the Italian tradition ([[Pythagoras of Samos]], [[Alcmaeon of Croton]], Pre-Parmenidean [[Pythagoreanism]], [[Parmenides of Elea]], [[Zeno of Elea]], [[Melissus of Samos]], [[Philolaus of Croton]] and [[Eurytus (Pythagorean)|Eurytus of Croton]]) and on [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Archelaus (philosopher)|Archelaus]].

As Senior Tutor at King's in the 1960s he turned the college to the [[Left-wing politics|left]], telling [[Public school (UK)|public schools]] that their boys could no longer expect to "swan in", as previously.&lt;ref name ="Andrew Raven obituary"/&gt;

Raven was the undergraduate tutor of [[Myles Burnyeat]], who subsequently became the fifth [[Laurence Professor of Ancient Philosophy]] at Cambridge University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n04/burn02_.html Book review by M.F. Burnyeat], [[London Review of Books]], 22 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Botanist: The Heslop-Harrison fraud==
While Raven's principal professional occupation was his career as a classical scholar, he applied a similar intellectual rigour to his amateur interest in botany.
  
From the mid-1930s [[John Heslop-Harrison]], Professor of Botany at [[Former colleges of Durham University|King's College, Newcastle upon Tyne]], had reported significant new plant discoveries on expeditions to the [[Inner Hebrides|Inner]] and [[Outer Hebrides]]. The sheer scale of the discoveries aroused scepticism, and in 1948 Raven secured a grant from Trinity College to fund a trip to [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]] and [[Rùm]] in July and August of that year to investigate the claims of Heslop-Harrison.&lt;ref name ="Watsonia"/&gt;

Raven's conclusions about two of the notable species were published, briefly, in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']]. He suggested that both ''[[Carex bicolor]]'' and ''[[Polycarpon tetraphyllum]]'' were introductions to Rùm, but did not comment on the possible means of introduction. His full report of the expedition and fraud was deposited in the library of King's College, Cambridge on 5 May 1960, to attack Prof. Jack Heslop-Harrison's electron microscope research into plant genetics (DNA) and only published in full in 1999 after the deaths of both Heslop-Harrison, his son [[Jack Heslop-Harrison]] and Raven himself. In the report Raven alleged that at some time in the 1940s Heslop Harrison transported alien plants to the Isle of Rum and planted them in the soil; he then "discovered" the plants, claimed they were indigenous to the area and that he was the first to find them. Raven's report to the council of Trinity College states: "In the interests not only of truth but also of the reputation of British science it is essential somehow to discover what plants and what insects he (Heslop Harrison) has either completely fabricated or else deliberately introduced into the Hebrides."&lt;ref name ="Watsonia"/&gt;

'''Jongmyo''' is a [[Confucianism|Confucian]] shrine dedicated to the perpetuation of memorial services for the deceased kings and queens of the Korean [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392–1897).  According to [[UNESCO]], the shrine is the oldest royal Confucian shrine preserved and the ritual ceremonies continue a tradition established in the 14th century.  Such shrines existed during the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period (57-668), but these have not survived.  The Jongmyo Shrine was added to the UNESCO [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]] list in 1995.

Jongmyo is adjacent to [[Changdeokgung]] and [[Changgyeonggung]] in the south. They used to be connected in the Joseon period, but were separated by a road built by Japanese colonialists. Nowadays there is a construction plan to recover the original structure of the shrine.

The main buildings of Jongmyo was constructed in October, 1394 when [[Taejo of Joseon|Taejo]], first king of [[Joseon Dynasty]], moved the capital to Seoul. It was destroyed by fire in the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)]], then rebuilt in 1608.

==History==
When it was built in 1394 by order of [[Taejo of Joseon|King Taejo]], the Jongmyo Shrine was thought to be one of the longest buildings in Asia, if not the longest. The main hall, known as ''Jeongjeon'', had seven rooms.  Each room was reserved for a king and his queen.  The complex was expanded by [[Sejong of Joseon|King Sejong]] (r. 1418–50) who ordered the construction of ''Yeongnyeongjeon'' (Hall of Eternal Comfort).  This practice of expansion continued, with the growth of the complex moving from west to east, because of the need to house more memorial tablets during the reigns of later kings until there were a total of 19 rooms.  However, during the [[Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea|Seven-Year War]] (1592–98), Japanese invaders burned down the original shrine and a new complex was constructed in 1601 and has survived to this day.  The original tablets were saved in the invasion by hiding them in the house of a commoner and also survive. [http://www.orientalarchitecture.com/seoul/jongmyoindex.htm].  A king's tablets were enshrined three years after his death. There are 19 memorial tablets of kings and 30 of their queens, placed in the 19 chambers. Each room is very simple and plain in design.  Only two kings' memorial tablets are not enshrined here.[http://www.lifeinkorea.com/Travel2/77]. In addition to the tablet, there is a panel listing each king's accomplishments.

The current ''Jeongjeon'' is [[National treasures of South Korea|National treasure of Korea]] No. 227 and is the longest building in Korea of traditional design.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060517100716/http://www.lifeinkorea.com/Travel2/77].

==Description==
Viewed from the king's throne at [[Gyeongbokgung]] Palace, Jongmyo Shrine would have been on the king's left while the [[Sajik Shrine]], another important Confucian shrine, was on the right. This arrangement was derived from Chinese practice.  The main halls are surrounded by hills.  In front of the main hall is the ''Woldae'' Courtyard, which is 150 meters in length and 100 meters in width.

The south entrance gate was reserved for spirits to enter and exit, the east gate was for the king, and the west gate was for the performers of the royal ritual.[https://web.archive.org/web/20051224080341/http://media.graniteschools.org/Curriculum/korea/confucian.htm].

The Jongmyo Shrine is divided into 15 main parts.

==Rituals and performances==
{{see also|Jongmyo Jerye#Jerye-ak}}
[[File:Korean Royal Ancestral Ritual Music-Jongmyo Jeryeak-01.jpg|thumb|Performance of ''Jongmyo jeryeak'', May 2007.]]
An elaborate performance of ancient court music (with accompanying dance) known as ''Jongmyo jeryeak'' (hangul: 종묘제례악; hanja: 宗廟祭禮樂) is performed there each year for the ''[[Jongmyo jerye]]'' ritual.  Musicians, dancers, and scholars would perform Confucian rituals, such as the Jongmyo Daeje (Royal Shrine Ritual) in the courtyard five times a year.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20060517100716/http://www.lifeinkorea.com/Travel2/77]. Today the rituals have been reconstructed and revived. The Jongmyo Daeje has been designated as [[Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea|Important Intangible Cultural Property]] No. 56 and is performed every year on the first Sunday in May.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20060517100716/http://www.lifeinkorea.com/Travel2/77].  The ''Jongmyo Jerye-ak'', the traditional court music of Joseon, is performed by the Royal Court Orchestra and has been designated as [[Important Intangible Cultural Properties of South Korea|Important Intangible Cultural Property of South Korea]] No. 1.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060517100716/http://www.lifeinkorea.com/Travel2/77]. This court music has its origins in Chinese court music that was brought to Korea during the [[Goryeo]] period (918-1392). [http://www.lifeinkorea.com/cgi-bin/pictures.cfm?FileName=perform8].  King Sejong composed new music for the ritual based largely on ''[[hyangak]]'' (with some ''[[dangak]]'') in 1447 and 1462.  [http://www.lifeinkorea.com/cgi-bin/pictures.cfm?FileName=perform8].

The songs invite the ancestral spirits to descend from heaven to enjoy the kings achievements in founding the dynasty and defending the country in order to encourage their descendants to follow in their footsteps.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Today the members of the Jeonju Yi Royal Family Association perform the rites to the accompaniment of music and dance provided by musicians from the National Center for Korean Traditional Performing Arts and dancers from the Gukak National High School&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guide to Korean Culture|last=Korean Culture and Information Service|publisher=Hollym|year=2010|location=13-13 Gwancheol-dong, Jongno-gu, Seul 110-11 Korea|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2333">'''Geir Arne Olsen''' (1957 - 1990), better known under his pen-name '''Leonard Borgzinner''', was a Norwegian essayist, self-taught political philosopher, science fiction author, illustrator and [[fanzine]] editor. Borgzinner is most noted for his many contributions to the alternative culture magazine ''[[Gateavisa]]'' and for his two books, a collection of science fiction and fantasy stories, ''Universets varmedød og andre selvmord'' (1981; "The Heat-Death of the Universe and other Suicides") and a collection of essays in political philosophy, ''Anarki og adel: elementer til en kulturrevolusjon'' (1998; "Anarchy and Nobility: Elements towards a Cultural Revolution"). As an illustrator he was known for his often satirical drawings for fanzines and underground publications, including some comic strips. His fanzine production in the late 1970s, still partly under the name of Geir Arne Olsen, spanned both science fiction [[fandom]] and the [[Punk subculture|punk music world]], the former in the fanzines ''TRALFA'' and ''The Borgzinner Medicine Show'', and the latter most notably in the two published issues of ''666'', published in opposition to the Norwegian punk establishment. Influences on his work included [[Pre-Socratic philosophy]], [[Marquis de Sade]], [[anarchism]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[New Wave (science fiction)|new wave science fiction]], [[Samuel R. Delany]], [[Yukio Mishima]] and [[Michel Foucault]].

He has been translated into French.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noosfere.com/heberg/ericb33/Biblio.asp?RevNum=3404] Bibliographie Leonard Borgzinner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19735">{{Gnosticism}} 
The '''Marcosians''' were a [[Gnostic]] sect founded by [[Marcus (Marcosian)|Marcus]], active in [[Lyon, France]] and southern [[Europe]] from the second to the 4th century. Women held special status in the Marcosian communities; they were regarded as [[prophet]]esses and participated in administering the [[Eucharist]]ic rites.  [[Irenaeus]] accuses Marcus of seducing his followers, and scornfully writes (''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus Haereses]]'' I. 13, 4) that the whole sect was an affair of "silly women."

The Marcosian system was a variation of that of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]]. It retained the 30 [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Aeon]]s, but called them "Greatnesses" and gave them numerical values. It kept the myth of the fall of [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]] but called it a "Divine Deficiency". Unique to it was the adaptation of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] number theory ([[Isopsephy]]) to Gnosticism.

==System==
Marcus holds his knowledge to be the product of a divine revelation of the body of the [[Aeon (Gnosticism)#Anthropos|Anthropos]]:

{{quote|The infinitely exalted ''[[Tetrad (Greek philosophy)|Tetrad]]'' descended upon him from the invisible and indescribable places in the form of a woman .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. and expounded to him alone its own nature, and the origin of all things, which it had never before revealed to any one either of gods or men. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. [and] said:—I wish to show thee Aletheia (Truth) herself; for I have brought her down from the dwellings above, that thou mayest see her without a veil, and understand her beauty—that thou mayest also hear her speaking, and admire her wisdom. Behold, then, her head on high, ''[[Alpha]]'' and ''[[Omega]];'' her neck, ''[[Beta]]'' and ''[[Psi (letter)|Psi]];'' her shoulders with her hands, ''[[Gamma]]'' and ''[[Chi (letter)|Chi]];'' her breast, ''[[Delta (letter)|Delta]]'' and ''[[Phi]];'' her diaphragm, ''[[Epsilon]]'' and ''[[Upsilon]];'' her back, ''[[Zeta]]'' and ''[[Tau]];'' her belly, ''[[Eta]]'' and ''[[Sigma]];'' her thighs, ''[[Theta]]'' and ''[[Rho]];'' her knees, ''[[Iota]]'' and ''[[Pi]];'' her legs, ''[[Kappa]]'' and ''[[Omicron]];'' her ankles, ''[[Lambda]]'' and ''[[Xi (letter)|Xi]];'' her feet, ''[[Mu (letter)|Mu]]'' and ''[[Nu (letter)|Nu]]''. Such is the body of Truth, according to this magician, such the figure of the element, such the character of the letter. And he calls this element Anthropos (Man), and says that is the fountain of all speech, and the beginning of all sound, and the expression of all that is unspeakable, and the mouth of the silent [[Aeon (Gnosticism)#Sige|Sige]].|[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XIV.|I. 14, 1-3]]}}

===Theory of letters===
Sometimes Marcus counts the number of letters in a name, sometimes he reckons up the sum total, when to each letter is given its value in the Greek arithmetical notation: sometimes he uses a method which enables him to find still deeper mysteries.

Marcus points out that if we take a single letter, Δ, and write its name at full length, δέλτα, we get five letters; but we may write again the names of these at full length and get a number of letters more, and so on ''ad infinitum''. If the mysteries contained in a single letter be thus infinite, what must be the immensity of those contained in the name of the Propator.

Concerning this name he gives the following account:—When the first Father, who is above thought and without substance, willed the unspeakable to become spoken, and the invisible to become formed, He opened His mouth and emitted a Word like Himself, which being the form of the invisible, declared to Himself what He was. His name consisted of four syllables successively uttered, of four, four, ten, and twelve letters respectively.

It might appear as if we were to understand as the first of these the word ἀρχή; and this name of four syllables and thirty letters seems to correspond to a description of the system of thirty Aeons divided into two Tetrads, a Decad, and a Dodecad. Each letter is one of the Aeons, and contains within itself an infinity of mysteries. Each letter makes its own sound, it knows not the sound of the adjacent letter, nor of the whole, but the restitution of all things will take place when all the letters are brought to make the same sound, and then a harmony will result of which we have an image in that made when we all sound the ''[[Amen]]'' together.

This comparison shows an interesting point of agreement in [[liturgy|liturgical]] usage between the Gnostics of the 2nd century and the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman church]] of the time of [[Jerome]], whose well-known words are "ad similitudinem caelestis tonitrui Amen reboat." What is stated about the limited knowledge of each [[Aeon]] may be compared with what [[Hippolytus of Rome]] tells of the [[Docetae]] (viii. 10).

===Tetrad===
[[Image:Tetrad.svg|thumb|200px|The Pythagorean Tetrad.&lt;ref&gt;Hemenway, Priya. ''Divine Proportion: Phi In Art, Nature, and Science''. Sterling Publishing Company Inc., 2005. {{ISBN|1-4027-3522-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Marcus pushes into further details his designation of the Aeons as letters of the alphabet. There are twenty-four letters in the alphabet, and twenty-four is the sum of the letters of the names of the first tetrad: 
*The Unspeakable (ἄῤῥητος)
*Silence (σειγή)
*Father (πατήρ)
*Truth (ἀλήθεια)

Followed by those of the second tetrad:

*[[Logos|Word]] (λόγος)
*Life (ζωή)
*Man (ἄνθρωπος)
*[[Aeon (Gnosticism)#Ecclesia|Church]] (ἐκκλησία)

These form the [[Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|Ogdoad]]. Again, the [[Greek alphabet]] consists of nine mutes, eight semivowels, and seven vowels. The [[Silent letter|mutes]] belong to Father and Truth (The Unspeakable, and Silence, of course, do not count); these being mute reveal nothing to man. The [[semivowels]] belong to Word and Life, but the [[vowels]] to Man and Church, since it was a voice coming through Man which gave power to all.

For the [[seven heavens]], we are told, utter each its own vowel sound, the first A and so on; and it was the sound of their united doxology borne to the earth, which gave generation to all things on the earth. By the descent of Him who was with the Father from the nine into the seven, the groups of Aeons were equalized and perfect harmony produced.

===Ἰησοῦς===
Further, it is to be observed that in the Greek arithmetical notation eight letters are used to denote units, eight tens, and eight hundreds: total 888; but this is exactly the numerical value of the letters in the name Ἰησοῦς. Similarly, the Α and Ω is identified with the περιστερά which descended on Jesus, the numerical value being in both cases 801.

Other mysteries are found in the six letters of the name Ἰησοῦς (see ''Episemon'', below), the eight letters of χρειστός, which again added to the four of Υίος make twelve. These, however, are only the spoken names known to ordinary Christians; the unspoken names of Jesus and Christ are of twenty-four and thirty letters respectively. Either Hippolytus, or an early copyist of his, makes an attempt to solve the mystery of the unspoken names by writing at full length the letters of the name χρειστός; χεῖ, ῥώ, εἴ, ἰῶτα, σίγμα, ταῦ, οὐ, σάν; but we have here only twenty-four letters instead of thirty, so we must be content to remain in ignorance of what would seem to have been one of the most valuable secrets of this sect.

===Aeons===
To understand the generation of the thirty Aeons from the Ogdoad, we have only to take the first eight numbers and add them up, leaving out six—for it is the [[Digamma|Episemon]] and not a letter of the usual Greek alphabet:—
&lt;blockquote&gt;1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 8 = 30&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Again, we find the fall of the twelfth Aeon, Sophia, indicated in the alphabet; for Λ, which arithmetically denotes 30, the number of the Aeons, is only the eleventh letter in the alphabet. But it set about to seek another like itself, and so the next letter is M, or ΛΛ. Again, add up the numerical value of all the letters of the alphabet ending with λ and we have ninety-nine; that is deficiency, a number still counted on the left hand, which they who have "knowledge" escape by following after the one which, added to ninety-nine, transfers them to the right hand. The reader will remember [[Juvenal]]'s "jam dextera computat annos."

===Episemon===
Even numbers are female, odd numbers male, by the union of the first of these, 2 and 3, was begotten the Episemon, or 6, the number of Salvation.

In the account of his system given by Irenaeus (I. xiv.), copied by Hippolytus (''Ref''. vi. 45) and by Epiphanius (''Haer''. 34), τὸ ἐπίσημον is repeatedly used to denote the numerical character for six; the number 6 is ὁ ἐπίσημος ἀριθμός; the six-lettered name Ἰησοῦς is τὸ ἐπίσημον ὄνομα, etc., language perplexing to the old Latin translator, who renders the word by "insignis."
A similar use of the word is found in [[Clement of Alexandria]] (''Strom''. vi. 16); but this cannot be called a quite independent illustration, for the coincidences are found to be such as to put it beyond doubt that Clement, in his account of the mysteries of the number 6, makes unacknowledged use of the same writings of Marcus as were employed by Irenaeus. [[Eusebius]] (''Quaest. ad Marin''. Mai, ''Nov. Pat. Bib''. iv. 299), copied by [[Jerome]] or Pseudo-Jerome (''Brev. in Psal''. 77, vii. 198, ed. Vallars.), suggests, as a way of reconciling the difference between the evangelists as to whether the Lord suffered at the third or the sixth hour, that a transcriber's error may have arisen from the likeness of Gamma and the Episemon, ''i.e.'' apparently Γ and Ϝ.

The source whence all modern writers have learned their use of the word episemon is [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]]'s essay on the origin of the Ionic letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink= Joseph Justus Scaliger|last=Scaliger|first=Joseph Justus|title=Anim. in Chron. Euseb|pages=110–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; He there quotes as from [[Bede]], ''de Indigitatione'', a statement of an old grammarian, who, having mentioned that the Greeks denote numbers by letters, and for this purpose join to the letters of their alphabet three other characters, goes on as follows:—
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Prima est ς quae dicitur Episimon et est nota numeri VI.; secunda est G quae vocatur kophe et valet in numero XC.; tertia est ϡ quae dicitur enneacosia quia valent DCCCC.''&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Here, as well as in the preceding passages, episemon is used with special reference to the character for six; but Scaliger turns into Greek the phrase "nota numeri VI." τὸ ἐπίσημον τοῦ ἑξ ἀριθμοῦ, and seems to have inferred that the marks for the numbers 90 and 900 had equal rights to the same title; and he also gives the name Episemon to each of the six [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician letters]] said not to have been received by the [[Ionia]]ns, saying, for instance, that the letter ἧτα  was originally an episemon, and distinguishing between the episemon of the number 6 and the digamma or episemon of Vau. He does not name his authority for this way of speaking; nor do we know that the character which was by some called βαῦ, and by others τὸ ἐπίσημον, was ever called by any one before Scaliger by the combination ἐπίσημον βαῦ. However this may be, Scaliger has been followed by all who have written on the subject since his time.

The true account of these three characters seems to be that though the Phoenicians themselves did not use the letters of their alphabet for purposes of numeration, the Greeks, who derived their alphabet from them, did so in the 5th century BC; that their alphabet then still contained two of the Phoenician letters which in the next century were disused, viz., βαῦ in the sixth place, and κόππα, the Roman Q, coming after π; that these letters then took their natural place in the system of numeration, which was afterwards made complete by the addition, at the end of the letters of the alphabet, of another character to denote 900, which from its shape was at a considerably later period called σανπῖ.&lt;ref&gt;Hankel, ''Geschichte der Mathematik'', p. 34; Kirchhoff, ''Studien zur Geschichte des gr. Alphab''.&lt;/ref&gt; The character for six had not come to be identified with the abbreviation for στ in the time of Marcus, as known through Hippolytus. In calculating the numerical value of χρειστός he counts the σ and τ separately; and it is to be noted that he calls the former ''s'' [[Sigma]], and the latter [[San (letter)|San]]. It is possible that Marcus expressly identified his episemon with the digamma, for though in Irenaeus, the reading is undoubtedly διπλο γράμματα, the context gives probability to Dr. Hort's conjecture that Marcus wrote γάμματα. He says that this number added to the number of the twenty-four letters makes thirty. Now the double letters are already included in the twenty-four, but the Digamma stands outside the alphabet, and therefore its number might properly be added to that of the letters.

===Six===
With regard to the properties of the number 6, Marcus and Clement were in part indebted to [[Philo of Alexandria]], who explains (''De Op. Mund''. 3) that it is the first perfect number, ''i.e.'', according to [[Euclid]]'s definition, one equal to the sum of the numbers 1, 2, 3 which divide it without remainder ([[Augustine|Aug]]. ''[[City of God (book)|de Civ. Dei]]'', xi. 30), the second such number being 28, which is the sum of its divisors 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 (''Orig. t.'' 28 in ''S. Joann''.); that being 2 × 3 it arises from the marriage of a male and female, ''i.e.'', odd and even number; that there are six directions of motion, forward, backward, right, left, up, down; etc. Marcus observed that 
* The world was made in ''six'' days
* In the new dispensation Jesus after ''six'' days went up to the [[Mount of Transfiguration]]
* There, by the appearance of [[Moses]] and [[Elijah]], the number of His company became ''six''
* He suffered at the ''sixth'' hour of the ''sixth'' day of the week
And thence concludes that this number has the power not only of production, but of regeneration. As seven is the number of the heavens, and eight is the supercelestial ogdoad, so six denotes the material creation (see also [[Heracleon]]); and, in particular, the material body through which the Saviour revealed Himself to men's senses, and conveyed to them that enlightenment of their ignorance in which redemption consisted. Clement, if not Marcus, finds the Saviour's higher nature represented by the episemon, which is not taken into account by one who looks merely at the order of the letters in the alphabet, but reveals itself in the system of numeration.

Irenaeus points out that the mysteries of Marcus all depend on the employment of the modern form of the Greek alphabet, and that they disappear when a [[Semitic alphabet]] is used. He shows also (ii. 24) that it is possible to say as fine things about the properties of the number 5 as about those of the numbers which are glorified by Marcus.

==Practices==
{{main|Valentinianism}}
The Marcosians had formulae and sacraments of redemption. If so great mysteries were contained in names, it naturally followed that to know the right name of each celestial power was a matter of vital importance; and such knowledge the teachers promised to bestow. Others held that these applications could not procure spiritual redemption—only by knowledge (''gnosis'') could such redemption be effected.

===Baptism and Trinitarian Baptismal Formula===
[[Eusebius of Caesarea]] writes that the Marcosians baptised people "Into the name of the unknown father of the universe, into truth, the mother of all things, into the one that descended upon Jesus."&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius of Caesarea, ''Ecclesiastical History'' iv. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This may show that the Trinitarian baptismal formula existed at least at that time, and probably earlier,&lt;ref&gt;St. Justin Martyr, ''1st Apology'' lxi.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Marcosians adopted it as their own.
  
Marcus taught that the [[baptism]] of the visible [[Jesus]] was but for the forgiveness of sins, but that the redemption of [[Christ]], who in that [[baptism of Jesus|baptism]] descended, was for perfection; the one was merely psychical, the other spiritual. Of the latter are interpreted the words in which Jesus spoke of another baptism ({{bibleverse|Luke||12:50}}; {{bibleverse|Matthew||20:22}}).

Some conferred this redemption by baptism with special invocations; others went so far as to reject Christian baptism and to substitute a mixture of oil and water which they poured over the head of the candidate. By confirmation the Gnostics intended not so much to give the Holy Ghost as to seal the candidates against the attacks of the [[archon (Gnosticism)|Archons]], by which the initiated would after death become incomprehensible and invisible, and leaving their bodies in this lower creation and their [[souls]] with the [[Demiurge]], ascend in their spirits to the [[Pleroma]]. Probably the Egyptian religion contributed this element to Gnosticism. Some of these Marcosian formulae were in Hebrew, of which Irenaeus has preserved specimens much corrupted by copyists.

===Eucharist===
A knowledge of [[astrology]] was among Marcus's accomplishments, and apparently some chemical knowledge, with which he gained a reputation of magical skill. The [[eucharist]]ic cup of mingled wine and water was seen under his invocation to change to a purple red; and his disciples were told that this was because the great ''[[Aeon (Gnosticism)#Charis|Charis]]'' (Grace) had dropped some of her blood into the cup. Sometimes he would hand the cup to women, and bid them in his presence pronounce the eucharistic words:

{{quote|May that Charis who is before all things, and who transcends all knowledge and speech, fill thine inner being, and multiply in thee her own knowledge, by sowing the grain of mustard seed in thee as in good soil.|[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XIII.|I. 13, 2]]}}

Then he would pour from their consecrated cup into a much larger one held by himself, and the liquor, miraculously increased at this prayer, would be seen to rise up and fill the larger vessel.

===Prophecy===
Marcus taught his female disciples to [[prophecy|prophesy]]. [[Sortition|Casting lots]] at their meetings, he would command her on whom the lot fell boldly to utter the words which were suggested to her mind, and such words were accepted by the hearers as prophetic utterances.

He was Named as "Non-Linear Optimization's Father". In a speech at IUT university he was announced that the exams on Tuesdays are forbidden and it may cause crashes in the stars. As a mathematician, he is most notable for his work on the classification and solution of [[cubic equation]]s, where he provided geometric solutions by the intersection of [[conics]].&lt;ref name=mactutor&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id= Khayyam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khayyam also contributed to the understanding of the [[parallel axiom]].&lt;ref name="Struik"&gt;Struik, D.

There is a tradition of attributing [[Persian poetry|poetry]] to Omar Khayyam, written in the form of [[quatrain]]s (''[[Ruba'i|rubāʿiyāt]]'' {{lang|fa|رباعیات|rtl=yes}}). This poetry became widely known to the English-reading world in a translation by [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]] (''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'', 1859), which enjoyed great success in the [[Orientalism]] of the [[fin de siècle]].

==Life==
Omar Khayyam was born in [[Nishapur]], a leading metropolis in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] during medieval times that reached its climax of prosperity in the eleventh century under the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq dynasty]].&lt;ref name = "Sarton"&gt;''The Tomb of Omar Khayyâm'', George Sarton, '''Isis''', Vol. 29, No. 1 (Jul., 1938), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}&lt;ref&gt;Edward FitzGerald, ''Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'', Ed. Christopher Decker, (University of Virginia Press, 1997), xv;"The Saljuq Turks had invaded the province of Khorasan in the 1030s, and the city of Nishapur surrendered to them voluntarily in 1038. Thus Omar Khayyam grew to maturity during the first of the several alien dynasties that would rule Iran until the twentieth century.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Avery and John Heath-Stubbs, ''The Ruba'iyat of Omar Khayyam'', (Penguin Group, 1981), 14;"These dates, 1048-1031, tell us that Khayyam lived when the Saljuq Turkish Sultans were extending and consolidating their power over Persia and when the effects of this power were particularly felt in Nishapur, Khayyam's birthplace.&lt;/ref&gt; Nishapur was then religiously a major center of [[Zoroastrians]]. It is likely that Khayyam's father was a Zoroastrian who had converted to Islam.&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom"&gt;Mehdi Aminrazavi, ''The Wine of Wisdom: The Life, Poetry and Philosophy of Omar Khayyam'', [[Oneworld Publications]] (2007){{unreliable source?|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|68}} He was born into a family of tent-makers (''Khayyam''). His full name, as it appears in the Arabic sources, was ''Abu’l Fath Omar ibn Ibrāhīm al-Khayyām''.&lt;ref&gt;in e.g.  [[Al-Qifti]]  (Aminrazavi 2007:55) or [[Abu'l-Hasan Bayhaqi]]. (E. D. R., &amp; H. A. R. G. (1929:436).&lt;/ref&gt;
In medieval Persian texts he is usually simply called ''Omar Khayyām''.&lt;ref&gt;Frye (1975:658); e.g. in [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] (Browne 1899:409f) or in ''Munis al-ahrār'' (Ross 1927:436).&lt;/ref&gt;
The historian [[Abu'l-Hasan Bayhaqi|Bayhaqi]], who was personally acquainted with Omar, provides the full details of his horoscope: "he was Gemini, the sun and Mercury being in the ascendant[...]".&lt;ref name="Earliest Account of Khayyam"&gt;E. D. R., &amp; H. A. R. G. (1929). The Earliest Account of 'Umar Khayyām. Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies, University of London, 5(3), 467-473.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|471}} This was used by modern scholars to establish his date of birth as 18 May 1048.&lt;ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" /&gt;{{rp|658}}

His boyhood was passed in Nishapur.&lt;ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" /&gt;{{rp|659}} His gifts were recognized by his early tutors who sent him to study under Imam Muwaffaq Nīshābūrī, the greatest teacher of the Khorasan region who tutored the children of the highest nobility.&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" /&gt;{{rp|20}} In 1073, at the age of twenty-six, he entered the service of [[Sultan]] [[Malik-Shah I]] as an adviser. In 1076 Khayyam was invited to [[Isfahan]] by the [[vizier]] and political figure [[Nizam al-Mulk]] to take advantage of the libraries and centers in learning there. His years in Isfahan were productive. It was at this time that he began to study the work of Greek mathematicians [[Euclid]] and [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]] much more closely. But after the death of Malik-Shah and his vizier (presumably by the [[Assassins]]' sect), Omar had fallen from favour at court, and as a result, he soon set out on his [[Hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]]. A possible ulterior motive for his pilgrimage reported by [[Al-Qifti]], is that he was attacked by the clergy for his apparent skepticism. So he decided to perform his pilgrimage as a way of demonstrating his faith and freeing himself from all suspicion of unorthodoxy.&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" /&gt;{{rp|29}} He was then invited by the new [[Sultan Sanjar]] to [[Merv|Marv]], possibly to work as a court [[astrologer]].&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428267/Omar-Khayyam |title=Omar Khayyam (Persian poet and astronomer) |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later allowed to return to Nishapur owing to his declining health. Upon his return, he seemed to have lived the life of a recluse.&lt;ref name="Great Muslim Mathematicians"&gt;Great Muslim Mathematicians. Penerbit UTM (July 2000): Mohaini Mohamed&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|99}} Khayyam died in 1131, and is buried in the [[Mausoleum of Omar Khayyám|Khayyam Garden]].

==Mathematics==
[[File:Khayyam-paper-1stpage.png|thumb|"Cubic equation and intersection of conic sections" the first page of two-chaptered manuscript kept in Tehran University.]]

Khayyam was famous during his life as a [[mathematician]]. His surviving mathematical works include: ''A commentary on the difficulties concerning the postulates of Euclid's Elements'' ({{lang|ar|Risāla fī šarḥ mā aškala min muṣādarāt kitāb Uqlīdis}}, completed in December 1077&lt;ref name="Iranica Online" /&gt;), ''On the division of a [[Quadrant (circle)|quadrant of a circle]]'' ({{lang|ar|Risālah fī qismah rub‘ al-dā’irah}}, undated but completed prior to the treatise on algebra&lt;ref name="Iranica Online" /&gt;), and ''On proofs for problems concerning Algebra'' ({{lang|ar-Latn|Maqāla fi l-jabr wa l-muqābala}}, most likely completed in 1079&lt;ref name="Struik" /&gt;{{rp|281}}). He furthermore wrote a treatise on extracting the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; root of natural numbers, which has been lost.&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" /&gt;{{rp|197}}

===Theory of parallels===
{{See also|Non-Euclidean geometry#History|Parallel postulate#History|l1=History of non-Euclidean geometry|l2=Parallel postulate}}
A part of Khayyam's commentary on Euclid's Elements deals with the [[parallel axiom]].&lt;ref name="Struik" /&gt;{{rp|282}} The treatise of Khayyam can be considered the first treatment of the axiom not based on [[petitio principii]], but on a more intuitive postulate. Khayyam refutes the previous attempts by other mathematicians to ''prove'' the proposition, mainly on grounds that each of them had postulated something that was by no means easier to admit than the Fifth Postulate itself.&lt;ref name="Iranica Online" /&gt; Drawing upon [[Aristotle]]'s views, he rejects the usage of movement in geometry and therefore dismisses the different attempt by [[Ibn al-Haytham|Al-Haytham]].&lt;ref name=rozenfeld-ch2&gt;{{harv|Rozenfeld|1988|pp=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=katz&gt;{{harv|Katz|1998|p=270}}. Excerpt: ''In some sense, his treatment was better than ibn al-Haytham's because he explicitly formulated a new postulate to replace Euclid's rather than have the latter hidden in a new definition.''&lt;/ref&gt; Unsatisfied with the failure of mathematicians to prove Euclid's statement from his other postulates, Omar tried to connect the axiom with the Fourth Postulate, which states that all right angles are equal to one another.&lt;ref name="Struik" /&gt;{{rp|282}}

Khayyam was the first to consider the three cases of acute, obtuse, and right angle for the summit angles of a [[Saccheri quadrilateral|Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral]], three cases which are exhaustive and pairwise mutually exclusive.&lt;ref name="Struik" /&gt;{{rp|283}} After proving a number of theorems about them, he proved that the Postulate V is a consequence of the right angle hypothesis, and refuted the obtuse and acute cases as self-contradictory.&lt;ref name="Iranica Online" /&gt; Khayyam's elaborate attempt to prove the parallel postulate was significant for the further development of geometry, as it clearly shows the possibility of non-Euclidean geometries. The hypothesis of the acute, obtuse, and that of the right angle are now known to lead respectively to the non-Euclidean [[hyperbolic geometry]] of Gauss-Bolyai-Lobachevsky, to that of [[Riemannian geometry]], and to [[Euclidean geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;Rolwing, R., &amp; Levine, M. (1969). THE PARALLEL POSTULATE. The Mathematics Teacher, 62(8), 665-669.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi|Tusi]]'s commentaries on Khayyam's treatment of parallels made its way to Europe. [[John Wallis]], the professor of geometry at Oxford, translated Tusi's commentary into Latin. Jesuit geometrician [[Girolamo Saccheri]], whose work (''euclides ab omni naevo vindicatus'', 1733) is generally considered as the first step in the eventual development of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], was familiar with the work of Wallis. The American historian of mathematics, [[David Eugene Smith]] mentions that Saccheri "used the same lemma as the one of Tusi, even lettering the figure in precisely the same way and using the lemma for the same purpose". He further says that "Tusi distinctly states that it is due to Omar Khayyam, and from the text, it seems clear that the latter was his inspirer."&lt;ref name="Great Muslim Mathematicians" /&gt;{{rp|104}}&lt;ref&gt;Smith, David, 1935, "Euclid, Omar Khayyam and Saccheri," Scripta Mathematica.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" /&gt;{{rp|195}}

====The real number concept====
This treatise on Euclid contains another contribution dealing with the [[Proportionality (mathematics)|theory of proportions]] and with the compounding of ratios. Khayyam discusses the relationship between the concept of ratio and the concept of number and explicitly raises various theoretical difficulties. In particular, he contributes to the theoretical study of the concept of [[irrational number]].&lt;ref name="Iranica Online" /&gt; Displeased with Euclid's definition of equal ratios, he redefined the concept of a number by the use of a continuous fraction as the means of expressing a ratio. Rosenfeld and Youschkevitch (1973) argue that "by placing irrational quantities and numbers on the same operational scale, [Khayyam] began a true revolution in the doctrine of number." Likewise, it was noted by [[Dirk Jan Struik|D. J. Struik]] that Omar was "on the road to that extension of the number concept which leads to the notion of the [[real number]]."&lt;ref name="Struik" /&gt;{{rp|284}}

===Geometric algebra===

Rashed and Vahabzadeh (2000) have argued that because of his thoroughgoing geometrical approach to algebraic equations, Khayyam can be considered the precursor of [[Descartes]] in the invention of [[analytic geometry]].&lt;ref name ="Cooper"&gt;Cooper, G. (2003). Journal of the American Oriental Society,123(1), 248-249.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|248}} In ''The Treatise on the Division of a Quadrant of a Circle'' Khayyam applied algebra to geometry. In this work, he devoted himself mainly to investigating whether it is possible to divide a circular quadrant into two parts such that the line segments projected from the dividing point to the perpendicular diameters of the circle form a specific ratio. His solution, in turn, employed several curve constructions that led to equations containing cubic and quadratic terms.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;{{rp|248}}

{{Quote box|quote=From the [[Indian mathematics|Indians]] one has methods for obtaining [[square root|square]] and [[cube root]]s, methods based on knowledge of individual cases—namely the knowledge of the squares of the nine digits 1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (etc.) and their respective products, i.e. 2 × 3 etc. We have written a treatise on the proof of the validity of those methods and that they satisfy the conditions.

In his algebraic treatise, Khayyam alludes to a book he had written on the extraction of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th root of the numbers using a law which he had discovered which did not depend on geometric figures.&lt;ref name="Evelyn Kennedy" /&gt; This book was most likely titled ''The difficulties of arithmetic'' ({{lang|ar-Latn|Moškelāt al-hesāb}}),&lt;ref name="Iranica Online" /&gt; and is not extant. Based on the context, some historians of mathematics such as D. J. Struik, believe that Omar must have known the formula for the expansion of the binomial &lt;math&gt;(a+b)^n&lt;/math&gt;, where {{math|''n''}} is a positive integer.&lt;ref name="Struik" /&gt;{{rp|282}} The case of power 2 is explicitly stated in Euclid's elements and the case of at most power 3 had been established by Indian mathematicians. Khayyam was the mathematician who noticed the importance of a general binomial theorem. The argument supporting the claim that Khayyam had a general binomial theorem is based on his ability to extract roots.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Coolidge, ''The Story of the Binomial Theorem'', [[American Mathematical Monthly|Amer. Math. Monthly]], Vol. 56, No. 3 (Mar., 1949), pp. 147–157&lt;/ref&gt; The arrangement of numbers known as [[Pascal's triangle]] enables one to write down the coefficients in a binomial expansion. This [[triangular array]] sometimes is known as Omar Khayyam's triangle.&lt;ref name="Evelyn Kennedy" /&gt;

==Astronomy==
{{main|Jalali calendar}}
[[File:Jalaali_Leap_Year.svg|thumb|Representation of the intercalation scheme of the Jalali calendar]]
In 1074, Omar Khayyam was commissioned by Sultan Malik-Shah to build an [[Isfahan Observatory|observatory at Isfahan]] and reform the [[Iranian calendar|Persian calendar]]. There was a panel of eight scholars working under the direction of Khayyam to make large-scale astronomical observations and revise the astronomical tables.&lt;ref name="Evelyn Kennedy" /&gt;{{rp|141}} Recalibrating the calendar fixed the first day of the year at the exact moment of the passing of the Sun's center across [[vernal equinox]]. This marks the beginning of spring or [[Nowrūz]], a day in which the Sun enters the first degree of [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] before noon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|first=Musa|last= Akrami|title= The development of Iranian calendar: historical and astronomical foundations|eprint=1111.4926|class= physics.hist-ph|year= 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Panaino|first1=A|last2=Abdollahy|first2=R|last3=Balland|first3=D|title=CALENDARS (In the Islamic period)|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/calendars#pt2|website=Encyclopædia Iranica|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulted calendar was named in Malik-Shah's honor as the [[Jalali calendar|Jalālī calendar]], and was inaugurated on Friday, March 15, 1079.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The ninth-century renaissance in astronomy|first=Charlotte|last=Farrell|journal=The Physics Teacher|volume=34|issue=5|pages=268–272|date=1996|doi=10.1119/1.2344432|bibcode = 1996PhTea..34..268F }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[observatory]] itself was disused after the death of Malik-Shah in 1092.&lt;ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" /&gt;{{rp|659}}

The Jalālī calendar was a true [[solar calendar]] where the duration of each month is equal to the time of the passage of the Sun across the corresponding sign of the [[Zodiac]]. The calendar reform introduced a unique 33-year [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] cycle. As indicated by the works of [[al-Khazini|Khazini]], Khayyam's group implemented an intercalation system based on quadrennial and quinquennial [[leap years]]. Therefore, the calendar consisted of 25 ordinary years that included 365 days, and 8 leap years that included 366 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|first=M|last= Heydari-Malayeri|title= concise review of the Iranian calendar|eprint=astro-ph/0409620|year= 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calendar remained in use across [[Greater Iran]] from the 11th to the 20th centuries. In 1911 the Jalali calendar became the official national calendar of [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Iran]]. In 1925 this calendar was simplified and the names of the months were modernized, resulting in the [[Iranian calendars#Modern calendar: Solar Hijri .28SH.29|modern Iranian calendar]]. The Jalali calendar is more accurate than the [[Gregorian calendar]] of 1582,&lt;ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" /&gt;{{rp|659}} with an error of one day accumulating over 5,000 years, compared to one day every 3,330 years in the Gregorian calendar.&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" /&gt;{{rp|200}} 
[[Moritz Cantor]] considered it the most perfect calendar ever devised.&lt;ref name="Great Muslim Mathematicians"/&gt;{{rp|101}}

One of his pupils [[Nizami Aruzi|Nizami Aruzi of Samarcand]] relates that Khayyam apparently did not have a belief in astrology and divination: "I did not observe that he (''scil.'' Omar Khayyam) had any great belief in astrological predictions, nor have I seen or heard of any of the great [scientists] who had such belief."&lt;ref name="Whinfield" /&gt;{{rp|11}} While working for Sultan Sanjar as an astrologer he was asked to predict the weather – a job that he apparently did not do well.&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" /&gt;{{rp|30}} George Saliba (2002) explains that the term {{lang|ar-Latn|‘ilm al-nujūm}}, used in various sources in which references to Omar's life and work could be found, has sometimes been incorrectly translated to mean astrology. He adds: "from at least the middle of the tenth century, according to [[Farabi]]'s enumeration of the sciences, that this science, {{lang|ar|‘ilm al-nujūm}}, was already split into two parts, one dealing with astrology and the other with theoretical mathematical astronomy."&lt;ref&gt;Saliba, G. (2002). Iranian Studies, 35(1/3), 220-225.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|224}}

A popular claim to the effect that Khayyam believed in [[heliocentrism]] is based on [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]'s popular but anachronistic rendering  of Khayyam's poetry, in which the first lines are mistranslated with a heliocentric image of the Sun flinging "the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight".&lt;ref&gt;Donald and Marilynn Olson (1988), '[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1988Obs...108..181O&amp;db_key=AST&amp;page_ind=0&amp;data_type=GIF&amp;type=SCREEN_VIEW&amp;classic=YES Zodiac Light, False Dawn, and Omar Khayyam]', The Observatory, vol. 108, p. 181-182.

{{See also|specific gravity}}
He has a short treatise devoted to [[Archimedes' principle]] (in full title, ''On the Deception of Knowing the Two Quantities of Gold and Silver in a Compound Made of the Two''). For a compound of gold adulterated with silver, he describes a method to measure more exactly the weight per capacity of each element. It involves weighing the compound both in air and in water, since weights are easier to measure exactly than volumes. By repeating the same with both gold and silver one finds exactly how much heavier than water gold, silver and the compound were. This treatise was extensively examined by [[Eilhard Wiedemann]] who believed that Khayyam's solution was more accurate and sophisticated than that of [[al-Khazini|Khazini]] and [[Al-Nayrizi]] who also dealt with the subject elsewhere.&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" /&gt;{{rp|198}}

Another short treatise is concerned with [[music theory]] in which he discusses the connection between music and arithmetic. Khayyam's contribution was in providing a systematic classification of musical scales, and discussing the mathematical relationship among notes, minor, major and [[tetrachords]].&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" /&gt;{{rp|198}}

==Poetry==
[[File:Chayyam guyand kasan behescht ba hur chosch ast2.png|thumb|right|Rendition of a ''ruba'i'' from the Bodleian ms, rendered in [[Shekasteh]] calligraphy.]]
The earliest allusion to Omar Khayyam's poetry is from the historian [[Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani]], a younger contemporary of Khayyam, who explicitly identifies him as both a poet and a scientist ({{lang|ar-Latn|Kharidat al-qasr}}, 1174).&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" /&gt;{{rp|49}}&lt;ref name="Dashti"&gt;Ali Dashti (translated by L. P. Elwell-Sutton), ''In Search of Omar Khayyam'', Routledge Library Editions: Iran (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35}} One of the earliest specimens of Omar Khayyam's Rubiyat is from [[Fakhr al-Din Razi]]. In his work {{lang|ar|Al-tanbih ‘ala ba‘d asrar al-maw‘dat fi’l-Qur’an}} (ca. 1160), he quotes one of his poems (corresponding to quatrain LXII of FitzGerald's first edition). [[Najm al-Din Razi|Daya]] in his writings ({{lang|ar|Mirsad al-‘Ibad}}, ca. 1230) quotes two quatrains, one of which is the same as the one already reported by Razi. An additional quatrain is quoted by the historian [[Ata-Malik Juvayni|Juvayni]] ({{lang|fa|[[Tarikh-i Jahangushay]]}}, ca. 1226-1283).&lt;ref name="Dashti" /&gt;{{rp|36–37}}&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" /&gt;{{rp|92}} In 1340 Jajarmi includes thirteen quatrains of Khayyam in his work containing an anthology of the works of famous Persian poets ({{lang|ar-Latn|Munis al-ahrār}}), two of which have hitherto been known from the older sources.&lt;ref name = "Ross 1927"&gt;Edward Denison Ross, ''Omar Khayyam'', Bulletin of the School Of Oriental Studies London Institution (1927)&lt;/ref&gt; A comparatively late manuscript is the [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]] MS. Ouseley 140, written in [[Shiraz]] in 1460, which contains 158 quatrains on 47 folia. The manuscript belonged to [[William Ouseley]] (1767-1842) and was purchased by the Bodleian Library in 1844.

There are occasional quotes of verses attributed to Omar in texts attributed to authors of the 13th and 14th centuries, but these are also of doubtful authenticity, so that skeptic scholars point out that the entire tradition may be [[pseudepigraphic]].&lt;ref name="Dashti" /&gt;{{rp|11}} 
[[Hans Heinrich Schaeder]] in 1934 commented that the name of Omar Khayyam "is to be struck out from the history of Persian literature" due to the lack of any material that could confidently be attributed to him. 
De Blois (2004) presents a bibliography of the manuscript tradition, concluding pessimistically that the situation has not changed significantly since Schaeder's time.&lt;ref&gt;Francois De Blois
, ''Persian Literature - A Bio-Bibliographical Survey: Poetry of the Pre-Mongol Period'' (2004), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=2e55wuzPc3IC&amp;pg=PA307 p. 307].&lt;/ref&gt;
Five of the quatrains later attributed to Omar are found as early as 30 years after his death, quoted in  ''[[Sindbad-Nameh]]''. While this establishes that these specific verses were in circulation in Omar's time or shortly later, it doesn't imply that the verses must be his. De Blois concludes that at the least the process of attributing poetry to Omar Khayyam appears to have begun already in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Francois De Blois
, ''Persian Literature - A Bio-Bibliographical Survey: Poetry of the Pre-Mongol Period'' (2004), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=2e55wuzPc3IC&amp;pg=PA305 p. 305].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Granville Browne]] (1906) notes the difficulty to disentangle the authentic from the spurious quatrains: "while it is certain that Khayyam wrote many quatrains, it is hardly possible, save in a few exceptional cases, to assert positively that he wrote any of those ascribed to him".&lt;ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" /&gt;{{rp|663}}

In addition to the Persian quatrains, there are twenty-five Arabic poems attributed to Khayyam which are attested by historians such as al-Isfahani, [[Al-Shahrazuri|Shahrazuri]] ({{lang|ar-Latn|Nuzhat al-Arwah}}, ca. 1201-1211), Qifti ({{lang|ar|Tārikh al-hukamā}}, 1255), and [[Hamdallah Mustawfi]] ({{lang|fa|[[Tarikh-i guzida]]}}, 1339).&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" /&gt;{{rp|39}}

[[Richard N. Frye]] (1975) emphasizes that there are a number of other Persian scholars who occasionally wrote quatrains, including Avicenna, Ghazzali, and Tusi. He concludes that it is also possible that poetry with Khayyam was the amusement of his leisure hours: "these brief poems seem often to have been the work of scholars and scientists who composed them, perhaps, in moments of relaxation to edify or amuse the inner circle of their disciples".&lt;ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran"/&gt;{{rp|662}}

The poetry attributed to Omar Khayyam has contributed greatly to his popular fame in the modern period as a direct result of the extreme popularity of the translation of such verses into English by [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]] (1859). FitzGerald's  ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'' contains loose translations of quatrains from The Bodleian manuscript. It enjoyed such success in the [[fin de siècle]] period that a bibliography compiled in 1929 listed more than 300 separate editions,&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose George Potter, ''A Bibliography of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam''
(1929).&lt;/ref&gt;  and many more have been published since.&lt;ref&gt;Francois De Blois

==Philosophy==
Khayyam considered himself intellectually to be a student of [[Avicenna]].&lt;ref name=NasrAnthology&gt;Nasr, S. H., &amp; Aminrazavi, M. (2007). Anthology of philosophy in Persia: from Zoroaster to Omar Khayyam.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Al-Bayhaqi, he was reading the metaphysics in Avicenna's ''[[the Book of Healing]]'' before he died.&lt;ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" /&gt;{{rp|661}} There are six philosophical papers believed to have been written by Khayyam. One of them, ''On existence'' ({{lang|ar|Fi’l-wujūd}}), is written in Persian and deals with the subject of existence and its relationship to universals. Another paper, titled ''The necessity of contradiction in the world, determinism and subsistence'' ({{lang|ar|Darurat al-tadād fi’l-‘ālam wa’l-jabr wa’l-baqā’}}), is written in Arabic and deals with [[free will]] and [[determinism]].&lt;ref name="NasrAnthology" /&gt;{{rp|475}} The titles of his other works are ''On being and necessity'' ({{lang|ar|Risālah fī’l-kawn wa’l-taklīf}}), ''The Treatise on Transcendence in Existence'' ({{lang|ar|Al-Risālah al-ulā fi’l-wujūd}}), ''On the knowledge of the universal principles of existence'' ({{lang|ar|Risālah dar ‘ilm kulliyāt-i wujūd}}), and ''Abridgement concerning natural phenomena'' ({{lang|ar|Mukhtasar fi’l-Tabi‘iyyāt}}).

C. E. Bowen (1973) mentions that Khayyam's Arabic poems also "express a pessimistic viewpoint which is entirely consonant with the outlook of the deeply thoughtful rationalist philosopher that Khayyam is known historically to have been."&lt;ref name = "Bowen"&gt;J.

(2010). Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (p. 12). Champaign, Ill.: Project Gutenberg&lt;/ref&gt;  and denied any pretense at divine allegory: "his Wine is the veritable Juice of the Grape: his Tavern, where it was to be had: his ''Saki'', the Flesh and
Blood that poured it out for him."&lt;ref&gt;Schenker, D. (1981). Fugitive Articulation: An Introduction to "The Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyam". Victorian Poetry, 19(1), 49-64.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|62}} [[Sadegh Hedayat]] is one of the most notable proponents of Khayyam's philosophy as agnostic skepticism, and according to [[Jan Rypka]] (1934), he even considered Khayyam an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;Hedayat's "Blind Owl" as a Western Novel. Princeton Legacy Library: Michael Beard&lt;/ref&gt; Hedayat (1923) states that "while Khayyam believes in the transmutation and transformation of the human body, he does not believe in a separate soul; if we are lucky, our bodily particles would be used in the making of a jug of wine."&lt;ref&gt;Katouzian, H. (1991). Sadeq Hedayat: The life and literature of an Iranian writer (p. 138). London: I.B. Tauris&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a later study (1934–35) he further contends that Khayyam's usage of Sufic terminology such as "wine" is literal and that he turned to the [[Carpe diem|pleasures of the moment]] as an antidote to his existential sorrow: "Khayyam took refuge in wine to ward off bitterness and to blunt the cutting edge of his thoughts."&lt;ref name="Bashiri"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bashiri|first1=Iraj|title=Hedayat's Learning|url=http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Fiction/Learning.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this tradition, Omar Khayyam's poetry has been cited in the context of [[New Atheism]], e.g. in ''[[The Portable Atheist]]'' by  [[Christopher Hitchens]].&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens, C. (2007). The portable atheist: Essential readings for the nonbeliever (p. 7). Philadelphia, PA: Da Capo.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Qifti]] (ca. 1172–1248) appears to confirm this view of Omar's philosophy.&lt;ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" /&gt;{{rp|663}} In his work ''The History of Learned Men''
he reports that Omar's poems were only outwardly in the Sufi style, but were written with an anti-religious agenda.&lt;ref name="E.D. Ross" /&gt;{{rp|365}} He also mentions that he was at one point indicted for impiety, but went on a pilgrimage to prove he was pious.&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" /&gt;{{rp|29}} The report has it that upon returning to his native city he concealed his deepest convictions and practised a strictly religious life, going morning and evening to the place of worship.&lt;ref name="E.D. Ross" /&gt;{{rp|355}}

In the context of a piece entitled ''On the Knowledge Of the Principals of Existence'', Khayyam endorses the Sufi path.&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" /&gt;{{rp|8}} Csillik (1960) suggests the possibility that Omar Khayyam could see in Sufism an ally against orthodox religiosity.&lt;ref name = "Csillik"&gt;CSILLIK, B. (1960). THE REAL 'OMAR KHAYYĀM. Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae, 10(1), 59-77. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/23682646&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|75}} Other commentators do not accept that Omar's poetry has an anti-religious agenda and interpret his references to wine and drunkenness in the conventional metaphorical sense common in Sufism. The French translator J. B. Nicolas held that Omar's constant exhortations to drink wine should not be taken literally, but should be seen in Sufi terms as representing an enlightened state.&lt;ref&gt;Albano, G. (2008). The Benefits of Reading the "Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám" as Pastoral. Victorian Poetry, 46(1), 55-67.&lt;/ref&gt; The view of Omar Khayyam as a Sufi was defended by Bjerregaard (1915),&lt;ref&gt;C. H. A. Bjerregaard, ''Sufism: Omar Khayyam and E. Fitzgerald'', The Sufi Publishing Society (1915), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Idries Shah]] (1999),&lt;ref&gt;Idries Shah, ''The Sufis'', Octagon Press (1999), pp. 165-166&lt;/ref&gt; and Dougan (1991) who attributes the reputation of hedonism to the failings of FitzGerald's translation, arguing that Omar's poetry is to be understood as "deeply esoteric".&lt;ref&gt;"Every line of the Rubaiyat has more meaning than almost anything you could read in Sufi literature" Abdullah Dougan [http://www.gnosticpress.co.nz/ Who is the Potter?] Gnostic Press 1991 {{ISBN|0-473-01064-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Iranian experts such as [[Mohammad Ali Foroughi]] and [[Mojtaba Minovi]] unanimously rejected the hypothesis that Omar Khayyam was a Sufi.&lt;ref name="Bowen" /&gt;{{rp|72}} Foroughi stated that Khayyam's ideas may have been consistent with that of Sufis at times but there is no evidence that he was formally a Sufi. Aminrazavi (2007) states that "Sufi interpretation of Khayyam is possible only by reading into his ''Rubāʿīyyāt'' extensively and by stretching the content to fit the classical Sufi doctrine."&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" /&gt;{{rp|128}} Furthermore, Frye (1975) emphasizes that Khayyam was intensely disliked by a number of celebrated Sufi mystics who belonged to the same century. This includes [[Shams Tabrizi]] (spiritual guide of [[Rumi]]),&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" /&gt;{{rp|58}} [[Najm al-Din Razi|Najm al-Din Daya]] who described Omar Khayyam as "an unhappy philosopher, atheist, and materialist",&lt;ref name="Bowen" /&gt;{{rp|71}} and [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]] who regarded him not as a fellow-mystic but a free-thinking scientist who awaited punishments hereafter.&lt;ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" /&gt;{{rp|663}}

[[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] argues that it is "reductive" to use a literal interpretation of his verses (many of which are of uncertain authenticity to begin with) to establish Omar Khayyam's philosophy. Instead, he adduces Khayyam's interpretive translation of [[Avicenna]]'s treatise ''Discourse on Unity'' ({{lang|ar-Latn|Al-Khutbat al-Tawhīd}}), where he
expresses orthodox views on [[tawhid|Divine Unity]] in agreement with the author.&lt;ref name=nasrkhayyamphil&gt;[[#refNasr|S. H. Nasr]], 2006, Islamic Philosophy from Its Origin to the Present, Chapter 9., pp. 165–183&lt;/ref&gt; The prose works believed to be Omar's are written in the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] style and are explicitly theistic, dealing with subjects such as [[the existence of God]] and [[theodicy]].&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" /&gt;{{rp|160}} As noted by Bowen these works indicate his involvement in the problems of metaphysics rather than in the subtleties of Sufism.&lt;ref name="Bowen" /&gt;{{rp|71}} As evidence of Khayyam's faith and/or conformity to Islamic customs, Aminrazavi mentions that in his treatises he offers salutations and prayers, praising God and [[Muhammad]]. In most biographical extracts, he is referred to with religious honorifics such as {{lang|ar-Latn|[[Imām]]}}, ''The Patron of Faith'' ({{lang|ar|Ghīyāth al-Dīn}}), and ''The Evidence of Truth'' ({{lang|ar|Hujjat al-Haqq}}).&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" /&gt; He also notes that biographers who praise his religiosity generally avoid making reference to his poetry, while the ones who mention them often do not praise his religious character.&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" /&gt;{{rp|48}} For instance Al-Bayhaqi's account which antedates by some years other biographical notices, speaks of Omar as a very pious man who professed orthodox views down to his last hour.&lt;ref name = "Bayhaqi"&gt;Meyerhof, M. (1948). 'Alī al-Bayhaqī's Tatimmat Siwān al-Hikma: A Biographical Work on Learned Men of the Islam. Osiris, 8, 122-217.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|174}}

On the basis of all the existing textual and biographical evidence, the question remains somewhat open,&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" /&gt;{{rp|11}} and as a result Khayyam has received sharply conflicting appreciations and criticisms.&lt;ref name="E.D. Ross" /&gt;{{rp|350}}

The various biographical extracts referring to Omar Khayyam describe him as unequalled in scientific knowledge and achievement during his time.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. by the author of ''Firdaws al-tawārikh'' (Ross 1898:356), author of ''Tārikh alfī'' (Ross 1898:358), and [[al-Isfahani]]  (Aminrazavi 2007:49).&lt;/ref&gt; Many called him with the epithet ''King of the Wise'' ({{lang-ar|ملک الحکما}}).&lt;ref name="Ross 1927" /&gt;{{rp|436}}&lt;ref name="Evelyn Kennedy" /&gt;{{rp|141}} [[Shahrazuri]] (d. 1300) esteems him highly as a mathematician, and claims that he may be regarded as "the successor of Avicenna in the various branches of philosophic learning."&lt;ref name="E.D. Ross" /&gt;{{rp|352}} [[Al-Qifti]] (d. 1248) even though disagreeing with his views concedes he was "unrivalled in his knowledge of natural philosophy and astronomy."&lt;ref name="E.D. Ross" /&gt;{{rp|355}} Despite being hailed as a poet by a number of biographers, according to [[Richard Nelson Frye]] "it is still possible to argue that Khayyam's status as a poet of the first rank is a comparatively late development."&lt;ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" /&gt;{{rp|663}}

[[Thomas Hyde]] was the first European to call attention to Omar and to translate one of his quatrains into Latin (''Historia religionis veterum Persarum eorumque magorum'', 1700).&lt;ref&gt;Beveridge, H. (1905). XVIII. Omar Khayyam. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 37(3), 521-526.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|525}} Western interest in Persia grew with the [[Orientalism]] movement in the 19th century. [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]] (1774-1856) translated some of Khayyam's poems into German in 1818, and [[Gore Ouseley]] (1770-1844) into English in 1846, but Khayyam remained relatively unknown in the West until after the publication of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]'s ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'' in 1859. FitzGerald's work at first was unsuccessful but was popularised by [[Whitley Stokes]] from 1861 onward, and the work came to be greatly admired by the [[Pre-Raphaelites]]. In 1872 FitzGerald had a third edition printed which increased interest in the work in America. By the 1880s, the book was extremely well known throughout the English-speaking world, to the extent of the formation of numerous "Omar Khayyam Clubs" and a "fin de siècle cult of the Rubaiyat"&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Yohannan, ''Persian Poetry in England and America'', 1977., p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Khayyam's poems have been translated into many languages, many of the more recent ones are more literal than that of FitzGerald.&lt;ref name="Reception"&gt;''The Great Umar Khayyam: A Global Reception of the Rubaiyat'' (AUP – Leiden University Press) by A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

FitzGerald's translation was a factor in rekindling interest in Khayyam as a poet even in his native Iran.&lt;ref name ="Simidchieva"&gt;Simidchieva, M. (2011). FitzGerald's Rubáiyát and Agnosticism. In A. Poole, C. Van Ruymbeke, &amp; W. Martin (Eds.), FitzGerald's Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám: Popularity and Neglect (pp. 55-72). Anthem Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sadegh Hedayat]] in his ''Songs of Khayyam'' (''Taranehha-ye Khayyam'', 1934) reintroduced Omar's poetic legacy to modern Iran. Under the [[Pahlavi dynasty]], a new [[Mausoleum of Omar Khayyam|monument]] of white marble, designed by the architect [[Houshang Seyhoun]], was erected over his tomb. A statue by [[Abolhassan Sadighi]] was erected in [[Laleh Park]], [[Tehran]] in the 1960s, and a bust by the same sculptor was placed near Khayyam's mausoleum in Nishapur. In 2009, the state of Iran donated a [[Scholars Pavilion|pavilion]] to the [[United Nations Office in Vienna]], inaugurated at [[Vienna International Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2009/unisvic167.html|title=Monument to Be Inaugurated at the Vienna International Centre, 'Scholars Pavilion' donated to International Organizations in Vienna by Iran|first=|last=UNIS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, three statues of Khayyam were unveiled: one at the  [[University of Oklahoma]], one in Nishapur and one in Florence, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://new.tehrantimes.com/news/300191/Khayyam-statue-finally-set-up-at-University-of-Oklahoma|title=Khayyam statue finally set up at University of Oklahoma|website=Tehran Times|language=en|access-date=2016-04-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405082018/http://new.tehrantimes.com/news/300191/Khayyam-statue-finally-set-up-at-University-of-Oklahoma|archivedate=2016-04-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 150 [[composer]]s have used the ''Rubaiyat'' as their source of inspiration. The earliest such composer was [[Liza Lehmann]].&lt;ref name="Iranica Online" /&gt;

FitzGerald rendered Omar's name as "Tentmaker", and the anglicized name of "Omar the Tentmaker" resonated in English-speaking popular culture for a while. Thus, [[Nathan Haskell Dole]] published a novel called ''Omar, the Tentmaker: A Romance of Old Persia'' in 1898. ''Omar the Tentmaker of Naishapur'' is a historical novel by John Smith Clarke, published in 1910.  "Omar the Tentmaker" is also the title of a 1914 play  by [[Richard Walton Tully]] in an oriental setting, adapted as a [[Omar the Tentmaker (film)|silent film]] in 1922. US General [[Omar Bradley]] was given the nickname "Omar the Tent-Maker" in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey D. Lavoie, ''
The Private Life of General Omar N. Bradley'' (2015), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The name has also been recorded as a slang expression for "[[penis]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kimmel, Christine Milrod, Amanda Kennedy,  ''Cultural Encyclopedia of the Penis'' (2014), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[lunar crater]] [[Omar Khayyam (crater)|Omar Khayyam]] was named in his honour in 1970, as was the [[minor planet]] [[3095 Omarkhayyam]] discovered by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Lyudmila Zhuravlyova]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=ru&amp;q=3094+Chukokkala |title=Dictionary of Minor Planet Names – p.255 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1979-02-26 |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2294">'''Otto Buek''' (November 19, 1873 &amp;ndash; 1966) was a German [[philosopher]] and [[translator]] born in [[St. Petersburg]].

He studied philosophy, [[chemistry]] and [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]], and obtained his doctorate from the [[University of Marburg]]. Later he worked as a [[journalist]] in [[Berlin]], where he translated works of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], [[Unamuno]] and [[Alexander Herzen]]. Additionally, with Kurt Wildhagen (1871–1949), he edited works by [[Turgenev]], [[Gogol]] and two volumes of [[Ernst Cassirer]]'s edition of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s collected writings. During the 1920s, he worked as a correspondent for the Argentine newspaper ''[[La Nación]]''.

From a philosophical standpoint, Buek was an advocate of [[Neo-Kantianism]], and as a young man was a disciple of [[Marburg]] philosopher [[Hermann Cohen]] (1848–1918). He was friends to [[physiologist]] and pacifist [[Georg Friedrich Nicolai]] (1874–1964), and only one of three intellectuals in Germany who signed Nicolai's 1914 anti-war counter-manifesto, ''Aufruf an die Europäer''. The other two being [[physicist]] [[Albert Einstein]] and [[astronomer]] [[Wilhelm Julius Foerster]].

'''Otto Weininger''' ({{IPA-de|ˈvaɪnɪŋɐ|lang}}; 3 April 1880 – 4 October 1903) was an [[Austria]]n [[philosopher]] who lived in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. In 1903, he published the book ''Geschlecht und Charakter'' (''[[Sex and Character]]''), which gained popularity after his suicide at the age of 23. Parts of his work were adapted for use by the Nazi regime (while at the same time denouncing him).{{sfn|Harrowitz|1995|pp=223-4}}  Weininger was a large influence on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]],  [[August Strindberg]], and relatively on [[James Joyce]].

== Life ==
Otto Weininger was born on 3 April 1880 in Vienna, a son of the [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[goldsmith]] Leopold Weininger and his wife Adelheid. After attending primary school and graduating from secondary school in July 1898, Weininger registered at the [[University of Vienna]] in October of the same year. He studied [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] but took courses in [[natural science]]s and [[medicine]] as well. Weininger learned [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] very early, later also [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], and acquired [[Passive speaker (language)|passive knowledge]] of the languages of [[August Strindberg]] and [[Henrik Ibsen]] (i.e., [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]]/[[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]).

In the autumn of 1901 Weininger tried to find a publisher for his work ''Eros and the Psyche'' – which he submitted to his professors {{ill|Friedrich Jodl|de}} and {{ill|Laurenz Müllner|de}} as his thesis in 1902. He met [[Sigmund Freud]], who, however, did not recommend the text to a publisher. His professors accepted the thesis and Weininger received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D. degree]] in July 1902.{{sfn|Sengoopta|2000|p=163}} Shortly thereafter he became proudly and enthusiastically a [[Protestantism|Protestant]].

In 1902 Weininger went to [[Bayreuth]] where he witnessed a performance of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Parsifal]]'', which left him deeply impressed. Via [[Dresden]] and [[Copenhagen]] he made his way to Christiania ([[Oslo]]) where he for the first time saw [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s liberation drama ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' on stage. Upon his return to Vienna Weininger suffered from fits of deep depression. The decision to take his own life gradually took shape in his mind; after a long discussion with his friend Artur Gerber, however, Weininger realized that "it is not yet time".

In June 1903, after months of concentrated work, his book ''[[Sex and Character|Sex and Character – A Fundamental Investigation]]'' – an attempt "to place sex relations in a new and decisive light" – was published by the Vienna publishers Braumüller &amp; Co. The book contained his thesis to which three vital chapters were added: (XII) "The Nature of Woman and her Relation to the Universe", (XIII) "Judaism", (XIV) "Women and Humanity".

While the book was not received negatively, it did not create the expected stir. Weininger was attacked by [[Paul Julius Möbius]], professor in Leipzig and author of the book ''On the Physiological Deficiency of Women'', and was accused of plagiarizing. Deeply disappointed and seemingly depressed, Weininger left for Italy.

Back in Vienna he spent his last five days with his parents. On 3 October he took a room in the house in Schwarzspanierstraße 15 where [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] died. He told the landlady that he was not to be disturbed before morning since he planned to work and then to go to bed late. This night he wrote two letters, one addressed to his father, the other one to his brother Richard, telling them that he was going to shoot himself.

On 4 October Weininger was found mortally wounded, having shot himself in the chest. He died in the Wiener Allgemeines Krankenhaus (Vienna General Hospital), and was buried in the [[Matzleinsdorf Protestant Cemetery]] in Vienna.

== ''Sex and Character'' ==
{{Main|Sex and Character}}
[[File:Grab von Otto Weininger.JPG|thumb|Weininger's grave]]''Sex and Character'' argues that all people are composed of a mixture of male and female substance, and attempts to support this view scientifically. The male aspect is active, productive, conscious and moral/logical, while the female aspect is passive, unproductive, unconscious and [[amorality|amoral]]/alogical.{{sfn|Weininger|2005|p=131}} Weininger argues that emancipation is only possible for the "masculine woman", e.g. some lesbians, and that the female life is consumed with the sexual function: both with the act, as a prostitute, and the product, as a mother.{{sfn|Weininger|2005|p=188}} Woman is a "[[matchmaking|matchmaker]]". By contrast, the duty of the male, or the masculine aspect of personality, is to strive to become a genius, and to forgo sexuality for an abstract love of the [[absolute (philosophy)|absolute]], God, which he finds within himself.{{sfn|Weininger|2005|p=148}}

A significant part of his book is about the nature of genius. Weininger argues that there is no such thing as a person who has a genius for, say, mathematics, or music, but there is only the [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] genius, in whom everything exists and makes sense. He reasons that such genius is probably present in all people to some degree.{{sfn|Weininger|2005|p=98}}

In a separate chapter, Weininger, himself a [[Jew]] who had converted to [[Christianity]] in 1902, analyzes the archetypal Jew as feminine, and thus profoundly irreligious, without true [[individualism|individuality]] (soul), and without a sense of [[good and evil]]. Christianity is described as "the highest expression of the highest faith", while Judaism is called "the extreme of cowardliness". Weininger decries the decay of modern times, and attributes much of it to feminine (or identically, "Jewish") character. By Weininger's reckoning ''everyone'' shows some femininity, and what he calls "Jewishness".{{sfn|Weininger|2005|p=274}}

Weininger's suicide in the house in Vienna, where [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] had died, the man he considered one of the greatest geniuses of all, made him a ''[[cause célèbre]]'', inspired several imitation suicides, and created a lot more interest in his book. The book received glowing reviews by [[August Strindberg]], who wrote that it had "probably solved the hardest of all problems", the "[[The woman question|woman problem]]".&lt;ref&gt;In a letter from August Strindberg to {{ill|Emil Schering|de}}, in ''[[Die Fackel]]'', 1903."&lt;/ref&gt; It furthermore attracted the attention of [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], who claimed that "after Nietzsche there was nothing already in this [modern German] fleeting culture so remarkable."{{Sfn|Berdyaev|1909|p=}}

== Influence on Wittgenstein ==
[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] read the book as a schoolboy and was deeply impressed by it, later listing it as one of his influences and recommending it to friends.{{sfn|Monk|1990}} Wittgenstein is recalled as saying that he thought Weininger was "a great genius".{{sfn|Drury|1984|p=106}}  However, Wittgenstein's deep admiration of Weininger's thought was coupled with a fundamental disagreement with his position. Wittgenstein writes to [[G. E. Moore]]: "It isn't necessary or rather not possible to agree with him but the greatness lies in that with which we disagree. It is his enormous mistake which is great." In the same letter to Moore, Wittgenstein added that if one were to add a [[negation]] sign before the whole of ''Sex and Character'', one would have expressed an important truth; that is, he did not disagree with Weininger point by point but as a whole.

== Weininger and the Nazis ==
Isolated parts of Weininger's writings were used by [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[propaganda]], despite the fact that Weininger actively argued against the ideas of race that came to be identified with the Nazis. In his private conversations, Hitler recalled a remark his mentor Dietrich Eckart made about Weininger: "I only knew one decent Jew and he committed suicide...".{{Sfn|Honig|2010|p=}} 

In the chapter titled "Judaism" in his book ''Sex and Character''&lt;ref&gt;[http://brittlebooks.library.illinois.edu/brittlebooks_open/Books2009-06/weinot0001sexcha/weinot0001sexcha.pdf Weininger Sex and Character]&lt;/ref&gt; Weininger writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Jewish race has been chosen by me as a subject of discussion, because, as will be shown, it presents the gravest and most formidable difficulties for my views.

I must, however, make clear what I mean by Judaism; I mean neither a race nor a people nor a recognised creed. I think of it as a tendency of the mind, as a psychological constitution which is a possibility for all mankind, but which has become actual in the most conspicuous fashion only amongst the Jews. Antisemitism itself will confirm my point of view.

...Thus the fact is explained that the bitterest Antisemites are to be found amongst the Jews themselves.

The true concept of the State is foreign to the Jew, because he, like the woman, is wanting in personality; his failure to grasp the idea of true society is due to his lack of free intelligible ego. Like women, Jews tend to adhere together, but they do not associate as free independent individuals mutually respecting each other's individuality.

As there is no real dignity in women, so what is meant by the word "gentleman" does not exist amongst the Jews. The genuine Jew fails in this innate good breeding by which alone individuals honour their own individuality and respect that of others. There is no Jewish nobility, and this is the more surprising as Jewish pedigrees can be traced back for thousands of years.

The familiar Jewish arrogance has a similar explanation...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later in the same chapter he writes: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The faults of the Jewish race have often been attributed to the repression of that race by Aryans, and many Christians are still disposed to blame themselves in this respect. But the self- reproach is not justified. Outward circumstances do not mould a race in one direction, unless there is in the race the innate tendency to respond to the moulding forces; the total result comes at least as much from a natural disposition as from the modifying circumstances. 

The Jew is not really anti-moral. But, none the less, he does not represent the highest ethical type. He is rather non- moral, neither good nor bad. 

So also in the case of the woman...

...In the Jew and the woman, good and evil are not distinct from one another.

Jews, then, do not live as free, self-governing individuals, choosing between virtue and vice in the Aryan fashion...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Accordingly, Weininger's views are considered an important step in attempts to exclude women and Jews from society based on methodical philosophy, in an era declaring human equality and scientific thought.&lt;ref&gt;[https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/p/pod/dod-idx/women-jews-and-modernity-in-otto-weininger.pdf?c=fia;idno=11879367.2014.011 Women, Jews and Modernity in Otto Weininger]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In her book ''Nazi Ideology Prior to 1933'', Barbara Miller Lane shows how Nazi ideologists such as Dietrich Eckart disregarded Weininger's distancing of himself from accusations against individual Jews, and instead simply stated that Jews, like women, lacked a soul and a belief in immortality, and that "Aryans" must guard themselves from "Jewishness" within, since this internal "Jewishness" is the source of evil.{{sfn|Lane|1978}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2393">'''Pancritical rationalism''' (literally "criticism of all things", from [[wikt:pan-|pan-]], "all", also known as '''PCR'''), also called '''comprehensively critical rationalism''' ('''CCR'''), is a development of [[critical rationalism]] and [[panrationalism]] originated by [[William Warren Bartley]] in his book ''[[The Retreat to Commitment]]''. PCR attempts to work around the problem of ultimate commitment or infinite regress by decoupling criticism and justification. A pancritical rationalist holds all positions open to criticism, including PCR itself. Such a position in principle never resorts to [[appeal to authority]] for justification of stances, since all authorities are held to be intrinsically [[Fallibilism|fallible]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20421">The study and teaching of '''philosophy in Canada''' date from the time of [[New France]]. There has since developed no particular [[Canada|"Canadian"]] school of [[philosophy]]. Rather, Canadian philosophers have reflected particular views of established European and later American schools of philosophical thought, be it [[Thomism]], [[Objective idealism|Objective Idealism]], or [[Scottish Common Sense Realism]]. Since the mid-twentieth century the depth and scope of philosophical activity in Canada has increased dramatically. This article focuses on the evolution of [[epistemology]], [[logic]], the [[philosophy of mind]], [[metaphysics]], [[ethics]] and [[metaethics]], and [[continental philosophy]] in Canada.

== 1700s-1900s ==

=== The Roman Catholic Church and philosophy ===
The [[Roman Catholic Church]], one of the founding institutions of [[New France]], had a profound influence on philosophy in Canada. As early as 1665, philosophy, viewed as the handmaiden of [[Christian theology|theology]], was taught in [[Quebec]] at the [[Jesuit]] College there and included studies in physics, metaphysics and ethics as well as the works of [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] (1224–1274). The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and the arrival of the British after 1759, introduced new ideas into New France, including [[René Descartes|Cartesian doubt]], the [[Atheism in the Age of the Enlightenment|atheism]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and the sovereignty of the polity. A reaction to these ideas ensued, inspired by the French philosopher, [[Felicite de Lamennais]] (1782–1854) and was reflected in the works of the colonial philosopher [[Jérôme Demers|Abbé Jérôme Demers]]. This reaction initially took the form of an objection to, and refutation of these "unsettling" ideas, adopted by other thinkers, such as [[Pierre du Calvet]]. After 1840, in Europe as well as New France the reaction of the Catholic Church to the ideas of the Enlightenment, took the form of stronger response that sought to reaffirm the Catholic view and establish a "Catholic" philosophy that removed secular uncertainty by reinforcing the place of God at the centre of the daily life. This new philosophy took the form of [[Thomism]], which in many ways is considered the "French Canadian" philosophy.

In the 1920s the study of philosophy was taken up by universities in Quebec, including the University de Montréal in 1921 and Laval University in Quebec in 1935. This development was both inspired by and coincident with the publication in 1931 of the Papal pronouncement, Deus Scientarium, which sought to mobilize science as the basis of faith. The new century was also marked by notable contributions to the study of medieval history and philosophy by Father Ephrem Longpres, the Franciscan medievalist and the Dominican philosophers, including [[Hermas Bastien]],&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/bios/bastienhermasbio.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles De Koninck]], [[Louis Lachance|Father Louis Lachance]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jrank.org/literature/pages/8138/Louis-Lachance.html&lt;/ref&gt; Father Arcade Monette, Father Julien Péghaire, Father Louis-Marie Regis, and Father Patrice Robert.

=== English Canada ===

In English-speaking Canada, philosophical study was the exclusive domain of the colleges and universities of English speaking British North America and later Canada. Colleges founded during the colonial regime included Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1818, McGill University in Montreal in 1821, the University of Toronto in 1827, Queens University in Kingston, Ontario in 1841 and the University of Ottawa in 1848. The latter part of the nineteenth century witnessed the founding of the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg in 1877, l´Université de Montréal and the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario in 1878 and McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario in 1887. The University of Alberta in Edmonton and the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia, were both established in 1908. All provided courses in philosophy.

The [[Protestant Reformation]] inspired the first philosophers in English speaking Canada. These scholars all taught at newly created colonial universities, and their studies emphasized the philosophical foundation of religion, in this case Protestantism, the philosophical understanding of the natural world (natural philosophy), and the philosophical basis of political systems. [[James Beaven]]'s ''Elements of Natural Theology'', which was perhaps the first philosophical work written in English Canada, is an early example.

Other notable contributors to these ideas included [[John Watson (philosopher)|John Watson]] at Queen's University in Kingston and [[George John Blewett]] at the University of Toronto. Other philosophers included [[Richard Maurice Bucke]] of London, Ontario, John Macdonald at the University of Alberta, [[Herbert Leslie Stewart]] at Dalhousie University in Halifax, [[Rupert Clendon Lodge]] at the University of Manitoba, and [[George Sidney Brett]] and John Irving at the University of Toronto. Many of these figures were influenced by the British idealist tradition, represented by figures such as [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]] and [[Thomas Hill Green]] dominant in Britain in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Of particular note during middle years of the twentieth century was the work of one of Canada's greatest scholars, [[Harold Innis]], of the University of Toronto. Although usually considered an economist and social scientist, his work also reflects an important number of philosophical concepts related to economics and communications. He had a great influence on his colleague [[Marshall McLuhan]].

===New disciplines  ===
The growth and specialization of certain elements of philosophy in Europe, in time lead to their establishment as new disciplines, separate from philosophy. Natural philosophy became the study of physics, moral philosophy evolved into sociology and anthropology and psychology became a branch of study free of the influence of philosophy. These developments were reflected in Canada during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The first full professorships in [[physics]] as distinct from [[natural philosophy]] were established at Dalhousie, Halifax, in 1879, Toronto, 1887 and McGill, in Montreal in 1890. Although these were mainly teaching positions there was some research activity. At Dalhousie, Professor J.G. MacGregor, the first to hold the position at that university, published about 50 papers during his tenure from 1879 until 1899. Other prominent researchers in the field at this time included H.L. Callendar and [[E. Rutherford]], Macdonald professors of physics at McGill and J.C. McLennan at U of T.

[[Psychology]] in Canada was initially considered a part of the discipline of philosophy and university courses were given by members of philosophy departments. The first course in psychology in Canada was taught at Dalhousie University in 1838 by Thomas McCulloch within the framework of studies in philosophy. By 1866 Dalhousie hosted a chair in psychology and metaphysics. McGill offered courses beginning in 1850 when lectures in the topic were presented by Professor W.T.Leach with a doctorate from Edinburgh. The first psychology text written in Canada was penned by William Lyall of Halifax in 1855. However, by the end of the century psychology was still considered an adjunct to philosophy, not a subject of importance per se, but rather a prerequisite for the advanced study of ethics and metaphysics.

Psychology slowly began to make its mark as a separate discipline in the latter part of the nineteenth century. The oldest Psychology Department in North America was founded at the University of Toronto by Professor Mark Baldwin in 1892 along with a related laboratory in psychology. It was here in 1909, that August Kirschmann, who had studied under [[Wilhelm Wundt|Professor Wundt]] at his famous laboratory in [[Leipzig]], undertook the first fundamental psychological research in Canada and presented seminars on the, "new psychology". Dr. E.A. Brett a noted philosopher at U of T, wrote the three volume ''History of Psychology'' between 1912 and 1921. McGill established a psychological laboratory under the directorship of Professor William Dunlop Tait in 1910, followed by the creation of a psychology department separate from philosophy in 1922. McMaster employed a professor in psychology by 1890. The [[First World War]] had an important positive effect on the discipline which was recognized for its use in the fields of personnel selection, training and the post-war rehabilitation of wounded soldiers.

In the years following World War I, the number of staff at the U of T increased to seven and important research was undertaken by Dr. E.A. Bott relating to the rehabilitation of soldiers with muscular disabilities. By 1927 the psychology department at U of T had achieved full independence from the bonds of the department of philosophy. During this period [[Hans Selye]] undertook fundamental studies of stress which cut across the boundaries of medical research, biology and psychology. He began his work at McGill in 1936 and continued his investigations at the University of Montreal starting in 1945. He described the functioning of the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] as the body's mechanism for coping with stress and published a number of books including ''The Stress of Life'' in 1953.

While still under the influence of the departments of philosophy, noted philosophers such as [[John Watson (philosopher)|John Watson]] at Queens, [[John MacEachran]] at Alberta, William Caldwell at McGill and [[George Sidney Brett|G.S Brett]] at U of T, championed the recognition of psychology as a discipline in its own right, leading to the creation of separate departments of philosophy and psychology in many universities. By the end of the thirties the growth of the discipline was sufficient to warrant the establishment of the Canadian Psychological Association in 1939. The discipline of [[sociology]] evolved from the ideas of philosophers [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] in France in the nineteenth century. However it was not until 1922 that Carl A. Dawson was appointed Canada's first professor of sociology at McGill. Honours programmes in sociology were established at McGill in 1926 and at the University of Toronto in 1932. [[Anthropology]] evolved from a long history of interest in Canada's native peoples on the part of Jesuit missionaries, explorers and university professors including Sir Daniel Wilson at the University of Toronto and Sir [[John William Dawson]] at McGill and the inspiration provided by moral philosophy. Professional anthropology got its start in Canada in 1910 when [[Wilfrid Laurier|Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier]] established the Division of Anthropology as a part of the Geological Survey of Canada.

===Fields ===
;Epistemology
Studies in this field have often focused on the philosophy of psychology. Important work in this area has been done in Canada, particularly at the Centre for Cognitive Science at the University of Western Ontario by, Patricia and Paul Churchland, Zenon Pylyshyn, and Ausonio Marras in the early eighties.

;Logic
Studies in logic have been undertaken by a number of individuals. Bas Van Fraassen, William Rozeboom and Alasdair Urquhart have specialized in the semantics of logic, while Hans Herzberger and William Harper have studied the nature of preference. John Woods has investigated concepts relating to relevance and paradox. Others have made contributions to the field, including Charles Morgan (modal logics), Charles Morgan (probability semantics), and Anil Gupta (the semantics of truth and paradoxes).

;Philosophy of mind
All [[Group of Thirteen (Canadian universities)|Group of Thirteen]] have departments of philosophy with doctorate-level staff members conducting research related to the philosophy of mind. The work of Dr. Paul R. Thagard, at the University of Waterloo, with respect to cognitive functions and coherence, is of note. [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], emeritus professor at McGill University in Montreal, has studied consciousness within the context of Hegelianism. Zenon Pylyshyn a psychologist and computer scientist at the University of Western Ontario from 1964 to 1994, has made significant contributions to cognitive science. Other Canadian-born and educated cognitive scientists have made their mark in the US, including [[David Kirsh]], [[John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John Robert Anderson]], [[Keith Holyoak]], and [[Steven Pinker]].

;Metaphysics and religion
Metaphysics deals with the study of the nature of reality. Since the Enlightenment, reality has been seen through the lenses of both religion and science, and frequently there has been a conflict between the views of the two. Following the horrors of the Second World War, the attacks on the views of religion became particularly vigorous with science on the offensive.

Canadian philosophers in the postwar era have attempted, in a number of ways, to resolve these conflicts and to legitimize religious belief. A variety of approaches have been used. Some have stressed the similarities between religion and science, as have F.W. Waters (1967) and Alastair McKinnon (1970). Others, including Lionel Rubinoff, have emphasized the importance of placing our scientific view of the world in a larger human context. There have been attempts to resolve the conflict, through science, as seen in the writings of [[Charles De Koninck]] (1960), [[T.A. Goudge|Thomas Goudge]] (1961), and A.H. Johnson (1962). Others have attempted to argue the rational nature of religious belief. Some, inspired by St. Thomas Aquinas, include [[Bernard Lonergan]] (1952), Louis-Marie Régis (1959), [[Joseph Owens (Redemptorist)|Joseph Owens]] (1968),  Jean-Louis Allard (1979, 1982), and Lawrence Dewan, OP. More general approaches defending the reasonability of religion have been taken by [[Leslie Armour]] and [[William Sweet]]. Still others have attempted to address issues in the philosophy of religion by questioning underlying issues in metaphysics. Those following this approach within the analytic tradition include Kai Nielsen, Donald Evans (1963), Terence Penelhum (1970), Alistair M. Macleod (1973), and Jay Newman (1986). Phenomenology has also played a role, as seen in the work of [[Emil Fackenheim]] (1961), Benoit Pruche (1977–1980), René l'Ecuyer (1980), Jacques Croteau (1981), Cyril Welch (1982), Gary Madison (1988), Hendrik Hart (1990), Jean Grondin (1995), and [[Thomas De Koninck]] (1995).

;Ethics – social and political philosophy
Ethics is the study of questions concerning the nature of right and wrong and good and bad as they relate to human conduct. In many cases, the aim is to use philosophy to make our world and society a better place. Work in the field has grown in the postwar years. Research has been undertaken by a large number of individuals including [[Francis Sparshott]], Kai Nielsen, David Braybrooke, [[Jonathan Bennett (philosopher)|Jonathan Bennett]], Gerald Cohen, Donald Brown, Daniel Weinstock, [[William Sweet]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. Wayne Sumner has been active in the field of applied philosophy. Real Fillion has brought together philosophy and politics in his original work in [[multiculturalism]].

The minority position of the French language and culture in Canada and North America is reflected in the preoccupation of a large number of French Canadian philosophers with metaethics.  Fernand Dumont, Claude Savary, Jacques Grand'Maison, Michel Morin, Claude Bertrand, Joseph Pestieau, Ferdinand Dumond, Guy Laforest, Louis Balthazar, Vincent Lemieux, Guy Laforest, François Blais, Diane Lamoureux, Michel Seymour, Gerard Bergeron, Maurice Lagueux, Jean Guy Meunier, Serge Cantin, Jean Roy, Guy Lafrance, Roger Lambert, Dominique Leydet, Gilles Labelle, Yvonne Thériault, Guy Lafrance, Josiane Ayoub, Pierre Robert, Bjarne Melkevik, and Philip Knee have made important contributions. They may be considered the secular descendants of their Thomist ancestors Of particular interest is the work of the economist and [[Thomism|Thomist]] philosopher [[Bernard Lonergan]], as reflected in ''Insight: A Study of Human Understanding'' (1957), and ''Method in Theology'' (1972), which described his [[Bernard Lonergan#Philosophy: Generalized Empirical Method (GEM)|Generalized Empirical Method]]. His writings are the subject of a 25 volume collection being edited by the University of Toronto Press.

;Continental philosophy
European philosophers of the 20th century launched a number of philosophical movements that were revolutionary both within philosophy and in the larger culture. These movements—phenomenology, existentialism and deconstruction—were often not well received in North American universities, but they have been a regular and growing part of the philosophical landscape of North America since the 1950s, and Canadian universities have played an important role in the development and dissemination of these philosophical ideas. In the 1970s and 1980s, the University of Toronto in particular was internationally known for its experts in what is often called "[[continental philosophy]]". [[Emil Fackenheim]], Kenneth L. Schmitz, Graeme Nicholson, and others made the University of Toronto an international centre for the study of these approaches to philosophical inquiry. At the same time Graeme Nicholson's teacher [[James Doull]], a Hegelian whom [[Emil Fackenheim]] notably debated in print on matters relating to the interpretation of Hegel, taught philosophy as well as classical literature in the Classics Department at [[Dalhousie University]] in Halifax.  Currently, the University of Toronto, with scholars such as Robert Gibbs and Rebecca Comay [http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=17143], Ryerson University in Toronto, with Kym Maclaren, John Caruana, David Ciavatta, and Paula Schwebel, the University of Guelph, with [[John Russon]], and McGill University, with scholars such as Philip Buckley, George Di Giovanni, Hasana Sharp and Alia Al-Saji, are major North American centers for research and teaching in the continental traditions of philosophy.

=== Associations and related activities ===
These years saw Canadian philosophy develop to the point where a professional organization, [[The Canadian Philosophical Association]] (ACPA), was established in 1958 to encourage and promote philosophy in Canada. This was followed by the founding of regional associations in Ontario, Quebec, the west and Atlantic Canada, and the initiation of the Canadian Philosophical Association Annual Congress. The professional journal, ''[[Dialogue: Canadian Philosophical Review|Dialogue]]'' was established in 1962, and the ''[[Canadian Journal of Philosophy]]'' in 1971. Philosophers of note who have been published there include, [[Joel Feinberg]] (1974), [[Jonathan Bennett (philosopher)]] (1974), [[Terence Parsons]] (1980), [[William C. Wimsatt]] (1994) and [[David Gauthier]] (1994).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14940">'''Postcolonial theology''' is the application of [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial criticism]] to [[Christian theology]]. As is in postcolonial discourse, the term ''postcolonial'' is used without a hyphen, denoting an intellectual reaction against the colonial, instead of being merely sequential to it.{{sfn|Sugirtharajah|2006|p=8}}

== Background ==
Postcolonial theologians argue that, in the past, the dominant Western form of Christianity is actually determined, shaped, and defined by [[European colonialism]], implying and reinforcing notions such as [[Eurocentrism]], colonial exploitation, and the superiority of European values and culture.{{sfnm|1a1=Amaladoss|1y=2014|1p=107|2a1=Rakotonirina|2y=1999|2p=157|3a1=Steele Ireland|3y=2008|3pp=683–684|4a1=Sugirtharajah|4y=2006|4p=16}} Therefore, critical examination is needed, and alternative interpretations to colonially-tainted narratives need to be constructed.{{sfn|Althaus-Reid|Thompson|1999|pp=i–ii}} This is done by "revisiting the question of how indigenous cultures can contribute to theology and biblical studies".{{sfn|Steele Ireland|2008|p=684}}

Although [[decolonization]] took place shortly after the [[Second World War]], postcolonial theories did not emerge until the late 1970s. The field of postcolonial theology, correspondingly, did not arise until the 1990s.{{sfn|Kwan|2014|p=9}}

Notable biblical scholars include [[R.&amp;nbsp;S. Sugirtharajah]] and [[Fernando Segovia]] and theologians include [[Musa W. Dube]], Wong Wai-ching Angela, [[Kwok Pui-lan]], and Mayra Rivera.{{sfnm|1a1=Althaus-Reid|1a2=Thompson|1y=1999|1p=iii|2a1=Kwan|2y=2014|2pp=10–13, 18–22|3a1=Steele Ireland|3y=2008|3p=683}}

== Biblical criticism ==
Given its similarities with literary analysis, it is not surprising that [[biblical studies]] was the first field within Christian studies to apply postcolonial criticism.{{sfn|Kwan|2014|p=9}} Adopting postcolonial critical methods, biblical studies is inspired to take into account issues of "expansion, domination, and imperialism" in examining existing biblical interpretation, and in constructing new narratives.{{sfn|Sugirtharajah|2006|p=17}} Indigenous non-Western approaches to theologizing the [[Bible]], previously neglected under the colonial context "in favor of European methods", are now revisited, in hope to "make the Bible comprehensible to the colonized cultures on their own terms".{{sfn|Steele Ireland|2008|p=684}} Therefore, traditional fields of [[translation]], [[exegesis]], and [[hermeneutics]] in biblical studies have to be reconsidered in light of postcolonial criticism, and non-Western perspectives have to be taken into account, even as focal points.

Among various scholars, R.&amp;nbsp;S. Sugirtharajah, one of the principal advocates of postcolonial biblical studies, outlined in his book ''The Bible and the Third World'' three hermeneutic approaches which emerged after [[colonialism]]: the native or vernacular approach, the liberation approach, and the postcolonial approach.{{sfn|Sugirtharajah|2001|pp=7–9, 175–275}}

There are certain benefits of applying postcolonial criticism to biblical studies. First, it opens up potential areas and possibilities for interdisciplinary work, enriching the discipline by enabling multiple approaches to bring in their insights. Second, it allows for criticism towards the way things are done, including the principles and presuppositions of the field. In addition, it also avoids detachment from the contemporary world, as work done in the discipline would have to respond to postcolonial contexts.{{sfn|Sugirtharajah|2006|pp=17–18}}

== Christian mission historiography ==
Reviewing [[History of Christianity|Christian history]] from a postcolonial critical perspective, [[history]] is realized to be intrinsically more than just impartial facts. As history is essentially a narrative of what happened, it is always an interpretation, which is "bound by time, place, and the social, political, religious, cultural and economic positions of writers", and a representation, being an "interested construction of representation through which power is expressed, reflected, and exercised."{{sfn|Rakotonirina|1999|pages=158–159|ps=. Also discussed in {{harvnb|Styers|2009|page=853.}}}}

Postcolonial historical methods, therefore, begins with tracing the development of the dominant narrative, followed by a critical reassessment of the sources and the historiography of the mainstream narrative, and finally teasing out the colonial taints and construct new, alternative narratives.{{sfn|Rakotonirina|1999|pp=162, 173}} This is especially relevant in the history of churches in which missionary work has been heavily involved, as such historiographies tend to have more difficulty in treating Western engagement and local churches from an egalitarian perspective.

As such, postcolonial criticism contributes to the discipline by putting forth a recognition that current narratives are, or at least are likely to be, shaped by the colonial context. This leads to the awareness that there could be, and should be, alternative representations of those parts of history. Biased historical readings are therefore prevented or at least reduced. {{sfn|Rakotonirina|1999|pp=167–168, 173}}

== Christian theology ==
Given the short history of engaging with postcolonial criticism, postcolonial theology as a field of study is still "in its infancy."{{sfn|Kwan|2014|p=9}} It is argued by R.&amp;nbsp;S. Sugirtharajah that its development is further held back by Western reluctance to analyse the theological implications of colonial imperialism.{{sfnm|1a1=Sugirtharajah|1y=2006|1p=19|2a1=Sugirtharajah|2y=2004|2p=22}}

However, theologians from the colonized non-West such as [[C.&amp;nbsp;S. Song]] and [[Chung Hyun Kyung]] have long been theologizing with reflection or even resistance against the colonizing West. Interpreted from the perspective of postcolonial criticism, these theologies could be retrospectively categorized as postcolonial theology.{{sfn|Kwan|2014|p=10}} Geographically, they could also be conceptualized according to the three main continents, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Regional theologies are also influenced by other intellectual trends, such as [[liberation theology]] or [[feminist theology]].

=== African theology ===
In Africa, theology is often articulated in one of two aspects: [[inculturation]] and liberation.{{sfn|Martey|1993|xi}} The former is often described as ''[[African theology]]'', which is a term first appeared in 1965 at the [[All Africa Conference of Churches]], and could be identified as "an attempt by Africans to give theological articulation to their spiritual, political, and economic struggles."{{sfn|Pato|1994|153}} The latter is a form of liberation theology and also has an interesting relationship with [[black theology]] in [[North America]]. This would later influence South African theology, especially during and after [[Apartheid]].{{sfn|Pato|1994|p=156}}

=== Asian theology ===
Asian theology could be understood to be inherently postcolonial,{{sfn|Kwan|2014|p=11}} as it has moved towards a "discontinuity with Western theology and denounced the usefulness of a theology that allied itself with colonial powers and their dominance."{{sfn|Wong|1997}} This resonates with the strong currents of [[nationalism]]. However, since Asian churches have historically been considered under colonial authorities, theologians have had to wrestle with the tension (or even conflict) between religious and national identity. In addition, its focal points include [[indigenization]], liberation from poverty, as well as practical commitment in engaging with the praxis of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wong Wai Ching |year=2002 |title="The Poor Woman": A Critical Analysis of Asian Theology and Contemporary Chinese Fiction by Women |location=New York |publisher=Peter Lang |p=21}} Cited in {{harvnb|Kwan|2014|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the influence of liberation theology is easily notable. 

Asian local theologies include [[Dalit theology]] in South Asia, [[Minjung theology]] in South Korea, and [[Burakumin]] theology in Japan.{{sfn|Amaladoss|2014|pp=9–10}}

=== Latin American theology ===
The Latin American church has been famous for their liberation theology, which influenced numerous theological trends worldwide. It is arguably the earliest postcolonial resistance to western dominance. In comparison, it seems more politically minded, and less concerned in formulating an inculturated theology. Inspired in the 1950s within the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], it critiques the colonial situation in three ways, addressing how oppression was structurally enforced by the authorities, complicit by the church, and internalized by the oppressed themselves. {{sfn|Keller|Nausner|Rivera|2004|pp=5–6, 8}}

{{Hindu philosophy}}
The [[Sanskrit]] term, '''Punaana''' is used to refer to the Purifier, the Almighty Lord or [[Brahman]] who through grant of knowledge purifies our mind and body for our achieving the highest goal, emancipation.

==Meaning==
'''Punaana''' ([[Sanskrit]]: पुनान) or ''Punāna'' is an adjective derived from the root पू (''pū'') meaning cleansing or purifying as in पूत (''pūta'') meaning cleaned, purified, pure, clear or bright, in पूतदक्ष (''pūtadaksha'') meaning pure-minded, in पूनीत (''pūnīta'') meaning cleaned or purified or पुनीहि (''punīhi'') meaning purify;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=http://sanskrit.inria.fr/MW/161.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; it means – destroying (sin), pouring forth or showing (brightness), being clear or bright or purified, washing off (sin),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=punaana+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purification==

The word ''Punīhi'' (purify) appears at several places in the [[Rig Veda]], for example, in ''[[mantra]]'' IX.67.23 -

: यत्ते पवित्रमर्चिवदग्ने विततमन्तरा |
: ब्रह्म तेन पुनीहि नः ||

when [[Rishi]] Vashishtho Vobhau prays for his own purification - नः पुनीहि through various purifying rays of  ब्रह्म ([[Brahman]]) i.e. [[Paramatman]] or the supreme Reality. In the [[Vedas]], which teach the aspirant how to rise in moral and spiritual stature in preparation of attainment of liberation through a combination of works and knowledge, the supreme Reality is referred to as – परम् (parama) which means beyond, सत्यम् (satyama) which means truth, ऋतम् (ritama) which means right or righteousness, and बृहत् (brihata) which means vast or great. Praying to the [[Ashwins]], a Rishi ([[Rig Veda]] X.24.6) hopefully asks -

: मधुमन्मे परायणं मधुमत्पुनरायनम् |
: ता नो देवा देवतया युवं मधुमतस्कृतम् ||

"Both of you are divine, with your divinity purify us so that our efforts to gain emancipation and emancipation itself are both pleasant, and pleasant also is our return from the beyond."

Therefore, a Rishi also prays ([[Rig Veda]] X.105.9)

: ऊधर्वा यत्ते त्रेतिनी भूद्ययज्ञस्य धूर्षु सद्मन् |
: सजूर्नावं स्वयशसं सचायो ||

"May we attain in the form of a boat that which is the glorious power generated by His actions, that power which fills up and thrills the entire three worlds, the power that lifts upwards the created objects, that power which is at once the very basis of life and the impelling force." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rig Veda Bhasha Bhashya Mandala 9-10 Vol.5 Ed.1976|publisher=Sarvadeshik Arya Pratinidhi Sabha|pages=213, 537, 996|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=X2NGnAEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purifier==

Rishi [[Vashishta]] ([[Rig Veda]] IX.67.21) asks the Great Purifier (पवमान) to destroy for all times (विजहि) all obstacles that are near and far, and all fears that are within us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rig Veda Bhasha Bhashya Mandala 9-10 (Vol.5) Ed.1976|publisher=Sarvadeshik Arya Pratinidhi Sabha|page=218|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=X2NGnAEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rishi Medhatithi ([[Rig Veda]] I.15.11) tells us that the intelligent and learned persons must know the Sun shining on its own and the Moon shining brightly in the light of the Sun, both associated with light, and with [[Agni]] which purifies and partakes the oblations offered to it. [[Prasna Upanishad]] (I.7) explains that Agni which in its material form is identified with the gross self is the [[Taijasa]] when in meditation the mind settles inwards, projects impressions and remaining unconnected with the senses is not conscious of the gross body, it then becomes identified as [[Vaishvanara]], the subtle self identified with the mind, the subtle instrument which shines as well as reflects. The mind is the seat of the Intelect, and it is Agni that purifies the mind; a pure mind protects itself, becomes truly invulnerable, and develops super-consciousness and vision which is [[Samadhi]] in which state one sees the inner brightness also shining without everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|pages=140, 77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dXZJXwAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+illumination+of+knowledge+ravinder+kumar+soni&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sNNRU-OrOoXArAeRwYGgDg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

The bright entity at the centre of the [[yajna]] of creation is the self-effulgent immortal single Reality who is the light of all lights; the sun signifies Agni and Agni signifies the Almighty Creator. Therefore, a Rishi ([[Rig Veda]] X.35.5) prays – स्वस्त्यग्निं समिधानमीमहे – "May we know Agni in the form of the brightly shining Sun for our own benefits". Rishi Kavi ([[Rig Veda]] IX.77.2) declares – स पूर्ण्यः पवते – that the Eternal Being, the Creator, purifies all beings. The Eternal Being purifies by eliminating Rajoguna from our systems, eliminating the same [[Guṇa|Rajoguna]] from which all matter was made. [[Prakṛti]] is a mixture of three gunas but the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], which is naturally and eternally liberated, is devoid of association with the gunas because of which fact bliss is not [[moksha]] and not the [[dharma]] of the Atman. [[Prana]], the vital force and the body of the mind and having the power of manifesting itself and becoming active in its own spheres, is Agni, and also the principle of consciousness as the ultimate reality – प्राणो ह्येवैतानि सर्वाणि भवति ([[Chandogya Upanishad]] V.1.15) the purification of the mind is dependent upon the Pranas. It is only when the mind is purified after an initial control of the Pranas that the Atman reveals itself ([[Mundaka Upanishad]] III.1.9).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|pages=121, 130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dXZJXwAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+illumination+of+knowledge+ravinder+kumar+soni&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sNNRU-OrOoXArAeRwYGgDg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Rishis of the Rig Veda (IX.24.1-2) tell us -

: प्र सोमासो अधन्विषुः पवमानास इन्दवः |
: श्रीणाना अप्सु मृञ्जत ||

: अभि गावो अधन्विषुरापो न प्रवता यति |
: पुनाना इन्द्रमाशत ||

that the pleasing (सोमासः) gunas of the Pramatman purify (पवमानासः) men who with the aid of (श्रीणानाः) the body, mind and speech attain purification (मृञ्जत), and that the senses and the sense-organs (गावः) once purified certainly come to the aid of the karma-yogis in realizing [[Brahman]] (इन्दम् आशत).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rig Veda Bhasha Bhashya Mandala 9-10 (Vol.5) Ed.1976|publisher=Sarvadeshik Arya Pratinidhi Sabha|pages=77–78|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=X2NGnAEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Reichstag fire''' ({{lang-de|Reichstagsbrand}}, {{small|{{Audio|De-Reichstagsbrand.ogg|listen}}}}) was an [[arson]] attack on the [[Reichstag building]] (home of the [[Reichstag_(Weimar_Republic)|German parliament]]) in Berlin on 27 February 1933, one month after [[Adolf Hitler]] was sworn in as [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]]. [[Hitler cabinet|Hitler's government]] stated that [[Marinus van der Lubbe]], a Dutch [[council communism|council communist]], was found near the building and attributed the fire to communist agitators in general—though in 1933, a German court decided that van der Lubbe had acted alone, as he claimed. After the fire, the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] was passed. The [[Nazi Party]] used the fire as evidence that [[communist]]s were plotting against the German government, and the event is considered pivotal in the establishment of [[Nazi Germany]]. The term Reichstag fire has come to refer to [[false flag]] actions perpetrated or facilitated by an authority to promote their own interests through popular approval of retribution or retraction of [[civil rights]]. 

The fire started in the Reichstag building, the assembly location of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|German Parliament]]. A Berlin fire station received an alarm call that the building was on fire shortly after 21:00.&lt;ref name="tobias1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tobias, Fritz|date=1964|title=The Reichstag Fire|publisher=Putnam}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26–28}} By the time the police and firefighters arrived, the main [[Chamber of Deputies]] was engulfed in flames. The police conducted a thorough search inside the building and found van der Lubbe. He was arrested, as were four communist leaders soon after. Hitler urged President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] to pass an [[Reichstag Fire Decree|emergency decree]] to suspend civil liberties and pursue a "ruthless confrontation" with the [[Communist Party of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Holborn, Haljo (1973) ''Republic to Reich: the Making of the Nazi Revolution''&lt;/ref&gt; After passing the decree, the government instituted mass arrests of communists, including all of the Communist Party parliamentary delegates. With their bitter rival communists gone and their seats empty, the Nazi Party went from being a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] party to the majority, thus enabling Hitler to consolidate his power. 

In February 1933, three men were arrested who were to play pivotal roles during the Leipzig Trial, known also as the "Reichstag Fire Trial": [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgarians]] [[Georgi Dimitrov]], [[Vasil Tanev]] and [[Blagoy Popov]]. The Bulgarians were known to the [[Prussia|Prussian]] police as senior [[Communist International|Comintern]] operatives, but the police had no idea how senior they were: Dimitrov was head of all Comintern operations in Western Europe. The responsibility for the Reichstag fire remains an ongoing topic of debate and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Reichstag Fire |url= http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007657 |work= Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher= United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate= 12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= 75 Years Ago, Reichstag Fire Sped Hitler's Power Grab |url= http://www.dw.de/75-years-ago-reichstag-fire-sped-hitlers-power-grab/a-3150026-1 |accessdate= 12 August 2013 |newspaper= Deutsche Welle |date= 27 February 2008 |author= DW Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians disagree as to whether van der Lubbe acted alone, as he said, to protest the condition of the German working class. The Nazis accused the Comintern of the act. Some historians endorse the theory, initially proposed by the Communist Party, that the arson was planned and ordered by the Nazis as a [[false flag]] operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who started the Reichstag Fire?|url=http://blog.oup.com/2013/12/reichstag-fire-conspiracy-theories/|website=OUPblog|date=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal = [[The Sunday Telegraph]] | title = Historians find 'proof' that Nazis burnt Reichstag | last1 = Paterson | first1 = Tony | date = April 15, 2001 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/1310995/Historians-find-proof-that-Nazis-burnt-Reichstag.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shirer"&gt;{{ cite book | title = [[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]] | last1 = Shirer | first1 = William | year = 2011 | page = 192 | publisher = [[Simon and Schuster]] | quote = There is enough evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the Nazis who planned the arson and carried it out for their own political ends. | authorlink = William Shirer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building remained in its fire-damaged state until it was partially repaired from 1961 to 1964, then completely restored from 1995 to 1999.

==Prelude==
Hitler was sworn in as [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] and head of the [[coalition government]] on 30 January 1933. As Chancellor, Hitler asked [[Reichspräsident|German President]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]] to dissolve the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] and call for a new parliamentary [[election]]. The date set for the elections was 5 March 1933. Hitler's aim was first to acquire a National Socialist majority, to secure his position and to remove the communist opposition. If prompted or desired, the President could remove the Chancellor. Hitler hoped to abolish [[democracy]] in a more or less [[legal]] fashion, by passing the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]]. The Enabling Act was a special law that gave the Chancellor the power to pass laws by decree, without the involvement of the ''Reichstag''. These special powers would remain in effect for four years, after which time they were eligible to be renewed. Under the [[Weimar Constitution]], the President could rule by decree in times of emergency using [[Article 48]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Rita |last= Botwinick |title= A History of The Holocaust: From Ideology to Annihilation |location= New Jersey |publisher= Peason |year= 2004 |pages= 90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unprecedented element of the Enabling Act was that the Chancellor possessed the powers. An Enabling Act was only supposed to be passed in times of extreme emergency and had only been used once, in 1923–24 when the government used an Enabling Act to end hyperinflation (see [[hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic]]). To pass an Enabling Act, a party required a vote by a two-thirds majority in the ''Reichstag''. In January 1933, the Nazis had only 32% of the seats.

During the election campaign, the Nazis alleged that Germany was on the verge of a [[Communist revolution]] and that the only way to stop the Communists was to pass the Enabling Act. The message of the campaign was simple: increase the number of Nazi seats so that the Enabling Act could be passed. To decrease the number of [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] members of parliament who could vote against the Enabling Act, Hitler planned to ban the ''[[Communist Party of Germany|Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands]]'' (the Communist Party of Germany or ''KPD''), which at the time held 17% of the seats, after the elections and before the new ''Reichstag'' convened.

==Fire==
Shortly after 21:00 on 27 February 1933, the Berlin Fire Department received a message that the ''Reichstag'' was on fire. Despite the best efforts of the firefighters, most of the building was gutted by the blaze. By 23:30, the fire was put out. The firefighters and police inspected the ruins and found twenty bundles of flammable material (firelighters) unburned lying about. At the time the fire was reported, [[Adolf Hitler]] was having dinner with [[Joseph Goebbels]] at Goebbels' apartment in Berlin. When Goebbels received an urgent phone call informing him of the fire, he regarded it as a "tall tale" at first and hung up. Only after the second call did he report the news to Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Schirer |first= William L. |title= The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich |publisher= Mandarin |location= London |year= 1991 |pages= 191–192 |isbn= 0-7493-0697-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both left Goebbels' apartment and arrived by car at the ''Reichstag'', just as the fire was being put out. They were met at the site by [[Hermann Göring]] who told Hitler, "This is Communist outrage! One of the Communist culprits has been arrested." Hitler called the fire a "sign from God" and claimed it was a ''Fanal'' (signal) meant to mark the beginning of a Communist ''[[Putsch]]'' (revolt). The next day, the ''Preussische Pressedienst'' (Prussian Press Service) reported that "this act of incendiarism is the most monstrous act of terrorism carried out by Bolshevism in Germany". The ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'' newspaper warned its readers that "the government is of the opinion that the situation is such that a danger to the state and nation existed and still exists".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Snyder|1976|pp= 286–287}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political consequences==

The day after the fire, at Hitler's request, President Hindenburg signed the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] into law by using [[Article 48]] of the [[Weimar Constitution]]. The Reichstag Fire Decree suspended most civil liberties in Germany, including [[habeas corpus]], [[freedom of expression]], [[freedom of the press]], the [[freedom of association|right of free association]] and [[freedom of assembly|public assembly]], the [[Secrecy of correspondence|secrecy of the post and telephone]].&lt;ref name="conscience33"&gt;{{harvp|Koonz|2003|p= 33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These rights were not reinstated during Nazi reign. The decree was used by the Nazis to ban publications not considered "friendly" to the Nazi cause. Despite the fact that Marinus van der Lubbe claimed to have acted alone in the Reichstag fire, Hitler, after having obtained his emergency powers, announced that it was the start of a Communist plot to take over Germany. Nazi newspapers blared this "news".&lt;ref name="conscience33" /&gt; This sent the Germans into a panic and isolated the Communists further among the civilians; additionally, thousands of Communists were imprisoned in the days following the fire (including leaders of the [[Communist Party of Germany]]) on the charge that the Party was preparing to stage a ''putsch''. Speaking to Rudolph Diels about Communists during the Reichstag fire, Hitler said "These sub-humans do not understand how the people stand at our side. In their mouse-holes, out of which they now want to come, of course they hear nothing of the cheering of the masses."&lt;ref name="Gellately2001"&gt;{{cite book |first= Robert |last= Gellately |title= Backing Hitler: Consent and Coercion in Nazi Germany |year= 2001 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 978-0-19-160452-2 |page= 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Communist electoral participation also suppressed (the Communists previously polled 17% of the vote), the Nazis were able to increase their share of the vote in the 5 March 1933, ''Reichstag'' elections from 33% to 44%.&lt;ref name="conscience36"&gt;{{harvp|Koonz|2003|p= 36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This gave the Nazis and their allies, the [[German National People's Party]] (who won 8% of the vote), a majority of 52% in the ''Reichstag''.&lt;ref name="conscience36" /&gt;

While the Nazis emerged with a majority, they fell short of their goal, which was to win 50%–55% of the vote that year.&lt;ref name="conscience36" /&gt; The Nazis thought that this would make it difficult to achieve their next goal, which was to pass the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], a measure that required a two-thirds majority.&lt;ref name="conscience36" /&gt; However, there were important factors weighing in the Nazis' favor. These were: the continued suppression of the Communist Party and the Nazis' ability to capitalize on national security concerns. Moreover, some deputies of the Social Democratic Party (the only party that would vote against the Enabling Act) were prevented from taking their seats in the ''Reichstag'', due to arrests and intimidation by the Nazi SA. As a result, the Social Democratic Party would be under-represented in the final vote tally. The Enabling Act, which gave Hitler the right to rule by decree, passed easily on 23 March 1933. It garnered the support of the right-wing German National People's Party, the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], and several fragmented middle-class parties. This measure went into force on 27 March and, in effect, made Hitler dictator of Germany.

The [[Kroll Opera House]], sitting across the ''Königsplatz'' from the burned-out Reichstag building, functioned as the Reichstag's venue for the remaining twelve years of the Third Reich's existence.

==''Reichstag'' fire trial==
{{redirect|Leipzig Trial|the post-World War I trials|Leipzig War Crimes Trials}}

In July 1933, [[Marinus van der Lubbe]], [[Ernst Torgler]], [[Georgi Dimitrov]], [[Blagoi Popov]], and [[Vasil Tanev]] were indicted on charges of setting the ''Reichstag'' on fire. From 21 September to 23 December 1933, the Leipzig Trial took place and was presided over by judges from the German Supreme Court, the ''[[Reichsgericht]]''. This was Germany's highest court. The presiding judge was Judge Dr. Wilhelm Bürger of the Fourth Criminal Court of the Fourth Penal Chamber of the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Snyder|1976|p= 288}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The accused were charged with arson and with attempting to overthrow the government.

[[File:Reichstagfire1.jpg|thumb|The window through which [[Marinus van der Lubbe]] supposedly entered the building]]
The Leipzig Trial was widely publicized and was broadcast on the radio. It was expected that the court would find the Communists guilty on all counts and approve the repression and terror exercised by the Nazis against all opposition forces in the country. At the end of the trial, however, only Van der Lubbe was convicted, while his fellow defendants were found not guilty. In 1934, Van der Lubbe was beheaded in a German prison yard. In 1967, a court in West Berlin overturned the 1933 verdict, and posthumously changed Van der Lubbe's sentence to 8 years in prison. In 1980, another court overturned the verdict, but was overruled. In 1981, a West German court posthumously overturned Van der Lubbe's 1933 conviction and found him not guilty by reason of insanity. This ruling was subsequently overturned. However, in January 2008, he was pardoned under a 1998 law for the crime on the grounds that anyone convicted under Nazi Germany is officially not guilty. The law allows pardons for people convicted of crimes under the Nazis, based on the idea that the laws of Nazi Germany "went against the basic ideas of justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/secondworldwar/story/0,,2239610,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront |title= 75 years on, executed Reichstag arsonist finally wins pardon |work= [[The Guardian]] |date= 12 January 2008 |accessdate= 1 May 2008 |location= London |first= Kate |last= Connolly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial began at 8:45 on the morning of 21 September, with Van der Lubbe testifying. Van der Lubbe's testimony was very hard to follow as he spoke of losing his sight in one eye and wandering around Europe as a drifter and that he had been a member of the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands|Dutch Communist Party]], which he quit in 1931, but still considered himself a communist. Georgi Dimitrov began his testimony on the third day of the trial. He gave up his right to a court-appointed lawyer and defended himself successfully. When warned by Judge Bürger to behave himself in court, Dimitrov stated: "Herr President, if you were a man as innocent as myself and you had passed seven months in prison, five of them in chains night and day, you would understand it if one perhaps becomes a little strained." During the course of his defence, Dimitrov claimed that the organizers of the fire were senior members of the Nazi Party and frequently verbally clashed with Göring at the trial. The highpoint of the trial occurred on 4 November 1933, when Göring took the stand and was cross-examined by Dimitrov.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Snyder|1976|pp= 288–289}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The following exchange took place:

{{Quote|
Dimitrov: Herr Prime Minister Göring stated on February 28 that, when arrested, the "Dutch Communist Van der Lubbe had on his person his passport and a membership card of the Communist Party". From whom was this information taken?

Göring: The police search all common criminals, and report the result to me.

Dimitrov: The three officials who arrested and examined Van der Lubbe all agreed that no membership card of the Communist Party was found on him. I should like to know where the report that such a card had been found came from.

Göring: I was told by an official. Things which were reported to me on the night of the fire...could not be tested or proven. The report was made to me by a responsible official, and was accepted as a fact, and as it could not be tested immediately it was announced as a fact. When I issued the first report to the press on the morning after the fire the interrogation of Van der Lubbe had not been concluded. In any case I do not see that anyone has any right to complain because it seems proved in this trial that Van der Lubbe had no such card on him.

Dimitrov: I would like to ask the Minister of the Interior what steps he took to make sure that Van der Lubbe's route to Hennigsdorf, his stay and his meetings with other people there were investigated by the police to assist them in tracking down Van der Lubbe's accomplices?

Göring: As I am not an official myself, but a responsible Minister it was not important that I should trouble myself with such petty, minor matters. It was my task to expose the Party, and the mentality, which was responsible for the crime.

Dimitrov: Is the Reichsminister aware of the fact that those that possess this alleged criminal mentality today control the destiny of a sixth part of the world&amp;nbsp;– the Soviet Union?

Göring: I don't care what happens in Russia! I know that the Russians pay with bills, and I should prefer to know that their bills are paid! I care about the Communist Party here in Germany and about Communist crooks who come here to set the ''Reichstag'' on fire!

Dimitrov: This criminal mentality rules the Soviet Union, the greatest and best country in the world. Is Herr Prime Minister aware of that?

Göring: I shall tell you what the German people already know. They know that you are behaving in a disgraceful manner! They know that you are a Communist crook who came to Germany to set the ''Reichstag'' on fire! In my eyes you are nothing, but a scoundrel, a crook who belongs on the gallows!".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Snyder|1976|p= 289}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In his verdict, Judge Bürger was careful to underline his belief that there had in fact been a Communist conspiracy to burn down the ''Reichstag'', but declared, with the exception of Van der Lubbe, there was insufficient evidence to connect the accused to the fire or the alleged conspiracy. Only Van der Lubbe was found guilty and sentenced to death. The rest were acquitted and were expelled to the Soviet Union, where they received a heroic welcome. The one exception was Torgler, who was taken into "protective custody" by the police until 1935. After being released, he assumed a pseudonym and moved away from Berlin.

Hitler was furious with the outcome of this trial. He decreed that henceforth treason—among many other offenses—would only be tried by a newly established [[People's Court (German)|People's Court]] (''Volksgerichtshof''). The People's Court later became associated with the number of death sentences it handed down, including those following the [[July 20 Plot|1944 attempt to assassinate Hitler]], which were presided over by then Judge-President [[Roland Freisler]].

===Execution of Van der Lubbe===
At his trial, Van der Lubbe was found guilty and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]]. He was [[Beheading|beheaded by guillotine]] (the customary form of execution in [[Saxony]] at the time; it was by axe in the rest of Germany) on 10 January 1934, three days before his 25th birthday. The Nazis alleged that Van der Lubbe was part of the Communist [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to burn down the ''Reichstag'' and seize power, while the Communists alleged that Van der Lubbe was part of the Nazi conspiracy to blame the crime on them. Van der Lubbe, for his part, maintained that he acted alone to protest the condition of the German working class.

==Dispute about Van der Lubbe's role in the ''Reichstag'' fire==
[[File:Gedenkteken Marinus van der Lubbe.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial at the [[Südfriedhof (Leipzig)|Südfriedhof]] in [[Leipzig]]]]
According to [[Ian Kershaw]], in ''Hitler 1889–1936: Hubris'', written in 1998, the consensus of nearly all historians at the time of writing was that Van der Lubbe did set the ''Reichstag'' on fire, and that it was generally believed that he acted alone and that the ''Reichstag'' fire was merely a stroke of good luck for the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kershaw|1998|pp=456–458, 731–732}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Van der Lubbe was certainly an arsonist and clearly played a role, there has been considerable popular and scientific debate over whether he acted alone; the case is still discussed.

It is alleged that the idea Van der Lubbe was a "half-wit" or "mentally disturbed" was [[propaganda]] spread by the Dutch Communist Party, to distance themselves from an insurrectionist [[anti-fascist]], who was once a member of the party and took action where they failed to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.left-dis.nl/uk/marinus.htm |title= Dutch Council Communism and Van der Lubbe}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Gunther]], who covered the trial, described him as "an obvious victim of manic-depressive psychosis", and said that the Nazis would not have chosen "an agent so inept and witless". Citing a letter allegedly written by [[Karl Ernst]] before his death during the [[Night of Long Knives]], he believed that Nazis who heard Van der Lubbe boast of planning to attack the Reichstag started a second simultaneous fire they blamed on him.&lt;ref name="gunther1940"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n69/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers | author=Gunther, John | authorlink=John Gunther | location=New York | year=1940 | pages=48-49}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Mommsen]] concluded that the Nazi leadership was in a state of panic on the night of the ''Reichstag'' fire and they seemed to regard the fire as confirmation that a Communist revolution was as imminent as they said it was.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mommsen|1972|p= 144}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

British reporter [[Sefton Delmer]] witnessed the events of that night and his account of the fire provides a number of details. Delmer reports Hitler arriving at the ''Reichstag'' and appearing uncertain how it began and concerned that a Communist coup was about to be launched. Delmer viewed Van der Lubbe as being solely responsible but that the Nazis sought to make it appear to be a "Communist gang" who set the fire, whereas the Communists sought to make it appear that Van der Lubbe was working for the Nazis, each side constructing a plot-theory in which the other was the villain.&lt;ref name=delmer&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.seftondelmer.co.uk/reichstag-fire.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061205235016/http://www.seftondelmer.co.uk/reichstag-fire.htm |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 5 December 2006 |title= Sefton Delmer's account of the Reichstag fire |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Add note on Goebbels diary, not his and Hitler's surprise --&gt;

In private, Hitler said of the chairman of the Communist Party, [[Ernst Torgler]]: "I'm convinced he was responsible for the burning of the Reichstag, but I can't prove it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Adolf |last= Hitler |title= Hitler's Table Talk, 1941–1944. His Private Conversations |location= New York |publisher= Enigma Books |year= 2008 |page= 121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, {{Interlanguage link multi|Fritz Tobias|de}}, a West German [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] public servant and part-time historian, published a series of articles in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', later turned into a book, in which he argued that Vаn der Lubbe acted alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-link= David Gordon (philosopher) |last= Gordon |first= David |date= 19 December 2008 |url= http://archive.lewrockwell.com/gordon/gordon51.html |title= Nazi Economics |work= [[LewRockwell.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobias was widely attacked for his articles, which showed that Van der Lubbe was a [[pyromaniac]], with a long history of burning down buildings or attempting to burn down buildings. Tobias established that Van der Lubbe attempted to burn down several buildings in the days prior to 27 February. In March 1973, the Swiss historian [[Walter Hofer (historian)|Walter Hofer]] organized a conference intended to rebut the claims made by Tobias. At the conference, Hofer claimed to have found evidence that some of the detectives who investigated the fire had been Nazis. Mommsen commented on Hofer's claims by stating, "Professor Hofer's rather helpless statement that the accomplices of Van der Lubbe 'could only have been Nazis' is tacit admission that the committee did not actually obtain any positive evidence in regard to the alleged accomplices' identity." Mommsen also had a counter-study supporting Hofer, which was suppressed for political reasons, an act that he admits was a serious breach of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Snyder|1976|pp= 287–288}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, [[Hans Gisevius]] a member of anti-Hitler resistance within the German government and former member of the [[Gestapo]], [[Abwehr]], and foreign ministry, indicated his supposition that the Nazis were the arsonists.&lt;ref name="gisevius"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Gisevius]] HB |title=To the Bitter End |publisher= Houghton Mifflin Company |location= Boston |year= 1947 |others= Translated by [[Richard and Clara Winston|Richard &amp; Clara Winston]] |pages= 62–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gisevius posits that [[Karl Ernst]] by order of possibly Goebbels, collected a commando of SA men headed by Hans Georg "Heini" Gewehr, who set the fire. Among them was a criminal named Rall, who later made a (suppressed) confession before he was murdered by the Gestapo. Almost all participants were murdered in the [[Night of the Long Knives]]; Gewehr survived this purge but was later reported, inaccurately, to have died in the war.&lt;ref name="gisevius" /&gt; Gewehr actually lived until 1976 and was involved in much of the post-war controversy about the origins of the fire.&lt;ref name=hett&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hett|first1=Benjamin Carter|title=Burning the Reichstag: An Investigation into the Third Reich's Enduring Mystery|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0199322329|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New work by Bahar and Kugel, as of 2001, has revived the theory that the Nazis were behind the fire. It uses [[Gestapo]] archives held in Moscow and available to researchers only since 1990. They argue that the fire was almost certainly started by the Nazis, based on the wealth of [[circumstantial evidence]] provided by the archival material. They say that a commando group of at least three and at most ten SA men, led by Hans Georg Gewehr, set the fire using self-lighting incendiaries, and that Van der Lubbe was brought to the scene later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bahar|Kugel|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Der Spiegel'' published a 10-page response to the book, arguing that the thesis that Van der Lubbe acted alone remains the most likely explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/04/15/wnaz15.xml |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060813182248/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2001%2F04%2F15%2Fwnaz15.xml |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 13 August 2006 |first= Tony |last= Paterson |title= Historians find 'proof' that Nazis burnt Reichstag |newspaper= Daily Telegraph |date= 19 July 2001 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{ill|Benjamin Carter Hett|de}}'s 2014 study rejects the possibility of a single perpetrator, van der Lubbe, as he had neither time nor appropriate resources for a successful arson attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hett|2014|pp= 318–320|ps=;}} {{cite web |last= Hett |url= http://blog.oup.com/2014/02/spies-burning-reichstag-hidden-history/ |title= Spies and the burning Reichstag |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |work= OUPBlog |date= 27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Göring's commentary===
[[File:Defendants in the dock at the Nuremberg Trials.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hermann Göring|Göring]] (first row, far left) at the [[Nuremberg trials]]]]

In ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'', [[William L. Shirer]] wrote that at [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]], General [[Franz Halder]] stated in an affidavit, that [[Hermann Göring]] boasted about setting the fire:
&lt;blockquote&gt;On the occasion of a lunch on the Führer's birthday in 1943, the people around the Führer turned the conversation to the Reichstag building and its artistic value. I heard with my own ears how Göring broke into the conversation and shouted: 'The only one who really knows about the Reichstag building is I, for I set fire to it.' And saying this he slapped his thigh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Shirer |first= William |title= The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich |location= New York |publisher= Touchstone |year= 1959 |page= 193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Under cross-examination at the [[Nuremberg trial]] in 1945/6, Göring was read Halder's affidavit and denied he had any involvement in the fire, characterizing Halder's statement as "utter nonsense". Göring stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I had no reason or motive for setting fire to the ''Reichstag''. From the artistic point of view I did not at all regret that the assembly chamber was burned; I hoped to build a better one. But I did regret very much that I was forced to find a new meeting place for the ''Reichstag'' and, not being able to find one, I had to give up my [[Krolloper|Kroll Opera House]] ... for that purpose. The opera seemed to me much more important than the ''Reichstag''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/03-18-46.asp |title= Nuremberg Trial Proceedings |at= Volume 9 |date= March 18, 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|433}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==="Counter-trial" organised by the German Communist Party===
[[File:WillyMünzenberg2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Willi Münzenberg]]]]
During the summer of 1933, a mock counter-trial was organised in London by a group of lawyers, democrats and other anti-Nazis under the aegis of German Communist émigrés. The chairman of the mock trial was [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[barrister]] (and Stalin apologist) [[Denis Nowell Pritt|D N Pritt]] [[King's Counsel|KC]] and the chief organiser was the KPD [[propaganda]] chief [[Willi Münzenberg]]. The other "judges" were Meester [[Piet Vermeylen]] of Belgium, George Branting of Sweden, Maître [[Vincent de Moro-Giafferi]] and Maître Gaston Bergery of France, Betsy Bakker-Nort of the Netherlands, Vald Hvidt of Denmark and [[Arthur Garfield Hays]] of the United States.&lt;ref name="tobias1964"/&gt;{{rp|120}}

The mock trial began on 21 September 1933. It lasted one week and ended with the conclusion that the defendants were innocent and the true initiators of the fire were to be found amid the leading Nazi Party elite. The counter-trial received much media attention and Sir [[Stafford Cripps]] delivered the opening speech. Göring was found guilty at the mock counter-trial. The mock trial served as a workshop, during which all possible scenarios were tested and all speeches of the defendants were prepared. Most of the "judges", such as Hays and Moro-Giafferi, complained that the atmosphere at the "Counter-trial" was more like a [[show trial]], with Münzenberg constantly applying pressure behind the scenes on the "judges", to deliver the "right" verdict without any regard for the truth. One of the "witnesses", a supposed SA man, appeared in court wearing a mask and claimed that it was the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] that really set the fire; in fact, the "SA man" was Albert Norden, the editor of the German Communist newspaper ''Rote Fahne''. Another masked witness whom Hays described as "not very reliable", claimed that Van der Lubbe was a drug-addicted homosexual, who was the lover of [[Ernst Röhm]] and a Nazi dupe. When the lawyer for [[Ernst Torgler]], asked the mock trial organisers to turn over the "evidence" exonerating his client, Münzenberg refused the request because he lacked any "evidence" to exonerate or convict anyone of the crime.&lt;ref name="tobias1964"/&gt;{{rp|122–126}} The counter-trial was an enormously successful publicity stunt for the German Communists. Münzenberg followed this triumph with another by writing under his name, the best-selling ''[[The Brown Book of the Reichstag Fire and Hitler Terror]]'', an exposé of what Münzenberg alleged to be the Nazi conspiracy to burn down the Reichstag and blame the act on the Communists. (As with all of Münzenberg's books, the real author was one of his aides; in this case, a [[Czechoslovak]] Communist named Otto Katz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Costello |first= John |title= Mask of Treachery |location= London |publisher= William Collins &amp; Sons |year= 1988 |p= 296}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The success of ''The Brown Book'' was followed by another best-seller published in 1934, again ghost-written by Katz, ''The Second Brown Book of the Reichstag Fire and the Hitler Terror''.

''The Brown Book'' was divided into three parts. The first part, which traced the rise of the Nazis (or "German Fascists" as Katz called them, in conformity with [[Comintern]] practice, which forbade the use of the term Nazi), portrayed the KPD as the only genuine anti-fascist force in Germany and featured a bitter attack on the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]. Formed from dissidents within the SPD, the KPD led the communist uprisings in the early Weimar period—which the SPD crushed. ''The Brown Book'' labelled the SPD "Social Fascists" and accused the leadership of the SPD of secretly working with the Nazis. The second section deals with the ''Reichstag'' fire, which is described as a Nazi plot to frame the Communists, who are represented as the most dedicated opponents of Nazism. The third section deals with the supposed puppet masters behind the Nazis.

The term "Reichstag fire" is used by some writers to denote a calamitous event staged by a political movement, orchestrated in a manner that casts blame on their opponents, thus causing the opponents to be viewed with suspicion by the general public. This is sometimes known as a [[false flag]] attack when the event itself is caused by proponents of a political movement to falsely accuse their opponents. In modern histories the destruction of the palace of [[Diocletian]] at [[Nicomedia]] has been described as a "fourth-century Reichstag fire" used to justify an extensive persecution of Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/booksid=RDqyIcSLJ0AC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164 |title= Constantine and the bishops: the politics of intolerance |first= H.

[[File:Tofukuji-Sanmon-M9589.jpg|thumb|275px|[[Tōfuku-ji]]'s ''sanmon'' (Japan's [[National Treasures of Japan|National Treasure]])]]
{{Main|Mon (architecture)}}
A {{nihongo|'''''sanmon'''''|三門 or 山門}}, also called {{nihongo|'''''sangedatsumon'''''|三解脱門||lit. "gate of the three liberations"}}, is the most important gate of a Japanese ''Zen'' Buddhist temple, and is part of the Zen ''[[shichidō garan]]'', the group of buildings that forms the heart of a Zen Buddhist temple.&lt;ref name="jaanus"&gt;JAANUS&lt;/ref&gt; It can be however often found in temples of other denominations too. Most ''sanmon'' are 2- or 3-[[Ken (architecture)|bay]] ''[[nijūmon]]'' (a type of two-storied gate), but the name by itself does not imply any specific architecture.

==Position, function and structure==
[[File:Komyoji Winter.jpg|left|thumb|A ''sanmon'' seen through its ''sōmon'', (outer gate)]]Its importance notwithstanding, the ''sanmon'' is not the first gate of the temple, and in fact it usually stands between the ''[[sōmon]]'' (outer gate) and the ''[[butsuden]]'' (lit. "Hall of Buddha", i.e. the [[Main Hall (Japanese Buddhism)|main hall]]). It used to be connected to a portico-like structure called {{nihongo|''[[kairō]]''|廻廊}}, which however gradually disappeared during the [[Muromachi period]], being replaced by the {{nihongo|''sanrō''|山廊}}, a small building present on both sides of the gate and containing a stairway to the gate's second story.&lt;ref name="INJ"/&gt; (Both ''sanrō'' are clearly visible in [[Tōfuku-ji]]'s photo above.)

The ''sanmon's'' size is an indicator of a Zen temple's status.&lt;ref name="jaanus"/&gt; Structurally, the ''sanmon'' of a first rank temple as [[Nanzen-ji]] in [[Kyoto]] is a two-storied, 5x2 bay,&lt;ref&gt;The space between two pillars, {{nihongo|''[[Ken (architecture)|ken]]''|間}} in Japanese&lt;/ref&gt; three entrance gate (see photo below).&lt;ref name="jaanus"/&gt; Its three gates are called {{nihongo|''kūmon''|空門|gate of emptiness}}, {{nihongo|''musōmon''|無相門|gate of formlessness}} and {{nihongo|''muganmon''|無願門|gate of inaction}} and symbolize the three gates to enlightenment, or ''[[satori]]''.&lt;ref name="jaanus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fowler"&gt;Fowler&lt;/ref&gt; Entering, pilgrims can symbolically free themselves from the three passions of {{nihongo|''ton''|貪|greed}}, {{nihongo|''shin''|瞋|hatred}}, and {{nihongo|''chi''|癡|foolishness}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zojoji.or.jp/en/index.html Zōjō-ji] accessed on May 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The fact the gate has entrances but no doors, and cannot therefore be closed, emphasizes its purely symbolic function as a limit between the sacred and the profane.

A temple of the second rank will have a two-storied, 3x2-bay, single entrance gate (see photo below). The second story of a first or second rank temple usually contains statues of [[Shakyamuni]] or of goddess [[Kannon]], and of the 16 [[Arhats|''Rakan'']], and hosts periodical religious ceremonies.&lt;ref name="jaanus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="INJ"&gt;Iwanami Nihonshi Jiten&lt;/ref&gt; The side bays of ''sanmon'' of the first two ranks may also house statues of the [[Niō]], wardens who are in charge of repelling evil.&lt;ref name="jaanus"/&gt; 

A third rank temple will have a single-storied, lx2-bay, single entrance gate.&lt;ref name="jaanus"/&gt;

'''Science studies'''  is an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] research area that seeks to situate scientific [[expertise]] in broad social, historical, and philosophical contexts. It uses various methods to analyze the production, representation and reception of scientific knowledge and its [[epistemology|epistemic]] and [[semiotics|semiotic]] role.

Similarly to [[cultural studies]], science studies are defined by the subject of their research and encompass a large range of different theoretical and methodological perspectives and practices. The interdisciplinary approach may include and borrow methods from the humanities, natural and formal sciences, from [[scientometrics]] to [[ethnomethodology]] or [[cognitive science]]. Science studies have a certain importance for [[evaluation]] and science policy. Overlapping with the field of [[science, technology and society]], practitioners study the relationship between science and technology, and the interaction of expert and lay knowledge in the public realm.

== Scope ==
The field started with a tendency toward [[Omphaloskepsis|navel-gazing]]: it was extremely self-conscious in its genesis and applications.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; From early concerns with scientific [[discourse]], practitioners soon started to deal with the relation of scientific expertise to politics and lay people.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; Practical examples include [[bioethics]], [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE), [[pollution]], [[global warming]],&lt;ref&gt;Martello M (2004) Global change science and the Arctic citizen.Sci Public Policy 31(2):107–115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff S (ed) (2004) States of knowledge: the co-production of science and social order. Routledge, Abingdon&lt;/ref&gt; [[biomedical sciences]], [[physical sciences]], [[natural hazard]] predictions, the (alleged) impact of the Chernobyl disaster in the UK, generation and review of science policy and risk governance and its historical and geographic contexts.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; While staying a discipline with multiple metanarratives, the fundamental concern is about the role of the perceived ̳expert‘ in providing governments and local authorities with information from which they can make decisions.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;
The approach poses various important questions about what makes an expert and how experts and their authority are to be distinguished from the lay population and interacts with the values and policy making process in liberal democratic societies.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;

Practitioners examine the forces within and through which scientists investigate specific phenomena such as
* technological milieus, epistemic instruments and [[Epistemic cultures|cultures]] and [[laboratory life]] (compare [[Karin Knorr-Cetina]], [[Bruno Latour]], Hans-Jörg Rheinberger)
* Science and technology (e.g. [[Wiebe Bijker]], [[Trevor Pinch]], [[Thomas P. Hughes]])
* Science, technology and society (e.g. [[Peter Weingart]], [[Ulrike Felt]], [[Helga Nowotny]] and [[Reiner Grundmann]])
* Language and  [[rhetoric of science]] (e.g. [[Charles Bazerman]], [[Alan G. Gross]], Greg Myers)
* [[Aesthetics#Aesthetics and science|aesthetics of science]] and visual culture in science (u.a. [[:de:Peter Geimer]]), the role of aesthetic criteria in scientific practice (compare [[mathematical beauty]]) and the relation between emotion, [[cognition]] and rationality in the development of science.&lt;ref&gt;International Studies in the Philosophy of Science   Volume 16,  Issue 1, 2002, Recent work on aesthetics of science DOI:10.1080/02698590120118783 James W. McAllister pages 7-11, 21 Jul 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[semiotics|Semiotic]] studies of creative processes, as in the discovery, conceptualization, and realization of new ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Zeichen für Kunst: Zur Organisierbarkeit von Kreativität Detlev Nothnagel, ZfS, Band 29, Heft 4/2007 ZfS, Band 29, Heft 4/2007 {{ISBN|978-3-86057-887-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the interaction and management of different forms of knowledge in cooperative research.&lt;ref&gt;Organisierte Kreativität: Die vielen Gesichter der Innovation, Rene J.Jorna, in Zeichen für Kunst: Zur Organisierbarkeit von Kreativität Detlev Nothnagel, ZfS, Band 29, Heft 4/2007 ZfS, Band 29, Heft 4/2007 {{ISBN|978-3-86057-887-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Large scale research and research institutions, e.g. particle colliders ([[Sharon Traweek]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Traweek | first = Sharon | author-link = Sharon Traweek | title = Beamtimes and lifetimes: the world of high energy physicists | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780674044449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[research ethics]], [[science policy]], and the role of the university.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Biagioli: ''The science studies reader''.

Suhrkamp, 1982, {{ISBN|978-3518076484}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the field ==
[[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanislaw Ossowski]] started to introduce the concept in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Kölbel: [http://www.dart-europe.eu/full.php?id=466024 ''Wissensmanagement in der Wissenschaft''], Berlin: Gesellschaft für Wissenschaftsforschung e.V. c/o Inst. f. Bibliotheks- und Informationswissenschaft der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, 2002, elektronische Bereitstellung 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn's]] ''[[Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962) led to an increased interest in not only the [[history of science]], but also its [[history and philosophy of science|philosophical underpinnings]]. Kuhn's work established that the [[history of science]] was less a linear succession of discoveries, but rather the concept of [[paradigm]]s to the [[philosophy of science]]. Paradigms are broader, socio-intellectual constructs that determine which types of truth claims are permissible. Science studies try to identify crucial [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]] as in science and technology, nature and culture, theories and experiments; science and fine art leading to the separation of various science fields and practices. [[Sociology of scientific knowledge]] developed at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where [[David Bloor]] and his colleagues developed what has been termed the '[[strong programme]]'. The strong programme proposed that both 'true' and 'false' scientific theories should be treated the same way.&lt;ref&gt;David Bloor, "The strengths of the strong programme." Scientific rationality: The sociological turn (Springer Netherlands, 1984) pp. 75-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Both are caused by social factors or conditions, such as cultural context and self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Wiebe E. Bijker, et al. The social construction of technological systems: New directions in the sociology and history of technology (MIT press, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; All human knowledge, as something that exists in the human cognition, must contain some social components in its formation process.&lt;ref&gt;Harry M. Collins, "Introduction: Stages in the empirical programme of relativism." Social studies of science (1981): 3-10. in JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt;

It proved however difficult to address natural science topics with sociologist methods, as proven by the US [[science wars]].&lt;ref name=thn/&gt; The use of a deconstructive approach (as for works on arts or religion) on natural sciences risked to endanger not only the "hard facts" of natural sciences, but as well the objectivity and positivist tradition of sociology itself.&lt;ref name=thn&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Latour | first = Bruno | author-link = Bruno Latour | title = When things strike back: a possible contribution of ‘science studies’ to the social sciences | journal = [[British Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 107–123 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-4446.2000.00107.x | date = March 2000 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2000.00107.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view on scientific knowledge production as a (at least partial) social construct was not easily accepted.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;  Latour and others identified a dichotomy crucial for modernity, the division between nature (things, objects) as being [[Transcendental idealism|transcendent]], allowing to detect them, and society (the subject, the state) as [[Immanence#Continental philosophy|immanent]] as being artificial, constructed. The dichotomy allowed for a mass production of things (technical-natural hybrids) and large scale [[global issue]]s that in the meanwhile threaten endangered the distinction as such. E.g. ''[[We Have Never Been Modern]]'' asks to reconnect the social and natural worlds returning to the premodern use of "thing"&lt;ref&gt;In premodern times (and various languages) the term both meant an object and [[Thing (assembly)|an assembly]]&lt;/ref&gt; - addressing objects as hybrids made and scrutinized by the public interaction of people, things and concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lash | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Lash |year=1999 | title = Objects that judge: Latour's parliament of things, in another modernity, a different rationality | publisher = Blackwell | location = Oxford  | isbn = 9780631164999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science studies scholars such as [[Trevor Pinch]] and [[Steve Woolgar]] started already in the 1980s to involve "technology", and called their field '[[science, technology and society]]'.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span dir="ltr"&gt;An Introduction to Science and Technology Studies&lt;/span&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Sergio+Sismondo%22 &lt;span dir="ltr"&gt; Sergio Sismondo&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;span dir="ltr"&gt; John Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/span&gt;, 17.08.2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This "turn to technology" brought science studies into communication with academics in science, technology, and society programs.

More recently, a novel approach known as [[mapping controversies]] has been gaining momentum among science studies practitioners, and was introduced as a course for students in engineering,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demoscience.org/ MIT] web.mit.edu Retrieved on 2009-02-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch/ Ecoles Polytechniques Fédérales de Lausanne] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712012636/http://mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch/ |date=2012-07-12 }} mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch Retrieved on 2009-02-21&lt;/ref&gt; and architecture schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mappingcontroversies.co.uk University of Manchester] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515123357/http://www.mappingcontroversies.co.uk/ |date=2009-05-15 }} mappingcontroversies.co.uk Retrieved on 2009-02-16&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002 [[Harry Collins]] and Robert Evans asked for a third wave of science studies (a pun on ''[[The Third Wave (Toffler)|The Third Wave]]''), namely studies of ''expertise'' and ''experience'' answering to recent tendencies to dissolve the boundary between experts and the public.&lt;ref&gt;Social Studies of Science April 2002 vol. 32 no. 2 235-296 The Third Wave of Science Studies Studies of Expertise and Experience H.M. Collins and Robert Evans doi: 10.1177/0306312702032002003&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sheepfarming after Chernobyl ===
[[File:Pair of Herdwicks grazing.jpg|thumb|[[Herdwick]]s grazing in Cumbria]]

A showcase of the rather complex problems of scientific information and its interaction with lay persons is [[Brian Wynne]]'s study of Sheepfarming in Cumbria after the [[Chernobyl disaster]].&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;&lt;ref name=mah&gt;Wynne B (1989) Sheepfarming after Chernobyl: a case study in communicating scientific information. Environment 31(2):33–39
&lt;/ref&gt; He elaborated on the responses of sheep farmers in [[Cumbria]], who had been subjected to administrative restrictions because of [[radioactive contamination]], allegedly caused by the nuclear accident at [[Chernobyl]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=mah/&gt;  The sheep farmers suffered economic losses and their resistance against the regulation imposed was being deemed irrational and not adequate.&lt;ref name=mah/&gt;  It turned out that the source of radioactivity was actually the [[Sellafield]] nuclear reprocessing complex; thus, the experts who were responsible for the duration of the restrictions were completely mistaken.&lt;ref name=mah/&gt; The example lead to various attempts to better involve local knowledge and experience of lay people and to assess its often highly geographically and historically defined background.&lt;ref&gt;Risk, Environment and Modernity: Towards a New Ecology [[Scott Lash]] [[Bronislaw Szerszynski]], [[Brian Wynne]] SAGE, 05.04.1996&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Science studies / STS on volcanology ===
[[Image:Soufrière Hills volcanic aftermath (Aerial views, Montserrat, 2007) 02.jpg|thumb|The aftermath of the 2007 [[Soufrière Hills]] eruption in Montserrat]]

Donovan et al. (2012) used and described the STS respectively science studies for ''social studies of [[volcanology]]'' and the generation of knowledge and expert advice on various active volcanoes.&lt;ref name=vulc&gt;Amy Donovan, Clive Oppenheimer, Michael Bravo. Social studies of volcanology: knowledge generation and expert advice on active volcanoes. Bulletin of Volcanology, Springer Verlag (Germany), 2012, 74 (3), pp.677-689. doi:&lt;10.1007/s00445-011-0547-z insu-00691620&lt;/ref&gt; It contains a survey of volcanologists carried out during 2008 and 2009 and interviews with scientists in the [[List of volcanoes in the United Kingdom|UK]], [[Soufrière Hills|Montserrat]], [[Volcanology of Italy|Italy]] and [[Volcanology of Iceland|Iceland]] during fieldwork seasons. Donovan et al. (2012) asked the experts about the felt purpose of volcanology and what they considered the most important eruptions in historical time. The survey tries to identify eruptions that had an influence on volcanology as a science and to assess the role of scientists in policymaking.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; 
A main focus was on the impact of the Montserrat eruption 1997. The eruption, a classical example of the [[black swan theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Donovan et al. (2012) cite Taleb NN (2007) The black swan: the impact of the highly improbable. Allen Lane, London 
&lt;/ref&gt; directly killed (only) 19 persons. However the outbreak had major impacts on the local society and destroyed important infractructure, as the [[W. H. Bramble Airport|island's airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/country_profiles/3666502.stm |title=BBC country profile: Montserrat |accessdate=2008-03-08 | date=22 September 2009 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 7,000 people, or two-thirds of the population, left Montserrat; 4,000 to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4237882.stm |date=12 September 2005 |title=Montserrat evacuation remembered |publisher=BBC |accessdate= 19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Montserrat case put immense pressure on volcanologists, as their expertise suddenly became the primary driver of various public policy approaches.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; The STS approach provided valuable insights in that situation.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; There were various miscommunications among scientists. Matching scientific uncertainty (typical of volcanic unrest) and the request for a single unified voice for political advice was a challenge.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; The Montserrat Volcanologists began to use statistical elicitation models to estimate the probabilities of particular events, a rather subjective method, but allowing to synthesizing consensus and experience-based expertise step by step.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; It involved as well local knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;

[[Volcanology]] as a science currently faces a shift of its epistemological foundations of volcanology. The science started to involve more research into risk assessment and risk management. It requires new, integrated methodologies for knowledge collection that transcend scientific disciplinary boundaries but combine qualitative and quantitative outcomes in a structured whole.&lt;ref&gt;Horlick-Jones T, Sime J (2004) Living on the border: knowledge, risk and transdisciplinarity. Futures 36(4):441&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experts and Democracy ==
Science has become a major force in Western democratic societies, which depend on innovation and technology (compare [[Risk society]]) to address its risks.&lt;ref name="Ulrich Beck"&gt;{{cite book |title=Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity |author=[[Ulrich Beck]] |publisher=Sage Publications |location=New Delhi |date=1992 |isbn=978-0803983465}} (in German: Die Risikogesellschaft 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Beliefs about science can be very different from those of the scientists themselves, for reasons of e.g. moral values, epistemology or political motivations.The designation of expertise as authoritative in the interaction with lay people and decision makers of all kind is nevertheless challenged in contemporary risk societies, as suggested by scholars who follow [[Ulrich Beck]]'s theorisation. The role of expertise in contemporary democracies is an important theme for debate among science studies scholars. Some argue for a more widely distributed, pluralist understanding of expertise ([[Sheila Jasanoff]] and [[Brian Wynne]], for example), while others argue for a more nuanced understanding of the idea of expertise and its social functions (Collins and Evans, for example).&lt;ref name="CollinsEvans"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rethinking Expertise |first1= Harry |last1=Collins |first2=Robert |last2=Evans |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=2007 |isbn=978-0226113623}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collins|first1=Harry |title=Interactional expertise as a third kind of knowledge |journal=Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences |volume=3 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=125–143 |issn=1568-7759 |doi=10.1023/B:PHEN.0000040824.89221.1a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Seize The Time: The Story of The Black Panther Party and Huey P. Newton''''' is a 1970 book by political activist [[Bobby Seale]]. It was recorded in [[San Francisco County Jail]] between November 1969 and March 1970, by [[Arthur Goldberg]], a reporter for the ''[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]]''.  An advocacy book on the cause and principles of the [[Black Panther Party]], ''Seize The Time'' is considered a staple in [[Black Power]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seale|first1=Bobby|title=Seize The Time: The Story of The Black Panther Party and Huey P. Newton|date=1970|publisher=Random House|isbn=0-933121-30-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ofari 1970"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ofari|first1=Earl|title=The Rediscovery of Black Nationalism (Book Review)|journal=The Black Scholar|date=1 October 1970|volume=2|issue=2|pages=47–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoessinger 1970"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stoessinger|first1=John G.|title=Recent Books on International Relations (Book Review)|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=1 October 1970|volume=49|issue=1|pages=161–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seize the Time is a first-person narrative written from the perspective of [[Bobby Seale]] who recounts the story of the Black Panthers through conversational style prose. The book begins with an introduction written in 1991 by Bobby Seale wherein he provides an overview of the [[Black Panther Party]] as well as calls for people to become activists in the fight for equality.

==Overview==

The book itself is arranged in seven chronological chapters beginning with “Growing Up: Before the Party” which includes an introduction to Bobby Seale, his initial relationship with [[Huey Newton]], and the antecedent behind starting the [[Black Panther Party]]. The second chapter, titled “Huey: Getting the Party Going” provides the philosophical and ideological underpinnings of party including reference to [[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung]] which is commonly referred to as The Red Book as well as Fanon’s [[The Wretched of the Earth]] which [[Bobby Seale]] introduced to Huey Newton. The third chapter, titled “The Party Grows, Eldridge Joins” chronicles the expansion of the party and the positive effect of having [[Eldridge Cleaver]] who was a writer for [[Ramparts (magazine)]] join the movement. The fourth chapter titled “Picking Up the Gun” provides an account of Bobby Seale and other Panthers getting arrested while attempting to speak out at the state capitol in Sacramento on May 2,1967 against the government creating what the Black Panthers believed to be racist legislation. The fifth chapter titled “The Shit Comes Down: Free Huey,” documents the arrest of Huey Newton and subsequent conviction for second degree murder as well as events surrounding the Free Huey party (also referred to as Huey’s birthday rally) which was a barbeque picnic rally for the Huey P. Newton Defense Fund along with a campaign fundraiser for Huey (who was running on the ticket for Congress from the Seventh Congressional District) and [[Bobby Seale]] (who was running for the State Assembly for the Seventeenth District) wherein a coalition was formed between the Black Panther Party and [[Stokely Carmichael]] as well as other members of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]]. This chapter also accounts the events that occurred subsequent to the assassination of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] including the shooting of [[Bobby Hutton]] and arrest of [[Eldridge Cleaver]]. Chapter 6, which is titled “Chicago: Kidnapped, Chained, Tired, and Gagged” chronicles the events surrounding [[Bobby Seale]] being kidnapped by federal agents and transported to Chicago where he is on trial in connection with the [[New Haven Black Panther trials]]. The final chapter of the book, titled “Pigs, Problems, Politics, and Panthers,” focuses on Bobby Seale’s beliefs regarding the underlying reasons for the Black Panther Raids including Eldridge Cleaver’s negotiations with North Vietnam and the CIA-FBI Infiltration known as [[COINTELPRO]]. This chapter also outlines the rules for members of  Black Panther Party including their fight to end male chauvinism, and an overview of the Black Panther Party’s revolutionary community programs such as [[Free Breakfast for Children]], Liberation Schools, Legal Aid, Free Medical Care, and a Free Clothing Program. The book ends with a final essay regarding the importance of “seizing the time” in the fight for revolutionary change.

{{History of the Gambia}}

'''Senegambia''', officially the '''Senegambia Confederation''', was a loose [[confederation]] in the late 20th century between the [[West Africa]]n countries of [[Senegal]] and its neighbour [[The Gambia]], which is almost completely surrounded by Senegal. The confederation was founded on 1 February 1982 following an agreement between the two countries signed on 12 December 1981. It was intended to promote cooperation between the two countries, but was dissolved by Senegal on 30 September 1989 after The Gambia refused to move closer toward union.

==History==
As a political unit, Senegambia was created by dueling [[France|French]] and [[England|English]] [[Colonialism|colonial]] forces in the region. Competition between the French and the English began in the 16th century when both started to establish trading centers. Although there was some overlap in their areas of influence, French trade centered on the [[Senegal River]] and in the [[Cap-Vert]] region and English trade on the [[Gambia River]].&lt;ref name="Richmond 176"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Richmond |first=Edmun B. |title=Senegambia and the Confederation: History, Expectations, and Disillusions |journal=Journal of Third World Studies |volume=10 |issue=2 |year=1993 |pages=172–194 [p. 176] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The region became more important for both growing empires because [[West Africa]] allowed a convenient waystation for trade between [[Europe]] and the respective [[Americas|American]] colonies; critical to that trade was its provision of slaves for the [[Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As colonialism became more lucrative, especially after the development of the [[Thirteen Colonies]], [[New France]], and [[sugar plantations in the Caribbean]], England and France took greater measures to define their spheres of influence in West Africa. From 1500 to 1758, the two powers used their naval power to try to remove each other from the region. In 1758, during the [[Seven Years' War]] based in Europe, the British captured major French trading bases along the Senegal River area and formed the first Senegambia as a [[crown colony]].&lt;ref name="Richmond 176"/&gt; The unified region collapsed in 1779. With the British occupied by the [[American Revolutionary War]] in North America, the French recaptured [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint Louis]] and burned the major British settlement in the Gambia region. The unified region ended officially in 1783 in the aftermath of the British defeat and independence by the United States.&lt;ref name="Richmond 176" /&gt;

The [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)]] (signed along with the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] that officially ended the American Revolution) created a balance between France and Britain: [[Saint Louis, Senegal|Saint Louis]], [[Gorée|l'île de Gorée]], and the Senegal River region were restored to France, and the Gambia was left to the British.&lt;ref name="Richmond 176"/&gt; In the 1860s and 1870s, both nations began to consider a land-trading proposal to unify the region, with the French trading another West African holding for the Gambia, but the exchange was never completed.&lt;ref name="Richmond 177"&gt;Richmond p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Although the areas were ruled by separate, competing powers, they did not determine an official border between the French and British Senegambian colonies until 1889. At the time, France agreed to accept the current border between the two countries and remove its border trading posts.&lt;ref name="Richmond 177"/&gt;

This decision resulted in the future Senegal (which gained its independence in 1960) and The Gambia (independent in 1965) sharing a large problem: how to successfully maintain two separate countries in a region with shared yet diverse cultural values, and one nation virtually surrounded by another.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Borders==
For each country, the lock and key border situation has posed unique problems for international relations, especially in trade and control of regions surrounding the Senegal–Gambia border. One of the greatest problems for both countries is the ease with which violence could spread through the region. With shared ethnic communities on both sides of the border, a successful coup in one country could lead to a group of sympathizers in the other, bringing danger to the democratic regimes of both countries.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

This fear was realized during the 1981 coup attempt to oust President [[Dawda Jawara]] of the Gambia.&lt;ref name="Richmond 182"&gt;Richmond p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; Senegal's pro-Western stance increased its security worries since its neighboring countries might use the Gambia, secessionists in the [[Casamance]] region (the region of Senegal south of the Gambian border), or other dissident groups to destabilize the Senegalese government. Specific threats came from [[Kwame Nkrumah]]'s [[Ghana]], [[Moussa Traoré]]'s [[Mali]], [[Ahmed Sekou Touré]]'s [[Guinea]], [[João Bernardo Vieira]]'s [[Guinea-Bissau]], and [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]]'s [[Libya]].&lt;ref name="Hughes and Lewis 230"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hughes |first=Arnold |last2=Lewis |first2=Janet |chapter=Beyond Francophonie?: The Senegambia Confederation in Retrospect |title=State and Society in Francophone Africa since Independence |editor-first=Anthony |editor-last=Kirk-Greene |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Bach |location=Oxford, England |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1995 |isbn=0-312-12112-1 |page=230 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the Senegalese government speculated about some dangers, in the late 1980s it had border skirmishes with Mauritania.&lt;ref name="Hughes and Lewis 239"&gt;Hughes and Lewis p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;  After the coup attempt, the government realized that its military forces were not adequate to stop, or prevent, political upheaval. Security of the region was becoming more and more difficult to maintain.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Since the end of colonization, the Senegalese government had maintained trade barriers that provided preferential treatment for French goods imported into the country, while the Gambia had virtually no trade barriers. The opposing trade policies fueled a large black market around the Senegal–Gambia border, which brought cheaper manufactured goods into Senegal.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[black market]] also attracted an export drain into the Gambia. The Senegalese government began to institute a delayed payment system with its groundnut ([[peanut]]) farms. When farmers sold their harvest to the Senegalese government, they would get a voucher, known as a chit, which they could turn into cash after a three-month waiting period.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond p.186&lt;/ref&gt; Not wanting to wait for the Senegalese marketing system to pay them, more farmers began to smuggle their goods to [[Banjul]], where the Gambian government paid in cash; by 1990, estimates show that 20% of the Gambian groundnut market was from smuggled Senegalese crops.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond pp.185–6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth of the Confederation==
In the short term, the Senegambia Confederation was a pragmatic union based on a mutual security interest. As noted, the Senegalese government feared national instability caused by uprisings in either the Gambia or the Casamance region. This fear nearly became reality on 30 July 1981 when Gambian leftists attempted a [[coup d'état]] against President Sir [[Dawda Jawara]]. At the request of President Jawara, the Senegalese army entered the Gambia and put down the insurrection.&lt;ref name="Richmond 182"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes and Lewis p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; The attempted coup resulted in both countries' leaders promoting the unification ideas which had been developing in the region. [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], first President of Senegal, was one of "{{lang|fr|les trois pères}}" ("the three fathers") of [[Negritude]]—a literary and ideologically socialist movement of pan-Africanism, encouraging Africans throughout the Diaspora to embrace their shared culture.&lt;ref&gt;Lawless, Laura K. "Negritude – La Négritude: Introduction to the Francophone literary movement known as la Négritude," French Language at About.com. About.com. 25 January 2006.  http://french.about.com/library/bl-negritude.htm. paragraphs 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Senghor's belief in Negritude informed the possibility of unification between Senegal and the Gambia, and fostered the belief that unification would happen as an organic process.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes and Lewis p.234&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Senegal and The Gambia commissioned a [[United Nations]] report to study the possible plans and benefits of unification between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes and Lewis p. 229; Richmond p.178&lt;/ref&gt; The eight-year Senegambia Confederation was one of the longest-lived African unions of the period.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==End of the Confederation==
Throughout the integration process, support came primarily from the two governments and their social elites; neither the Senegalese nor the Gambian people at large were particularly interested in integration.&lt;ref name="HL 236"&gt;Hughes and Lewis p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Once the threat of political instability began to dissipate, both sides began to move back to their traditional fears and stereotypes of the other. The Gambian government (and the Gambian people) began to fear losing their own power and identity through Senegalese engulfment.&lt;ref name="HL 236"/&gt; Hughes and Lewis, in their Senegambia analysis, list many problems with unions which often lead to failure, which this union shared.&lt;ref name="HL 239"&gt;Hughes and Lewis p.239&lt;/ref&gt;

The union had both pragmatic and ideological elements. Because it was created in response to security concerns, when that threat was believed finished, the confederation's momentum began to die. Senegal unilaterally pulled out its troops from the Gambia when it was threatened by Mauritania (see [[Senegambia Confederation#Borders|Borders]] above).&lt;ref name="HL 239"/&gt; Gambia felt its interests were not being protected. The main platform on which union had been built was also the element on which it foundered. The end came on 23 August 1989, when President Diouf decided it was best that the confederation be placed aside after fruitless talks about a [[customs union]].&lt;ref name="HL 239"/&gt;

As the confederation had economically benefited Senegal's [[Casamance]] region, its end resulted in worsening living conditions of the local population. This helped militant separatists, most importantly the  [[Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance]], to grow in strength and thus partially contributed to the outbreak of the armed [[Casamance conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5646">The '''social multiplier effect''' is a term used in [[economics]], [[economic geography]], [[sociology]], [[public health]] and other academic disciplines to describe certain social [[Externality|externalities]].  It is based on the principle that high levels of one attribute amongst one's peers can have [[spillover effect]]s on an individual.  "This social multiplier can also be thought of as a ratio ∆P/∆I where ∆I is the average response of an individual action to an [http://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~delittle/Encyclopedia%20entries/exogenous%20variable.pdf exogenous parameter] (that affects only that person) and ∆P is the (per capita) response of the peer group to a change in the same parameter that affects the entire peer group."&lt;ref&gt;Sheinkman, José. ''Social Interactions.'' Princeton. Retrieved on 25 February 2016. https://www.princeton.edu/~joses/wp/socialinteractions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is the ratio of an individual action to an exogenous parameter to the aggregate effect of the same parameter on the individual's peers.

For example, we know that health outcomes strongly correlate with education level.  Given the social multiplier effect, we know that in the aggregate, if a poorly educated individual moves into a highly educated area they will experience some of the positive health effects associated with being more educated.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, Enrico. ''The New Geography of Jobs.'' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt: 2012. p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important however to distinguish between 1) a local-average model or [[Norm (social)|social norms]], whereby certain attributes are adopted based on them being the socially normal behavior, and 2) a local-aggregate model or social multiplier effect whereby "peer effects are captured by the sum of friends' efforts in some activity."&lt;ref&gt;Xiandong Liu et. al. "Social Multiplier versus Social Norms: What Matters Most for Outcomes?" Center For Economic Policy Research: 2013. Retrieved on 25 February 2016. http://www.voxeu.org/article/social-multiplier-versus-social-norms-what-matters-most-outcomes.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the former an individual pays a price for deviating from a norm.  In the latter, as an individual gains more peers who have a certain attribute, they will experience greater utility for adopting this attribute as well.  The following are some examples of research on the social multiplier effect.

== Examples ==
Researchers Scott E. Carrell et. al. have shown that one's friends' fitness affects one's own fitness.  They find that "each out-of-shape individual creates two additional out-of-shape individuals through their social interactions."&lt;ref&gt;Scott E. Carrell et. al. "Is Poor Fitness Contagious?: Evidence From Randomly Assigned Friends." Penn State University: 2010. Retrieved on 25 February 2016. http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.296.5005&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Another researcher Jeffery Fletcher has found that a 10 percent increase in the number of students who smoke at a high school increases the chances another student will smoke by about 3 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19382102 | doi=10.1002/hec.1488 | volume=19 | issue=4 | title=Social interactions and smoking: evidence using multiple student cohorts, instrumental variables, and school fixed effects | year=2010 | journal=Health Econ | pages=466–84 | last1 = Fletcher | first1 = JM}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Xiaodong Liu et. al. have found that there is a multiplier effect for [[juvenile delinquency]] in schools.&lt;ref&gt;Xiandong Liu et. al. "Social Multiplier versus Social Norms: What Matters Most for Outcomes?" Center For Economic Policy Research: 2013. Retrieved on 25 February 2016. http://www.voxeu.org/article/social-multiplier-versus-social-norms-what-matters-most-outcomes.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, in another article Carell et. al. find that peer cheating increases the likelihood that an individual will cheat.&lt;ref&gt;Scott E. Carrell et. al. "Peer Effects in Academic Cheating." Social Science Research Network: 2005. Retrieved on 25 February 2016. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=842224&lt;/ref&gt;

The social multiplier effect is of particular concern to researchers in economic geography. It is well documented that factors like income and education have strong positive correlations with many aspects of health. This is important because the geographic distribution of income and education is becoming increasingly stratified.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, Enrico. ''The New Geography of Jobs.'' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt: 2012. p. 101-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, since 1980, on average, cities that had high levels of college educated workers are becoming increasingly college educated whereas those who had low levels are becoming increasingly less educated. The same trend applies to income.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, Enrico. ''The New Geography of Jobs.'' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt: 2012. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, as the distribution of income and education level becomes more disparate, many low income regions lose out on the social multiplier benefits they once enjoyed.

      <comment>with apologies, none of this is OK.  a paper on a clinical trial is a primary source, not  the kind of secondary source that I described on the talk page. Please slow down. Thanks</comment>

'''Somatic experiencing''' is a form of [[alternative medicine|alternative therapy]] aimed at relieving the symptoms of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and other mental and physical trauma-related health problems by focusing on the client's perceived body sensations (or somatic experiences). It was created by trauma therapist Peter A. Levine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=van der Kolk|first1=Bessel|author-link=Bessel van der Kolk|title=The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma|date=2014|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781101608302|page=217|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sessions are normally done in person, and involve a client tracking his or her own experience.&lt;ref name="Scaer 2005"&gt;Scaer, Robert C.: ''The Trauma Spectrum. Hidden Wounds and Human Resiliency''. W.W. Norton &amp; Company, N.Y. &amp; London, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|255–256}} Practitioners are often mental health practitioners such as social workers, psychologists, marriage and family therapists (MFTs) or psychotherapists, but may also be nurses, physicians, [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodyworkers]], physical therapists, chaplains, clergy, or members of other professions. Certified practitioners complete a three-year training course (216 hours of instruction) and must complete 18 hours of case consultations and 12 hours of personal sessions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seaustralia.com.au/somatic-experiencing-australia_professional_training/ Somatic experiencing Australia training], Retrieved 2 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Somatic Experiencing is used for shock trauma in the short term and for developmental trauma as an adjunct to psychotherapy that may span years.

Somatic Experiencing attempts to promote awareness and release physical tension that remains in the aftermath of trauma.&lt;ref name="Scaer 2005"/&gt;{{rp|43–50}}&lt;ref name="Scaer 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scaer|first1=Robert C.|title=The Body Bears the Burden: Trauma, Dissociation, and Disease|date=2001|publisher=The Haworth Press|isbn=0789033348|pages=275|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Body_Bears_the_Burden.html?id=C30EbO7GDMIC|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38–40}}

==Methods==

Another element of Somatic Experiencing therapy is "pendulation",&lt;ref name="Scaer 2005"/&gt;{{rp|255}} the movement between regulation and dysregulation. The client is helped to move to a state where he or she is dysregulated (i.e. is aroused or frozen, demonstrated by physical symptoms such as pain or numbness) and then iteratively helped to return to a state of regulation. The goal is to allow the client to resolve the physical and mental difficulties caused by the trauma, and thereby to be able to respond appropriately to everyday situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mary-ware.com/how-does-se-work.html Mary ware Somatic Experiencing], Retrieved 2 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

"Resources" are defined as anything that helps the client's [[autonomic nervous system]] return to a regulated state. This might be the memory of someone close to them, a physical item that might ground them in the present moment, or other supportive elements that minimize distress. In the face of arousal, "discharge" is facilitated to allow the client's body to return to a regulated state. Discharge may be in the form of tears, a warm sensation, unconscious movement, the ability to breathe easily again, or other responses which demonstrate the autonomic nervous system returning to its baseline. The intention of this process is to reinforce the client's inherent capacity to self-regulate.
 
Somatic experiencing is used for both shock trauma and developmental trauma. Shock trauma is loosely defined as a single-episode traumatic event such as a car accident, natural disaster such as an earthquake, battlefield incident, physical attack, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gomentor.com/articles/shock-trauma Gomentor shock trauma], Retrieved 2 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Developmental trauma refers to various kinds of psychological damage that occur during child development when a child has insufficient or detrimental attention from the primary caregivers.&lt;ref name="Scaer 2005" /&gt;{{rp|99–125}}{{Request quotation|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://weinholds.org/what-is-developmental-trauma-2/ Weinholds developmental trauma], retrieved 2 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sylvester Judd''' (July 23, 1813 – January 26, 1853) was a Unitarian minister and an American novelist.

==Biography==
Sylvester Judd III was born on July 23, 1813, in [[Westhampton, Massachusetts]]&lt;ref&gt;Dedmond, Francis B. ''Sylvester Judd''. New York: Twayne Publishers, 1980: 17. {{ISBN|0-8057-7305-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Sylvester Judd II and Apphia Hall, a daughter of Aaron Hall of Norwich, a veteran of the Revolutionary War, one-year attendee at Harvard and later modest Justice of the Peace.&lt;ref&gt;Hathaway, Richard D. ''Sylvester Judd's New England''. Pennsylvania State University Press, 1981: 41. {{ISBN|0-271-00307-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His great-grandfather was Rev. Jonathan Judd (1719-1803), clergyman of Southampton, while his grandfather ran the family store.  His father, after working in the store in his boyhood, went to Boston for several years, where, according to Judd's sister's biography, he became a voracious reader, returning to the family business, but then becoming editor of ''The Hampshire Gazette''.  Sylvester Judd III studied at Hopkins Academy in [[Hadley, Massachusetts]], where he was president of the Literary Society and delivered the valedictorian address.  He graduated from [[Yale College]] in 1836, and from [[Harvard Divinity School]] in 1840. His dissertation was entitled ''The Uses of Intellectual Philosophy to the Preacher''.  While a student, on April 4, 1838, Judd traveled to [[Concord, Massachusetts]] to meet [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] after reading his essay "Epic Poetry". Emerson was pleased by Judd's interest in seeking a mystical identification with Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Dedmond, Francis B. ''Sylvester Judd''. New York: Twayne Publishers, 1980: 33. {{ISBN|0-8057-7305-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judd may have been in the audience on August 31, 1837, and heard Emerson's commencement speech to the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] Society known as "The American Scholar."

Judd was ordained a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister on October 1, 1840, becoming pastor of a church in [[Augusta, Maine]]. He was a member of the Maine Peace Society which was anti-war and sought justice through a World Court.  Early in 1841, Judd met Jane Elizabeth Williams, the daughter of United States Senator [[Reuel Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;Dedmond, Francis B. ''Sylvester Judd''. New York: Twayne Publishers, 1980: 39. {{ISBN|0-8057-7305-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple married on August 31, 1841; they had three daughters:  Jane Elizabeth (September 26, 1844), Frances Hall (June 28, 1847), and Apphia Williams (March 16, 1853).  Judd's third daughter was born two months after his death.  His second daughter, Frances, married the Unitarian minister Seth Curtis Beach on November 17, 1869. Their son, Reuel W. Beach (Harvard graduate, married Ruth Walcott Stetson in 1909), and grandson, Curtis Beach, were both Unitarian ministers. Frances and Seth Beach's second son, Dr. Sylvester Judd Beach, lived from 1879-1953, residing in Portland, ME. Dr. Beach served as President of the Wayflete School in Portland, bringing progressive education to the school. Sylvester Judd's sister, Apphia Putnam Judd (born Oct 27, 1820 in Westhampton; died 1901 in Augusta), married his wife's brother, Joseph Hartwell Williams (1814-1896), who was the 27th governor of Maine (1857-1858).

==Influences==
According to Philip Brockway, Judd's early influences were Calvinist puritanism.  After a spiritual conversion to Unitarianism as a young man, his readings took on wide spheres, particularly while at Yale College and then Harvard Divinity School.  His readings included the poetry of [[Jones Very]], the writings of [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Robert Owen]],  Goethe's [[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]], ''Goethe's Conversations with a Child'' by [[Bettina von Arnim]], and the writings of [[William Ellery Channing]], the Unitarian theologian, and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].

Brockway cites Emerson's journal entry from 1852, the year before Judd's death at 40:  "I saw Judd in Augusta [Maine], in February, and asked him who his companions were.  He said, 'Sunsets.' I told him I thought they needed men. He said, 'I'm a priest and converse with the sick and dying.'"

==Criticism==
American critic and poet [[James Russell Lowell]] called Judd's novel ''Margaret'' "the most emphatically American book ever written".&lt;ref&gt;Gura, Philip F. ''American Transcendentalism: A History''. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 198. {{ISBN|0-8090-3477-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned the novel in his long satire ''[[A Fable for Critics]]'' (1848) as "the first Yankee book / With the ''soul'' of Down East in 't, and things farther East".&lt;ref&gt;Hathaway, Richard D. ''Sylvester Judd's New England''. Pennsylvania State University Press, 1981: 13. {{ISBN|0-271-00307-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 39-page review, however, critic [[William Bourne Oliver Peabody]] called the work unfinished and its characters and style inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;Dedmond, Francis B. ''Sylvester Judd''. New York: Twayne Publishers, 1980: 77–78. {{ISBN|0-8057-7305-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After publishing his novel ''Philo'', Judd sent a copy to [[Edward Everett Hale]], who responded, "I think ''Philo'' glorious."&lt;ref&gt;Hathaway, Richard D. ''Sylvester Judd's New England''. Pennsylvania State University Press, 1981: 349. {{ISBN|0-271-00307-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The critic and poet [[Richard J. Powers]] finds the child characterization of Margaret in the novel the prototype for Nathaniel Hawthorne's character of Pearl, Hester Prynne's daughter, in the 1850 novel ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]''.

The '''''Symposium''''' ({{lang-grc|Συμπόσιον}}, ''Sympósion'' {{IPA-grc|sympósi̯on|}}) is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] text by [[Plato]] dated c. 385–370 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leitao, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; It  depicts a friendly contest of extemporaneous speeches given by a group of notable men attending a banquet. The men include the philosopher [[Socrates]], the general and political figure [[Alcibiades]], and the comic playwright [[Aristophanes]]. The speeches are to be given in praise of [[Eros]], who is the god of love and desire, and the son of Aphrodite. In the ''Symposium'', Eros is recognized both as erotic love, and as a phenomenon that is capable of inspiring courage, valor, great deeds and works, and vanquishing man’s natural fear of death.  It is seen as transcending its earthly origins, and attaining spiritual heights. This extraordinary elevation of the concept of love raises a question of whether some of the most extreme extents of meaning might be intended as humor or farce. ''Eros'' is almost always translated as “love”, and the English word has its own varieties and ambiguities that provide additional challenges to the effort to understand the ''Eros'' of ancient Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Leo. ''On Plato’s Symposium''. University of Chicago Press (2001).  {{ISBN|0226776859}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plato. Cobb 1993"&gt;Plato. Cobb, William S. trans. &amp; editor. ''The Symposium and the Phaedrus: Plato's Erotic Dialogues''. SUNY Press, 1993. {{ISBN|9780791416174}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The event depicted in the ''Symposium'' is a banquet attended by a group of men, who have come to the [[symposium]], which was, in ancient Greece, a traditional part of the same banquet that took place after the meal, when drinking for pleasure was accompanied by music, dancing, recitals, or conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, Peter. ''Food and Society in Classical Antiquity''. (Cambridge University Press, 1999) {{ISBN|9780521645881}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The setting means that the participants will be drinking wine; this suggests that the men might be induced to say things they wouldn’t say elsewhere or when sober.  They might speak frankly, or take risks, or be prone to hubris — they might even be inspired to make speeches that are particularly heartfelt and noble.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Leo. ''On Plato’s Symposium''. University of Chicago Press (2001).  {{ISBN|0226776859}}. page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The host has challenged the men to deliver, each in turn, an [[encomium]]{{spaced ndash}}a speech in praise of Love ([[Eros]]). The party takes place at the house of the [[Tragedy#Greek tragedy|tragedian]] [[Agathon]] in [[Athens]].  This [[dialogue]] is one of Plato's major works; it is appreciated for its philosophical content and literary quality.&lt;ref name="Plato. Cobb 1993"/&gt;

==Literary form==
The ''Symposium'' is considered a dialogue – a form used by Plato in more than thirty works – but in fact it is predominantly a series of essay-like speeches from differing points of view. So dialogue plays a smaller role in the ''Symposium'' than it does in Plato’s other dialogues.  With dialogue, Socrates is renowned for his dialectic, which is his ability to ask questions that encourage others to think deeply about what they care about, and articulate their ideas. In the ''Symposium'' the dialectic exists among the speeches: in seeing how the ideas conflict from speech-to-speech, and in the effort to resolve the contradictions and see the philosophy that underlies them all.&lt;ref&gt;Plato. ''Plato’s Symposium''. Bloom, Allan. “The Ladder of Love”. University of Chicago Press (2001). {{ISBN|9780226042756}}. page 57 - 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to understand that the ''Symposium'' is, like all of Plato’s dialogues, fiction.  The characters and the settings are to some degree based on history, but they are not reports of events that actually occurred or words that were actually spoken.  There is no reason to think they were not composed entirely by Plato.  The reader, understanding that Plato was not governed by the historical record, can read the ''Symposium'', and ask why the author, Plato, arranged the story the way he did, and what he meant by including the various aspects of setting, composition, characters, and theme, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Penguin"&gt;Plato, The Symposium. Translation and introduction by Walter Hamilton. Penguin Classics. 1951. {{ISBN|9780140440249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a very long time it was widely believed that Socrates was presented in the dialogues by his admiring disciple, Plato, as an ideal philosopher and ideal human being.  It was thought that what Socrates said was what Plato agreed with or approved of. Then in the late 20th Century another interpretation began to challenge that idea. This new idea  considers that the ''Symposium'' is intended to criticize Socrates, and his philosophy, and to reject certain aspects of his behavior.  It also considers that Socratic philosophy may have lost touch with the actual individual as it devoted itself to abstract principles.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. page 165&lt;/ref&gt;

The above view, attributed to [[Martha Nussbaum]], can however be challenged in favor of the traditional one. The portrayal of Socrates in the ''Symposium'' (for instance his refusal to give in to Alcibiades’ sexual advances) is consistent with the account of Socrates put forward by [[Xenophon]] and the theories that Socrates defends throughout the platonic corpus. Plato shows off his master as a man of high moral standards, unwavered by baser urges and fully committed to the study and practice of proper self-government in both individuals and communities (the so-called "royal science"). The dialogue’s ending constrasts Socrates’ intellectual and emotional self-mastery with Alcibiades’ debauchery and lack of moderation to explain the latter’s reckless political career, disastrous military campaigns and eventual demise. Alcibiades is corrupted by his physical beauty and the advantages thereof ; he ultimately fails to ascend to the Form of Beauty through philosophy.

One critic, James Arieti, considers that the ''Symposium'' resembles a drama, with emotional and dramatic events occurring especially when Alcibiades crashes the banquet. Arieti suggests that it should be studied more as a drama, with a focus on character and actions, and less as an exploration of philosophical ideas. This suggests that the characters speak, as in a play, not as the author, but as themselves. This theory, Arieti has found, reveals how much each of the speakers of the ''Symposium'' resembles the god, Eros, that they each are describing. It may be Plato’s point to suggest that when humankind talks about god, they are drawn towards creating that god in their own image.&lt;ref&gt;Arieti, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Dalby considers the opening pages of the ''Symposium'' the best depiction in any ancient Greek source of the way texts are transmitted by [[oral tradition]] without writing.  It shows how an oral text may have no simple origin, and how it can be passed along by repeated tellings, and by different narrators, and how it can be sometimes verified, and sometimes corrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Dalby|2006|page=19–24}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the symposium is being told by Apollodorus to his friend.  Apollodorus was not himself at the banquet, but he heard the story from Aristodemus, a man who was there.  Also, Apollodorus was able to confirm parts of the story with Socrates himself, who was one of the speakers at the banquet.&lt;ref&gt;Plato.  Edman, Irwin, editor.  ''The Works of Plato''.  Modern Library. The Jowet translation. Simon and Schuster 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; A story that Socrates narrates, when it is his turn to speak, was told to Socrates by a woman named [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]], a philosopher and a priestess.&lt;ref name=Penguin /&gt;

==The ''Symposium'' as a response to Aristophanes==

In ''[[The Frogs]]'', Aristophanes attacks the new tragedy of [[Agathon]] and [[Euripides]], opposing it to the old tragedy of [[Aeschylus]].  In Aristophanes’ comedy, Dionysus, the god of theatre and wine, descends into Hades and observes a heated dispute between Aeschylus and Euripides over who is the best in tragedy.  Dionysus is engaged to be the judge, and decides the outcome, not based on the merits of the two tragedians, but based on their political stance regarding the political figure, Alcibiades.  Since Aeschylus prefers Alcibiades, Dionysus declares Aeschylus the winner.  That contest provides the basic structure on which the ''Symposium'' is modeled as a kind of sequel:  In the ''Symposium'' Agathon has just celebrated a victory the day before, and is now hosting another kind of debate, this time it is between a tragedian, a comic poet, and Socrates.  At the beginning of the ''Symposium'' Agathon asserts that “Dionysus will be the judge”, and Dionysus is, though Alcibiades performs as surrogate for the god.  So the character, Alcibiades, who was the deciding factor in the debate in ''The Frogs'', becomes the judge in the ''Symposium'', and he now rules in favor of Socrates, who had been attacked by Aristophanes in ''The Clouds''.  The Symposium is a response to ''The Frogs'', and shows Socrates winning not only over Aristophanes, who was the author of both ''The Frogs'', and "The Clouds," but also over the tragic poet who was portrayed in that comedy as the victor.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Leo.  ''On Plato’s Symposium''. University of Chicago Press (2001). {{ISBN|0226776859}}. page 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Laurence D. ''Eros in Plato, Rousseau, and Nietzsche: The Politics of Infinity''. Penn State Press, 2010. {{ISBN|9780271046143}}. page 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristophanes. ''Aristophanes: Frogs and Other Plays''. Oxford University Press, 2015. {{ISBN|9780191066245}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
It is considered that the work was written no earlier than 385 BCE, and the party to which it makes reference has been fixed in 416 BCE, the year in which the host [[Agathon]] had the dramatic triumph mentioned in the text. The disastrous expedition to [[Sicilian expedition|Syracuse]], of which [[Alcibiades]] was a commander, took place the following year&lt;ref&gt;Mary P. Nichols, ''Philosophy and Empire: On Socrates and Alcibiades in Plato's "Symposium"'', Polity, Vol. 39, No. 4 (Oct., 2007), pp. 502-521.&lt;/ref&gt;, after which Alcibiades deserted to [[Sparta]], [[Classical Athens|Athens]]' archenemy.

[[Walter Hamilton (Master of Magdalene College)|Hamilton]] remarks that Plato takes care to portray Alcibiades and Socrates and their relationship in a way that makes it clear that Socrates had not been a bad influence on Alcibiades. Plato does this to free his teacher from the guilt of corrupting the minds of prominent youths, which had in fact earned Socrates the death sentence in 399 BC.&lt;ref name=Penguin /&gt;

== Opening narrative ==
The story of the banquet is narrated by Apollodorus, but before the narration proper begins, it is shown that Apollodorus is telling the story to a friend of his that isn’t named, and also that the story of this banquet has been told before by others, as well as previously by Apollodorus himself. This section previews the story of the banquet, letting the reader know what to expect, and it provides information regarding the context and the date. The banquet was hosted by the poet [[Agathon]] to celebrate his first victory in a dramatic competition: the  [[Dionysia]] of 416 BCE. Apollodorus was not present at the event, which occurred when he was a boy, but he heard the story from [[Aristodemus of Cydathenaeum|Aristodemus]], who was present. Apollodorus later checked parts of the story with Socrates, who was also there. In this brief introductory passage it is shown that the narrator, Apollodorus, has a reputation for being somewhat mad, that he is a passionate follower of Socrates, and that he spends his days either listening to Socrates or else telling others of what he has learned from Socrates. The story, as told by Apollodorus, then moves to the banquet at Agathon’s home, where Agathon challenges each of the men to speak in praise of the Greek god, Eros.&lt;ref name=Penguin /&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[File:Plato's Symposium - Anselm Feuerbach - Google Cultural Institute.jpg|thumbnail|333px|  Plato's Symposium, depiction by  [[Anselm Feuerbach]]  ]]
Apollodorus tells to his friend a story of a symposium, or banquet, that was hosted by the playwright Agathon to celebrate his victory in a dramatic festival the night before. Socrates is late to arrive, after he became lost in thought on the porch of a nearby neighbor.  When they are done eating, Eryximachus takes the suggestion made by Phaedrus, that they should all make a speech in praise of Eros, the god of love and desire.  It will be a competition of speeches to be judged by Dionysus.  It is anticipated that the speeches will ultimately be bested by Socrates, who speaks last.

Phaedrus starts by pointing out that Eros is the oldest of the gods, and that Eros promotes virtue in people&lt;ref&gt;F. C. White, ''Virtue in Plato's "Symposium"'', The Classical Quarterly, New Series, Vol. 54, No. 2 (Dec., 2004), pp. 366-378.&lt;/ref&gt;. Pausanias is next, and he contrasts common desire with a “heavenly” love in the form of pederasty, which occurs between a man and a young boy; and in which the boy gives sexual pleasure, and in return gains knowledge and virtue.  Next Eryximachus speaks, and suggests that Eros encourages  “sophrosyne”, or soundness of mind and character, and is not only about human behavior, but also occurs in music, medicine, and many other areas of life.

Next is Aristophanes, the comic playwright. Aristophanes tells a fantastical, mythological story about how humans were at one time twice the people that they are now, but this was seen as threatening to the gods, so Zeus cut everyone in half. And ever since, humans go about in search of their other half, in order to become whole. Agathon, the host, follows Aristophanes, and his speech sees Eros as youthful, beautiful, and wise; and as the source of all human virtues.

Socrates asks questions of Agathon: has he referred to the object of love, or love itself? Socrates then relates a story he was told by a wise woman called Diotima. According to her, Eros is not a god, but is a spirit that mediates between humans and their objects of desire. Love itself is not wise or beautiful, but is the desire for those things. Love is expressed through propagation and reproduction: either physical love or the exchanging and reproducing of ideas. The greatest knowledge, Diotima says, is knowledge of the “form of beauty”, which humans must try to achieve.

When Socrates is nearly done, Dionysus, who is to judge the speeches, arrives, in the person of Alcibiades.   Alcibiades crashes in, terribly drunk, and delivers a encomium to Socrates himself. No matter how hard he has tried, he says, he has never been able to seduce Socrates, because Socrates has no interest in physical pleasure.

Under the influence of Dionysus, who is now in attendance, the party becomes wild and drunken. Aristodemus goes to sleep. When he wakes up the next morning Socrates is still talking and debating. Soon everyone at last falls asleep, as Socrates rises up and goes off to tend to his daily business as usual.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Leo. ''On Plato’s Symposium''. University of Chicago Press (2001).  {{ISBN|0226776859}}. page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Penguin /&gt;

In order to understand Plato more clearly, it is useful to bear in mind his [[theory of Forms]], according to which all the phenomena perceived by the senses are imitations of eternal and perfect Forms that alone have reality. [[Beauty]] belongs to this category of Forms.&lt;ref name=Penguin /&gt;

==Participants==
The dialogue's seven major speeches are delivered by:
*[[Phaedrus (Athenian)|Phaedrus]] (speech begins 178a):&lt;ref&gt;References to the text of the ''Symposium'' are given in [[Stephanus pagination]], the standard reference system for Plato. This numbering system will be found in the margin of nearly all editions and translations.&lt;/ref&gt; was an Athenian aristocrat associated with the inner-circle of the philosopher Socrates, familiar from ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]'' and other dialogues.
*[[Pausanias (Athenian)|Pausanias]] (speech begins 180c): the [[law|legal]] expert.
*[[Eryximachus]] (speech begins 186a): a [[physician]].
*[[Aristophanes]] (speech begins 189c): the eminent [[Ancient Greek comedy|comic playwright]].
*[[Agathon]] (speech begins 195a): a tragic poet, host of the banquet, that celebrates the triumph of his first [[tragedy]].
*[[Socrates]] (speech begins 201d): the eminent philosopher and Plato's teacher.
*[[Alcibiades]] (speech begins 214e): a prominent Athenian statesman, orator and general.

== The speeches ==
===Phaedrus===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Achilles]] --&gt;
Phaedrus opens by citing [[Hesiod]], [[Acusilaus]] and [[Parmenides]] for the claim that Eros is the oldest of the gods. He confers great benefits, inspiring a lover to earn the admiration of his beloved, for example by showing bravery on the battlefield, since nothing shames a man more than to be seen by his beloved committing an inglorious act (178d-179b). "A handful of such men, fighting side by side, would defeat practically the whole world."&lt;ref name="Translation by W. Hamilton"&gt;Translation by W. Hamilton.&lt;/ref&gt; Lovers sometimes sacrifice their lives for their beloved. As evidence for this he mentions some mythological heroes and lovers. Even [[Achilles]], who was the beloved of [[Patroclus]], sacrificed himself to avenge his lover, and [[Alcestis]] was willing to die for her husband [[Admetus]].

Phaedrus concludes his short speech in proper rhetorical fashion, reiterating his statements that love is one of the most ancient gods, the most honoured, the most powerful in helping men gain honor and blessedness – and sacrificing one's self for love will result in rewards from the gods.

===Pausanias===
[[Image:Symposiumnorthwall.jpg|thumb|left|500px|A [[fresco]] taken from the north wall of the ''[[Tomb of the Diver]]'' (from [[Paestum]], Italy, c. 475 BC): a [[symposium]] scene]]
Pausanias, the legal expert of the group, introduces a distinction between a nobler and a baser kind of love, which anticipates Socrates' discourse. The base lover is in search of sexual gratification, and his objects are women and boys. He is inspired by ''[[Aphrodite|Aphrodite Pandemos]]'' (Aphrodite common to the whole city). The noble lover directs his affection towards young men, establishing lifelong relationships, productive of the benefits described by Phaedrus. This love is related to ''[[Aphrodite Urania]]'' (Heavenly Aphrodite), and is based on honoring one's partner’s intelligence and wisdom.

He then analyses the attitudes of different  citystates relative to homosexuality. The first distinction he makes is between the cities that clearly establish  what is and what is not admitted, and those that are not so explicitly clear, like Athens. In the first group there are cities favorable to homosexuality, like [[Elis]], [[Boeotia]] and [[Sparta]], or unfavorable to it like [[Ionia]] and [[Persia]]. The case of Athens is analyzed with many examples of what would be acceptable and what would not, and at the end he makes the assertion that Athens' code of behaviour favors the nobler type of love and discourages the baser.&lt;ref name="Translation by W. Hamilton" /&gt;

===Eryximachus===
Eryximachus  speaks next, though it is Aristophanes' turn, as the latter has not recovered from his hiccups enough to take his place in the sequence. First Eryximachus  starts out by claiming that love affects everything in the universe, including plants and animals, believing that once love is attained it should be protected&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Edelstein, ''The Rôle of Eryximachus in Plato's Symposium'', Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, Vol. 76 (1945), pp. 85-103.&lt;/ref&gt;. The god of Love not only directs everything on the human plane, but also on the divine (186b). Two forms of love occur in the human body – one is healthy, the other unhealthy (186bc). Love might be capable of curing the diseased.  Love governs medicine, music and astronomy (187a), and regulates hot and cold and wet and dry, which when in balance  result in health (188a). Eryximachus here evokes the theory of the humors. He concludes: "Love as a whole has ... total ... power ... and is the source of all happiness. It enables us to associate, and be friends, with each other and with the gods" (188d Transl. Gill). He comes across as someone who cannot resist the temptation to praise his own profession: “a good practitioner knows how to treat the body and how to transform its desires" (186d).

===Aristophanes===
W. Hamilton considers that  Aristophanes' speech, which comes next, is one of Plato's most brilliant literary achievements.&lt;ref name="Translation by W. Hamilton" /&gt;  The speech has become a focus of subsequent scholarly debate, as it has been seen as mere comic relief, and sometimes as [[satire]]: the [[creation myth]] Aristophanes puts forward to account for sexuality may be read as poking fun at the myths concerning the origins of humanity, numerous in classical  [[Greek mythology]].

Before starting his speech, Aristophanes warns the group that his [[eulogy]] to love may be more absurd than funny. His speech is an explanation of why people in love say they feel "whole" when they have found their love partner. He begins by explaining that people must understand human nature before they can interpret the origins of love and how it affects their own times. This is, he says, because in primal times people had double bodies, with faces and limbs turned away from one another. As  spherical creatures who wheeled around like clowns doing cartwheels (190a), these original people were very powerful. There were three sexes: the all male, the all female, and the "androgynous," who was half male, half female. The males were said to have descended from the sun, the females from the earth and the androgynous couples from the moon. These creatures tried to scale the heights of Olympus and planned to set upon the gods (190b-c).  Zeus thought about blasting them  with thunderbolts, but did not want to deprive himself of their devotions and offerings, so he decided to cripple them by chopping them in half, in effect separating the two bodies.

Ever since that time, people run around saying they are looking for their other half because they are really trying to recover their primal nature. The women who were separated from women run after their own kind, thus creating lesbians. The men split from other men also run after their own kind and love being embraced by other men (191e). Those that come from original androgynous beings are the men and women that engage in heterosexual love. He says some people think homosexuals are shameless, but he thinks they are the bravest, most manly of all, as evidenced by the fact that only they grow up to be politicians (192a), and that many heterosexuals are adulterous and unfaithful (191e). Aristophanes then claims that when two people who were separated from each other find each other, they never again want to be separated (192c). This feeling is like a riddle, and cannot be explained.  Aristophanes ends on a cautionary note.  He says that men should fear the gods, and not neglect to worship them, lest they wield the axe again and we have to go about hopping on one leg, split apart again(193a). If man works with the god of Love, they will escape this fate and instead find wholeness.

===Agathon===
His speech may be regarded as self-consciously poetic and rhetorical, composed in the way of the sophists,&lt;ref name="Translation by W. Hamilton" /&gt;  gently mocked by Socrates.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Stanton notes a deliberate blurring of genre boundaries here ("Aristophanes gives a tragic speech, Agathon a comic/parodic one") and that Socrates later urges a similar coalescence:[http://www.columbia.edu/~rjs19/symp-plan.htm ].&lt;/ref&gt;
Agathon complains that the previous speakers have made the mistake of congratulating mankind on the blessings of love, failing to give due praise to the god himself (194e). He says that love is the youngest of gods and is an enemy of old age (195b).  He says that the god of love shuns the very sight of senility and clings to youth.  Agathon says love is dainty, and likes to tiptoe through the flowers and never settles where there is no "bud to bloom" (196b). It would seem that none of the characters at the party, with the possible exception of Agathon himself, would be candidates for love's companionship. Socrates, probably the oldest member of the party, seems certain to be ruled out. He also implies that love creates justice, moderation, courage, and wisdom. These are the cardinal virtues in ancient Greece. Although devoid of philosophical content, the speech Plato puts in the mouth of Agathon is a beautifully formal one, and Agathon contributes to the Platonic love theory with the idea that the object of love is beauty.&lt;ref name="Translation by W. Hamilton" /&gt;

===Socrates===
Socrates turns politely to Agathon and with Agathon's cooperation examines his speech.  This is done using a series of questions and answers typical of Plato's Socratic dialogues.  Agathon answers affirmatively to Socrates' line of questioning, thus refuting many of the statements in his previous speech (199d).  After this dialogue with Agathon that establishes the foundation for Plato's theory of love, Socrates repeats  a new dialogue in which a woman of Mantinea, called Diotima, plays the same inquiring/instructing role Socrates has played with Agathon.&lt;ref name="Translation by W. Hamilton" /&gt;

Diotima first explains that Love is a spirit halfway between gods and men and traces his mythological descent as son of "Contrivance" (father) and "Poverty" (mother). Love has attributes from both parents, he is beggarly, harsh and a master of artifice and deception (203d) and is delicately balanced and resourceful (204c). Having been born at Aphrodite’s birthday party he became her follower and servant, and consequently is a lover of beauty, but since wisdom is one of the most beautiful things, he is a lover of wisdom too.&lt;ref name="Translation by W. Hamilton"/&gt;

Then Diotima moves to the definition of the aim of love as “the perpetual possession of what is good”. Lovers are pregnant with what is good and attain immortality through procreation, either intellectual or physical.

In the conclusion of her exposition Diotima explains that men should make an ascent to arrive at the discovery of the Ideal Form of Beauty. Men should start with the love of a particular beautiful person. The next step is to pass from this particular instance to beauty in general, and from physical to moral beauty. The fourth step is to attain the love of wisdom, and then from this to the appreciation of the absolute and divine beauty (the Form of Beauty).&lt;ref name="Translation by W. Hamilton" /&gt;

This speech, in the interpretation of [[Marsilio Ficino]] in ''De amore'' (1484), is the origin of the concept of [[Platonic love]].

===Alcibiades===
[[File:Detail of Alcibiades from Alcibiades Being Taught by Socrates (1776) by François-André Vincent.jpg|thumb|Detail of [[Alcibiades]] from the painting ''Alcibiades Being Taught by Socrates'' (1776) by [[François-André Vincent]]]]

Entering upon the scene late and inebriated, he pays tribute to Socrates. Like Agathon and Aristophanes, [[Alcibiades]] is a historical person from ancient Athens. A year after the events of the ''Symposium'', his political enemies would drive him to flee Athens under fear of being sentenced to death for [[sacrilege]] and turn traitor to the Spartans.&lt;ref name="Th6.74"&gt;Thucydides, [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 6#6:74|6.74]]&lt;/ref&gt; By his own admission, he is very handsome.

Finding himself seated on a couch with Socrates and Agathon, Alcibiades exclaims that Socrates, again, has managed to sit next to the handsomest man in the room, Agathon, and that he is always doing such things (213c). Socrates asks Agathon to protect him from the jealous rage of Alcibiades, asking Alcibiades to forgive him (213d). Alcibiades says he will never do such a thing (213e). Wondering why everyone seems sober, Alcibiades is informed of the night's agreement (213e, c); after saying his drunken ramblings should not be placed next to the sober orations of the rest, and that he hopes no one believed a word Socrates said, Alcibiades proposes to offer an encomium to Socrates (214c-e).

Alcibiades begins by comparing Socrates to a statue of [[Silenus]]; the statue is ugly and hollow, and inside it is full of tiny golden statues of the gods (215a-b). He then compares Socrates to a [[satyr]]&lt;ref&gt;Satyrs were often portrayed with the sexual appetite, manners, and features of wild beasts, and often with a large erection.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marsyas]]; Socrates, however, needs no flute to "cast his spell" on people as Marsyas did — he needs only his words (215b-d).

Alcibiades states that when he hears Socrates speak, he feels overwhelmed. The words of Socrates are the only ones to have ever upset him so deeply that his soul started to realize that his aristocratic life was no better than a slave's (215e). Socrates is the only man who has ever made Alcibiades feel shame (216b). Yet all this is the least of it (216c)- Socrates is mad about beautiful boys, following them around in a daze (216d). Most people, he continues, don't know what Socrates is like on the inside:

:''But once I caught him when he was open like Silenus' statues, and I had a glimpse of the figures he keeps hidden within: they were so godlike – so bright and beautiful, so utterly amazing – that I no longer had a choice. I just had to do whatever he told me.''
::''Symposium'' 216e-217a.

Alcibiades thought at the time that Socrates really only wanted him sexually, and by letting Socrates have his way with him he would entice Socrates to teach him everything he knew (217a). Yet Socrates made no move, and Alcibiades began to pursue Socrates "as if I were the lover and he my young prey!" (217c). When Socrates continually rebuffed him, Alcibiades began to view Socrates as the only true and worthy lover he had ever had. So he told Socrates that it seemed to him now that nothing could be more important than becoming the best man he could be, and Socrates was best fit to help him reach that aim (218c-d). Socrates responded that if he did have this power, why would he exchange his true (inner) beauty for the image of beauty that Alcibiades would provide. Furthermore, Alcibiades might be wrong and Socrates may be of no use to him (218e-219a). Alcibiades spent the night sleeping beside Socrates yet, to the deep humiliation of Alcibiades, Socrates made no sexual attempt (219b-d).

In his speech, Alcibiades goes on to describe Socrates' virtues, his incomparable valor in battle, his immunity to cold or fear. On one occasion he even saved Alcibiades' life and then refused to accept honors for it (219e-221c). Socrates, he concludes, is unique in his ideas and accomplishments, unrivaled by any man from the past or present (221c). But be warned: Socrates may present himself as your lover, but before you know it you will have fallen in love with him.

===The conclusion===
Despite this speech, Agathon then lies down next to Socrates, much to the chagrin of Alcibiades.  The symposium comes to an end when a large drunken group shows up. Many of the main characters take the opportunity to depart and return home; Socrates, however, stays awake until dawn. As Aristodemus wakes up and leaves the house, Socrates is proclaiming to Agathon and Aristophanes that a skilful playwright should be able to write comedy as well as tragedy (223d). When Agathon and Aristophanes at last fall asleep, Socrates leaves, walks to the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] to wash, and spends the rest of the day as he usually did, not going home to sleep until that evening (223d).

{{nihongo|'''''The Anatomy of Dependence'''''|甘えの構造|''Amae no Kōzō''}} is a non-fiction book written by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[psychoanalyst]] [[Takeo Doi]], discussing at length Doi's concept of ''amae'', which he describes as a uniquely Japanese need to be in good favor with, and be able to depend on, the people around oneself. He likens this to behaving childishly in the assumption that parents will indulge you (Doi 2001:16), and claims that the ideal relationship is that of the parent-child, and all other relationships should strive for this degree of closeness (Doi 2001:39).

==Main concept==
'''''Amae''''' ({{lang|ja|甘え}}) is the nominal form of the verb ''amaeru'', which Doi uses to describe the behavior of a person attempting to induce an authority figure, such as a parent, spouse, teacher, or supervisor, to take care of him. The word is rarely used of oneself, but rather is applied descriptively to the behavior of other people. The person who is carrying out ''amae'' may beg or plead, or alternatively act selfishly while secure in the knowledge that the caregiver will indulge them. The behavior of children towards their parents is perhaps the most common example of ''amae'', but Doi argued that child-rearing practices in the Western world seek to stop this kind of dependence, whereas in Japan it persists into adulthood in all kinds of social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Electronic Journal of Sociology |year=2000 |url=http://www.sociology.org/content/vol005.001/smith-nomi.html |title=Is ''amae'' the Key to Understanding Japanese Culture? |author=Herman W Smith &amp; Takako Nomi |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220062826/http://www.sociology.org/content/vol005.001/smith-nomi.html |archivedate=2014-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In literary context===
Doi developed this idea to explain and describe many kinds of Japanese behavior. However, Doi states that while ''amae'' is not just a Japanese phenomenon, the Japanese are the only people known to have an extensive vocabulary for describing it. The reason for this is that ''amae'' is a major factor in Japanese interaction and customs.&lt;ref name="Doi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Doi |first=Takeo |title=The Anatomy of Dependence: The Key Analysis of Japanese Behavior |year=1981 |edition=2nd |publisher=Kodansha International |location=Tokyo |others=English trans. John Bester}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doi argues that nonverbal empathic guesswork (''sasshi'' {{lang|ja|察し}}), a fondness for unanimous agreement in decision-making, the ambiguity and hesitation of self-expression (''enryo'' {{lang|ja|遠慮}}), and the [[Tatemae and Honne|''tatemae–honne'']] dynamics are communicative manifestations of the ''amae'' psychology of Japanese people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Keio Communication Review |volume=25 |pages=93–115 |year=2003 |url=http://www.mediacom.keio.ac.jp/publication/pdf2003/review25/7.pdf |title=Japanese ''Enryo–Sasshi'' Communication and the Psychology of ''Amae'': Reconsideration and Reconceptualization |author=Yoshitaka Miike}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Doi translates ''amaeru'' as "to depend and presume upon another's benevolence". It indicates, for Doi, "helplessness and the desire to be loved". ''Amaeru'' can also be defined as "to wish to be loved", and denotes [[dependency need]]s. ''Amae'' is, in essence, a request for indulgence of one's perceived needs.

Doi says,
{{quote|"The psychological prototype of 'amae' lies in the psychology of the infant in its relationship to its mother; not a newborn infant, but an infant who has already realised that its mother exists independently of itself&amp;nbsp;... [A]s its mind develops it gradually realises that itself and its mother are independent existences, and comes to feel the mother as something indispensable to itself, it is the craving for close contact thus developed that constitutes, one might say, amae."&lt;ref name="Doi"/&gt;}}

According to Doi and others, in Japan the kind of relationship based on this prototype provides a model of human relationships in general, especially (though not exclusively) when one person is senior to another. As another writer puts it:
{{quote|"He may be your father or your older brother or sister ... But he may just as well be your section head at the office, the leader of your local political faction, or simply a fellow struggler down life's byways who happened to be one or two years ahead of you at school or the university. The amae syndrome is pervasive in Japanese life."&lt;ref name="Gibney"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibney |first=Frank |title= Japan: The Fragile Superpower |year=1975 |publisher=Norton |isbn=0-393-05530-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Amae'' may also be used to describe the behavior of a husband who comes home drunk and depends on his wife to get him ready for bed. In Japan, ''amae'' does have a connotation of [[maturity (psychology)|immaturity]], but it is also recognized as a key ingredient in loving relationships, perhaps more so than the notions of [[romantic love|romance]] so common in the West.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Critical reception===
Doi's work has been heavily criticized by academics specializing in [[nihonjinron]] studies as being anecdotal and full of inaccuracies. (See Dale, P. 1986 The Myth of Japanese Uniqueness, Mouer and Sugimoto 1986, 1982, Kubota 1999)

Doi's work has been hailed as a distinctive contribution to psychoanalysis by the American psychiatrist [[Frank A. Johnson|Frank Johnson]], who has devoted a full book-length study to Doi and to his critics.&lt;ref&gt;Frank A. Johnson,''Dependency and Japanese socialization: psychoanalytic and anthropological investigations into amae'', 1993 New York, New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Master and His Emissary: The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World''''' is a 2009 book written by [[Iain McGilchrist]] that deals with the specialist [[Lateralization of brain function|hemispheric functioning]] of the brain. The differing world views of the right and left brain (the "Master" and "Emissary" in the title, respectively) have, according to the author, shaped Western culture since the time of the [[Classical Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Plato]], and the growing conflict between these views has implications for the way the modern world is changing.&lt;ref name="BBCRadio4Today"&gt;{{cite news

==Background and influences==
In an interview with ''Frontier Psychiatrist'', McGilchrist cites two main influences on his work: the psychiatrist [[John Cutting (psychiatrist)|John Cutting]], and the Chicago psychologist [[David McNeill]]. McGilchrist states: "What I began to see – and it was John Cutting's work on the right hemisphere that set me thinking – was that the difference lay not in what they [the two hemispheres] do, but how they do it."&lt;ref name="FrontierPsychiatrist"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview, the author explains: "Some very subtle research by David McNeill, amongst others, confirms that thought originates in the right hemisphere, is processed for expression in speech by the left hemisphere, and the meaning integrated again by the right (which alone understands the overall meaning of a complex utterance, taking everything into account)."&lt;ref name="FrontierPsychiatrist"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
The 608-page book is divided into an introduction, two parts and a conclusion. In the introduction, McGilchrist states that "there is, literally, a world of difference between the [brain] hemispheres. Understanding quite what that is has involved a journey through many apparently unrelated areas: not just neurology and psychology, but philosophy, literature and the arts, and even, to some extent, archaeology and anthropology."&lt;ref name="Mc_2"&gt;{{harvnb |McGilchrist|2009| p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part One: The Divided Brain===
[[File:Human brain superior-lateral view.JPG|thumb|200px|Superior-lateral view of the brain, showing left and right hemispheres.]]

In "The Divided Brain", McGilchrist digests study after study, replacing the popular and superficial notion of the hemispheres as respectively logical and creative in nature with the idea that they pay attention in fundamentally different ways, the left being detail-oriented, the right being whole-oriented. These two modes of perception cascade into wildly different hemispheric personalities, and in fact reflect yet a further asymmetry in their status, that of the right's more immediate relationship with physical bodies (our own as well as others) and external reality as represented by the senses, a relationship that makes it the mediator, the first and last stop, of all experience.

===Part Two: How the Brain Has Shaped Our World===
In the second part, "How the Brain Has Shaped Our World", the author describes the evolution of Western culture, as influenced by hemispheric brain functioning, from the ancient world, through the [[Renaissance]] and [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]; the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]; [[Romanticism]] and [[Industrial Revolution]]; to the modern and [[Postmodernity|postmodern]] worlds which, to our detriment, are becoming increasingly dominated by the left brain.

==Reception==
The book received mixed reviews in various newspapers and journals. 
Reviewing ''The Master and His Emissary'' in the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'', Jacob Freedman wrote the book “valiantly addresses the effect hemispheric asymmetry has had on Western civilization" and that it chronicled "how the left brain's determined [[reductionism]] and the right brain's insightful and holistic approach have shaped music, language, politics, and art."&lt;ref name="AmericanJournalPsychiatryFreedman"&gt;{{cite journal

In a mixed review in ''[[Literary Review]]'', [[A. C. Grayling]] wrote that the book was "beautifully written, erudite, fascinating and adventurous", but added that "the findings of brain science are nowhere near fine-grained enough yet to support the large psychological and cultural conclusions Iain McGilchrist draws".&lt;ref name="LiteraryReviewGrayling"/&gt; A negative review in ''[[The Economist]]'' stated that the book resorted to "generalisations of breathtaking sweep" and that the second part of the book "has plainly become untethered from its moorings in brain science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.economist.com/node/14959719 |title=The human brain: Right and left |publisher=The Economist |date=26 November 2009 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Michael Corbalis said of the work, that "Although widely acclaimed, this book goes far beyond the neurological facts." &lt;ref&gt;Corbalis, 2014.

[[Owen Flanagan]] alleged many shortcomings of the book and delivered a dismissive statement: "The fact is, hemispheric differences are not well understood. Neither are patterns over 2,500 years of western history. Trying to explain the ill-understood latter with a caricature of the former does little to illuminate either".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Flanagan, Owen |url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2009/12/the-left-brain-plot-for-world-domination.php?DCMP=OTC-rss&amp;nsref=online-news|title=The vast left-brain conspiracy |publisher=New Scientist CultureLab blog |date=26 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McGilchrist wrote scathingly of this review, saying: "But anyone who has read my book and reads that review will realise what a shameful piece of writing it is", picking on what he alleges to be evidence of superficiality and misrepresentation.&lt;ref name="pandaemonium"&gt;{{cite news

'''Thomas Abbt''' ({{IPA-de|apt|lang}}; 25 November 1738 – 3 November 1766) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] and writer.

==Biography==
Born in [[Ulm]] as the son of a wig-maker,&lt;ref name="Garland1976"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garland|first1=Henry Burnand|last2=Garland|first2=Mary|title=The Oxford Companion to German Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=63PErQEACAAJ|year=1976|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-866115-3|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbt visited a secondary school in Ulm, then moved in 1756 to study theology,  philosophy and mathematics at the [[University of Halle]], receiving a Magister degree in 1758. In 1760 he was appointed as an associate professor of philosophy at the [[University of Frankfurt (Oder)]], where he wrote his most well-known work ''Vom Tode für's Vaterland'' (1761).&lt;ref name="Garland1976" /&gt;

This highly patriotic tract thematises [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]]'s defeat at [[Battle of Kunersdorf|Kunersdorf]]. It also drew the attention of the editors of the famous ''Literaturbriefe (Literary Letters)'', started by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]. He contributed a large number of historical, political, esthetical and philosophical essays. Abbt was a fervent admirer of Lessing and seconded his educational, prosaic style of writing.

In autumn 1761 he was appointed as full professor of mathematics in [[Rinteln]].&lt;ref name="Garland1976" /&gt; In 1763, he entered a competition that was sponsored by the Berlin Academy for an essay on the application of mathematical proofs to metaphysics. Among the competitors were [[Moses Mendelssohn]], who won, and [[Immanuel Kant]]. While in Rinteln, Abbt wrote his other famous work, ''Vom Verdienste'' (1765).&lt;ref name="Garland1976" /&gt;

He travelled for nine months to [[France]], where he was able to speak with [[Voltaire]] in [[Ferney]]. He also climbed in the Alps of [[Savoy]]. This travel and the disapproval of the life at the university raised his urge to ''trade the Theory for the Life''.

While dealing with the idea to become a historian, he was offered in 1765 at the same time a professorship at the [[University of Marburg]] and a post as Councillor of the Court at the court of [[Count Wilhelm von Schaumburg-Lippe]]. He decided for the latter. The count was highly interested in the plans of Thomas Abbt, which included a history of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]] and a translation of [[Sallust]] among others.

However in 1766, the twenty-seven-year-old Abbt suddenly died of an intestinal illness in [[Bückeburg]]. Of him [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] wrote that he "died for Germany and for his language too early!"&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin W. Redekop, ''Enlightenment and Community'', McGill-Queen's University Press, 2000, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[semantics]] and [[Pragmatics|pragmatics]], a '''truth condition''' is the condition under which a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] is [[wikt:true|true]]. For example, "It is snowing in Nebraska" is true precisely when it is snowing in Nebraska. Truth conditions of a sentence don't necessarily reflect current reality. They are merely the conditions under which the statement would be true.&lt;ref&gt;Birner, Betty J. Introduction to Pragmatics.  2013. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

More formally, a truth condition makes for the truth of a sentence in an [[inductive definition]] of truth (for details, see the [[semantic theory of truth]]). Understood this way, truth conditions are [[theoretical entities]]. To illustrate with an example: suppose that, in a particular truth theory&lt;ref&gt;Field, H. (1972). Tarski's Theory of Truth. ''The Journal of Philosophy,'' ''69''(13), 347-375. doi:10.2307/2024879&lt;/ref&gt; which is a theory of truth where truth is somehow made acceptable despite semantic terms as close as possible, the word "Nixon" [[reference|refers]] to [[Richard M. Nixon]], and "is alive" is associated with the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of currently [[Living Thing|living things]]. Then one way of representing the truth condition of "Nixon is alive" is as the [[ordered pair]] &lt;Nixon, {x: x is alive}&gt;. And we say that "Nixon is alive" is true if and only if the referent (or referent of) "Nixon" belongs to the set associated with "is alive", that is, if and only if Nixon is alive.

In [[semantics]], the truth condition of a sentence is almost universally considered distinct from its [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. The meaning of a sentence is conveyed if the truth conditions for the sentence are understood. Additionally, there are many sentences that are understood although their truth condition is [[Uncertainty|uncertain]]. One popular argument for this view is that some sentences are [[logical truth|necessarily true]] — that is, they are true whatever happens to obtain. All such sentences have the same truth conditions, but arguably do not thereby have the same meaning. Likewise, the sets {x: x is alive} and {x: x is alive and x is not a rock} are identical — they have precisely the same members — but presumably the sentences "Nixon is alive" and "Nixon is alive and is not a rock" have different meanings.

In [[Jain Philosophy|Jain tradition]], '''twelve contemplations''', ([[Prakrit]]: बारस अणुवेक्खा ) are the twelve mental reflections that a [[Jain monasticism|Jain ascetic]] and a [[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|practitioner]] should repeatedly engage into. These twelve contemplations are also known as ''Barah anuprekśa'' or ''Barah bhāvana''. According to [[Jain Philosophy]], these twelve contemplations pertain to eternal truths like nature of universe, human existence, and [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] on which one must meditate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2001|pp=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve contemplations is an important topic that has been developed at all epochs of [[Jain literature]]. They are regarded as summarising fundamental teachings of the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Caillat|2008|pp=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoppage of new Karma is called ''[[Samvara]]''. Constant engagement on these twelve contemplations help the soul in ''samvara'' or stoppage of karmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Umasvati|2006|pp=223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prabhacandra|2012|pp=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Twelve Contemplations ==
Following are twelve Anupreksas or bhavanas that one must constantly reflect or contemplate upon:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2001|pp=248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sangave|2001|pp=237–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ol start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Anitya'' – Impermanence (of everything), that is, contemplation on the fact that everything in this world including relations are transient and fleeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Asharana'' – Helplessness (against our karma). The soul is helpless against its own karma.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Ekatva'' – Solitariness (of the soul), that is, acceptance of the fact that I am alone in the world and alone will suffer or enjoy the consequences of my Karma.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Anyatva'' Distinctiveness (of the self from everything else). The knowledge that the world, my kinsmen, my body, my mind, all are distinct from my real self i.e. the soul.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|Samsara]]'' – (inevitability of) transmigration, reflection of the fact that soul is ensnared in the continuous and sorrowful cycle of birth and death and cannot attain true happiness till it ends this cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''[[Loka]]'' – (the nature of) Universe, that is, contemplation on the fundamental truths about the universe that it is beginningless, uncreated and operates according to its own laws—there is no divine omnipotent being responsible for the Universe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Ashucitva'' – Impurity (of soul, on account of its association with karma) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''[[Asrava]]'' – Influx of karma. Reflection of the fact that inflow of karmas is the cause of my mundane existence and there is no liberation as long as my soul is associated with karmas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''[[Samvara]]'' – Cessation of karmic inflow, that is, contemplation on the stoppage of karmic inflow by cultivating necessary virtues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''[[Nirjara]]'' – Shedding of karma, that is, shedding or destruction of karmas by penances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Dharmasvakhyata'' – path of righteousness, Reflection on the true nature of the path to righteousness based on true teachings of Jina through various practices like Ahimsa and non-attachment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Bodhidurlabha''  – Rarity of finding the right path to enlightenment. Reflection on the fact that true enlightenment is very rare and many souls are deprived of moksha or liberation due to failure to reincarnate as human and attain true teachings of the Jina.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

== Importance of Twelve Contemplations ==
Twelve Contemplations or ''anupreksa'' is an important tool for meditation. In Yogasastra, Hemcandra gives great importance to the twelve contemplations since constant reflections on these ''bhavanas'' results in detachment in worldly matters which in turn results in equanimity. With equanimity, passions (kasaya) are eliminated resulting in mental purity. This finally culminates into knowledge of self.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hemacandra|2012|pp=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, these twelve contemplations are also one of the reasons for stoppage of influx of karmas as they regulate our thoughts and physical actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Umasvati|2006|pp=223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Important texts detailing twelve contemplations ==
*Barasa Anuvekkha, a 2nd Century CE text by Acarya [[Kundakunda]]. It is a short Prakrit text of 90 gathas focusing on the spiritual aspects of meditation. Kundakunda shows how leading the mind in a certain direction will held develop detachment from worldly entanglements, thus helping the soul progress on the path of liberation. Muni Pranamyasagar has written the first and only commentary on it. It has been written in ''Kādambini'' style in Sanskrit language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Muni Pranamyasagar|title=बारसाणुवेक्खा|trans-title=Baras Anuvekkha|publisher=Arhat Vidyaprakashan GoteGanv|pages=790}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Tattvarthasutra]], a 2nd Century CE text  by [[Umasvati]]. 
*Yogasastra, a 12th Century CE text by Acarya [[Hemacandra]]. Hemacandra devotes a chapter on these contemplations in his Sanskrit text, Yogasastra. 
*Maranavibhatti or Maranasamahi Painnayam – (gathas 570 – 640)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2796">The '''World Friendship Crusade''' is an international civil organization that campaigns in favor of [[friendship]] as a way of fostering a [[Peace|culture of peace]]. Founded by Dr. Ramón Artemio Bracho in [[Puerto Pinasco (Paraguay)|Puerto Pinasco, Paraguay]] in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cplavila.blogspot.com/2008/03/resea-histrica-de-la-cruzada-mundial-de.html History of the World Friendship Crusade]&lt;/ref&gt; the World Friendship Crusade celebrates [[Friendship Day]] every July 30.

== World Friendship Crusade in Origin and Mission ==
On July 20, 1958, while out to dinner with friends in the town of Puerto Pinasco, Paraguay, Dr. Ramón Artemio Bracho proposed the idea of a '''World Friendship Day''' to his colleagues. On that night, the World Crusade of Friendship was founded, as an activist organization that would promote the idea of celebrating worldwide friendship on July 30. The organization lobbied the [[United Nations]] for many years,  until finally, on July 27, 2011, the General Assembly of the United Nations assigned this date to celebrate the International [[Friendship Day]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/65/L.72 UN Res.A/65/L.72]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Friendship Day Traditions ==
[[Friendship Day|"Día de la Amistad"]] is celebrated every July 30 in Paraguay, where it is a popular festivity in which it is custom among Paraguayans to salute and wish each other's happiness throughout the day, while also exchanging presents.

Another classic activity during this celebration, particularly among young students, but also among other general groups (coworkers, companies, civil organizations, etc.), is the game of the "invisible friend",&lt;ref&gt;[http://discoveringparaguay.com/home/friendship-day-dia-del-amigo/ Discovering Paraguay: Friendship Day Traditions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoluque.com.py/noticias/49.htm Local report about Paraguayan customs on Friendship Day]&lt;/ref&gt; which is a variation of the popular [[Secret Santa]]. One week before the celebration, participants are invited to write their names on a piece of paper and then, after scrambling all these pieces in a basket or container, retrieve one of the names, without revealing it to the others. Participants then become the "invisible friend" of the person on that piece of paper, and during the week before the celebration, they are invited to write anonymous small notes or letters to the person whose name they selected. On the day of the celebration, invisible friends bring presents to their friends, and one after the other, reveal their identities before giving their presents.

[[Image:CM Zendo Feb 2008.JPG|right|thumb|160px|A typical [[zendo]] where Yaza is performed. This one is at [[Chapin Mill]] ]]

'''Yaza''' is a [[Zen Buddhist]] term for a sitting time during [[sesshin]] that is above and beyond the normal daily routine. It is generally encouraged because it is more difficult to sit at this time when your body is [[exhausted]] from the entire day's routine.

==How to do Yaza==

While most Yaza is performed after the last evening sitting, some is done early in the morning. If the practitioner is too tired to go on at night they can get up a few hours early in the morning. Because no [[alarm clocks]] are used during [[sesshin]] a good way for a person to get up for Yaza is to drink a good deal of water at bed time. This will encourage them to get up when they have to [[urinate]].

'''Étienne Émile Marie Boutroux''' ({{IPA-fr|butʁu|lang}}; July 28, 1845 – November 22, 1921) was an eminent 19th century [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] of [[science]] and [[religion]], and an historian of [[philosophy]]. He was a firm opponent of [[materialism]] in science. He was a spiritual philosopher who defended the idea that religion and science are compatible at a time when the power of science was rising inexorably. His work is overshadowed in the English-speaking world by that of the more celebrated [[Henri Bergson]]. He was elected membership of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences in 1898 and in 1912 to the [[Académie française]].

==Biography==
Émile Boutroux was born at [[Montrouge]], now in the [[Hauts-de-Seine]] ''[[département in France|département]]'', near [[Paris]]. He attended the lycée Napoléon (now [[lycée Henri IV]]), and graduated in 1865 to the [[École Normale Supérieure]]. He then continued his education at [[Heidelberg University]] between 1869–1870 where he was taught by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and encountered German philosophy.

His first employment was the post of philosophy professor at the lycée in [[Caen]]. In 1874 he published his book on which he based his doctoral thesis. ''The Contingency of the laws of the nature'' was an analysis of the implications of [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] philosophy for science.

Between 1874 and 1876 Boutroux taught at the Faculty of Letters at the [[University of Nancy]] and while there he fell in love with and married Aline Poincaré the sister of the scientist and mathematician [[Henri Poincaré]]. In 1880 his son, Pierre, was born. [[Pierre Boutroux]] was himself to become a distinguished mathematician and historian of science.

In 1888 Boutroux was made professor of history of modern philosophy at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in Paris.

He was elected a member of Academy of the Moral and Political Sciences in 1898 and in 1902 he became Director of the Thiers Foundation, a residency for France's brightest students. He was elected to the [[Académie Française]] in 1912.
