The '''2009 Malagasy political crisis''' began on 26 January 2009 with the political opposition movement led by [[Antananarivo]] mayor [[Andry Rajoelina]], which sought to oust [[President of Madagascar|President]] [[Marc Ravalomanana]] from the presidency. The crisis reached its climax on 21 March 2009 when Andry Rajoelina was declared the president of the [[High Transitional Authority]] of Madagascar, five days after Ravalomanana transferred his power to a military council and fled to South Africa.

The international community immediately condemned the leader and his ascension as unconstitutional.  Financial support and foreign investments stopped, and the country fell into one of the worst economic crises in its history. The [[Southern African Development Community|SADC]] and the [[African Union]] have been designated to supervise Madagascar's political reinstatement.

Though the objective of the transitional government was to run presidential elections as soon as possible to relieve the tensions (despite regular delays), its major challenge has been to establish an agreement among Madagascar's four key political factions (Rajoelina, Ravalomanana, [[Albert Zafy|Zafy]] and [[Didier Ratsiraka|Ratsiraka]]), some of which were and still are unfriendly to the transitional government. On 11 December 2010 a new constitution was formally approved, launching the Fourth Republic. On 28 October 2011 a consensus Prime Minister, [[Omer Beriziky]], was appointed. [[Malagasy general election, 2013|Presidential and parliamentary elections]] were scheduled for 8 May and 3 July 2013.

== Origins of the conflict ==
[[File:LocationMadagascar.svg|250px|thumb|Map of Madagascar in Africa]]
In December 2007, Andry Rajoelina was elected mayor of [[Antananarivo]]. Tensions quickly grew between president Ravalomanana and the young mayor over the course of 2008 as Rajoelina became a vocal critic of a series of unpopular policies enacted by the president.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; He condemned what he called the "restriction of freedom" on the island, and criticized the president's plans to lease large parts of land to the [[South Korea|Korean]] industrial company [[Daewoo]].&lt;ref name="first" /&gt;&lt;ref name="second" /&gt;

On 13 December 2008, the Ravalomanana administration decided to shutter Viva TV, a television channel belonging to Rajoelina&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; after broadcasting an interview with the former exiled president Didier Ratsiraka. Other television and radio stations that also aired the interview were not sanctioned.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt;

Andry Rajoelina organized a series of rallies in January 2009 that took aim at the Ravalomanana administration and gave voice to growing popular resentment toward the president's increasingly authoritarian policies and a widespread perception that national development had only benefitted an elite minority of which the president was the most visible figurehead.&lt;ref name="france24" /&gt; As anti-government frustration transformed into civil unrest, two state television stations were burned by anti-government protesters.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt; At least 130 people were killed in Madagascar during the crisis.&lt;ref name="135killed" /&gt; The protests were seen as the gravest challenge faced by the Ravalomanana government since he came to office in 2002.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; President Ravalomanana vowed to restore order "whatever the cost", according to a government statement.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-2" /&gt;

== Protests ==
{{Politics of Madagascar}}
[[File:Madagascar-carte.png|thumb|left|160px|The protests took place in [[Antananarivo]], the capital and largest city in [[Madagascar]].]]
Rajoelina called a general strike during the weekend of 24–25 January 2009, in the capital city, [[Antananarivo]], against Ravalomanana, whom he has called a dictator.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt;&lt;ref name="afp2" /&gt; Ravalomanana, who was in South Africa, cut short his trip to a regional summit in [[Pretoria]], and flew back to Madagascar.&lt;ref name="afp2" /&gt; In a statement Ravalomanana accused the mayor of attempting a coup saying, "The call for [[revolt]] and [[civil disobedience]]... corresponds to a coup d'état...tramples on the values of the constitution and the republic's institutions."&lt;ref name="afp2" /&gt;

On 26 January 2009, the protests turned increasingly violent.&lt;ref name="france24" /&gt; Demonstrators set fire to the Madagascar state-owned radio building, attacked a private television station owned by Ravalomanana and looted shops and businesses throughout the city.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; That same day, armed government [[security agent]]s reportedly disabled the transmitter of Viva Radio, a private radio station owned by Rajoelina.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt;

Protesters ransacked two pro-government television stations in Antananarivo. Thousands of protesters raided and looted the headquarters of the [[Radio Nationale Malgache]] and [[Télévision Nationale Malgache]] building around 1&amp;nbsp;pm local time on 26 January 2009.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt; About an hour later demonstrators burned down the [[Malagasy Broadcasting System]], a private station owned by President Ravalomanana.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt; A policeman and a fourteen-year-old protester were reportedly killed in the clashes at the Malagasy Broadcasting System attacks.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt;

Firefighters found the bodies of at least 25 people in the ruins of a burned out, looted [[department store]] in downtown Antananarivo.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="france24two" /&gt; The bodies were thought to be those of looters who became trapped in the burning shop when the roof caved in.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-4" /&gt; In total, 44 people died. Their bodies were taken to a morgue, and all but ten of them were found to be severely burned.

In a show of defiance against the government, Rajoelina called for all Antananarivo residents to stay home on 29 January 2009.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; This "ghost town" (''ville morte'') protest basically closed all stores and businesses in the capital city.&lt;ref name="bbcnews" /&gt;

The [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Roman Catholic Cardinal]] [[emeritus]] of Antananarivo [[Armand Razafindratandra]] appealed for calm as the protests spread outside of the capital.&lt;ref name="cna" /&gt; All state and private radio stations in the country reportedly ceased broadcasting, with the exception of [[Radio Don Bosco]], which is run by the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian]] [[religious institute]].&lt;ref name=cna/&gt;

Rajoelina said on 31 January that he was taking control of the country due to the failure of Ravalomanana and the government to fulfil their responsibilities.&lt;ref name="bbcnews2" /&gt; He said that a request for Ravalomanana's "immediate resignation" would be submitted to [[Parliament of Madagascar|Parliament]] "in order to comply with the legal procedure". Furthermore, he asked that the [[central bank]] withhold money from the government, that all government ministries close, and that the security forces join him. Rajoelina said that he wanted the constitution to be respected and that it was Ravalomanana who had violated the constitution. According to Rajoelina, a new [[transitional government]] would soon be appointed under his leadership and a new presidential election would be held within two years. Speaking on the same day, Ravalomanana stated that he was "still the president of this country" and that he would "do what is necessary to develop this nation".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-5" /&gt;

The [[African Union]] (AU) immediately warned Rajoelina that it would not accept an unconstitutional power grab in Madagascar: "It's totally forbidden to take power by non-constitutional means."&lt;ref name="reuters2" /&gt;

Opposition leaders allied to Rajoelina filed a petition with the High Constitutional Court on 2 February, asking it to remove Ravalomanana from office. By that point, attendance at Rajoelina's rallies had reportedly decreased.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-6" /&gt; On 3 February, Rajoelina said at a rally that he would announce his new government on 7 February.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-7" /&gt; On the same day, the High Constitutional Court ruled that it had no power to remove the President from office, as that power belonged to Parliament.&lt;ref name="Fired" /&gt; Also on 3 February, Rajoelina was dismissed as Mayor and a special delegation, headed by [[Guy Randrianarisoa]], was appointed instead. Rajoelina denounced the decision, saying that there was "no valid reason" for it and that he was prepared to face arrest if necessary; he warned that the city would "not accept this decision".&lt;ref name="Fired" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-8" /&gt;

Rajoelina held another rally on 4 February, with about 1,500 people in attendance. On that occasion he described the appointment of Randrianarisoa as "an insult to the people of Madagascar"; he instead designated [[Michele Ratsivalaka]] to succeed him as Mayor and gave her his mayoral scarf.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-9" /&gt;

=== Shooting at opposition rally ===
On 7 February, an opposition rally was held with twenty-thousand in attendance.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-10" /&gt; The demonstrators marched towards [[Ambohitsorohitra Palace]] and crossed the "ligne rouge" (red line), the perimeter line around the palace gates that demarcates the zone off-limits to the public. The palace guards responded by firing live ammunition to disperse the crowd. Initial reports counted 83 wounded and 28 people killed, including a local reporter. Some looting was reported afterward.&lt;ref name="Three" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-11" /&gt; Ambulances took the wounded to hospitals or private clinics, and bodies were seen piled up on the streets before they were taken to the morgue. The National Police warned that the death toll could rise, as many of the wounded were in critical condition. The following day it was reported that the death toll had increased to at least 50, with doctors estimating that 180 people had arrived at the city's main [[Ravoahangy Andrianavalona Hospital]].&lt;ref name="Madagascar protesters shot dead" /&gt; Antananarivo journalist [[Fanja Saholiarisoa]] said: "The mortuary is full and the hospital is full. On TV there is a special announcement calling on people who have cars to come and pick up the injured people from the hospitals".&lt;ref name="Madagascar protesters shot dead" /&gt; This brought the number of people killed since the start of the [[political violence]] to 130, with 80 people killed before the shooting of the demonstrators, including the people who died in the burned department store.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-12" /&gt;

Also on 7 February, Rajoelina said that [[Roindefo Monja]] would be prime minister under his transitional authority. According to Rajoelina, each of Madagascar's regions would have representation in the transitional authority. Regarding Ambohitsorohitra Palace, Rajoelina alluded to its history as a mayoral residence prior to 2002 and said that it "belongs to the people and to the city", while declaring that he had decided to give the palace to Monja for his use as prime minister. On the same day, Ravalomanana urged "calm and order", accusing Rajoelina of "cross[ing] all limits", while Prime Minister [[Charles Rabemananjara]] announced a one-week extension of the curfew.&lt;ref name=Three/&gt;

While visiting hospitalized victims of the shooting on 8 February, Rajoelina vowed to continue his struggle and argued that Ravalomanana's answer to the popular call for change was gunfire. He called for a national day of mourning on 9 February.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-13" /&gt;

On 9 February, Defence Minister [[Cécile Manorohanta]] announced her resignation, saying, "After all that has happened, I decide as of now to no longer remain part of this government."&lt;ref name="AutoRI-14" /&gt; Chief of military staff [[Mamy Ranaivoniarivo]] was appointed to replace Manorohanta on the same day.&lt;ref name="Defence" /&gt;

7 February shooting was thought to have reversed the opposition's declining momentum. Newspapers published on 9 February, strongly denounced the shooting.&lt;ref name=Defence/&gt; On 10 February, speaking before a rally of about 5,000 supporters, Rajoelina urged the people to observe a general strike on the next day; he asked that everyone stay indoors and that no one go to work or attend school. Roindefo announced the appointment of four ministers to serve in his transitional government, and he said that the remainder of them would be appointed by the end of the week. Meanwhile, both Ravalomanana and Rajoelina accepted dialogue in principle; Rajoelina said that dialogue would be conditional on the holding of a new presidential election or the formation of a transitional government.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-15" /&gt;

At a 35,000-strong rally in Antananarivo on 14 February, Ravalomanana said that he would serve out his full term as president, that he was listening to the people, and that he regretted the deaths that had occurred during the protests. On the same day, Rajoelina held a rally nearby, with about 10,000 in attendance.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-16" /&gt;

At a rally on 17 February, Rajoelina vowed to continue the struggle, and later in the day several thousand of his supporters engaged in [[sit-in]]s near key ministries. Representing the government, Defense Minister Ranaivoniarivo invited Roindefo to participate in talks.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-17" /&gt; Rajoelina's supporters took over several important ministries on 19 February, changing the locks and installing Rajoelina's own ministers to work in them. Meanwhile, Ravalomanana appointed a new Minister of the Interior, [[Rabenja Sehenoarisoa]] (who had previously served as chief of police in the capital). His predecessor as Interior Minister, [[Gervais Rakotonirina]], was said to have departed the government due to poor health.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-18" /&gt; Only hours after the opposition took over the government ministries, they were removed from the ministries by security forces early on 20 February; about 50 of Rajoelina's supporters were arrested.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-19" /&gt;

Ravalomanana and Rajoelina met on 21 February; this meeting, which lasted about 45 minutes, was organized by the [[Council of Christian Churches in Madagascar]]. Both Ravalomanana and Rajoelina agreed to five points intended to calm the situation. This was intended as a prelude to more comprehensive dialogue.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-20" /&gt; On 23 February the two met again for about an hour,&lt;ref name="AutoRI-21" /&gt; and they held a third meeting, also lasting an hour, on 24 February.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-22" /&gt; However, Ravalomanana failed to appear for a planned meeting on 25 February, and Rajoelina then announced that he was withdrawing from the talks. Rajoelina criticized Ravalomanana for his absence and furthermore stated that the meetings he had held with Ravalomanana prior to that were disappointing. [[Odon Razanakolona]], who had been mediating the talks, abandoned his role shortly before Rajoelina withdrew from the talks; according to Razanakolona, the talks were fruitless and deadlocked.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-23" /&gt;

=== Post-talks ===
A protest in Antananarivo was broken up by the security forces on 26 February. Another protest in [[Fianarantsoa]] on 27 February, was also broken up; two deaths and 13 serious injuries were reported in the latter incident.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-24" /&gt; At a 10,000-strong rally in Antananarivo on 28 February, Rajoelina vowed to continue his struggle "until we end this dictatorship". He said that, beginning on 2 March, protests would be held in the 13 May Plaza on a daily basis; he also called for the army to support him.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-25" /&gt;

A protest in [[Ambositra]] was broken up by police on 4 March, and two people were killed. Also on 4 March, President Ravalomanana declared his intention to "restore order" on [[Radio Mada]]. In Antananarivo, police blocked roads on 5 March to prevent protests in the 13 May Plaza.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-26" /&gt;

The security forces unsuccessfully attempted to arrest Rajoelina at his compound late on 5 March; they also raided his Viva media network. Initially they surrounded Viva, and after 30 minutes the staff attempted to evacuate equipment, at which point the security forces stormed the building and confiscated equipment. Rajoelina told [[Agence France-Presse]] on 7 March that he was "now hiding in a safe location where I cannot be attacked";&lt;ref name="AutoRI-27" /&gt; it was later acknowledged that he had gone to the residence of the French ambassador on 6 March.&lt;ref name="Res" /&gt;

=== Mutiny and military leadership change ===
{{main article|2009 Camp Capsat mutiny}}
Soldiers at a military base in Soanierana district, near Antananarivo, mutinied on 8 March; they objected to the use of force against the opposition.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-28" /&gt; United Nations envoy [[Tiebilé Dramé]] said on 9 March that the UN was placing Rajoelina "under its protection in a diplomatic residence".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-29" /&gt; The French Foreign Ministry said on 10 March that Rajoelina had left the French ambassador's residence.&lt;ref name="Res" /&gt;

On 10 March, the chief of staff of the Malagasy army, General [[Edmond Rasolomahandry]], gave political leaders 72 hours to solve the country's problems and return peace, threatening to take over if this did not occur.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-30" /&gt; The same day, Defence Minister Ranaivoniarivo announced his resignation shortly after a number of army officers visited his office to threaten a switch of allegiances to Rajoelina.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-31" /&gt; On 11 March, pro-opposition soldiers from the CAPSAT (Army Corps of Personnel and Administrative and Technical Services) stormed the army headquarters and forced Edmond Rasolomahandry to resign. Analysts stated that civil war seemed a distinct possibility.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-32" /&gt; Andre Andriarijaona replaced Rasolomahandry, apparently as a result of internal army deliberations and not a presidential appointment, and Andriarijaona said that the military would remain neutral and not seize power, thus revoking the 72-hour ultimatum.&lt;ref name="Lifts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-33" /&gt; A spokesman for Rajoelina said on 11 March that Rajoelina would not participate in talks planned to begin the next day;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-34" /&gt; subsequently the Christian Council of Churches announced that the talks would be delayed.&lt;ref name=Lifts/&gt;

On 12 March, the opposition took over the Ministry of Finance and Budget with the support of the armed forces&lt;ref name="AutoRI-35" /&gt; while the president's prime minister held a ten-minute meeting with the opposition-designated prime minister, who later stated that Rabemananjara had agreed to give up his job to him.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-36" /&gt; The next day, the chief of the military police stated he was taking orders from Andre Andriarijaona and not from the general appointed by Ravalomanana;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-37" /&gt; this was followed by the sending of army tanks against the [[Iavoloha Palace]] of the president, while some 3,000–5,000 civilian supporters of Ravalomanana surrounded the palace to counter opposition protests further away from the area. The Ravalomanana supporters, however, were told to clear the road in case the army neared the area.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-38" /&gt;

On 14 March, Monja occupied the prime minister's office while the opposition forces controlled the building.&lt;ref name="yn-2009-03-15" /&gt; Monja announced that the opposition forces, called the High Authority of Transition, "is presiding over the destiny of Madagascar".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-39" /&gt; Rajoelina gave the president four hours, until 6&amp;nbsp;pm (1500 GMT), to voluntarily resign, after which a mass civilian march would take place on the presidential palace to put Ravalomanana out of office;&lt;ref name=yn-2009-03-15/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-40" /&gt; he explicitly ruled out a violent overthrow through military means. However, Ravalomanana later emerged from the guarded palace after the deadline had passed, asserting that he was still the legal president and calling for a national conference.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-41" /&gt;

On 15 March, Ravalomanana offered to hold a referendum on whether he should stay in power or not, which was seen as a sign of the intense pressure placed on his presidency.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-42" /&gt; The following day, Rajoelina rejected this proposal and called on the security forces to arrest Ravalomanana.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-43" /&gt;

== Capture of palace and Ravalomanana's resignation ==
{{wikinews|Coup in Madagascar; opposition leader backs army}}
On 16 March 2009, one of the palaces of President Ravalomanana, the [[Ambohitsorohitra Palace]], was stormed and taken by soldiers of the Malagasy Army. Reports also indicate the capture of the country's [[central bank]]. The president was not in the stormed palace at the time. The [[African Union]] condemned the action, calling it an "attempted coup d'état". The actions followed an earlier call from opposition leader Andry Rajoelina for the President's arrest;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-44" /&gt; Rajoelina insisted that the palace seizure was not a coup,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; although he immediately installed himself in the presidential offices of the captured palace.

Hours later, the BBC stated that Ravalomanana was to resign and hand over the powers of both the president and prime minister to a military board headed by Vice Admiral [[Hyppolite Ramaroson]].&lt;ref name="AutoRI-45" /&gt; Ravalomanana later said, "I never resigned. I was forced to hand power over, at gun point, on March the 17th."&lt;ref name="so-2009-16-04-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-46" /&gt; At the time, Ravalomanana had already moved out of the Iavoloha Palace to an undisclosed location; as of 24 March, he was reportedly in [[Swaziland]].&lt;ref name="AutoRI-47" /&gt; The military junta, consisting of senior military personnel, would have been charged with organizing elections within 24 months and re-writing the constitution for the "Fourth Republic".&lt;ref name="lough1" /&gt; However, Vice Admiral Ramaroson announced on 18 March that it would transfer power directly to Rajoelina, making him president of the opposition-dominated [[High Transitional Authority (Madagascar)|High Transitional Authority]] that he had appointed weeks earlier.&lt;ref name="bbc-2009-03-18" /&gt; With the military's backing, the authority was charged with taking up the task previously accorded to Ravalomanana's proposed military directorate.&lt;ref name=bbc-2009-03-18/&gt; Madagascar's constitutional court deemed the transfer of power, from Ravalomanana to the military board and then to Rajoelina, to be legal.&lt;ref name="aj-2009-03-19" /&gt; The court's statement did not include any justifications for its decision.&lt;ref name="cbc-2009-03-21" /&gt;

Rajoelina said that Ravalomanana should be prosecuted for allegedly using lethal force against unarmed opposition demonstrators earlier in the year.&lt;ref name=aj-2009-03-19/&gt; Rajoelina is prohibiting Ravalomanana's ministers from leaving the country.&lt;ref name=aj-2009-03-19/&gt;

On 19 March, Rajoelina suspended both chambers of [[Parliament of Madagascar|Parliament]].&lt;ref name=aj-2009-03-19/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-48" /&gt; Roindefo responded to international criticism on 20 March, saying that the government will "explain the real situation. Maybe the way Madagascar acts is not very clear. Things can be a bit specific which may be difficult to follow in every detail."&lt;ref name="AutoRI-49" /&gt; According to Roindefo, the transfer of power was not a coup d'état but instead "the direct expression of democracy, when representative democracy does not express itself through the institutions".&lt;ref name="gn-2009-03-21" /&gt; Rajoelina was sworn in as President on 21 March before a crowd of 40,000 supporters.&lt;ref name=gn-2009-03-21/&gt; No foreign diplomats were in attendance;&lt;ref name=cbc-2009-03-21/&gt; Rajoelina's foreign minister said none were invited.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-50" /&gt;

On the same day, Malagasy navy troops called for Rajoelina's resignation by 25 March, threatening to use force otherwise to protect the constitution of Madagascar.&lt;ref name="pdo-2009-30-25" /&gt; According to their statement, the navy troops "condemn all violence against civilians" committed by the army corps in March and denounce Rajoelina for the "civil war occurring in Madagascar".&lt;ref name=pdo-2009-30-25/&gt; The navy troops claimed that there was "irrefutable" evidence that Rajoelina had paid the army corps hundreds of millions of [[Malagasy ariary|ariaries]] and that they should face trials in accordance with military law.&lt;ref name=pdo-2009-30-25/&gt; The navy troops called for other nations not to get involved in what they considered a purely domestic affair.&lt;ref name=pdo-2009-30-25/&gt;

In a recorded message from Ravalomanana played to around 10,000 of supporters on 25 March, Ravalomanana encouraged people to "save the nation, defend the union and our national unity" because Rajoelina's government was "destroying our country with their coup."&lt;ref name="bbc-25-03-2009" /&gt;

Also on 25 March, Rajoelina invited Ravalomanana's political party to join other political parties, unions, and business leaders to discuss reconciliation on 2 and 3 April.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-51" /&gt; Rajoelina said the meeting would also include planning for the next elections.&lt;ref name="r-26-03-2009" /&gt; Rajoelina said he would appoint the members of the group who would organize the meeting.&lt;ref name="ap-26-03-2009" /&gt; Ravalomanana's political party, [[Tiako I Madagasikara]] (TIM), did not immediately comment on whether it would participate in those meetings.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-52" /&gt;

On 26 March, Rajoelina's justice minister said that Rajoelina had given a presidential [[pardon]] to 28 "[[political prisoner]]s" and that more would be pardoned in the future.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt; Members of TIM spoke to the crowd.&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt; The names of the pardoned individuals were not made public.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt;

About 6,000 people who supported Ravalomanana assembled in a park in downtown Antananarivo on 26 March,&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt; the fourth consecutive of such protests.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt; Members of TIM spoke to the crowd.&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt; Referring to the reconciliation meeting proposed by Rajoelina, the speakers said that Ravalomanana would be involved only if he were recognized at the meeting as Madagascar's elected president and only if the United Nations, Southern African Development Community, or another neutral, international body organized the meeting.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt; The speakers urged Ravalomanana to leave Swaziland, return to Madagascar, and call the bicameral parliament back in session.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-53" /&gt; One speaker said that elections should only be held after Ravalomanana was reinstated as president.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-54" /&gt; Following the speeches, security forces fired tear gas and shot bullets into the air to disperse the crowd.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt;

The following day, about 6,000 people who supported Ravalomanana assembled again, the fifth such demonstration in five consecutive days.&lt;ref name="r-27-03-2009" /&gt; Police used tear gas on the assembled individuals at the end of the event, as they did at the end of the previous day's demonstration.&lt;ref name=r-27-03-2009/&gt;

On 28 March, between 15,000&lt;ref name="bbc-28-03-2009" /&gt; and 20,000&lt;ref name="AutoRI-55" /&gt; protesters assembled for the sixth consecutive day.&lt;ref name="aj-28-03-2009" /&gt; In a recorded message played to the assembled crowd, Ravalomanana encouraged his supporters to continue protesting and gave assurance that he would return to Madagascar soon.&lt;ref name=aj-28-03-2009/&gt; While marching towards the 13 May Plaza, the same location that Rajoelina's supporters had assembled earlier in the year, police fired their weapons into the air&lt;ref name="AutoRI-56" /&gt; and used tear gas&lt;ref name=bbc-28-03-2009/&gt; to disperse the crowds, resulting in a stampede that injured 34 people.&lt;ref name="ap-28-03-2009" /&gt; A young protester named "Razily", who was seen in a video of 28 March protests carrying the Malagasy flag at the head of the protests before being publicly beaten and carted off by police, became a [[cause célèbre]] when the video was distributed online; he has not been seen since his arrest. Police said they were trying to keep Ravalomanana's supporters from confronting Rajoelina's supporters.&lt;ref name=ap-28-03-2009/&gt; In response to the police actions, Ravalomanana's supporters encouraged a general strike on 30 March, saying, "Students should not go to school, office workers should stop their work and the private sector should stop paying taxes so as not to support an illegal regime."&lt;ref name=ap-28-03-2009/&gt; Protests continued nearly every day thereafter.&lt;ref name="bbc-20-04-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21" /&gt;

On 31 March, Rajoelina announced the individuals who would constitute the cabinet of his transitional administration for 24 months until elections are held.&lt;ref name="bbc 2009-03-31" /&gt; Rajoelina compared himself to Ravalomanana, saying that Ravalomanana was not immediately accepted by world leaders when he came to power in 2002.&lt;ref name="bbc 2009-03-31" /&gt; Rajoelina reiterated his previous statements that other countries should not "interfere" with his rise to the presidency of Madagascar.&lt;ref name="bbc 2009-03-31" /&gt; Rajoelina also announced a freeze of all mining contracts with foreign companies, saying that the foreign companies are not paying the fees and royalties that are legally due to Madagascar.&lt;ref name="afp-30-03-2009" /&gt;

Still asserting that he was the legitimate president, Ravalomanana announced from exile that he was appointing [[Manandafy Rakotonirina]] as Prime Minister on 16 April. Ravalomanana made this announcement by telephone at a rally of his supporters in Antananarivo, with Rakotonirina in attendance.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-57" /&gt;

On 20 April, people gathered in Antananarivo to listen to Ravalomanana speak by telephone and protest the closure of two radio stations, Radio Fahazavana and Radio Mada,&lt;ref name=bbc-20-04-2009/&gt; the latter of which is owned by Ravalomanana.&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21"/&gt; When the protesters began marching to a courthouse in the center of the city, police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and then fired their guns.&lt;ref name=bbc-20-04-2009/&gt; A [[BBC]] reporter witnessed a protester killed after being shot in the back at close range.&lt;ref name=bbc-20-04-2009/&gt; Another protester was also killed and twenty people went to the hospital for injuries sustained during the protests.&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21"/&gt; The following day, thousands of people assembled to mourn the two deaths.&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21"/&gt; [[List of heads of government of Madagascar|Prime Minister]] [[Roindefo Monja]] announced that "all demonstrations are banned, including those in support of Andry Rajoelina, in order to restore law and order."&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21"/&gt; Despite the ban, a demonstration was held the following day.&lt;ref name="afp-22-04-2009" /&gt; Over a thousand people assembled to protest, fewer in number and shorter in duration as compared in previous days.&lt;ref name=afp-22-04-2009/&gt;

Cars and trucks were set on fire and people were looting in Antananarivo on 23 April.&lt;ref name="ap-23-04-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-23-04-2009" /&gt; Police used tear gas, detonators, and gun fire to break up protests.&lt;ref name=bbc-23-04-2009/&gt; Six protesters were arrested.&lt;ref name="afp-23-04-2009" /&gt;

After Ravalomanana appointed him as Prime Minister, Rakotonirina began working out of the Carlton hotel in Antananarivo, and he appointed ministers to occupy the key government portfolios on 28 April. Soldiers with a warrant for Rakotonirina's arrest stormed the Carlton and arrested him on 29 April; they found him hiding in a bathroom after searching for about an hour. A spokesperson for Rajoelina described Rakotonirina as "the mastermind of last week's violence".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-58" /&gt; Also in late April, Rajoelina's government informed the AU that it was prepared to hold an election by the end of 2009, earlier than it had previously stated.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-59" /&gt;

=== Reconciliation meeting ===
At a reconciliation meeting that included four former presidents of Madagascar and United Nations negotiators, it was announced on 3 April that a [[Malagasy constitutional referendum, 2009|constitutional referendum]] would be held in September 2009, [[Malagasy parliamentary election, 2010|parliamentary elections]] in March 2010 and [[Malagasy presidential election, 2010|presidential elections]] in October 2010.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-60" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-61" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-62" /&gt;

On 11 April, Ravalomanana's supporters ended their participation in meetings with Rajoelina's supporters.&lt;ref name="bbc-11-04-2009" /&gt; Ravalomanana's supporters saying that the meetings were not worthwhile because their condition of the Ravalomanana's return to power was not met, nor was the United Nations' special envoy to Madagascar, [[Tiébilé Dramé]], acting as an impartial mediator.&lt;ref name="afp-11-04-2009" /&gt; In response, Dramé said he was "seeking a consensus" rather than an "imposed solution".&lt;ref name=afp-11-04-2009/&gt; On the same day, more than 10,000 people assembled in Antananarivo to protest Rajoelina's government.&lt;ref name=bbc-11-04-2009/&gt;

At a meeting on 23 May 2009 a breakthrough was reached; a transitional government and a [[truth and reconciliation commission]] was agreed to be formed, and all former presidents would be allowed to stand in the presidential elections; this last point was seen as controversial, as it might increase instability.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-63" /&gt; However, on 25 May 2009 the party of [[Didier Ratsiraka]] withdrew from the talks.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-64" /&gt;

=== Mediation crisis talks ===
Former exiled president of Madagascar [[Marc Ravalomanana]], [[President of Madagascar|President of the High Authority of Transition of Madagascar]] [[Andry Rajoelina]], former exiled Madagascar president [[Didier Ratsiraka]] and former president of the Malagasy Republic [[Albert Zafy]] met on Tuesday 4 August 2009 in Maputo, Mozambican capital, for four-day-long mediation crisis talks with the former Mozambican President [[Joaquim Chissano]] acting as mediator. Representatives came from the [[African Union]] (AU), United Nations (UN), the [[Francophonie|International Organisation of the Francophonie]] and the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC). The mediation talks hoped to arrive at a way for Ravalomanana to return to Madagascar from his exile in South Africa. The talks were also a trade meeting to begin negotiations on the transition charter to seek new elections in Madagascar. Ratsiraka, who had been exiled in France, saw his amnesty issue resolved at the talks. The four leaders sought to again become a customs union (SADC), and representatives of the United Nations.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-65" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-66" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-67" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-68" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-69" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-70" /&gt;

== Unity government deal ==
On 7 November 2009, the leaders agreed to a power-sharing deal in which Rajoelina stays as president, creation of two co-presidents, [[Fetison Rakoto Andrianirina]], aide to former President Ravalomanana and [[Emmanuel Rakotovahiny]], aide to former President Zafy. Prime Minister [[Eugene Mangalaza]] who was appointed on 10 October will be retained heading the 31-member cabinet. The deal also creates a 65-member council of transitional advisers and a transitional parliament composed of 258 members.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-71" /&gt;

During the transition in the government, people have been illegally hunting and logging in [[Marojejy National Park]] and other conservation areas in Madagascar.&lt;ref name="ng" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; While the new Malagasy government is otherwise preoccupied and some park rangers have left their posts, armed groups are cutting down valuable [[rosewood]] trees.&lt;ref name=ng/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; Laws prohibiting the export of rosewood were repealed in January 2009, so the illegally acquired logs can be sold and exported for profit.&lt;ref name=ng/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; Thousands of local people were involved in cutting a documented 123,000 rosewood logs representing an estimated 45,000 rosewood trees from Marojejy, Masoala and Makira National Parks between January–October 2009, with at least 871 containers already exported to China between March–April 2009 alone from the [[Vohemar]] and [[Toamasina]] ports.&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; Floating the rosewood logs down rivers also requires cutting of 4–5 lighter trees, and several [[rosewood]] species are endangered or occur at low densities below 1–5 trees per hectare.&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; Numerous new access paths are created and some individuals built a 6-kilometer-long road into a remote northern park to transport the logs.&lt;ref name="gm-18-04-2009" /&gt; Some ships land directly on the coast to pick up the logs, rather than at government-controlled ports.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Bribery of customs officials has been reported.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Radio commercials have been aired seeking workers to help in the process.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Extracting resources from these conservation areas is likely to threaten already [[critically endangered]] species such as the [[silky sifaka]] [[lemur]],&lt;ref name=ng/&gt; one of the top 25 most endangered [[primate]]s in the world.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-72" /&gt; A statement jointly released by several [[non-governmental organizations]] criticized the logging and hunting occurring in national parks, illegal mining, and [[slash-and-burn|slash-and-burn farming]] occurring in Madagascar.&lt;ref name="fn-30-03-2009" /&gt; The joint statement said that "These deplorable acts will only further impoverish the country and deprive future generations of the Malagasy people from their unique natural heritage."&lt;ref name=fn-30-03-2009/&gt; The groups who issued the statement were [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Conservation International]], [[Wildlife Conservation Society]], [[Missouri Botanical Garden]], [[Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust]], Institute for the Conservation of Tropical Environment, [[The Peregrine Fund]], ONG Fanamby, [[Madagascar Fauna Group]], L'Homme et l'Environnement, and Plant Resources for Tropical Africa.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-73" /&gt;

=== Contracts ===
In 2009, Rajoelina canceled a contract with South Korean company [[Daewoo]].&lt;ref name="ft-2009-03-19" /&gt; Under the contract, Daewoo would have leased {{convert|1300000|ha|km2}} of land, almost half of Madagascar's arable land,&lt;ref name="AutoRI-74" /&gt; for 99 years to grow corn and palm oil for export to South Korea, a project that might have created as many as 45,000 jobs.&lt;ref name=ft-2009-03-19/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-2009-03-19" /&gt; On 10 April 2009, Madagascar's Minister of Land Reform confirmed that the contract with Daewoo had been canceled because its "approach was wrong", even though "the project by itself wasn't bad and such a project is welcome".&lt;ref name="bb-10-04-2009" /&gt; As of 10 April, Daewoo said it had not been informed of the contract's cancellation&lt;ref name=bb-10-04-2009/&gt; and would proceed with the project regardless.&lt;ref name=ft-2009-03-19/&gt;

On 17 March 2009, Canadian energy company [[Sherritt International]] said its 27-year $4.5-billion nickel-mining project would still begin in 2010 and reach full production in 2013, as scheduled.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-75" /&gt; On 19 March 2009, it said it was likely the project's start date would be delayed.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-76" /&gt;

=== Economic ===
Finance Minister Benja Razafimahaleo reported a decrease in government revenue of 15 to 20 percent.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Ravalomanana owns Tiko, the largest dairy farm in Madagascar.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-77" /&gt; After Rajoelina became president, Rajoelina's supporters looted Tiko dairy farms, resulting in a milk shortage in Madagascar.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Revenue from foreign tourists has decreased by 70 percent, in part because some foreign countries are cautioning their citizens against visiting the country&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; About 70 percent of hotels have closed due to the sharp drop in business.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; One large hotel that has remained open temporarily laid off 150 of its 400 employees and cut the hours and wages of its other 250 employees.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Strikes, wage shortages, and cuts in foreign aid are also causing economic problems for the country.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt;

=== Sports ===
On 28 January 2009, the [[Confederation of African Football]] canceled a match between Madagascar's [[Academie Ny Antsika]] and [[Réunion]]'s [[US Stade Tamponnaise|Union Sportive Stade Tamponnaise]], which was set to be played in Antananarivo.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-78" /&gt;

The African Union suspended Madagascar's membership in the organization. The [[Peace and Security Council]] of the African Union announced that it would impose sanctions on the Madagascar government if an "unconstitutional" transfer of power were to take place, including total expulsion from the African Union.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-95" /&gt; The African Union can enact sanctions if Madagascar does not restore constitutional order within six months.&lt;ref name="tg 2009-03-20" /&gt;

The African Union's stance was corroborated by Czech Foreign Minister [[Karel Schwarzenberg]], who stated that the European Union may impose sanctions on Madagascar and not recognize the transfer of power,&lt;ref name="AutoRI-96" /&gt; and the United States Department of State, which indicated a similar response to any "extra-constitutional" regime change.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-97" /&gt; The Southern African Development Community will meet in late March to consider sanctions.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-98" /&gt;

On 31 March, the [[European Union]] said it had not suspended its aid to Madagascar, which will continue for the next three years as previously agreed, but it also had no plans for new aid.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-99" /&gt;

US President Barack Obama decided to remove Madagascar from the beneficiary of the AGOA [[African Growth and Opportunity Act]]. On 23 December of the year 2009, President Obama also terminated the program for Guinea, Niger and Madagascar because of their undemocratic changes of power.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-100" /&gt; The AGOA program has helped created ten of thousands of jobs for middle class Malagasy especially in apparel manufacturing factories, it is feared that most of these jobs will be lost in the near future. Considering the important number of business affected by this decision, the economy of the capital city Antananarivo and [[Antsirabe]] will be deeply affected fearing further social tension.

=== Government response ===
Most of the government response has been channeled through opposition prime minister [[Monja Roindefo]], who denied that the events leading to Rajoelina's gaining of the presidency was a coup, but rather a "direct expression of democracy, when representative democracy does not express itself through the institutions",&lt;ref name="tg 2009-03-20" /&gt; and called on the European Union to reconsider its reaction to the events. Rajoelina dismissed the condemnations, stating that "if they haven't understood the process, they may well react. But if they stick to their line after we have spoken, it will be annoying".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-101" /&gt;

Rajoelina has promised that the high [[cost of living]] would decrease because merchants had agreed to decrease the price of bread and cooking oil as of 30 March, and the cost of rice soon thereafter.&lt;ref name=ap-28-03-2009/&gt;

In response to the [[Southern African Development Community]]'s view that Rajoelina's rise to power was unconstitutional and its urging for elections within six months, Rajoelina said that membership in the SADC is "not in the interests of Madagascar".&lt;ref name=r-30-03-2009/&gt; He said he would confer with others to decide whether Madagascar would continue to be a member of the SADC.&lt;ref name=r-30-03-2009/&gt; "The prospect of an SADC intervention is unacceptable. Other states cannot interfere with the decision of (Madagascar's) High Constitutional Court" that the transfer of power to Rajoelina was constitutional.&lt;ref name=r-30-03-2009/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4907">'''AVT Statistical filtering algorithm''' is an approach to improving quality of raw data collected from various sources. It is most effective in cases when there is inband noise present. In those cases AVT is better at filtering data then, [[band-pass filter]] or any digital filtering based on variation of.

Conventional filtering is useful when signal/data has different frequency than noise and signal/data is separated/filtered by frequency discrimination of noise. Frequency discrimination filtering is done using Low Pass, High Pass and Band Pass filtering which refers to relative frequency filtering criteria target for such configuration. Those filters are created using passive and active components and sometimes are implemented using software algorithms based on FFT.

AVT filtering is implemented in software and its inner working is based on statistical analysis of raw data.

When signal frequency/(useful data distribution frequency) coincides with noise frequency/(noisy data distribution frequency) we have inband noise. In this situations frequency discrimination filtering does not work since the noise and useful signal are indistinguishable and where AVT excels. To achieve filtering in such conditions there are several methods/algorithms available which are briefly described below.

== Averaging Algorithm ==
#Collect n samples of data
#Calculate average value of collected data
#Present/record result as actual data

== Median Algorithm ==
#Collect n samples of data
#Sort the data in ascending or descending order. Note that order does not matter
#Select the data that happen to be in n/2 position and present/record it as final result representing data sample

== AVT Algorithm ==
[[File:AVT inner working.png|thumb|AVT inner working]]
AVT algorithm stands for Antonyan Vardan Transform and its implementation explained below.
#Collect n samples of data
#Calculate the standard deviation and average value
#Drop any data that is greater or less than average ± one standard deviation  
#Calculate average value of remaining data
#Present/record result as actual value representing data sample

This algorithm is based on amplitude discrimination and can easily reject any noise that is not like actual signal, otherwise statistically different then 1 standard deviation of the signal. Note that this type of filtering can be used in situations where the actual environmental noise is not known in advance.

==Filtering algorithms comparison==
Using a system that has signal value of 1 and has noise added at 0.1% and 1% levels will simplify quantification of algorithm performance. The R&lt;ref name="r-project"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.r-project.org/ |title=The R Project for Statistical Computing |publisher=r-project.org|accessdate=2015-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; script is used to create pseudo random noise added to signal and analyze the results of filtering using several algorithms. Please refer to "Reduce Inband Noise with the AVT Algorithm" &lt;ref name="electronicdesign"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electronicdesign.com/embedded/reduce-inband-noise-avt-algorithm |title=Reduce Inband Noise with the AVT Algorithm &amp;#124; Embedded content from Electronic Design |publisher=electronicdesign.com|accessdate=2015-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; article for details.
This graphs show that AVT algorithm provides best results compared with Median and Averaging algorithms while using data sample size of 32, 64 and 128 values. Note that this graph was created by analyzing random data array of 10000 values. Sample of this data is graphically represented below.&lt;br/&gt;
[[File:AVT comparasion error data.png|AVT algorithm comparison]]
[[File:AVT test data sample.png|AVT test data sample]]

==AVT algorithm variations==

===Cascaded AVT===
In some situations better results can be obtained by cascading several stages of AVT filtering. This will produce singular constant value which can be used for equipment that has known stable characteristics like thermometers, thermistors and other slow acting sensors.

===Reverse AVT===
#Collect n samples of data
#Calculate the standard deviation and average value
#Drop any data that is within one standard deviation ± average band
#Calculate average value of remaining data
#Present/record result as actual data
This is useful for detecting minute signals that are close to background noise level.

==Possible applications and uses==
*Used in planet detection to filter out raw data from [[Kepler (spacecraft)]]
*Filter out noise from sound sources where all other filtering methods ([[Low-pass filter]], [[High-pass filter]], [[Band-pass filter]], [[Digital filter]]) fail.
*Preprocess scientific data for data analysis ([[Smoothness]]) before plotting see ([[Plot (graphics)]])
*Used in SETI ([[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence]]) for detecting/distinguishing extraterrestrial signals from cosmic background

{{Classic element}}

'''''Ap''''' (''{{IAST|áp-}}'') is the [[Vedic Sanskrit]] term for "water", which in [[Classical Sanskrit]] only occurs in the plural, ''''[[Varuna]]'''' or '''''{{IAST|āpas}}''''' (sometimes re-analysed as a thematic singular, ''{{IAST|āpa-}}''), whence [[Hindi]] '''''{{IAST|āp}}'''''. The term is from [[PIE]] {{PIE|''h&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;ap''}} "water".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The word has many cognates in archaic European toponyms, e.g., ''[[Messapia (disambiguation)|Mess-apia]]'', and perhaps also ''[[River Avon (disambiguation)|Avon]]'', from [[British language (Celtic)|Old Brythonic]] ''abona'' or Welsh ''[[afon]]'' ({{IPA-cy|ˈavɔn|pron}}), both meaning 'river'.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] word also survives as the [[Persian language|Persian]] word for water, ''āb'',  e.g. in ''[[Punjab region|Punjab]]'' (from ''panj-āb'' "five waters"). In archaic [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]]ing contractions, the [[Laryngeal theory|laryngeal]] of the PIE root remains visible in Vedic Sanskrit, e.g. ''{{IAST|pratīpa-}}'' "against the current", from ''*{{PIE|proti-h&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;p-o-}}''. In [[Tamil language|Tamil]], Ap means water, and has references in poetry.

In the [[Rigveda]], several hymns are dedicated to "the waters" (''{{IAST|āpas}}''): 7.49, 10.9, 10.30, 10.47. In the oldest of these, 7.49, the waters are connected with the drought of [[Indra]].  [[Agni]], the god of fire, has a close association with water and is often referred to as ''[[Apam Napat|Apām Napāt]]'' "offspring of the waters". In Vedic astrology, the female deity Apah is the presiding deity of the [[Purva Ashadha]] [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]], meaning "first of the aṣāḍhā", with aṣāḍhā "the invincible one" being the name of the  greater constellation.

In [[Hindu philosophy]], the term refers to  [[water (classical element)|water as an element]], one of the ''[[Mahābhūta|Panchamahabhuta]],'' or "five great elements". In [[Hinduism]], it is also the name of the deva Varuna a [[personification]] of water, one of the [[Vasu]]s in most later [[Puranic]] lists.

'''Aversion therapy''' is a form of [[psychological]] treatment in which the patient is exposed to a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] while simultaneously being subjected to some form of discomfort. This [[classical conditioning|conditioning]] is intended to cause the patient to associate the [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] with unpleasant sensations with the intention of quelling the targeted (sometimes compulsive) behavior.

Aversion therapies can take many forms, for example: placing unpleasant-tasting substances on the [[fingernail]]s to discourage [[nail-chewing]]; pairing the use of an [[Vomiting#Emetics|emetic]] with the experience of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]; or pairing behavior with [[electric shock]]s of mild to higher intensities.

==In addictions==
The major use of aversion therapy is for the treatment of addiction to alcohol and other drugs. This form of treatment has been applied since 1932. The treatment is discussed in the ''Principles of Addiction Medicine'', Chapter 8, published by the [[American Society of Addiction Medicine]] in 2003.

===Alcohol addiction===
[[Disulfiram]] is used to treat [[alcohol dependence]]; it causes negative effects when a person drinks alcohol while the drug is in their system.  It has been described as an aversion therapy, but it appears that it has more of a deterrent effect, since people who take it generally don't drink and therefore don't experience the negative effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brewer |first1=C |last2=Streel |first2=E |last3=Skinner |first3=M |title=Supervised Disulfiram's Superior Effectiveness in Alcoholism Treatment: Ethical, Methodological, and Psychological Aspects. |journal=Alcohol and alcoholism (Oxford, Oxfordshire) |date=9 March 2017 |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=213-219 |doi=10.1093/alcalc/agw093 |pmid=28064151}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fralwey |first1=P. Joseph |last2=Howard |first2=Matthew O. |chapter=Aversion Therapies |editor1-last=Ries |editor1-first=Richard K. |editor2-last=Fiellin |editor2-first=David A. |editor3-last=Miller |editor3-first=Shannon C. |editor4-last=Saitz |editor4-first=Richard |title=Principles of Addiction Medicine |date=2009 |publisher=Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-7817-7477-2 |pages=843–844 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cigarette addiction===
Specifically, electrical aversion techniques have been demonstrated to significantly improve success rates among [[cigarettes|cigarette smokers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Russell |first=M. A. Hamilton |date=January 1970 |title=Effect Of Electric Aversion On Cigarette Smoking |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=1 |issue=5688 |pages=82–86 |jstor=20379143 |pmc=1699162 |pmid=5411450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional longitudinal studies have repeated this effect, and showed cessation periods lasting at least 15 months post-trial. The examined trial involved 5 days of aversion therapy using an electric stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J. Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment, Vol. 5. pp. 33-36, 1988.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cocaine dependency===
Emetic therapy and faradic aversion therapy is used to induce aversion for cocaine dependency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerome J. Platt|title=Cocaine Addiction: Theory, Research, and Treatment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5tZqyz2i-cwC&amp;pg=PA241|year=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-00178-7|pages=241–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In compulsive habits==
Many individuals struggle with subconscious or compulsive habits, such as chronic [[nailbiting]], hair-pulling ([[Trichotillomania]]), or skin-picking (commonly associated with forms of [[Obsessive Compulsive Disorder]] as well as [[Trichotillomania]]). The effects of these habits are compounded by a lack of awareness, as the individual often does not make the conscious decision to engage in the particular behavior, in contrast to disorders of drug or alcohol addiction.

===Nail biting===
A relevant study of chronic nail-biters examined effects of electric stimulus, bitter substance (as applied to the nails), and placebo in biting reduction. Associating nail-biting with an electric stimulus or bitter substance showed similar levels of habit reduction as a result of aversion therapy, with over 80% of subjects exhibiting significant cessation rates up to 3 months post-trial.&lt;ref&gt;Vargas, John M., and Vincent J. Adesso. ‘A Comparison Of Aversion Therapies For Nailbiting Behavior’. Behavior Therapy 7.3. 322-329. (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; A similar study on the [[UCLA]] campus, examining electric stimulus conditioning on nail-biting alone, shared similar rapid and lasting results, with almost half of subjects ceasing entirely on the first day of treatment, and the majority having quit within 5 days.&lt;ref&gt;Bucher, Bradley D. ‘A Pocket-Portable Shock Device With Application To Nailbiting’. Behaviour Research and Therapy 6.3 (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trichotillomania===
More research is needed in cases of [[Trichotillomania]] (obsessive hair-pulling), but preliminary case-based data have demonstrated promising results for aversion therapy, specifically that of electric aversion.&lt;ref&gt;BAR, LOUIS H. J., and BEN R. M. KUYPERS. ‘Behaviour Therapy In Dermatological Practice’.Br J Dermatol 88.6 (1973): 591-598.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aversion Therapy in the Treatment of Trichotillomania: A Case Study__Crawford, David A. ‘Aversion Therapy In The Treatment Of Trichotillomania: A Case Study’. Behav. Psychother. 16.01 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, J T, R G Miltenberger, and E S Long. ‘Augmenting Simplified Habit Reversal With An Awareness Enhancement Device: Preliminary Findings.’. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis 31.4 (1998): 665-668.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obsessive compulsive disorder===
As well, in cases specific to the rituals of [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], using an electric stimulus to pair an unpleasant association with the undesired behavior has been successful in individual studies.&lt;ref&gt;‘The Elimination Of Chronic Cough By Response Suppression Shaping’. Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry 4.1 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Le Boeuf, Alan. ‘An Automated Aversion Device In The Treatment Of A Compulsive Handwashing Ritual’. Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry 5.3-4 (1974): 267-270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, F.T., L. Solyom, and C. Solyom. ‘Faradic Disruption Of Obsessive Ideation In The Treatment Of Obsessive Neurosis’. Behavior Therapy 4.3 (1973): 448-457.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Behaviour therapy''' is a broad term referring to clinical [[psychotherapy]] that uses techniques derived from [[behaviourism]]. Those who practice behaviour therapy tend to look at specific, learned behaviours and how the environment influences those behaviours. Those who practice behaviour therapy are called behaviourists, or [[licensed behavior analyst|behaviour analysts]].&lt;ref name="O'Leary, K. Daniel 1975"&gt;O'Leary, K. Daniel, and G. Terence Wilson. Behaviour Therapy: Application and Outcome, 7-12. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1975. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to look for treatment outcomes that are objectively measurable.&lt;ref&gt;O'Leary, K. Daniel, and G. Terence Wilson. Behaviour Therapy: Application and Outcome, 12-14. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1975. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviour therapy does not involve one specific method but it has a wide range of techniques that can be used to treat a person's psychological problems.&lt;ref name="Antony, M.M. 2003 pp. 182-223"&gt;Antony, M.M., &amp; Roemer, E. (2003). Behaviour therapy. In A.S. Gurman &amp; S.B. Messer (Eds.), Essential psychotherapies (2nd ed., pp. 182-223). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Applied behaviour analysis]] (ABA) is the application of behaviour analysis that focuses on assessing how environmental variables influence learning principles, particularly [[respondent conditioning|respondent]] and [[operant conditioning]], to identify potential behaviour-change procedures, which are frequently used throughout [[Clinical behavior analysis|clinical therapy]]. [[Cognitive behavioural therapy|Cognitive-behavior therapy]] views cognition and emotions as preceding overt behavior with treatment plans in psychotherapy to lessen the issue. Hallmark techniques of behaviour therapies are overlapping components of [[cognitive psychology]], in addition to behaviour analytic principles of [[counterconditioning]], [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]], [[habituation]], and [[Functional analysis (psychology)|functional analysis]] (FA).

Methodological behaviourism, which does not acknowledge that behaviour can also be covert, is not entirely outdated in clinical practice. [[Exposure and response prevention]] (ERP), a subcategory of "[[Flooding (psychology)|Flooding]]" [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]] and derived from methodological behaviourism, for example, is typically used for clients with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD). Although not entirely behaviour analytic in theory, the behaviour therapist will first use functional behaviour assessments (FBAs) and behaviour intervention plans (BIPs) before implementing the intervention, and does rely on functional analysis in that respect.

==History==
{{see also|Behavior modification}}
Precursors of certain fundamental aspects of behaviour therapy have been identified in various ancient philosophical traditions, particularly [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref name="RobertsonUS952010"&gt;{{Cite book |author= Robertson, D. |title=The Philosophy of Cognitive–Behavioural Therapy: Stoicism as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy |year=2010 |publisher=Karnac |location=London |isbn=978-1-85575-756-1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XsOFyJaR5vEC&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Joseph Wolpe|Wolpe]] and [[Arnold Lazarus|Lazarus]] wrote,
{{quote|While the modern behavior therapist deliberately applies principles of learning to this therapeutic operations, empirical behavior therapy is probably as old as civilization&amp;nbsp;– if we consider civilization as having started when man first did things to further the well-being of other men. From the time that this became a feature of human life there must have been occasions when a man complained of his ills to another who advised or persuaded him of a course of action. In a broad sense, this could be called behavior therapy whenever the behavior itself was conceived as the therapeutic agent. Ancient writings contain innumerable behavioral prescriptions that accord with this broad conception of behavior therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpe, J. &amp; Lazarus, A. (1966) ''Behavior Therapy Techniques: A Guide to the Treatment of Neuroses'', pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first use of the term behaviour modification appears to have been by [[Edward Thorndike]] in 1911. His article ''Provisional Laws of Acquired Behavior or Learning'' makes frequent use of the term "modifying behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Thorndike |first=E.L. |year=1911 |title=Provisional Laws of Acquired Behavior or Learning |journal=Animal Intelligence |publisher=The McMillian Company |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through early research in the 1940s and the 1950s the term was used by [[Joseph Wolpe]]'s research group.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpe (1958) ''Psychotherapy by Reciprocal Inhibition''&lt;/ref&gt; The experimental tradition in clinical psychology&lt;ref&gt;In A.J. Bachrach (Ed.), Experimental foundations of clinical psychology (pp. 3–25). New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt; used it to refer to psycho-therapeutic techniques derived from empirical research. It has since come to refer mainly to techniques for increasing adaptive behaviour through reinforcement and decreasing maladaptive behaviour through extinction or punishment (with emphasis on the former). Two related terms are behaviour therapy and [[applied behaviour analysis]]. Since techniques derived from behavioural psychology tend to be the most effective in altering behaviour, most practitioners consider behaviour modification along with behaviour therapy and applied behaviour analysis to be founded in [[behaviourism]]. While behaviour modification and applied behaviour analysis typically uses interventions based on the same behavioural principles, many behaviour modifiers who are not applied behaviour analysts tend to use packages of interventions and do not conduct functional assessments before intervening.

Possibly the first occurrence of the term "behavior therapy" was in a 1953 research project by [[B.F. Skinner]], [[Ogden Lindsley]], Nathan H. Azrin and [[Harry C. Solomon]].&lt;ref name="lindsley et al."&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lindsley, O. |author2=Skinner, B.F. |author3=Solomon, H.C. |title=Studies in behavior therapy (Status Report I) |publisher=Walthama, MA.: Metropolitan State Hospital |year=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper talked about operant conditioning and how it could be used to help improve the functioning of people who were diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia. Early pioneers in behaviour therapy include [[Joseph Wolpe]] and [[Hans Eysenck]].&lt;ref name="clarkUS95fairburn"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=David M. |author2=Christopher G. Fairburn |authorlink=David Clark (psychiatrist) |title=Science and Practice of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1997 |isbn=0-19-262726-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, behaviour therapy is seen as having three distinct points of origin: South Africa (Wolpe's group), The United States (Skinner), and the United Kingdom (Rachman and Eysenck). Each had its own distinct approach to viewing behaviour problems. Eysenck in particular viewed behaviour problems as an interplay between personality characteristics, environment, and behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, A.J.(1970). Behavior Therapy. New York Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner's group in the United States took more of an [[operant conditioning]] focus. The operant focus created a functional approach to assessment and interventions focused on [[contingency management]] such as the [[token economy]] and [[behavioural activation]]. Skinner's student [[Ogden Lindsley]] is credited with forming a movement called [[precision teaching]], which developed a particular type of graphing program called the standard celeration chart to monitor the progress of clients. Skinner became interested in the individualising of programs for improved learning in those with or without disabilities and worked with [[Fred S. Keller]] to develop [[programmed instruction]]. Programmed instruction had some clinical success in aphasia rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;Goldfarb, R. (2006). Operant Conditioning and Programmed Instruction in Aphasia Rehabilitation. ''SLP-ABA'', 1(1), 56–65 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald Patterson used programme instruction to develop his parenting text for children with conduct problems.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, G.R. (1969). ''Families: A social learning approach to family life''.&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Parent management training]].) With age, [[respondent conditioning]] appears to slow but [[operant conditioning]] remains relatively stable.&lt;ref&gt;Perlmutter, M. &amp; Hall, E. (1985). ''Adult development and aging''. New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; While the concept had its share of advocates and critics in the west, its introduction in the Asian setting, particularly in India in the early 1970s&lt;ref name="Introduction of Behavioural Therapy in Asia" references group="References"&gt;{{cite book|last=Michael.J.Stevens|first=Danny Vedding|title=Handbook of International Psychology|year=2004|publisher=Francis &amp; Taylor|isbn=978-0-415-94612-4|page=227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_MS5H76EVyAC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and its grand success were testament to the famous Indian psychologist [[H. Narayan Murthy]]'s enduring commitment to the principles of behavioural therapy and biofeedback.

While many behaviour therapists remain staunchly committed to the basic [[operant]] and respondent paradigm, in the second half of the 20th century, many therapists coupled behaviour therapy with the [[cognitive therapy]], of [[Aaron Beck]] and [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]], to form [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behaviour therapy]]. In some areas the cognitive component had an additive effect (for example, evidence suggests that cognitive interventions improve the result of social phobia treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.74.3.568 |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=568–78 |last=Clark |first=David M. |title=Cognitive therapy versus exposure and applied relaxation in social phobia: A randomized controlled trial |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |date = June 2006|pmid=16822113 |last2=Ehlers |first2=A. |last3=Hackmann |first3=A. |last4=McManus |first4=F. |last5=Fennell |first5=M. |last6=Grey |first6=N. |last7=Waddington |first7=L. |last8=Wild |first8=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) but in other areas it did not enhance the treatment, which led to the pursuit of third generation behaviour therapies. Third generation behaviour therapy uses basic principles of operant and respondent psychology but couples them with functional analysis and a [[clinical formulation]]/case conceptualisation of verbal behaviour more inline with view of the behaviour analysts. Some research supports these therapies as being more effective in some cases than cognitive therapy,&lt;ref&gt;Block, J.A. &amp; Wulfert, E. (2000) Acceptance or Change: Treating Socially Anxious College Students with ACT or CBGT. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 1(2), 3–10. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; but overall the question is still in need of answers.&lt;ref&gt;Öst, L.G. (2008). "Efficacy of the third wave of behavioral therapies: a systematic review and meta-analysis". ''Behaviour Research and Therapy'', 46(3), 296–321&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific basis==
The behavioural approach to therapy assumes that behaviour that is associated with psychological problems develops through the same processes of learning that affects the development of other behaviours. Therefore, behaviourists see personality problems in the way that personality was developed. They do not look at behaviour disorders as something a person has but that it reflects how learning has influenced certain people to behave in a certain way in certain situations.&lt;ref name="O'Leary, K. Daniel 1975"/&gt;

Behaviour therapy is based upon the principles of [[classical conditioning]] developed by [[Ivan Pavlov]] and [[operant conditioning]] developed by [[B.F. Skinner]]. Classical conditioning happens when a neutral stimulus comes right before another stimulus that triggers a reflexive response. The idea is that if the neutral stimulus and whatever other stimulus that triggers a response is paired together often enough that the neutral stimulus will produce the reflexive response.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, Halmuth H., and Patrick L. Martin. Behavioral Therapy, 20. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Operant conditioning has to do with rewards and punishments and how they can either strengthen or weaken certain behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, Halmuth H., and Patrick L. Martin. Behavioral Therapy, 20-24. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Contingency management]] programs are a direct product of research from [[operant conditioning]]. These programs have been highly successful with those suffering from panic disorders, anxiety disorders, and phobias.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, G.L. &amp; Lentz, R.J. (1977). Psychosocial treatment of chronic mental patients: Milieu versus social learning programs. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Systematic desensitisation]] and [[exposure and response prevention]] both evolved from [[respondent conditioning]] and have also received considerable research.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Behavior avoidance test (BAT) is a behavioural procedure in which the therapist measures how long the client can tolerate an anxiety-inducing stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;Grecory, R. J. (2007). Psychological Testing: history, principles and application. Pearson Education. p.613.&lt;/ref&gt; The BAT falls under the exposure-based methods of behaviour therapy.  Exposure-based methods of behavioural therapy are well suited to the treatment of phobias,{{mcn|date=September 2018}} which include intense and unreasonable fears (e.g., of spiders, blood, public speaking).  The therapist needs some type of behavioural assessment to record the continuing progress of a client undergoing an exposure-based treatment for phobia.  One simple assessment approach for this is the BAT. The BAT approach is predicted on the assumption that the client's fear is the main determinant of behaviour in the testing situation. BAT can be conducted visual, virtually, or physically, depending on the clients' maladaptive behaviour.  Its application is not limited to phobias, it is applied to various disorders such as [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD).&lt;ref&gt;Grecory, R. J. (2007). Psychological Testing: history, principles and application. Pearson Education. pp.421-422&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment===
Behaviour therapists complete a functional analysis or a functional assessment that looks at four important areas: stimulus, organism, response and consequences.&lt;ref name="Nelson, R.O. 1986 pp. 3-41"&gt;Nelson, R.O., &amp; Hayes, S.C. (1986). The nature of behavioural assessment. In R.O. Nelson &amp; S.C. Hayes (Eds.) Conceptual foundations of behavioural assessment (pp. 3-41). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; The stimulus is the condition or environmental trigger that causes behaviour.&lt;ref name="Wolpe, Joseph pp 13"&gt;Wolpe, Joseph. The Practice of Behavior Therapy. pp 13. 3rd ed. New York: Pergamon, 1982. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; An organism involves the internal responses of a person, like physiological responses, emotions and cognition.&lt;ref name="Nelson, R.O. 1986 pp. 3-41"/&gt; A response is the behaviour that a person exhibits and the consequences are the result of the behaviour. These four things are incorporated into an assessment done by the behaviour therapist.&lt;ref name="Wolpe, Joseph pp 13"/&gt;

Most behaviour therapists use objective assessment methods like structured interviews, objective psychological tests or different behavioural rating forms. These types of assessments are used so that the behaviour therapist can determine exactly what a client's problem may be and establish a baseline for any maladaptive responses that the client may have. By having this baseline, as therapy continues this same measure can be used to check a client's progress, which can help determine if the therapy is working. Behaviour therapists do not typically ask the why questions but tend to be more focused on the how, when, where and what questions. Tests such as the Rorschach inkblot test or personality tests like the MMPI ([[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]]) are not commonly used for behavioural assessment because they are based on personality trait theory assuming that a person's answer to these methods can predict behaviour. Behaviour assessment is more focused on the observations of a persons behaviour in their natural environment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;O'Leary, K. Daniel, and G. Terence Wilson. Behaviour Therapy: Application and Outcome, 24-25. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1975. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioural assessment specifically attempts to find out what the environmental and self-imposed variables are.  These variables are the things that are allowing a person to maintain their maladaptive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. In a behavioural assessment "person variables" are also considered. These "person variables" come from a person's social learning history and they effect the way in which the environment affects that person's behaviour. An example of a person variable would be behavioural competence. Behavioural competence looks at whether a person has the appropriate skills and behaviours that are necessary when performing a specific response to a certain situation or stimuli.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

When making a behavioural assessment the behaviour therapist wants to answer two questions: (1) what are the different factors (environmental or psychological) that are maintaining the maladaptive behaviour and (2) what type of behaviour therapy or technique that can help the individual improve most effectively. The first question involves looking at all aspects of a person, which can be summed up by the acronym BASIC ID. This acronym stands for behaviour, affective responses, sensory reactions, imagery, cognitive processes, interpersonal relationships and drug use.&lt;ref&gt;O'Leary, K. Daniel, and G. Terence Wilson. Behavior Therapy: Application and Outcome, pp, 19. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1975. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional analysis has even been applied to problems that therapists commonly encounter like client resistance, partially engaged clients and involuntary clients.&lt;ref&gt;Cautilli, J.; Tillman, T.C.; Axelrod, S.; Dziewolska, H. &amp; Hineline, P. (2006). Resistance Is Not Futile: An experimental analogue of the effects of consultee "resistance" on the consultant's therapeutic behavior in the consultation process: A replication and extension. ''IJBCT'', 2(3), 362–76. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cautilli, J.D.; Riley-Tillman, T.C.; Axelrod, S. &amp; Hineline, P. (2005). Current Behavioral Models of Client and Consultee Resistance: A Critical Review. ''IJBCT'', 1(2), 147–64 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Applications to these problems have left clinicians with considerable tools for enhancing therapeutic effectiveness. One way to enhance therapeutic effectiveness is to use positive reinforcement or operant conditioning. Although behaviour therapy is based on the general learning model, it can be applied in a lot of different treatment packages that can be specifically developed to deal with problematic behaviours. Some of the more well known types of treatments are: Relaxation training, systematic desensitization, virtual reality exposure, exposure and response prevention techniques, social skills training, modeling, behavioural rehearsal and [[Homework in psychotherapy|homework]], and [[aversion therapy]] and punishment.&lt;ref name="Antony, M.M. 2003 pp. 182-223"/&gt;

Relaxation training involves clients learning to lower arousal to reduce their stress by tensing and releasing certain muscle groups throughout their body.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, D.A.,  Borkovec, T.D., &amp; Hazlette-Stevens, H. (2000). Progressive relaxation training: A manual for the helping professions (2nd ed.). New York: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic desensitization is a treatment in which the client slowly substitutes a new learned response for a maladaptive response by moving up a [[Exposure hierarchy|hierarchy]] of situations involving fear.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpe, J. (1958). Psychotherapy by reciprocal inhibition. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic desensitization is based in part on counter conditioning. Counter conditioning is learning new ways to change one response for another and in the case of desensitization it is substituting that maladaptive behaviour for a more relaxing behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Rimm, David C., and John C. Masters. Behavior Therapy: Techniques and Empirical Findings, pp. 43. New York: Academic, 1974. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure and response prevention techniques is also known as flooding and response prevention.&lt;ref name="Rimm, David C. pp. 348"&gt;Rimm, David C., and John C. Masters. Behavior Therapy: Techniques and Empirical Findings, pp. 348. New York: Academic, 1974. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Flooding and response prevention is the general technique in which you expose an individual to anxiety-provoking stimuli while keeping them from having any avoidance responses or keeping them from freaking out.&lt;ref name="Rimm, David C. pp. 348"/&gt;

Virtual reality therapy provides realistic, computer-based simulations of troublesome situations. The modeling process involves a person being subjected to watching other individuals who demonstrate behaviour that is considered adaptive and that should be adopted by the client. This exposure involves not only the cues of the "model person" as well as the situations of a certain behaviour that way the relationship can be seen between the appropriateness of a certain behaviour and situation in which that behaviour occurs is demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;Rimm, David C., and John C. Masters. Behavior Therapy: Techniques and Empirical Findings, 125-126. New York: Academic, 1974. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; With the behavioural rehearsal and homework treatment a client gets a desired behaviour during a therapy session and then they practice and record that behaviour between their sessions. [[Aversion therapy]] and punishment is a technique in which an aversive (painful or unpleasant) stimulus is used to decrease unwanted behaviours from occurring. It is concerned with two procedures: 1) the procedures are used to decrease the likelihood of the frequency of a certain behaviour and 2) procedures that will reduce the attractiveness of certain behaviours and the stimuli that elicit them.&lt;ref&gt;Rimm, David C., and John C. Masters. Behavior Therapy: Techniques and Empirical Findings, pp. 353. New York: Academic, 1974. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment side of aversion therapy is when an aversive stimulus is presented at the same time that a negative stimulus and then they are stopped at the same time when a positive stimulus or response is presented.&lt;ref&gt;Bellack, Alan S., and Michel Hersen. Dictionary of Behavior Therapy Techniques, pp. 14. New York: Pergamon, 1985. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the type of negative stimulus or punishment that can be used is shock therapy treatments,&lt;ref&gt;Rimm, David C., and John C. Masters. Behavior Therapy: Techniques and Empirical Findings, pp. 374. New York: Academic, 1974. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; aversive drug treatments &lt;ref&gt;Rimm, David C., and John C. Masters. Behavior Therapy: Techniques and Empirical Findings, pp. 390. New York: Academic, 1974. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as response cost contingent punishment which involves taking away a reward.

Applied behaviour analysis is using behavioural methods to modify certain behaviours that are seen as being important socially or personally. There are four main characteristics of applied behaviour analysis. First behaviour analysis is focused mainly on overt behaviours in an applied setting. Treatments are developed as a way to alter the relationship between those overt behaviours and their consequences.&lt;ref name="Agras, W. Stewart 1979"&gt;Agras, W. Stewart., Alan E. Kazdin, and G. Terence Wilson. Behavior Therapy: Toward an Applied Clinical Science. San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1979. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another characteristic of applied behaviour analysis is how it(behaviour analysis) goes about evaluating treatment effects. The individual subject is where the focus of study is on, the investigation is centered on the one individual being treated. A third characteristic is that it focuses on what the environment does to cause significant behaviour changes. Finally the last characteristic of applied behaviour analysis is the use of those techniques that stem from operant and classical conditioning such as providing reinforcement, punishment, stimulus control and any other learning principles that may apply.&lt;ref name="Agras, W. Stewart 1979"/&gt;

[[Social skills training]] teaches clients skills to access reinforcers and lessen life punishment. [[Operant conditioning]] procedures in [[meta-analysis]] had the largest effect size for training social skills, followed by [[modelling (psychology)|modelling]], coaching, and social cognitive techniques in that order.&lt;ref&gt;Schnieder, B.H. &amp; Bryne, B.M. (1985). Children's social skills training: A meta-analysis. In B.H. Schneider, K. Rubin, &amp; J.E. Ledingham (Eds.) ''Children's Peer relations: Issues in assessment and intervention'' (pp. 175–90). New York: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Social skills training has some empirical support particularly for schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;Corrigan, P.W. (1997). Behavior therapy empowers persons with severe mental illness. ''Behavior Modification'', 21, 45–61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corrigan, P.W. &amp; Holmes, E.P. (1994). Patient identification of "street skills" for a psychosocial training module. ''Hospital and Community Psychiatry'', 45, 273–6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, with schizophrenia, behavioural programs have generally lost favor.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, S.E. (2006). Behavior Analysis of Psychotic Disorders: Scientific Dead End or Casualty of the Mental Health Political Economy? ''Behavior and Social Issues'', 15(2), 152–77 [http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/bsi/article/view/365]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other techniques that have been used in behaviour therapy are contingency contracting, response costs, token economies, biofeedback, and using shaping and grading task assignments.&lt;ref name="Kramer, Geoffrey P. 2009"&gt;Kramer, Geoffrey P., Douglas A. Bernstein, and Vicky Phares. "Behavioral and Cognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapies." Introduction to Clinical Psychology. 7th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2009. 269-300.

Shaping and graded task assignments are used when behaviour that needs to be learned is complex. The complex behaviours that need to be learned are broken down into simpler steps where the person can achieve small things gradually building up to the more complex behaviour. Each step approximates the eventual goal and helps the person to expand their activities in a gradual way. This behaviour is used when a person feels that something in their lives can not be changed and life's tasks appear to be overwhelming.&lt;ref name="Freeman, Arthur 1989. Pg. 341"&gt;Freeman, Arthur. "Treatment of Suicidal Behavior." Comprehensive Handbook of Cognitive Therapy. New York: Plenum, 1989. Pg. 341. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another technique of behaviour therapy involves holding a client or patient accountable of their behaviours in an effort to change them.  This is called a contingency contract, which is a formal written contract between two or more people that defines the specific expected behaviours that you wish to change and the rewards and punishments that go along with that behaviour.&lt;ref name="Kramer, Geoffrey P. 2009"/&gt; In order for a contingency contract to be official it needs to have five elements. First it must state what each person will get if they successfully complete the desired behaviour. Secondly those people involved have to monitor the behaviours. Third, if the desired behaviour is not being performed in the way that was agreed upon in the contract the punishments that were defined in the contract must be done. Fourth if the persons involved are complying with the contract they must receive bonuses. The last element involves documenting the compliance and noncompliance while using this treatment in order to give the persons involved consistent feedback about the target behaviour and the provision of reinforcers.&lt;ref name="Stuart, Richard B. 1972"&gt;Stuart, Richard B., and Leroy A. Lott, Jr. "Behavior Contracting with Delinquents." Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry 3 (1972): 161-69. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

Token economies is a behaviour therapy technique where clients are reinforced with tokens that are considered a type of currency that can be used to purchase desired rewards, like being able to watch television or getting a snack that they want when they perform designated behaviours.&lt;ref name="Kramer, Geoffrey P. 2009"/&gt; Token economies are mainly used in institutional and therapeutic settings. In order for a token economy to be effective their must be consistency in administering the program by the entire staff. Procedures must be clearly defined so that there is no confusion among the clients. Instead of looking for ways to punish the patients or to deny them of rewards, the staff has to reinforce the positive behaviours so that the clients will increase the occurrence of the desired behaviour. Over time the tokens need to be replaced with less tangible rewards such as compliments so that the client will be prepared when they leave the institution and won't expect to get something every time they perform a desired behaviour.&lt;ref name="Boyle, Scott W 2006"&gt;Boyle, Scott W. "Knowledge and Skills for Intervention." Direct Practice in Social Work. Boston: Pearson/Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2006. 223-225. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Closely related to token economies is a technique called response costs. This technique can either be used with or without token economies. Response costs is the punishment side of token economies where there is a loss of a reward or privilege after someone performs an undesirable behaviour.&lt;ref name="Boyle, Scott W 2006"/&gt; Like token economies this technique is used mainly in institutional and therapeutic settings.&lt;ref name="Kramer, Geoffrey P. 2009"/&gt;

Considerable policy implications have been inspired by behavioural views of various forms of psychopathology. One form of behaviour therapy, [[habit reversal training]], has been found to be highly effective for treating tics.

===Third generation===
The third-generation behaviour therapy movement has been called [[clinical behavior analysis]] because it represents a movement away from cognitivism and back toward [[radical behaviourism]] and other forms of [[behaviourism]], in particular functional analysis and behavioural models of [[verbal behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |volume=3 |pages=248–53 |last=Kohlenberg |first=R.J. |author2=Bolling, M.Y. |author3=Kanter, J.W. |author4=Parker, C.R. |title=Clinical behavior analysis: Where it went wrong, how it was made good again, and why its future is so bright |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |year=2002 |issn=1539-4352 |url=https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/jkanter/www/pdf/publication/behavioranalysis.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1037/h0099988 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008194237/https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/jkanter/www/pdf/publication/behavioranalysis.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This area includes [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT), cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP) (McCullough, 2000), [[behavioural activation]] (BA), [[functional analytic psychotherapy]] (FAP), [[integrative behavioural couples therapy]] and [[dialectical behavioural therapy]]. These approaches are squarely within the [[applied behaviour analysis]] tradition of behaviour therapy.

ACT may be the most well-researched of all the third-generation behaviour therapy models. It is based on [[relational frame theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Blackledge, J.T. (2003). An Introduction to Relational Frame Theory: Basics and Applications. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3(4), 421–42 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors object to the term "third generation" or "third wave" and incorporate many of the "third wave" therapeutic techniques under the general umbrella term of modern cognitive behavioral therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Hofmann SG |title= An Introduction to Modern CBT. Psychological Solutions to Mental Health Problems. |url= https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-CBT-Psychological-Solutions/dp/0470971754/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpi_10 |year= 2011 |publisher=Chichester, UK: Wiley-Blackwell |ISBN= 0-470-97175-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Functional analytic psychotherapy]] is based on a functional analysis of the therapeutic relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlenberg, R.J. &amp; Tsai, M. (1991) ''Functional Analytic Psychotherapy''. New York: Plenum&lt;/ref&gt; It places a greater emphasis on the therapeutic context and returns to the use of in-session reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Wulfert (2002) Can Contextual Therapies Save Clinical Behavior Analysis? ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3(3), 254 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; In general, 40 years of research supports the idea that in-session reinforcement of behaviour can lead to behavioural change.&lt;ref&gt;Cautilli, J.T.; Riley-Tillman, C.; Axelrod S. &amp; Hineline, P. (2005). The Role of Verbal Conditioning in Third Generation Behavior Therapy. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 6(2), 138–57 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Behavioural activation]] emerged from a component analysis of cognitive behaviour therapy. This research found no additive effect for the cognitive component.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, N.S.; Martell, C.R. &amp; Dimidjian, S. (2001). Behavioral activation treatment for depression: Returning to contextual roots. ''Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice'', 8, 255–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioural activation is based on a matching model of reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, J.M.; Spates, C.R; Pagoto, S. &amp; Doran, N. (2006). Behavioral Activation Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder: A Pilot Investigation. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 7(1), 151–64.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent review of the research, supports the notion that the use of behavioural activation is clinically important for the treatment of depression.&lt;ref&gt;Spates, C.R.; Pagoto, S. &amp; Kalata, A. (2006). A Qualitative And Quantitative Review of Behavioral Activation Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 7(4), 508–12 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Integrative behavioural couples therapy]] developed from dissatisfaction with traditional behavioural couples therapy. Integrative behavioural couples therapy looks to Skinner (1966) for the difference between contingency-shaped and rule-governed behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1969). ''Contingencies of Reinforcement: A Theoretical Analysis''. New York: Meredith Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; It couples this analysis with a thorough functional assessment of the couple's relationship. Recent efforts have used radical behavioural concepts to interpret a number of clinical phenomena including forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Cordova, J.; Cautilli, J.D.; Simon, C. &amp; Axelrod-sabag, R. (2006). Behavior Analysis of Forgiveness in Couples Therapy. ''IJBCT'', 2(2), 192–213 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizations===
Many organisations exist for behaviour therapists around the world. The [[Association for Behavior Analysis International]] provides accreditation for training programs in behaviour therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Behavior Analysis Accreditation Board |url=https://baab.abainternational.org/welcome.aspx |publisher=Association for Behavior Analysis International |accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[American Psychological Association]]'s Division 25 is the division for [[behaviour analysis]]. The Association for Contextual Behavior Therapy is another professional organisation. ACBS is home to many clinicians with specific interest in third generation behaviour therapy. The [[Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies]] (formerly the Association for the Advancement of Behavior Therapy) is for those with a more cognitive orientation.

There has been a development towards combining techniques to treat psychiatric disorders. Cognitive interventions are used to enhance the effects of more established behavioural interventions based on operant and classical conditioning. An increased effort has also been placed to address the interpersonal context of behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Craighead, L.W., Craighead, W.E.(1991). Behavior therapy:recent developments.

Shaping and graded task assignments has been used in dealing with suicide and depressed or inhibited individuals. This is used when a patient feel hopeless and they have no way of changing their lives. This hopelessness involves how the person reacts and responds to someone else and certain situations and their perceived powerlessness to change that situation that adds to the hopelessness. For a person with suicidal ideation, it is important to start with small steps. Because that person may perceive everything as being a big step, the smaller you start the easier it will be for the person to master each step.&lt;ref name="Freeman, Arthur 1989. Pg. 341"/&gt; This technique has also been applied to people dealing with agoraphobia, or fear of being in public places or doing something embarrassing.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, Scott W.

Contingency contracting is used to treat any behavioural problems that an individual may have.

Token economies are used in controlled environments and are found mostly in psychiatric hospitals.

===Treatment outcomes===
{{medical citations needed|section|date=September 2018}}
Systematic desensitization has been shown to successfully treat phobias about heights, driving, insects as well as any anxiety that a person may have. Anxiety can include social anxiety, anxiety about public speaking as well as test anxiety. It has been shown that the use of systematic desensitization is an effective technique that can be applied to a number of problems that a person may have.&lt;ref&gt;Bellack, Alan S., and Michel Hersen. Dictionary of Behavior Therapy Techniques, pp. 73. New York: Pergamon, 1985. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

When using modeling procedures this technique is often compared to another behavioural therapy technique. When compared to desensitization, the modeling technique does appear to be less effective.&lt;ref name="Bellack, Alan S. pp. 156"&gt;Bellack, Alan S., and Michel Hersen. Dictionary of Behavior Therapy Techniques, pp. 156. New York: Pergamon, 1985. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However it is clear that the greater the interaction between the patient and the subject he is modeling the greater the effectiveness of the treatment.&lt;ref name="Bellack, Alan S. pp. 156"/&gt;

While undergoing exposure therapy a person usually needs five sessions to see if the treatment is working. After five sessions exposure treatment is seen to benefit the patient and help with their problems. However even after five sessions it is recommended that the patient or client should still continue treatment.&lt;ref name="Bellack, Alan S. pp. 123"/&gt;

Virtual Reality treatment has shown to be effective for a fear of heights.&lt;ref name="Krijin, M. P.M"/&gt; It has also been shown to help with the treatment of a variety of anxiety disorders.&lt;ref name="Klein, R.A. 1999"/&gt; Virtual reality therapy can be very costly so therapists are still awaiting results of controlled trials for VR treatment to see which applications show the best results.&lt;ref&gt;Price, M., &amp; Anderson, P. (2007). The role of presence in virtual reality exposure therapy. Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 21, 724-751.&lt;/ref&gt;

For those with suicidal ideation treatment depends on how severe the person's depression and feeling of hopelessness is. If these things are severe the person's response to completing small steps will not be of importance to them because they don't consider it to be a big deal.&lt;ref name="Freeman, Arthur 1989. Pg. 341"/&gt; Generally those who aren't severely depressed or fearful, this technique has been successful because the completion of simpler activities build up their confidences and allows them to continue on to more complex situations.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, Scott W. "Knowledge and Skills for Intervention." Direct Practice in Social Work. Boston: Pearson/Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2006. Pp.232 . Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contingency contracts have been seen to be effective in changing any undesired behaviours of individuals. It has been seen to be effective in treating behaviour problems in delinquents regardless of the specific characteristics of the contract.&lt;ref name="Stuart, Richard B. 1972"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2018}}

Token economies have been shown to be effective when treating patients in psychiatric wards who had chronic schizophrenia. The results showed that the contingent tokens were controlling the behaviour of the patients.&lt;ref name="LLyod, Kenneth E. 1968"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2018}}

Response costs has been shown to work in suppressing a variety of behaviours such as smoking, overeating or stuttering with a diverse group of clinical populations ranging from sociopaths to school children. These behaviours that have been suppressed using this technique often do not recover when the punishment contingency is withdrawn. Also undesirable side effects that are usually seen with punishment are not typically found when using the response cost technique.&lt;ref name="Kazdin, Alan E 1972"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2018}}

==Characteristics==
By nature, behavioural therapies are empirical (data-driven), contextual (focused on the environment and context), functional (interested in the effect or consequence a behaviour ultimately has), probabilistic (viewing behaviour as statistically predictable), [[monistic]] (rejecting mind–body [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] and treating the person as a unit), and relational (analysing bidirectional interactions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sundberg |first=Norman |title=Clinical Psychology: Evolving Theory, Practice, and Research |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs |year=2001 |isbn=0-13-087119-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioural therapy develops, adds and provides behavioural intervention strategies and programs for clients, and training to people who care to facilitate successful lives in the communities.

'''Buddha-nature''' or '''Buddha Principle''' refers to several related terms,{{refn|group=note|Buddha-dhatu, mind, tathagatagarbha, Dharma-dhatu, suchness (tathata).{{sfn|Lusthaus|1998|p=84}}}} most notably ''tathāgatagarbha'' and ''buddhadhātu''.{{refn|group=note|Sanskrit; Jp. ''Busshō'', "Buddha-nature".}} ''Tathāgatagarbha'' means "the womb" or "embryo" (''garbha'') of the "thus-gone" (''tathagata''),{{refn|group=note|Enlightened one, a/the Buddha}} or "containing a tathagata", while ''buddhadhātu'' literally means "Buddha-realm" or "Buddha-substrate".{{refn|group=note|Kevin Trainor: "a sacred nature that is the basis for [beings'] becoming buddhas."{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=207}}}}

''Tathāgatagarbha'' has a wide range of (sometimes conflicting) meanings in Indian and later East Asian and Tibetan Buddhist literature. Debates on what the term means continues to be a major part of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhist]] scholastics.

For example, the Tibetan scholar [[Gö Lotsawa Zhönnu-pel|Go Lotsawa]] outlined four meanings of the term ''Tathāgatagarbha'' as used by Indian Buddhist scholars generally: (1) As an [[Rangtong-Shentong#Rangtong|emptiness that is a nonimplicative negation]], (2) the [[Luminous mind|luminous nature of the mind]], (3) [[Alaya-vijnana|alaya-vijñana]] (store-consciousness), (4) all [[bodhisattva]]s and sentient beings.&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2014, page 54"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

===Tathāgatagarbha===
The term ''tathāgatagarbha'' may mean "embryonic tathāgata",{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=44}} "womb of the tathāgata",{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}} or "containing a tathagata".{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=45}} Various meanings may all be brought into mind when the term ''tathagatagarbha'' is being used.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=45}}

====Compound====
The Sanskrit term ''tathāgatagarbha'' is a compound of two terms, ''[[tathāgata]]'' and ''garbha'':{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}
* ''tathāgata'' means "the one thus gone", referring to the Buddha. It is composed of "''tathā''" and "''āgata", "thus come"'',{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}} or ''"tathā"'' and ''"gata"'', ''"thus gone"''.{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, G. S. F., ed. (1972). ''A Dictionary of Buddhism''. (NB: with an "Introduction" by T. O. Ling.) New York, NY, USA: Charles Scribner's Sons. [I]SBN 684-12763-6 (trade cloth) p.240&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to a Buddha, who has "thus gone" from samsara into nirvana, and "thus come" from nirvana into samsara to work for the salvation of all sentient beings.{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}
* ''garbha'', "womb",{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=viii-ix}} "embryo",{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=viii-ix}} "center",{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=viii-ix}} "essence".{{sfn|Lopez|2001|p=263}}{{refn|group=note|According to Wayman &amp; Wayman, the term ''garbha'' takes on various meanings, depending on its context. They transalte a passage from the ''Sri-mala-sutra'' as follows: "Lord, this Tathagatagarbha is the Illustrious Dharmadhatu-womb, neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality. Is the dharmakaya-embryo, not the domain of beings who fall into the belief in a real personality. Is the supramundane ''dharma''-center, not the domain of beings who adhere to wayward views. Is the intrinsically pure ''dharma''-center, not the domain of beings who deviate from voidness".{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=ix}}}}

====Asian translations====
The Chinese translated the term ''tathāgatagarbha'' as ({{CJKV|t=如来藏|p=rúláizàng}},{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}} or "Tathāgata's (''rúlái'') storehouse" (''zàng'').{{sfn|King|1991|p=48}}{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=45}} According to Brown, "storehouse" may indicate both "that which enfolds or contains something",{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=45}} or "that which is itself enfolded, hidden or contained by another."{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=45}} The Tibetan translation is ''de bzhin gsegs pa'i snyin po'', which cannot be translated as "womb" (''mngal'' or ''lhums''), but as "embryonic essence", "kernel" or "heart".{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=45}} The term "heart" was also used by Mongolian translators.{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=45}}

====Western translations====
The term ''tathagatagarbha'' is translated and interpreted in various ways by western translators and scholars:
* According to Sally King, the term ''tathāgatagarbha'' may be understood in two ways:{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}
# "embryonic tathāgata", the incipient Buddha, the ''cause'' of the Tathāgata,
# "womb of the tathāgata", the ''fruit'' of Tathāgata. 
:According to King, the Chinese ''rúláizàng'' was taken in its meaning as "womb" or "fruit".{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}} 
* Wayman &amp; Wayman also point out that the Chinese regularly takes ''garbha'' as "womb",{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=ix}} but prefer to use the term "embryo".
* According to Brown, following Wayman &amp; Wayman, "embryo" is the best fitting translation, since it preserves "the dynamic, self-transformative nature of the ''tathagatagarbha''."{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=44}}
* According to Zimmerman, ''garbha'' may also mean the interior or center of something,{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=40}} and its essence or central part.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=41}} As a ''[[tatpurusa]]''{{refn|group=note|In [[Sanskrit grammar]] a '''{{IAST|tatpuruṣa}}''' (तत्पुरुष) compound is a dependent determinative [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]], i.e. a compound XY meaning a type of Y which is related to X in a way corresponding to one of the grammatical cases of X.}} it may refer to a person ''being'' a "womb" for or "container" of the tathagata.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=44}} As a ''[[bahuvrihi]]''{{refn|group=note|A '''bahuvrihi compound''' (from Sanskrit बहुव्रीहि, ''bahuvrīhi'', literally meaning "much rice" but denoting a rich man) is a type of compound that denotes a referent by specifying a certain characteristic or quality the referent possesses.}} it may refer to a person as ''having'' an embryonic tathagata inside.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=44}} In both cases, this embryonic tathagata still has to be developed.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=44}} Zimmerman concludes that ''tathagatagarbha'' is a ''bahuvrihi'', meaning "containing a tathagata",{{refn|group=note|In the ''Maraparinirvana Sutra'' the term ''tathagatagarbha'' replaces the term ''buddhadhatu'', which originally referred to relics. Worship of the physical relics of the Buddha was reshaped into worship of the inner Buddha.{{sfn|Jikido|2000|p=73}}}} but notes the variety of meanings of ''garbha'', such as "containing", "born from", "embryo", "(embracing/concealing) womb", "calyx", "child", "member of a clan", "core", which may all be brought into mind when the term ''tathagatagarbha'' is being used.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=45}}

===Buddha-nature===
The term "Buddha-nature" ({{CJKV|t=佛性|p=fóxìng}}, {{CJKV|j=busshō}}{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}) is closely related in meaning to the term ''tathāgatagarbha'', but is not a translation of this term.{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}{{refn|group=note|For the various equivalents of the Sanskrit term "''tathāgatagarbha''" in other languages (Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese), see [[Glossary of Buddhism]], "tathagatagarbha"}} It refers to what is essential in the human being.{{sfn|King|1991|p=5}}

The corresponding Sanskrit term is ''buddhadhātu''.{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}} It has two meanings, namely the nature of the Buddha, equivalent to the term [[dharmakāya]], and the cause of the Buddha.{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}} The link between the cause and the result is the nature (''dhātu'') which is common to both, namely the dharmadhātu.{{sfn|King|1991|p=5}}

Matsumoto Shirō also points out that "Buddha-nature" translates the Sanskrit-term buddhadhātu, a "place to put something," a "foundation," a "locus."{{sfn|Shirō|1997|p=169}} According to Shirō, it does not mean "original nature" or "essence," nor does it mean the "possibility of the attainment of Buddhahood," "the original nature of the Buddha," or "the essence of the Buddha."{{sfn|Shirō|1997|p=169}}

In the [[Vajrayana]], the term for Buddha-nature is ''sugatagarbha''.

==Indian Sutra sources==
===Earliest sources===
According to Wayman, the idea of the tathagatagarbha is grounded on sayings by the Buddha that there is something called the [[luminous mind]]{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=42}} (''prabhasvara citta''{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=288-289}}), "which is only adventitiously covered over by defilements ([[Kleshas (Buddhism)|agantukaklesa]])"{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=288-289}} The luminous mind is mentioned in a passage from the [[Anguttara Nikaya]]:{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=56}} "Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is defiled by incoming defilements."&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, trans. (1995). [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an01/an01.049.than.html Pabhassara Sutta: Luminous], (Anguttara Nikaya 1.49-52)&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Harvey mentions AN 1.10: "Monks, this mind (''[[citta]]'') is brightly shining (''pabhassara''), but it is defiled by defilements which arrive". AN 1.49-52 gives a similar statement}} The [[Mahāsāṃghika]] school coupled this idea of the luminous mind with the idea of the [[Eight Consciousnesses|mulavijnana]], the substratum consciousness that serves as the basis consciousness.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=42}}

From the idea of the luminous mind emerged the idea that the awakened mind is the pure (''visuddhi''), undefiled mind. In the [[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras|tathagatagarbha-sutras]] it is this pure consciousness that is regarded to be the seed from which Buddhahood grows:
{{quote|When this intrinsically pure consciousness came to be regarded as an element capable of growing into [[Buddhahood]], there was the "embryo (''garbha'') of the Tathagata (&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;Buddha)" doctrine, whether or not this term is employed.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=42}}}}Karl Brunnholzl writes that the first probable mention of the term is in the ''Ekottarika [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agama]]'' (though here it is used in a different way then in later texts). The passage states:&lt;blockquote&gt;If someone devotes himself to the Ekottarikagama, Then he has the ''tathagatagarbha''. Even if his body cannot exhaust defilements in this life, In his next life he will attain supreme wisdom.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This tathāgatagarbha idea was the result of an interplay between various strands of Buddhist thought, on the nature of human consciousness and the means of awakening.{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=161}}{{sfn|Lusthaus|1998}}{{sfn|Lai}} Gregory comments on this origin of the Tathagatagarba-doctrine: "The implication of this doctrine [...] is that enlightenment is the natural and true state of the mind."{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=288-289}}

===''Avatamsaka Sutra''===
According to Wayman, the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avataṃsaka Sūtra]]'' (1st-3rd century CE) was the next step in the development of the Buddha-nature thought after the concept of the luminous mind:

{{quote|[W]here it is taught that the Buddha's divine knowledge pervades sentient beings, and that its representation in an individual being is the substratum consciousness.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=42}}}}
The ''Avataṃsaka Sūtra'' does not contain a "singular discussion of the concept",{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=44}} but the idea of "a universal penetration of sentient beings by the wisdom of the Buddha (''buddhajñāna'')" was complementary to the concept of the Buddha-womb.{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=44}}
The basic idea of the ''Avataṃsaka Sūtra '' is the unity of the absolute and the relative:

{{quote|All in One, One in All. The All melts into a single whole. There are no divisions in the totality of reality [...] [I]t views the cosmos as holy, as "one bright pearl," the universal reality of the Buddha. The universal Buddhahood of all reality is the religious message of the Avatamsaka-sutra.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005|p=46-47}}{{refn|group=note|Each part of the world reflects the totality of the cosmos:&lt;br&gt;
quote|In each dust-mote of these worlds&lt;br&gt;
Are countless worlds and Buddhas...&lt;br&gt;
From the tip of each hair of Buddha's body&lt;br&gt;
Are revealed the indescribable Pure Lands...&lt;br&gt;
The indescribable infinite Lands&lt;br&gt;
All ensemble in a hair's tip [of Buddha].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005|p=47}}}}}}

All levels of reality are related and interpenetrated. This is depicted in the image of [[Indra's net]]. This "unity in totality allows every individual entity of the phenomenal world its uniqueness without attributing an inherent nature to anything".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005|p=47}}

===''Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra'' ===
The ''[[Lotus Sutra]] (''Skt'': Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra)'', written between 100 BCE and 200 CE, does not mention Buddha-nature, but shares other themes and ideas with the later [[tathāgatagarbha sūtras]] like the ''tathāgatagarbha sūtra'' and some scholars theorize that it was an influence on these texts.&lt;ref name="Reeves"&gt;{{harvnb|Reeves|2008|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tenth chapter emphasizes, in accordance with the Bodhisattva-ideal of the Mahayana teachings, that everyone can be liberated. All living beings can become a buddha, not only  monks and nuns, but also laypeople, [[śrāvaka]]s, [[bodhisattva]]s, and non-human creatures.&lt;ref name="Reeves" /&gt; It also details that all living beings can be a 'teacher of the Dharma'.

The twelfth chapter of the ''Lotus Sutra'' details that the potential to become enlightened is universal among all people, even the historical [[Devadatta]] has the potential to become a buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reeves|2008|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Devadatta is followed by another story about a [[Longnü|dragon princess]] who is both a [[nāga]] and a female, whom the bodhisattva [[Manjusri|Mañjuśrī]] proclaims will reach enlightenment immediately, in her present form.

===''Tathāgatagarbha Sūtras''===
{{Main|Tathāgatagarbha sūtras}}
There are several major Indian texts which discuss the idea of Buddha-nature and they are often termed the [[tathāgatagarbha sūtras]]. According to Brunnholzl "the earliest [[mahayana sutras]] that are based on and discuss the notion of tathagatagarbha as the buddha potential that is innate in all sentient beings began to appear in written form in the late second and early third century."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their ideas became very influential in [[East Asian Buddhism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Mahayana sutras which mention this doctrine include the [[Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra|''Tathāgatagarbha sūtra'']], ''[[Anunatva-Apurnatva-Nirdesa]],'' ''[[Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra]],'' ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]], [[Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra]]'' and the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;''

The ''[[Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra]]'' (200-250 CE) is considered (...) "the earliest expression of this (the tathāgatagarbha doctrine) and the term ''tathāgatagarbha'' itself seems to have been coined in this very sutra."{{sfn|Zimmermann|1999|p=143–168}} It states that one is already or primordially awakened and that all beings already have perfect [[buddhahood]] within themselves but do not recognize it because it is covered over by afflictions.&lt;ref&gt;Padma, Sree. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' 2008. pp. 152&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=47-48}}{{sfn|Zimmermann|2002|p=39 ff. and 50 ff.}}&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another one of these texts, the ''Ghanavyuha Sutra'' (as quoted by [[Longchenpa]]) states that the tathāgatagarbha is the ground of all things:

{{quote|... the ultimate universal ground also has always been with the Buddha-Essence (Tathagatagarbha), and this essence in terms of the universal ground has been taught by the Tathagata. The fools who do not know it, because of their habits, see even the universal ground as (having) various happiness and suffering and actions and emotional defilements. Its nature is pure and immaculate, its qualities are as wishing-jewels; there are neither changes nor cessations. Whoever realizes it attains Liberation&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Thondup Rinpoche, Tulku (1989). ''Buddha Mind''. Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion: p.218&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra''===
The ''Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra'' (3rd century CE{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=2}}), also named ''The Lion's Roar of Queen Srimala'', centers on the teaching of the tathagatagarbha as "ultimate soteriological principle".{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=10}} Regarding the tathāgatagarbha, it states:

{{quote|Lord, the Tathagatagarbha is neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality. The Tathagatagarbha is not the domain of beings who fall into the belief in a real personality, who adhere to wayward views, whose thoughts are distracted by voidness. Lord, this Tathagatagarbha is the embryo of the Illustrious Dharmadhatu, the embryo of the Dharmakaya, the embryo of the supramundane ''dharma'', the embryo of the intrinsically pure ''dharma''.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=106}}}}

In the ''Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra'' there are two possible states for the tathāgatagarbha:

{{quote|[E]ither covered by defilements, when it is called only "embryo of the Tathagata"; or free from defilements, when the "embryo of the Tathagata" is no more the "embryo" (potentiality) but the Tathagata (actuality).{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=45}}}}

The sutra itself states it this way:

{{quote|This Dharmakaya of the Tathagata when not free from the store of defilement is referred to as the Tathagatagarbha.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=98}}}}

===''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra''===
[[File:Sui Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra.JPG|thumb|A [[Sui dynasty]] manuscript of the ''Nirvāṇa Sūtra'']]
The early Buddha-nature concept as expressed in the seminal 'tathagatagarbha sutra' named the ''Nirvana Sutra'' is, according to Kevin Trainor, as follows: "Sentient beings are said to possess a sacred nature that is the basis for them becoming buddhas [...] this buddha-nature is in fact our true nature [...] universal and completely unsullied by whatever psychological and karmic state an individual may be in."{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=207}}

The ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' (written 2nd century CE) was very influential in the Chinese reception of the Buddhist teachings.{{sfn|Lai}} The ''Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' linked the concept of tathāgatagarbha with the buddhadhātu.{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} Kosho Yamamoto points out that the ''Nirvana Sutra'' contains a series of equations: "Thus, there comes about the equation of: Buddha Body &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; Dharmakaya &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; eternal body &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; eternal Buddha &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; Eternity."{{sfn|Yamamoto|1975}} According to Shimoda Masahiro, the authors of the ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' were  leaders and advocates of stupa worship. The term ''buddhadhātu'' originally referred to relics. In the ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'', it came to be used in place of the concept of ''tathāgatagārbha''. The authors used the teachings of the ''Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra'' to reshape the worship of the physical relics of the Buddha into worship of the inner Buddha as a principle of salvation.{{sfn|Jikido|2000|p=73}} Sasaki, in a review of Shimoda, conveys a key premise of Shimoda's work, namely, that the origins of Mahayana Buddhism and the ''Nirvana Sutra'' are entwined.{{sfn|Sasaki|1999}}

The Buddha-nature is always present, in all times and in all beings. This does not mean that sentient beings are at present endowed with the qualities of a Buddha, but that they will have those qualities in the future.{{sfn|Liu|1982|p=66-67}} It is obscured from worldly vision by the screening effect of tenacious negative mental afflictions within each being.{{refn|group=note|The most notable of which are greed 貪, hatred 嗔, delusion 癡, and pride 慢}} Once these negative mental states have been eliminated, however, the Buddha-dhatu is said to shine forth unimpededly and the Buddha-sphere (Buddha-dhatu/ visaya) can then be consciously "entered into", and therewith deathless Nirvana attained:{{sfn|Yamamoto|1975|p=94–96}}

{{quote|[T]he tathagatagarbha is none but Thusness or the Buddha Nature, and is the originally untainted pure mind which lies overspread by, and exists in, the mind of greed and anger of all beings. This bespeaks a Buddha Body that exists in a state of bondage.{{sfn|Yamamoto|1975|p=87}}}}

According to Sallie B. King, it does not represent a major innovation, and is rather unsystematic,{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} which made it "a fruitful one for later students and commentators, who were obliged to create their own order and bring it to the text".{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} According to King, its most important innovation is the linking of the term ''buddhadhatu'' with ''tathagatagarbha''.{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} The sutra presents the Buddha-nature or tathagatagarbha as a "Self". The ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' refers to a true self.  "The ''Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṅa Sūtra'', especially influential in East Asian Buddhist thought, goes so far as to speak of it as our true self (ātman). Its precise metaphysical and ontological status is, however, open to interpretation in the terms of different Mahāyāna philosophical schools; for the Madhyamikas it must be empty of its own existence like everything else; for the Yogacarins, following the Laṅkāvatāra, it can be identified with store consciousness, as the receptacle of the seeds of awakening.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=52}}  Paul Williams states: "[...] it is obvious that the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' does not consider it impossible for a Buddhist to affirm an atman provided it is clear what the correct understanding of this concept is, and indeed the sutra clearly sees certain advantages in doing so."{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=163-164}} but it speaks about Buddha-nature in so many different ways, that Chinese scholars created a list of types of Buddha-nature that could be found in the text.{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} Paul Williams also notes:

{{quote|Nevertheless the sutra as it stands is quite clear that while [...] we can speak of [the tathagatagharba] as Self, actually it is not at all a Self, and those who have such Self-notions cannot perceive the tathagatagarbha and thus become enlightened (see Ruegg 1989a: 21-6).{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=163-164}}}}

===''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra''===
The ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]'' (compiled 350-400 CE&lt;ref name="KaluPhy"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.fi/books?id=SlDArya3YvcC&amp;lpg=PA275&amp;ots=ISCxmxGp_c&amp;dq=A%20history%20of%20Buddhist%20philosophy&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20history%20of%20Buddhist%20philosophy&amp;f=false|title=A History of Buddhist Philosophy: Continuities and Discontinuities|last1=Kalupahana|first1=David J.|date=1992|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=9780824814021|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) synthesized the tathagatagarba-doctrine and the [[Eight Consciousnesses#Ālayavijñāna|ālāya-vijñāna]] doctrine. The Lankavatara Sutra "assimilates Tathagata-garbha thought to the Yogacara-viewpoint, and this assimilation is further developed in [...] The Treatise on the Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana".{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=114}} According to the Lankavatara Sutra ''tathāgatagarbha'' is identical to the ''ālaya-vijñāna'', known prior to awakening as the storehouse-consciousness or 8th consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, D.T., trans. (1932) ''The Lankavatara Sutra''. London: Routledge &amp; Kegen Paul: Section LXXXII, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; The ālāya-vijñāna is supposed to contain the pure seed, or tathagatagarbha, from which awakening arises.{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=288-289}}

The Lankavatara-sutra contains tathagata-garba thought, but also warns against reification of the idea of Buddha-nature, and presents it as an aid to attaining awakening:

{{quote|Is not this Tathagata-garbha taught by the Blessed One the same as the ego-substance taught by the philosophers? The ego as taught by the philosophers is an eternal creator, unqualified, omnipresent, and imperishable.&lt;br&gt;
The Blessed One replied: [...] it is emptiness, reality-limit, Nirvana, being unborn, unqualified, and devoid of will-effort; the reason why the Tathagatas [...] teach the doctrine pointing to the Tathagata-garba is to make the ignorant cast aside their fear when they listen to the teaching of egolessness and to have them realise the state of non-discrimination and imagelessness&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, D.T. (1956), ''The Lankavatara Sutra. A Mahayana Text.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd. p.69&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Alex and Hideko Wayman, the equation of tathagatagarbha and ālāya-vijñāna in the Lankavatara fails:

{{quote|It is plain that when the ''Lankavatara-sutra'' identifies the two terms, this scripture necessarily diverges in the meaning of one or both of the terms from the usage of the term Tathagatagarbha in the earlier ''Sri-Mala'' or of the term ''ālāya-vijñāna '' in the subsequent Yogacara school.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=53}}{{refn|group=note|In the [[Menngagde|Seminal Heart]] series of [[Dzogchen]] a distinction is made between ''kun gzhi'', c.q. ''ālaya'', "the base of it all", the samsaric basis of consciousness, of all the samsaric appearances; and ''[[Ground (Dzogchen)|gzhi]]'', "the nirvanic basis known as the ground."{{sfn|Schaik|2004}} Sam van Schaik: "....the Seminal Heart distinction between two types of basis, the nirvanic basis known as the ground (gzhi) and the samsaric basis of consciousness, the ālaya (kun gzhi).{{sfn|Schaik|2004}} [[Philip Kapleau]], in "The Three Pillars of Zen", drawing from Harada roshi, discerns a "Pure Consciousness" or "Formless Self" underlying the ālāya-vijñāna.{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}} This 9th consciousness was also mentioned by Paramārtha, a 6th century Indian translator working in China.{{sfn|Lusthaus|1998|p=84}}}}}}

==In Indian commentaries==
The ''tathāgatagarbha'' doctrine was also widely discussed by Indian Mahayana scholars in treatises or commentaries, called [[shastra|śāstra]], the most influential of which was the [[Ratnagotravibhāga]] (5th century CE).

===''Ratnagotravibhāga'' or ''Uttaratantraśāstra''===
The [[Ratnagotravibhāga]], also called ''Uttaratantraśāstra'' (5th century CE), is an Indian [[shastra|śāstra]] in which synthesised all the major elements and themes of the tathāgatagārbha theory.{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=44}} It gives an overview of authoritative tathāgatagarbha sutras, mentioning the ''Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra'', the ''Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra'', ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'', the ''[[Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra]]'', the ''[[Anunatva-Apurnatva-Nirdesa]]'' and the ''Mahābherīharaka-sūtra''.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=43}} It presents the tathāgatagarbha as "an ultimate, unconditional reality that is simultaneously the inherent, dynamic process towards its complete manifestation".{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=46}} Mundane and enlightened reality are seen as complementary:

{{quote|Thusness [''tathata''] defiled is the Tathagatagarbha, and Thusness undefiled is Enlightenment.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=45}}}}

In the ''Ratnagotravibhāga'', the tathāgatagarbha is seen as having three specific characteristics: (1) [[Dharmakāya|dharmakaya]], (2) [[suchness]], and (3) disposition, as well as the general characteristic (4) non-[[Conceptual proliferation|conceptuality]].&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2014, page 54"/&gt;

According to the ''Ratnagotravibhāga'', all sentient beings have "the embryo of the Tathagata" in three senses:{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=46}}

# the Tathāgata's dharmakāya permeates all sentient beings;
# the Tathāgata's ''[[tathatā]]'' is omnipresent (''avyatibheda'');
# the Tathāgata's species (''gotra'', a synonym for tathagatagarbha) occurs in them.

The Ratnagotravibhāga equates enlightenment with the nirvāṇa-realm and the dharmakāya.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=45}} It gives a variety of synonyms for ''garbha'', the most frequently used being ''gotra'' and ''dhatu''.{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=46}}

This text also explains the tathāgatagarbha in terms of [[luminous mind]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;The luminous nature of the mind Is unchanging, just like space.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Madhyamaka school ===
Indian [[Madhyamaka]] philosophers interpreted the theory as a description of [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] and as a non implicative negation. [[Bhāviveka|Bhaviveka]]'s ''Tarkajvala'' states:&lt;blockquote&gt;[The expression] “possessing the tathagata heart” is [used] because emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, and so on, exist in the mind streams of all sentient beings. However, it is not something like a permanent and all-pervasive person that is the inner agent. For we find [passages] such as “All phenomena have the nature of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness. What is emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness is the Tathagata.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Chandrakirti|Candrakirti]]'s ''Madhyamakāvatārabhāsya'' states:&lt;blockquote&gt;One should know that since [the alaya-consciousness] follows the nature of all entities, it is nothing but emptiness that is taught through the term “alaya-consciousness.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Gö Lotsawa Zhönnu-pel|Go Lotsawa]] states that this statement is referencing the tathāgatagarbha doctrine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Candrakirti's ''Madhyamakāvatārabhāsya'' also argues, basing itself on the Lankavatara sutra, that "the statement of the emptiness of sentient beings being a buddha adorned with all major and minor marks is of expedient meaning".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Kamalaśīla|Kamalasila]]'s (c. 740-795) ''Madhyamakaloka'' associates tathāgatagarbha with [[Luminous mind|luminosity]] and luminosity with [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;This statement “All sentient beings possess the tathāgata heart” teaches that all are suitable to attain the state of unsurpassable completely perfect awakening since it is held that the term tathāgata expresses that the dharmadhātu, which is characterized by personal and phenomenal identitylessness, is natural luminosity.&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2014, page 56"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Uniquely among [[Madhyamaka]] texts, some texts attributed to [[Nagarjuna]], mainly poetic works like the ''[[Dharmadhātustava|Dharmadhatustava]], Cittavajrastava'', and ''Bodhicittavivarana'' associate the term tathāgatagarbha with the [[Luminous mind|luminous nature of the mind]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Yogacara scholars===
{{See also|Eight Consciousnesses#Transformations of consciousness|l1=Transformations of consciousness}}

According to Brunnholzl, "all early Indian Yogacara masters (such as [[Asanga]], [[Vasubandhu]], [[Sthiramati]], and Asvabhava), if they refer to the term tathāgatagarbha at all, always explain it as nothing but [[Tathātā|suchness]] in the sense of twofold identitylessness".&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2014, page 56"/&gt;

Some later Yogacara scholars spoke of the tathāgatagarbha in more positive terms, such as Jñanasrimitra who in his ''Sakarasiddhi'' equates it with the appearances of lucidity (prakasarupa). Likewise, Brunnholzl notes that "[[Ratnākaraśānti|Ratnakarasanti]] generally describes the tathagata heart as being equivalent to naturally luminous mind, nondual self-awareness, and the perfect nature (which he considers to be an implicative negation and not a nonimplicative negation)."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alaya-vijñana ===
The Yogacara concept of the [[Eight Consciousnesses|alaya-vijñana]] (store consciousness) also came to be associated by some scholars with the tathāgatagarbha. This can be seen in sutras like the Lankavatara, the Srimaladevi and in the translations of [[Paramartha]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the ālaya-vijñāna originally meant defiled consciousness: defiled by the workings of [[Ayatana|the five senses and the mind]]. It was also seen as the mūla-vijñāna, the base-consciousness or "stream of consciousness" from which awareness and perception spring.&lt;ref name="KaluPsy"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Principles%20of%20Buddhist%20Psychology_Kalupahana.pdf|title=The Principles of Buddhist Psychology|last1=Kalupahana|first1=David J.|date=1987|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=9780887064043|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To account for the notion of Buddha-nature in all beings, with the Yogacara belief in the [[Yogacara#Five Categories of Beings|Five Categories of Beings]], Yogacara scholars in China such as Tz'u-en (慈恩, 632-682) the first patriarch in China, advocated two types of nature: the latent nature found in all beings (理佛性) and the Buddha-nature in practice (行佛性). The latter nature was determined by the innate [[Bīja|seeds]] in the alaya.&lt;ref name="groner"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Establishment of the Tendai School|last=Groner|first=Paul|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2000|isbn=0824823710|pages=97–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trikaya doctrine===
Around 300 CE, the Yogacara school systematized the prevalent ideas on the nature of the Buddha in the [[Trikaya]] or ''three-body doctrine''. According to this doctrine, Buddhahood has three aspects:{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=126}}
# The Nirmana-kaya, or ''Transformation-body'', the earthly manifestation of the Buddha;
# The [[Sambhogakāya]], or ''Enjoyment-body'', a subtle body, by which the Buddha appears to bodhisattvas to teach them;
# The Dharmakāya, or ''Dharma-body'', the ultimate nature of the Buddha, and the ultimate nature of reality.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

They may be described as follows:
{{quote|The first is the 'Knowledge-body' (''Jnana-kaya''), the inner nature shared by all Buddhas, their Buddha-ness (''buddhata'')&lt;br&gt;[...] The second aspect of the ''Dharma-body'' is the 'Self-existent-body' (''Svabhavika-kaya''). This is the ultimate nature of reality, thusness, emptiness: the non-nature which is the very nature of ''dharmas'', their ''dharma''-ness (''dharmata''). It is the ''Tathagata-garbha'' and ''[[bodhicitta]]'' hidden within beings, and the transformed 'storehouse-consciousness'.}}

==In Chinese Buddhism==
The [[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras|tathāgatagarbha]] idea was extremely influential in the development of [[East Asian Buddhism]].{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=161}} When Buddhism was introduced to China, in the 1st century CE, Buddhism was understood through comparisons of its teachings to Chinese terms and ways of thinking. Chinese Buddhist thinkers like Zhi Mindu, Zhidun, and Huiyuan (d. 433) interpreted Buddhist concepts in terms of the Chinese [[Xuanxue|neo-daoist]] philosophy called ‘dark learning’ (''xuanxue'').&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Hurley, Scott, The doctrinal transformation of twentieth-century Chinese Buddhism: Master Yinshun’s interpretation of the tathagatagarbha doctrine, Contemporary Buddhism, Vol. 5, No. 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency was only later countered by the work of [[East Asian Mādhyamaka|Chinese Madhyamaka]] scholar-translators like [[Kumārajīva|Kumarajiva]].

The buddha nature idea was introduced into China with the translation of the [[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra|Mahaparanirvana sutra]] in the early fifth century and this text became the central source of buddha nature doctrine in Chinese Buddhism.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Liu , Ming-Wood. The Yogaacaaraa and Maadhyamika Interpretation of the Buddha-nature Concept in Chinese Buddhism, Philosophy East and West, Volume 35, no. 2, April 1985 P.171-192 © by University of Hawaii Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on their understanding of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra some Chinese Buddhists supposed that the teaching of the Buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths.{{sfn|Lai|p=11}} This idea was interpreted as being similar to the ideas of [[Tao|Dao]] and [[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|Principle (Li)]] in Chinese philosophy.

===The Awakening of Faith===
[[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana|The Awakening of Faith]] was very influential in the development of Chinese Buddhism {{sfn|Lai}} said to have been translated by [[Paramartha]] (499-569). While the text is traditionally attributed to [[{{IAST|Aśvaghoṣa}}]], no Sanskrit version of the text is extant. The earliest known versions are written in Chinese, and contemporary scholars believe that the text is a Chinese composition.&lt;ref&gt;Nattier, Jan. The Heart Sūtra: A Chinese Apocryphal Text? ''Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies'' Vol. 15 (2), 180-81, 1992. [http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8800/2707 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chinese Buddhist Apocrypha'' by Robert E. Buswell. University of Hawaii Press: 1990. {{ISBN|0-8248-1253-0}}. pgs 1-29&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana'' offers a synthesis of Chinese buddhist thinking.{{sfn|Lai|p=11-12}} It sees the Buddha-nature doctrine as a cosmological theory, in contrast to the Indo-Tibetan tradition, where the soteriological aspect is emphasized.{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=109-110}} It described the "One Mind" which "includes in itself all states of being of the phenomenal and transcendental world".{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=109-110}} It tried to harmonize the ideas of the tathāgatagarbha and ālāya-vijñāna:
{{quote|In the words of the Awakening of Faith — which summarizes the essentials of Mahayana — self and world, mind and suchness, are integrally one. Everything is a carrier of that a priori enlightenment; all incipient enlightenment is predicated on it. The mystery of existence is, then, not, "How may we overcome alienation?" The challenge is, rather, "Why do we think we are lost in the first place?"{{sfn|Lai}}}}

In the Awakening of Faith the 'one mind' has two aspects, namely tathata, suchness, the things as they are, and samsara, the cycle of birth and death.{{sfn|Lai|p=11-12}} This text was in line with an essay by [[Emperor Wu of Liang|Emperor Wu]] of the [[Liang dynasty]] (reign 502-549 CE), in which he postulated a pure essence, the enlightened mind, trapped in darkness, which is ignorance. By this ignorance the pure mind is trapped in samsara. This resembles the tathāgatagarba and the idea of the defilement of the luminous mind.{{sfn|Lai|p=11-12}} In a commentary on this essay [[Shen Yue]] stated that insight into this true essence is awakened by stopping the thoughts - a point of view which is also being found in the ''[[Platform Sutra]]'' of [[Huineng]].{{sfn|Lai|p=11-12}}

The joining together of these different ideas supported the notion of the [[ekayāna]], the one vehicle: absolute oneness, all-pervading Buddha-wisdom and [[hongaku|original enlightenment]] as a holistic whole. This synthesis was a reflection of the unity which was attained in China with the united [[Song dynasty]].{{sfn|Lai|p=12-13}}

=== In Chinese Yogacara and Madhyamaka ===
By the 6th century CE buddha nature had been well established in Chinese Buddhism and a wide variety of theories developed to explain it.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; One influential figure who wrote about buddha nature was Ching-ying Hui-yuan (523-592 CE), a [[East Asian Yogācāra|Chinese Yogacarin]] who argued for a kind of idealism which held that: &lt;blockquote&gt;"All dharmas without exception originate and are formed from the true[-mind], and other than the true[-mind], there exists absolutely nothing which can give rise to false thoughts."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Ching-ying Hui-yuan equated this 'true mind' with the alaya-vijñana, the tathāgatagarbha and "Buddha-nature" (''fóxìng'') and held that it was an essence, a true consciousness and a metaphysical principle that ensured that all sentient beings will reach enlightenment.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; According to Ming-Wood Liu "Hui-yuan's interpretation of the Buddha-nature doctrine represents the culmination of a long process of transformation of the "Buddha-nature" from a basically practical to an ontological concept."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The Chinese Yogacara school was also split on the relationship between the tathāgatagarbha and ālayavijñāna. Fa-shang (495-580), representing the southern Yogacara, asserted that they were separate, that the alaya was illusiory and impure while buddha nature was the ultimate source of all phenomenal reality.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Seong-Uk Kim, Understanding Tsung-Mi's view on Buddha nature, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the northern school meanwhile, it was held that the alaya and buddha nature were the same pure support for all phenomena.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt; In the sixth and seventh centuries, the Yogacara theory became associated with a substantialist non-dual metaphysics which saw buddha nature as an eternalistic ground. This idea was promoted by figures like [[Fazang]] and Ratnamati.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In contrast with the Chinese Yogacara view, the [[East Asian Mādhyamaka|Chinese Madhyamaka]] scholar [[Jizang]] (549–623 CE) sought to remove all ontological connotations of the term as a metaphysical reality and saw buddha nature as being synonymous with terms like "[[Tathātā|tathata]]," "[[dharmadhatu]]," "ekayana," "wisdom, &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; "ultimate reality," "middle way" and also the wisdom that contemplates [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In formulating his view, Jizang was influenced by the earlier Chinese Madhyamaka thinker [[Sengzhao]] (384–414 CE) who was a key figure in outlining an understanding of emptiness which was based on the Indian sources and not on Daoist concepts which previous Chinese Buddhists had used.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Jizang used the compound “Middle Way-buddha nature” (''zhongdao foxing'' 中道佛 性) to refer to his view.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;CHIH-MIEN ADRIAN TSENG, A COMPARISON OF THE CONCEPTS OF BUDDHA-NATURE AND DAO-NATURE OF MEDIEVAL CHINA.&lt;/ref&gt; Jizang was also one of the first Chinese philosophers to famously argue that plants and insentient objects have Buddha nature, which he also termed true reality and universal principle (''dao'').&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In the 20th century, the influential Chinese master [[Yin Shun]] drew on Chinese Madhyamaka to argue against any Yogacara influenced view that buddha nature was an underlying permanent ground of reality and instead supported the view that buddha nature teachings are just an expedient means.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Yin Shun, drawing on his study of Indian Madhyamaka promoted the emptiness of all things as the ultimate Buddhist truth, and argued that the buddha nature teaching was a provisional teaching taught in order to ease the fear of some Buddhists regarding emptiness as well as to attract those people who have an affinity to the idea of a Self or [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Later after taking up the Buddhist path, they would be introduced to the truth of emptiness.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== In Tiantai ===
In the [[Tiantai]] school, the primary figure is the scholar [[Zhiyi]]. According to Paul L. Swanson, none of Zhiyi's works discuss buddha nature explicitly at length however. Yet it is still an important concept in his philosophy, which is seen as synonymous with the [[Ekayāna|ekayana]] principle outlined in the [[Lotus Sutra]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Swanson, Paul L, T'ien-t'ai Chih-i's Concept of Threefold Buddha Nature-A Synergy of Reality, Wisdom, and Practice&lt;/ref&gt; Swanson argues that for Zhiyi, buddha nature is:&lt;blockquote&gt;an active threefold process which involves the way reality is, the wisdom to see reality as it is, and the practice required to attain this wisdom. Buddha Nature is threefold: the three aspects of reality, wisdom, and practice are interdependent--one aspect does not make any sense without the others.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Buddha nature for Zhiyi therefore has three aspects which he bases on passages from the [[Lotus Sutra|Lotus sutra]] and the Nirvana sutra:&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

# The direct cause of attaining Buddhahood, the innate potential in all sentient beings to become Buddhas, which is the aspect of 'true nature', the way things are.
# The complete cause of attaining Buddhahood, which is the aspect of wisdom that illuminates the true nature and the goal of practice.
# The conditional causes of attaining Buddhahood, which is the aspect of the practices and activities that lead to Buddhahood.

The later Tiantai scholar [[Zhanran]] would expand the Tiantai view of buddha nature, which he saw as synonymous with [[Tathātā|suchness]], to argue for the idea that insentient rocks and plants also have buddha nature.&lt;ref&gt;Shuman Chen. Buddha-Nature of Insentient Beings. Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion , 2nd ed., vol. 1, pp. 208-212, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Chan Buddhism===
In [[Chan Buddhism]], buddha nature tends to be seen as the (non-substantial) essential nature of all beings. But the Zen tradition also emphasizes that buddha nature is [[śūnyatā]], the absence of an independent and substantial "self".{{sfn|Lai}}

''Ch'an and Zen Teaching First Series''.  Berkeley, CA.: Shambala publications: Part I: ''Master Hsu Yun's Discourses and Dharma Words'': pp. 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt; have all taught that the process of awakening begins with the light of the mind turning around within the 8th consciousness, so that the ''ālayavijñāna'', also known as the ''tathāgatagarbha'', is transformed into the "bright mirror wisdom". The ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'' presents the Chan/Zen Buddhist view of the ''tathāgatagarbha'':
{{quote|[The Buddha said,] Now, Mahāmati, what is perfect knowledge? It is realised when one casts aside the discriminating notions of form, name, reality, and character; it is the inner realisation by noble wisdom. This perfect knowledge, Mahāmati, is the essence of the Tathāgata-garbha.&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, D.T., trans. (1932) ''The Lankavatara Sutra''. London: Routledge &amp; Kegen Paul: p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When this active transformation is complete, the other seven consciousnesses are also transformed. The 7th consciousness of delusive discrimination becomes transformed into the "equality wisdom". The 6th consciousness of thinking sense becomes transformed into the "profound observing wisdom", and the 1st to 5th consciousnesses of the five sensory senses become transformed into the "all-performing wisdom".

The Chan master [[Mazu Daoyi]] (709–788) developed a radical interpretation of buddha nature, famously stating that it was nothing less than ordinary mind and that all beings were already enlightened from the start.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

The influential Chan patriarch [[Guifeng Zongmi]] (780–841) interpreted Buddha nature as “empty tranquil awareness” (''k’ung-chi chih''), which he took from the Ho-tse school of Chan.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Following the Srimala sutra, he interpreted the theory of emptiness as presented in the [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñaparamita]] sutras as provisional and saw buddha nature as the definitive teaching of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

According to Heng-Ching Shih, the teaching of the universal Buddha-nature does not intend to assert the existence of substantial, entity-like self endowed with excellent features of a Buddha. Rather, Buddha-nature simply represents the potentiality to be realized in the future.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;Heng-Ching Shih, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130807082256/http://budsas.org/ebud/ebdha191.htm The Significance Of 'Tathagatagarbha' -- A Positive Expression Of 'Sunyata']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hsing Yun]], forty-eighth patriarch of the [[Linji school]], equates the Buddha-nature with the dharmakāya in line with pronouncements in key tathāgatagarbha sūtras. He defines these two as:
{{quote|the inherent nature that exists in all beings. In Mahāyāna Buddhism, enlightenment is a process of uncovering this inherent nature … The Buddha nature [is] identical with transcendental reality. The unity of the Buddha with everything that exists.&lt;ref&gt;Hsing Yun, Master; tr. by Tom Graham (1999). ''Being Good: Buddhist Ethics for Everyday Life''. New York: Weatherhill: pp. 152-153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BJ010/bj010146307.pdf 現代禪宗心性思想研究的幾點評論]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Korean Buddhism==
In the Korean ''[[Vajrasamadhi-sutra|Vajrasamādhi Sūtra]]'' (685 CE), the tathāgatagarbha is presented as being possessed of two elements, one essential, immutable, changeless and still, the other active and salvational:
{{quote|This "dharma of the one mind", which is the "original tathagatagarbha", is said to be "calm and motionless" ... The ''Vajrasamadhi'''s analysis of tathagatagarbha also recalls a distinction the Awakening of Faith makes between the calm, unchanging essence of the mind and its active, adaptable function [...] The tathagatagarbha is equated with the "original edge of reality" (''bhutakoti'') that is beyond all distinctions - the equivalent of original enlightenment, or the essence. But tathagatagarbha is also the active functioning of that original enlightenment - 'the inspirational power of that fundamental faculty' .... The tathagatagarbha is thus both the 'original edge of reality' that is beyond cultivation (&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; essence) as well as the specific types of wisdom and mystical talents that are the byproducts of enlightenment (&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; function).&lt;ref&gt;Buswell, Robert E. Jr. (2007). ''Cultivating Original Enlightenment''. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press: p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Japanese Buddhism==

===Nichiren Buddhism===
[[Nichiren]] (1222–1282) was a Buddhist monk who taught devotion to the ''Lotus Sutra'' as the exclusive means to attain enlightenment, and the chanting of [[Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō]] as the essential practice of the teaching. [[Nichiren Buddhism]] includes various schools with diverging interpretations of Nichiren's teachings.

Nichiren Buddhism views the Buddha nature as "The inner potential for attaining Buddhahood", common to all people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=The English Buddhist Dictionary Committee |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism |publisher=Soka Gakkai |year=2002 |location=Tōkyō |pages= |url=http://www.sgilibrary.org/dict.html |doi= |id= |isbn=978-4-412-01205-9 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530075716/http://www.sgilibrary.org/dict.html |archivedate=May 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on the ''Lotus Sutra'', Nichiren maintained that "all living being possess the Buddha nature",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=584&amp;m=3&amp;q=all%20living%20beings%20possess%20the%20Buddha%20nature. All Living Beings Possess Buddha Nature]&lt;/ref&gt; being the inherent potential to attain Buddhahood: "The Buddha nature refers to the potential for attaining Buddhahood, a state of awakening filled with compassion and wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sokaspirit.org/study/new-light/buddhism-in-new-light-chapter-17-freeing-the-caged-bird-within?set_language=es Freeing the caged bird within] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729152739/http://www.sokaspirit.org/study/new-light/buddhism-in-new-light-chapter-17-freeing-the-caged-bird-within?set_language=es |date=July 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emphasis in Nichiren Buddhism is on "revealing the Buddha nature" - or attaining Buddhahood – in this lifetime &lt;ref&gt;The Gosho Translation Committee: [http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=3 ''The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin, Volume I''], Tokyo: Soka Gakkai, 2006.  {{ISBN|4-412-01024-4}}; pp.3 - 5 (On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime)&lt;/ref&gt; through chanting the name of the Dharma of the Lotus Sutra: "[T]the Buddha nature within us is summoned forth and manifested by our chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=887&amp;m=3&amp;q=When%20we%20revere%20Myoho-renge-kyo%20inherent When we rever Myoho-renge-kyo inherent]&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential for Buddhahood exists in the whole spectrum of the [[Ten spiritual realms|Ten Worlds]] of life, and this means that all people, including evil doers, have Buddha nature,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=923&amp;m=3&amp;q=all the beings Sokai Gakka International: All the beings]&lt;/ref&gt; which remains as a dormant possibility or a theoretical potential in the field of emptiness or non-substantiality until it is materialized in reality through Buddhist practice.

In his letter "Opening the Eyes of Wooden and painted Images" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=85 Opening the Eyes of Wooden and painted Images]&lt;/ref&gt; Nichiren explains that insentient matter (such as trees, mandalas, images, statues) also possess the Buddha nature, because they serve as objects of worship. This view regards the Buddha nature as the original nature of all manifestations of life – sentient and insentient – through their interconnectedness:
{{quote|This concept of the enlightenment of plants in turn derives from the doctrine of three thousand realms in a single moment of life, which teaches that all life—insentient and sentient—possesses the Buddha nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=89&amp;m=3&amp;q=the%20enlightenment%20of%20plants Enlightenment of plants]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Zen Buddhism===
The founder of the [[Sōtō school]] of [[Zen Buddhism]], [[Dōgen Zenji]], held that Buddha-nature (''busshō'' 佛性) was simply the true nature of reality and Being. This true nature was just impermanence, becoming and 'vast emptiness'. Because he saw the whole universe as an expression of Buddha-nature, he held that even grass and trees are Buddha nature. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore, the very impermanency of grass and tree, thicket and forest is the Buddha nature. The very impermanency of men and things, body and mind, is the Buddha nature. Nature and lands, mountains and rivers, are impermanent because they are the Buddha nature. Supreme and complete enlightenment, because it is impermanent, is the Buddha nature.&lt;ref name=Dumoulin&gt;Dumoulin, Heinrich. Zen Buddhism, Volume 2: A History, "Section 2, Dogen" p. 51-119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The founder of [[Sanbō Kyōdan]] lineage of Zen Buddhism, [[Hakuun Yasutani|Yasutani Haku'un Roshi]], also defined Buddha-nature in terms of the emptiness and impermanence of all dharmas:
{{quote|Everything by its very nature is subject to the process of infinite transformation - this is its Buddha- or Dharma-nature. 
What is the substance of this Buddha- or Dharma-nature? In Buddhism it is called ''ku'' (shunyata). Now, ''ku'' is not mere emptiness. It is that which is living, dynamic, devoid of mass, unfixed, beyond individuality or personality--the matrix of all phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Kapleau. ''Three Pillars of Zen''. Anchor books, Doubleday. p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A famous reference to Buddha-nature in the Zen-tradition is the [[Mu (negative)|Mu-koan]]:
{{quote|A monk asked [[Zhaozhou Congshen]], a Chinese Zen master (known as ''Jōshū'' in Japanese), "Has a dog Buddha-nature or not?" Zhaozhou answered, "It does not."

The founder of the [[Jōdo Shinshū]] of [[Pure Land Buddhism]], [[Shinran]], equated Buddha-Nature with [[shinjin]].&lt;ref&gt;The Collected Works of Shinran, 1997, Jodo Shinshu Hongwanji-ha&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tibetan Buddhism==
{{Main|Rangtong|Shentong}}
In [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] scholastics, there are two main camps of interpreting buddha nature. There are those who argue that ''tathāgatagarbha'' is just emptiness (described either as [[dharmadhatu]], the nature of phenomena, or a nonimplicative negation) and there are those who see it as the union of the mind's emptiness and luminosity (which includes the buddha qualities).&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gelug]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] favors what is called the ''[[Rangtong-Shentong|rangtong]]'' interpretation of [[Prasaṅgika]] Madhyamaka philosophy.{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=107-108}} They thus interpret Buddha nature as an expedient term for the emptiness of inherent existence. Other schools, especially the [[Jonang]],{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=107}} and [[Kagyu]] have tended to accept the [[shentong]], "other-empty", Madhyamaka philosophy, which discerns an Absolute which "is empty of adventitious defilements which are intrinsically other than it, but is not empty of its own inherent existence".{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=108}}

These interpretations of the tathagatagarbha-teachings has been a matter of intensive debates in Tibet.{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=105-109}}

===Gelug===
An early Tibetan translator, [[Ngok Loden Sherab|Ngok Lotsawa]] (1050-1109) argues in his commentary to the Uttaratantra that Buddha nature is a non-implicative negation, which is to say that it is emptiness, as a ''total negation'' of inherent existence (''svabhava'') that does not imply that anything is left un-negated (in terms of its ''svabhava''). Another early figure, Chaba Chokyi Senge also argued that Buddha nature was a non-implicative negation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)|Kadampa]] tradition generally followed [[Ngok Loden Sherab|Ngok Lotsawa]] by holding that Buddha nature was a nonimplicative negation. The [[Gelug]] school, which sees itself as a continuation of the Kadampas, also hold this view, while also holding, as Chaba did, that Buddha nature teachings are of expedient meaning.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

[[Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, 1st Panchen Lama|Kedrub Jé Geleg Balsang]] (1385-1438), one of the main disciples of Tsongkhapa, defined the tathāgatagarbha thus:&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is the emptiness of mind’s being empty of being really established that is called “the naturally pure true nature of the mind.” The naturally pure true nature of the mind in its phase of not being free from adventitious stains is called “sugata heart” or “naturally abiding disposition."&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Brunnholzl states that the view of [[Gyaltsab Je|Gyaltsab Darma Rinchen]] (1364-1432) is "that the tathàgata heart is the state of a being in whom mind's emptiness is obscured, while buddhas by definition do not possess this tathàgata heart."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The [[14th Dalai Lama]] sees the Buddha-nature as the "original clear light of mind", but points out that it ultimately does not exist independently, because, like all other phenomena, it is of the nature of emptiness:
{{quote|Once one pronounces the words "emptiness" and "absolute", one has the impression of speaking of the same thing, in fact of the absolute. If emptiness must be explained through the use of just one of these two terms, there will be confusion. I must say this; otherwise you might think that the innate original clear light as absolute truth really exists.&lt;ref&gt;Dalai Lama, the (1999). ''Buddha Heart, Buddha Mind''. New York: Crossroad: p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Sakya ===
[[Sakya Pandita]] (1182-1251) sees the buddha nature as the [[dharmadhatu]] free from all reference points, and states that the teaching that buddha nature exists in all beings is of expedient meaning and that its basis is emptiness, citing [[Chandrakirti|Candrakirti]]'s ''Madhyamakāvatārabhāsya''.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sakya scholar Rongtön meanwhile, argued that buddha nature is [[Tathātā|suchness]], with stains, or [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] of the mind with stains.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakya scholar [[Buton Rinchen Drub]] (1290–1364), like the Gelugpas, held that the Buddha nature teachings were of expedient meaning and that that the naturally abiding disposition is nothing but emptiness, however unlike them, his view was that the basis for these teachings is the alaya-vijñana and also that buddha nature is the dharmakaya of a buddha but "never exists in the great mass of sentient beings".&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2014, page 68"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Brunnholzl, in the works of the influential Sakya scholar [[Gorampa|Gorampa Sonam Senge]] (1429-1489), buddha nature is &lt;blockquote&gt;"nondual unity of minds lucidity and emptiness or awareness and emptiness free from all reference points. It is not mere emptiness because sheer emptiness cannot be the basis of both samsára and nirvána. However, it is not mere lucidity either because this lucidity is a conditioned entity and the tathágata heart is unconditioned."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Sakya Chokden]] meanwhile argues that the ultimate buddha nature is "minds natural luminosity free from all extremes of reference points, which is the sphere of personally experienced wisdom and an implicative negation."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jonang===
The [[Jonang]] school, whose foremost historical figure was the Tibetan scholar-monk [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen]] (1292–1361), sees the Buddha-nature as the very ground of the Buddha himself, as the "permanent indwelling of the Buddha in the basal state".&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Jeffrey, trans. (2006). ''Mountain Doctrine: Tibet's Fundamental Treatise on Other-Emptiness and the Buddha-Matrix.'' NY: Snow Lion: p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brunnholzl, Dolpopa, basing himself on certain ''tathāgatagarbha'' sutras, argued that the buddha nature is "ultimately really established, everlasting, eternal, permanent, immutable (therzug), and being beyond dependent origination."&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2014, page 68"/&gt; This is the foundation of what is called the [[Rangtong-Shentong|Shentong]] view.

Moreover, the Buddhist tantric scripture entitled ''Chanting the Names of Mañjuśrī ({{IAST|Mañjuśrī-nāma-saṅgīti}})'', repeatedly exalts, as portrayed by Dolpopa, not the non-Self but the Self, and applies the following terms to this ultimate reality : 'The Buddha-Self, the beginningless Self, the solid Self, the diamond Self'. These terms are applied in a manner which reflects the cataphatic approach to Buddhism, typical of much of Dolpopa's writings.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hopkins, Jeffrey, trans. (2006). ''Mountain Doctrine: Tibet's Fundamental Treatise on Other-Emptiness and the Buddha-Matrix.'' NY: Snow Lion: pp.279-280&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Cyrus Stearns writes that Dolpopa's attitude to the 'third turning of the wheel' doctrines (i.e. the Buddha-nature teachings) is that they "are the final definitive statements on the nature of ultimate reality, the primordial ground or substratum beyond the chain of dependent origination, and which is only empty of other, relative phenomena."&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Cyrus Stearns, ''The Buddha from Dolpo: A Study of the Life and Thought of the Tibetan Master Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen'', State University of New York Press, Albany, 1999, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nyingma===
In the [[Nyingma]] school doctrines on buddha nature are generally marked by the tendency to align the idea with [[Dzogchen]] views as well as with [[Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction|Prasangika]] [[Madhyamaka]], beginning with the work of [[Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo|Rongzom]] (1042-1136) and continuing into the work of [[Longchenpa]] (1308-1364) and [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham (1846- 1912)]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham Rinpoche]], the most authoritative figure in modern Nyingma, adopted a view of buddha nature as the unity of appearance and emptiness, relating it to the descriptions of the Ground in Dzogchen as outlined by Longchenpa. This ground is said to be primordially pure (ka dag) and spontaneously present (Ihun grub).&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Germano writes that Dzogchen "represents the most sophisticated interpretation of the so-called "Buddha nature" tradition within the context of Indo-Tibetan thought".&lt;ref&gt;Germano, David Francis (1992). [https://web.archive.org/web/20120301185505/http://vajrayana.faithweb.com/Poetic%20thought%20-%20The%20Tantric%20synthesis%20of%20Dzogs%20Chen.pdf ''Poetic thought, the intelligent Universe, and the mystery of self: The Tantric synthesis of'' rDzogs Chen ''in fourteenth century Tibet''], The University of Wisconsin, Madison. Doctoral thesis. pp.viii - ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th/20th-century Nyingma scholar, Shechen Gyaltsap Gyurme Pema Namgyal, sees the Buddha nature as ultimate truth,&lt;ref&gt;Rabjam, Shechen (2007). ''The Great Medicine: Steps in Meditation on the Enlightened Mind''. Boston: Shambhala: p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; nirvana, which is constituted of profundity, primordial peace and radiance:

{{quote|Buddha-nature is immaculate. It is profound, serene, unfabricated suchness, an uncompounded expanse of luminosity; nonarising, unceasing, primordial peace, spontaneously present nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;Rabjam, Shechen (2007). ''The Great Medicine: Steps in Meditation on the Enlightened Mind''. Boston: Shambhala: p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche]] sees an identity between the Buddha-nature, [[Dharmadhatu|dharmadhātu]] (essence of all phenomena and the noumenon) and the [[Three Vajras]], saying:
{{quote|Dharmadhatu is adorned with dharmakaya, which is endowed with dharmadhatu wisdom. This is a brief but very profound statement, because "dharmadhatu" also refers to sugata-garbha or buddha nature. Buddha nature is all-encompassing ... This buddha nature is present just as the shining sun is present in the sky. It is indivisible from the three vajras [i.e. the Buddha's Body, Speech and Mind] of the awakened state, which do not perish or change.&lt;ref&gt;Urgyen Rinpoche, Tulku (1999). ''As It Is''. Hong Kong: Rangjung Yeshe Books: p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The Nyingma meditation masters, [[Palden Sherab|Khenchen Palden Sherab]] and Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal, emphasise that the essential nature of the mind (the Buddha-nature) is not a blankness, but is characterized by wonderful qualities and a non-conceptual perfection that is already present and complete, it's just obscured and we fail to recognize it.&lt;ref&gt;Sherab, Khenchen Palden and Dongyal, Khenpo Tsewang (2006). ''Opening to Our Primordial Nature''. New York: Snow Lion: pp. 3, 9, 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in the context of Nyingma, [[Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche|Dzogchen Ponlop]] expresses the view that there exists within vajrayana Buddhism the doctrine that we are already buddha: ‘... in the vajrayana, we are buddha ''right now'', in this very moment’&lt;ref&gt;Dzogchen Ponlop, Mind Beyond Death, Snow Lion publications, New York, 2006, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is legitimate to have ‘vajra pride’ in our buddha mind and the already present qualities of enlightenment with which it is replete:
{{quote|Vajra pride refers to our pride and confidence in the absolute nature of our mind as buddha: primordially, originally pure, awake and full of the qualities of enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Dzogchen Ponlop, ''Mind Beyond Death'', Snow Lion Publications, New York, 2006, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Kagyu====
According to Brunnholzl,&lt;blockquote&gt;Virtually all [[Kagyu]] masters hold the teaching on buddha nature to be of definitive meaning and deny that the tathagata heart is just sheer emptiness or a nonimplicative negation. Though the Kagyu approach has certain similarities with Dolpopa's view, it is generally less absolute than the latter's and shows several significant differences, such as not claiming that the buddha qualities exist in their full-blown form even in confused sentient beings and not making such an absolute distinction between the two realities as Dolpopa does (the exception is [[Jamgon Kongtrul|Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Taye]], who largely follows [[Taranatha]] and Dolpopa but at times blends their positions with the [[Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama|Third Karmapa's]] view).&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2014, page 68"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In Kagyu the view of the Third Karmapa is generally seen as the most authoritative. This is the view that buddha nature is "mind's luminous ultimate nature or nondual wisdom, which is the basis of everything in samsara and nirvana."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 72.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Thrangu Rinpoche]] sees the Buddha nature as the indivisible oneness of wisdom and emptiness:
{{quote|The union of wisdom and emptiness is the essence of Buddha-hood or what is called Buddha-nature (Skt. ''Tathagata-garbha'') because it contains the very seed, the potential of Buddhahood. It resides in each and every being and because of this essential nature, this heart nature, there is the possibility of reaching Buddhahood.&lt;ref&gt;Thrangu Rinpoche, Khenchen. [http://www.simhas.org/teaching14.html ''Buddha Nature and Buddhahood: the Mahayana and Tantra Yana''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230142513/http://www.simhas.org/teaching14.html |date=December 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The Rimé movement===
The Rimé movement is an ecumenical movement in Tibet which started as an attempt to reconcile the various Tibetan schools in the 19th century. In contrast to the Gelugpa, which adheres to the ''rang stong'', "self-empty", or Prasaṅgika point of view,{{refn|Which states that all existences are empty of a "self-nature"}} the Rimé movement supports ''shen tong'' (''gzhan tong''), "other-empty", an essential nature which is "pure radiant non-dual consciousness".{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=107}} [[Jamgon Kongtrul]] says about the two systems:{{quote|Madhyamika philosophies have no differences in realising as 'Shunyata', all phenomena that we experience on a relative level. They have no differences also, in reaching the meditative state where all extremes (ideas) completely dissolve. Their difference lies in the words they use to describe the [[Dharmata]]. Shentong describes the Dharmata, the mind of Buddha, as 'ultimately real'; while Rangtong philosophers fear that if it is described that way, people might understand it as the concept of 'soul' or 'Atma'. The Shentong philosopher believes that there is a more serious possibility of misunderstanding in describing the Enlightened State as 'unreal' and 'void'. Kongtrul finds the Rangtong way of presentation the best to dissolve concepts and the Shentong way the best to describe the experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/A%20-%20Tibetan%20Buddhism/Authors/Ringu%20Tulku/The%20Rime%20Movement/THE%20RIME%20(%20Ris-med%20)%20MOVEMENT.htm Ringu Tulku: The Rimé (Ris-med) movement of Jamgon Kongtrul the Great]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Modern scholarship==
Modern scholarship points to the various possible interpretations of Buddha Nature as either an essential self, as [[Sunyata]], or as the ''inherent possibility'' of awakening.

===Essential self===
Shenpen Hookham, Oxford Buddhist scholar and Tibetan lama of the Shentong tradition writes of the Buddha-nature or "true self" as something real and permanent, and already present within the being as uncompounded enlightenment. She calls it "the Buddha within", and comments:
{{quote|In scriptural terms, there can be no real objection to referring to Buddha, Buddhajnana [Buddha Awareness/ Buddha Knowledge], Nirvana and so forth as the True Self, unless the concept of Buddha and so forth being propounded can be shown to be impermanent, suffering, compounded, or imperfect in some way ... in Shentong terms, the non-self is about what is ''not'' the case, and the Self of the Third Dharmachakra [i.e. the Buddha-nature doctrine] is about what truly IS.&lt;ref&gt;Hookham, Shenpen (1991). ''The Buddha Within''. State University of New York Press: p.&amp;nbsp;104, p.&amp;nbsp;353&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Buddhist scholar and chronicler, Merv Fowler, writes that the Buddha-nature really is present as an essence within each being. Fowler comments:
{{quote|The teaching that Buddha-nature is the hidden essence within all sentient beings is the main message of the ''tathagatagarbha'' literature, the earliest of which is the ''Tathagatagarbha Sutra''. This short sutra says that all living beings are in essence identical to the Buddha regardless of their defilements or their continuing transmigration from life to life... As in the earlier traditions, there is present the idea that enlightenment, or nirvana, is not something which has to be achieved, it is something which is already there... In a way, it means that everyone is really a Buddha ''now''.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Merv (1999). ''Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices''. Sussex Academic Press: pp.&amp;nbsp;100–101&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Sunyata===
According to Heng-Ching Shih, the ''tathāgatagarbha''/Buddha-nature does not represent a substantial self (''ātman''). Rather, it is a positive language expression of emptiness (''śūnyatā''), which emphasizes the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices. The intention of the teaching of ''tathāgatagarbha''/Buddha nature is soteriological rather than theoretical.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

[[Paul Williams (British professor)|Paul Williams]] puts forward the Madhyamaka interpretation of the Buddha-nature as emptiness in the following terms:
{{quote|… if one is a Madhyamika then that which enables sentient beings to become buddhas must be the very factor that enables the minds of sentient beings to change into the minds of Buddhas. That which enables things to change is their simple absence of inherent existence, their emptiness. Thus the tathagatagarbha becomes emptiness itself, but specifically emptiness when applied to the mental continuum.{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=164-165}}}}

===Critical Buddhist interpretation===
Several contemporary Japanese Buddhist scholars, headed under the label [[Critical Buddhism]] (''hihan bukky''ō, 批仏教), have been critical of Buddha-nature thought. According to Matsumoto Shiro and Hakamaya Noriaki of [[Komazawa University]], essentialist conceptions of Buddha-nature are at odds with the fundamental Buddhist doctrine of [[dependent origination]] and non-self ([[Anatta|''anātman'']]'')''.&lt;ref&gt;Matsumoto Shirõ (1997). ''The Doctrine of Tathagata-garbha Is Not Buddhist. In: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press 1997''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hakamaya Noriaki (1997). ''Critical Philosophy Versus Topical Philosophy'', in: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha nature doctrines which they label as ''dhātuvāda'' (“substantialism,”sometimes rendered “locus theory” or “topicalism”) and “generative monism” is not Buddhism at all.&lt;ref&gt;Sharf, Robert H. Buddha-nature, Critical Buddhism,and Early Chan, 불교학리뷰 (Critical Review for Buddhist Studies) 22권 (2017. 12) 105p~150p.&lt;/ref&gt; As defined by Matsumoto, this "locus" theory or ''dhātuvāda'' which he rejects as un-buddhist is:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the theory that the single (''eka, sama'') existent “locus” (''dhatu'') or basis is the cause that produces the manifold phenomena or “super-loci” (''dharmah'').&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Shiro Matsumoto, Critiques of Tathagatagarbha Thought and Critical Buddhism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Matsumoto further argues that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Tathagatagarbha thought was a Buddhist version of [[Advaita Vedanta|Hindu monism]], formed by the influence of [[Hinduism]] gradually introduced into Buddhism, especially after the rise of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other Japanese scholars responded to this view leading to a lively debate in Japan. Takasaki Jikido, a well known authority on ''tathagathagarbha'' thought, accepted that Buddha nature theories are similar to Upanishadic theories and that ''dhātuvāda'' is an accurate expression of the structure of these doctrines'','' but argues that the Buddha nature texts are aware of this and that Buddha nature is not necessarily un-Buddhist or anti-Buddhist.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Swanson, Paul L. Why They Say Zen is Not Buddhism: Recent Japanese Critiques of Buddha-Nature. http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/CriticalZen/What_and_why_of_Critical_Buddhism_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Likewise, Hirakawa Akira, sees Buddha nature as the potential to attain Buddhahood which not static but ever changing and argues that "''dhātu''" does not necessarily mean substratum (he points to some [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agamas]] which identify ''dhatu'' with [[Pratītyasamutpāda|''pratitya-samutpada'']]).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Western scholars have reacted in different ways to this idea. Sallie B. King objects to their view, seeing the Buddha-nature as a metaphor for the potential in all beings to attain Buddhahood, rather than as an ontological reality.&lt;ref name="nanzan-u.ac.jp2"&gt;Sallie B. King (1997), ''The Doctrine of Buddha Nature is Impeccably Buddhist''. In: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press 1997, pp. 174-179. {{ISBN|0824819497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert H. Sharf notes that the worries of the Critical Buddhists is nothing new, for "the early ''tathāgatagarbha'' scriptures betray a similar anxiety, as they tacitly acknowledge that the doctrine is close to, if not identical with, the heretical ātmavāda teachings of the non- Buddhists."&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Sharf, Robert H. Buddha-nature, Critical Buddhism,and Early Chan, 불교학리뷰 (Critical Review for Buddhist Studies) 22권 (2017. 12) 105p~150p. http://www.academia.edu/27749171/Buddha-nature_Critical_Buddhism_and_Early_Chan&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes how the [[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra|''Nirvāṇa-sūtra'']] "tacitly concedes the non-Buddhist roots of the ''tathāgatagarbha'' idea."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Sharf also has pointed out how certain Southern Chan masters were concerned with other interpretations of Buddha nature, showing how the tendency to critique certain views of Buddha nature is not new in East Asian Buddhism.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Peter N. Gregory has also argued that at least some East Asian interpretations of Buddha nature are equivalent to what Critical Buddhists call ''dhātuvāda,'' especially the work of [[Guifeng Zongmi|Tsung-mi]], who "emphasizes the underlying ontological ground on which all phenomenal appearances (''hsiang'') are based, which he variously refers to as the nature (''hsing''), the one mind (''i-hsin'')...".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Peter N. Is Critical Buddhism Really Critical? in ''Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism'' https://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/CriticalZen/Critical_Buddhism_Gregory.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dan Lusthaus]], certain [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhist]] ideologies which became dominant in the 8th century promoted the idea of an "underlying metaphysical substratum" or "underlying, invariant, universal metaphysical 'source'" and thus do seem to be a kind of ''dhātuvāda.'' According to Lusthaus "in early T’ang China (7th–8th century) there was a deliberate attempt to divorce Chinese Buddhism from developments in India." Lusthaus notes that the Huayen thinker [[Fazang|Fa-tsang]] was influential in this theological trend who promoted the idea that true Buddhism was about comprehending the "One Mind that alone is the ground of reality" (''wei- hsin).''&lt;ref&gt;Lusthaus, Dan, Critical Buddhism and Returning to the Sources&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Williams too has criticised this view, saying that Critical Buddhism is too narrow in its definition of what constitutes Buddhism. According to Williams, "We should abandon any simplistic identification of Buddhism with a straightforward not-Self definition".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams, ''Mahayana Buddhism'', Routledge, London, 2nd Edition, 2009, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple meanings===
Sutton agrees with Williams' critique on the narrowness of any single interpretation. In discussing the inadequacy of modern scholarship on Buddha-nature, Sutton states, 
{{quote|One is impressed by the fact that these authors, as a rule, tend to opt for a single meaning disregarding all other possible meanings which are embraced in turn by other texts".&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Florin Giripescu (1991). ''Existence and Enlightenment in the Laṅkāvatāra-sūtra''. SUNY ({{ISBN|0-7914-0172-3}}): p.51&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He goes on to point out that the term ''tathāgatagarbha'' has up to six possible connotations. Of these, he says the three most important are:
#an underlying ontological reality or essential nature (''tathāgata-tathatā-'vyatireka'') which is functionally equivalent to a ''self'' (''ātman'') in an ''[[Upanishad]]ic'' sense,
#the ''dharma-kāya'' which penetrates all beings (''sarva-sattveṣu dharma-kāya-parispharaṇa''), which is functionally equivalent to [[brahman]] in an ''Upanishadic'' sense
#the womb or matrix of Buddhahood existing in all beings ''(tathāgata-gotra-saṃbhava''), which provides beings with the possibility of awakening.&lt;ref&gt;Takasaki, Jikido (1991). ''A Study on the Ratnagotravibhāga''. ISMEO 1966: p.198&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Florin Giripescu Sutton, ''Existence and Enlightenment in the Laṅkāvatāra-sūtra'', SUNY({{ISBN|0-7914-0172-3}}): p.53&lt;/ref&gt;
Of these three, Sutton claims that only the third connotation has any soteriological significance, while the other two posit Buddha-nature as an ontological reality and essential nature behind all phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Wayman, Alex (1981). The Title and Textual Affiliation of the Guhya-garbha Tantra. In: ''From Mahayana Buddhism to Tantra — Felicitation Volume for Dr Shunkyo Matsumata''. Tokyo: p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and significance==
{{Life timeline}}
{{main|Evolutionary history of life}}
The seemingly rapid appearance of fossils in the "Primordial Strata" was noted by [[William Buckland]] in the 1840s,&lt;ref name="Buckland1841"&gt;{{cite book| author=Buckland, W. |authorlink=William Buckland| year=1841| title=Geology and Mineralogy Considered with Reference to Natural Theology| publisher=Lea &amp; Blanchard| isbn=1-147-86894-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] discussed the then inexplicable lack of earlier fossils as one of the main difficulties for his theory of descent with slow modification through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="OriginOfSpecies"&gt;{{cite book| title=On the Origin of Species by Natural Selection| author=Darwin, C| authorlink=Charles Darwin| year=1859| pages=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=324&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 202, 306–308]| publisher=Murray| location=London| isbn=1-60206-144-0| oclc=176630493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long-running puzzlement about the appearance of the Cambrian [[fauna]], seemingly abruptly, without precursor, centers on three key points: whether there really was a mass diversification of complex organisms over a relatively short period of time during the early Cambrian; what might have caused such rapid change; and what it would imply about the origin of animal life. Interpretation is difficult due to a limited supply of evidence, based mainly on an incomplete fossil record and chemical signatures remaining in Cambrian rocks.

The first discovered Cambrian fossils were [[trilobites]], described by [[Edward Lhuyd]], the curator of [[Oxford Museum]], in 1698.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liñán |first1=E.|last2=Gonzalo |first2=R|editor1-last=Rábano |editor1-first=I.|editor2-last=Gozalo|editor2-first=R.|editor3-last=García-Bellido |editor3-first=D.|title=Advances in Trilobite Research|year=2008|publisher=Instituto Geológico y Minero de España |location=Madrid |isbn=978-84-7840-759-0 |page=240 |chapter=Cryptopalaeontology: Magical descriptions of trilobites about two thousand years before scientific references}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although their evolutionary importance was not known, on the basis of their old age, William Buckland (1784–1856) realised that a dramatic step-change in the fossil record had occurred around the base of what we now call the Cambrian.&lt;ref name="Buckland1841"/&gt; Nineteenth-century geologists such as [[Adam Sedgwick]] and [[Roderick Murchison]] used the fossils for dating rock strata, specifically for establishing the [[Cambrian]] and [[Silurian]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=Mark |title=Fossil Focus: Trilobites |journal=Palaeontology Online |year=2013 |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=1–9 |url=http://www.palaeontologyonline.com/articles/2013/fossil-focus-trilobites/}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1859, leading geologists including Roderick Murchison, were convinced that what was then called the lowest Silurian stratum showed the origin of life on Earth, though others, including [[Charles Lyell]], differed. In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] considered this sudden appearance of a solitary group of trilobites, with no apparent antecedents, and absence of other fossils, to be "undoubtedly of the gravest nature" among the difficulties in his theory of natural selection. He reasoned that earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but that their fossils had not been found due to the imperfections of the fossil record.&lt;ref name="OriginOfSpecies"/&gt; In the sixth edition of his book, he stressed his problem further as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Darwin |first1=Charles R. |title=The origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection |date=1876 |page=286 |edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|To the question why we do not find rich fossiliferous deposits belonging to these assumed earliest periods prior to the Cambrian system, I can give no satisfactory answer.}}

American paleontologist [[Charles Doolittle Walcott|Charles Walcott]], who studied the [[Fossils of the Burgess Shale|Burgess Shale fauna]], proposed that an interval of time, the "Lipalian", was not represented in the fossil record or did not preserve fossils, and that the ancestors of the Cambrian animals evolved during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Charles Doolittle Walcott | title=Cambrian Geology and Paleontology |journal=Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections |volume=57 |page=14 |author=Walcott, C.D. |year=1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier fossil evidence has since been found. The earliest claim is that the history of life on earth goes back {{Ma|3850|million years}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Heinrich D. Holland |title=Evidence for life on earth more than 3850 million years ago |journal=Science |author=Holland, Heinrich D |date= January 3, 1997 |doi=10.1126/science.275.5296.38 |volume=275 |pmid=11536783 |issue=5296 |pages=38–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocks of that age at [[Warrawoona, Australia]], were claimed to contain fossil [[stromatolite]]s, stubby pillars formed by colonies of [[microorganism]]s. Fossils (''[[Grypania]]'') of more complex [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells, from which all animals, plants, and fungi are built, have been found in rocks from {{Ma|1400}}, in [[China]] and [[Montana]]. Rocks dating from {{Ma|580|543}} contain fossils of the [[Ediacara biota]], organisms so large that they are likely multicelled, but very unlike any modern organism.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife" /&gt; In 1948, [[Preston Cloud]] argued that a period of "eruptive" evolution occurred in the Early Cambrian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Cloud, P.E. | year=1948 |title=Some problems and patterns of evolution exemplified by fossil invertebrates | journal=Evolution | volume=2 | issue=4 | pages=322–350 | doi=10.2307/2405523 | pmid=18122310 | jstor=2405523 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but as recently as the 1970s, no sign was seen of how the 'relatively' modern-looking organisms of the Middle and Late [[Cambrian]] arose.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife" /&gt;

[[File:Opabinia BW2.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Opabinia]]'' made the largest single contribution to modern interest in the Cambrian explosion.]]

The intense modern interest in this "Cambrian explosion" was sparked by the work of [[Harry B. Whittington]] and colleagues, who, in the 1970s, reanalysed many fossils from the Burgess Shale and concluded that several were as complex as, but different from, any living animals.&lt;ref name="Whittington1979Lawn"&gt;Whittington, H. B. (1979). Early arthropods, their appendages and relationships. In M. R. House (Ed.), The origin of major invertebrate groups (pp. 253–268). The Systematics Association Special Volume, 12. London: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whittington1985BurgessShale"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Burgess Shale | author=Whittington, H.B. | authorlink=Harry B. Whittington |author2=Geological Survey of Canada | year=1985 | publisher=Yale University Press | isbn=0-660-11901-3 | oclc=15630217 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common organism, ''[[Marrella]]'', was clearly an [[arthropod]], but not a member of any known arthropod [[class (biology)|class]]. Organisms such as the five-eyed ''[[Opabinia]]'' and spiny slug-like ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' were so different from anything else known that Whittington's team assumed they must represent different phyla, seemingly unrelated to anything known today.

While differing significantly in details, both Whittington and Gould proposed that all modern animal phyla had appeared almost simultaneously in a rather short span of geological period. This view led to the modernization of Darwin's tree of life and the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which [[Niles Eldredge|Eldredge]] and Gould developed in the early 1970s and which views evolution as long intervals of near-stasis "punctuated" by short periods of rapid change.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2004EarlySkeletalFossils"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | chapter=Early skeletal fossils

Other analyses, some more recent and some dating back to the 1970s, argue that complex animals similar to modern types evolved well before the start of the Cambrian.&lt;ref name="McNamara1996DatingOriginAnimals" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AwramikStromatoliteDiversityMetazoanAppearance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FedonkinWaggoner1997KimberellaMollusc"/&gt;

===Dating the Cambrian===
[[radiometric dating|Radiometric]] dates for much of the Cambrian, obtained by analysis of radioactive elements contained within rocks, have only recently become available, and for only a few regions.

Relative dating (''A'' was before ''B'') is often assumed sufficient for studying processes of evolution, but this, too, has been difficult, because of the problems involved in matching up rocks of the same age across different [[continent]]s.&lt;ref name="DatingProblems"&gt;e.g. {{Cite journal| last = Gehling| first = James| last2 = Jensen| first2 = Sören| last3 = Droser| first3 = Mary

Therefore, dates or descriptions of sequences of events should be regarded with some caution until better data become available.

===Body fossils===
Fossils of organisms' bodies are usually the most informative type of evidence. Fossilization is a rare event, and most fossils are destroyed by [[erosion]] or [[metamorphism]] before they can be observed. Hence, the fossil record is very incomplete, increasingly so as earlier times are considered. Despite this, they are often adequate to illustrate the broader patterns of life's history.&lt;ref name="BentonQualityFossilRecord"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Benton MJ |author2=Wills MA |author3=Hitchin R |title=Quality of the fossil record through time |journal=Nature |volume=403 |issue=6769 |pages=534–7 |year=2000 |pmid=10676959 |doi=10.1038/35000558|bibcode = 2000Natur.403..534B }}

&lt;/ref&gt; Also, biases exist in the fossil record: different environments are more favourable to the preservation of different types of organism or parts of organisms.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2003ExceptionalFossilPreservation"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Butterfield, N.J. | year =2003 | title = Exceptional Fossil Preservation and the Cambrian Explosion | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 166–177 | doi = 10.1093/icb/43.1.166 | url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/43/1/166 | access-date=2008-06-28 | pmid=21680421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, only the parts of organisms that were already [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralised]] are usually preserved, such as the shells of [[Mollusca|molluscs]]. Since most animal species are soft-bodied, they decay before they can become fossilised. As a result, although 30-plus phyla of living animals are known, two-thirds have never been found as fossils.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"&gt;{{cite book | author=Cowen, R. | title=History of Life | publisher=Blackwell Science | isbn=1-4051-1756-7| year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marrella (fossil).png|thumb| This ''[[Marrella]]'' specimen illustrates how clear and detailed the fossils from the [[Burgess Shale]] [[Lagerstätte]] are.]]
The Cambrian fossil record includes an unusually high number of [[lagerstätte]]n, which preserve soft tissues. These allow [[Paleontology|paleontologists]] to examine the internal anatomy of animals, which in other sediments are only represented by shells, spines, claws, etc.&amp;nbsp;– if they are preserved at all. The most significant Cambrian lagerstätten are the early Cambrian [[Maotianshan shale]] beds of Chengjiang ([[Yunnan]], [[China]]) and [[Sirius Passet]] ([[Greenland]]);&lt;ref name="ConwayMorris1979"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the late Cambrian [[Orsten]] ([[Sweden]]) fossil beds.

While lagerstätten preserve far more than the conventional fossil record, they are far from complete. Because lagerstätten are restricted to a narrow range of environments (where soft-bodied organisms can be preserved very quickly, e.g. by mudslides), most animals are probably not represented; further, the exceptional conditions that create lagerstätten probably do not represent normal living conditions.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001"/&gt; In addition, the known Cambrian lagerstätten are rare and difficult to date, while Precambrian lagerstätten have yet to be studied in detail.

The sparseness of the fossil record means that organisms usually exist long before they are found in the fossil record&amp;nbsp;– this is known as the [[Signor–Lipps effect]].&lt;ref name="Signor1982"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Signor |first1=P.W. |last2=Lipps|first2=J.H. |chapter=Sampling bias, gradual extinction patterns and catastrophes in the fossil record |editor-last=Silver|editor-first=L.T.|editor2-last=Schulz|editor2-first=P.H. |title=Geological implications of impacts of large asteroids and comets on the earth |id=A 84–25651 10–42|pages=291–296 |publisher=Geological Society of America |year=1982 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=efz87W88HawC&amp;pg=291&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=0813721903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or with a massive warming resulting from the release of [[methane clathrate|methane ice]].&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining"/&gt;
Such changes may reflect a cause of the Cambrian explosion, although they may also have resulted from an increased level of biological activity&amp;nbsp;– a possible result of the explosion.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining"/&gt; Despite these uncertainties, the geochemical evidence helps by making scientists focus on theories that are consistent with at least one of the likely environmental changes.

===Phylogenetic techniques===
[[Cladistics]] is a technique for working out the "family tree" of a set of organisms. It works by the logic that, if groups B and C have more similarities to each other than either has to group A, then B and C are more closely related to each other than either is to A. Characteristics that are compared may be [[Anatomy|anatomical]], such as the presence of a [[notochord]], or [[Molecular phylogeny|molecular]], by comparing sequences of [[DNA]] or [[protein]]. The result of a successful analysis is a hierarchy of [[clade]]s&amp;nbsp;– groups whose members are believed to share a common ancestor. The cladistic technique is sometimes problematic, as some features, such as wings or [[Evolution of the eye|camera eyes]], evolved more than once, [[convergent evolution|convergently]]&amp;nbsp;– this must be taken into account in analyses.

From the relationships, it may be possible to constrain the date that lineages first appeared. For instance, if fossils of B or C date to X&amp;nbsp;million years ago and the calculated "family tree" says A was an ancestor of B and C, then A must have evolved more than X&amp;nbsp;million years ago.

It is also possible to estimate how long ago two living clades diverged&amp;nbsp;– i.e. about how long ago their last common ancestor must have lived &amp;nbsp;– by assuming that DNA [[mutation]]s accumulate at a constant rate. These "[[molecular clock]]s", however, are fallible, and provide only a very approximate timing: they are not sufficiently precise and reliable for estimating when the groups that feature in the Cambrian explosion first evolved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Phylum===
A [[phylum]] is the highest level in the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean system for classifying organisms]]. Phyla can be thought of as groupings of animals based on general body plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Valentine
| first = James W. | year = 2004 | title = On the Origin of Phyla | publisher = University Of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | isbn = 0-226-84548-6 | page = 7
}}"&lt;cite&gt;Classifications of organisms in hierarchical systems were in use by the 17th and 18th centuries. Usually, organisms were grouped according to their morphological similarities as perceived by those early workers, and those groups were then grouped according to their similarities, and so on, to form a hierarchy.&lt;/cite&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the seemingly different external appearances of organisms, they are classified into phyla based on their internal and developmental organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| title = In the blink of an eye: How vision kick-started the big bang of evolution

| pages = 1–4
}}"&lt;cite&gt;Evolutionary biologists often make sense of the conflicting diversity of form&amp;nbsp;– not always does a relationship between internal and external parts. Early in the history of the subject, it became obvious that internal organisations were generally more important to the higher classification of animals than are external shapes. The internal organisation puts general restrictions on how an animal can exchange gases, obtain nutrients, and reproduce.&lt;/cite&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt; For example, despite their obvious differences, [[spider]]s and [[barnacle]]s both belong to the phylum Arthropoda, but [[earthworm]]s and [[tapeworm]]s, although similar in shape, belong to different phyla.  As chemical and genetic testing becomes more accurate, previously hypothesised phyla are often entirely reworked.

A phylum is not a fundamental division of nature, such as the difference between [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s. It is simply a very high-level grouping in a [[Linnaean taxonomy|classification system]] created to describe all currently living organisms. This system is imperfect, even for modern animals: different books quote different numbers of phyla, mainly because they disagree about the classification of a huge number of worm-like species. As it is based on living organisms, it accommodates extinct organisms poorly, if at all.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jefferies1979OriginOfChordates"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Jefferies, R.P.S. | year=1979 | title=The origin of chordates&amp;nbsp;– a methodological essay | editor=House, M.R. | series=The origin of major invertebrate groups | pages=443–477 | publisher=Academic Press | location=London }} summarised in {{cite journal | author=Budd, G.E. | title=The Cambrian Fossil Record and the Origin of the Phyla | journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume=43 | issue=1 | pages=157–165 | doi=10.1093/icb/43.1.157 | url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/43/1/157 | year=2003 | pmid=21680420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stem group===
The concept of [[stem group]]s was introduced to cover evolutionary "aunts" and "cousins" of living groups, and have been hypothesized based on this scientific theory. A [[crown group]] is a group of closely related living animals plus their last common ancestor plus all its descendants. A stem group is a set of offshoots from the lineage at a point earlier than the last common ancestor of the crown group; it is a relative concept, for example [[tardigrade]]s are living animals that form a crown group in their own right, but Budd (1996) regarded them as also being a stem group relative to the arthropods.&lt;ref name="CraskeJefferies1989"&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Craske, A.J. | author2=Jefferies, R.P.S. | year=1989 | title=A new mitrate from the Upper Ordovician of Norway, and a new approach to subdividing a plesion | journal=Palaeontology | volume=32 | pages=69–99 | url=http://palaeontology.palass-pubs.org/pdf/Vol%2032/Pages%2069-99.pdf | format=PDF | access-date=2010-12-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824010939/http://palaeontology.palass-pubs.org/pdf/Vol%2032/Pages%2069-99.pdf# | archive-date=2011-08-24 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd1996"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
Groups that cannot easily be placed in an existing phylum are considered to be [[stem group]]s. A stem group annelid, for instance, is any group that was closely related to, but not within, the crown group "annelida". The stem group split off from the lineage that would lead to annelids, and eventually became extinct.

===Triploblastic===
The term ''[[Triploblastic]]'' means consisting of three layers, which are formed in the [[embryo]], quite early in the animal's development from a single-celled egg to a larva or juvenile form. The innermost layer forms the [[digestive tract]] (gut); the outermost forms skin; and the middle one forms muscles and all the internal organs except the digestive system. Most types of living animal are triploblastic&amp;nbsp;– the best-known exceptions are [[Porifera]] (sponges) and [[Cnidaria]] (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.).

===Bilaterian===
The [[bilateria]]ns are animals that have right and left sides at some point in their life histories. This implies that they have top and bottom surfaces and, importantly, distinct front and back ends. All known bilaterian animals are triploblastic, and all known triploblastic animals are bilaterian. Living [[echinoderm]]s ([[sea star]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumbers]], etc.) 'look' radially symmetrical (like wheels) rather than bilaterian, but their larvae exhibit bilateral symmetry and some of the earliest echinoderms may have been bilaterally symmetrical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Paired gill slits in a fossil with a calcite skeleton | journal=Nature | issue=6891 | pages=841–844 |date=June 2002 | doi=10.1038/nature00805 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v417/n6891/abs/nature00805.html |author1=Dominguez, P. |author2=Jacobson, A.G. |author3=Jefferies, R.P.S. | volume=417 | pmid=12075349 | issn=0028-0836 |bibcode = 2002Natur.417..841D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Porifera and Cnidaria are radially symmetrical, not bilaterian, and not triploblastic.

===Coelomate===
The term ''[[Coelomate]]'' means having a body cavity (coelom) containing the internal organs. Most of the phyla featured in the debate about the Cambrian explosion are coelomates: arthropods, [[annelid]] worms, molluscs, echinoderms, and [[chordate]]s&amp;nbsp;– the noncoelomate [[priapulid]]s are an important exception. All known coelomate animals are triploblastic bilaterians, but some triploblastic bilaterian animals do not have a coelom&amp;nbsp;– for example [[flatworm]]s, whose organs are surrounded by [[parenchyma|unspecialized tissues]].

==Precambrian life==
Understanding of the Cambrian explosion relies upon knowing what was there beforehand{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}&amp;nbsp;– did the event herald the sudden appearance of a wide range of animals and behaviours, or did such things exist beforehand?

[[Phylogenetic analysis]] has been used to support the view that during the Cambrian explosion, metazoans (multi-celled animals) evolved [[monophyly|monophyletically]] from a single common ancestor: flagellated colonial [[protists]] similar to modern [[choanoflagellates]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Evidence of animals around 1 billion years ago ===
:''For further information, see [[Acritarch]] and [[Stromatolite]]''

[[File:Stromatolites in Sharkbay.jpg|right|thumb|Modern stromatolites in [[Hamelin Pool Marine Nature Reserve]], Western Australia]]

Changes in the abundance and diversity of some types of fossil have been interpreted as evidence for "attacks" by animals or other organisms. Stromatolites, stubby pillars built by colonies of [[microorganism]]s, are a major constituent of the fossil record from about {{Ma|2700}}, but their abundance and diversity declined steeply after about {{Ma|1250}}. This decline has been attributed to disruption by grazing and burrowing animals.&lt;ref name="McNamara1996DatingOriginAnimals"&gt;

Precambrian marine diversity was dominated by small fossils known as [[acritarch]]s. This term describes almost any small organic walled fossil – from the egg cases of small [[animal|metazoans]] to resting [[cyst]]s of many different kinds of [[chlorophyta|green algae]]. After appearing around {{Ma|2000}}, acritarchs underwent a boom around {{Ma|1000}}, increasing in abundance, diversity, size, complexity of shape, and especially size and number of spines. Their increasingly spiny forms in the last 1 billion years may indicate an increased need for defence against predation. Other groups of small organisms from the [[Neoproterozoic]] era also show signs of antipredator defenses.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2002OriginsOfPredation"/&gt; A consideration of taxon longevity appears to support an increase in predation pressure around this time.&lt;ref name="Stanley2008"&gt;

Around the start of the Cambrian (about {{Ma|542}}), many new types of traces first appear, including well-known vertical burrows such as ''[[Diplocraterion]]'' and ''[[Skolithos]]'', and traces normally attributed to arthropods, such as ''[[Cruziana]]'' and ''[[Rusophycus]]''. The vertical burrows indicate that worm-like animals acquired new behaviours, and possibly new physical capabilities. Some Cambrian trace fossils indicate that their makers possessed hard [[exoskeleton]]s, although they were not necessarily mineralised.&lt;ref name="Jensen2003" /&gt;

Burrows provide firm evidence of complex organisms; they are also much more readily preserved than body fossils, to the extent that the absence of trace fossils has been used to imply the genuine absence of large, motile, bottom-dwelling organisms.{{Citation needed|reason=try Budd|date=June 2008}} They provide a further line of evidence to show that the Cambrian explosion represents a real diversification, and is not a preservational artefact.&lt;ref name="Seilacher2005"/&gt;

This new habit changed the seafloor's geochemistry, and led to decreased oxygen in the ocean and increased CO2-levels in the seas and the atmosphere, resulting in global warming for tens of millions years, and could be responsible for mass extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.inverse.com/article/46647-global-warming-animals-cambrian-carbon-dioxide Early Global Warming Was Unexpectedly Caused by a Burst of Tiny Life Forms - Inverse]&lt;/ref&gt; But as burrowing became established, it allowed an explosion of its own,&lt;!--this is carefully worded so as not to imply that was neither a part of the Cambrian explosion, or necessarily different from it&amp;nbsp;– please take this into account when rewording!--&gt; for as burrowers disturbed the sea floor, they aerated it, mixing oxygen into the toxic muds. This made the bottom sediments more hospitable, and allowed a wider range of organisms to inhabit them&amp;nbsp;– creating new niches and the scope for higher diversity.&lt;ref name="Seilacher2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Seilacher, Adolf |author2=Luis A.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there seems little doubt that ''Kimberella'' was at least a triploblastic bilaterian animal.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2006"/&gt; These organisms are central to the debate about how abrupt the Cambrian explosion was. If some were early members of the animal phyla seen today, the "explosion" looks a lot less sudden than if all these organisms represent an unrelated "experiment", and were replaced by the animal kingdom fairly soon thereafter (40M years is "soon" by evolutionary and geological standards).

===Beck Spring Dolomite===
Paul Knauth, a geologist at [[Arizona State University]], maintains that photosynthesizing organisms such as algae may have grown over a 750- to 800-million-year-old formation in [[Death Valley]] known as the Beck Spring Dolomite. In the early 1990s, samples from this 1,000-foot thick layer of dolomite revealed that the region housed flourishing mats of photosynthesizing, unicellular life forms which antedated the Cambrian explosion.

Microfossils have been unearthed from holes riddling the otherwise barren surface of the dolomite. These geochemical and microfossil findings support the idea that during the Precambrian period, complex life evolved both in the oceans and on land. Knauth contends that animals may well have had their origins in freshwater lakes and streams, and not in the oceans.

Some 30 years later, a number of studies have documented an abundance of geochemical and microfossil evidence showing that life covered the continents as far back as 2.2 billion years ago. Many paleobiologists now accept the idea that simple life forms existed on land during the Precambrian, but are opposed to the more radical idea that multicellular life thrived on land more than 600 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/death-valleys-first-life-came-in-by-land-not-by-sea/ "Scientific American" April 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lowest Cambrian, the stromatolites were decimated. This allowed animals to begin colonization of warm-water pools with carbonate sedimentation. At first, it was [[anabaritid]]s and ''[[Protohertzina]]'' (the fossilized grasping spines of [[Chaetognatha|chaetognaths]]) fossils. Such mineral skeletons as shells, sclerites, thorns, and plates appeared in uppermost [[Nemakit-Daldynian]]; they were the earliest species of [[halkieria|halkierids]], [[Helcionelloida|gastropods]], [[hyolitha|hyoliths]] and other rare organisms. The beginning of the [[Tommotian]] has historically been understood to mark an explosive increase of the number and variety of fossils of molluscs, [[hyolith]]s, and [[sponge]]s, along with a rich complex of skeletal elements of unknown animals, the first [[archaeocyathid]]s, [[brachiopod]]s, [[tommotiid]]s, and others.&lt;ref name="Steiner2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.palaeo.2007.03.046| last1 = Steiner | first1 = M. | last2 = Li | first2 = G. | last3 = Qian | first3 = Y. | last4 = Zhu | first4 = M. | last5 = Erdtmann | first5 = B.

==Cambrian life==
=== Trace fossils ===
Trace fossils (burrows, etc.) are a reliable indicator of what life was around, and indicate a diversification of life around the start of the Cambrian, with the freshwater realm colonized by animals almost as quickly as the oceans.&lt;ref name="Kennedy2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kennedy | first1 = M.

===Small shelly fauna===
{{Main|Small shelly fauna}}
Fossils known as "[[small shelly fauna]]" have been found in many parts on the world, and date from just before the Cambrian to about 10 million years after the start of the Cambrian (the [[Nemakit-Daldynian]] and [[Tommotian]] ages; see [[#Timeline|timeline]]). These are a very mixed collection of fossils: spines, sclerites (armor plates), tubes, [[archeocyathid]]s (sponge-like animals), and small shells very like those of [[brachiopod]]s and snail-like molluscs&amp;nbsp;– but all tiny, mostly 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;mm long.&lt;ref name="Matthews1975"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While small, these fossils are far more common than complete fossils of the organisms that produced them; crucially, they cover the window from the start of the Cambrian to the first lagerstätten: a period of time otherwise lacking in fossils. Hence, they supplement the conventional fossil record and allow the fossil ranges of many groups to be extended.

===Early Cambrian trilobites and echinoderms===
[[File:Olenoides serratus oblique with antennas.jpg|thumb|A fossilized trilobite, an ancient type of [[arthropod]]: This specimen, from the Burgess Shale, preserves "soft parts"&amp;nbsp;– the antennae and legs. ]]

The fossil record of trilobites began with the appearance of trilobites with mineral exoskeletons – not from the time of their origin.

The earliest generally accepted echinoderm fossils appeared a little bit later, in the Late [[Atdabanian]]; unlike modern echinoderms, these early Cambrian echinoderms were not all radially symmetrical.&lt;ref name="DornbosBottjer2000Helicoplacoids"&gt;{{cite journal

These provide firm data points for the "end" of the explosion, or at least indications that the crown groups of modern phyla were represented.

===Burgess Shale type faunas===
{{main|Burgess Shale type preservation}}
The Burgess Shale and similar lagerstätten preserve the soft parts of organisms, which provide a wealth of data to aid in the classification of enigmatic fossils. It often preserved complete specimens of organisms only otherwise known from dispersed parts, such as loose scales or isolated mouthparts. Further, the majority of organisms and taxa in these horizons are entirely soft-bodied, hence absent from the rest of the fossil record.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2003"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a large part of the ecosystem is preserved, the ecology of the community can also be tentatively reconstructed.{{Verify source|Caron 2006 needs incorporating&amp;nbsp;– see talk page|date=July 2008}}
However, the assemblages may represent a "museum": a deep-water ecosystem that is evolutionarily "behind" the rapidly diversifying fauna of shallower waters.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorris2008"&gt;{{cite journal

Because the lagerstätten provide a mode and quality of preservation that is virtually absent outside of the Cambrian, many organisms appear completely different from anything known from the conventional fossil record. This led early workers in the field to attempt to shoehorn the organisms into extant phyla; the shortcomings of this approach led later workers to erect a multitude of new phyla to accommodate all the oddballs. It has since been realised that most oddballs diverged from [[stem group|lineages]] before they established the phyla known today{{Clarify|date=August 2008}}&amp;nbsp;– slightly different designs, which were fated to perish rather than flourish into phyla, as their cousin lineages did.

The preservational mode is rare in the preceding Ediacaran period, but those assemblages known show no trace of animal life&amp;nbsp;– perhaps implying a genuine absence of macroscopic metazoans.&lt;ref name="Xiao2002"&gt;{{cite journal

===Early Cambrian crustaceans===
{{Details|Orsten}}
Crustaceans, one of the four great modern groups of arthropods, are very rare throughout the Cambrian. Convincing crustaceans were once thought to be common in Burgess Shale-type biotas, but none of these individuals can be shown to fall into the crown group of "true crustaceans".&lt;ref name="Harvey2008"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cambrian record of crown-group crustaceans comes from microfossils. The Swedish [[Orsten]] horizons contain later Cambrian crustaceans, but only organisms smaller than 2&amp;nbsp;mm are preserved. This restricts the data set to juveniles and miniaturised adults.

A more informative data source is the organic microfossils of the [[Mount Cap formation]], Mackenzie Mountains, Canada. This late Early Cambrian assemblage ({{Ma|510|515}}) consists of microscopic fragments of arthropods' cuticle, which is left behind when the rock is dissolved with [[hydrofluoric acid]]. The diversity of this assemblage is similar to that of modern crustacean faunas. Analysis of fragments of feeding machinery found in the formation shows that it was adapted to feed in a very precise and refined fashion. This contrasts with most other early Cambrian arthropods, which fed messily by shovelling anything they could get their feeding appendages on into their mouths. This sophisticated and specialised feeding machinery belonged to a large (about 30&amp;nbsp;cm)&lt;ref&gt;{{PalAss2007|title=The ecology and phylogeny of Cambrian pancrustaceans|author=Harvey, T.P.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; organism, and would have provided great potential for diversification; specialised feeding apparatus allows a number of different approaches to feeding and development, and creates a number of different approaches to avoid being eaten.&lt;ref name="Harvey2008"/&gt;

Different authors break the explosion down into stages in different ways.

Ed Landing recognizes three stages: Stage 1, spanning the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, corresponds to a diversification of biomineralizing animals and of deep and complex burrows; Stage 2, corresponding to the radiation of molluscs and stem-group [[Brachiopod]]s ([[hyolith]]s and [[tommotiid]]s), which apparently arose in intertidal waters; and Stage 3, seeing the Atdabanian diversification of trilobites in deeper waters, but little change in the intertidal realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Landing | first1=E. | last2=Kouchinsky | first2=A.

Graham Budd synthesises various schemes to produce a compatible view of the SSF record of the Cambrian explosion, divided slightly differently into four intervals: a "Tube world", lasting from {{Ma|550|536}}, spanning the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, dominated by Cloudina, Namacalathus and pseudoconodont-type elements; a "Sclerite world", seeing the rise of halkieriids, tommotiids, and hyoliths, lasting to the end of the Fortunian (c. 525 Ma); a brachiopod world, perhaps corresponding to the as yet unratified Cambrian Stage 2; and Trilobite World, kicking off in Stage 3.&lt;ref name="Budd, G.E. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Budd | first1=G.E. | last2=Jackson | first2=I.S.C. | year=2016 | title=Ecological innovations in the Cambrian and the origins of the crown group phyla | journal=Phil.

Complementary to the shelly fossil record, trace fossils can be divided into five subdivisions: "Flat world" (late Ediacaran), with traces restricted to the sediment surface; Protreozoic III (after Jensen), with increasing complexity; ''pedum'' world, initiated at the base of the Cambrian with the base of the ''T.pedum'' zone (see discussion at [[Cambrian#Dating the Cambrian]]); ''Rusophycus'' world, spanning {{Ma|536|521}} and thus corresponding exactly to the periods of Sclerite World and Brachiopod World under the SSF paradigm; and ''Cruziana'' world, with an obvious correspondence to Trilobite World.

The fossil record as Darwin knew it seemed to suggest that the major metazoan groups appeared in a few million years of the early to mid-Cambrian, and even in the 1980s, this still appeared to be the case.&lt;ref name="Whittington1985BurgessShale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WonderfulLife"/&gt;

However, evidence of Precambrian Metazoa is gradually accumulating.

Some say that the evolutionary change was accelerated by an [[order of magnitude]],{{refn |group=note |As defined in terms of the extinction and origination rate of species.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"/&gt;}} but the presence of Precambrian animals somewhat dampens the "bang" of the explosion; not only was the appearance of animals gradual, but their [[evolutionary radiation]] ("diversification") may also not have been as rapid as once thought.

The fossil record is consistent with a Cambrian explosion that was limited to the benthos, with pelagic phyla evolving much later.&lt;ref name=Budd2000/&gt;

Ecological complexity among marine animals increased in the Cambrian, as well later in the Ordovician.&lt;ref name="Bambach2007" /&gt; However, recent research has overthrown the once-popular idea that disparity was exceptionally high throughout the Cambrian, before subsequently decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Erwin, D.H. | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4983.2006.00614.x | title = Disparity: Morphological Pattern And Developmental Context | journal = Palaeontology | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, disparity remains relatively low throughout the Cambrian, with modern levels of disparity only attained after the early Ordovician radiation.&lt;ref name="Bambach2007"/&gt;

===The Cambrian explosion as survivorship bias===

[[Graham Budd|Budd]] and Mann&lt;ref name="POTPa"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Budd |first1=G. E. |last2=Mann |first2=R. P. |title=History is written by the victors: the effect of the push of the past on the fossil record |journal=Evolution |date=2018 |volume=72 |issue=11 |pages=2276-229 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.13593}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the Cambrian explosion was the result of a type of [[survivorship bias]] called the "[[Push of the past]]". As groups at their origin tend to go extinct, it follows that any long-lived group would have experienced an unusually rapid rate of diversification early on, creating the illusion of a general speed-up in diversification rates. However, rates of diversification could remain at background levels and still generate this sort of effect in the surviving lineages.

==Possible causes==
Despite the evidence that moderately complex animals ([[triploblastic]] [[bilateria]]ns) existed before and possibly long before the start of the Cambrian, it seems that the pace of evolution was exceptionally fast in the early Cambrian. Possible explanations for this fall into three broad categories: environmental, developmental, and ecological changes. Any explanation must explain both the timing and magnitude of the explosion.

===Changes in the environment===
====Increase in oxygen levels====
[[Earth's atmosphere#Evolution of Earth's atmosphere|Earth's earliest atmosphere]] contained no free [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); the oxygen that animals breathe today, both in the air and dissolved in water, is the product of billions of years of [[photosynthesis]]. Cyanobacteria were the first organisms to evolve the ability to photosynthesize, introducing a steady supply of oxygen into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schirrmeister|first1=B.E.|last2=deVos|first2=J.M|last3=Antonelli|first3=A.|last4=Bagherri|first4=H.C.|title=Evolution of multicellularity coincided with increased diversification of cyanobacteria and the Great Oxidation Event|journal=PNAS|date=2013|volume=110|issue=5|pages=1791–1796|doi=10.1073/pnas.1209927110|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.1791S|pmid=23319632|pmc=3562814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, oxygen levels did not increase substantially in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Canfield|first1=D.E.|last2=Poulton|first2=S.W.|last3=Narbonne|first3=G.M.|title=Late-Neoproterozoic Deep-Ocean Oxygenation and the Rise of Animal Life|journal=Science|date=2007|volume=315|doi=10.1126/science.1135013|pmid=17158290|issue=5808|pages=92–5|bibcode=2007Sci...315...92C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oxygen quickly reacted with iron and other minerals in the surrounding rock and ocean water. Once a saturation point was reached for the reactions in rock and water, oxygen was able to exist as a gas in its diatomic form. Oxygen levels in the atmosphere increased substantially afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bekker|first1=A.|last2=Holland|first2=H.D.|last3=Wang|first3=P.I.|last4=Rumble, III|first4=D.|last5=Stein|first5=H.J.|last6=Hannah|first6=J.L.|last7=Coetzee|first7=L.L.|last8=Beukes|first8=H.J.|title=Dating the rise of atmospheric oxygen|journal=Nature|date=2003|volume=427|issue=6970|pages=117–120|doi=10.1038/nature02260|pmid=14712267|bibcode=2004Natur.427..117B}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a general trend, the [[concentration]] of oxygen in the atmosphere has risen gradually over about the last 2.5 billion years.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"/&gt;

Oxygen levels seem to have a positive correlation with diversity in eukaryotes well before the Cambrian period.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parfrey|first1=L.W.|last2=Lahr|first2=D.J.G.|last3=Knoll|first3=A.H.|last4=Katz|first4=L.A.|title=Estimating the timing of early eukaryotic diversification with multigene molecular clocks|journal=PNAS|date=2011|volume=108|issue=33|pages=13624–13629|doi=10.1073/pnas.1110633108|pmid=21810989|pmc=3158185|bibcode = 2011PNAS..10813624P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last common ancestor of all extant eukaryotes is thought to have lived around 1.8 billion years ago. Around 800 million years ago, there was a notable increase in the complexity and number of eukaryotes species in the fossil record.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Before the spike in diversity, eukaryotes are thought to have lived in highly sulfuric environments. Sulfide interferes with mitochondrial function in aerobic organisms, limiting the amount of oxygen that could be used to drive metabolism. Oceanic sulfide levels decreased around 800 million years ago, which supports the importance of oxygen in eukaryotic diversity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The shortage of oxygen might well have prevented the rise of large, complex animals. The amount of oxygen an animal can absorb is largely determined by the area of its oxygen-absorbing surfaces (lungs and gills in the most complex animals; the skin in less complex ones); but, the amount needed is determined by its volume, which grows faster than the oxygen-absorbing area if an animal's size increases equally in all directions. An increase in the concentration of oxygen in air or water would increase the size to which an organism could grow without its tissues becoming starved of oxygen. However, members of the Ediacara biota reached metres in length tens of millions of years before the Cambrian explosion.&lt;ref name="Knoll1999"&gt;e.g. {{cite journal

====Ozone formation====
The amount of ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) required to shield Earth from biologically lethal UV radiation, wavelengths from 200 to 300 nanometers (nm), is believed to have been in existence around the Cambrian explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keese| first1=Bob|title=Ozone| url=http://www.albany.edu/faculty/rgk/atm101/ozone.htm|website=www.albany.edu |publisher=University at Albany| access-date=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of the [[ozone layer]] may have enabled the development of complex life and life on land, as opposed to life being restricted to the water.

====Snowball Earth====
{{main|Snowball Earth}}
In the late [[Neoproterozoic]] (extending into the early [[Ediacaran]] period), the Earth suffered [[Snowball Earth|massive glaciations]] in which most of its surface was covered by ice. This may have caused a mass extinction, creating a genetic bottleneck; the resulting diversification may have given rise to the [[Ediacara biota]], which appears soon after the last "Snowball Earth" episode.&lt;ref name="HoffmanKaufman1998NeoproterozoicSnowball"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the snowball episodes occurred a long time before the start of the Cambrian, and it is hard to see how so much diversity could have been caused by even a series of bottlenecks;&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining" /&gt; the cold periods may even have ''delayed'' the evolution of large size organisms.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2002OriginsOfPredation"/&gt;

====Increase in the calcium concentration of the Cambrian seawater====
Newer research suggests that volcanically active midocean ridges caused a massive and sudden surge of the calcium concentration in the oceans, making it possible for marine organisms to build skeletons and hard body parts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibecbarcelona.eu/novel-evolutionary-theory-for-the-explosion-of-life/ Novel Evolutionary Theory For The Explosion Of Life]&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternatively a high influx of ions could have been provided by the widespread erosion that produced Powell's [[Great Unconformity]].&lt;ref name="Peters2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Peters | first1 = S.

An increase of calcium may also have been caused by erosion of the [[East African Orogeny|Transgondwanan Supermountain]] that existed at the time the explosion. The roots of the mountain are preserved in present-day [[East Africa]] as an [[orogeny|orogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Developmental explanations===
{{further|Evolutionary developmental biology}}

A range of theories are based on the concept that minor [[Evolutionary developmental biology|modifications to animals' development]] as they grow from [[embryo]] to adult may have been able to cause very large changes in the final adult form. The [[Hox gene]]s, for example, control which organs individual regions of an embryo will develop into. For instance, if a certain ''Hox'' gene is expressed, a region will develop into a limb; if a different Hox gene is expressed in that region (a minor change), it could develop into an eye instead (a phenotypically major change).

Such a system allows a large range of disparity to appear from a limited set of genes, but such theories linking this with the explosion struggle to explain why the origin of such a development system should by itself lead to increased diversity or disparity. Evidence of Precambrian metazoans&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining" /&gt; combines with molecular data&lt;ref name="deRosa1999"&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Rosa, R. |author2=Grenier, J.K. |author3=Andreeva, T. |author4=Cook, C.E. |author5=Adoutte, A. |author6=Akam, M. |author7=Carroll, S.B. |author8=Balavoine, G. |date=June 1999 | doi = 10.1038/21631 | journal = Nature | volume = 399 |title=Hox genes in brachiopods and priapulids and protostome evolution | pmid = 10391241  | issue = 6738 | issn = 0028-0836 | pages = 772–6|bibcode = 1999Natur.399..772D }}&lt;/ref&gt; to show that much of the genetic architecture that could feasibly have played a role in the explosion was already well established by the Cambrian.

This apparent paradox is addressed in a theory that focuses on the [[physics]] of development. It is proposed that the emergence of simple multicellular forms provided a changed context and spatial scale in which novel physical processes and effects were mobilized by the products of genes that had previously evolved to serve unicellular functions. Morphological complexity (layers, segments, lumens, appendages) arose, in this view, by [[self-organization]].&lt;ref name="Newman2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Newman, S.A.  |author2=Bhat, R. |date=April 2008 | doi = 10.1088/1478-3975/5/1/015008| journal = Physical Biology | volume = 5 | page = 0150580|title=Dynamical patterning modules: physico-genetic determinants of morphological development and evolution | pmid = 18403826  | issue = 1 | issn = 1478-3967|bibcode = 2008PhBio...5a5008N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Horizontal gene transfer]] has also been identified as a possible factor in the rapid acquisition of the biochemical capability of biomineralization among organisms during this period, based on evidence that the gene for a critical protein in the process was originally transferred from a bacterium into sponges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Daniel J.|last2=Macis|first2=Luciana|last3=Reitner|first3=Joachim|last4=Wörheide|first4=Gert|title=A horizontal gene transfer supported the evolution of an early metazoan biomineralization strategy|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|date=12 August 2011|volume=11|page=238|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-11-238|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/238|access-date=10 September 2014|pmid=21838889|pmc=3163562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological explanations===
These focus on the interactions between different types of organism. Some of these hypotheses deal with changes in the [[food chain]]; some suggest [[Evolutionary arms race|arms races]] between predators and prey, and others focus on the more general mechanisms of [[coevolution]]. Such theories are well suited to explaining why there was a rapid increase in both disparity and diversity, but they must explain why the "explosion" happened when it did.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining"/&gt;

====End-Ediacaran mass extinction====
{{main|End-Ediacaran extinction}}
Evidence for such an extinction includes the disappearance from the fossil record of the Ediacara biota and shelly fossils such as ''Cloudina'', and the accompanying perturbation in the {{d13c|link}} record.

Mass extinctions are often followed by [[adaptive radiation]]s as existing clades expand to occupy the ecospace emptied by the extinction. However, once the dust had settled, overall disparity and diversity returned to the pre-extinction level in each of the Phanerozoic extinctions.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining" /&gt;

====Evolution of eyes====
{{main|Evolution of the eye}}
[[Andrew Parker (zoologist)|Andrew Parker]] has proposed that predator-prey relationships changed dramatically after eyesight evolved. Prior to that time, hunting and evading were both close-range affairs&amp;nbsp;– smell, vibration, and touch were the only senses used. When predators could see their prey from a distance, new defensive strategies were needed. Armor, spines, and similar defenses may also have evolved in response to vision. He further observed that, where animals lose vision in unlighted environments such as caves, diversity of animal forms tends to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Parker, Andrew | title=In the Blink of an Eye |publisher= Perseus Books |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | year=2003 | isbn=0-7382-0607-5 | oclc=52074044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many scientists doubt that vision could have caused the explosion. Eyes may well have evolved long before the start of the Cambrian.&lt;ref name="McCall2006"&gt;{{cite journal | author = McCall | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.earscirev.2005.08.004 | title = The Vendian (Ediacaran) in the geological record: Enigmas in geology's prelude to the Cambrian explosion | journal = Earth-Science Reviews | volume = 77 | pages = 1–229 |bibcode = 2006ESRv...77....1M }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also difficult to understand why the evolution of eyesight would have caused an explosion, since other senses, such as smell and pressure detection, can detect things at a greater distance in the sea than sight can; but the appearance of these other senses apparently did not cause an evolutionary explosion.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining"/&gt;

====Arms races between predators and prey====
The ability to avoid or recover from [[predation]] often makes the difference between life and death, and is therefore one of the strongest components of [[natural selection]]. The pressure to adapt is stronger on the prey than on the predator: if the predator fails to win a contest, it loses a meal; if the prey is the loser, it loses its life.&lt;ref name="DawkinsKrebs1979ArmsRaces"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Arms races between and within species| volume=205| issue=1161| pages=489–511| date=September 21, 1979| jstor=77442 |author1=Dawkins, R. |author2=Krebs, R.J.| doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0081
| journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]| pmid=42057| bibcode=1979RSPSB.205..489D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But, there is evidence that predation was rife long before the start of the Cambrian, for example in the increasingly spiny forms of acritarchs, the holes drilled in ''Cloudina'' shells, and traces of burrowing to avoid predators. Hence, it is unlikely that the ''appearance'' of predation was the trigger for the Cambrian "explosion", although it may well have exhibited a strong influence on the body forms that the "explosion" produced.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2002OriginsOfPredation"/&gt; However, the intensity of predation does appear to have increased dramatically during the Cambrian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1988 |author=McMenamin, M. A. S. |title=Palaeocological feedback and the Vendian-Cambrian transition |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=3 |pages=205–208 |doi=10.1016/0169-5347(88)90008-0 |pmid=21227202 |issue=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as new predatory "tactics" (such as shell-crushing) emerged.&lt;ref name="Zhang2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Zhang | first1=Z. | last2=Holmer | first2=L.

Thus the role of predators as triggerers of diversification may have been limited to the very beginning of the "Cambrian explosion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Increase in size and diversity of planktonic animals====
[[Geochemical]] evidence strongly indicates that the total mass of [[plankton]] has been similar to modern levels since early in the Proterozoic. Before the start of the Cambrian, their corpses and droppings were too small to fall quickly towards the seabed, since their [[drag (physics)|drag]] was about the same as their weight. This meant they were destroyed by [[scavenger]]s or by chemical processes before they reached the sea floor.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001"&gt;{{cite journal

Mesozooplankton are plankton of a larger size. Early Cambrian specimens [[Filter feeder|filtered]] microscopic plankton from the seawater. These larger organisms would have produced droppings and corpses that were large enough to fall fairly quickly. This provided a new supply of energy and nutrients to the mid-levels and bottoms of the seas, which opened up a huge range of new possible ways of life. If any of these remains sank uneaten to the sea floor they could be buried; this would have taken some [[carbon]] out of [[Carbon cycle|circulation]], resulting in an increase in the [[concentration]] of breathable oxygen in the seas (carbon readily [[Chemical compound|combines]] with oxygen).&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001"/&gt;

The initial herbivorous mesozooplankton were probably larvae of benthic (seafloor) animals. A larval stage was probably an evolutionary innovation driven by the increasing level of predation at the seafloor during the [[Ediacaran]] period.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001ECR"&gt;{{Cite book

Metazoans have an amazing ability to increase diversity through [[coevolution]].&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"/&gt; This means that an organism's traits can lead to traits evolving in other organisms; a number of responses are possible, and a different species can potentially emerge from each one. As a simple example, the evolution of predation may have caused one organism to develop a defence, while another developed motion to flee. This would cause the predator lineage to split into two species: one that was good at chasing prey, and another that was good at breaking through defences. Actual coevolution is somewhat more subtle, but, in this fashion, great diversity can arise: three quarters of living species are animals, and most of the rest have formed by coevolution with animals.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"/&gt;

===Ecosystem engineering===
Evolving organisms inevitably change the environment they evolve in. The [[Devonian]] [[Colonization of the land|colonization of land]] had planet-wide consequences for sediment cycling and ocean nutrients, and was likely linked to the [[Devonian extinction|Devonian mass extinction]]. A similar process may have occurred on smaller scales in the oceans, with, for example, the sponges filtering particles from the water and depositing them in the mud in a more digestible form; or burrowing organisms making previously unavailable resources available for other organisms.&lt;ref name="Erwin2011a"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Erwin | first1 = D.

===Complexity threshold===
The explosion may not have been a significant evolutionary event. It may represent a threshold being crossed: for example a threshold in genetic complexity that allowed a vast range of morphological forms to be employed.&lt;ref name="SoléFernándezKauffman2003AdaptiveWalks"&gt;{{cite journal

| arxiv=q-bio/0311013
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This genetic threshold may have a correlation to the amount of oxygen available to organisms. Using oxygen for metabolism produces much more energy than anaerobic processes. Organisms that use more oxygen have the opportunity to produce more complex proteins, providing a template for further evolution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These proteins translate into larger, more complex structures that allow organisms better to adapt to their environments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sperling|first1=E.A.|last2=Frieder|first2=C.A.|last3=Raman|first3=A.V.|last4=Girguis|first4=P.R.|last5=Levin|first5=L.A.|last6=Knoll|first6=A.H.|title=Oxygen, ecology, and the Cambrian radiation of animals|journal=PNAS|date=2013|volume=110|issue=33|pages=13446–13451|doi=10.1073/pnas.1312778110|pmid=23898193|bibcode=2013PNAS..11013446S|pmc=3746845}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of oxygen, genes that code for these proteins could contribute to the expression of [[complex traits]] more efficiently. Access to a wider range of structures and functions would allow organisms to evolve in different directions, increasing the number of niches that could be inhabited. Furthermore, organisms had the opportunity to become more specialized in their own niches.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==Uniqueness of the explosion==
The "Cambrian explosion" can be viewed as two waves of metazoan expansion into empty niches: first, a [[coevolution]]ary rise in diversity as animals explored niches on the Ediacaran sea floor, followed by a second expansion in the early Cambrian as they became established in the water column.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Butterfield | first1 = N. J.| year = 2007| title = Macroevolution and macroecology through deep time| journal = Palaeontology| volume = 50| issue = 1| pages = 41–55| doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4983.2006.00613.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of diversification seen in the Cambrian phase of the explosion is unparalleled among marine animals: it affected all metazoan [[clade]]s of which Cambrian fossils have been found. Later [[Evolutionary radiation|radiations]], such as those of [[fish]] in the [[Silurian]] and [[Devonian]] periods, involved fewer [[taxon|taxa]], mainly with very similar body plans.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"/&gt; Although the recovery from the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian-Triassic extinction]] started with about as few animal species as the Cambrian explosion, the recovery produced far fewer significantly new types of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Erwin |first=D.H. |author2=Valentine, J.W. |author3=Sepkoski, J.J. |date=November 1987| title=A Comparative Study of Diversification Events: The Early Paleozoic Versus the Mesozoic |journal=Evolution |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=1177–1186 |doi=10.2307/2409086 |pmid=11542112|jstor=2409086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever triggered the early Cambrian diversification opened up an exceptionally wide range of previously unavailable [[ecological niche]]s. When these were all occupied, limited space existed for such wide-ranging diversifications to occur again, because strong competition existed in all niches and [[wikt:incumbent|incumbent]]s usually had the advantage. If a wide range of empty niches had continued, clades would be able to continue diversifying and become disparate enough for us to recognise them as different [[phylum|phyla]]; when niches are filled, lineages will continue to resemble one another long after they diverge, as limited opportunity exists for them to change their life-styles and forms.&lt;ref name="Valentine1995WhyNoNewPhyla"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Why No New Phyla after the Cambrian? Genome and Ecospace Hypotheses Revisited | author=Valentine, J.W. | journal=PALAIOS | issue=2 |date=April 1995 | pages=190–194 | doi=10.2307/3515182 | volume=10 | type=abstract | jstor=3515182
| bibcode=1995Palai..10..190V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two similar explosions in the [[Evolutionary history of plants#Colonisation of land|evolution of land plants]]: after a cryptic history beginning about {{Ma|450}}, land plants underwent a uniquely rapid adaptive radiation during the Devonian period, about {{Ma|400}}.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"/&gt; Furthermore, Angiosperms ([[flowering plant]]s) originated and rapidly diversified during the Cretaceous period.

The word ''cognition'' comes from the [[Latin]] verb ''cognosco'' (''con'', 'with', and ''gnōscō'', 'know'; itself a cognate of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] verb γι(γ)νώσκω, ''gi(g)nόsko'', meaning 'I know, perceive'), meaning 'to conceptualize' or 'to recognize'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Search for a Theory of Cognition: Early Mechanisms and New Ideas|author=Stefano Franchi, Francesco Bianchini|publisher=Rodopi, 2011|chapter=On The Historical Dynamics Of Cognitive Science: A View From The Periphery|page=XIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The beginnings of the studies on cognition ==
The word ''cognition'' dates back to the 15th century, when it meant "thinking and awareness".&lt;ref&gt;Cognition: Theory and Practice by Russell Revlin&lt;/ref&gt; Attention to cognitive processes came about more than eighteen centuries earlier, however, beginning with [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) and his interest in the inner workings of the mind and how they affect the human experience. Aristotle focused on cognitive areas pertaining to memory, perception, and mental imagery. He placed great importance on ensuring that his studies were based on empirical evidence, that is, scientific information that is gathered through observation and conscientious experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matlin|first=Margaret|title=Cognition|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, NJ|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two millennia later, as [[psychology]] emerged as a burgeoning field of study in Europe and then gained a following in America, other scientists like Wilhelm Wundt, Herman Ebbinghaus, Mary Whiton Calkins, and William James would offer their contributions to the study of human cognition.

[[Wilhelm Wundt]] (1832–1920) emphasized the notion of what he called introspection: examining the inner feelings of an individual. With introspection, the subject had to be careful to describe his or her feelings in the most objective manner possible in order for Wundt to find the information scientific.&lt;ref name="Fuchs"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fuchs|first=A. H.|author2=Milar, K.J.|title=Psychology as a science|journal=Handbook of psychology|year=2003|volume=1|issue=The history of psychology|pages=1–26|doi=10.1002/0471264385.wei0101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zangwill|first=O. L.|title=The Oxford companion to the mind|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=951–952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Wundt's contributions are by no means minimal, modern psychologists find his methods to be quite subjective and choose to rely on more objective procedures of experimentation to make conclusions about the human cognitive process.

[[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] (1850–1909) conducted cognitive studies that mainly examined the function and capacity of human memory. Ebbinghaus developed his own experiment in which he constructed over 2,000 syllables made out of nonexistent words, for instance EAS. He then examined his own personal ability to learn these non-words. He purposely chose non-words as opposed to real words to control for the influence of pre-existing experience on what the words might symbolize, thus enabling easier recollection of them.&lt;ref name=Fuchs /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Zangwill"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zangwill|first=O.L.|title=The Oxford companion to the mind|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebbinghaus observed and hypothesized a number of variables that may have affected his ability to learn and recall the non-words he created. One of the reasons, he concluded, was the amount of time between the presentation of the list of stimuli and the recitation or recall of same.  Ebbinghaus was the first to record and plot a "learning curve," and a "forgetting curve."&lt;ref&gt;T.L. Brink (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. "Unit 7: Memory." p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; His work heavily influenced the study of serial position and its effect on memory, discussed in subsequent sections.

[[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was an influential American pioneer in the realm of psychology. Her work also focused on the human memory capacity. A common theory, called the [[recency effect]], can be attributed to the studies that she conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Madigan|first=S.|author2=O'Hara, R.|title=Short-term memory at the turn of the century: Mary Whiton Calkin's memory research|journal=American Psychologist|year=1992|volume=47|pages=170–174|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.47.2.170|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recency effect, also discussed in the subsequent experiment section, is the tendency for individuals to be able to accurately recollect the final items presented in a sequence of stimuli. Calkin's theory is closely related to the aforementioned study and conclusion of the memory experiments conducted by Hermann Ebbinghaus.&lt;ref name="Matlin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Matlin|first=Margaret|title=Cognition|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, NJ|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William James]] (1842–1910) is another pivotal figure in the history of cognitive science. James was quite discontent with Wundt's emphasis on introspection and Ebbinghaus' use of nonsense stimuli. He instead chose to focus on the human learning experience in everyday life and its importance to the study of cognition. James' most significant contribution to the study and theory of cognition was his textbook ''Principles of Psychology'' that preliminarily examines aspects of cognition such as perception, memory, reasoning, and attention.&lt;ref name=Matlin /&gt;

== In psychology ==
[[File:Generalization process using trees PNG version.png|thumb|alt=Diagram|When the mind makes a generalization such as the [[concept]] of ''tree'', it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables higher-level thinking (abstract thinking).]]
In psychology, the term "cognition" is usually used within an [[information processing]] view of an individual's psychological [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functions]] (see [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]]),&lt;ref name="Sternberg2009"&gt;Sternberg, R. J., &amp; Sternberg, K. (2009). Cognitive psychology (6th Ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is the same in [[cognitive engineering]];&lt;ref name="Blomberg"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Blomberg, O.|year = 2011|title = Concepts of cognition for cognitive engineering|journal = [[International Journal of Aviation Psychology]]|volume = 21|issue = 1|pages = 85–104|doi = 10.1080/10508414.2011.537561}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a branch of [[social psychology]] called [[social cognition]], the term is used to explain [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]], and group dynamics.&lt;ref name="Sternberg2009"/&gt;

Human cognition is conscious and unconscious, concrete or abstract, as well as intuitive (like knowledge of a language) and conceptual (like a model of a language). It encompasses processes such as [[memory]], [[Association of Ideas|association]], [[concept formation]], [[pattern recognition]], [[language]], [[attention]], [[perception]], [[action (philosophy)|action]], [[problem solving]] and [[mental images|mental imagery]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sensation &amp; Perception'', 5th ed. 1999, Coren, Ward &amp; Enns, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Cognitive Psychology'', 5th ed. 1999, Best, John B., pp. 15–17&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, [[emotion]] was not thought of as a cognitive process, but now much research is being undertaken to examine the [[cognitive psychology]] of emotion; research is also focused on one's awareness of one's own strategies and methods of cognition, which is called [[metacognition]].

While few people would deny that cognitive processes are a function of the [[brain]], a cognitive theory will not necessarily make reference to the brain or to biological processes (compare [[neurocognitive]]). It may purely describe behavior in terms of information flow or function. Relatively recent fields of study such as [[neuropsychology]] aim to bridge this gap, using cognitive paradigms to understand how the brain implements the information-processing functions (see also [[cognitive neuroscience]]), or to understand how pure information-processing systems (e.g., computers) can simulate human cognition (see also [[artificial intelligence]]). The branch of psychology that studies brain injury to infer normal cognitive function is called [[cognitive neuropsychology]]. The links of cognition to [[evolution]]ary demands are studied through the investigation of [[animal cognition]].

=== Piaget's theory of cognitive development ===
For years, sociologists and psychologists have conducted studies on [[cognitive development]] or the construction of human thought or mental processes.

[[Jean Piaget]] was one of the most important and influential people in the field of Developmental Psychology. He believed that humans are unique in comparison to animals because we have the capacity to do "abstract symbolic reasoning." His work can be compared to [[Lev Vygotsky]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Erik Erikson]] who were also great contributors in the field of Developmental Psychology. Today, Piaget is known for studying the cognitive development in children. He studied his own three children and their intellectual development and came up with a theory that describes the stages children pass through during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|title=Jean Piaget Biography|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/profilesofmajorthinkers/p/piaget.htm|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Common experiments on human cognition ===
'''Serial position'''

The serial position experiment is meant to test a theory of memory that states that when information is given in a serial manner, we tend to remember information in the beginning of the sequence, called the primacy effect, and information in the end of the sequence, called the recency effect.  Consequently, information given in the middle of the sequence is typically forgotten, or not recalled as easily. This study predicts that the recency effect is stronger than the primacy effect, because the information that is most recently learned is still in working memory when asked to be recalled. Information that is learned first still has to go through a retrieval process. This experiment focuses on human memory processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Surprenant|first=A|title=Distinctiveness and serial position effects in total sequences|journal=Perception and Psychophysics|year=2001|volume=63|pages=737–745|doi=10.3758/BF03194434|pmid=11436742|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Word superiority'''

The word superiority experiment presents a subject with a word, or a letter by itself, for a brief period of time, i.e. 40ms, and they are then asked to recall the letter that was in a particular location in the word. By theory, the subject should be better able to correctly recall the letter when it was presented in a word than when it was presented in isolation. This experiment focuses on human speech and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krueger|first=L.|title=The word-superiority effect and phonological recoding|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|year=1992|volume=20|pages=685–694|doi=10.3758/BF03202718|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brown-Peterson'''

In the Brown-Peterson experiment, participants are briefly presented with a trigram and in one particular version of the experiment, they are then given a distractor task, asking them to identify whether a sequence of words are in fact words, or non-words (due to being misspelled, etc.). After the distractor task, they are asked to recall the trigram from before the distractor task. In theory, the longer the distractor task, the harder it will be for participants to correctly recall the trigram. This experiment focuses on human short-term memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nairne|first=J.|author2=Whiteman, H. |author3=Kelley, M. |title=Short-term forgetting of order under conditions of reduced interference|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology A: Human Experimental Psychology|year=1999|volume=52|pages=241–251|doi=10.1080/713755806|url=http://www1.psych.purdue.edu/~nairne/pdfs/32.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Memory span'''

During the memory span experiment, each subject is presented with a sequence of stimuli of the same kind; words depicting objects, numbers, letters that sound similar, and letters that sound dissimilar. After being presented with the stimuli, the subject is asked to recall the sequence of stimuli that they were given in the exact order in which it was given. In one particular version of the experiment, if the subject recalled a list correctly, the list length was increased by one for that type of material, and vice versa if it was recalled incorrectly. The theory is that people have a memory span of about seven items for numbers, the same for letters that sound dissimilar and short words. The memory span is projected to be shorter with letters that sound similar and with longer words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=May|first=C.|author2=Hasher, L. |author3=Kane, M. |title=The role of interference in memory span|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|year=1999|volume=27|pages=759–767|doi=10.3758/BF03198529|issue=5|pmid=10540805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Visual search'''

In one version of the visual search experiment, a participant is presented with a window that displays circles and squares scattered across it. The participant is to identify whether there is a green circle on the window. In the "featured" search, the subject is presented with several trial windows that have blue squares or circles and one green circle or no green circle in it at all. In the "conjunctive" search, the subject is presented with trial windows that have blue circles or green squares and a present or absent green circle whose presence the participant is asked to identify. What is expected is that in the feature searches, reaction time, that is the time it takes for a participant to identify whether a green circle is present or not, should not change as the number of distractors increases. Conjunctive searches where the target is absent should have a longer reaction time than the conjunctive searches where the target is present. The theory is that in feature searches, it is easy to spot the target, or if it is absent, because of the difference in color between the target and the distractors. In conjunctive searches where the target is absent, reaction time increases because the subject has to look at each shape to determine whether it is the target or not because some of the distractors if not all of them, are the same color as the target stimuli. Conjunctive searches where the target is present take less time because if the target is found, the search between each shape stops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=J. |author2=Cave, K. |author3=Franzel, S.|title=Guided search: An alternative to the feature integration model for visual search|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1989|volume=15|pages=419–433|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.15.3.419|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Knowledge representation'''

The [[semantic network]] of [[knowledge representation]] systems has been studied in various paradigms. One of the oldest paradigms is the [[leveling]] and [[sharpening]] of stories as they are repeated from memory studied by [[Frederic Bartlett|Bartlett]]. The [[semantic differential]] used [[factor analysis]] to determine the main meanings of words, finding that [[value (ethics)|value]] or "goodness" of words is the first factor. More controlled experiments examine the categorical relationships of words in [[free recall]]. The hierarchical structure of words has been explicitly mapped in [[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]]'s [[Wordnet]]. More dynamic models of semantic networks have been created and tested with [[neural network]] experiments based on computational systems such as [[latent semantic analysis]] (LSA), [[Thomas Bayes|Bayesian]] analysis, and multidimensional [[factor analysis]]. The semantics (meaning) of words is studied by all the disciplines of [[cognitive science]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

An emergent field of research, referred to as "Team Cognition", is arising in military sciences. "Team cognition" indicates “an emergent property of teams that results from the interplay of individual cognition and team process behaviors [...] [Team cognition] underlies team performance” (Arizona State University East, 2005, Cooke NJ, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Russo, M.; Fiedler, E.; Thomas, M.; McGhee (2005),  United States Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory.

==Criticism==
In July 2008, ''New York Times'' reporter Noam Cohen criticized disemvoweling as a moderation tool, citing a June 2008 dispute about the deletion of all posts on ''Boing Boing'' that mentioned sex columnist [[Violet Blue (author)|Violet Blue]]{{Citation needed|reason=citation needed to prove claim|date=May 2014}}
. In the ''Boing Boing'' comment threads resulting from this controversy, Nielsen Hayden used the disemvoweling technique. Cohen noted that disemvoweling was "Not quite censorship, but not quite unfettered commentary either."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Noam|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/07/business/media/07link.html|title=Poof!

Matt Baumgartner, a blogger at the [[Times Union (Albany)|Albany ''Times Union'']], reported in August 2009 that the newspaper's lawyers had told him to stop disemvoweling comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.timesunion.com/baumgartner/a-e-i-o-u-and-sometimes-why/1641/|title=A, E, I, O, U and sometimes why|last=Baumgartner |first=Matt |date=31 August 2009|website=City Brights|publisher=[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]] |accessdate=6 October 2009 |location=Albany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
Nielsen Hayden originally disemvoweled postings manually, using [[Microsoft Word]]. Because the letter Y is sometimes a vowel and sometimes a consonant, there are a variety of ways to treat it. Nielsen Hayden's policy was never to remove Y, in order to maintain legibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/008862.html#181688|title=Moderation certificate: Comment #10|last=Nielsen Hayden |first=Teresa |date=18 April 2007|website=Making Light |authorlink=Teresa Nielsen Hayden |accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Economic transparency''' refers to banks and other financial institutions that have made data available about their financial position and condition. The financial [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|collapse of renowned industries]] provoked demands for greater transparency to help improve corporate governance in the [[United States]] and other industrialized countries. Some economists assert that transparency is one of the most effective methods for regulation of economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.omicsonline.org/scholarly/economic-transparency-journals-articles-ppts-list.php|title=Economic Transparency|last=|first=|date=|website=International Journal of Economics &amp; Management Sciences|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, transparency and openness can help accelerate [[reform]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in [[Developing country|developing countries]] in situations which foreign aid and other US programmatic and diplomatic efforts will have less potency and influence. It can promote responsible practices that directly and indirectly support a broad range of US policy objectives, such as (1) exposing government corruption, (2) reducing the scope for government revenues to be siphoned offshore, (3) increasing collection of domestic tax revenues, (4) increasing the accountability and effectiveness of government spending (including aid), (5) reducing dependency on foreign aid, and (6) helping to prevent money laundering and terrorist finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.cgdev.org/publication/ft/promoting-development-power-economic-transparency|title=Promoting the Development Power of Economic Transparency|last=|first=|publisher=WHITE HOUSE AND THE WORLD POLICY BRIEFS|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Emotion}}
'''Enthusiasm''' is intense [[enjoyment]], [[interest (emotion)|interest]], or [[Approval rating|approval]].  The word was originally used to refer to a person possessed by a [[god]], or someone who exhibited intense [[piety]].

==Historical usage== 
[[File:Enthusiastic auxiliarist (6956097739).jpg|thumb|left|150px|A U.S. Coast Guard auxiliarist looking enthusiastic.]]
The word originates from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt: ἐνθουσιασμός|ἐνθουσιασμός]] from [[wikt: ἐν|ἐν]] and [[wikt: θεός|θεός]] and [[wikt:οὐσία|οὐσία]], meaning "possessed by [a] god's essence", applied by the [[Greeks]] to [[manifestation of God|manifestations]] of divine possession, by [[Apollo]] (as in the case of the [[Pythia]]), or by [[Dionysus]] (as in the case of the [[Bacchantes]] and [[Maenads]]), the term enthusiasm was also used in a transferred or figurative sense. [[Socrates]] taught that the inspiration of [[poet]]s is a form of enthusiasm. The term was confined to a belief in religious inspiration, or to intense religious fervour or [[emotion]].

[[File:CarvaggioWadsworthHartford.jpg|thumb|300px|''Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy'' by [[Caravaggio]], 1594]]
From this, a [[Syrian]] sect of the 4th century was known as the Enthusiasts. They believed that "by perpetual [[prayer]], ascetic practices and [[contemplation]], man could become [[Biblical inspiration|inspired]] by the Holy Spirit, in spite of the ruling evil spirit, which the fall had given to him". From their belief in the [[efficacy of prayer]], they were also known as [[Euchites]].

Several [[Protestant]] [[sect]]s of the 16th and 17th centuries were called enthusiastic. During the years that immediately followed the [[Glorious Revolution]], "enthusiasm" was a British pejorative term for advocacy of any political or religious cause in public, i.e. [[fanaticism]]. Such "enthusiasm" was seen in the time around 1700 as the cause of the previous century's [[English Civil War]] and its attendant atrocities, and thus it was an absolute social sin to remind others of the war by engaging in enthusiasm. The [[Royal Society]] bylaws stipulated that any person discussing religion or politics at a Society meeting was to be summarily ejected for being an "enthusiast."{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} During the 18th century, popular [[Methodists]] such as [[John Wesley]] or [[George Whitefield]] were accused of blind enthusiasm, a charge against which they defended themselves by distinguishing fanaticism from "religion of the heart."

'''Equanimity''' ([[Latin]]: ''æquanimitas'', having an even mind; ''aequus'' even; ''animus'' mind/soul) is a state of psychological stability and composure which is undisturbed by experience of or exposure to emotions, pain, or other phenomena that may cause others to lose the balance of their mind.  The [[virtue]] and value of equanimity is extolled and advocated by a number of  major religions and ancient philosophies.
{{wikt}}

==Etymology==
From Fr. ''équanimité'', from L. ''aequanimitatem'' (nom. ''aequanimitas'') "evenness of mind, calmness," from ''aequus'' "even, level" (see equal) + ''animus'' "mind, spirit" (see animus). Meaning "evenness of temper" in English is from 1610s.

==Hinduism==
In Hinduism the term for equanimity is समत्व ''[[samatva]]m'' (also rendered ''samatva'' or ''samata'').&lt;ref&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of Yoga and Tantra'', [[Georg Feuerstein]], 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Chapter Two, Verse 48 of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' one reads: ''yoga-sthaḥ kuru karmāṇi saṅgaṁ tyaktvā dhanañ-jaya siddhy-asiddhyoḥ samo bhūtvā samatvaṁ yoga ucyate''. [[Srila Prabhupada]] translates this as: Perform your duty equipoised, O Arjuna, abandoning all attachment to success or failure. Such equanimity is called yoga.&lt;ref&gt;''Bhagavad Gita As it Is'', A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda&lt;/ref&gt;
                
In his book ''Samatvam - The Yoga of Equanimity'', [[Swami Sivananda]] states: 

"An aspirant who treads the path to ''samatvam'' must make every effort to acquire the following essential qualities: ''[[Viveka]]'', discrimination; ''[[vairagya]]'', dispassion; ''shadsampat'', the six virtues (''shama'', mental calmness and control; ''dama'', restraint of the senses; ''[[uparati]]'', sense withdrawal or ''[[pratyahara]]''; ''[[titiksha]]'', endurance; ''shraddha'', faith and ''[[samadhana]]'', mental balance); and an intense desire for liberation, ''mumukshutva''. In order to possess the virtue of ''Samatvam'', he will also need to dedicate himself to steadying the mind every moment of his yoga career..."&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 3, "The Pathway to Samatvam", ''Samatvam: The Yoga of Equanimity'', Swami Sivananda Saraswati.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoga===
Another Sanskrit term for equanimity is ''[[Upeksha (Indian thought)|upekṣhā]]''. This is the term used by [[Patanjali]] in his ''[[Yoga Sutras]]'' (1.33),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Commentary on the Yoga Sutras|author=Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati|publisher=Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati|url=http://www.swamij.com/yoga-sutras-13339.htm#1.33|accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here ''upekṣhā'' is considered to be one of the [[Brahmavihara|four sublime attitudes]], along with [[Mettā|loving-kindness]] (''maitri''), [[Karuṇā|compassion]] (''karuṇā''), and [[mudita|joy]] (''mudita''). It is related to the idea of [[Vairagya]] or "dispassion". The Upeksha Yoga school foregrounds equanimity as the most important tenet of a [[yoga]] practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upekshayoga.com/yoga/Principles.html Upeksha yoga]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many [[Yoga]] traditions, the virtue of equanimity can be one of the results attained through regular [[meditation]], combined with regular practice of [[pranayama]], asanas and mental disciplines, which clear the mind and bring one inexorably toward a state of health and balance.

==Stoicism==
Equanimity is a central concept in [[Stoic ethics]] and psychology. The Greek stoics use the word ''[[apatheia]]'' or ''[[ataraxia]]'' whereas the Roman stoics used the Latin word ''aequanimitas''. The Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s ''[[Meditations]]'' detail a philosophy of service and duty, describing how to find and preserve equanimity in the midst of conflict by following nature as a source of guidance and inspiration. His adoptive father [[Antoninus Pius]]'s last word was uttered when the tribune of the night-watch came to ask him for the night's password — Pius decided upon "aequanimitas" (equanimity). {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Pyrrhonism==
In [[Pyrrhonism]] the term used for equanimity is ''[[ataraxia]]'', which means to be unperturbed. Ataraxia the goal of Pyrrhonist practice. 

==Buddhism==
In [[Buddhism]], [[upekkha|equanimity]] (''[[upekkhā]]'', ''upekṣhā'') is one of the [[Brahmavihara|four sublime attitudes]] and is considered:

{{quote|Neither a thought nor an emotion, it is rather the steady conscious realization of reality's transience. It is the ground for [[wisdom]] and [[free will|freedom]] and the protector of [[compassion]] and [[love]]. While some may think of equanimity as dry neutrality or cool aloofness, mature equanimity produces a radiance and warmth of being. The [[Buddha]] described a mind filled with equanimity as "abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill-will."|&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Equanimity|author=[[Gil Fronsdal]]|publisher=Insight Meditation Center|url=http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/articles/equanimity.html|date=2004-05-29|accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}Equanimity can also be cultivated through meditation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brahmana|first=Metteyya|date=2016-05-14|title=NEW EQUANIMITY MEDITATION AND TOOLS FROM PSYCHOLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE TO TEST ITS EFFECTIVENESS|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303111890_NEW_EQUANIMITY_MEDITATION_AND_TOOLS_FROM_PSYCHOLOGY_AND_NEUROSCIENCE_TO_TEST_ITS_EFFECTIVENESS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
Many Jewish thinkers highlight the importance of equanimity (Menuhat ha-Nefesh or Yishuv ha-Da'at) as a necessary foundation for moral and spiritual development.  The virtue of equanimity receives particular attention in the writings of rabbis such as [[Baal Shem Tov|Rabbi Yisroel Bal Shem Tov]] and [[Simcha Zissel Ziv|Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv]].

==Christianity==
[[Samuel Johnson]] defined equanimity as "evenness of mind, neither elated nor depressed." In [[Christian philosophy]], equanimity is considered essential for carrying out the [[theological virtues]] of [[gentleness]], [[contentment]], [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Twenty Essays on the Practical Improvement of God's Providential Dispensations as Means of Moral Discipline to the Christian|publisher=RB Seeley and W Burnside|page=51|year=1838|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lFwEAAAAQAAJ&amp;vq=Johnson&amp;dq=Equanimity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
The word “[[Islam]]” is derived from the [[Arabic]] word ''aslama'', which denotes the peace that comes from total surrender and acceptance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Islam|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A Muslim may experientially behold that everything happening is meant to be, and stems from the ultimate wisdom of God; hence, being a [[Muslim]] can therefore be understood to mean that one is in a state of equanimity.

==Baha'i Faith==
The voluminous Writings of the Baha'i Faith are filled with thousands of references to divine attributes, of which equanimity is one. Similar in intent and more frequently used than "equanimity" in the Baha'i Writings are "detachment" and "selflessness" which dispose human beings to free themselves from inordinate reactions to the changes and chances of the world. Humanity is called upon to show complete and sublime detachment from aught else but God, from all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, from the material world and from the promptings of their own interests and passions. Related concepts include faith, the concept of growing through suffering and being tested, fortitude under trials, dignity, patience, prudence, moderation, freedom from material things, radiant acquiescence, wisdom and evanescence.{{Original research inline|date=June 2018}} Baha'u'llah, the Central Personage of the Baha'i Faith, wrote: "Until a being setteth his foot in the plane of sacrifice, he is bereft of every favour and grace; and this plane of sacrifice is the realm of dying to the self, that the radiance of the living God may then shine forth. The martyr’s field is the place of detachment from self, that the anthems of eternity may be upraised. Do all ye can to become wholly weary of self, and bind yourselves to that Countenance of Splendours; and once ye have reached such heights of servitude, ye will find, gathered within your shadow, all created things. This is boundless grace; this is the highest sovereignty; this is the life that dieth not. All else save this is at the last but manifest perdition and great loss."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The highly revered Son of Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha, was an exile and prisoner along with His Father, for more than forty years facing a torrent of various hardships.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} It is written about him: "So imperturbable was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s equanimity that, while rumors were being bruited about that He might be cast into the sea, or exiled to Fizán in Tripolitania, or hanged on the gallows, He, to the amazement of His friends and the amusement of His enemies, was to be seen planting trees and vines in the garden of His house, whose fruits when the storm had blown over, He would bid His faithful gardener, Ismá’íl Áqá, pluck and present to those same friends and enemies on the occasion of their visits to Him."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} When in London He was asked about His time in prison and said: "Freedom is not a matter of place. It is a condition. I was thankful for the prison, and the lack of liberty was very pleasing to me, for those days were passed in the path of service, under the utmost difficulties and trials, bearing fruits and results...Unless one accepts dire vicissitudes, he will not attain...When one is released from the prison of self, that is indeed release, for that is the greater prison...The afflictions which come to humanity sometimes tend to centre the consciousness upon the limitations, and this is a veritable prison. Release comes by making of the will a Door through which the confirmations of the Spirit come."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Asked about this He said: The confirmations of the Spirit are all those powers and gifts which some are born with (and which men sometimes call genius), but for which others have to strive with infinite pains. They come to that man or woman who accepts his life with radiant acquiescence. Radiant acquiescence—that was the quality with which we all suddenly seemed inspired as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá bade us good-bye."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The following quote by 'Abdu'l-Baha offers a perspective aimed at cultivating equanimity.{{Original research inline|date=June 2018}} He wrote: "Grieve thou not over the troubles and hardships of this nether world, nor be thou glad in times of ease and comfort, for both shall pass away. This present life is even as a swelling wave, or a mirage, or drifting shadows. Could ever a distorted image on the desert serve as refreshing waters? No, by the Lord of Lords! Never can reality and the mere semblance of reality be one, and wide is the difference between fancy and fact, between truth and the phantom thereof. Know thou that the Kingdom is the real world, and this nether place is only its shadow stretching out. A shadow hath no life of its own; its existence is only a fantasy, and nothing more; it is but images reflected in water, and seeming as pictures to the eye. Rely upon God. Trust in Him. Praise Him, and call Him continually to mind. He verily turneth trouble into ease, and sorrow into solace, and toil into utter peace. He verily hath dominion over all things. If thou wouldst hearken to my words, release thyself from the fetters of whatsoever cometh to pass. Nay rather, under all conditions thank thou thy loving Lord, and yield up thine affairs unto His Will that worketh as He pleaseth. This verily is better for thee than all else, in either world." {{Citation needed|reason=Source must be directly cited and linked to as footnote|date=June 2018}}

In [[Greek philosophy]] '''''eupraxis''''', literally "right action", is a fundamental concept in [[ethics]], which has subtle meanings, suggesting an "ethical life-stance".  This is similar in meaning to [[eupraxsophy]], a word coined in the 20th century by [[secular humanist]] philosopher [[Paul Kurtz]].

A '''figure of thought''' ({{lang-la|figurae sententiarum}}, {{lang-el|schemata dianoias}}) is a [[rhetorical device]] sometimes distinguished from [[figure of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;Gideon O. Burton, [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Figures/Figures%20of%20Speech-Thought.htm "Figures of speech/figures of thought"], ''Silva Rhetoricae'', Brigham Young University&lt;/ref&gt; In another sense the term has been used in the study of diagrams and drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Dirmoser, [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-7091-0803-1_12#page-1 "Figures of Thought: The Use of Diagrams in Science and Art"], in "Drawing a Hypothesis", pp. 153-160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application to Latin literature==
It may be difficult to draw the distinction between figures of speech and figures of thought, especially when the primary area of inquiry is [[poetry]] rather than a prose composition, which adheres to the rules of rhetorical theory that were for the most part created in their fullest articulation in the age of [[Quintilian]] (c. 35 – c. 100). In their approach to language, the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poets ([[Horace]], [[Catullus]], [[Propertius]], [[Tibullus]]) did not distinguish between ''[[inventio]]'' and ''[[elocutio]]'', which explains somewhat our confusion between figures of thought and figures of speech. The latter are exemplified most immediately by conceptual substitutions, such as [[metaphor]] or [[synecdoche]], but if we consider not just the mere ''linguistic'' aspect of the substitution and focus most closely on the concepts themselves, then we may perceive the comprehensiveness of the conceptual for the poet, who operates with words to extend and amplify the potential semantics of poetic output.

==Uses of the term==
[[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] used the term in relation to the philosophy of [[Plato]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Plato’s dialectic makes continual use of figures of speech, which are really figures of thought."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studiesincomparativereligion.com/Public/articles/A_Figure_of_Speech_or_a_Figure_of_Thought_Part_1-by_Ananda_Coomaraswamy.aspx "A Figure of Speech, or a Figure of Thought?"], Studies in Comparative Religion, Vol. 6, No. 1, Winter 1972&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The scholar of [[Latin literature]] Gordon Williams (died 2010)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article2744529.ece "Gordon Williams: Scholar who introduced many to the pleasures of Latin poetry" (obituary)], The Times (London), 29 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; published a study titled ''Figures of Thought in Roman Poetry'' (1980), stating in the introduction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[[Language]] was subject to ordering by exhaustive description of vocabulary, syntax, and figures. The content was likewise subject to ordering by the rules of ''[[inventio]]'' (the technique by which all the latent or inherent possibilities in a given idea or cluster of ideas could be 'discovered' and exploited)."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A collection of drawings by Nikolaus Gansterer (2011) was titled "Drawing a Hypothesis: Figures of Thought".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.a-n.co.uk/reviews/drawing-a-hypothesis-figures-of-thought "Drawing a Hypothesis: Figures of thought"], a-n The Artists Information Company, 19 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Mutand dAguila Joan Castejon Wax on Paper 1982 100x81.jpg|thumb|220px|'Mutant eagle', wax on paper, by Joan Castejon.]]
The Grup d' Elx artists began their training in an precarious artistic scenario. Its activity was a task that built a bridge between modernity and vertebrate and radical vanguard, which for them was inseparable from a social transition out of the [[Francoist]] dictatorship.  In this sense, as the members of El Paso  or [[Dau al set]], the artists of the Grup d' Elx conducted an art in which there are several components that are part of a common denominator: primacy of intense expressiveness, intentional reduction of color to a minimum and, finally, the belief in an artistic poetics of engagement centered on human beings and their social situation. In fact, one of its most representative members, [[Joan Castejón]], was imprisoned for four years.&lt;ref name="Así era entonces."&gt;{{cite news

The group was inspired by the activity of other postwar artistic groups such as [[Dau al Set]] and [[Grup Parpalló]]. Members of Grup d'Elx included [[Joan Castejón]], Albert Agulló, Antoni Coll y Sixto Marco.

The group dissolved in 1973.

'''Hospitality''' refers to the relationship between a guest and a host, wherein the host receives the guest with goodwill, including the reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers. Louis, chevalier de Jaucourt describes hospitality in the Encyclopédie as the virtue of a great soul that cares for the whole universe through the ties of humanity.&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net"&gt;Jaucourt, Louis, chevalier de. "Hospitality." The Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert Collaborative Translation Project. Translated by Sophie Bourgault. Ann Arbor: Michigan Publishing, University of Michigan Library, 2013. Web. [fill in today's date in the form 18 Apr. 2009 and remove square brackets]. &lt;http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.did2222.0002.761&gt;. Trans. of "Hospitalité," Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, vol. 8. Paris, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hospitality ethics''' is a discipline that studies this usage of hospitality.

==Etymology ==
Derives from the Latin ''hospes'',&lt;ref&gt;C. Lewis, Elementary Latin Dictionary (Oxford Univ. Press, 2000), p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "host", "guest", or "stranger". ''Hospes'' is formed from ''hostis'', which means "stranger" or "enemy" (the latter being where terms like "hostile" derive). By [[metonymy]] the Latin word 'Hospital' means a guest-chamber, guest's lodging, an inn.&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's Latin Dictionary, revised by Marchant, J &amp; Charles J., 260th. Thousand&lt;/ref&gt; Hospes/hostis is thus the root for the English words [[Wikt:host|host]], hospitality, hospice, hostel and hotel.

==Historical practice==
In ancient cultures hospitality involved welcoming the stranger and offering him food, shelter, and safety.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3uCAshDkca8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Hospitality&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9tN7fnevRAhUIfiYKHdKIBqgQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Hospitality&amp;f=false Pohl, Christine D., ''Making Room: Recovering Hospitality as a Christian Tradition'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1999] {{ISBN|9780802844316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global concepts==

===Ancient Greece===
In [[Ancient Greece]], hospitality was a right, with the host being expected to make sure the needs of his guests were met. The ancient Greek term ''[[Xenia (Greek)|xenia]]'', or ''theoxenia'' when a god was involved, expressed this ritualized guest-friendship relation. In Greek society a person's ability to abide by the laws of hospitality determined nobility and social standing. The Stoics regarded hospitality as a duty inspired by Zeus himself.&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net"/&gt;

===India and Nepal===
In [[India]] and [[Nepal]] hospitality is based on the principle ''[[Atithi Devo Bhav]]a'', meaning "the guest is God". This principle is shown in a number of stories where a guest is revealed to be a god who rewards the provider of hospitality. From this stems the Indian or Nepal practice of graciousness towards guests at home and in all social situations. The ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]],'' an ancient [[Indian literature|Indian work]] on [[ethics]] and [[morality]], explains the ethics of hospitality through its verses 81 through 90, dedicating a separate chapter on it (Chapter 9).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm Tirukkuṛaḷ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216064046/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm |date=2014-12-16 }} verses 71-80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf | title=Thirukkural English Translation and Commentary | publisher=W.H. Allen, &amp; Co | first = GU |last = Pope &lt;!--| authorlink=Thirukkural English Translation--&gt; | year=1886 | pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
[[File:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 002.jpg|thumb|Mosaic at [[Basilica of San Vitale|San Vitale, Ravenna]], Abraham and the angels, pre-547]]
Judaism praises hospitality to strangers and guests based largely on the examples of [[Abraham]] and [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] in the [[Book of Genesis]] ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|18:1–8|HE}} and {{Bibleverse-nb||Genesis|19:1–8|HE}}). In Hebrew, the practice is called ''hachnasat orchim'', or "welcoming guests". Besides other expectations, hosts are expected to provide nourishment, comfort, and entertainment for their guests,&lt;ref name="Kagan 1888 284"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kagan|first=Yisrael Meir|title=Ahavath chesed : the Love of Kindness|date=1888|publisher=Feldheim|location=Warsaw|isbn=0873061675|page=284|edition=2nd, rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the end of the visit, hosts customarily escort their guests out of their home, wishing them a safe journey.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud Sotah, 46B&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
In [[Christianity]], hospitality is a [[Theological virtues|virtue]] which is a reminder of sympathy for strangers and a rule to welcome visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Montandon, ''L'hospitalité au XVIIIe siècle'', Presses Universitaires Blaise Pascal, France, 2000, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; This is a virtue found in the Old Testament, with, for example, the custom of the [[foot washing]] of visitors or the [[kiss of peace]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter A. Elwell, ''Evangelical Dictionary of Theology'', Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 458&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Cunningham, Keith J. Egan, ''Christian Spirituality: Themes from the Tradition'', Paulist Press, USA, 1996, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; It was taught by [[Jesus]] in the New Testament. Indeed, Jesus said that those who had welcomed a stranger had welcomed him.&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Baker, ''Hospitality and World Politics'', Springer, UK, 2013, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Some Western countries have developed a host culture for immigrants, based on the [[bible]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Olaf Kleist, Irial Glynn, ''History, Memory and Migration: Perceptions of the Past and the Politics of Incorporation'', Palgrave Macmillan, USA, 2012, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pashtun===
One of the main principles of [[Pashtunwali]] is [[Melmastia]]. This is the display of hospitality and profound respect to all visitors (regardless of race, religion, national affiliation or economic status) without any hope of remuneration or favour. [[Pashtuns]] will go to great lengths to show their hospitality.&lt;ref name="Banting"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Afghanistan the People |last1=Banting |first1=Erinn |authorlink=|volume=|year=2003|publisher=Crabtree Publishing Company |location=|isbn=0-7787-9335-4|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fl8cd15sc7wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22Erinn%20Banting%22&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
Islam highly recommends one another to say peace be upon you [[salam Wa Alaikum]] to one another as Muhammad had said,
Muslims are obliged to treat their guest with kindness and peace even prisoners (in war), As Muhammad had said in authentic sources and verses from the Quran

[[Abu Aziz ibn Umair]] reported: I was among the prisoners of war on the day of the [[battle of Badr]]. Muhammad had said, “I enjoin you to treat the captives well.” After I accepted Islam, I was among the [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]] (Inhabitants of [[Madinah]]) and when the time of lunch or dinner arrived, I would feed dates to the prisoners for I had been fed bread due to the command of Muhammad. [[al-Mu’jam al-Kabīr 18444]]

Invite (all) to the Way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious: [[16:125]] Quran

Good hospitality is crucial in Islam even in business According to another report, Muhammad passed by a pile of food in the market. He put his hand inside it and felt dampness, although the surface was dry. He said:
“O owner of the food, what is this?’
The man said, ‘It was damaged by rain, O Messenger of God.’
He said, ‘Why did you not put the rain-damaged food on top so that people could see it!  Whoever cheats us is not one of us.” ([[Saheeh Muslim]])

===Celtic cultures===
Celtic societies also valued the concept of hospitality, especially in terms of protection. A host who granted a person's request for refuge was expected not only to provide food and shelter for his/her guest, but to make sure they did not come to harm while under their care.&lt;ref&gt;Charles MacKinnon, ''Scottish Highlanders'' (1984, [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] Books); page 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current usage==
In the West today hospitality is rarely a matter of protection and survival and is more associated with [[etiquette]] and [[entertainment]]. However, it still involves showing respect for one's guests, providing for their needs, and treating them as equals. Cultures and subcultures vary in the extent to which one is expected to show hospitality to strangers, as opposed to personal friends or members of one's [[ingroup]].

===Anthropology of hospitality===
[[Jacques Derrida]] offers a model to understand hospitality that divides unconditional hospitality from conditional hospitality. Over the centuries, philosophers have devoted considerable attention to the problem of hospitality.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, J. (2000). “Hospitality”.  Angelaki: Journal of Theoretical Humanities,5(3), 3-18.&lt;/ref&gt; However, hospitality offers a paradoxical situation (like language) since inclusion of those who are welcomed in the sacred law of hospitality implies others will be rejected. Julia Kristeva (1991) alerts readers to the dangers of “perverse hospitality”, which consists of taking advantage of the vulnerability of aliens to dispossess them.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, J. (1991). Extranjeros para nosotros mismos, trad. de X. Gispert, Barcelona, Plaza &amp; Janes Editores (Hombre y Sociedad).&lt;/ref&gt; Hospitality serves to reduce the tension in the process of host-guest encounters, producing a liminal zone that combines curiosity about others and fear of strangers.&lt;ref&gt;Graburn, N. H. (1983). “The anthropology of tourism”. Annals of tourism research, 10(1), 9-33.&lt;/ref&gt; In general terms, the meaning of hospitality centres on the belief that strangers should be assisted and protected while traveling.&lt;ref&gt;Lashley, C. (1995). Towards an understanding of employee empowerment in hospitality services. International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 7(1), 27-32.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all voices are in agreement with this concept. Professor [[Anthony Pagden]] describes how the concept of hospitality was historically manipulated to legitimate the conquest of Americas by imposing the right of free transit, which was conducive to the formation of the modern nation-state. This suggests that hospitality is a political institution which can be ideologically deformed to oppress others.&lt;ref&gt;Pagden, A. (1995). Lords of all the worlds: ideologies of empire in Spain, Britain and France c. 1500-c. 1850. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''immigrant paradox''' is that recent [[Immigrant generations|immigrants]] often outperform more established immigrants and non-immigrants on a number of health-, education-, and conduct- or crime-related outcomes, despite the numerous barriers they face to successful social integration.&lt;ref&gt;

According to the UN, the number of first-generation [[Immigration|immigrants worldwide]] is 244&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimates15.shtml|title=United Nations Population Division {{!}} Department of Economic and Social Affairs|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
These large-scale population changes worldwide have led many scholars, across fields, to study the [[acculturation]] and adjustment of immigrants to their new homes. Specifically, researchers have examined immigrant experiences as they pertain to [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]], [[Mental health|mental]] and [[Health|physical]] health, and conduct/crime.

Researchers have tried to understand why later generations seem to perform less well than their forebears. They have found that it can be explained by non-optimal [[methodology]] and differences in the way generations are modified by the host culture.

== Challenges facing immigrants ==
Immigrants face many challenges as a result of migration, stemming from the fact that the nations and communities they settle in are culturally unfamiliar. As a result, they find themselves in an unwelcoming environment lacking in the infrastructure necessary to ensure a simple transition. Additionally, because general attitudes of the host society are often hostile and xenophobic,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schneider|first=S.

Discrimination and prejudice are common and dictate daily experiences with individuals and organizations within the host society. For example, although cultural sensitivity training is increasingly a required component of medical education, immigrants have historically faced and continue to face discrimination in the health care system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lauderdale|first=Diane S.|last2=Wen|first2=Ming|last3=Jacobs|first3=Elizabeth A.|last4=Kandula|first4=Namratha R.|title=Immigrant Perceptions of Discrimination in Health Care|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00005650-200610000-00005|journal=Medical Care|volume=44|issue=10|pages=914–920|doi=10.1097/01.mlr.0000220829.87073.f7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An added barrier to equitable access to health care comes as a result of many immigrants' limited English proficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woloshin|first=Steven|date=1995-03-01|title=Language Barriers in Medicine in the United States|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.1995.03520330054037|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=273|issue=9|doi=10.1001/jama.1995.03520330054037|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many health care facilities have inadequate interpretation services, and culturally sensitive health care providers are also scarce. What's more, many immigrants are uninsured,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cis.org/Fact-Sheet/Facts-Immigration-and-Health-Insurance|title=Facts on Immigration and Health Insurance|website=CIS.org|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carrasquillo|first=O|last2=Carrasquillo|first2=A I|last3=Shea|first3=S|date=June 2000|title=Health insurance coverage of immigrants living in the United States: differences by citizenship status and country of origin.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=90|issue=6|pages=917–923|issn=0090-0036|pmc=1446276|pmid=10846509}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the financial burdens of adequate health care insurmountable.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Many immigrants also settle in ''de facto'' segregated, low-income neighborhoods and [[ethnic enclave]]s, especially during periods of high immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iceland|first=John|last2=Scopilliti|first2=Melissa|date=2008-02-01|title=Immigrant residential segregation in U.S. metropolitan areas, 1990–2000|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1353/dem.2008.0009|journal=Demography|volume=45|issue=1|pages=79–94|doi=10.1353/dem.2008.0009|issn=0070-3370|pmc=2831378}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the benefits of living in such communities include increased social support, positive in-group relations, and the virtual elimination of cultural and language barriers in daily interaction, often such neighborhoods are targets of institutional violence, such as [[Frisking|stop and frisk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gelman|first=Andrew|last2=Fagan|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Kiss|first3=Alex|date=2007-09-01|title=An Analysis of the New York City Police Department's "Stop-and-Frisk" Policy in the Context of Claims of Racial Bias|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1198/016214506000001040|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume=102|issue=479|pages=813–823|doi=10.1198/016214506000001040|issn=0162-1459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, due to public education funding policies in the United States, funds are often allocated to schools based on neighborhood property taxes. As a result, many immigrant children attend schools that are understaffed, underfunded, and lacking in resources in comparison to the schools of their more affluent peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/02/concentration-poverty-american-schools/471414/|title=Students of Color Are Much More Likely to Attend Schools Where Most of Their Peers Are Poor|last=Brownstein|first=Janie Boschma and Ronald|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/08/property-taxes-and-unequal-schools/497333/|title=Good School, Rich School; Bad School, Poor School|last=Semuels|first=Alana|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as the opportunity gap, by which low-income and marginalized groups have disproportionately low access to the opportunities and conveniences afforded to societally privileged groups, resulting in group-wide disparities in academic achievement, wages, and political power. In direct relation to these obstacles, immigrants also face challenges in the workplace, including poor and dangerous working conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ORRENIUS|first=PIA M.|last2=ZAVODNY|first2=MADELINE|date=August 2009|title=Do Immigrants Work In Riskier Jobs?|journal=Demography|volume=46|issue=3|pages=535–551|issn=0070-3370|pmc=2831347|pmid=19771943}}&lt;/ref&gt; unemployment, and the employment of highly skilled individuals in low-skill jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dean|first=Jennifer Asanin|last2=Wilson|first2=Kathi|date=2009-04-01|title=‘Education?

To compound all of these issues, the burden of acculturation is an added stressor. Navigating the divide between the heritage culture and the culture of the new society is difficult, as the traditions, beliefs, and norms of these two cultures are often in direct conflict. This challenge is only compounded by the other obstacles immigrants are faced with, and has deleterious consequences for mental health,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sirin|first=Selcuk R.|last2=Ryce|first2=Patrice|last3=Gupta|first3=Taveeshi|last4=Rogers-Sirin|first4=Lauren|title=The role of acculturative stress on mental health symptoms for immigrant adolescents: A longitudinal investigation.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0028398|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=49|issue=4|pages=736–748|doi=10.1037/a0028398}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly because many migrants and refugees are already susceptible to elevated levels of [[psychopathology]], due to the trauma associated with interpersonal conflict, acculturative stress and/or political unrest in their countries of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mobasher|first=Mohsen|date=2016-07-27|title=Cultural Trauma and Ethnic Identity Formation Among Iranian Immigrants in the United States|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0002764206289656|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=50|issue=1|pages=100–117|doi=10.1177/0002764206289656}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaltman|first=Stacey|last2=Green|first2=Bonnie L.|last3=Mete|first3=Mihriye|last4=Shara|first4=Nawar|last5=Miranda|first5=Jeanne|title=Trauma, depression, and comorbid PTSD/depression in a community sample of Latina immigrants.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0018952|journal=Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy|volume=2|issue=1|pages=31–39|doi=10.1037/a0018952|pmc=2850073}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steel|first=Zachary|last2=Silove|first2=Derrick|last3=Bird|first3=Kevin|last4=McGorry|first4=Patrick|last5=Mohan|first5=P.|date=1999-07-01|title=Pathways from War Trauma to Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms Among Tamil Asylum Seekers, Refugees, and Immigrants|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024710902534|journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress|volume=12|issue=3|pages=421–435|doi=10.1023/A:1024710902534|issn=0894-9867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of these obstacles, it is expected that recent immigrants would have outcomes inferior to those of their native-born or non-immigrant peers.

== Paradoxical findings ==
Despite the numerous challenges facing early generation immigrants, research on the mental and physical health, educational, and conduct-related outcomes of these populations has demonstrated a [[paradoxical]] pattern.

=== Mental health outcomes ===
Research with Filipino Americans has demonstrated that first-generation immigrants had lower levels of depressive symptoms than subsequent, US-born generations.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; First-generation Mexican immigrants to the United States were found to have lower incidences of mood disorders and substance use than their bicultural or subsequent generation counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burnam|first=M.

These findings have been replicated outside of the United States, with Canadian researchers finding that foreign born youth are less likely to display emotional and behavioural problems than their native-born peers, despite experiencing similar levels of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beiser|first=Morton|last2=Hou|first2=Feng|last3=Hyman|first3=Ilene|last4=Tousignant|first4=Michel|date=2002-02-01|title=Poverty, Family Process, and the Mental Health of Immigrant Children in Canada|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.92.2.220|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=92|issue=2|pages=220–227|doi=10.2105/AJPH.92.2.220|issn=0090-0036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted in the Netherlands has also found evidence of an immigrant paradox, with first- and second-generation Muslim immigrants reporting fewer psychological problems and higher self-esteem than Dutch nationals.

=== Physical health outcomes ===
The immigrant paradox also extends to physical health, with recent immigrants having better outcomes than US-born individuals. One study of several thousand health records in Southern California found Asian and Latina women had better perinatal outcomes than both white and Black women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Voelker|first=Rebecca|date=1994-12-21|title=Born in the USA: Infant Health Paradox|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.1994.03520230015006|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=272|issue=23|doi=10.1001/jama.1994.03520230015006|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Asian and Latina women had lower infant mortality, higher birth weight, fewer [[Caesarean section]]s, fewer medical diagnoses during delivery, and shorter hospitalizations.

With respect to overweight and obesity, it has been found that first-generation Mexican American women had healthier diets than both non-Latino whites and second-generation Mexican American women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guendelman|first=S|last2=Abrams|first2=B|date=1995-01-01|title=Dietary intake among Mexican-American women: generational differences and a comparison with white non-Hispanic women.|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.85.1.20|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=85|issue=1|pages=20–25|doi=10.2105/ajph.85.1.20|issn=0090-0036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, second-generation women had the poorest dietary intake, consuming even smaller amounts of necessary nutrients than non-Latina white women.

== A special case: the immigrant paradox in refugees? ==
There is a general consensus that [[refugee]]s are at a particular disadvantage when it comes to successful [[Third country resettlement|resettlement]] in the host society, as the same [[Immigrant paradox#Challenges facing immigrants|challenges]] voluntary immigrants face are generally aggravated for refugees. However, some research has found evidence of a paradox, with refugees at least three times less likely to engage in substance use than non-immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salas-Wright|first=Christopher P.|last2=Vaughn|first2=Michael G.|title=A "refugee paradox" for substance use disorders?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0376871614009168|journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence|volume=142|pages=345–349|doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.06.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has found refugees to Denmark to have a lower likelihood of stroke and breast cancer compared to Danish natives, but higher likelihood of lung cancer, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norredam|first=Marie|last2=Agyemang|first2=Charles|last3=Hoejbjerg Hansen|first3=Oluf K.|last4=Petersen|first4=Jørgen H.|last5=Byberg|first5=Stine|last6=Krasnik|first6=Allan|last7=Kunst|first7=Anton E.|date=2014-08-01|title=Duration of residence and disease occurrence among refugees and family reunited immigrants: test of the ‘healthy migrant effect’ hypothesis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tmi.12340/abstract|journal=Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health|volume=19|issue=8|pages=958–967|doi=10.1111/tmi.12340|issn=1365-3156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, levels of all of these diseases among refugee populations eventually converged to the same levels as Danish natives with increased length of residency.

There may also be an immigrant paradox for the perinatal outcomes of refugees, with the majority of refugee women studied having a lower [[Birth rate|crude birth rate]], infant mortality rate, maternal mortality rate, and percentage of low birth weight than women in both their host country and their country of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hynes|first=Michelle|date=2002-08-07|title=Reproductive Health Indicators and Outcomes Among Refugee and Internally Displaced Persons in Postemergency Phase Camps|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.288.5.595|journal=JAMA|volume=288|issue=5|doi=10.1001/jama.288.5.595|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflicting evidence ==
There is some doubt among scholars as to whether or not the phenomenon actually exists, with some findings conflicting with the body of research on immigrant outcomes. For example, among Asian Americans, [[limited English proficiency]] was consistently associated with worse physical and mental health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; In addition to language proficiency, age at time of immigration is also an important factor, with older first-generation Mexican American youth more likely to drop out of school than their US-born and younger, first-generation counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landale|first=Nancy S.|last2=Oropesa|first2=R.S.|last3=Llanes|first3=Daniel|title=Schooling, Work, and Idleness among Mexican and Non-Latino White Adolescents|url=https://doi.org/10.1006/ssre.1998.0631|journal=Social Science Research|volume=27|issue=4|pages=457–480|doi=10.1006/ssre.1998.0631}}&lt;/ref&gt; In further support of this conclusion, data from the [[Current Population Survey|CPS]] shows that immigrating as a teenager is associated with completing less schooling than immigrating before or after adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiswick|first=Barry R.|last2=DebBurman|first2=Noyna|date=2004-08-01|title=Educational attainment: analysis by immigrant generation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775703001043|journal=Economics of Education Review|series=Special Issue In Honor of Lewis C.

== Explanations ==

=== Acculturation and the erosion of protective factors ===
The most common hypothesis for the immigrant paradox considers recent and first-generation immigrants' comparative access to cultural and social protective factors. Despite being confronted with the many challenges arising from immigration and acculturation, first-generation immigrants have greater social and cultural capital than subsequent generations. These include stronger social networks and highly adaptive cultural practices concerning religion, diet, substance use, and parenting style.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-71943-6_7|title=Latinas/os in the United States: Changing the Face of América|last=Acevedo-Garcia|first=Dolores|last2=Bates|first2=Lisa M.|date=2008|publisher=Springer, Boston, MA|isbn=9780387719412|pages=101–113|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-71943-6_7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harker|first=Kathryn|date=2000–2001|title=Immigrant Generation, Assimilation, and Adolescent Psychological Well-Being|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/josf79&amp;div=42&amp;g_sent=1&amp;casa_token=uMlrSOoLQo4AAAAA:BVv50TMN4gEYETcl44cdzUNOydpsNfMnlkLWcDcA-hsH2xnZm4f79JrvKr_-F0vj4jzxycA&amp;collection=journals|journal=Social Forces|volume=79|pages=969–1004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers also posit that first-generation immigrants are more likely to place high importance upon academic success due to fear of limited employment opportunities in the host society.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Angel L.|last2=Jamison|first2=Kenneth M.|last3=Trujillo|first3=Monica H.|title=Disparities in the Educational Success of Immigrants: An Assessment of the Immigrant Effect for Asians and Latinos|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0002716208322765|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=620|issue=1|pages=90–114|doi=10.1177/0002716208322765}}&lt;/ref&gt; These protective factors result in superior lifetime health, educational, financial, and conduct-related outcomes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Additionally, by having access to multiple cultural frameworks, recent immigrants are able to [[Code-switching|code-switch]] between frameworks or engage in downward [[Social comparison theory|social comparison]] as methods of self-protection.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suárez-Orozco|first=Carola|last2=Carhill|first2=Avary|date=2008-09-01|title=Afterword: New directions in research with immigrant families and their children|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cd.224/abstract|journal=New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development|volume=2008|issue=121|pages=87–104|doi=10.1002/cd.224|issn=1534-8687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, subsequent generations may not have access to such social and cultural capital, having been socialized into the norms and expectations of the host society (i.e., consuming more processed and unhealthy foods, having a smaller network of same-ethnicity peers, increased substance use). Further, intergenerational conflict is more likely between first-generation immigrants and their second-generation children due to differing cultural practices, with parents being accustomed to the norms of their culture of origin and children having been socialized into the norms of the host society.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This type of conflict has been linked to poorer outcomes for children.

A third cost of acculturation is linked to immigrant children's cultural [[Socialization#Racial socialization|socialization]]. A strong sense of ethnic identity and pride in one's cultural heritage is generally understood to be protective from negative mental health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mossakowski|first=Krysia N.|date=2003|title=Coping with Perceived Discrimination: Does Ethnic Identity Protect Mental Health?|jstor=1519782|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|volume=44|issue=3|pages=318–331|doi=10.2307/1519782}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with increased length of stay in the host society, subsequent generations are likely to report decreasing levels of involvement in culturally important traditions and practices. With this comes decreasing strength of ethnic identity. Second-generation immigrants are also less likely to endorse meritocratic views, which is similarly correlated with decreasing strength of ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiley|first=Shaun|last2=Deaux|first2=Kay|last3=Hagelskamp|first3=Carolin|title=Born in the USA: How immigrant generation shapes meritocracy and its relation to ethnic identity and collective action.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0027661|journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology|volume=18|issue=2|pages=171–180|doi=10.1037/a0027661}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attributes are all associated with poorer mental health.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duffey|first=Thelma|last2=Somody|first2=Catherine|date=2011-07-05|title=The Role of Relational-Cultural Theory in Mental Health Counseling|url=https://doi.org/10.17744/mehc.33.3.c10410226u275647|journal=Journal of Mental Health Counseling|volume=33|issue=3|pages=223–242|doi=10.17744/mehc.33.3.c10410226u275647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Possible benefits of ethnic enclaves ====

First-generation immigrants often settle in ethnic enclaves, which carry a host of advantages. Residents of these neighborhoods have access to a strong and supportive network of same-ethnicity peers and potential access to culturally sensitive healthcare providers that may allow for increased financial gain and better physical and mental health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazumdar|first=Sanjoy|last2=Mazumdar|first2=Shampa|last3=Docuyanan|first3=Faye|last4=McLaughlin|first4=Colette Marie|date=|title=Creating a sense of place: the Vietnamese-Americans and Little Saigon|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272494400901701|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|volume=20|issue=4|pages=319–333|doi=10.1006/jevp.2000.0170|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Joshua S.|last2=Kagawa-Singer|first2=Marjorie|date=2007-07-30|title=Increasing Access to Care for Cultural and Linguistic Minorities: Ethnicity-Specific Health Care Organizations and Infrastructure|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/218627|journal=Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved|volume=18|issue=3|pages=532–549|doi=10.1353/hpu.2007.0073|issn=1548-6869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barry R.|first=Chiswick|last2=Miller|first2=Paul W.|date=2005-03-01|title=Do Enclaves Matter in Immigrant Adjustment?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1535-6841.2005.00101.x/abstract|journal=City &amp; Community|volume=4|issue=1|pages=5–35|doi=10.1111/j.1535-6841.2005.00101.x|issn=1540-6040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic enclaves also eliminate the challenges associated with language barriers, with residents often sharing linguistic similarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauer|first=Thomas|last2=Epstein|first2=Gil S.|last3=Gang|first3=Ira N.|date=2005-11-01|title=Enclaves, language, and the location choice of migrants|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-005-0009-z|journal=Journal of Population Economics|volume=18|issue=4|pages=649–662|doi=10.1007/s00148-005-0009-z|issn=0933-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthy immigrant selection ===
Another common explanation for the immigrant paradox is that the vast majority of superior outcomes among early generations of immigrants can be accounted for by a selection effect. Proponents of this hypothesis argue that only the most psychologically and physically healthy individuals migrate from their country of origin, and therefore have superior outcomes to begin with.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Methodological concerns ===
Much of the literature on the immigrant paradox in mental health relies on self-report data. This may be problematic in that certain populations may differentially interpret questions in ways that are meaningful and result in significant disparities between groups.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Similarly, many measures view mental health solely through a Western lens, accounting only for the types of symptoms commonly expressed in Western societies.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; This may result in the underreporting of poor mental health among non-Western populations.

Another issue in research on immigrants is the grouping of highly diverse ethnic groups together in monolithic racial categories,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; namely the pan-ethnic "Asian" and "Latino" categories. Much of the research on Latinos and the immigrant paradox has been conducted with Mexican American populations, ignoring the fact that there are 32 other countries that fall under the Latin American label. Similarly, much research on Asian Americans has been conducted with [[East Asia]]n populations, ignoring the differential treatment and experiences of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]]ns, and the different refugee status of individuals across Asia (examples include [[Bhutanese refugees|Lhotshampa]] refugees, who are of South Asian heritage, and Cambodian refugees, who are of Southeast Asian heritage). Such groupings are problematic in that they erase the large diversity in [[socioeconomic status]], educational background, and historical trauma of each of these ethnic groups – factors which all contribute to the consequent positive or negative outcomes of immigrants.

== Future directions in immigrant research ==
Carola Suárez-Orozco, Ph.D. calls for increased research on the psychology of immigrants paying attention to differences in refugee status, documentation status, gender, and ethnic group (in lieu of using pan-ethnic groupings).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Research must also consider seasonal migrants, the differential [[racialization]] of ethnic groups, and the role of English proficiency on educational and health outcomes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16727">'''Incorporeal''' or '''uncarnate''' means without a [[physical body]], [[Metaphysics of presence|presence]] or [[Shape|form]]. It is often used in reference to [[souls]], [[spirit]]s, and [[God]] in many [[religion]]s including [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]. In [[ancient philosophy]], any attenuated "thin" matter such as [[air]], [[aether (classical element)|aether]], [[fire]] or [[light]] was considered incorporeal.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. [https://archive.org/stream/matterandspirit01prieuoft#page/212/mode/2up Disquisitions of Matter and Spirit]. p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greeks believed [[air (classical element)|air]], as opposed to solid [[earth (classical element)|earth]], to be incorporeal, in so far as it is less resistant to movement; and the ancient Persians believed [[fire (classical element)|fire]] to be incorporeal in that every soul was said to be produced from it.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. [https://archive.org/stream/matterandspirit01prieuoft#page/232/mode/2up Disquisitions of Matter and Spirit]. p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; In modern philosophy, a distinction between the incorporeal and immaterial is not necessarily maintained: a body is described as incorporeal if it is not made out of matter.

In the [[problem of universals]], universals are separable from any particular embodiment in one sense, while in another, they seem inherent nonetheless. Aristotle offered a [[hylomorphic]] account of abstraction in contrast to Plato's world of [[Theory of Forms|Forms]]. Aristotle used the Greek terms ''[[wikt:somatic|soma]]'' (body) and ''[[hyle]]'' (matter, literally "wood").

The notion that a causally effective incorporeal body is even coherent requires the belief that something can affect what's material, without physically existing at the point of effect. A ball can directly affect another ball by coming in direct contact with it, and is visible because it reflects the light that directly reaches it. An incorporeal field of influence, or immaterial body could not perform these functions because they have no physical construction with which to perform these functions. Following Newton, it became customary to accept [[action at a distance]] as brute fact, and to overlook the philosophical problems involved in so doing.

==In theology==
[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|thumb|[[Plato]] depicted by Raphael.]]
{{quote|As early as Xenophanes (ca. 565-470 BC)... we find at least a tendency towards monotheism: "One god, greatest among gods and men, in no way similar to mortals either in body or in thought"... [He posits] a god who is the cause of all: "Always he remains in the same place, moving not at all: nor is it fitting for him to go to different places at different times... but without toil he shakes all things by the thought of his mind"...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In ''Physics'' VIII,5, [Aristotle] speaks favorably of Anaxagoras' Mind in so far as it is "impassive and unmixed [with the world]"... How can Aristotle have held both that God is immanent and also "impassive and unmixed"? Much of his argument depends on an analogy drawn from geometry. Just as the primary locus of power and influence in a rotating sphere is its central axis, which, although it moves (transitively) the other parts of the sphere, remains quite still, so also the unmoved mover remains majestically impassive even while being the very source of the activity of the universe (''Physics'' VIII,9,265b7-8)... Aristotle rejects the notion that God might think of something other than himself precisely because this would be to diminish his power (''Metaphysics'' XII,9,1074b34). The power that Aristotle is concerned about is the power whereby God has an effect in the world (''Metaphysics'' XII,6,1071b12-32). (In ''Physics'' VIII,5, Aristotle also says of Anaxagoras' Mind that "it could only cause motion the way it does being unmoved, and it can only ''rule'' being unmixed" -- 256b26-7: emphasis added.) So, we must conceive of God's thoughts about himself as bound up with his immanency (''Metaphysics'' I,2,983a8-10, III,4,1000b3-6). Aristotle offers an explanation of how this works: just as our (internal) intentions ''are'' their external objects less their matter, so God thinks himself in the things that depend on him (''Metaphysics'' XII,9,1047b38-a5: also ''De Anima'' III,5,430a-19-20). The interpretation of Thomas Aquinas would appear then to be correct, that it is precisely in thinking of himself that God knows—and controls—all other things...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=C. |last=Taliaferro |first2=P. |last2=Draper |first3=P.L. |last3=Quinn |year=2010 |title=A Companion to Philosophy of Religion |series=Blackwell Companions to Philosophy |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781405163576 |lccn=2009037505 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSCx-67Tk6cC&amp;pg=PA84 |pages=84, 87}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Kevin L. Flannery|"Ancient Philosophical Theology" in ''A Companion to Philosophy of Religion''}}

In chapter 10 of ''De ratione animae'', Alcuin defines ''anima'' (soul) by combining Platonic attributes, including intellect and reason, ceaseless motion and immortality with the Christian tenents of free will and salvation. As a means of interaction with corporeals such as the human body and incorporeals such as God and the Forms, his definition includes traits pertaining to the soul as an incarnate entity within the natural world.&lt;ref name="Lockett2011"/&gt;
{{quote|It is one thing to assert that the soul is 'incorporeal' insofar as it is distinct from the human body, and it is quite another thing to espouse the Platonic notion that the soul is utterly incorporeal, or that it is not a body of any kind. Platonic incorporeals differ significantly from the incorporeals of classical Stoicism, which were thought to participate in a diminished form of existence, and from the ''incorporalia'' of the grammatical tradition, which were defined on the basis of their imperceptibility to one or more of the five senses... A Platonic incorporeal is necessarily imperceptible to all the senses, and it does not occupy space. Accordingly, Alcuin writes that the soul is 'invisible, incorporeal, without weight, without colour,' although for a reader who already shared Alcuin's Platonic understanding of incorporeals, the mention of invisibility, weightlessness, and colourlessness was redundant. Alcuin also carefully specifies that the soul is circumscribed but nonetheless whole in every part of the body. In other words, the soul is neither diffused throughout the universe as God is or as a world-soul would be, nor is it distributed throughout a space in such a way that it can be divided.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If incorporeality makes the soul imperceptible to the senses, it is even more important that incorporeality allows the soul to apprehend other things that are imperceptible to the senses. The idea that like perceives like goes back to the Greek Presocratics, and in the medieval Latin iterations, it did not have to carry strictly Platonic connotations. Yet principally from Augustine's early dialogues and ''De Trinitate'', Alcuin and other Carolingian thinkers inherited many rational demonstrations of theological doctrines, worked out according to a method of argumentation that combined Neoplatonist metaphysics with Aristotelian logic. Within this mode of discourse, it was exceedingly useful to have recourse to the concept of true incorporeality, and to be able to attribute true incorporeality to the unitary, rational ''anima'', with all of the ontological and epistemological implications that it entails.&lt;ref name="Lockett2011"&gt;{{cite book |first=L. |last=Lockett |year=2011 |title=Anglo-Saxon Psychologies in the Vernacular and Latin Traditions |series=Toronto Anglo-Saxon Series |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=9781442642171 |lccn=2011378491 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMVycdqSh28C&amp;pg=PA288 |pages=287–289}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Leslie Lockett|"Why Must the Soul Be Incorporeal?" in ''Anglo-Saxon Psychologies in the Vernacular and Latin Traditions''}}

{{quote|Traditional forms of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam each conceive of God as an immaterial, nonphysical reality. If "the incorporeality of God" means the denial that God is physical, then all three monotheistic religions accept the incorporeality of God. However, if we follow the etymology of the term and define "incoporeality" as "without body" (from the Latin ''incorporale''), Christianity takes exception to a strict adherence to belief in God's incorporeality when it comes to the Incarnation. According to traditional Christianity, in the Incarnation, the second member of the Trinity... became infleshed (the Latin meaning of ''incarnatus'') and thus, in a sense, came to be "with body." While this pivotal claim about the union of God and man at the heart of Christianity marks a dramatic departure from a radical transcendent theology of God according to which any such union is metaphysically impossible, it does not commit Christians to denying God's immateriality. In traditional Christianity, God the Father, God the Holy Spirit, and God the Son (apart from the Incarnation) are clearly understood as lacking material structure and composition. Because of the shared conviction that God is immaterial, Christians along with Jews and Muslims have historically opposed material conceptions of God or gods such as one finds in Stoicism, according to which God is a vast material being, a world soul or animal, and in polytheism, according to which there are hosts of material deities. God's immaterial reality has also been used to articulate an important difference between monotheism and versions of pantheism... according to which the material world either is God or a part of God.&lt;ref name="Taliaferro2010"&gt;{{cite book |first=C. |last=Taliaferro |first2=P. |last2=Draper |first3=P.L. |last3=Quinn |year=2010 |title=A Companion to Philosophy of Religion |series=Blackwell Companions to Philosophy |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781405163576 |lccn=2009037505 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSCx-67Tk6cC&amp;pg=PA292 |page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Charles Taliaferro]]|"Incorporeality" in ''A Companion to Philosophy of Religion''}}

===LDS view===

Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church, Mormons) view the mainstream Christian belief in God's incorporeality as being founded upon a post-Apostolic departure from the traditional Judeo-Christian belief in an anthropomorphic, corporeal God. This concept of a corporeal God is supported by Biblical references to his face, mouth, finger, feet, back, and right hand; as well as various references to God creating man his own image and likeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.lds.org/scriptures/tg/god-body-of-corporeal-nature?lang=eng |title= Topical Guide: God, Body of, Corporeal Nature |website= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141208231344/http://www.lds.org/scriptures/tg/god-body-of-corporeal-nature?lang=eng |archive-date= 2014-12-08 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Robinson |first= Stephen E. |contribution= God the Father: Overview |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/3732 |pages= 548–550 |editor-last= Ludlow |editor-first= Daniel H |editor-link= Daniel H.

Mormons believe that when the Church's foundation of revelation ({{lds|Ephesians|eph|2|20}}, {{lds||eph|4|12|14}}) crumbled with the martyrdom of the Apostles, doctrine gradually began to shift as a result of the speculation and reasoning of theologians who took it upon themselves to continue the development of Christian doctrine despite not being authorized receivers of revelation for the body of the church. The writings of many of these post-Apostolic theologians show that they were influenced in varying degrees by the prevailing Greek metaphysical philosophies of that era, which strongly rejected the idea of a corporeal, material God.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.fairmormon.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Bickmore.GodHaveBody.pdf |title= Does God Have a Body in Human Form? |last= Bickmore |first= Barry R. |authorlink= Barry R.

Outler |translator-link= Albert C. Outler |origyear= c. 400 |year= 1955 |lccn= 55005021 |place= Philadelphia |publisher= Westminster Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustine of Hippo]] attributed his conception of God as incorporeal substance to Neoplatonism: "I no longer thought of thee, O God, by the analogy of a human body. Ever since I inclined my ear to philosophy I had avoided this error". Origen's preoccupation with the philosophers' concept of God is apparent in this quote from “Homilies on Genesis and Exodus”: "The Jews indeed, but also some of our own people, supposed that God should be understood as a man; that is, adorned with human members and human appearance. But the philosophers despise these stories as fabulous and formed in the likeness of poetic fictions".&lt;ref&gt;Ronald E. Heine, translator; "Origen: Homilies on Genesis and Exodus", The Catholic University of America Press, Washington D.C., 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

This Hellenistic rejection of anything material in the "metaphysical" world caused the resurrection to be one of the most hotly debated doctrines. This was apparent in the Greek's skeptical reaction to the doctrine of the resurrection in {{lds|Acts|acts|17}}, and is what prompted Paul's defense of the resurrection in {{lds|1 Corinthians|1-cor|15}}. In “Expositions on the Psalms” Augustine wrote, “Nothing has been attacked with the same pertinacious, contentious contradiction, in the Christian faith, as the resurrection of the flesh...many Gentile philosophers have...written that the soul is immortal: when they come to the resurrection of the flesh...they most openly deny it, declaring it to be absolutely impossible that this earthly flesh can ascend to Heaven.”&lt;ref&gt;"Exposition on Psalm 89", Translated by J.E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5659">In [[mathematics]], in the fields of [[multilinear algebra]] and [[representation theory]], '''invariants of tensors''' are coefficients of the [[characteristic polynomial]] of the [[tensor]] ''A'':&lt;ref&gt;SPENCER, A. J. M. Continuum Mechanics. Longman, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ p(\lambda):=\det (\mathbf{A}-\lambda \mathbf{E})&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the identity tensor and &lt;math&gt;\lambda\in\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; is the polynomial's [[Indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]] (it is important to bear in mind that a polynomial's indeterminate &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; may also be a non-scalar as long as power, scaling and adding make sense for it, e.g., &lt;math&gt;p(\mathbf{A})&lt;/math&gt; is legitimate, and in fact, quite useful).

The first invariant of an ''n''&amp;times;''n'' tensor A (&lt;math&gt;I_A&lt;/math&gt;) is the coefficient for &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; (because the coefficient for &lt;math&gt; \lambda^n &lt;/math&gt; is always 1), the second invariant (&lt;math&gt;II_A&lt;/math&gt;) is the coefficient for &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;, etc., the ''n''th invariant is the free term.

==Properties==
The first invariant (trace) is always the sum of the diagonal components:
:&lt;math&gt;\ I_A=A_{11}+A_{22}+ \cdots + A_{nn}=\mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{A}) \, &lt;/math&gt;
The ''n''th invariant is just &lt;math&gt;\pm \det \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, the determinant of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; (up to sign).

The invariants do not change with rotation of the coordinate system (they are objective). Obviously, any function of the invariants only is also objective.

==Calculation of the invariants of symmetric 3&amp;times;3 tensors==
Most [[Application of tensor theory in engineering science|tensors used in engineering]] are symmetric 3&amp;times;3.
For this case  the invariants can be calculated as:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathrm{I}_A= \mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{A}) = A_{11}+A_{22}+A_{33} = A_1+A_2+A_3 \,
 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{II}_A  = \frac{1}{2} \left( ( \mathrm{tr}\mathbf{A})^2 - \mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{A}^2 ) \right) = A_{11}A_{22}+A_{22}A_{33}+A_{11}A_{33}-A_{12}A_{21}-A_{23}A_{32}-A_{13}A_{31}

(the sum of [[principal minor]]s).  This expression holds for non-symmetric tensors. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=PA|url=http://homepages.engineering.auckland.ac.nz/~pkel015/SolidMechanicsBooks/Part_III/Chapter_1_Vectors_Tensors/Vectors_Tensors_11_Eigenvalue.pdf|website=Lecture Notes: An introduction to Solid Mechanics|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A_3&lt;/math&gt; are the [[eigenvalues]] of tensor&amp;nbsp;''A''.

Because of the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]] the following equation is always true:
:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf{A}^3 - \mathrm{I}_A \mathbf{A}^2 +\mathrm{II}_A \mathbf{A} -\mathrm{III}_A \mathbf{E}= 0&lt;/math&gt;
where ''E'' is the second-order identity tensor.

A similar equation holds for tensors of higher order.

==Engineering application==
A scalar valued tensor function ''f'' that depends merely on the three invariants of a symmetric 3&amp;times;3 tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is objective, i.e., independent from rotations of the coordinate system. Moreover, every objective tensor function depends only on the tensor's invariants. Thus, objectivity of a tensor function is fulfilled if, and only if, for some function &lt;math&gt;\ g:R^3\to R &lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt;\ f(\mathbf A)=g(I_A,II_A,III_A). \, &lt;/math&gt;

A common application to this is the evaluation of the potential energy as function of the strain tensor, within the framework of linear elasticity. Exhausting the above theorem the free energy of the system reduces to a function of 3 scalar parameters rather than 6. Within linear elasticity the free energy has to be quadratic in the tensor's elements, which eliminates an additional scalar. Thus, for an isotropic material only two independent parameters are needed to describe the elastic properties, known as Lamé coefficients. Consequently, experimental fits and computational efforts may be eased significantly.

This technique was first introduced into isotropic [[turbulence]] by [[Howard P. Robertson]] in 1940&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, H. P. (1940, April). The invariant theory of isotropic turbulence. In Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society (Vol. 36, No. 2, pp. 209-223). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was able to derive [[Kármán–Howarth equation]] from the invariant principle. [[George Batchelor]] and [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] exploited this technique by extending to axisymmetric turbulence&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor, G. K. (1946). The theory of axisymmetric turbulence. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A, 186(1007), 480-502.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, S. (1950). The theory of axisymmetric turbulence. Royal Society of London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, S. (1950). The decay of axisymmetric turbulence. Proc. Roy. Soc. A, 203, 358-364.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Other invariants==

Since the invariants are constant in any reference, functions of invariants are also constant. Some sources define the three invariants of the 3&amp;times;3 tensors as

:&lt;math&gt;I_1 = tr(\mathbf{A}) = A_{ii}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I_2 = tr(\mathbf{A}^2) = A_{ij}A_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;  This expression only holds for symmetric tensors.
:&lt;math&gt;I_3 = tr(\mathbf{A}^3) = A_{ij}A_{jk}A_{ki}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;I_A = I_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;II_A = \frac{1}{2}(I_1^2 - I_2)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;III_A = \frac{1}{6}(I_1^3 - 3 I_1 I_2 + 2 I_3)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Leandro Erlich''' (born 1973 in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]) is an internationally exhibited Argentine conceptual artist. In 2001 he represented his nation at the [[Venice Biennial]] and was included in the main section of the biennial once again in 2005.&lt;ref name="skny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skny.com/artists/leandro-erlich/|title=Sean Kelly Gallery - Leandro Erlich - Artist Biography|publisher=skny.com|accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist's work was also included in the 2000 [[Whitney Biennial]] and the 2001 [[Istanbul Biennial]].&lt;ref name="artnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/leandro-erlich/|title=Leandro Erlich on artnet|publisher=artnet.com|accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008 Erlich created a swimming pool installation which was on display at [[MoMA PS1]] in the [[Long Island City]] section of [[Queens]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="momaps1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://momaps1.org/exhibitions/view/207|title=MoMA PS1: Exhibitions: Leandro Erlich: Swimming Pool|publisher=momaps1.org|accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16907">In [[statistics]], the '''likelihood principle''' is that, given a [[statistical model]], all the evidence in a [[Sampling (statistics)|sample]] relevant to model parameters is contained in the [[likelihood function]].

A likelihood function arises from a [[probability density function]] considered as a function of its distributional parameterization argument. For example, consider a model which gives the probability density function ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''θ'') of observable [[random variable]] ''X'' as a function of a parameter&amp;nbsp;''θ''. Then for a specific value ''x'' of ''X'', the function &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L&lt;/math&gt;(''θ''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''x'') =&amp;nbsp;''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''θ'') is a likelihood function of&amp;nbsp;''θ'': it gives a measure of how "likely" any particular value of ''θ'' is, if we know that ''X'' has the value&amp;nbsp;''x''. The density function may be a density with respect to counting measure, i.e. a [[probability mass function]].

Two likelihood functions are ''equivalent'' if one is a scalar multiple of the other. The '''likelihood principle''' is this: all information from the data that is relevant to inferences about the value of the model parameters is in the equivalence class to which the likelihood function belongs. The '''strong likelihood principle''' applies this same criterion to cases such as sequential experiments where the sample of data that is available results from applying a [[stopping rule]] to the observations earlier in the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003) The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms. OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-920613-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==

Suppose

*''X'' is the number of successes in twelve [[statistical independence|independent]] [[Bernoulli trial]]s with probability ''θ'' of success on each trial, and
*''Y'' is the number of independent Bernoulli trials needed to get three successes, again with probability ''θ'' (= 1/2 for a coin-toss) of success on each trial.

Then the observation that ''X'' = 3 induces the likelihood function

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal L(\theta  \mid X=3) = \binom{12} 3 \theta^3(1-\theta)^9 = 220\theta^3(1-\theta)^9, &lt;/math&gt;

while the observation that ''Y'' = 12 induces the likelihood function

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal L(\theta \mid Y=12) = \binom{11} 2 \theta^3(1-\theta)^9 = 55\theta^3(1-\theta)^9.&lt;/math&gt;

The likelihood principle says that, as the data are the same in both cases, the inferences drawn about the value of θ should also be the same. In addition, all the inferential content in the data about the value of θ is contained in the two likelihoods, and is the same if they are proportional to one another. This is the case in the above example, reflecting the fact that the difference between observing ''X'' = 3 and observing ''Y'' = 12 lies not in the actual data, but merely in the [[design of experiments|design of the experiment]]. Specifically, in one case, one has decided in advance to try twelve times; in the other, to keep trying until three successes are observed.  The inference about θ should be the same, and this is reflected in the fact that the two likelihoods are proportional to each other.

This is not always the case, however. The use of [[frequentist]] methods involving [[p-values]] leads to different inferences for the two cases above,&lt;ref name="Vidakovic"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vidakovic|first1=Brani|title=The Likelihood Principle|url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~brani/isyebayes/bank/handout2.pdf|website=H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering|publisher=Georgia Tech|accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing that the outcome of frequentist methods depends on the experimental procedure, and thus violates the likelihood principle.

==The law of likelihood==

A related concept is the '''law of likelihood''', the notion that the extent to which the evidence supports one parameter value or hypothesis against another is equal to the ratio of their likelihoods.
That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda = {\mathcal L(a\mid X=x) \over \mathcal L(b\mid X=x)} = {P(X=x\mid a) \over P(X=x\mid b)}&lt;/math&gt;
is the degree to which the observation x supports parameter value or hypothesis ''a'' against ''b''. If this ratio is 1, the evidence is indifferent; if greater than 1, the evidence supports the value ''a'' against ''b''; or if less, then vice versa.  The use of [[Bayes factor]]s can extend this by taking account of the complexity of different hypotheses.

Combining the likelihood principle with the law of likelihood yields the consequence that the parameter value which maximizes the likelihood function is the value which is most strongly supported by the evidence. This is the basis for the widely used [[maximum likelihood|method of maximum likelihood]].

== History ==

The likelihood principle was first identified by that name in print in 1962
(Barnard et al., Birnbaum, and Savage et al.),
but arguments for the same principle, unnamed, and the use of the principle in applications goes back to the works of [[Ronald A. Fisher|R.A. Fisher]] in the 1920s. 
The law of likelihood was identified by that name by [[Ian Hacking|I. Hacking]] (1965).
More recently the likelihood principle as a general principle of inference has been championed by [[A. W. F. Edwards]]. The likelihood principle has been applied to the [[philosophy of science]] by R. Royall.&lt;ref&gt;Royall, Richard (1997) Statistical Evidence: A likelihood paradigm. Chapman and Hall, Boca Raton. {{ISBN|0-412-04411-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allan Birnbaum|Birnbaum]] proved that the likelihood principle follows from two more primitive and seemingly reasonable principles, the ''[[conditionality principle]]'' and the ''[[sufficiency principle]]''. The conditionality principle says that if an experiment is chosen by a random process independent of the states of nature &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, then only the experiment actually performed is relevant to inferences about &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. The sufficiency principle says that if &lt;math&gt;T(X)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[sufficient statistic]] for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, and if in two experiments with data &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; we have  &lt;math&gt;T(x_1)=T(x_2)&lt;/math&gt;, then the evidence about &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; given by the two experiments is the same.

== Arguments for and against ==
Some widely used methods of conventional statistics, for example many [[statistical hypothesis testing|significance test]]s, are not consistent with the likelihood principle.

Let us briefly consider some of the arguments for and against the likelihood principle.

===The original Birnbaum argument===

Birnbaum's proof of the likelihood principle has been disputed by philosophers of science, including [[Deborah Mayo]]&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, D. (2010) [http://www.phil.vt.edu/dmayo/personal_website/ch%207%20mayo%20birnbaum%20proof.pdf "An Error in the Argument from Conditionality and Sufficiency to the Likelihood Principle"] in ''Error and Inference: Recent Exchanges on Experimental Reasoning, Reliability and the Objectivity and Rationality of Science'' (D Mayo and A. Spanos eds.), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press: 305-314.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, Deborah (2014), "[https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1408368565 On the Birnbaum Argument for the Strong Likelihood Principle]", ''[[Statistical Science]]'', 29: 227-266 (with Discussion).&lt;/ref&gt; and statisticians including Michael Evans.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Michael (2013) [https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5468 What does the proof of Birnbaum's theorem prove?]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, a new proof of the likelihood principle has been provided by Greg Gandenberger.&lt;ref&gt;Gandenberger, Greg (2014), "A new proof of the likelihood principle", ''[[British Journal for the Philosophy of Science]]'', 66: 475-503; {{doi|10.1093/bjps/axt039}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental design arguments on the likelihood principle===
Unrealized events play a role in some common statistical methods. For example, the result of a [[statistical hypothesis testing|significance test]] depends on the [[p-value|''p''-value]], the probability of a result as extreme or more extreme than the observation, and that probability may depend on the design of the experiment. To the extent that the likelihood principle is accepted, such methods are therefore denied.

Some classical significance tests are not based on the likelihood.  A commonly cited example is the [[optional stopping]] problem. Suppose I tell you that I tossed a coin 12 times and in the process observed 3 heads. You might make some inference about the probability of heads and whether the coin was fair. Suppose now I tell that I tossed the coin ''until'' I observed 3 heads, and I tossed it 12 times. Will you now make some different inference?

The likelihood function is the same in both cases: it is proportional to
:&lt;math&gt;p^3 (1-p)^9.&lt;/math&gt;

According to the likelihood principle, the inference should be the same in either case.

Suppose a number of scientists are assessing the probability of a certain outcome (which we shall call 'success') in experimental trials. Conventional wisdom suggests that if there is no bias towards success or failure then the success probability would be one half.  Adam, a scientist, conducted 12 trials and obtains 3 successes and 9 failures.  Then he left the lab.

Bill, a colleague in the same lab, continued Adam's  work and published Adam's results, along with a significance test. He tested the [[null hypothesis]] that ''p'', the success probability, is equal to a half, versus ''p'' &lt; 0.5. The probability of the observed result that out of 12 trials 3 or something fewer (i.e. more extreme) were successes, if ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is true, is

:&lt;math&gt;\left({12 \choose 9}+{12 \choose 10}+{12 \choose 11}+{12 \choose 12}\right)\left({1 \over 2}\right)^{12}&lt;/math&gt;

which is 299/4096 = 7.3%. Thus the null hypothesis is not rejected at the 5% significance level.

Charlotte, another scientist, reads Bill's paper and writes a letter, saying that it is possible that Adam kept trying until he obtained 3 successes, in which case the probability of needing to conduct 12 or more experiments is given by

: &lt;math&gt;1-\left({10 \choose 2}\left({1 \over 2}\right)^{11}+{9 \choose 2}\left({1 \over 2} \right)^{10}+\cdots +{2 \choose 2}\left({1 \over 2}\right)^3 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

which is 134/4096 = 3.27%. Now the result ''is'' statistically significant at the 5% level. Note that there is no contradiction among these two results; both computations are correct.

To these scientists, whether a result is significant or not depends on the design of the experiment, not on the likelihood (in the sense of the likelihood function) of the parameter value being&amp;nbsp;1/2.

Results of this kind are considered by some as arguments against the likelihood principle. For others it exemplifies the value of the likelihood principle and is an argument against significance tests.

Similar themes appear when comparing [[Fisher's exact test]] with [[Pearson's chi-squared test]].

===The voltmeter story===

An argument in favor of the likelihood principle is given by Edwards in his book ''Likelihood''. He cites the following story from J.W. Pratt, slightly condensed here. Note that the likelihood function depends only on what actually happened, and not on what ''could'' have happened.

: An engineer draws a random sample of electron tubes and measures their voltage. The measurements range from 75 to 99 volts. A statistician computes the sample mean and a confidence interval for the true mean. Later the statistician discovers that the voltmeter reads only as far as 100, so the population appears to be 'censored'. This necessitates a new analysis, if the statistician is orthodox. However, the engineer says he has another meter reading to 1000 volts, which he would have used if any voltage had been over 100. This is a relief to the statistician, because it means the population was effectively uncensored after all. But, the next day the engineer informs the statistician that this second meter was not working at the time of the measuring. The statistician ascertains that the engineer would not have held up the measurements until the meter was fixed, and informs him that new measurements are required. The engineer is astounded. "Next you'll be asking about my oscilloscope".

This story can be translated to Adam's stopping rule above, as follows. Adam stopped immediately after 3 successes, because his boss Bill had instructed him to do so. Adam did not die. After the publication of the statistical analysis by Bill, Adam discovers that he has missed a second instruction from Bill to conduct 12 trials instead, and that Bill's paper is based on this second instruction. Adam is very glad that he got his 3 successes after exactly 12 trials, and explains to his friend Charlotte that by coincidence he executed the second instruction. Later, he is astonished to hear about Charlotte's letter explaining that now the result is significant.

'''Live coding'''&lt;ref&gt;Collins, N., McLean, A., Rohrhuber, J. &amp; Ward, A. (2003), "[http://akustik.hfbk.net/publications/LiveCodingInLaptopPerformance.pdf Live Coding in Laptop Performance]", ''Organised Sound'' 8(3): 321–30. {{doi|10.1017/S135577180300030X}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes referred to as 'on-the-fly programming',&lt;ref&gt;Wang G. &amp; Cook P. (2004) [http://soundlab.cs.princeton.edu/publications/on-the-fly_nime2004.pdf "On-the-fly Programming: Using Code as an Expressive Musical Instrument"], In ''Proceedings of the 2004 International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)'' (New York: NIME, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; 'just in time programming' and 'conversational programming') makes programming an integral part of the running program.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Blackwell, Alex McLean, James Noble, Jochen Otto, and Julian Rohrhuber, "Collaboration and learning through live coding (Dagstuhl Seminar 13382)", Dagstuhl Reports 3 (2014), no. 9, 130–168.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is most prominent as a [[performing arts]] form and a [[creativity technique]] centred upon the writing of [[source code]] and the use of [[interactive programming]] in an [[improvisation|improvised]] way. Live coding is often used to create sound and image based [[digital media]], as well as light systems, improvised [[dance]] and poetry,&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson, T. (2013). [https://liveprogramming.github.io/2013/papers/thor.pdf The Threnoscope. A Musical Work for Live Coding Performance]. In Live 2013. First International Workshop on Live Programming.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8221235.stm|title= Tech Know: Programming, meet music |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2010-03-25 | date=2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; though is particularly prevalent in [[computer music]] usually as improvisation, although it could be combined with [[algorithmic composition]].&lt;ref&gt;Collins, N. (2003) "[https://wiki.brown.edu/confluence/download/attachments/74258672/Collins,+Generative+Music.pdf Generative Music and Laptop Performance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514102233/https://wiki.brown.edu/confluence/download/attachments/74258672/Collins,+Generative+Music.pdf |date=2014-05-14 }}", ''Contemporary Music Review'' 22(4):67–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the process of writing source code is made visible by projecting the computer screen in the audience space, with ways of visualising the code an area of active research.&lt;ref&gt;McLean, A., Griffiths, D., Collins, N., and Wiggins, G. (2010). [http://yaxu.org/visualisation-of-live-code/ Visualisation of live code]. In Electronic Visualisation and the Arts London 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Live coding techniques are also employed outside of performance, such as in producing sound for film&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rohrhuber|first=Julian|title=Artificial, Natural, Historical in Transdisciplinary Digital Art. Sound, Vision and the New Screen|year=2008|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|pages=60–70|url=http://akustik.hfbk.net/publications/rohrhuber_artificial_natural_historical.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; or audiovisual work for interactive art installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Communion by Universal Everything and Field.io: interview|url=http://www.creativeapplications.net/scripts/communion-cinder-scripts-events-special/|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the interconnection between computers makes possible to realize this practice networked in group. 

The figure of '''live coder''' is who performs the act of live coding, usually "artists who want to learn to code, and coders who want to express themselves"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Sarah|title=Live coding brings programming to life - an interview with Alex McLean|url=http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/blog/live-coding-brings-programming-to-life-an-interview-with-alex-mac|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in terms of Wang &amp; Cook the "programmer/performer/composer".&lt;ref&gt;Wang G. &amp; Cook P. (2004) [http://soundlab.cs.princeton.edu/publications/on-the-fly_nime2004.pdf "On-the-fly Programming: Using Code as an Expressive Musical Instrument"], In ''Proceedings of the 2004 International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)'' (New York: NIME, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Live coding is also an increasingly popular technique in programming-related lectures and conference presentations, and has been described as a "best practice" for computer science lectures by [[Mark Guzdial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Guzdial|first=Mark|title=What students get wrong when building computational physics models in Python: Cabellero thesis part 2|url=http://computinged.wordpress.com/2011/08/01/what-students-get-wrong-when-building-computational-physics-models-in-python-cabellero-thesis-part-2/|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Live coding techniques ==

A range of techniques have been developed and appropriated for the purposes of live coding.

=== Representation and manipulation of time ===

The specific affordances of time-based media and live interaction with code has led to a number of novel developments and uses in programming language design. Through mutual embedding of imperative and declarative subsystems, the programming language [[SuperCollider]]&lt;ref&gt;James McCartney (1996), SuperCollider: a new real time synthesis language, ICMC Proceedings, 1996.
&lt;/ref&gt; permitted to build a library that allows incomplete and provisional specifications which can be rewritten at runtime.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Rohrhuber, Alberto de Campo, and Renate Wieser (2005), Algorithms today - Notes on Language Design for Just In Time Programming, Proceedings of International Computer Music Conference (Barcelona), ICMC, 2005, pp. 455–458.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ChucK]] language introduced an approach to "strongly timed" programming in 2002, embedding precision timing into control flow through a concise syntax.

"Temporal recursion" was a term initially coined in relation to the [[Impromptu (programming environment)|Impromptu]] programming environment. Technical elements within a programming environment continue to locate compressors and recursion solutions, but timing had been a major issue. While the general form of a temporal recursion, being any asynchronous function recursion through time, is available to any event driven system, Impromptu has placed a special emphasis on this particular design pattern,&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, A &amp; Gardner, H (2010) "[http://eprints.qut.edu.au/55712/1/sorensen_ow_2010.pdf Programming With Time: Cyberphysical Programming In Impromptu, In proceedings of the ACM Splash Conference 2010]"&lt;/ref&gt; making it the centre piece of the concurrency architecture on that platform. Temporal recursion had repeatedly been used in [[SuperCollider]] and has since been implemented in the [[Fluxus (programming environment)|Fluxus]] environment.

Another functional approach to the representation of time is shown in the [[Tidal (livecoding)|Tidal]] pattern [[Domain-specific language|DSL]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLean|first=Alex|chapter=[https://github.com/yaxu/Tidal/blob/master/doc/farm/farm.pdf?raw=true Making programming languages to dance to: Live Coding with Tidal]|title=In proceedings of the 2nd ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modelling and Design|year=2014|location=Gothenburg|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which represents patterns as combinators operating over functions of time, similar to techniques in [[functional reactive programming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLean|first=Alex|title=Tidal homepage|url=https://yaxu.org/tidal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multi-user programming and shared memory ===

Multi-user programming has developed in the context of group music-making, through the long development of the ''Republic'' system developed and employed by members of the network band ''PowerBooks Unplugged''.&lt;ref&gt;Rohrhuber, J., A. de Campo, R. Wieser, J.-K. van Kampen, E. Ho, and H. Hölzl (2007). [http://www.wertlos.org/articles/Purloined_letters.pdf Purloined letters and distributed persons]. In Music in the Global Village Conference 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Republic is built into the SuperCollider language, and allows participants to collaboratively write live code that is distributed across the network of computers. There are similar efforts in other languages, such as the distributed tuple space used in the Impromptu language.&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, A. (2010). [http://impromptu.moso.com.au/extras/icmc2010.pdf A distributed memory for networked livecoding performance]. In Proceedings of International Computer Music Conference 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally Overtone, Impromptu and Extempore support multi-user sessions, in which any number of programmers can intervene across the network in a given runtime process.&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, A. (2005). [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/31056/ Impromptu : an interactive programming environment for composition and performance, In proceedings of the Australasian Computer Music Conference 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently systems as Extramuros are used to live coding in group through the technique of shared buffers of code written in SuperCollider and TidalCycles languages. The practice of writing code in group can be done in the same room through a local network or from remote places accessing a common server. Terms like laptop band, laptop orchestra, collaborative live coding or collective live coding are used to frame a networked live coding practice both in a local or remote way.

== Organizations ==
TOPLAP (The (Temporary|Transnational|Terrestrial|Transdimensional) Organisation for the (Promotion|Proliferation|Permanence|Purity) of Live (Algorithm|Audio|Art|Artistic) Programming) is an informal organization formed in February 2004 to bring together the various communities that had formed around live coding environments.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, A., Rohrhuber, J., Olofsson, F., McLean, A., Griffiths, D., Collins, N., and Alexander, A. (2004). [http://art.runme.org/1107861145-2780-0/livecoding.pdf Live algorithm programming and a temporary organisation for its promotion]. In Goriunova, O. and Shulgin, A., editors, read_me - Software Art and Cultures.&lt;/ref&gt; The TOPLAP manifesto asserts several requirements for a TOPLAP compliant performance, in particular that performers' screens should be projected and not hidden.&lt;ref&gt;http://toplap.org/wiki/ManifestoDraft&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

A number of research projects and research groups have been created to explore live coding, often taking interdisciplinary approaches bridging the humanities and sciences. First efforts to both develop live coding systems and embed the emerging field in the broader theoretical context happened in the research project Artistic Interactivity in Hybrid Networks from 2005 to 2008, funded by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215643/http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/muwi/c10/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, the Live Coding Research Network was funded by the UK [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] for two years from February 2014, supporting a range of activities including symposia, workshops and an annual international conference called ICLC.

In Madrid, since 2015 a group of experimentation on free software called Live Code Mad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Live Code Mad. Grupo de experimentación con Software Libre para la programación de sonido digital.|url=http://medialab-prado.es/article/live-coding-en-medialab|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; organizes regular meetings in order to experiment with different live coding platforms and languages. In Mexico, a workshop of live coding take place in Instituto Politécnico Nacional at ESFM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Live Coding at IPN Mexico.|url=http://www.esfm.ipn.mx/Estudiantes/Paginas/Act_Deportivas_Culturales.aspx|accessdate=30 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629055355/http://www.esfm.ipn.mx/Estudiantes/Paginas/Act_Deportivas_Culturales.aspx|archivedate=29 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In USA there is a group called Live Code NYC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Live Code NYC|url=http://livecode.nyc/|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2014 the collective Algo0ritmos is working in Medellin, this group develop tools for live coding focused on live coding and free software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=algo0ritmos|url=https://twitter.com/algo0ritmos|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abatement cost is the cost of reducing environmental negatives such as pollution. Marginal cost is an economic concept that measures the cost of an additional unit. The '''marginal abatement cost''' ('''MAC'''), in general, measures the cost of reducing one more unit of pollution.

Although marginal abatement costs can be negative, such as when the low carbon option is cheaper than the business-as-usual option, MACs often rise steeply as more pollution is reduced.

Marginal abatement costs are typically used on a '''marginal abatement cost curve''' (MACC) or '''MAC curve''', which shows the marginal cost of additional reductions in pollution.

== Usage ==
Carbon traders use MAC curves to derive the supply function for modelling carbon price fundamentals. Power companies may employ MAC curves to guide their decisions about long-term capital investment strategies to select among a variety of efficiency and generation options. Economists have used MAC curves to explain the economics of interregional carbon trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/globalchange/www/MITJPSPGC_Rpt40.pdf |title=Ellerman, A.D. and Decaux, A., Analysis of post-Kyoto {{CO2}}&amp;#125; emissions trading using marginal abatement curves, 1998. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy-makers use MAC curves as [[merit order]] curves, to analyze how much abatement can be done in an economy at what cost, and where policy should be directed to achieve the emission reductions.

However, MAC curves should not be used as abatement supply curves (or [[merit order]] curves) to decide which measures to implement in order to achieve a given emission-reduction target. Indeed, the options they list would take decades to implement, and it may be optimal to implement expensive but high-potential measures before introducing cheaper measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vogt-Schilb, A. and Hallegatte, S., 2014. Marginal abatement cost curves and the optimal timing of mitigation measures. |journal=Energy Policy |volume=66|pages= 645–653 |date= |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2013.11.045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The way that MAC curves are usually built has been criticized for lack of transparency and the poor treatment it makes of uncertainty, inter-temporal dynamics, interactions between sectors and ancillary benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Marginal abatement cost curves: a call for caution|date=|doi=10.1080/14693062.2011.582347 | volume=12|journal=Climate Policy|pages=219–236}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also concern regarding the biased ranking that occurs if some included options have negative costs. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levihn|first=Fabian|date=2016-11-01|title=On the problem of optimizing through least cost per unit, when costs are negative: Implications for cost curves and the definition of economic efficiency|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544216312026|journal=Energy|volume=114|pages=1155–1163|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2016.08.089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Simon|date=2012-09-01|title=The ranking of negative-cost emissions reduction measures|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421512004843|journal=Energy Policy|series=Special Section: Frontiers of Sustainability|volume=48|pages=430–438|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2012.05.071}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=D.

==Examples of existing MAC curves==
Various economists, research organizations, and consultancies have produced MAC curves. Bloomberg New Energy Finance&lt;ref&gt;[http://carbon.newenergyfinance.com/download.php?n=BBNEF_CarbonMarkets_NAmerica_RN_2010_01_RN_USMACC.pdf&amp;f=fileName&amp;t=NCF_downloads Bloomberg New Energy Finance, US Marginal Abatement Cost Curve, 2010]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[McKinsey &amp; Company]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/ccsi/greenhousegas.asp McKinsey &amp; Company, Reducing US greenhouse gas emissions: how much at what cost? 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; have produced economy wide analyses on greenhouse gas emissions reductions for the [[United States]]. [[ICF International]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-500-2005-121/CEC-500-2005-121.PDF |title=ICF International, Emission reduction opportunities for non-{{CO2}}&amp;#125; greenhouse gases in California, 2005 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced a California specific curve following [[AB-32]] legislation as have Sweeney and Weyant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.stanford.edu/group/peec/cgi-bin/docs/policy/research/September%2027%202008%20Discussion%20Draft%20-%20Analysis%20of%20Measures%20to%20Meet%20the%20Requirements%20of%20Californias%20Assembly%20Bill%2032.pdf Sweeney, J. and Weyant, J., Analysis of measures to meet the requirements of California’s Assembly Bill 32, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy]] produced several marginal abatement cost curves for Germany (also called Cost Potential Curves), depending on the perspective (end-user, utilities, society).&lt;ref&gt;[http://epub.wupperinst.org/files/5015/5015_EE_EDL_en.pdf Options and Potentials for Energy End-use Efficiency and Energy Services, Wuppertal Institute, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[Environmental Protection Agency]] has done work on a MAC curve for non carbon dioxide emissions such as methane, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and HFCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/economics/international.html |title=EPA, Global mitigation of non-{{CO2}}&amp;#125; greenhouse gases, 2006 |publisher=Epa.gov |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enerdata and LEPII-CNRS (France) produce MAC curves with the [[Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems]] (POLES) model for the 6 [[Kyoto Protocol]] gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enerdata.net/enerdatauk/energy-advisory/forecasting/mac-curves-methodology.php |title=Enerdata, Production of MAC curves by sector and by country, 2015 |publisher=Enerdata.net |date= |accessdate=2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; These curves have been used for various public and private actors either to assess carbon policies &lt;ref&gt;Impacts of Multi-gas Strategies for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Abatement: Insights from a Partial Equilibirum Model, Criqui P., Russ P., Deybe D., in The Energy Journal, Special Issue: Multi-Greenhouse Gas Mitigation and Climate Policy, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; or through the use of a carbon market analysis tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enerdata.net/enerdatauk/solutions/energy-models/aspen-model.php |title=Enerdata, Use of MACCs for carbon markets analysis, 2015 |publisher=Enerdata.net |date= |accessdate=2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[electromagnetism]], a branch of fundamental [[physics]], the '''matrix representations of the [[Maxwell equations|Maxwell's equations]]''' are a [[Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field|formulation of Maxwell's equations]] using [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], [[complex numbers]], and [[vector calculus]].  These representations are for a [[homogeneous medium]], an approximation in an [[inhomogeneous medium]]. A matrix representation for an inhomogeneous medium was presented using a pair of matrix equations.&lt;ref&gt;(Bialynicki-Birula, 1994, 1996a, 1996b)&lt;/ref&gt; A single equation using 4 × 4 matrices is necessary and sufficient for any homogeneous medium. For an inhomogeneous medium it necessarily requires 8 × 8 matrices.&lt;ref&gt;(Khan, 2002, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

Maxwell's equations in the standard vector calculus formalism, in an inhomogeneous medium with sources, are:&lt;ref&gt;(Jackson, 1998; Panofsky and Phillips, 1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; {\mathbf \nabla} \cdot {\mathbf D} \left({\mathbf r} , t \right) =
\rho\, \\
&amp; {\mathbf \nabla} \times {\mathbf H} \left({\mathbf r} , t \right)
- \frac{\partial }{\partial t}
{\mathbf D} \left({\mathbf r} , t \right) =
{\mathbf J}\, \\
&amp; {\mathbf \nabla} \times {\mathbf E} \left({\mathbf r} , t \right)
+
\frac{\partial }{\partial t}
{\mathbf B} \left({\mathbf r} , t \right) = 0\, \\
&amp; {\mathbf \nabla} \cdot {\mathbf B} \left({\mathbf r} , t \right) = 0\,.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The media is assumed to be [[linear media|linear]], that is

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf D} = \epsilon {\mathbf E}\,,\quad {\mathbf B} = \mu {\mathbf H}&lt;/math&gt;,

where ε = ε('''r''', ''t'') is the [[Permittivity|permittivity of the medium]] and μ = μ('''r''', ''t'') the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability of the medium]] (see [[constitutive equation]]).  For a homogeneous medium ε and μ are constants.
The [[speed of light]] in the medium is given by
:&lt;math&gt;v ({\mathbf r} , t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon ({\mathbf r} , t) \mu ({\mathbf r} , t)}}&lt;/math&gt;.

In vacuum, ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.85 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·N&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; and μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 4π × 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; H·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;

One possible way to obtain the required matrix representation is
to use the [[Riemann-Silberstein vector]] &lt;ref&gt;(Silberstein, 1907a, 1907b, Bialynicki-Birula, 1996b)&lt;/ref&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
{\mathbf F}^{+} \left({\mathbf r} , t \right)
&amp; =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\left(
\sqrt{\epsilon ({\mathbf r} , t)} {\mathbf E} \left({\mathbf r} , t \right)
+ {\rm i} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu ({\mathbf r} , t)}} {\mathbf B} \left({\mathbf r} , t \right) \right) \\
{\mathbf F}^{-} \left({\mathbf r} , t \right)
&amp; =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\left(
\sqrt{\epsilon ({\mathbf r} , t)} {\mathbf E} \left({\mathbf r} , t \right)
- {\rm i} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu ({\mathbf r} , t)}} {\mathbf B} \left({\mathbf r} , t \right) \right)\,.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If for a certain medium ε = ε('''r''', ''t'') and μ = μ('''r''', ''t'') are constants (or can be treated as ''local'' constants under certain approximations), then the vectors '''F'''&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt; ('''r''', ''t'') satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
{\rm i} \frac{\partial }{\partial t} {\mathbf F}^{\pm} \left({\mathbf r} , t \right)
&amp; =
\pm v {\mathbf \nabla} \times {\mathbf F}^{\pm} \left({\mathbf r} , t \right)
- \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \epsilon}} ({\rm i} {\mathbf J}) \\
{\mathbf \nabla} \cdot {\mathbf F}^{\pm} \left({\mathbf r} , t \right) 
&amp; =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \epsilon}} (\rho)\,.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus by using the Riemann-Silberstein vector, it is possible to reexpress the Maxwell's equations for a
medium with constant ε = ε('''r''', ''t'') and μ = μ('''r''', ''t'') as a
pair of equations.

== Homogeneous medium ==
In order to obtain a single matrix equation instead of a pair, the following new functions
are constructed using the components of the Riemann-Silberstein vector&lt;ref&gt;(Khan, 2002, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Psi^{+} ({\mathbf r} , t)
&amp; =
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
- F_x^{+}  + {\rm i} F_y^{+} \\
F_z^{+} \\
F_z^{+} \\
F_x^{+} + {\rm i} F_y^{+}
\end{array}
\right]\, \quad 
\Psi^{-} ({\mathbf r} , t) =
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
- F_x^{-}  - {\rm i} F_y^{-} \\
F_z^{-} \\
F_z^{-} \\
F_x^{-} - {\rm i} F_y^{-}
\end{array}
\right]\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The vectors for the sources are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
W^{+} 
&amp;=
\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \epsilon}}\right)
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
- J_x + {\rm i} J_y \\
J_z - v \rho \\
J_z + v \rho \\
J_x + {\rm i} J_y
\end{array}
\right]\, \quad
W^{-}
=
\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \epsilon}}\right)
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
- J_x - {\rm i} J_y \\
J_z - v \rho \\
J_z + v \rho \\
J_x - {\rm i} J_y
\end{array}
\right]\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Then,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}
\Psi^{+}
&amp;=
- v
\left\{ {\mathbf M} \cdot {\mathbf \nabla} \right\} \Psi^{+}
- W^{+}\, \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}
\Psi^{-}
&amp; =
- v
\left\{ {\mathbf M}^{*} \cdot {\mathbf \nabla} \right\} \Psi^{-}
- W^{-}\, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where * denotes [[complex conjugation]] and the triplet, '''M''' = (''M&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''M&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'') is expressed in terms of

:&lt;math&gt;
\Omega =
\begin{pmatrix}
{\mathbf 0} &amp; - {\mathbf l} \\
{\mathbf l} &amp; {\mathbf 0}
\end{pmatrix}
\, \qquad 
\beta =
\begin{pmatrix}
{\mathbf l} &amp; {\mathbf 0} \\
{\mathbf 0} &amp; - {\mathbf l}
\end{pmatrix}
\, \qquad
{\mathbf l} =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}
\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternately, one may use the matrix ''J'' = −Ω.  Both differ by a sign.  For our purpose it is fine to use either Ω or ''J''. However, they have a different meaning: ''J'' is [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]]
and Ω is [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]]. The matrix Ω corresponds to the [[Lagrange bracket]]s of [[classical mechanics]] and ''J'' corresponds to the [[Poisson bracket]]s.  An important relation is Ω = ''J''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The ''M''-matrices are

:&lt;math&gt;
M_x =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix} =
- \beta \Omega\, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
M_y =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; - {\rm i} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; - {\rm i} \\
{\rm i} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; {\rm i} &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix} =
{\rm i} \Omega\, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M_z =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; - 1
\end{bmatrix} =
\beta \,.
&lt;/math&gt;

Each of the four Maxwell's equations are obtained from the
matrix representation.  This is done by taking
the sums and differences of row-I with row-IV and row-II with row-III
respectively.  The first three give the ''y'', ''x'' and ''z'' components
of the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] and the last one gives the [[divergence]] conditions.

It is to be noted that the [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] '''M''' are all [[Non-singular matrix|non-singular]] and all are [[Hermitian matrices|Hermitian]].  Moreover, they satisfy the usual algebra of the [[Dirac matrices]], including,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
M_x \beta = - \beta M_x\, \\
M_y \beta = - \beta M_y\, \\
M_x^2 = M_y^2 = M_z^2 = I\, \\
M_x M_y = - M_y M_x = {\rm i} M_z\, \\
M_y M_z = - M_z M_y = {\rm i} M_x\, \\
M_z M_x = - M_x M_z = {\rm i} M_y\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

It is to be noted that the (Ψ&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;, '''M''') are ''not'' unique. Different choices of Ψ&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt; would give rise to different '''M''', such that the triplet '''M''' continues to satisfy the algebra of the Dirac matrices. The Ψ&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt; ''via'' the Riemann-Silberstein vector has certain advantages over the other possible choices.&lt;ref&gt;(Bialynicki-Birula, 1996b)&lt;/ref&gt; The Riemann-Silberstein vector is well known in [[classical electrodynamics]] and has certain interesting properties and uses.&lt;ref&gt;(Bialynicki-Birula, 1996b)&lt;/ref&gt;

In deriving the above 4 × 4 matrix representation of the Maxwell's equations, the spatial and temporal derivatives of ε('''r''', ''t'') and μ('''r''', ''t'') in the first two of the Maxwell's equations  have been ignored.  The ε and μ have been treated as ''local'' constants.

== Inhomogeneous medium ==
In an inhomogeneous medium, the spatial and temporal variations of ε = ε('''r''', ''t'') and μ = μ('''r''', ''t'') are not zero. 
That is they are no longer ''local'' constant. Instead of using ε = ε('''r''', ''t'') and μ = μ('''r''', ''t''), it is advantageous to use the two derived ''laboratory functions'' namely the [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance function]] and the [[Velocity of light|velocity function]]

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\text{ Velocity function:} \, v ({\mathbf r} , t)
&amp; =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon ({\mathbf r} , t) \mu ({\mathbf r} , t)}} \\
\text{Resistance function:} \, h ({\mathbf r} , t)
&amp; = 
\sqrt{\frac{\mu ({\mathbf r} , t)}{\epsilon ({\mathbf r} , t)}}\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of these functions:
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = \frac{1}{v h}\,,\quad \mu = \frac{h}{v}&lt;/math&gt;. 
These functions occur in the matrix representation through their [[logarithmic derivative]]s;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
{\mathbf u} ({\mathbf r} , t)
&amp; =
\frac{1}{2 v ({\mathbf r} , t)} {\mathbf \nabla} v ({\mathbf r} , t) =
\frac{1}{2} {\mathbf \nabla} \left\{\ln v ({\mathbf r} , t) \right\} =
- \frac{1}{2} {\mathbf \nabla} \left\{\ln n ({\mathbf r} , t) \right\} \\
{\mathbf w} ({\mathbf r} , t) &amp;=
\frac{1}{2 h ({\mathbf r} , t)} {\mathbf \nabla} h ({\mathbf r} , t) =
\frac{1}{2} {\mathbf \nabla} \left\{\ln h ({\mathbf r} , t) \right\}\, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;n ({\mathbf r} , t) = \frac{c}{v ({\mathbf r} , t)}&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[refractive index]] of the medium.

The following matrices naturally arise in the exact matrix representation of the Maxwell's equation in a medium

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
{\mathbf \Sigma} =
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
{\mathbf \sigma} &amp; {\mathbf 0} \\
{\mathbf 0} &amp; {\mathbf \sigma}
\end{array}
\right]\, \qquad
{\mathbf \alpha} =
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
{\mathbf 0} &amp; {\mathbf \sigma} \\
{\mathbf \sigma} &amp; {\mathbf 0}
\end{array}
\right]\, \qquad
{\mathbf I} =
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
{\mathbf 1} &amp; {\mathbf 0} \\
{\mathbf 0} &amp; {\mathbf 1}
\end{array}
\right]\, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''Σ''' are the [[Gamma matrices|Dirac spin matrices]] and '''α''' are the matrices used in the [[Dirac equation]], and '''σ''' is the triplet of the [[Pauli matrices]]

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf \sigma} = (\sigma_x , \sigma_y , \sigma_z) =
\left[
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}
,
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; - {\rm i} \\
{\rm i} &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}
,
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; -1
\end{pmatrix}
\right]&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the matrix representation is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;
\frac{\partial }{\partial t}
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
{\mathbf I} &amp; {\mathbf 0} \\
{\mathbf 0} &amp; {\mathbf I}
\end{array}
\right]
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
\Psi^{+} \\
\Psi^{-}
\end{array}
\right]
-
\frac{\dot{v} ({\mathbf r} , t)}{2 v ({\mathbf r} , t)}
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
{\mathbf I} &amp; {\mathbf 0} \\
{\mathbf 0} &amp; {\mathbf I}
\end{array}
\right]
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
\Psi^{+} \\
\Psi^{-}
\end{array}
\right]
+ \frac{\dot{h} ({\mathbf r} , t)}{2 h ({\mathbf r} , t)}
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
{\mathbf 0} &amp; {\rm i} \beta \alpha_y \\
{\rm i} \beta \alpha_y &amp; {\mathbf 0} 
\end{array}
\right]
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
\Psi^{+} \\
\Psi^{-}
\end{array}
\right] \\
&amp; =  - v ({\mathbf r} , t)
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\left\{
{\mathbf M} \cdot {\mathbf \nabla}
+
{\mathbf \Sigma} \cdot {\mathbf u}
\right\}
&amp; &amp;
- {\rm i} \beta
\left({\mathbf \Sigma} \cdot {\mathbf w}\right)
\alpha_y
\\
- {\rm i} \beta
\left({\mathbf \Sigma}^{*} \cdot {\mathbf w}\right)
\alpha_y
&amp;
\left\{
{\mathbf M}^{*} \cdot {\mathbf \nabla}
+
{\mathbf \Sigma}^{*} \cdot {\mathbf u} 
\right\}
\end{array}
\right]
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
\Psi^{+} \\
\Psi^{-}
\end{array}
\right] 
- \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
{\mathbf I} &amp; {\mathbf 0} \\
{\mathbf 0} &amp; {\mathbf I}
\end{array}
\right]
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
W^{+} \\
W^{-}
\end{array}
\right]\,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The above representation contains thirteen 8 × 8 matrices. Ten of these are [[Hermitian matrices|Hermitian]].  The exceptional ones are the ones that contain the three components of '''w'''('''r''', ''t''), the logarithmic gradient of the resistance function.  These three matrices, for the resistance function are [[antihermitian]].

The Maxwell's equations have been expressed in a matrix form for a medium with varying permittivity ε = ε('''r''', ''t'') and permeability μ = μ('''r''', ''t''), in presence of sources. This representation uses a single matrix equation, instead of a ''pair'' of matrix equations. In this representation, using 8 × 8 matrices, it has been possible to separate the dependence of the coupling between the upper components (Ψ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and the lower components (Ψ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) through the two laboratory functions. Moreover, the exact matrix representation has an algebraic structure very similar to the Dirac equation.&lt;ref&gt;(Khan, 2002, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell's equations can be derived from the [[Fermat's principle]] of [[geometrical optics]] by the process of "wavization"{{clarify|date=March 2013}}&lt;!---"describe as a wave?"---&gt; analogous to the [[Canonical quantization|quantization]] of [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;(Pradhan, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

One of the early uses of the matrix forms of the Maxwell's equations was to study certain symmetries, and the similarities with the Dirac equation.

The matrix form of the Maxwell's equations is used as a candidate for the [[Riemann-Silberstein vector#Photon wave function|Photon Wavefunction]].&lt;ref&gt;(Bialynicki-Birula, 1996b)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the [[geometrical optics]] is based on the [[Fermats principle|Fermat’s principle of least time]]. Geometrical optics can be completely derived from the Maxwell's equations. This is traditionally done using the [[Helmholtz equation]]. It is to be noted that the derivation of the Helmholtz equation from the [[Maxwell equation|Maxwell’s equations]] is an approximation as one neglects the spatial and temporal derivatives of the permittivity and permeability of the medium. A new formalism of light beam optics has been developed, starting with the Maxwell’s equations in a matrix form: a single entity containing all the four Maxwell’s equations.
Such a prescription is sure to provide a deeper understanding of beam-optics and [[Photon polarization|polarization]] in a unified manner.&lt;ref&gt;(Khan, 2006b, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
The beam-optical Hamiltonian derived from this matrix representation has an algebraic structure very similar to the [[Dirac equation]], making it amenable to the [[Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation|Foldy-Wouthuysen technique]].&lt;ref&gt;(Khan, 2006a, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is very similar to one developed for the quantum theory of charged-particle beam optics.&lt;ref&gt;(Jagannathan et al., 1989, Jagannathan, 1990, Jagannathan and Khan 1996, Khan, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

He was born March 5, 1940 in Skoplje. The war years he spent as a refugee with his mother (a teacher), and his sister in the areas around the Great Morava river, where he finished elementary school. In 1954 the whole family moved to [[Niš]], where he finished high school.

He graduated from the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law]] in 1963. For a time he studied Public International Law at the third instance of the same faculty. A member of the editorial board of the student culture periodical “Vidici”, he participated in the student uprising of 1968. His poem "March of the Red University" was multiplied in thousands of copies and adopted by acclamation at the Student Union at the Faculty of Philosophy as the anthem of the University of Belgrade.

In 1969 he founded the neo-avantgarde literary and artistic movement Signalism, and the following year he launched the International Review “Signal” publishing most important avant-garde authors [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[Augusto de Campos]], [[Michele Perfetti]], [[Adriano Spatola]], [[Clemente Padin]], [[Julien Blaine]], [[Sarenco]], [[Eugenio Miccini]], [[Richard Kostelanetz]], [[Guillermo Deisler]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Eugen Gomringer]], [[Pierre Garnier]], [[Enzo Minarelli]], [[Keiichi Nakamura]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Dmitry Bulatov (artist)|Dmitry Bulatov]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Shozo Shimamoto]], [[Klaus Peter Dencker]], [[Ruggero Maggi]], [[Daniel Daligand]], [[Willi R. Melnikov]], [[Kum-Nam Baik]], [[On Kawara]], [[Klaus Groh]] etc.

He worked as a journalist, a high school teacher, secretary of the editorial board, editor and advisor for Interstate and International Cultural Cooperation of the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Serbia. In 1982 he retired and fully devoted himself to literary and artistic work.

Poetry, essays, and intermedia works of Miroljub Todorović have been published in several languages: in anthologies, collections, catalogs, newspapers and magazines in Europe, North and South America, Australia, South Korea and Japan.

As an artist, he had a dozen solo exhibitions and participated in more than six hundred collective international exhibitions of drawings, collages, visual poetry, mail-art and conceptual art.

He is included in the biographical dictionary “Serbs Who Have Marked the Twentieth Century” (five hundred persons), Belgrade 2006.

On the work of Miroljub Todorović and Signalism movement that he had founded, three doctoral dissertations have been defended:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/signalizam/delo/11296 "Three dissertations about Signalism" (Biserka Rajčić: 'Kornhauser's study'; Dragoljub P.

'''''Modus vivendi''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase that means "mode of living" or “way of life”.  It often is used to mean an arrangement or agreement that allows conflicting parties to coexist in peace. In science it is used to describe [[Habit_(biology)#Behavior|lifestyles]].&lt;ref name="Stevenson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angus Stevenson|title=Oxford Dictionary of English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1139|date=19 August 2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-957112-3|pages=1139–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Modus'' means "mode", "way", "method", or "manner". ''Vivendi'' means "of living". The phrase is often used to describe informal and temporary arrangements in political affairs. For example, if two sides reach a ''modus vivendi'' regarding disputed territories, despite political, historical or cultural incompatibilities, an accommodation of their respective differences is established for the sake of contingency.

In diplomacy, a ''modus vivendi'' is an instrument for establishing an international accord of a temporary or provisional nature, intended to be replaced by a more substantial and thorough agreement, such as a [[treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/Overview.aspx?path=overview/definition/page1_en.xml#modus | title=United Nations Treaty Collection: Definitions | accessdate=19 May 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520185430/https://treaties.un.org/Pages/Overview.aspx?path=overview%2Fdefinition%2Fpage1_en.xml#modus | archivedate=20 May 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Armistice]]s and instruments of [[surrender (military)|surrender]] are intended to achieve a ''modus vivendi''.

==Examples==
In Season 1, Episode 25, of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'', entitled "[[The Devil in the Dark]]", Captain [[James T. Kirk]] used the term to describe a possible relationship between miners on a Federation planet and a rock tunneling indigenous species called '[[The Horta]]'. He said, "Seems to me we could make an agreement, reach a ''modus vivendi''. They tunnel, you collect and process, and your processing operation would be a thousand times more profitable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NBC Nightly News With Lester Holt |publisher=NBC |date=November 21, 2016 |url=https://archive.org/details/WRAL_20161121_233000_NBC_Nightly_News_With_Lester_Holt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term often refers to [[Anglo-French relations]] from the 1815 end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] to the 1904 [[Entente Cordiale]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

'''Multistable perception''' (or '''Bistable perception''') are a form of [[perceptual]] phenomena in which there are unpredictable sequences of spontaneous subjective changes. While usually associated with [[visual perception]] (a form of [[optical illusion]]), such phenomena can also be found for [[Sound|auditory]] and [[olfactory]] precepts.

== Classification ==
Perceptual [[multistability]] can be evoked by visual patterns that are too [[ambiguous]] for the human [[visual system]] to recognize with one unique interpretation. Familiar examples include the [[Necker cube]], [[Schroeder staircase]], [[structure from motion]], [[monocular rivalry]], and [[binocular rivalry]], but many more visually [[ambiguous image|ambiguous patterns]] are known. Since most of these images lead to an alternation between two mutually exclusive perceptual states, they are sometimes also referred to as bistable perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Eagleman | first = D. | title = Visual Illusions and Neurobiology | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | year = 2001 | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 920–926 | url = http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/papers/Eagleman.NatureRevNeuro.Illusions.pdf | format = pdf | doi = 10.1038/35104092 | pmid = 11733799 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212714/http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/papers/Eagleman.NatureRevNeuro.Illusions.pdf | archivedate = 2007-09-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characterization ==
Transitions from one precept to its alternative are called perceptual reversals. They are spontaneous and [[stochastic]] events which cannot be eliminated by intentional efforts, although some control over the alternation process is learnable. Reversal rates vary drastically between stimuli and observers, and have been found to be slower for people with [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pettigrew | first1 = J.

== Cultural history ==
Human interest in these phenomena can be traced back to [[Ancient history|antiquity]]. The fascination of multistable perception probably comes from the active nature of [[endogenous]] perceptual changes or from the dissociation of dynamic perception from constant sensory stimulation. 

Multistable perception was a common feature in the artwork of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[lithography|lithographer]] [[M. C. Escher]], who was strongly influenced by mathematical physicists such as [[Roger Penrose]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Real world examples ==
Photographs of craters, from either the moon or other planets including our own, can exhibit this phenomenon. Craters, in stereo imaging, such as our eyes, should appear to be pit-like structures. However, in mono-vision, such as that of photographs, the elimination of our depth perception causes multistable perception to take over, and this can cause the craters to invert their depth values and instead look like plateaus rather than pits.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Sometimes rotating the image so that the photographic direction of the source of light matches a light source in the room can cause the correct perception to suddenly switch.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In literature, the [[science fiction]] [[novel]], ''[[Dhalgren]]'', by [[Samuel R. Delany]], contains circular text, multistable perception, and multiple entry points.

Multistable perception arises with the theater segments of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', as due to the construction of the [[Crow T. Robot]] puppet, its head can appear to be facing towards the camera rather than towards the film being shown. This was addressed by the creators of the series, even likening Crow to a [[Necker cube]]&lt;ref name="necker"&gt;{{Cite journal | author-link = Best Brains | year = 1996 | title = The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide |page = 159 | publisher = Bantam | isbn = 0-553-37783-3 | author = Trace Beaulieu ... | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[The Spinning Dancer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7604">{{otheruses|Pneuma (disambiguation)}}
In [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophy]], '''pneuma''' ({{lang-grc-gre|πνεῦμα}}) is the concept of the "breath of life," a mixture of the [[Classical element#Classical elements in Greece|elements]] air (in motion) and fire (as warmth).&lt;ref&gt;"Stoicism," ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1998), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Originating among Greek medical writers who locate human vitality in the breath, pneuma for the Stoics is the active, generative principle that organizes both the individual and the [[cosmos]].&lt;ref&gt;David Sedley, "[[Stoicism#Stoic physics and cosmology|Stoic Physics]] and [[Metaphysics]]," ''The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy'', p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; In its highest form, the pneuma constitutes the human soul (''psychê''), which is a fragment of the pneuma that is the soul of God. As a force that structures [[matter]], it exists even in inanimate objects.&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'' (University of California Press, 2006), pp. 98-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levels of pneuma==
In the Stoic universe, everything is constituted of matter and pneuma. There are three grades or kinds of pneuma, depending on their proportion of fire and air.

* '''The pneuma of state or tension (''tonos'').''' This unifying and shaping pneuma provides stability or cohesion (''[[hexis]]'') to things; it is a force that exists even in objects such as a stone, log, or cup. The 4th-century Christian philosopher [[Nemesius]] attributes the power of pneuma in Stoic thought to its "tensile motion" (''tonicê kinêsis''); that is, the pneuma moves both outwards, producing [[Quantity#Background|quantity]] and [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]], and at the same time inwards, providing unity and substance. An individual is defined by the equilibrium of its inner pneuma, which holds it together and also separates it from the world around it.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. White, "Stoic Natural Philosophy (Physics and Cosmology)," p. 134, and Dorothea Frede, "Stoic Determinism," p. 186, both in ''The Cambridge Companion to the Stoics'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The pneuma as life force.''' The vegetative pneuma enables growth (''[[physis]]'') and distinguishes a thing as alive.
* '''The pneuma as soul.''' The pneuma in its most rarefied and fiery form serves as the animal soul (''psychê''); it pervades the organism, governs its movements, and endows it with powers of perception and reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of pneuma is related to [[Aristotle]]'s theory that the pneuma in sperm conveys the capacity for locomotion and for certain sensory perceptions to the offspring.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Solmsen]], "The Vital Heat, the Inborn Pneuma and the Aether," ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'' 77 (1957) 119–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fourth grade of pneuma may also be distinguished. This is the '''rational soul''' (''logica psychê'') of the mature human being, which grants the power of judgment.&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pneuma and cosmology==
In Stoic [[cosmology]], everything that exists depends on two first principles which can be neither created nor destroyed: matter, which is passive and inert, and the ''[[Logos#Use in ancient philosophy|logos]]'', or divine reason, which is active and organizing.&lt;ref&gt;Dirk Baltzly, "Stoicism," ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd-century B.C. Stoic [[Chrysippus]] regarded pneuma as the vehicle of ''logos'' in structuring matter, both in animals and in the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;David Sedley, "Stoic Physics and Metaphysics," ''The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy'', p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; Pneuma in its purest form can thus be difficult to distinguish from ''logos'' or the "constructive fire" (''pur technikon'')&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. White, "Stoic Natural Philosophy (Physics and Cosmology)," ''The Cambridge Companion to the Stoics'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 136. White suggests that a number of Stoic terms are used interchangeably, or with subtle contextual distinctions, for the principle that acts on and within the physical world: ''pur, to hêgemonikon, pneuma, theos, nous, sperma, hexis, tonikê kinêsis.''&lt;/ref&gt; that drives the cyclical generation and destruction of the Stoic cosmos. When a cycle reaches its end in conflagration (''[[ekpyrôsis]]''), the cosmos becomes pure pneuma from which it regenerates itself.&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoics conceived of the cosmos as a whole and single entity, a living thing with a soul of its own,&lt;ref&gt;David Sedley, "Stoic Physics and Metaphysics," ''The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy'',  p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt; a spherical continuum of matter held together by the orderly power of Zeus through the causality of the pneuma that pervades it. This divine pneuma that is the soul of the cosmos supplies the pneuma in its varying grades for everything in the world.&lt;ref&gt;David J. Furley, ''From Aristotle to Augustine'' (Routledge, 1999) p. 238; John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on Christianity==
In his Introduction to the 1964 book ''[[Meditations]]'', the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth discussed the profound impact of [[Stoicism]] on [[Christianity]]. In particular:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Another Stoic concept which offered inspiration to the Church was that of 'divine Spirit'. [[Cleanthes]], wishing to give more explicit meaning to [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno's]] 'creative fire', had been the first to hit upon the term ''pneuma'', or 'spirit', to describe it. Like fire, this intelligent 'spirit' was imagined as a tenuous substance akin to a current of air or breath, but essentially possessing the quality of warmth; it was immanent in the universe as God, and in man as the soul and life-giving principle. Clearly it is not a long step from this to the 'Holy Spirit' of Christian theology, the 'Lord and Giver of life', visibly manifested as tongues of fire at Pentecost and ever since associated – in the Christian as in the Stoic mind – with the ideas of vital fire and beneficient warmth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=25 &lt;!--|ISBN=978-0-140-44140-6 --&gt; |isbn=0-14044140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Jainism}}
In [[Jainism]], '''''Pratima''''' ({{lang-sa|प्रतिमा}}) is a step or a stage marking the spiritual rise of a [[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|lay person]] (''shravak''). There are eleven such steps called ''pratima''.&lt;ref&gt;Shravakachar Sangrah, Five Volumes, Hiralal Jain Shastri, Jain Sanskruti Samrakshak Sangh Solapur, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; After having passed the eleven steps, one is no longer a ''sravaka'', but a ''muni'' ([[Jain monasticism|monk]]).

Rules prescribed for laymen are divided into twelve ''vrata'' (vows) and eleven ''pratimas'' (steps){{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=77}} and are described in several codes of conduct ([[Ratnakaranda|''shravakacharas'']]).&lt;ref&gt;Jaina yoga: a survey of the mediaeval śrāvakācāras By R. Williams&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''pratimas'' are mentioned in several ancient texts like [[Ratnakaranda Shravakachara]] (2nd century A.D.).&lt;ref&gt;Upasakdashang aur uska Shravakachar, Subhash Kothari, Agam Ahimsa Samta Evam Prakrit Sansthan, Udaipur  1988&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eleven ''Pratima'' ==
The eleven stages (''pratima'') are:{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=83}}
#Darshan Pratima (Right perspective): The worship of the true God (i.e., tirthanhara,) guru (preceptor) and shastra (Scripture), and the avoidance of gambling, meat-eating, drinking (wine), adultery, hunting, thieving and debauchery.
#Vrat Pratima: The keeping of the twelve vows and the vow to observe [[sallekhana]] (at the end of one's life)
#Samayak Pratima (Periodic meditation): Engaging in meditation or worship on a regular basis. 
#Proshadhopvas Pratima (periodic fasting): fasting four times in a month.
#Sachitta Tyaga Pratima: not eating vegetables having the capacity to grow again.
#Ratribhukti Tyaga Pratima (or Diva Maithun Tyaga Pratima): Giving up eating during the night or coitus during the day.
#Brahmacharya Pratima (celibacy): abstaining from sex or related activity.
#Arambha Tyaga Pratima (giving up occupations): refraining from any activity to earn a living.
#Parigraha Tyaga Pratima (giving up possessions): detachment from most possessions.
#Anurnati Tyaga Pratima (giving up right to give permissions): refraining from giving orders or expressing consents in the family.
#Uddishta Tyaga Pratima: The complete renunciation of the householder’s life, retiring into a forest and adopting the rules laid down for the guidance of monks.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=84}}

Ashadhara in his Sagara-Dharmammrata (13th century) has groups the 11 steps into three ranks.

*Grahin (jaghanya: first to sixth pratima)
*Varnin (madhyama: seventh to ninth pratima): At this point the householder is termed a [[Varni]]. The pratimas are:
*Bhikshuka (uttama: tenth and eleventh pratima): At this point a person depends on others for daily survival.

Those who have ascended to the eleventh pratima are termed [[Kshullaka]] (with two articles of clothing) and [[Jain Muni|Ailaka]] (with only one piece of cloth) in the [[Digambara]] tradition. The eleventh pratima is termed Shramanabhuta Pratima (being almost like a Shramana) in the [[Svetambara]] tradition. The next step is that of a full [[Jain muni|Jain Muni]].

In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of [[determinism]].&lt;ref name="McKewan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-determinism.html |title=Some Varieties of Free Will and Determinism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=10 September 2009 |work=Philosophy 302: Ethics |publisher=philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=19 December 2012| quote=Predeterminism: the philosophical and theological view that combines God with determinism.

==Definitional difficulties==
Predeterminism is difficult to discuss because its simple definition can logically lead to a variety of similar, complex (and, perhaps, better defined) concepts in [[metaphysics]], [[theology]], and the philosophy of [[free will]]. The term ''predeterminism'' suggests not just a determining of all events, but the prior and deliberately conscious determining of all events (therefore done, presumably, by a conscious being). Due to this, predeterminism and the similar term [[predetermination]] are easily and often confused or associated with ideas ranging, for instance, from the [[Physicalism|physicalist]] (and often scientific) notion of ''[[causal determinism]]'' to even the theological (and often religious) notion of ''[[predestination]]''.

A [[secular]] example to try to illustrate predeterminism is that a fetus's future physical, emotional, and other personal characteristics as a matured human being may be considered "predetermined" by heredity, [[i.e.]] derived from a chain of events going back long before her eventual birth. However, one of the difficulties with defining predeterminism using this example is that the word ''predetermine'' necessarily implies a conscious being "doing" the determining ahead of time. With regards to predetermined heredity, a conscious being (perhaps a genetic scientist) is presumed to be the one speculating on what the fetus's personal characteristics will turn out to be, for example, based on looking at the genomes of the fetus and its ancestors. If there were not this conscious entity, the scientist, then one could say merely that the fetus's characteristics are ''determined'' by heredity, rather than ''pre''determined. Predeterminism necessarily implies, at the very least, a passive but all-knowing observer, if not an active planner, designer, or manipulator (of the fetus's personal characteristics). This basic scientific idea of hereditary determination, though, already fulfills the definition of [[causal determinism]], a metaphysical concept.

While determinism usually refers to a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistically]] explainable causality of events, predeterminism seems by definition to suggest a person or a "someone" who is controlling or planning the causality of events ''before'' they occur and who then perhaps resides beyond the natural, causal universe. This creates a definitional conflict because predeterminism, by this understanding, logically leads to a belief in the existence of a conscious being who must determine ''all'' actions and events in advance and who, possessing such seeming [[omnipotence]], almost certainly operates outside of the laws of nature. This conscious entity is probably, then, a being who is omnipotent as well as presumably [[supernatural]] and [[omniscient]]. The definitional confusion here is that there is already a name for this very concept: [[predestination]]. Predestination asserts that a supremely powerful being has, in advance, fixed all events and outcomes in the universe; it is a famous doctrine of the [[Calvinist]]s in [[Christian]] theology.

Likewise, the doctrine of [[fatalism]] already explicitly attributes all events and outcomes to the will of a (vaguer) higher power such as fate or destiny. Furthermore, in philosophic debates about the compatibility of [[free will]] and [[determinism]], some argue that ''predeterminism'' back to the origin of the universe is simply what philosophers mean by the more common term "determinism." Others have suggested that the term "[[self-determination]]" be used to describe actions as merely "determined" by an agent's reasons, motives, and desires.

When various interpretation of the word ''predeterminism'' can be defined even better by other terms, such as the aforementioned determinism, predestination, or fatalism, then the definition of predeterminism itself appears awkward, unclear, and perhaps even worthless in terms of practical or philosophic discussion.

==R. E. Hobart==

R. E. Hobart is the pseudonym of [[Dickinson S. Miller]], a student of [[William James]] who was later one of James' closest personal friends and for some years a colleague in the Harvard philosophy department. Hobart (Miller) criticized the core idea of James' ''The Will to Believe'', namely that it was acceptable to hold religious faith in the absence of evidence for or against that faith. James referred to Miller as "my most penetrating critic and intimate enemy."

Nearly 25 years after James' death, R. E. Hobart published a short article in ''Mind'' in 1934 that is considered one of the definitive statements of [[determinism]] and [[compatibilism]]. It was entitled ''Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It''.&lt;ref name="Hobart"&gt;R. E. Hobart "Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It," ''Mind'', Vol XLIII, No. 169, January, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobart's compatibilism was similar to earlier landmark positions by [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[David Hume]], as refined in the 19th-century compatibilist views of [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Henry Sidgwick]], and [[F. H. Bradley]]. But unlike them Hobart explicitly did not endorse ''strict'' logical or physical determinism, and he explicitly did endorse the existence of [http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/possibilities.html alternative possibilities], which can depend on absolute [[Randomness|chance]].

He was writing just a few years after the discovery of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[Indeterminacy principle|indeterminacy]], and also makes passing mention of the ancient "swerve" of the atoms espoused by [[Epicurus]]:

'I am not maintaining that determinism is true...it is not here affirmed that there are no small exceptions, no slight undetermined swervings, no ingredient of absolute chance.'&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

'"We say," I can will this or I can will that, whichever I choose". Two courses of action present themselves to my mind. I think of their consequences, I look on this picture and on that, one of them commends itself more than the other, and I will an act that brings it about. I knew that I could choose either. That means that I had the power to choose either.'&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt;{{rp|8}}

Hobart supports the existence of alternative possibilities for action and the capability to do otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/possibilities.html Alternative Possibilities]&lt;/ref&gt;

And he clearly prefers "determination" to "determinism." Hobart's article is frequently misquoted as "Free Will as Involving Determinism."&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [https://books.google.com/books?id=0ncN3TuDQ7cC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%22Free+Will+As+Involving+Determinism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3Q3OHYTn66&amp;sig=Rj7QYcAoy8x7oLrfDO9ZtACXhgk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Vqu6S7jgEcWqlAfc1-3XBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Free%20Will%20As%20Involving%20Determinism%22&amp;f=false Fischer and Ravizza, Perspectives on moral responsibility], and even in the [http://www.rep.routledge.com/article-bibliography/V014 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731000518/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article-bibliography/V014 |date=2009-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philippa Foot==

[[Philippa Foot]] is one who misquoted Hobart's title, but who had the same misgivings about determinism.

In 1957 she wrote an article in The Philosophical Review entitled "Free Will As Involving Determinism."

Nevertheless, she criticized arguments that free will requires indeterminism, and in particular the idea that one could not be held responsible for "chance" actions chosen for no particular reason.

Her article begins with the observation that determinism has become widely accepted as compatible with free will.

"The idea that free will can be reconciled with the strictest determinism is now very widely accepted. To say that a man acted freely is, it is often suggested, to say that he was not constrained, or that he could have done otherwise if he had chosen, or something else of that kind; and since these things could be true even if his action was determined it seems that there could be room for free will even within a universe completely subject to causal laws."&lt;ref name="Foot"&gt;Philippa Foot "Free Will As Involving Determinism," ''The Philosophical Review'', vol LXVI, (1957).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|439}}

Foot doubted that the ordinary language meaning of saying our actions are "determined" by motives has the same meaning as strict physical determinism, which assumes a causal law that determines every event in the future of the universe.

She notes that our normal use of "determined" does not imply universal determinism.

"For instance, an action said to be determined by the desires of the man who does it is not necessarily an action for which there is supposed to be a sufficient condition. In saying that it is determined by his desires we may mean merely that he is doing something that he wants to do, or that he is doing it for the sake of something else that he wants. There is nothing in this to suggest determinism in [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]'s sense."&lt;ref name="Foot"/&gt;{{rp|441}}

Foot cited Bertrand Russell's view of causal determinism:

"The law of universal causation . . . may be enunciated as follows:...given the state of the whole universe,...every previous and subsequent event can theoretically be determined."

[[Buddhism]] and many of its associated [[paradigm]]s emphasize the importance of living in the present moment — being fully aware of what is happening, and not dwelling on the [[past]] or worrying about the [[future]].&lt;ref&gt;Hạnh, Thích Nhất (1990).

=== Christianity and eternity ===
Christianity views [[God]] as being outside of time and, from the divine perspective past, present and future are actualized in the now of [[eternity]]. This trans-temporal conception of God has been proposed as a solution to the problem of divine foreknowledge (i.e. how can God know what we will do in the future without us being determined to do it) since at least [[Boethius]].&lt;ref&gt;Consolatio Philosophae, Bk. 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]] offers the metaphor of a watchman, representing God, standing on a height looking down on a valley to a road where past present and future, represented by the individuals and their actions strung out along its length, are all visible simultaneously to God.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, Austin.

==Physical science==

===Special relativity===

[[Image:World line.svg|250px|right|thumb|A visualisation of the present (dark blue plane) and past and future [[light cone]]s in 2D space.]] The original intent of the diagram on the right was to portray a 3-dimensional object having access to the past, present, and future in the present moment (4th dimension).{{clarify|date=March 2015}}
It [[Logical consequence|follows from]] [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[Special relativity|Special Theory of Relativity]] that there is [[Relativity of simultaneity|no such thing as absolute simultaneity]]. When care is taken to [[Operational definition|operationalise]] "the present", it follows that the events that can be labeled as "simultaneous" with a given event, can not be in [[Causality (physics)|direct cause-effect relationship]]. Such collections of events are perceived differently by different observers. Instead, when focusing on "now" as the events [[perception|perceived]] directly, not as a recollection or a speculation, for a given observer "now" takes the form of the observer's past [[light cone]]. The light cone of a given event is objectively defined as the collection of events in [[Causality (physics)|causal relationship]] to that event, but each event has a different associated light cone. One has to conclude that in relativistic models of physics there is no place for "the present" as an absolute element of reality. Einstein phrased this as: ''"People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion"''.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Einstein to the family of his lifelong friend [[Michele Besso]], after learning of his death, (March 1955) as quoted in ''Science and the Search for God: Disturbing the Universe'' (1979) by [[Freeman Dyson]], Ch. 17, "A Distant Mirror", &lt;!--p. 193--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/einsteinsgod/unheardcuts.shtml |title = Einstein's God (NPR) |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080105183119/http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/einsteinsgod/unheardcuts.shtml |archive-date = 5 January 2008 |access-date = 31 March 2018 |work = [[Speaking of Faith]] |last = Tippett |first = Krista |author-link = Krista Tippett |publisher = [[American Public Media]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmology===
{{further|Physical cosmology|Cosmic time|Chronology of the universe}}
In [[physical cosmology]], the present time in the [[chronology of the universe]] is estimated at 13.8 billion years after the [[Big Bang|singularity]] determining the [[arrow of time]].  
In terms of the [[metric expansion of space]], it is in the [[dark-energy-dominated era]], after the universe's matter content has become diluted enough for metric expansion to be dominated by [[vacuum energy]] ([[dark energy]]).  It is also in the universe's [[Stelliferous Era]], after enough time for [[supercluster]]s to have formed (at about 5 billion years), but before the [[accelerating expansion of the universe]] has removed the local supercluster beyond the [[cosmological horizon]] (at about 150 billion years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Krauss |first1 = Lawrence M. |last2 = Starkman |first2 = Glenn D. |year = 2000 |title = Life, the Universe, and Nothing: Life and Death in an Ever-expanding Universe |journal = Astrophysical Journal |volume = 531 |issue = 1 |pages = 22–30 |doi = 10.1086/308434 |bibcode = 2000ApJ...531...22K |arxiv = astro-ph/9902189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grammar ==
In [[Grammar]], actions are classified according to one of the following twelve verb tenses: past ([[past]], [[Uses of English verb forms#Past progressive|past continuous]], [[past perfect]], or [[past perfect continuous]]), present ([[present]], [[present continuous]], [[present perfect]], or [[present perfect continuous]]), or future ([[future]], [[future continuous]], [[future perfect]], or [[future perfect continuous]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present tense refers to things that are currently happening or are always the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the sentence, "she walks home everyday," the verb "walks" is in the present tense because it refers to an action that is regularly occurring in the present circumstances.

Verbs in the present continuous tense indicate actions that are currently happening and will continue for a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the sentence, "she is walking home," the [[verb phrase]] "is walking" is in the present continuous tense because it refers to a current action that will continue until a certain endpoint (when "she" reaches home). Verbs in the present perfect tense indicate actions that started in the past and is completed at the time of speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Merriam-Webster |title=Present Perfect |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/present%20perfect |website=Merriam-Webster.com |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=27 July 2018 |format=Web |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the sentence, "She has walked home," the verb phrase "has walked" is in the present perfect tense because it describes an action that began in the past and is finished as of the current reference to the action. Finally, verbs in the present perfect continuous tense refer to actions that have been continuing up until the current time, thus combining the characteristics of both the continuous and perfect tenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a present perfect continuous verb phrase can be found in the sentence, "she has been walking this route for a week now," where "has been walking" indicates an action that was happening continuously in the past and continues to happen continuously in the present.

A '''resident register''' is a [[government database]] which contains information on the current [[Residency (domicile)|residence]] of persons. In countries where registration of residence is compulsory, the current place of residence must be reported to the [[registration office]] or the [[police]] within a few days after establishing a new residence. In some countries, residence information may be obtained indirectly from [[voter registration|voter register]]s or registers of [[driver license]]s. Besides a formal resident registers or population registers, residence information needs to be disclosed in many situations, such as voter registration, passport application, and updated in relation to drivers licences, motor vehicle registration, and many other purposes. The [[Domicile (law)|permanent place of residence]] is a common criterion for taxation including the assessment of a person's [[income tax]].

== Africa ==

=== South Africa ===
[[South Africa]] introduced the ''Population Registration Act'' in 1950, which created a national population register, and required the classification of residents based on race, and the issuing of identity cards.{{sfn|Clark|Worger|2004|pp=46-47}} This system formed an important part in the [[pass laws]], one of the dominant features of South Africa's [[apartheid]] system, after the ''Native Laws Amendment Act'' and the ''Abolition of Passes and Co-ordination of Documents Act'' of 1952 regularized their use.{{sfn|Clark|Worger|2004|pp=46-47}} The apartheid system effectively ended in 1986.

== Americas ==

=== Canada ===
Canada does not have compulsory registration of residence, though residence information needs to be disclosed in many situations, such as voter registration, passport application, provincial health care card, and updated in relation to drivers licences, motor vehicle registration, and many other purposes.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

=== United States ===
Neither the [[federal government of the United States]] nor any [[U.S. state]] has formal resident registration systems. Refusing or neglecting to answer questions for the [[United States Census]], such as current address, is punishable by fines of $100, for a property or business agent to fail to provide correct names for the census is punishable by fines of $500, and for a business agent to provide false answers for the census is punishable by fines of $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|13|221}}-224&lt;/ref&gt; Registrants in the [[Selective Service System]] ([[conscription in the United States]]) must notify Selective Service within 10 days of any changes to any of the information he provided on his registration card, like a change of address.&lt;ref name="ack"&gt;[http://www.sss.gov/ack.htm Proof of Registration &amp; Change of Address], Selective Service System.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USCFR|32|1621|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[California]], anyone with a driver's license must notify [[California Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]] of a change of address within 10 days or face a typical fine of $214,&lt;ref&gt;California Vehicle Code § 14600&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sacgrandjury0910"&gt;[[Sacramento County, California|Sacramento County]] [[grand juries in the United States#California|Grand Jury]] [http://www.sacgrandjury.org/reports/09-10/Sac%20County%20Grand%20Jury%20Report%202010%20Complete.pdf 2009-2010 Final Report], pp. 171-173&lt;/ref&gt; and anyone who has applied for or received a [[vehicle registration]] must notify DMV of a change of address within 10 days or face a typical fine of $178.&lt;ref name="sacgrandjury0910"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;California Vehicle Code § 4159&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Voter registration in the United States|Voter registration]] has a residency requirement and is used for [[jury]] assignments and other government tasks.

A person's current address is often registered for state-issued [[identification card]]s and [[driver license]]s. In some jurisdictions a "non-driver's license" or "non-driver photo identification card" is issued as a document containing residence details. Each state has their own requirements for keeping documents up-to-date and may require persons moving into the state to obtain a driver's license from that state within a given period of time (generally 10–90 days).{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Aliens in the United States staying for more than thirty days are generally required to register with the Federal government pursuant to the [[Smith Act]] and carry proof of registration at all times; for permanent residents, the proof of registration comes in the form of a [[Permanent residence (United States)|Permanent Residence Card]] ("Green card") while, for other aliens, this can be in the form of either an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) or the [[I-94 (document)|I-94]] card together with a valid passport.

== Europe ==

=== European Union ===
Within the Europe Union a regulation for the European-wide [[census]] was agreed that allows for a ''register-based census'' that may use the continuously updated information from the national resident registers with a statistical correction drawn from a sample census performed at another magnitude of the census poll. The first register census was performed in 1981 in Denmark, joined later by other Nordic countries. Germany, Austria and Switzerland intend to use a register-based census model for the [[2011 European Union census|EU Census scheduled for 2011]].&lt;ref name="census-bw"&gt;[http://www.statistik-bw.de/Veroeffentl/Monatshefte/essay.asp?xYear=2006&amp;xMonth=06&amp;eNr=02 Statistische Monatshefte Baden-Württemberg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618135031/http://www.statistik-bw.de/Veroeffentl/Monatshefte/essay.asp?xYear=2006&amp;xMonth=06&amp;eNr=02 |date=2009-06-18 }}, issue 06/2006 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Given the financial benefit it is expected that more countries will switch to a register census model.

=== Austria ===
The residence reporting requirement ({{lang|de|Meldepflicht}}) requires a change of address to be registered and deregistered within 3 days.&lt;ref name="ummeldung-at"&gt;[http://zmr.bmi.gv.at/pages/meldepflicht.htm ZMR Meldepflicht], Bundesministerium des Innern&lt;/ref&gt; The current place of residence is reported by means of a registration form ({{lang|de|Meldezettel}}) sent to the local administrative authority ({{lang|de|Gemeindeamt}} or {{lang|de|Magistratisches Bezirksamt}} in cities).

On 1 March 2002 the regional resident registers were centrally stored on the newly established {{lang|de|Zentrales Melderegister}} (ZMR).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmi.gv.at/presse/2002-02-27.asp Pressekonferenz Zentrales Melderegister]. BM.I, 2002-02-27&lt;/ref&gt; Some larger cities continue to run their own local resident registers ({{lang|de|Lokales Melderegister}} or LMR), which are synchronized with the central database. A residence document from the database is called {{lang|de|Meldeauskunft}}, and includes information about third persons unless those have filed to restrict public access ({{lang|de|Auskunftsperre}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ris2.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Bundesnormen/NOR40050278/NOR40050278.html § 18 Meldegesetz]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006 the ZMR was extended to include additional personal details from the civil registers; It is envisaged to include records from even more government databases.

Permanent access to the ZMR is granted to some profession that require regular residence checks like lawyers, banks, professional associations and collection agencies.

=== Belgium ===
In Belgium, a change of address must be declared to the municipality within eight days of its occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.belgium.be/nl/huisvesting/verhuizen/adreswijziging|title=Adreswijziging|date=2015-03-10|newspaper=Belgium.be|language=nl|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.belgium.be/fr/logement/demenagement/changement_d_adresse|title=Changement d'adresse|date=2015-03-10|newspaper=Belgium.be|language=fr|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipality verifies the change of address by sending a police or municipal officer to the new address. If the change of residence is confirmed it is registered in the municipal and national registers and the resident or residents concerned must present themselves to the municipal administration to have their national identity card and any motor vehicle registration papers updated. The change of address is forwarded by the municipality to social security agencies.

=== Bosnia and Herzegovina ===
The compulsory resident register was handled separately by the regional offices even before Yugoslavia was split into sovereign states.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

=== Denmark ===
The compulsory resident register is run by the ''folkeregister'' which hands out a CPR-Number (Central Person Register number). Foreigners need to register when intending to stay longer than six months.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

=== Finland ===
The compulsory resident register is run by the [[Population Register Centre (Finland)|Population Register Centre]], a government agency that also hands out the [[National identification number#Finland|Personal Identity Code]], which consists of eleven characters: six digits for the birth date, one character for the birth century, three additional digits and a checksum character. Many companies and societies have registered for direct access to the resident register. Upon relocation, one only needs to declare the new address to the resident register and these companies will update their address registers accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vaestorekisterikeskus.fi/default.aspx?id=41 | title=Customers updating address information from the Population Information System | accessdate=September 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this makes it easier to handle the administrative tasks of taking a new home it has also been criticized for its lack of personal [[data privacy]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

=== France ===
France utilizes a [[national identity card (France)|national identity card]] ({{lang|fr|carte nationale d’identité sécurisée}} or CNIS), an official non-compulsory identity document. The address information on the card is merely derived from other documents like electricity bills. There is no requirement to notify change of address, which leads to the situation that the current address is often verified by showing bills relating to the current home.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

There are plans to introduce a new identity card ({{lang|fr|carte d'identité nationale électronique sécurisée}} or INES) that was to be implemented starting in 2007, but they are still in the legislative process. The scheme bears many similarities to the British ID card.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Germany ===
The resident registration is a task of the community which do often create a separate resident registration offices to run the resident register ({{lang|de|Einwohnermelderegister}} or {{lang|de|Melderegister}}). The resident register is a public register in Germany — within the limits of resident privacy ({{lang|de|Meldegeheimnis}}) laws and regulations. Since 2007 the registration office will electronically de-register at the registration office of the old residency. The concept of the registered primary residence ({{lang|de|[[Hauptwohnsitz]]}}) has special legal ramifications, primarily involving [[tax]].

Although Germany (similarly to Austria and Switzerland) has a strict registration system for centuries, there had been a strong opposition towards a single [[National identification number#Germany|identification number]]. All registration numbers were local to the [[Registration Office]] — even split within a single community to the office for civil register, tax office, etc. In 2008 a new system was introduced with a national tax payer number. It is still debated how much more information will be attached to the national identification number when the federal resident register is activated.

Contrary to popular belief, there is no central administration of resident registration in Germany. The exception is the registration of resident aliens (see [[Central Register of Foreign Nationals (Germany)]]). Registration is organized by 5283 local offices throughout Germany.&lt;ref name="Deutschland-Online"&gt;[https://archive.is/20110809101446/http://www.deutschland-online.de/DOL_Internet/broker.jsp?uMen=c9110eca-0f05-1114-fbf1-b1ac0c2f214a&amp;page=1&amp;pagesize=5&amp;_ic_menu=true&amp;all=true&amp;press=truevgl. BMI:''Bundesmelderegister'' auf Deutschland-Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2009, the legal requirements pertaining to resident registration were governed by [[States of Germany|state]] legislation, which differed in terms of the period allowed to register a change of address (immediately in [[Rheinland-Pfalz|RP]]; within 1 week in [[Baden-Württemberg|BW]], [[Bavaria|BY]], [[Hamburg|HH]], [[Hessen|HE]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|MV]], [[Niedersachsen|NI]], [[Nordrhein-Westfalen|NW]], [[Saarland|SL]], [[Sachsen-Anhalt|ST]], [[Thuringia|TH]]; and within two weeks in [[Berlin|BE]], [[Brandenburg|BB]], [[Bremen|HB]], [[Schleswig-Holstein|SH]], and [[Sachsen|SN]]). Each state was able to produce its own laws and regulations governing access to personal information in the register and the fees for providing a residency document ({{lang|de|Melderegisterauskunft}} for oneself or for a third person.

The "Federalism Reform", which became effective on 1 September 2006, has moved the legislation for resident registration to the federal level. The [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Ministry of the Interior]] was preparing a federal law to replace the state laws on resident registration which scheduled to get effective by 2010. The new law would assign that a Federal Resident Register (''Bundesmelderegister'') shall be created to be run in parallel with the local resident registers.&lt;ref name="Deutschland-Online"/&gt; The nationwide register shall assemble a number of personal identifying information drawing from multiple sources including resident registers, civil registers and taxation offices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datenschutzbeauftragter-online.de/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/bmr.pdf Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur Fortentwicklung des Meldewesens]&lt;/ref&gt; During a scandal with list brokers obtaining large amounts of addresses from catalog selling company databases in 2008, the coalition split up over the question — [[Brigitte Zypries]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]) opposed the plans of the ministry of interior led by [[Wolfgang Schäuble]] ([[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]). She proposed that the current local registration offices should be networked instead. In the new government of CDU and [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] the plans are blocked, as such a central database is in clear opposition to the FDP's aim to increase data privacy.

===Greece===
EU citizens who plan to reside in Greece for a period of more than 90 days are required to register themselves at the Department of Foreigners ({{lang-gr|Πίνακας Αδειών Αλλοδαπών/Διεύθυνση Αλλοδαπών}} located at the police stations, in the area of residency ({{lang-gr|Τμήμα Αλλοδαπών}}), where a Certificate of Registration ({{lang-gr|βεβαίωσης εγγραφής πολιτών της Ευρωπαϊκής Ένωση}}) in beige color is issued. According to the Greek law, EU citizens who do not register are subject to a fine. However, it is very rare that this certificate is ever requested. Some Greek authorities are not even aware of the European Union directive and do not know that this certificate exists. In many cases, the tax identification number (AFM) ({{lang-gr|(Αριθμός Φορολογικός Μητρώου (ΑΦΜ)}}) is used as proof of residency.
EU citizens living in Greece for more than 5 years can apply for Permanent Residence Certificate ({{lang-gr|Eγγραφο Πιστοποίησης Μόνιμης Διαμονής Πολίτη}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingincrete.net/ResidencePermit.html Residence / Registration Certificate in Greece]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hungary ===
The compulsory resident register is run by ''Központi Adatfeldolgozó, Nyilvántartó és Választási Hivatal, Igazgatási és Felügyeleti Föösztály'' in Budapest. Hungarian citizens will declare their residency to the local administration while foreigners will register in the immigration office.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Iceland ===
Iceland has a central register of residents. Registration is compulsory.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Italy ===
In Italy the registration of residence is compulsory and the records are kept on a decentralized system. Unlike other countries a reported place of residence is physically checked by government officials as well as the de-registration of a previous residence. Hence, the official confirmation may take up to four months. Residents moving to a new place of residence abroad are recorded as expatriates on the database "Anagrafe degli Italiani Residenti all'Estero (A.I.R.E.)" (Registry of Italians Resident Abroad).  When they return to Italy, they are de-registered from A.I.R.E and their new residence is registered by the local administrative authority.

A.I.R.E. enrolment is obligatory for citizens who take up residence in a foreign country for more than 12 months and for citizens residing abroad either as a result of being born there or having obtained Italian citizenship for any reason whatsoever. Enrolment in the A.I.R.E. is done by means of a declaration (special form available) made to the locally competent consular office within 90 days of transfer abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Registry of Italians Resident Abroad (A.I.R.E.)|url=http://www.esteri.it/mae/en/italiani_nel_mondo/serviziconsolari/aire.html/|website=Farnesina - Ministero degli Affari Esteri e della Cooperazione Internazionale|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Luxembourg ===
A change of address or move must be declared to the local authorities of the new place of residence within eight days (including arrivals by EU/EEA citizens). Non-EU citizens, however, must declare their arrival to the local authorities within three days, regardless of their intended duration of stay. A permanent or indefinite departure from Luxembourgish territory must also be declared to the local authorities no later than the day before the departure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guichet.public.lu/citoyens/fr/citoyennete/installation-demenagement-luxembourg/declaration-arrivee/depart-arrivee-commune/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Netherlands ===
The compulsory resident register was run by the ''Bureau Vestigingsregister'' in The Hague until 1994.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Since 1994 the Municipal Basic Administration of Personal Information (Gemeentelijke Basisadministratie Persoonsgegevens or GBA) is used.  This is a central database fed into by all Dutch municipalities.  All residents of the Netherlands (citizens and non-citizens alike) are required to register with their municipality.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Norway ===
The Norwegian register of residents is ''Det sentrale folkeregisteret (DSF)'', otherwise commonly called ''Folkeregisteret''. The English translation is the ''National Population Register''.

This register is compulsory for all inhabitants of Norway, but foreigners only need to register when they intend to stay longer than 3 months.

The [[Norwegian Tax Administration]] is responsible for ensuring that the register is complete and up-to-date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skatteetaten.no/en/Person/ | title=Skatteetaten - Person | accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Register contains the following person information: birth date, name, paternity and parental responsibility, residence address, marital status, possible death date, citizenship and several other information elements. It tracks both the current value of these elements and historical versions. It is also used as basis for the tax register, the electoral register and is used for population statistics. Information from the Register is used by most other government agencies, such as the [[Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration]] (NAV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skatteetaten.no/en/Person/National-Registry/This-is-the-National-Registry/ | title=Skatteetaten - This is the National Registry | accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Portugal ===
There is no resident register in Portugal.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Romania ===
Romania utilizes the national [[Romanian identity card|identity card]] ({{lang|ro|carte de identitate}} or CI) system, based on an official compulsory identity document for the registration of all residents. The service is locally administered under the co-ordination of the Directorate for Persons Record and Databases Management (from the Ministers of Administration and Interior). There is a requirement to notify any change of address.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Russian Federation ===

{{main|Registration in Russia}}

Residence registration is compulsory in Russian Federation. There are separate registers for [[Citizenship of Russia|Russian citizens]] and foreign citizens or stateless persons, both administered by the [[Main Directorate for Migration Affairs (Russia)|Main Directorate for Migration Affairs]] which is a department of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]]. Anyone may request address information for a specific person from these registers, but a consent for the address disclosure from the latter is obligatory and will be checked by the register operator.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gosuslugi.ru/ru/card/index.php?coid_4=3&amp;poid_4=89&amp;soid_4=294&amp;toid_4=484&amp;info_4=1&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases government offices will refuse to provide services to people who are not registered in districts where these offices are located, although the law does not allow to do so to people who are not registered at all.

Russian citizens must register their permanent residence within 7 days, temporary residence must be registered after staying in the same place for more than 90 days.

Foreign citizens and stateless persons who have residence permits are obliged to register their permanent residence within 7 days. Temporary residence of foreign citizens and stateless persons is registered on an application from their host (including an employer, hotel administration, etc.). Such an application should be filed within 7 days.

Applications are delivered to Main Directorate for Migration Affairs offices by communal services companies, by applicants themselves, by post or by means of electronic government.&lt;ref&gt;http://epgu.gosuslugi.ru/foreign/?userLang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian citizens who fail to register in time can be fined 2000-2500 rubles ($70–$80). Russian hosts who fail to register their foreign guests in time can be fined 2000-500000 rubles ($70–$17000). Foreign citizens who fail to register in time can be fined 2000-5000 rubles ($70–$170).

=== Serbia ===
The compulsory resident register was handled separately by the regional offices even before the Yugoslavia was split into sovereign states.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Sweden ===
The mandatory [[population registration in Sweden|Swedish population register]] ({{lang|sv|folkbokföringsregister}}) is administered by the [[Swedish Tax Agency]] ({{lang|sv|Skatteverket}}), which also administers the [[personal identity number (Sweden)|Swedish personal identity number]] ({{lang|sv|personnummer}}), the [[national identification number]].

Almost all companies have registered for direct access to the resident register like telephone companies, electricity companies and so on. This leads to the situation that upon relocation one does only need to declare the new address to the resident register and all bills will be rerouted automatically to the new location. Although this makes it easier to handle the administrative tasks of taking a new home it has also been criticized for its lack of personal [[data privacy]].{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Switzerland and Liechtenstein ===
The compulsory resident registration is called ''Einwohnerkontrolle'' (residents' control) in Liechtenstein and the German-speaking parts of Switzerland. The residents' registers are subject to the local authority named ''Einwohneramt'' (residency office), ''Einwohnerkontrolle'' (residents registry office) or ''Personenmeldeamt'' (persons' registration office). Foreign residents are subject to the federal residents' register run by the immigration office. Each relocation must be declared to the residents' register including notice of departure when moving abroad.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom there is no resident registration as such. The head of a household is required to [[voter registration|register]] eligible voters in the household, although mandatory individual registration pursuant to the [[Political Parties and Elections Act 2009]] is planned;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Individual voter ID plan brought forward to 2014 | date= 15 September 2010 | work= [[BBC News]] | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11312362}}&lt;/ref&gt; registration is mandatory pursuant to section 23 of the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2001/341/regulation/23/ Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001 (No. 341)]. Completion of the [[Census in the United Kingdom|Census]] is mandatory pursuant to section 8 of the [[Census Act 1920]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= 120 people convicted for not filling in census form | first= Dan | last= Glaister | work= BBC News | date= 27 January 2012 | url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/27/120-convicted-census-forms-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Identity Cards Act 2006]] provided for the introduction of British ID cards which were to be linked to a system of resident registration which would also contain any information deemed necessary by the government; however, following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]] this scheme was abolished by the [[Identity Documents Act 2010]].

== Asia and Oceania ==

=== Australia ===
Australia does not have compulsory registration of residence, though residence information needs to be disclosed in many situations, such as voter registration, passport application, state health care card, and updated in relation to drivers licences, motor vehicle registration, and many other purposes.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== China ===
In China the [[Hukou system]] is used for resident registration and civil registration. This system was inherited from imperial times and there is an interest to reform the legislation about it.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Japan ===
In Japan the ''[[koseki]]'' system is used to record Japanese families and the ''[[juminhyo]]'' system is used to record individual residents. Foreigners need to register within 90 days under the premises of the laws for [[alien registration in Japan]] that creates a separate database for alien residents.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

The [[Residents Basic Registry Network]] or "Juki Net“ was introduced in 2003. This is introduced to increase government efficiency with 264 government tasks to be attached to the new system. In the new system a [[National identification number|person identification number]] is handed out consisting of eleven digits that can be used as a replacement for other identification documents.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan the [[NADRA]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nadra.gov.pk&lt;/ref&gt; system is used to record Pakistani families and the District Council system is used to record individual residents. Foreigners need to register within 90 days under the premises of the laws for alien registration in Pakistan that creates a separate database for alien residents.

=== South Korea ===
The [[resident registration number (South Korea)|resident registration number in South Korea]] consist of 13 digits that is also shown on the ID cards. Foreigners will receive a replacement number on their alien registration cards. The usage of the registration number is abundant including one third of the national internet websites require sign-up with the registration number and another third being unable to accept the alien registration card number.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2010/01/19/2010011900857.html "Korean Websites Try Patience of Foreigners"], Park Hae-hyun, published in Chosun Ilbo, Jan. 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Assmann''' (Anglicized spelling of the German name '''Richard Aßmann'''); (13 April 1845 in [[Magdeburg]] – 28 May 1918 in [[Gießen]]) was a German [[meteorologist]] and physician who was a native of [[Magdeburg]]. He made numerous contributions in high altitude research of the Earth's atmosphere. He was a pioneer of scientific [[aeronautics]] and considered a co-founder of [[aerology]].&lt;ref name=MA&gt;[http://www.uni-magdeburg.de/mbl/Biografien/1452.htm Magdeburger Biographischen Lexikon] (biography)&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1868 he received his medical doctorate in [[Berlin]], and from 1870 to 1879 was a [[general practitioner]] in [[Bad Freienwalde]]. In 1879 he returned to Magdeburg to practice medicine. In 1885 he earned a doctorate in secondary studies at the Faculty of Philosophy at the [[University of Halle]], and subsequently became a scientific officer at the Royal Meteorological Institute at [[Berlin-Grünau]]. From 1905 to 1914 Assmann was director of the Prussian Royal Aeronautical Observatory at [[:de:Meteorologisches Observatorium Lindenberg|Lindenberg]], and afterwards was an honorary professor at the [[University of Giessen]].

From 1887 to 1892, with airship designer Rudolf Hans Bartsch von Sigsfeld (1861–1902), he developed a [[psychrometer]] for accurate measurement of atmospheric [[humidity]] and temperature. This was the first instrument that was able to provide reliable temperature readings with high altitude balloons, as it was capable of shielding its thermometric elements from [[solar radiation]]. The technical implementation and production of this device took place in the factory of Rudolf Fuess (1838–1917).
[[File:Psychrometer.jpg|left|thumb|Threefold aspiration-psychrometer (Assmann type, prior to 1900)]]
From 1888 to 1899, he was a member of the ''Verein zur Förderung der Luftschifffahrt'', from which he organized [[Berlin scientific balloon flights|scientific balloon ascents]] in order to study the atmosphere. From these studies, valuable insights in regards to [[atmospheric stratification]] of the [[troposphere]] were made.&lt;ref name=MA/&gt; He is also credited for popularizing the field of meteorology, and played a significant role in several scientific newspapers and magazines during his career. From 1884 until his death, Assmann published the popular monthly magazine ''Das Wetter'' (The Weather).&lt;ref name=MA/&gt; 

With [[Léon Teisserenc de Bort]] (1855–1913), he is credited as co-discoverer of the [[stratosphere]], as both men announced their discovery during the same time period in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OlckxY7BA_0C&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=Assman+stratosphere&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YN13AEOnkN&amp;sig=zwpdSVh0OW6UUToQoFzETgIudUc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=H9feTuOkCYiQiAL4qfHPCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Assman%20stratosphere&amp;f=false] Ultraviolet radiation in the solar system By Manuel Vázquez, Arnold Hanslmeier&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1903, with meteorologist [[Arthur Berson]] (1859–1942), he was awarded the [[Buys Ballot Medal]] by the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences|Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences]].

The '''right to homeland''' is according to some legal scholars a universal [[human right]], which is derived from the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], including its Article 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Alfred-Maurice |last=de Zayas |title=International Law and Mass Population Transfers |journal=Harvard International Law Journal |year=1975 |pages=207–258}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Alfred-Maurice |last=de Zayas |title=The Right to One's Homeland, Ethnic Cleansing and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia |journal=Criminal Law Journal |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept evolved in German jurisprudence and is recognized in German constitutional law to a certain degree. Notable proponents of the concept include legal scholars [[Kurl Rabl]], [[Rudolf Laun]], [[Otto Kimminich]], [[Dieter Blumenwitz]], [[Felix Ermacora]] and [[Alfred-Maurice de Zayas]]. The concept is relevant to debates concerning [[ethnic cleansing]] in Europe after [[World War II]] (notably of Germans and Hungarians), ethnic cleansing in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Cyprus]] and other areas.

In [[economics]] and [[finance]], '''risk neutral preferences''' are [[preference (economics)|preferences]] that are neither [[risk aversion|risk averse]] nor [[risk seeking]]. A risk neutral party's decisions are not affected by the degree of uncertainty in a set of outcomes, so a risk neutral party is indifferent between choices with equal expected payoffs even if one choice is riskier. For example, if offered either $50 or a 50% chance each of $100 and $0, a risk neutral person would have no preference. In contrast, a risk averse person would prefer the first offer, while a risk seeking person would prefer the second.

==Theory of the firm==

In the context of the [[theory of the firm]], a risk neutral firm facing risk about the market price of its product, and caring only about profit, would maximize the expected value of its profit (with respect to its choices of labor input usage, output produced, etc.). But a risk averse firm in the same environment would typically take a more cautious approach.&lt;ref&gt;Sandmo, Agnar. "On the theory of the competitive firm under price uncertainty," ''[[American Economic Review]]'' 61, March 1971, 65-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portfolio theory==

In [[Modern portfolio theory|portfolio choice]],&lt;ref&gt;Edwin J. Elton and Martin J. Gruber, "Modern portfolio theory, 1950 to date", ''Journal of Banking and Finance'' 21, 1997, 1743-1759.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markowitz, H.M. ''Portfolio Selection: Efficient Diversification of Investments'', 1959.  New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons. http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cm/m16/index.htm.  (reprinted by Yale University Press, 1970, {{ISBN|978-0-300-01372-6}}; 2nd ed. Basil Blackwell, 1991, {{ISBN|978-1-55786-108-5}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merton, Robert. "An analytic derivation of the efficient portfolio frontier," ''[[Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis]]'' 7, September 1972, 1851-1872.&lt;/ref&gt; a risk neutral investor who is able to choose any combination of an array of risky assets (various companies' stocks, various companies' bonds, etc.) would invest exclusively in the asset with the highest [[expected value|expected]] yield, ignoring its risk features relative to those of other assets, and would even [[short selling|sell short]] the asset with the lowest expected yield as much as is permitted in order to invest the proceeds in the highest expected-yield asset.  In contrast, a risk averse investor would [[Diversification (finance)|diversify]] among a variety of assets, taking account of their risk features, even though doing so would lower the expected return on the overall portfolio.  The risk neutral investor's portfolio would have a higher expected return, but also a greater variance of possible returns.

==The risk neutral utility function==

Choice under uncertainty is often characterized as the maximization of [[expected utility]].  Utility is often assumed to be a function of profit or final portfolio wealth, with a positive first [[derivative]].  The utility function whose expected value is maximized is [[concave function|concave]] for a risk averse agent, [[convex function|convex]] for a risk lover, and linear for a risk neutral agent.  Thus in the risk neutral case, expected utility of wealth is simply equal to a linear function of expected wealth, and maximizing it is equivalent to maximizing expected wealth itself.

[[File:Shout gnangarra.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A round or Shout of drinks arriving at the table]]

A '''round of drinks''' is a set of [[alcoholic beverage]]s purchased by one person in a group for that complete group. The purchaser buys the round of drinks as a single order at the bar. In many places it is customary for people to take turns buying rounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sirc.org/publik/pub.html  SIRC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roundrules.com  Round Rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a nearly [[wiktionary:ubiquitous|ubiquitous]] custom in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Australia]].  In Australia and New Zealand it is referred to as '''shouting'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianbeers.com/culture/shouting.htm|title=Shouting|work=australianbeers.com|accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This practice is also customary in many parts of [[North America]], especially in areas where people with cultural roots in Ireland and the UK predominate.
A notable exception was the UK [[State Management Scheme]] in which treating (i.e. buying a round) was forbidden, from July 1916 until June 1919.

==Australia==
In [[John O'Grady (writer)|John O'Grady]]'s ''[[They're a Weird Mob]]'', Nino learns some customs related to shouting.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Your turn.''
:''What is my turn?''
Your turn to shout''
:''Why should I shout?''
Because I shouted you.''
:''I did not hear you shout at me.''
He thought for a while and said, I get it. When you buy a bloke a beer, it's called a shout, see?''
:''Why is that?''
I haven't a clue, but that's what it's called. I shouted for you, now it's your turn to shout for me.''
:''I was only a little thirsty. I do not think I wish another drink.''
He looked quite stern, In this country, if you want to keep out of trouble, you always return a shout, see?''
:''Is this the custom?''
Bloody oath, it's the custom. Your turn.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==United States==
In the culture of the [[United States Military]], possession of a [[challenge coin]] can be used to determine who buys a round of drinks.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} One individual of a group lays down their coin, and all else present must lay down their coins as well. Anyone who does not have a coin with them must buy a round. If everyone can produce a coin, the challenger must buy a round.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19873">'''Self-deception''' is a process of [[denial|denying]] or [[rationalization (psychology)|rationalizing]] away the relevance, significance, or importance of opposing [[evidence]] and [[logical argument]]. Self-deception involves convincing oneself of a truth (or lack of truth) so that one does not reveal any [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]] of the [[deception]].

== Brief History ==
While Freudian analysis of the conscious and the unconscious minds dominated the field, more and more psychological scientists became curious about how those two seemingly separate worlds could work together in the 70s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gur|first=Ruben C.|last2=Sackeim|first2=Harold A.|authorlink2=Harold A. Sackeim|date=1979|title=Self-deception: A concept in search of a phenomenon.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.37.2.147|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=147–169|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.37.2.147|issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the lack of mechanistic models available to this line of research, the debate was put on pause. Later, the focus has been shifted to vision-related research in social psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balcetis|first=Emily|date=January 2008|title=Where the Motivation Resides and Self-Deception Hides: How Motivated Cognition Accomplishes Self-Deception|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2007.00042.x|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=361–381|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2007.00042.x|issn=1751-9004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theorization==

===Analysis===
The traditional paradigm of self-deception is modeled after ''interpersonal'' deception, where ''A'' intentionally gets ''B'' to believe some proposition ''p'', all the while knowing or believing truly &amp;not;''p'' (not ''p'').&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt; Such deception is intentional and requires the deceiver to know or believe &amp;not;''p'' and the deceived to believe ''p''. On this traditional mode, self-deceivers must (1) hold contradictory beliefs and (2) intentionally get themselves to hold a belief they know or believe truly to be false.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{Cite SEP |url-id=self-deception |title=Self-Deception |last=Deweese-Boyd|first= Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of [[rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]], however, can obscure the intent of self-deception. Brian McLaughlin illustrates that such rationalizations in certain circumstances permit the phenomenon. When a person, who disbelieves ''p'', intentionally tries to make himself believe or continue believing ''p'' by engaging in such activities, and, as a result unintentionally misleads himself into believing or continuing to believe ''p'' via biased thinking, he deceives himself in a way appropriate for self-deception. No deceitful intention is required for this.&lt;ref&gt;"Exploring the Possibility of Self-Deception in Belief" by Brian P. McLaughlin. [[PhilPapers]]: [http://philpapers.org/rec/MCLETP MCLETP]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
Self-deception calls into question the nature of the individual, specifically in a [[psychology|psychological]] context and the nature of "self". Irrationality is the foundation upon which the argued paradoxes of self-deception stem, and it is argued&lt;sup&gt;[[Wikipedia:WEASEL|[weasel word]]]&lt;/sup&gt; that not everyone has the "special talents" and capacities for self-deception.&lt;ref&gt;"The Deceptive Self: Liars, Layers, and Lairs" by Amélie Oksenberg Rorty. [[PhilPapers]]: [http://philpapers.org/rec/RORTDS-2 RORTDS-2]&lt;/ref&gt; However, rationalization is influenced by a myriad of factors, including socialization, personal biases, fear, and cognitive repression. Such rationalization can be manipulated in both positive and negative fashions; convincing one to perceive a negative situation optimistically and vice versa. In contrast, rationalization alone cannot effectively clarify the dynamics of self-deception, as reason is just one adaptive form mental processes can take.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnston|first1=Mark|title=Philosophy of Psychology: Debates on Psychological Explanation|date=1995|publisher=Blackwell|location=Cambridge|pages=63–91|chapter=Self-Deception and the Nature of Mind}} [[PhilPapers]]: [http://philpapers.org/rec/JOHSAT JOHSAT]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paradoxes===
The works of philosopher [[Alfred Mele|Alfred R. Mele]] have provided insight into some of the more prominent paradoxes regarding self-deception. Two of these paradoxes include the self-deceiver's state of mind and the dynamics of self-deception, coined the "static" paradox and the "dynamic/strategic" paradox, respectively.

Mele formulates an example of the "static" paradox as the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If ever a person ''A'' deceives a person ''B'' into believing that something, ''p'', is true, ''A'' knows or truly believes that ''p'' is false while causing ''B'' to believe that ''p'' is true. So when ''A'' deceives ''A'' (i.e., himself) into believing that ''p'' is true, he knows or truly believes that ''p'' is false while causing himself to believe that ''p'' is true. Thus, ''A'' must simultaneously believe that ''p'' is false and believe that ''p'' is true. But how is this possible?&lt;ref name="Mele"&gt;''Two Paradoxes of Self-Deception'' by Alfred R. Mele. [[PhilPapers]]: [http://philpapers.org/rec/MELTPO-5 MELTPO-5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mele then describes the "dynamic/strategy" paradox:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In general, ''A'' cannot successfully employ a deceptive strategy against ''B'' if ''B'' knows ''A'''s intention and plan. This seems plausible as well when ''A'' and ''B'' are the same person. A potential self-deceiver's knowledge of his intention and strategy would seem typically to render them ineffective. On the other hand, the suggestion that self-deceivers typically successfully execute their self-deceptive strategies without knowing what they are up to may seem absurd; for an agent's effective execution of his plans seems generally to depend on his cognizance of them and their goals. So how, in general, can an agent deceive himself by employing a self-deceptive strategy?&lt;ref name="Mele"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These models call into question how one can simultaneously hold contradictory beliefs ("static" paradox) and deceive oneself without rendering one's intentions ineffective ("dynamic/strategic" paradox). Attempts at a resolution to these have created two schools of thought: one that maintains that paradigmatic cases of self-deception are intentional and one that denies the notion—''intentionalists'' and ''non-intentionalists'', respectively.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;

Intentionalists tend to agree that self-deception is intentional, but divide over whether it requires the holding of contradictory beliefs.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt; This school of thought incorporates elements of temporal partitioning (extended over time to benefit the self-deceiver, increasing the chance of forgetting the deception altogether) and psychological partitioning (incorporating various aspects of the "self").

Non-intentionalists, in contrast, tend to believe that cases of self-deception are not necessarily accidental, but motivated by desire, anxiety, or some other emotion regarding ''p'' or related to ''p''.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt; This notion distinguishes self-deception from misunderstanding. Furthermore, "wishful thinking" is distinguished from self-deception in that the self-deceivers recognize evidence against their self-deceptive belief or possess, without recognizing, greater counterevidence than wishful thinkers.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;

Numerous questions and debates remain in play with respect to the paradoxes of self-deception, and a consensual paradigm has yet to appear.

===Trivers' theory===
It has been theorized that humans are susceptible to self-deception because most people have emotional attachments to beliefs, which in some cases may be [[irrational]]. Some [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary]] biologists, such as [[Robert Trivers]], have suggested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=By3I9jsoBQkC |title=Natural Selection and Social Theory: Selected Papers of Robert Trivers  |first=Robert |last=Trivers |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press US |isbn=978-0-19-513062-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page number needed|date=June 2016}} that [[deception]] plays a significant part in human behavior, and in animal behavior, more generally speaking. One deceives oneself to trust something that is not true as to better convince others of that truth. When a person convinces himself of this untrue thing, they better mask the signs of deception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Foreword|first=Robert |last=Trivers |editor-last1=Dawkins|editor-first1=Richard|title=The Selfish Gene|date=1976|publisher=Oxford University Press|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZ9HDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR26|language=en|titlelink=The Selfish Gene|OCLC=2681149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This notion is based on the following [[logic]]: deception is a fundamental aspect of communication in nature, both between and within species. It has evolved so that one can have an advantage over another. From alarm calls to mimicry, animals use deception to further their survival. Those who are better able to perceive deception are more likely to survive. As a result, self-deception evolved to better mask deception from those who perceive it well, as Trivers puts it: "Hiding the truth from yourself to hide it more deeply from others." In humans, [[awareness]] of the fact that one is acting deceptively often leads to tell-tale signs of deception, such as nostrils flaring, clammy skin, quality and tone of voice, eye movement, or excessive blinking. Therefore, if self-deception enables someone to believe her or his own distortions, they will not present such signs of deception and will therefore appear to be telling the truth.

Self-deception can be used both to act greater or lesser than one actually is. For example, one can act overconfident to attract a mate or act under-confident to avoid a predator or threat. If a person is capable of concealing their true feelings and intentions well, then they are more likely to successfully deceive others.

It may also be argued that the ability to deceive, or self-deceive, is not the selected trait but a by-product of a more primary trait called [[abstract thinking]]. Abstract thinking allows many evolutionary advantages such as more flexible, adaptive behaviors and innovation. Since a lie is an [[abstraction]], the mental process of creating a lie can only occur in animals with enough brain complexity to permit abstract thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abe|first=Nobuhito|last2=Okuda|first2=Jiro|last3=Suzuki|first3=Maki|last4=Sasaki|first4=Hiroshi|last5=Matsuda|first5=Tetsuya|last6=Mori|first6=Etsuro|last7=Tsukada|first7=Minoru|last8=Fujii|first8=Toshikatsu|date=2008-12-01|title=Neural Correlates of True Memory, False Memory, and Deception|url=https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/18/12/2811/360672|journal=Cerebral Cortex|language=en|volume=18|issue=12|pages=2811–2819|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhn037|issn=1047-3211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, self-deception lowers cognitive cost; that is to say, if one has convinced oneself that that very thing is indeed true, it is less complicated for one to behave or think in a certain manner. The mind will not have to think constantly of the true thing and then the false thing, but simply convince itself that the false thing is true.

====Evolutionary implications====
Because there is deceit, there exists a strong selection to recognize when deception occurs. As a result, self-deception evolves so as to better hide the signs of deception from others. The presence of deception explains the existence of an innate ability to commit self-deception to hide the indications of deceptions. Humans deceive themselves in order to better deceive others and thus have an advantage over them. In the three decades since Trivers introduced his adaptive theory of self-deception, there has been an ongoing debate over the question of such behavior having a genetic basis.

The explanation of deception and self-deception as innate characteristics is perhaps true, but there are many other explanations for this pattern of behavior. It is possible that the ability to self-deceive is not innate, but a learned trait, acquired through experience. For example, a person could have been caught being deceitful by revealing their knowledge of information they were trying to hide. Their nostrils flared, indicating that they were lying to the other person, and thus did not get what they wanted. Next time, to better achieve success, the person will more actively deceive himself of having knowledge to better hide the signs of deception. People, therefore, could have the capacity to learn self-deception. However, simply because something is learned does not mean that it is not innate; what is learned and what is innate work in conjunction&lt;ref&gt;Barkow, Tooby, &amp; Cosmides. (1995). The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture.&lt;/ref&gt; . This is outlined in many introductory textbooks in evolutionary psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Barkow, Tooby, &amp; Cosmides. (1995). The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture.&lt;/ref&gt; . For example, [[preparedness (learning)]] occurs in learning to explain why some behaviours are more easily learned in others. Certain attributes, while they may be learned, are also innate.&lt;ref&gt;Barkow, Tooby, &amp; Cosmides. (1995). The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture.&lt;/ref&gt; . Evolutionary psychologists argue that there are learning mechanisms that allow learning to occur&lt;ref&gt;Barkow, Tooby, &amp; Cosmides. (1995). The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture.&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, while self-deception may be learned, this does not negate that is evolutionary nor genetic.&lt;ref&gt;Barkow, Tooby, &amp; Cosmides. (1995). The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
Self-deception has a prominent role in several medical conditions, such as [[borderline personality disorder]], [[narcissistic personality disorder]], and [[histrionic personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="Ford 1999 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Ford | first=Charles | title=Lies!, lies!!, lies!!! : The psychology of deceit | publisher=American Psychiatric Press | location=Washington, DC | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-88048-997-3 | page=103-125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Simple instances of self-deception include common occurrences such as: the alcoholic who is self-deceived in believing that his drinking is under control, the husband who is self-deceived in believing that his wife is not having an affair, the jealous colleague who is self-deceived in believing that her colleague's greater professional success is due to ruthless ambition.

An example of self-deception is provided by [[Robert Trivers]] and [[Huey P. Newton]] published&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Trivers|first1=R. L.|last2=Newton|first2=H. P.|title=The crash of Flight 90: Doomed by self-deception?|journal=[[Science Digest]]|date=November 1982|volume=90|issue=11|pages=66-67,111|url=http://roberttrivers.com/Publications_files/T%26Newton1982article-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of an analysis of the role of flight crew self-deception in the crash of [[Air Florida Flight 90]].

==Criticisms==
The claim that not being conscious about deception would decrease the body language signs of lying is criticized for being incompatible with the unconscious nature of body language as in body language giving away non-conscious processes, as well as for not being able to account for why evolutionary selection for lying would allow a body language that gives away lying to exist instead of simply selecting for lack of such signals.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Ekman - 2006 - Darwin and Facial Expression: A Century of Research in Review&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dylan Evans, Pierre Cruse - 2004 - Emotion, Evolution, and Rationality&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion that non-conscious deception would be less costly than conscious deception is subject to criticism, citing that a non-conscious lie followed by a process of creating a conscious [[confabulation]] would amount to more, not fewer, brain processes than simply making up a conscious lie.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Over - 2004 - Evolution and the Psychology of Thinking: The Debate&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of self-deception is criticized for being able to classify any criticism of the notion of self-deception as being self-deception in itself, removing its [[falsifiability]] and therefore making it unscientific, and also for being an obstacle to science in general by being able to classify anything as self-deception in a way that confirms itself in a way that is not self-correcting.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Flynn - 2007 - The New Encyclopedia of Unbelief&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2005 - The Skeptical Inquirer&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sentience''' is the capacity to [[feeling|feel]], [[perception|perceive]] or [[subjectivity|experience subjectively]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sentience&lt;/ref&gt; Eighteenth-century philosophers used the concept to distinguish the ability to think (''[[reason]]'') from the ability to feel (''sentience''). In modern Western philosophy, sentience is the ability to experience [[sensation (psychology)|sensations]] (known in [[philosophy of mind]] as "[[qualia]]"). In Eastern philosophy, sentience is a metaphysical quality of all things that require respect and care. The concept is central to the philosophy of [[animal rights]] because sentience is necessary for the ability to [[suffering|suffer]], and thus is held to [[logical consequence|confer]] certain rights.

==Philosophy and sentience==
In the philosophy of [[consciousness]], ''sentience'' can refer to the ability of any entity to have subjective perceptual experiences, or as some philosophers refer to them, "[[qualia]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is distinct from other aspects of the [[mind]] and consciousness, such as [[creativity]], [[intelligence]], [[sapience]], [[self-awareness]], and [[intentionality]] (the ability to have thoughts about something). Sentience is a minimalistic way of defining ''consciousness'', which otherwise commonly and collectively describes sentience plus other characteristics of the mind.

Some philosophers, notably [[Colin McGinn]], believe that sentience will never be understood, a position known as "[[new mysterianism]]". They do not deny that most other aspects of consciousness are subject to scientific investigation but they argue that [[qualia|subjective experiences]] will never be explained; i.e., sentience is the ''only'' aspect of consciousness that can't be explained. Other philosophers (such as [[Daniel Dennett]], who also argues that non-human animals are not sentient) disagree, arguing that all aspects of consciousness will eventually be explained by science.&lt;ref name="Ransey"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Eliminative Materialism | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | publisher=Stanford University | accessdate=19 June 2014 | author=Ramsey, William | editor=Zalta, Edward N. | year=2013 | edition=Summer 2013 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/materialism-eliminative/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian religions==
{{See also|Sentient beings (Buddhism)}}
Eastern religions including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]], and [[Jainism]] recognise [[non-human]]s as sentient beings. In Jainism and Hinduism, this is closely related to the concept of [[ahimsa]], nonviolence toward other beings. In Jainism, all matter is endowed with sentience; there are five degrees of sentience, from one to five.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Water, for example, is a sentient being of the first order, as it is considered to possess only one sense, that of touch. Man is considered a sentient being of the fifth order. According to Buddhism, sentient beings made of pure consciousness are possible. In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, which includes [[Zen]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the concept is related to the [[Bodhisattva]], an enlightened being devoted to the liberation of others. The first [[Bodhisattva vows|vow]] of a Bodhisattva states: "Sentient beings are numberless; I vow to free them."

[[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|Sentience in Buddhism]] is the state of having senses (''sat + ta'' in Pali, or ''sat + tva'' in Sanskrit). In Buddhism, there are six senses, the sixth being the subjective experience of the mind. Sentience is simply awareness prior to the arising of [[Skandha]]. Thus, an animal qualifies as a sentient being.

==Animal welfare, rights, and sentience==
{{main|Animal consciousness|Animal cognition|Animal welfare|Animal rights|Pain in animals}}
In the philosophies of animal welfare and rights, sentience implies the ability to experience [[pleasure]] and [[suffering|pain]]. Additionally, it has been argued, as in the documentary ''Earthlings'': {{quote|Granted, these animals do not have all the desires we humans have; granted, they do not comprehend everything we humans comprehend; nevertheless, we and they do have some of the same desires and do comprehend some of the same things. The desires for food and water, shelter and companionship, freedom of movement and avoidance of pain.&lt;ref&gt;Monson S (2005), "Earthlings".&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Animal-welfare advocates typically argue that any sentient being is entitled, at a minimum, to protection from unnecessary suffering, though animal-rights advocates may differ on what rights (e.g., the right to life) may be entailed by simple sentience. [[Sentiocentrism]] describes the theory that sentient individuals are the center of moral concern.

The 18th-century philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] compiled enlightenment beliefs in ''Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'', and he included his own reasoning in a comparison between slavery and [[sadistic personality disorder|sadism]] toward animals:

{{quotation|The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason why a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor [see Louis XIV's [[Code Noir]]]... What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason, or, perhaps, the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day, or a week, or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? the [''sic''] question is not, Can they ''reason?'' nor, Can they ''talk?'' but, Can they ''suffer?''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation (A New Edition, corrected by the Author)|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|author-link=Jeremy Bentham|date=1879|orig-year=This edition first published 1823|chapter=Chapter XVII. Of the Limits of the Penal Branch of Jurisprudence|at=p. 311 footnote|url=https://archive.org/stream/anintroductiont01bentgoog#page/n349/mode/1up|publisher=Clarendon Press|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 20th century, Princeton University professor [[Peter Singer]] argued that Bentham's conclusion is often dismissed by an appeal to a distinction that condemns human suffering but allows non-human suffering, typically "appeals" that are [[logical fallacies]] (unless the distinction is factual, in which case the appeal is just one logical fallacy, ''[[begging the question|petitio principii]]''). Because many of the suggested distinguishing features of humanity—extreme intelligence; highly complex language; etc.—are not present in marginal cases such as mute humans, young children, deaf humans, and mentally disabled humans, it appears that the only distinction is a prejudice based on species alone, which animal-rights supporters call [[speciesism]]—that is, differentiating humans from other animals purely on the grounds that they are human. His opponents accuse him of the same petitio principii.

[[Gary Francione]] also bases his [[abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionist]] theory of animal rights, which differs significantly from Singer's, on sentience. He asserts that, "All sentient beings, humans or nonhuman, have one right: the basic right not to be treated as the property of others."&lt;ref&gt;Francione, Gary. [http://www.abolitionistapproach.com/?page_id=52 Official blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Linzey]], founder of the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics in England, is known as a foremost international advocate for recognising animals as sentient beings in biblically based faith traditions. The Interfaith Association of [[Animal Chaplain]]s encourages animal ministry groups to adopt a policy of recognising and valuing sentient beings.

In 1997 the concept of [[Animal Sentience (journal)|animal sentience]] was written into the basic law of the European Union. The legally binding protocol annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam recognises that animals are "sentient beings", and requires the EU and its member states to "pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals".

The laws of several states include certain invertebrates such as cephalopods (octopuses, squids) and decapod crustaceans (lobsters, crabs) in the scope of animal protection laws, implying that these animals are also judged capable of [[Pain in invertebrates|experiencing pain]] and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ciwf.org.uk/animal_sentience/policy_and_culture/default.aspx Science, policy and cultural implications of animal sentience, Compassion in World Farming]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial intelligence==
The term "sentience" is not used by major [[artificial intelligence]] textbooks and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;See the four most popular AI textbooks (or [[Talk:Artificial intelligence/Textbook survey|Wikipedia's survey of their contents]]), none of which mention "sentience" at all:

==Science fiction==
{{See also|Artificial intelligence in fiction#Sentient AI|Personhood}}
{{Original research section|date=May 2015}}
In [[science fiction]], an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]], [[android (robot)|android]], [[robot]], [[hologram]], or [[computer]] described as "sentient" is usually treated as a fully human character, with similar rights, qualities, and capabilities as any other character; it is not human, but in this work of fiction it has genuine "[[personhood]]". "Sentience", in this context, is a hypothetical [[essentialism|essential]] human property that brings many other qualities associated with [[personhood]] with it, such as [[volition (psychology)|will]], [[desire]], [[intelligence]], [[autonomy]], [[humor]], [[aesthetic appreciation]] and so on. Science fiction uses the words "[[intelligence]]", "[[sapience]]", "[[self-awareness]]", and "[[consciousness]]" in similar ways.

This unique definition permits usage that would not make sense outside of science fiction. For example, Commander Data describing his cat as "not sentient" in one episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', whereas the term was originally used (by philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] and others) to emphasize the sentience of animals (certainly including cats).

Science fiction has explored several forms of consciousness beside that of the individual human mind, and how such forms might perceive and function. These include group sentience, where a single mind is composed of multiple non-sentient members (sometimes capable of reintegration, where members can be gained or lost, resulting in gradually shifting mentalities); hive sentience, which is the extreme form of insect hives, with a single sentience extended over huge numbers of non-sentient bodies; and transient sentience, where a lifeform is sentient of that transience.

==Sentience quotient==

The sentience quotient concept was introduced by [[Robert A. Freitas Jr.]] in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="Freitas"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Xenopsychology | author = Freitas, R.A., Jr. | journal=[[Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact]] |date=April 1984  | volume=104 | pages=41–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It defines sentience as the relationship between the information processing rate of each individual processing unit (neuron), the weight/size of a single unit, and the total number of processing units (expressed as mass). It was proposed as a measure for the sentience of all living beings and computers from a single neuron up to a hypothetical being at the theoretical computational limit of the entire universe. On a [[logarithmic scale]] it runs from −70 up to +50.

The '''settlement movement''' was a [[reformist]] social movement that began in the 1880s and peaked around the 1920s in England and the U.S. Its goal was to bring the rich and the poor of society together in both physical proximity and social interconnectedness. Its main object was the establishment of "settlement houses" in poor urban areas, in which volunteer middle-class "settlement workers" would live, hoping to share knowledge and culture with, and [[poverty reduction|alleviate the poverty]] of, their low-income neighbors. The "settlement houses" provided services such as daycare, education, and healthcare to improve the lives of the poor in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
===England===
The movement started in London in 1884 with the founding of [[Toynbee Hall]]. These houses, radically different from those in America, often offered food, shelter, and basic and [[higher education]], provided by virtue of charity on part of wealthy donors, the residents of the city, and (for education) scholars who volunteered their time.

[[Victorian era|Victorian]] England, increasingly concerned with poverty, gave rise to the movement whereby those connected to universities settled students in slum areas to live and work alongside local people. Through their efforts settlement houses were established for education, savings, sports, and arts. Such institutions were often praised by religious representatives concerned with the lives of the poor, and criticised as normative or moralistic by radical social movements.

There were basic commonalities in the movement.  These institutions were more concerned with societal causes for poverty, especially the changes that came with industrialisation, rather than personal causes which their predecessors believed were the main reason for poverty. The settlement movement believed that social reform was best pursued and pushed for by private charities.

[[File:Toynbee Hall 1902.jpg|thumb|Toynbee Hall settlement house, founded 1884, pictured here in 1902]]
The [[British Association of Settlements and Social Action Centres]] is a network of such organisations. During the [[Social Gospel|social Christian movement]], [[Samuel Barnett (reformer)|Samuel]] and [[Henrietta Barnett]] founded Toynbee Hall, [[Oxford House (settlement)|Oxford House]]&lt;ref name="Danilov pp. 356-357" /&gt; in 1884 in Bethnal Green. Other early examples include [[Browning Hall]], formed in [[Walworth]] in 1895 by [[Francis Herbert Stead]], and Mansfield House Settlement, also in east London (see [[Percy Alden]]). There is also a global network, the [[International Federation of Settlements]].

The movement gave rise to many social policy initiatives and innovative ways of working to improve the conditions of the most excluded members of society. The Poor Man's Lawyer service came about because a barrister volunteered his time and encouraged his friends to do the same. In general, the settlement movement, and settlement houses in particular, "have been a foundation for social work practice in this country".&lt;ref&gt;Reyes, J. M. (2008).

(UMI No. AAI3314871) Retrieved July 13, 2009, from Dissertations and Theses Database.&lt;/ref&gt;

As higher education opened up to women, young female graduates brought their energy to the settlement movement. The Women's University Settlement (now Blackfriars Settlement) was founded in 1887 "by women from [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton]] and [[Newnham College]]s at [[Cambridge University]], [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret]] and [[Somerville College]]s at [[Oxford University]] and [[Bedford College, London|Bedford]] and [[Royal Holloway]] Universities"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our History |url=http://www.blackfriars-settlement.org.uk/history |website=www.blackfriars-settlement.org.uk |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===United States===
[[File:Bohemmian Youth East St. Louis.jpg|thumb|Bohemian immigrant youth at the [[Lessie Bates Davis Neighborhood House]] in 1918 in East St. Louis, Illinois]]
Between 1890 and 1910, more than 12 million European people immigrated to the United States. They came from Ireland, Russia, Italy and other European countries and provided cheap factory labor, a demand that was created with the country's [[Manifest destiny|expansion into the west]] following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Many immigrants lived in crowded and disease-ridden tenements, worked long hours, and lived in poverty. Children often worked to help support the family. [[Jacob Riis]] wrote ''How the Other Half Lives'' about the lives of immigrants on New York City's Lower East Side to bring greater awareness of the immigrant's living conditions.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Friedman|author2=Brett Friedman|title=Settlement Houses: Improving the Social Welfare of America's Immigrants|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NTibovoz4EC|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Rosen Classroom|isbn=978-1-4042-0859-9|pages=4–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous settlement house in the United States is [[Chicago]]'s [[Hull House]], founded by [[Jane Addams]] and [[Ellen Gates Starr]] in 1889 after Addams visited Toynbee Hall within the previous two years. Hull House, though, was not a religious-based organization. It focused on providing education and recreational facilities for European immigrant women and children.&lt;ref name="Danilov pp. 356-357"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor J. Danilov|title=Famous Americans: A Directory of Museums, Historic Sites, and Memorials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kWsrAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA356|date=26 September 2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-9186-9|pages=356–357|chapter=Social Activists}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Katharine Coman]], [[Vida Dutton Scudder|Vida Scudder]], and [[Katharine Lee Bates]] were among a group of women who founded Denison House in Boston in 1892. [[Lenox Hill Neighborhood House]], founded in 1894, Friendly Inn Settlement House, founded in 1874, [[Henry Street Settlement]], founded in 1893, [[Hiram House]], founded in 1896, and [[University Settlement Society of New York|University Settlement House]], founded in 1886 and the oldest in the United States, were, like Hull House, important sites for social reform. United Neighborhood Houses of New York is the federation of 38 settlement houses in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhny.org&lt;/ref&gt; These and other settlement houses inspired the establishment of [[settlement school]]s to serve isolated rural communities in [[Appalachia]], such as the [[Hindman Settlement School]] in 1902 and the [[Pine Mountain Settlement School]] in 1913.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

By 1913, there were 413 settlements in 32 states.&lt;ref&gt;Husock, H. (1993). "Bringing back the settlement house". ''Public Welfare'', 51(4).&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, there were almost 500 settlement houses in the country.&lt;ref name="Danilov pp. 356-357" /&gt; The settlement house concept was continued by [[Dorothy Day]]'s [[Catholic Worker Movement|Catholic Worker]] "hospitality houses" in the 1930s.

American settlement houses functioned on a philosophy of “scientific philanthropy,” a belief that instead of giving direct relief, charities should give resources to the poor so they could break out of the circle of poverty.  American charity workers feared that the deeply entrenched [[social class]] system in Europe would develop in the United States.

===Russia===
[[File:Wiki_Zelenko_Kindergarten_Vadkovsky_Lane.jpg|thumb|Site of the Communal Club for Working Children, a cornerstone of the Russian Settlement network.]]
The movement also spread to late imperial Russia, as [[Stanislav Shatsky]] and [[Alexander Zelenko]] set up a network of educational and social institutions in northern [[Moscow]] in 1905, naming it "Setlement" ("{{lang|ru|Сетлемент}}", the English word transliterated to Russian). This network of institutions was closed down by the government in 1908, due to alleged [[Socialism|socialist]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Valkanova, Y. &amp; Brehony, K. J.

==Description==
Today, settlements are still community-focused organizations, providing a range of services including early education, youth guidance and crime intervention, senior programs, and specialized programs for young people who have "aged out" of the foster care system. Since they are staffed by professional employees and students, they no longer require that employees live alongside those they serve.

==Legacy and impact==
Settlement houses influenced [[urban design]] and [[architecture]] in the 20th century. 
For example, [[James Rossant]] of Conklin + Rossant agreed with [[Robert E. Simon]]'s social vision and consciously sought to mix economic backgrounds when drawing up the master plan for [[Reston, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;
  {{cite web

'''Social reality'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion|last = Berger|first = Peter|publisher = Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc.|year = 1967|isbn = |location = Garden City, NY|pages = 3-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; is distinct from biological [[reality]] or [[individual]] cognitive reality, representing as it does a phenomenological level created through [[social interaction]] and thereby transcending individual motives and actions.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The product of human dialogue, social reality may be considered as consisting of the accepted social [[wikt:tenet|tenet]]s of a [[community]], involving thereby relatively stable laws and [[social representation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ireke Bockting, ''Character and Personality in the Novels of William Faulkner'' (1995) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radical constructivism]] would cautiously describe social reality as the product of uniformities among observers (whether or not including the current observer themselves).&lt;ref&gt;[[Niklas Luhmann]], ''Theories of Distinction'' (2002) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schütz, Durkheim, and Spencer==

The problem of social reality has been treated exhaustively by philosophers in the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] tradition, particularly [[Alfred Schütz]], who used the term "social world" to designate this distinct level of reality. Within the social world, Schütz distinguished between social reality that could be experienced directly (''umwelt'') and a social reality beyond the immediate horizon, which could yet be experienced if sought out.&lt;ref&gt;George Walsh, "Introduction", Alfred Schütz, ''The Phenomenology of the Social World'' (1997)p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; In his wake, [[ethnomethodology]] explored further the unarticulated structure of our everyday competence and ability with social reality.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the subject had been addressed in [[sociology]] as well as other disciplines. For example, [[Émile Durkheim]] stressed the distinct nature of "the social kingdom. Here more than anywhere else the idea is the reality".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in T. van der Eyden, ''Public Management of Society'' (2003) p. 487&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Spencer]] had coined the term ''[[superorganism|super-organic]]'' to distinguish the social level of reality above the biological and psychological.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Spencer, ''The Principles of Sociology'', Vol. 1, Part 1. "The Data of Sociology"(1876)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Searle==

[[John Searle]] has used the theory of [[speech act]]s to explore the nature of social/institutional reality, so as to describe such aspects of social reality which he instances under the rubrics of "marriage, property, hiring, firing, war, revolutions, cocktail parties, governments, meetings, unions, parliaments, corporations, laws, restaurants, vacations, lawyers, professors, doctors, medieval knights, and taxes, for example".&lt;ref&gt;John R. Searle, ''The Construction of Social Reality'' (Penguin 1996) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle argued that such institutional realities interact with each other in what he called "systematic relationships (e.g., governments, marriages, corporations, universities, armies, churches)"&lt;ref&gt;Searle, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; to create a multi-layered social reality.

For Searle, language was the key to the formation of social reality because "language is precisely designed to be a self-identifying category of institutional facts"; i.e., a system of publicly and widely accepted symbols which "persist through time independently of the urges and inclinations of the participants."&lt;ref&gt;Searle, p. 73 and p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective/subjective==

There is a debate in [[social theory]] about whether social reality exists independently of people's involvement with it, or whether (as in [[social constructionism]]) it is only created by the human process of ongoing interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Giddens, ''Sociology'' (2006) p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Peter L. Berger]] argued for a new concern with the basic process of the social construction of reality.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Berger stated that the social construction of reality was a process made up of three steps: externalization, objectivation and internalization. In similar fashion, post-[[Sartre|Sartrians]] like [[R. D. Laing]] stress that, "once certain fundamental structures of experience are shared, they come to be experienced as objective entities...they take on the force and character of partial autonomous realities, with their own way of life".&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''[[The Politics of Experience]]'' (Penguin 1984) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Yet at the same time, Laing insisted that such a socially real grouping "can be nothing else than the multiplicity of the points of view and actions of its members...even where, through the interiorization of this multiplicity as synthesized by each, this synthesized multiplicity becomes ubiquitous in space and enduring in time".&lt;ref&gt;Laing, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of a social reality independent of individuals or the ecology would seem at odds with the views of [[perceptual psychology]], including those of [[J. J. Gibson]], and those of most [[ecological economics]] theories.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Scholars such as John Searle argue on the one hand that "a socially constructed reality presupposes a reality independent of all social constructions".&lt;ref&gt;Searle, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he accepts that social realities are humanly created, and that "the secret to understanding the continued existence of institutional facts is simply that the individuals directly involved and a sufficient number of members of the relevant communities must continue to recognize and accept the existence of such facts".&lt;ref&gt;Searle, p. 190 and p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socialisation and the Capital Other==

[[Freud]] saw a child's induction into social reality as consolidated with the passing of the [[Oedipus complex]] and the internalisation of the parents: "the same figures who continue to operate in the [[super-ego]] as the agency we know as conscience...also belong to the real external world. It is from there that they were drawn; their power, behind which lie hidden all the influences of the past and of tradition, was one of the most strongly-felt manifestations of reality".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 422&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] clarified the point by stressing that this was "a highly significant moment in the transfer of powers from the subject to the Other, what I call the Capital Other...the field of the Other – which, strictly speaking, is the Oedipus complex".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (Penguin 1994) p. 129 and p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan considered that "the Oedipus complex...superimposes the kingdom of culture on that of nature",&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (1997) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; bringing the child into [[The Symbolic|the Symbolic Order]].

Within that order, [[Lacanianism|Lacanians]] consider that "institutions, as ''signifying practices'', are much more extensive structures than romantic notions allow and they thus implicate us in ways which narrower definitions cannot recognize...exceed any intersubjective intention or effect".&lt;ref&gt;Joan Copjec, in Jacques Lacan, ''Television'' (London 1990) p. 51-2&lt;/ref&gt; In similar fashion, Searle asserts that "institutional power – massive, pervasive, and typically invisible – permeates every nook and cranny of our social lives...the invisible structure of social reality".&lt;ref&gt;Searle, p. 94 and p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring trust==

If one accepts the validity of the idea of social reality, scientifically, it must be amenable to measurement, something which has been explored particularly in relation to [[trust (social sciences)|trust]]. "Trust is...part of a community's [[social capital]], as [[Francis Fukuyama]] argues, and has deep historical and cultural roots".&lt;ref&gt;Will Hutton, ''The State to Come'' (London 1997) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories of the measurement of trust in the sociological community are usually called theories of social capital, to emphasize the connection to [[economics]], and the ability to measure outputs in the same manner.

==Propaganda==

One aspect of social reality is the principle of the "[[big lie]]", which states that an outrageous untruth is easier to convince people of than a less outrageous truth. Many examples from [[politics]] and [[theology]] (e.g., the claim that the [[Roman Emperor]] was in fact a "god") demonstrate that this principle was known by effective [[Propaganda|propagandists]] from early times, and continues to be applied to this day. The [[propaganda model]] of [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Edward S. Herman]] supports the "big lie" thesis with more specifics.

'''Stewart Clegg''' (born 1947, [[Bradford]]) is a British-born Australian [[sociology|sociologist]] and [[organizational theory|organizational theorist]] and Professor at [[University of Technology, Sydney]] (UTS), where he is also Research Director of CMOS (Centre for Management and Organisation Studies).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://datasearch.uts.edu.au/business/staff/details.cfm?StaffId=250 UTS: Professor Stewart Clegg, Business]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

Clegg is an Australian professor in the [[Organization Studies]] field and is the author and editor of over forty [[monographs]], textbooks, encyclopaedia, and handbooks&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Clegg, S.R. &amp; Haugaard, M. (eds) 2009, Sage handbook of power, Sage, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; including the ''Sage handbook of power'' (2009)&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; and ''Sage directions in organisation studies'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, S.R. (eds) 2009, and a Four-Volume Set, Sage directions in organization studies, Sage, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart's research interests include organisation and management theory and the theory of power,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; although he has written on other topics including 'food', 'strategy', 'modernity' and 'gossip'.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In 2003, a book listed Clegg as one of the top 200 business gurus in the world&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, T.H., Prusak, L. &amp; Wilson, H.J. 2003, What's the big idea? Creating and capitalizing on the best new management thinking, [[Harvard Business School]], Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; and this book has been translated into many languages, including Spanish, [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and French. He sits on Editorial Boards for research journals and is Editor of the AiOS (Advances in Organization Studies) for [[Benjamins]], the European and American publishers. Stewart has also acted as consultant to international newspapers, such as the ''[[British Sunday Times]]'' and the ''[[Australian Financial Review]]'', for whom he has devised the methodology for their "Power Lists", as well as to universities, business firms, and health services.&lt;ref name="saxton1"&gt;[http://www.saxton.com.au/default.asp?sd8=2580 Stewart Clegg – Saxton Speakers Bureau]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of power==

Clegg's "circuits of power"&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, S.R. 1989, Frameworks of power, Sage, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; theory likens the production and organising of power to an electric circuit board consisting of three distinct interacting circuits: episodic, dispositional, and facilitative. These circuits operate at three levels, two are macro and one is micro. The ''episodic circuit'' is the micro level and is constituted of irregular exercise of power as agents address feelings, communication, conflict, and resistance in day-to-day interrelations. The outcomes of the episodic circuit are both positive and negative. The ''dispositional circuit'' is constituted of macro level rules of practice and socially constructed meanings that inform member relations and legitimate authority. The ''facilitative circuit'' is constituted of macro level technology, environmental contingencies, job design, and networks, which empower or disempower and thus punish or reward, agency in the episodic circuit. All three independent circuits interact at “obligatory passage points” which are channels for empowerment or disempowerment.

To give a sense of how this model works, Clegg applies it to Crozier’s&lt;ref&gt;Crozier, M. 1964, The bureaucratic phenomenon, Tavistock, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; study of a tobacco factory in France where maintenance workers modified the plant equipment. This action empowered them with exclusive knowledge of the machinery unavailable in the manuals. It also represented taking control of an obligatory passage point, which altered all three circuits of power. The act directly altered the facilitative circuit of technology. The knock-on effect at the dispositional circuit was that it changed what it meant to be a maintenance worker. At the episodic circuit it altered the worker’s power in day-to-day interaction and control of resources and outcomes. The overall impact of taking control of an obligatory passage point was that it allowed the workers to negotiate increased freedoms and wage increases.

==Academic positions==

Before moving to UTS, Clegg was Reader at [[Griffith University]] (1976–84), Professor at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] (1985–89), Professor at the [[University of St. Andrews]] (1990–3), and Foundation Professor at the [[University of Western Sydney]], [[Macarthur, New South Wales|Macarthur]], (1993–96). He has also held positions at Universities in Scotland; Australia, England, France, [[New Zealand]], Hong Kong, [[Brazil]], Canada, [[Mexico]] and the United States.&lt;ref name="saxton1"/&gt; He currently also holds Visiting Professorships at European universities and research centres. In 2010 he spent time as a Visiting distinguished Fellow in the Institute of Advanced Study, [[Durham University]], and in 2011 will be the Montezelomo Distinguished Visiting Professor at the [[University of Cambridge]]'s [[Judge Institute]].

==Honorary Doctor of Philosophy==
Stewart is one of the 2017 honorary doctor recipients at [[Umeå University]]. The honorary doctorate was awarded for his scientific output which has far-reaching multidisciplinary content characterized by the ambition to place organization and management theory in a wider social science context all the while setting out from a critical and reflecting view. His research contribution on power mechanisms in organizations is indisputable. Stewart R. Clegg also held an active role as a member of the scientific reference group in the research project funded by the Swedish Riksbank Strategy, Design and Organizing in City Development Processes (Led by Nils Wåhlin at Umeå School of Business and Economics), that greatly dealt with the European Capital of Culture venture in Umeå. Stewart R. Clegg has visited Umeå School of Business and Economics on a number of occasions, the last visit was in February 2017 as an external reviewer for a public defense of a doctoral dissertation on organizational paradoxes (Paradox as the New Normal - Medhanie Gaim).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.umu.se/sok/english/news-and-press-releases/newsdetail/three-international-honorary-doctors-at-the-faculty-of-social-sciences.cid282743 | title=Tre internationella hedersdoktorer vid Samhällsvetenskapliga fakulteten}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent works==

Recently{{when|date=October 2011}} Clegg has been publishing on a broad front that includes contributions to sociology, [[organisation studies]] and strategy. The latest book on strategy is linked here: http://www.uk.sagepub.com/booksProdDesc.nav?prodId=Book234128&amp;#tabview=title. Amongst his most recent interests has been exploration of the theme of liquid modernity and what it means for contemporary organisation and organisations. Presently{{when|date=October 2011}} he is working on two four volume collections of classics in Power and Political Theory and Power and Organization Theory with Mark Haugaard.

==Biography==

Born in [[Bradford]], England, Clegg migrated to Australia in 1976, after completing his first degree in [[Behavioural Science]] (Sociology) at the [[University of Aston]] and a Doctorate in Management at [[Bradford University]]. Apart from a brief period at the [[University of St Andrews]] as Professor of Organization Studies and Head of the Department of Management from 1990–1993 he has been an Australian resident since that time.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

A '''wearable generator''' is an article of clothing that contains some form of electrical generation system built in. The concept encompasses a variety of generation systems intended to supply small amounts of power to keep portable electronics in a good state of charge through natural motions of the body.

==Summary==
There are many great projects related to wearable technology or wearable power generation. One concept, for example, is an article of clothing that has the ability to convert the movements of the wearer into [[electricity]] using [[nanotechnology|nano]]-[[ion]] pumps.&lt;ref name="sparksuit"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.seriouswheels.com/cars/top-Nike-ONE-Gran-Turismo.htm| title = Spark Suit information | publisher = Serious Wheels | accessdate = 2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on [[nanotechnology]] and has the ability to [[electrical generator|generate electricity]] for the purposes of building [[Muscle|muscle mass]] and improving [[motor coordination|coordination]].&lt;ref name="disenoart"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.diseno-art.com/encyclopedia/archive/nike_one.html| title = Spark Suit information (second reference) | publisher = Diseno-Art | accessdate = 2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emergency workers like firemen and paramedics could use chest-implanted sensors to create a floor plan of unfamiliar buildings; making a rookie perform his job as efficiently as a veteran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/25/mit-hacks-kinect-laser-for-a-wearable-map-generator-for-firefighters/| title = ''MIT Hacks Kinect Laser For A Wearable Map Generator For Firefighters'' | publisher = Tech Crunch | accessdate = 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; With cameras becoming cheaper and smaller, wearable generators may also serve as a quick method to recharge the batteries on those devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.intechopen.com/books/smart-actuation-and-sensing-systems-recent-advances-and-future-challenges/a-technology-for-soft-and-wearable-generators| title = ''A Technology for Soft and Wearable Generators'' | publisher = Intech | accessdate = 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The environmental burden of disposing used batteries has contributed to [[Electronic waste|e-waste]]; something that wearable generators may drastically reduce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gizmowatch.com/entry/wearable-generators-to-power-battery-life-in-your-equipment/| title = ''Wearable generators to power battery life in your equipment'' | publisher = Gizmo Watch | accessdate = 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enough energy can theoretically be harnessed from a person's body heat to power a [[smartphone]] or [[Tablet computer|tablet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.designnews.com/document.asp?doc_id=239901 | title = ''Wearable Fabric Could Power Your iPhone'' | publisher = Design News | accessdate = 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3973">A '''workcell''' is an arrangement of resources in a manufacturing environment to improve the quality, speed and cost of the process.  Workcells are designed to improve these by improving process flow and eliminating waste.  They are based on the principles of [[Lean Manufacturing]] as described in ''[[The Machine That Changed the World (book)|The Machine That Changed the World]]'' by Womack, Jones and Roos.&lt;ref name="MTCTW"&gt;''Machine That Changed the World'', James P. Womack, Daniel T. Jones, Daniel Roos, HarperBusiness, 1991, {{ISBN|978-0-06-097417-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Classical manufacturing management approaches dictate that costs be lowered by breaking the process into steps, and ensuring that each of these steps minimizes cost and maximizes efficiency. This discrete approach has resulted in machines placed apart from each other to maximize the efficiency and throughput of each machine. The traditional accounting for machine capitalization is based on the number of parts produced, and this approach reinforces the idea of lowering the cost of each machine (by having them produce as many parts as possible.) Increasing the number of parts (WIP) adds waste in areas such as Inventory and Transportation.

Large amounts of excess Inventory often now accumulate between the machines in the process for reasons to do with 'unbalanced' line capacities and batch processing. In addition, the parts must now be transported between the machines. An increase in the number of machines involved also will reduce each worker's multi-skilling proficiency (since that would need them to learn how to operate multiple machines, and they too will need to move between those machines.)

Lean focuses on optimizing the end-to-end process as a whole. This enables a focus in the process on creating a finished product at the lowest cost (instead of lowering the cost of each step.) A common approach to achieving this is known as the workcell. Machines involved in building a product are placed next to each other to minimize transportation of both parts and people (an L-shaped desk with upper shelves is a good office example, which enables many office equipment to be within the reach of a worker). This will minimize waste in both transportation and in the storage of excess inventory.

At first glance, lean workcells may appear to be similar to traditional workcells, but they are inherently different. For instance, lean workcells must be designed for minimal wasted motion, which refers to any unnecessary time and effort required to assemble a product. Excessive twists or turns, uncomfortable reaches or pickups, and unnecessary walking all contribute to wasted motion and may put error inducing [[Muri (Japanese term)|stress]] upon the operator. Workcells can often be reconfigured easily to allow the adaptation of the process to fit [[takt time]]. This flexibility allows the work content to be adapted as demand or product mix changes.

Another Lean approach is to aim to have flexible manufacturing through small production lot sizes since this [[Mura (Japanese term)|smooths]] production. Small lot sizes usually increases transportation waste, but this can be eliminated if machines are back-to-back in a workcell.

==Implementation==

The implementation of workcells can reduce costs by an order of magnitude (90%){{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}.

In [[software development]], the core of the workcell is the [[cross-functional team]]. This team differs from a more traditional waterfall team:

The '''World Conference on Women, 1985''' or the '''Third World Conference on Women''' took place between 15 and 26 July 1985 in [[Nairobi]], Kenya, as the end-decade assessment of progress and failure in implementing the goals established by the [[World Plan of Action]] from the [[World Conference on Women, 1975|1975 inaugural conference on women]] as modified by the [[World Programme of Action]] of the [[World Conference on Women, 1980|second conference]]. Of significance during the conference was the end result of the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 40/108|Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women]] being adopted by [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]], unlike the previous two conferences. The conference marked the first time that [[lesbian rights]] were introduced in a UN official meeting and the turning-point for [[violence against women]] to emerge from being a hidden topic into one which needed to be addressed. Recognizing that the goals of the [[International Women's Year|Decade for Women]] had not been met, the conference recommended and the General Assembly approved on-going evaluation of women's achievements and failures through the year 2000.

==History==

In 1975, the United Nations approved the celebration of [[International Women's Year]]. As part of the celebrations they held the First World Conference on Women in 1975 in [[Mexico City]]. At that meeting, it was proposed that the following decade be proclaimed UN Decade for Women and follow-up meetings to assess progress be held in 1980 and 1985. The General Assembly adopted a World Plan of Action with recommended targets for governments to integrate women's equality, development and participation in peace initiatives. The mid-point meeting was held in [[Copenhagen]],{{sfn|Earth Summit|2002}} adding sections to the revised Programme of Action devoted to ensuring women equal access to education, employment opportunities, and adequate health care.{{sfn|Women's World Conferences|2008}} Both of the previous conferences had struggled with the divide caused by [[Cold War]] politics and the needs of the developing world.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|pp=5–7}}{{sfn|West|1999|p=180}} The geopolitical backdrop entering into the third conference was still contentious with a [[Early 1980s recession|worldwide debt crisis]] soaring in [[Economic history of Africa#Independence and the Cold War|Africa]] and [[Latin American debt crisis|Latin America]], protectionist policies under [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] causing widespread uncertainty, [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–91)|stagnation of the USSR]], the [[Strategic Defense Initiative|arms race]] build up, and the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. The question would be whether the conference could remain focused on women's issues in the face of Soviet accusations that the United States imperialistic and war mongering tactics were undermining the goals of the Decade for Women and the US concerns that the [[Eastern Bloc]] attempts at politicization would derail any real improvement in the unique problems faced by women.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|pp=7–8}}

==Official conference==

The 1985 Conference held from 15 and 26 July in [[Nairobi]], Kenya was the final review of the decade{{sfn|Women's World Conferences|2008}} and was led by conference president [[Margaret Kenyatta (mayor)|Margaret Kenyatta]].{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=7}} [[Leticia Ramos-Shahani|Leticia Shahani]], widowed mother of three children and a [[Philippines|Philippine]] diplomat served as the Secretary-General and made the crucial suggestion that off-the-record discussion by delegates would decrease the polarity which had plagued the previous conferences and would allow a more open discussion and lead to compromise.{{sfn|Fraser|2013}} There were 157 countries represented with around 1,400 official delegates, including such prominent delegates as: [[Phoebe Asiyo]] of [[Kenya]]; [[Ylva Ericsson]] of [[Sweden]]; Saida Hassan of [[Djibouti]];{{sfn|''The Salina Journal''|1985|p=6}} {{ill|Elena Lagadinova|bg|Елена Лагадинова}} of [[Bulgaria]];{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=104}} [[Carolyn McAskie]] an official at the [[Canadian International Development Agency]];{{sfn|''Awareness Times''|2007}} [[Maureen O'Neill]] head of the Canadian delegation, who was the coordinator for the [[Minister of Status of Women]];{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=9}}{{sfn|''The Chilliwack Progress''|1986|p=12}} [[Maureen Reagan]], daughter of the US president;{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=9}} [[Yvette Roudy]], the French Minister of Women's Rights;{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=48}} [[Jean Spautz]] of [[Luxembourg]];{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=12}} [[Tom Vraalsen]] of [[Norway]]; among others.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=104}}

After opening remarks by [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]], [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]],{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=98}} Kenyan President [[Daniel arap Moi]] welcomed participants, expressing his hope that the conference would prove successful and that the objectives for women would not be obscured by distractions.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=100}} Opening remarks by Margaret Kenyatta on the history of the conference were followed by the general discussion.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=101}} The general session discussed that women ought to be able to live securely under conditions which granted them equality and justice, but there was a recognition that time is required to change traditional views and make people aware of needed change. It was noted that though legal equality had significantly improved, the disparity between the legal reality and practice was still broad. It was discussed that political tension and instability, as well as conflict added to curtailment of advancement, as did colonialism, racism, and economic stagnation.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|pp=109–111}} The conference noted gains in developed nations for parity of education, but significant gaps in girls education versus boys education in developing nations, which impacted future employment options as well.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=117}} Though some progress had been made on women's employment, it was noted that wage gaps, higher unemployment for women than men, and child care services all contributed to women's instability. As for health, it was acknowledged that as women were typically the health care providers for their families, that more effort must be made to ensure that women were healthy to allow them to continue to serve their families. Inadequate education and health facilities, combined with high birth rates and customs or laws that allowed women to control their own fertility were continuing issues.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|pp=117–118}}

Projects throughout the decade had drawn awareness to the need to advance women's opportunities and statistic gathering had improved to measure their progress or lack of advancement. Violence against women was a prevalent problem as was the insecurity of indigenous women, elderly women, migrant and refugee women and their children, and rural women. Water and food uncertainty needed to be addressed as women in many areas devoted the majority of their time into unpaid labors to maintain their families.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|pp=119–120}} Many UN programs had been expanded over the Decade for Women to incorporate women into their development programs, though it was noted that in general women's participation, and even employment in UN agencies though improved was still below targets. Programs directed at agriculture, economics, children, development, housing, health, technology and many others were examined and overall, improvement had been made in the inclusion of women's access. However, it was noted that making provisions for equality was not the same as attaining real equal opportunity.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|pp=121–125}} It was agreed that the cultural role in maintaining [[sexism]] and sex [[stereotypes]] was a complex issue which would involve dedicated effort to change school curricula and transform media messaging to enable women real access to socio-economic, cultural, legal and political parity.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|pp=126–127}} It was noted that for the first time, [[lesbian rights]] were introduced at an official UN conference by the Dutch delegate, [[Annelien Kappeyne van de Coppello]].{{sfn|Bunch|Hinojosa|2000|p=11}}{{sfn|Swiebel|2015|pp=1–2}}

The first committee, under the chair [[Cecilia López Montaño|Cecilia López]] of [[Colombia]], with vice-chairs, [[Begum Kulsum Saifullah Khan|Kulsum Saifullah]] of [[Pakistan]], [[Olimpia Solomonescu]] of [[Romania]], and [[Laetitia van den Assum]] of the [[Netherlands]], with Rapporteur [[Diaroumeye Gany]] of [[Niger]],{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=104}} discussed the first three chapters of the draft ''Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women''.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=129}} The second committee, under the chair [[Rosario Manalo]] of the [[Philippines]], with vice-chairs, Dame [[Billie Miller]] of [[Barbados]], [[Konjit SineGiorgis]] of [[Ethiopia]], and [[Eva Szilagyi]] of [[Hungary]], with Rapporteur [[Helen Ware (academic)|Helen Ware]] of Australia,{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=104}} discussed the remaining chapters of the Strategies.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=131}} Both committees recommended approving the draft and a discussion with the general session followed with a line by line review of the document.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=143}} Though both committees evaluated a number of draft resolutions, there was inadequate time for the general session to review the resolutions and no formal action was taken upon them.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=157}}

==Forum==

Dame [[Nita Barrow]] of [[Barbados]] chaired and organized the Forum,{{sfn|Fraser|2013}} with the assistance of [[Edith Ballantyne]], president of the United Nations' Conference of Non-governmental Organizations (CONGO).{{sfn|Foster|1989|pp=95-97}}{{sfn|Winslow|1995|p=145}} It was attended by more than 15,000 people, of which 60% were representatives from non-industrialized nations, and was held at the [[University of Nairobi]].{{sfn|Fraser|2013}}{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=217}} Unlike the facilities in Copenhagen, in Kenya, a kindergarten was set up for delegates' children.{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=56}} A Peace Tent was set up on the lawn of the university and hosted sessions about conflict and its impact of war on women.{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=217}} Among prominent attendees were: [[Charlotte Bunch]], a US lesbian activist ;{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=217}} [[Betty Friedan]], founder of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW);{{sfn|''The Telegraph''|2006}} [[Eddah Gachukia]] head of the Kenyan NGO committee;{{sfn|Sciolino|1985}} and others.

In addition to the basic themes of the official session, the Forum was asked to address issues concerning women who were poor, elderly, migrant or refugees, youth and address women in media. Round table discussions, workshops and two plenary sessions were established.{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=54}} The array of topics discussed in formal and impromptu meetings was vast, including such topics as childcare; consumer education; credit; family planning; [[female genital mutilation]]; the growth of women's studies; legal rights; literacy; [[Exploitation of women in mass media|media portrayals of women]]; motherhood and development programs for families; political prisoners; prostitution; systemic discrimination against women; violence; women and development; women and religion; women and technology; as well as lesbian workshops and many other topics in some 1200 workshops scheduled throughout the duration of the conference.{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=217}}{{sfn|Maters|1986|pp=55–56}}{{sfn|''The San Bernardino County Sun''|1985|p=7}} The lesbian workshops were the "first public discussion of lesbianism in Kenya"{{sfn|Bunch|Hinojosa|2000|p=10}} and resulted in a lesbian press conference in which it was acknowledged that lesbianism wasn't a [[Western world|Westernized]] concept, but instead effected women's rights throughout the globe.{{sfn|Bunch|Hinojosa|2000|p=11}} It also resulted in a proposal from one of the Dutch representatives for lesbian rights to be addressed in the official conference documents.{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=217}} In a workshop on development, [[Helen Safa]] brought forward the idea that "Gender and Development" (GAD) should replace the former strategy "Women in Development" (WID) used by the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] (CSW). This mirrored the NGO, [[Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era]] (DAWN)'s belief that WID simply tried to insert women into existing systems without reducing or changing their [[Patriarchy|paternal nature]]. They recommended that GAD, a strategic long-term planning method, become the new standard, which focused on designing systems specifically related to women and their growth.{{sfn|Bae|2004|p=9-12}}

In addition to the workshops, women were invited to participate in a number of cultural events like the Nairobi Film Forum which showed films and videos by and about women and gave workshops; exhibitions of art and photography; folklore workshops; concerts; martial arts classes; field trips to local villages.{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=55}} Because of the favorable climate conditions, women were able to gather in the open-air for a variety of both scheduled and unscheduled functions to build networks with other participants.{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=56}} The Forum after 1985 shifted in a way that reflected the divide between [[progressivism]] versus conservatism, as opposed to the polarized capitalist-socialist divide which had split prior conferences. It was recognized by the participants that global problems were women's issues, but that within their governmental systems, there was either a desire to promote or curtail change. A fundamental shift occurred which recognized that no matter the system, women were subordinate and that promoting a world view from women's perspectives allowed them to transcend their differences and focus on the commonalities they shared.{{sfn|Bae|2004|pp=20–22}} For example, aboriginal women recognized that where ever they were from, they battled for indigenous land rights; Arab and Israeli women discussed the need for peace; women lawyers whether from Islamic countries in South Asia or Catholic countries in Latin America recognized the struggle for women's rights under patriarchal religious systems.{{sfn|Sciolino|1985}}

==Outcomes==
[[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 40/108|Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women]] was adopted by consensus because of a strategy developed which allowed delegates to express reservations on the basis of individual paragraphs, rather than of the document as a whole. Because of stronger transnational relationships had been forged by the previous two conferences{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=8}} increased understanding by governments of the needs of their women constituents, a willingness of donors to help women integrate into development and increased effectiveness of NGOs in their activism, the list of topics covered in the Strategies was more extensive, including topics such as: agriculture, communications, constitutional and legal issues, education, employment, energy needs, environmental and water concerns, food security, health, housing, science and technology, social services, social and political equality as well as increased participation. The major themes development, equality, and peace were retained as were focuses on racism and refugees.{{sfn|Fraser|2013}} The document endorsed new strategies moving to the year 2000 and replaced the words [[Apartheid]] and [[Zionism]] with the more general term racism, to maintain the focus on women rather than polarizing issues.{{sfn|''The Ukiah Daily Journal''|1985|p=8}}{{sfn|''The Salina Journal''|1985|p=6}}

Out of the conference forum, several women's groups emerged that would become influential: [[Asian-Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development]] (APWLD), [[Comité de América Latina y El Caribe para la Defensa de los Derechos de la Mujer]] (CLADEM), [[Women in Law and Development in Africa]] (WILDAF),{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=217}} and the [[Tanzania Media Women's Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tripp|first=Aili Mari|date=January 2003|title=Women in Movement Transformations in African Political Landscapes|url=https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy2.cl.msu.edu/doi/pdf/10.1080/1461674032000080585?needAccess=true|journal=International Feminist Journal of Politics|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=233–255|doi=10.1080/1461674032000080585|issn=1461-6742|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were indicative of the types of exponential growth in NGOs dealing with women and their issues which were founded after the conference ended. Many of the organizations were information-sharing groups which pooled their resources and strategies to create innovative solutions.{{sfn|Chen|1995|p=479}} These networks, shifted the flow of activism and scholarship from the global North toward the Southern hemispheres and from top-down social structures to those which forge coalitions across cultural, racial and social boundaries.{{sfn|Chen|1995|p=480}} The conference also marked a turning point in the silence regarding [[violence against women]], which would ultimately lead to the passage of the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] in 1993.{{sfn|Pietilä|1999|p=17}} Since the objectives of the Decade for Women had not achieved the goals set out in 1975, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] made a decision after Nairobi to conduct world surveys on women every five years in a continuing effort to follow-up on the implementation of the Strategies for women.{{sfn|Pietilä|1999|pp=23–24}} One of the most important outcomes was moving women out of obscurity and establishing specific mechanisms for measuring women's progress.{{sfn|Zinsser|1990|p=22}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1672">In industrial [[statistics]], the '''X-bar chart ''' is a type of [[Walter A. Shewhart|Shewhart]] [[control chart]] that is used to monitor the [[arithmetic mean]]s of successive samples of constant size, n. This type of control chart is used for characteristics that can be measured on a continuous scale, such as weight, temperature, thickness etc. For example, one might take a sample of 5 shafts from production every hour, measure the diameter of each, and then plot, for each sample, the average of the five diameter values on the chart.

For the purposes of [[control limits|control limit]] calculation, the sample means are assumed to be [[Normal distribution|normally distributed]], an assumption justified by the [[Central Limit Theorem]].

The X-bar chart is always used in conjunction with a variation chart such as the [[Xbar and R chart|&lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; and R chart]] or [[Xbar and s chart|&lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; and s chart]]. The R-chart shows sample ranges (difference between the largest and the smallest values in the sample), while the s-chart shows the samples' [[standard deviation]]. The R-chart was preferred in times when calculations were performed manually, as the range is far easier to calculate than the standard deviation; with the advent of computers, ease of calculation ceased to be an issue, and the s-chart is preferred these days, as it is statistically more meaningful and efficient. Depending on the type of variation chart used, the average sample range or the average sample [[standard deviation]] is used to derive the X-bar chart's control limits.

'''Xulvi-Brunet and Sokolov’s algorithm''' generates [[Network science|networks]] with chosen degree correlations. This method is based on link rewiring, in which the desired degree is governed by parameter ρ. By varying this single parameter it is possible to generate networks from random (when ρ = 0) to perfectly [[Assortativity|assortative]] or disassortative (when ρ = 1).  This algorithm allows to keep network’s [[degree distribution]] unchanged when changing the value of ρ.&lt;ref name="xavi"&gt;Xulvi-Brunet and Sokolov (2005). "Changing correlations in networks: assortativity and dissortativity". Acta Phys. Pol. B 36: 1431-1455. 
http://www.actaphys.uj.edu.pl/fulltext?series=Reg&amp;vol=36&amp;page=1431&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assortative model==
In assortative networks, well-connected nodes are likely to be connected to other highly connected nodes. Social networks are examples of assortative networks. This means that an assortative network has the property that almost all nodes with the same degree are linked only between themselves.&lt;ref name="LSDS"&gt;Pop.(2011). "Resource Management based on Gossip Monitoring Algorithm for LSDS". Scalable Computing: Practice and Experience Volume 12, Number 1, pp. 21–34.  http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=7A0C831420583D5E245EC75FFC6E8426?doi=10.1.1.370.875&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Xulvi-Brunet - Sokolov algorithm for this type of networks is the following. 
In a given network, two links connecting four different nodes are chosen randomly. These nodes are ordered by their degrees. Then, with probability ρ, the links are randomly rewired in such a way that one link connects the two nodes with the smaller degrees and the other connects the two nodes with the larger degrees. If one or both of these links already existed in the network, the step is discarded and is repeated again. Thus, there will be no self-connected nodes or multiple links connecting the same two nodes. Different degrees of assortativity of a network can be achieved by changing the parameter ρ. 
Assortative networks are characterized by highly connected groups of nodes with similar degree. As assortativity grows,the average path length and [[clustering coefficient]] increase.&lt;ref name="xavi"/&gt;

==Disassortative model==
In disassortative networks, highly connected nodes tend to connect to less-well-connected nodes with larger probability than in uncorrelated networks.  Examples of such networks include biological networks.&lt;ref name="LSDS"/&gt;
 
The Xulvi-Brunet and Sokolov’s algorithm for this type of networks is similar to the one for assortative networks with one minor change. As before, two links of four nodes are randomly chose and the nodes are ordered with respect to their degrees. However, in this case, the links are rewired (with probability p) such that one link connects the highest connected node with the node with the lowest degree and the other link connects the two remaining nodes randomly with probability 1 – ρ. Similarly, if the new links already existed, the previous step is repeated. This algorithm does not change the degree of nodes and thus the degree distribution of the network.&lt;ref name="xavi"/&gt;
