'''Abram Games'''  {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Royal Designers for Industry|RDI]]}} (29 July 1914 in [[Whitechapel]], London – 27 August 1996 in London) was a British [[graphic designer]]. The style of his work – refined but vigorous compared to the work of contemporaries – has earned him a place in the pantheon of the best of 20th-century graphic designers. In acknowledging his power as a propagandist, he claimed, "I wind the spring and the public, in looking at the poster, will have that spring released in its mind." Because of the length of his career – over six decades – his work is essentially a record of the era's social history. Some of Britain's most iconic images include those by Games. An example is the "Join the ATS" poster of 1941, nicknamed the "blonde bombshell" recruitment poster. His work is recognised for its "striking colour, bold graphic ideas, and beautifully integrated typography".&lt;ref name="Souter, Nick and Tessa 2012 203"&gt;{{cite book|last=Souter, Nick and Tessa|title=The Illustration Handbook: A Guide to the World's Greatest Illustrators|year=2012|publisher=Oceana|isbn=978-1-84573-473-2|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life and career==
Born '''Abraham Gamse''' in Whitechapel, London on 29 July, the day after [[World War I]] began in 1914, he was the son of Joseph Gamse, a [[Latvians|Latvian]] photographer, and Sarah, ''nee'' Rosenberg, a [[seamstress]] born on the border of Russia and Poland. His father, who had emigrated to Britain in 1904, anglicised the family name to Games when Abram was 12.&lt;ref name="design"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.designmuseum.org/design/abram-games | title=Abram Games | publisher=[[Design Museum]] | date=2003 | accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games left [[Hackney Downs School]] at the age of 16 and, in 1930, went to [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] in London. Disillusioned by the teaching at Saint Martin's and worried about the expense of studying there, Games left after two terms.&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Slocombe|publisher=Imperial War Museum|year=2014|title=British Posters of the Second World War |ISBN=978-1-904897-92-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Games was determined to establish himself as a poster artist so while working as a "studio boy" for the commercial design firm [[Askew-Young]] in London between 1932 and 1936, he attended night classes in life drawing. He was fired from this position due to his jumping over four chairs as a prank.&lt;ref name=design/&gt; In 1934, his entry was second in the [[Health Council Competition]] and, in 1935, won a poster competition for the [[London County Council]].&lt;ref name=UOBag&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/collections/design-archives/resources/rdis-at-britain-can-make-it,-1946/abram-games |title=Abram Games|date= |accessdate=7 November 2016|work=University of Brighton Design Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1936 to 1940, he worked on his own as a freelance poster artist. An article on him in the influential journal ''Art and Industry'' in 1937 led to several high-profile commissions for Games, from the [[General Post Office]], [[London Transport (brand)|London Transport]], [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and others.&lt;ref name="Indie"/&gt;

==World War Two==
[[File:Join the Ats Art.IWMPST2832.jpg|thumb|''Join the ATS'' (1941) Art.IWMPST2832]]
At the start of World War Two, Games was conscripted into the British Army. He served until 1941 when he was approached by the Public Relations Department of the [[War Office]] who were looking for a graphic designer to produce a recruitment poster for the Royal Armoured Corps. From 1942 Games's service as the [[Official War Artist]] for posters resulted in 100 or so posters.&lt;ref name="Pulp"&gt;{{cite news|author=Smith, David|date=30 September 2007|title=Poster Churchill pulped on show|work=[[The Observer]]|accessdate=27 August 2013|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/sep/30/uk.past}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games was allowed a great deal of artistic freedom which enabled him to produce many striking images, often with surrealist elements. Among his first designs was the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] recruitment poster that became known as the ''blonde bombshell''. Games had wanted to challenge the rather drab image of the ATS but the authorities feared that the glamorous image he had produced would encourage young women to join the ATS for the "wrong reasons" and the poster was quickly withdrawn.&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foss"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brain Foss|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|title=War paint: Art, War, State and Identity in Britain, 1939-1945 |ISBN=978-0-300-10890-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design Games replaced it with was criticised by [[Winston Churchill]] as being too "Soviet".

Other notable posters included ''Your Talk May Kill Your Comrades'' (1942) in which a spiral symbolising gossip originates from a soldiers mouth to become a bayonet attacking three of his comrades. Games used the photographic techniques he had learnt from his father in that and other posters such as ''He Talked...They Died'' (1943) part of the ''Careless Talk'' campaign.&lt;ref name="Indie"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-abraham-games-1311967.html |title=Obituary:Abraham Games|author=Alan &amp; Isabella Livingston|date=28 August 1996|work=The Independent|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his poster work, Games completed a number of commissions for the [[War Artists' Advisory Committee]].&lt;ref name="Foss"/&gt; 

Later in the War, Churchill ordered a poster Games had produced to be taken off the wall of the ''Poster Design in Wartime Britain'' exhibition at Harrods in 1943. The [[Army Bureau of Current Affairs]], ABCA, had commissioned Games and [[Frank Newbould]] to produce posters for a series entitled ''Your Britain - Fight for It Now''. While Newbould produced rural images similar to the pre-war travel posters he had created for several railway companies, Games presented a set of three Modernist buildings that had been built to address poverty, disease and deprivation. The poster that annoyed Churchill most featured the [[Berthold Lubetkin]] designed [[Finsbury Health Centre]] superseding a ruined building with a child suffering from rickets. Churchill considered this nothing short of a libel on the conditions in British cities and ordered the poster to be removed.&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pulp"/&gt; [[Ernest Bevin]], the war-time [[Secretary of State for Employment|Minister of Labour]], had another poster in the series removed from the ''Poster Design in Wartime Britain'' exhibition organised by the Association of International Artists.&lt;ref name="ODNBag"&gt;{{cite book|author= HCG Matthew &amp; Brian Harrison (Editors)|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Vol 21 (Freudy-Gibberd)|ISBN=0-19-861371-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
[[File:Festival of Britain.JPG|thumb|The [[Festival of Britain]] emblem – the [[Festival Star]] – designed by Abram Games, from the cover of the South Bank Exhibition Guide, 1951]]
In 1946, Games resumed his freelance practice and worked for clients such Royal Dutch Shell, the ''[[Financial Times]]'', [[Guinness]], [[British Airways]], London Transport and [[El Al]].&lt;ref name=UOBag/&gt; He designed stamps for Britain, Ireland, Israel, Jersey and Portugal.&lt;ref name="Souter, Nick and Tessa 2012 203"/&gt; Also, he designed the logo for the [[JFS (school)|JFS]] school. There were also book jackets for [[Penguin Books]] and logos for the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]] (winning the 1948 competition) and for the 1965 [[Queen's Award to Industry]]. Among his pioneering contributions was, in 1954, the first moving on-screen symbol of BBC Television. He also produced murals. Between 1946 and 1953, Games was a visiting lecturer in graphic design at London's [[Royal College of Art]] and in 1958, was awarded the [[OBE]] for services to graphic design. In 1959, he was appointed a [[Royal Designer for Industry]] (RDI).&lt;ref name="Souter, Nick and Tessa 2012 203"/&gt; He also designed the tile motif of a swan on the [[Victoria line]] platforms at [[Stockwell tube station]] in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://golondon.about.com/od/Victoria-Line-Tile-Motifs/ss/Stockwell.htm|title=Stockwell - Victoria Line Tile Motifs|publisher=Go London|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Games had been among the first in Britain to see evidence of the atrocities committed at the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], when photographs taken there by British troops arrived at the War Office in 1945. The same year he produced a poster, ''Give Clothing for Liberated Jewry'', and would often work to support Jewish and Israeli organisations.&lt;ref name="ODNBag"/&gt; Games, who was Jewish, spent some time in Israel in the 1950s where, among other activities, he designed stamps for the Israeli Post Office, including for the [[Conquest of the Desert (exhibition)|1953 Conquest of the Desert]] exhibition&lt;ref name="stamp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boeliem.com/content/1953/93.html|title=Exhibition 'Conquest Of The Desert'|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and taught a course in postage-stamp design. He also designed covers for ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' and prayer book prints for the [[Reform Synagogues of Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt; In 1960 Games designed the poster known as ''Freedom from Hunger'' for the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite news |author=Moore, Rowan |url= https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/aug/23/abram-games-poster-graphic-design-principles |title=Abram Games, the poster boy with principles |date=23 August 2014|accessdate=24 August 2014|work=[[The Observer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Games was also an industrial designer of sorts. Activities in this discipline included the design of the 1947 Cona [[vacuum coffee maker]] (produced from 1949, reworked in 1959 and still in production) and inventions such as a circular vacuum cleaner and an early 1960s portable handheld [[duplicating machine]] by [[Gestetner]], which was not put into production due to the demise of mimeography.

In arriving at a poster design, Games would render up to 30 small preliminary sketches and then combine two or three into the final one. In the developmental process, he would work small because, he asserted, if poster designs "don't work an inch high, they will never work." He would also call on a large number of photographic images as source material.  Purportedly, if a client rejected a proposed design (which seldom occurred), Games would resign and suggest that the client commission someone else.

In 2013, the [[National Army Museum]], London, acquired a collection of his posters, each signed by Games and in mint condition.&lt;ref name="NAM"&gt;{{cite news|author= Kennedy, Maeve|date=23 August 2013|title=Poster girl of ATS joins National Army Museum|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=23 August 2013|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/aug/23/poster-girl-ats-national-army-museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aga Khan Museum''' ({{lang-fr|Musée Aga Khan}}) is a museum of [[Islamic art]], [[Iranian art|Iranian (Persian) art]] and [[Muslim culture]] in the [[North York]] district of [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Aga Khan Museum To Showcase Cultural Contributions of Muslim Civilisations |url=http://www.artlyst.com/articles/new-aga-khan-museum-to-showcase-cultural-contributions-of-muslim-civilisations |website=Artlyst |accessdate=August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is an initiative of the [[Aga Khan Trust for Culture]], an agency of the [[Aga Khan Development Network]]. It houses collections of Islamic art and heritage, including artifacts from the private collections of [[Aga Khan IV|His Highness the Aga Khan]], the [[Institute of Ismaili Studies]] in London, and Prince and Princess [[Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan|Sadruddin Aga Khan]], which showcase the artistic, intellectual and scientific contributions of Muslim civilizations.

==History==
[[File:Toronto, Canada (20311020513).jpg|thumb|left|The building of the museum was designed by [[Fumihiko Maki]].]]
In 1996, the Aga Khan bought the property 77 Wynford Drive from Shell Corporation. In 2002, he bought the adjacent property, which was formerly the [[Bata Shoes Head Office]]. On October 8, 2002, the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) announced the establishment of the Aga Khan Museum, [[Ismaili Centre, Toronto|Ismaili Centre]] and Park on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.akdn.org/press_release/551/Aga-Khan-to-Establish-Major-Academic-and-Cultural-Center-and-Museum-in-Canada |title=Aga Khan to Establish Major Academic and Cultural Center and Museum in Canada |publisher=[[Aga Khan Development Network]] |date=October 8, 2002 |accessdate=April 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207033210/http://www.akdn.org/press_release/551/Aga-Khan-to-Establish-Major-Academic-and-Cultural-Center-and-Museum-in-Canada |archivedate=December 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although heritage groups wanted it preserved, the modernist Bata Shoes building was demolished in 2007 to make way for the project. The foundation-laying ceremony for the project was performed by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] and the Aga Khan on May 28, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.theismaili.org/cms/1012/Mawlana-Hazar-Imam-in-Toronto-for-Foundation-Ceremony | title=Mawlana Hazar Imam is awarded Honorary Canadian Citizenship as he is joined by Prime Minister for Foundation Ceremony in Toronto | date=May 28, 2010 |publisher=TheIsmaili.org |accessdate=May 30, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100601082541/http://www.theismaili.org/cms/1012/Mawlana-Hazar-Imam-in-Toronto-for-Foundation-Ceremony| archivedate= June 1, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum was designed by [[Pritzker Prize]] winner [[Fumihiko Maki]]. The 10,000 square-metre structure is set within formal gardens and surrounded by a large park ([[Aga Khan Park]]) designed by landscape architect [[Vladimir Djurovic]].&lt;ref name="SpiritLife2007"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Spirit &amp; Life: Masterpieces of Islamic Art from the Aga Khan Museum Collection | publisher = The Aga Khan Trust for Culture | year = 2007 | location = Switzerland | isbn = 978-2-940212-02-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive site is shared with a new Ismaili Centre designed by the [[India]]n architect [[Charles Correa]].&lt;ref name="ArchRecord"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/081006AghaKhan.asp |title=Correa, Maki Tapped to Design Aga Khan Center |date=October 6, 2008 |publisher=Architectural Record, The McGraw-Hill Companies |accessdate=October 9, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081007213131/http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/081006AghaKhan.asp| archivedate= October 7, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maki, Djurovic and Correa worked in collaboration with the Toronto-based architectural firm Moriyama and Teshima, who worked as the architect of record on the project.&lt;ref&gt;Rochon, Lisa. "Maki's Aga Khan Museum Makes its Debut". Architectural Record. October 2014, pp. 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum opened on September 18, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Rochon, Lisa: [http://archrecord.construction.com/news/2014/09/140919-Makis-Aga-Khan-Museum-Makes-Its-Debut.asp "Maki's Aga Khan Museum Makes Its Debut"], in ''The Architectural Record'', September 19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==
[[File:Interior view - Aga Khan Museum - Toronto, Canada - DSC06599.jpg|thumb|Works from the museum's collection are displayed in exhibits throughout the museum.]]
The museum is dedicated to the acquisition, preservation, display and interpretation of artefacts relating to the intellectual, cultural, artistic and religious traditions of [[Muslim]] communities, past and present. Artefacts include [[Ceramic art|ceramics]], [[metalwork]], and paintings covering all periods of [[Islamic history]]. [[Manuscripts]] in the collection include the earliest known copy of [[Avicenna]]'s [[The Canon of Medicine|Qanun fi'l-Tibb]] ("The Canon of Medicine") dated 1052.&lt;ref name="SpiritLife2007"/&gt; A music programme is planned, which will work to expand knowledge of the traditional music of [[Asia]] and the [[Islamic world]], as well as their contemporary expression.

The museum will become a repository of historical materials related to the [[Ismaili]] community and house research programmes related to each one of the aspects of its institutional mission. It will also provide a space for permanent exchanges between the Islamic and the [[Western world]]s on educational, cultural and socio-economic issues.

The collection, which comprises some 1,000 objects,&lt;ref name="TIO20100520"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theismaili.org/cms/999/Aga-Khan-Museum-Collection-reflects-pluralism-of-the-Muslim-world-and-shared-human-heritage |title=Aga Khan Museum Collection reflects pluralism of the Muslim world and shared human heritage |author=Mehnaz Thawer |date=May 20, 2010 |publisher=TheIsmaili.org |accessdate=May 24, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100524024154/http://www.theismaili.org/cms/999/Aga-Khan-Museum-Collection-reflects-pluralism-of-the-Muslim-world-and-shared-human-heritage| archivedate= May 24, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes several superb examples of [[Qur'an]] manuscripts that demonstrate the variety of script, media and decorative styles that evolved in the Muslim world. Among them, an eighth century [[North Africa]]n folio demonstrates the earliest style of [[Kufic script]] written on [[parchment]]. A page from the well known ''[[Blue Qur'an]]'' provides an example of gold kufic script on indigo-dyed parchment. The Blue Qur'an is considered one of the most extraordinary Qur'an manuscripts ever created; its origins are 9th-tenth century North African, and it was likely created for the [[Fatimid]] caliphs ruling from [[Qayrawan]].&lt;ref name="SpiritLife2007"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26171">The '''debate between Bill Nye and Ken Ham''' on the question "Is Creation A Viable Model of Origins?" was held February 4, 2014, at the [[Creation Museum]] in [[Petersburg, Boone County, Kentucky|Petersburg, Kentucky]].

[[Ken Ham|Ham]], founder and chief executive officer of the [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationist]] (YEC) ministry [[Answers in Genesis]] (AiG), challenged [[Bill Nye|Nye]], a science educator best known for hosting the 1990s television series ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'', to the debate after taking exception to a [[YouTube]] video featuring Nye lamenting the refusal of a large segment of the U.S. population to accept [[evolution]]. Tickets to the event sold out within minutes, and according to a Christian public relations firm an estimated 3 million people viewed the event live via [[Streaming media|video streams]] on the Internet. During the debate, Ham advocated the legitimacy of a YEC model of the universe's origins, while Nye cited observations from a variety of scientific fields to defend the [[scientific consensus]] that the Earth is [[Age of the Earth|approximately 4.5 billion years old]].

Many scientists were critical of Nye for accepting Ham's invitation, claiming his participation in the debate gave Ham's views undeserved legitimacy, but two [[humanism|humanist]] groups &amp;ndash; the [[American Humanist Association]] and the [[Center for Inquiry]] &amp;ndash; praised Nye's decision. Scientists, both Christian and non-Christian, generally agreed that Nye won the debate, at least in terms of the science presented, although they debated how convincing the victory was.&lt;ref name=Biologos&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biologos.org/blog/ham-on-nye-our-take|title=Ham on Nye: Our Take|date=February 5, 2014|publisher=[[Biologos Foundation|The Biologos Foundation]]|accessdate=May 3, 2014|quote=Emily Ruppel, Deborah Haarsma, Jim Stump, John Walton, Dennis Venema, and Ted Davis.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ham later announced that the publicity generated by the debate had spurred fundraising for AiG's planned [[Ark Encounter]] theme park, allowing the ministry to begin construction.  Both Ham and Nye have since released books on the debate.&lt;ref name="NYT-20141103-JD"&gt;{{cite news |last=Deiviscio |first=Jeffrey |title=A Fight for the Young Creationist Mind - In 'Undeniable,' Bill Nye Speaks Evolution Directly to Creationists |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/science/in-undeniable-bill-nye-speaks-evolution-directly-to-creationists.html |date=November 3, 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=November 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://answersingenesis.org/store/product/inside-nye-ham-debate/|title=Inside the Nye Ham Debate|website=Answers in Genesis|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Bill Nye speaking at Jesse Hall.jpg|thumb|Bill Nye]]
On August 23, 2012, the [[Internet forum]] [[Big Think]] posted a video entitled "Creationism is Not Appropriate for Children" on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name=nyeyoutube&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Bill Nye|Nye, Bill]] |year=2012 |title=Creationism is Not Appropriate for Children |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHbYJfwFgOU |accessdate=February 11, 2014 |publisher=[[Big Think]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video featured [[Bill Nye]], best known for hosting the children's educational television program ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'' during the 1990s, lamenting that a significant portion of the U.S. population does not believe in [[evolution]], asserting that this disbelief has a detrimental impact on science education in the U.S., and encouraging parents who have doubts about evolution not to teach them to their children "because we need them."&lt;ref name=lovan2012&gt;{{cite news |last=Lovan |first=Dylan |title=Bill Nye warns: Creation views threaten US science |agency=AP Online |date=September 24, 2012 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-07009c71ef51419a98865a691635f294.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a follow-up interview with the [[Associated Press]], Nye said, "If we raise a generation of students who don't believe in the process of science, who think everything that we've come to know about nature and the universe can be dismissed by a few sentences translated into English from some ancient text, you're not going to continue to innovate."&lt;ref name=lovan2012 /&gt; By September 2012, the Associated Press reported that Nye's video had been viewed 4.6 million times and garnered 186,000 comments.&lt;ref name=lovan2012 /&gt;

[[File:Ken Ham.jpg|thumb|upright|Ken Ham]]
Days after the Nye video was posted, the YEC ministry [[Answers in Genesis]] (AiG) posted a video response featuring AiG scientists [[David Menton]] and [[Georgia Purdom]].&lt;ref name=hamresponse&gt;{{cite web |last=Ham |first=Ken |authorlink=Ken Ham |title=Time is Nye for a Rebuttal |work=Answers with Ken Ham |publisher=Answers in Genesis |date=August 29, 2012 |url=http://blogs.answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2012/08/29/time-is-nye-for-a-rebuttal/ |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; AiG founder and executive director [[Ken Ham]] also objected to the claims in Nye's video in a post on his blog, ''Answers with Ken Ham''.&lt;ref name=hamresponse /&gt; Soon after, Ham began trying to convince Nye to visit AiG's [[Creation Museum]] in [[Petersburg, Boone County, Kentucky|Petersburg, Kentucky]], which presents a YEC viewpoint that the Earth was created by the God of the Bible approximately 6,000 years ago and dinosaurs and humans once co-existed, based on a literal reading of the book of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], in contrast to the [[scientific consensus]] that the Earth is [[Age of the Earth|approximately 4.5 billion years old]] and the existence of dinosaurs and humans is separated by about 60 million years.&lt;ref name=debateset&gt;{{cite news |last=Lovan |first=Dylan |title=Bill Nye to visit Creation Museum for debate |agency=AP Online |date=January 2, 2014 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-55831a179e1849e6a16b5ebdf53d4afd.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 2, 2014, Ham announced on his [[Facebook]] page that Nye had accepted his invitation to a debate at the museum.&lt;ref name=debateset /&gt; AiG agreed to pay Nye's travel expenses, and the date &amp;ndash; February 4, 2014 &amp;ndash; was close to one of Nye's previously-scheduled speaking engagements at Kentucky's [[Murray State University]].&lt;ref name=debateset /&gt;&lt;ref name= nyetodebate&gt;{{cite news |last=Poulisse |first=Adam |title=Bill Nye to Debate Evolution with Creationist in Kentucky |newspaper=[[Pasadena Star-News]] |date=January 3, 2014 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-35539086.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an AiG press release, Ham commented that "having the opportunity to hold a cordial but spirited debate with such a well-known personality who is admired by so many young people will help bring the creation-evolution issue to the attention of many more people, including youngsters."&lt;ref name=debateset /&gt; Of Ham and AiG, Nye said, "This guy and his beliefs are in their midst, and we can't have this way of thinking for our science students, to have people like this organization try to insinuate themselves in our schools is not appropriate and a formula for a darker future."&lt;ref name=nyetodebate /&gt; Nye told the Associated Press that he didn't mind holding the debate at the Creation Museum: "It either makes me anxious, or it's an opportunity to influence that many more people and, frankly, have that much more fun."&lt;ref name=nyetodebate /&gt;

Many in the scientific community were critical of Nye's decision to participate in the event, claiming it lent undue credibility to the [[creationist]] worldview.&lt;ref name=csm&gt;{{cite news |last=Chowdhury |first=Sudeshna |title=Bill Nye vs. Ken Ham: Should Scientists Bother Debating Creationists? |magazine=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |date=February 3, 2014 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-357509370.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biologos Foundation|The Biologos Foundation]], an organization promoting the compatibility of [[Relationship between religion and science|science and religion]], released a statement advocating [[evolutionary creation]], maintaining the position "that you don't have to choose. You don't have to give up Christian faith in order to accept the best, most compelling science. We expect that we'll agree with most of what Bill Nye will say about the science of evolution. Fossils, genetics, and other disciplines give compelling evidence that all life on earth is related and developed over a very long time through natural processes. But we're also brothers and sisters in Christ with Ken Ham. We believe that Jesus is the Son of God, that he died for our sins and rose from the dead, and that the Bible is the authoritative word of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biologos.org/blog/ken-ham-vs-bill-nye|title=Ken Ham vs. Bill Nye|last=Haarsma|first=Deborah|date=January 15, 2014|publisher=[[The BioLogos Foundation]]|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others expressed concern that Nye's relative lack of familiarity with evolution &amp;ndash; his formal training is in [[mechanical engineering]] &amp;ndash; and inexperience in debates might lead some to conclude that Ham won the debate.&lt;ref name=csm /&gt; "I am by no means an expert on most of this," Nye later admitted, but added, "In this situation, our skeptical arguments are not the stuff of Ph.Ds. It's elementary science and common sense."&lt;ref name=underestimate&gt;{{cite news |last=Lovan |first=Dylan T. |title=Bill Nye says he underestimated debate's impact |agency=AP Online |date=April 16, 2014 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-6423e6ff064f4ca38c7ef4b56fa04bea.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the event, Nye had lunch with scientists who specialize in evolutionary theory and traveled to [[Oakland, California]], to meet with the staff of [[National Center for Science Education]] (NCSE), an advocacy group for teaching evolution.&lt;ref name=underestimate /&gt; In an op-ed for [[CNN]], Nye answered critics, saying, "In short, I decided to participate in the debate because I felt it would draw attention to the importance of science education here in the United States."&lt;ref name=nyewhy&gt;{{cite web |last=Nye |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Nye |title=Why I'm debating creationist Ken Ham |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=February 4, 2014 |url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/04/why-im-debating-creationist-ken-ham/ |accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later conceded that he had underestimated the debate's impact, saying he expected it to draw attention comparable to his scholarly presentations at college campuses.&lt;ref name=underestimate /&gt;

Leaders of two [[humanism|humanist]] groups &amp;ndash; the [[American Humanist Association]] (AHA) and the [[Center for Inquiry]] &amp;ndash; praised Nye's decision to participate in the debate.&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{cite news |last=Winston |first=Kimberly |title=Ham-on-Nye debate pits atheists, creationists |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=January 30, 2014 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/ham-on-nye-debate-pits-atheists-creationists/2014/01/30/140d58ee-89ec-11e3-a760-a86415d0944d_story.html |accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; AHA director of development and communications Maggie Ardiente told the ''[[Washington Post]]'', "I am looking at statistics and they tell me people like Ken Ham and other creationists are being very effective and that is a serious problem. We can't just ignore that. We have to challenge people like Ken Ham so I support the debate 100 percent."&lt;ref name=wapo /&gt; [[Debbie Goddard]], the Center for Inquiry's director of outreach, concurred: "If we don't let [creationists'] ideas see the light of day we can't develop the tools to address them. And we don't just need the tools of facts and evidence, but also of understanding their views and compassion for them if we want to be effective at changing their minds."&lt;ref name=wapo /&gt;

The debate lasted two and a half hours.&lt;ref name=lovandebate /&gt; During his opening statement, Ham declared, "I believe science has been hijacked by secularists."&lt;ref name=redlands /&gt; He followed up by pointing to several examples of scientists who profess a belief in YEC, most notably [[Raymond Vahan Damadian]], a pioneer in the field of [[magnetic resonance imaging]].&lt;ref name=whowon&gt;{{cite news |last=Chowdhury |first=Sudeshna |title=Bill Nye versus Ken Ham: Who Won? |magazine=Christian Science Monitor |date=February 5, 2014 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-357806905.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ham also drew a distinction between "historical science" and "observational science", a distinction the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' notes is unique to creation scientists.&lt;ref name=whowon /&gt; "We observe things in the present, and we're assuming that has always happened in the past," said Ham, adding, "You've got a problem, because you weren't there."&lt;ref name=5arguments&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Neil |first=Tyler |title=Science vs. Bible? 5 Arguments for and Against Creationism From the Ken Ham, Bill Nye Debate |magazine=[[Christian Post]] |date=February 5, 2014 |url=http://global.christianpost.com/news/science-vs-bible-the-5-best-arguments-for-and-against-creationism-from-the-ken-ham-bill-nye-debate-114005/pageall.html |accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his rebuttal, Nye asked, "Why should we accept your word for it that natural law changed 3,000 years ago and we have no record of it?"&lt;ref name=5arguments /&gt;

Nye cited [[radiometric dating]], [[ice core]] data, and the light from distant stars to argue that the Earth must be much older than young Earth creationists like Ham theorize.&lt;ref name=whowon /&gt; Ham argued that these various dating methods are untrustworthy because they often give varying ages for the same artifacts.&lt;ref name=5arguments /&gt;

The [[Genesis flood narrative]], which Nye repeatedly referred to as "Ken Ham's great flood", was a major topic of discussion, with Nye arguing that a boat constructed according to the parameters given for [[Noah's Ark]] in the [[Book of Genesis]] would not float.&lt;ref name=redlands /&gt;&lt;ref name=whowon /&gt; Nye also calculated that, if there were 7,000 "kinds" of animals on the Ark, on average, 11 new species would have had to come into existence every day for the Earth to contain all presently known species.&lt;ref name=5arguments /&gt;

Towards the end of the debate, Ham admitted that nothing would change his mind concerning his views on [[creationism]], whereas Nye acknowledged that, if enough convincing evidence were presented to him, he would change his mind immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arel|first1=Dan|title=Did Bill Nye Hurt Science|url=http://new.www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-arel/did-bill-nye-hurt-science_b_4733386.html|website=www.huffingtonpost|publisher=HuffingtonPost.Inc|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
No score was kept to declare a winner in the debate.&lt;ref name=underestimate /&gt; Prior to the event, Ham commented, "I don't see it as a debate to win or lose. I don't believe people should go away saying 'Bill Nye won' or 'Ken Ham won.' I want to passionately deal with what I believe, and I want Bill Nye to passionately speak on what he believes."&lt;ref name=redlands /&gt; In a letter published in ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' after the debate, Nye wrote that by "a strong majority of accounts, I bested him."&lt;ref name=underestimate /&gt;

[[File:Jerry Coyne, American professor of biology at the University of Chicago.jpg|thumb|upright|Biologist Jerry Coyne wrote that Nye won the debate.]]
Scientists typically stated that Nye won the debate.&lt;ref name=whowon /&gt; [[University of Chicago]] biologist [[Jerry Coyne]] contested Ham's distinction between historical science and observational science: "Science based on historical reconstruction, when done properly, is just as valid as science based on direct, real-time observation."&lt;ref name=whowon /&gt; While Coyne felt the debate may have given undeserved credibility to the creationist viewpoint, he concluded that, "The debate was Ham's to win and he lost. And the debate was Nye's to lose and he won."&lt;ref name=whowon /&gt; Science blogger [[Greg Laden]], who had earlier expressed concerns about Nye's lack of evolutionary expertise, believed Nye's victory was as lop-sided as the [[Seattle Seahawks]]' victory over the [[Denver Broncos]] in the recently played [[Super Bowl XLVIII]].&lt;ref name=whowon /&gt; He noted that Nye charmed the "evangelical audience" with his style, while the NCSE noted that Ham &amp;ndash; "no mean orator", according to the NCSE &amp;ndash; "sometimes rambled far afield, and [his presentation] often raced by so quickly that it was hard even to know what he was saying".&lt;ref name=whowon /&gt; ''[[Daily Beast]]'' writer Michael Schulson, however, used the same Seahawks-Broncos analogy to declare Ham the resounding victor. Although Schulson agreed with Nye's underlying scientific message, and allowed that Nye "had his moments," he wrote that "it was easy to pick out the smarter man on the stage. Oddly, it was the same man who was arguing that the earth is 6,000 years old." He believed that Ham's simpler presentation made him sound like "a reasonable human being", while Nye lost his audience by "sounding like a clueless geek, even if his points were scientifically valid".&lt;ref name=dailybeast /&gt;

Evangelical blogger Ezra Byer credited Ham with raising awareness of the Christian message, but felt he failed to provide compelling factual evidence for his beliefs.&lt;ref name=whowon /&gt; As partial explanation, Byer noted, "As I watched Mr. Ham's mannerisms, you could sense a tremendous Spirit about him. He was gracious and the power of God showed through his life. There were multiple times I believed he could have hammered Nye on some of his inconsistencies but in my opinion chose not to."&lt;ref name=whowon /&gt;

[[Biologos Foundation|The Biologos Foundation]] stated "that one of the lasting effects of this debate will be to further alienate Christianity from science in the public consciousness."&lt;ref name=Biologos/&gt; The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] said that the debate "drew world attention, once again, on the United States as the home of whacky Christianity."&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2014/03/20/3968199.htm |title= Too Much Faith in Schools: The Rise of Christian Schooling in Australia |department= Opinion: ABC Religion &amp; Ethics |first= Marion |last= Maddox |date=March 2014 |work=[[ABC Online|ABC Online (Australian Broadcasting Network)]] |accessdate= 15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Behe]], a biologist at [[Lehigh University]] and an advocate of [[intelligent design]], felt that by "talking on about the age of the Earth [rather] than on the elegance and complexities of life", both Ham and Nye lost the debate.&lt;ref name=whowon /&gt; [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America#The Episcopacy|Metropolitan Nicholas]] of the Greek Orthodox Church, who was trained as a scientist before taking [[holy orders]], also criticized both Nye's and Ham's approach to the debate, saying that "Research that is done to challenge God, has the disease of prejudice. Research is done to discover scientific truth. What problem is there with someone wanting to broaden the horizons of their thoughts and knowledge? God is approached better this way. God is not an ideology that we should by all means defend, but we believe in Him because He is Truth. In this sense, even scientific truth reveals Him. If He is still questioned, it is time to find out about Him. A believer who fears scientific research, fears the truth. Perhaps he is a believer who does not believe."&lt;ref name="Nicholas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/ken-ham-bill-nye-meet-biologos-metropolitan-nicholas/|title=Ken Ham &amp; Bill Nye, Meet Met. Nicholas &amp; BioLogos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 27, 2014, Ham announced that the publicity the debate generated for AiG had spurred fundraising for its stalled [[Ark Encounter]] project, allowing the first phase of construction &amp;ndash; a {{convert|510|ft|m|adj=on}} reconstruction of Noah's Ark estimated to cost $73 million &amp;ndash; to begin.&lt;ref name=arkpark&gt;{{cite news |title=Noah's Ark Project Spurred by Evolution Debate |newspaper=The Gazette |date=February 27, 2014 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-35743340.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the announcement, Nye told the Associated Press he hopes the project "goes out of business", adding "If [Ham] builds that ark, it's my strong opinion, it's bad for the commonwealth of Kentucky and bad for scientists based in Kentucky and bad for the U.S. And I'm not joking, bad for the world."&lt;ref name=arkpark /&gt;

'''[[Buddhism]] in [[Norway]]''' has existed since the beginning of the 1970s, after immigration from countries with Buddhist populations, mainly [[Vietnam]]. [[Buddhistforbundet]] (''The Buddhist Federation'') in [[Norway]] was established as a religious society in 1979 by two Buddhist groups (''The Zen School'' and ''Karma Tashi Ling buddhistsenter'') who wanted to create a common organization to preserve issues of common interest. As of 2013, there are over 30 to 50 thousand (between 0.7%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_170_2.asp|title=Religious Adherents, 2010 - Norway|publisher=World Christian Database|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and up to 1%&lt;ref name="Special Eurobarometer 393"&gt;''[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf Eurobarometer Biotechnology report 2010]'' p.381&lt;/ref&gt; of the total population) registered Buddhists in Norway. Around 5% of them are ethnic [[Norwegians]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antropologi.info/blog/nyheter/2005/feiret_buddha_fodselsdag_flere_og_flere]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Murphy was named VH1/''Vogue''{{'}}s Model of the Year.&lt;ref name="fashionmodeldirectory1"/&gt; She played Dubbie in [[Barry Levinson]]'s film ''[[Liberty Heights]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rainer |first=Peter |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/reviews/1572/ |title="Liberty Heights,""Sleepy Hollow," and "The World Is Not Enough" |publisher=Nymag.com |date=1998-11-29 |accessdate=2010-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of the "Modern Muses" on the November 1999 millennium cover of American ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sassybella.com/2007/04/vogues-worlds-next-top-models-cover/|title=Vogue’s ‘World’s Next Top Models’ cover|last=Lee|first=Helen|date=April 11, 2007|publisher=SassyBella.com|accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was chosen to represent [[Calvin Klein]]'s perfume, ''Contradiction''.&lt;ref name="askmen1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/women/models_100/118_carolyn_murphy.html#famous |title=Carolyn Murphy Pictures, Photo Galleries, Bio &amp; Rating |publisher=AskMen |date=1975-08-11 |accessdate=2010-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, during a photo shoot for ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'', the photographer noticed her resemblance to the actress [[Gene Tierney]] and dubbed her "The blonde Gene Tierney".&lt;ref&gt;''Elle'', September issue 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shmaryahu Yosef Chaim Kanievsky''' (b. 1928) is an [[Israel]]i [[rabbi]] and ''[[posek]]'' living in [[Bnei Brak]], [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="nerechad1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nerechad.org/about-rabbi-chaim |title=About Rabbi Chaim |publisher=Nerechad.org |date= |accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kanievsky is considered a leading authority&lt;ref&gt;http://acheinu.co.il/?CategoryID=487&amp;ArticleID=6061&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jewish]] society.&lt;ref&gt;http://artscroll.com/Books/9781422618684.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://blog.aishhaolam.com/2016/11/recommendations-by-the-gadol-hador-rav-chaim-kanievsky-to-merit-children/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
[[File:Rebchaim.JPG|thumb|A visitor seeking the rabbi's advice]]
Kanievsky was born January 8, 1928, in [[Pinsk]], [[Second Polish Republic]], to Rabbi [[Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky]] (also known as the Steipler Gaon) and Rebbitzen Miriam Karelitz, sister of Rabbi [[Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz|Avraham Yeshayahu Karelitz]] (also known as the Chazon Ish). He married [[Batsheva Kanievsky|Batsheva Elyashiv]], daughter of Rabbi [[Yosef Sholom Eliashiv]] (grandson of Rav [[Shlomo Elyashiv]], also known as the Leshem) and granddaughter of Rav [[Aryeh Levin]] (known as the "[[Tzadik|Tzaddik]] of [[Jerusalem]]").&lt;ref name="nerechad1"/&gt;

During the 1948 [[Israeli War of Independence]], Rav Kanievsky, then a student at the Lomza Yeshiva, was conscripted for temporary army service in the general mobilization. He was assigned to stand guard on a large hill near [[Jaffa]].&lt;ref name="Legendary"/&gt;{{rp|376}}

Rabbi Kanievsky's wife died in 2011. He lives in Bnei Brak, and receives thousands of visitors every year from Jews seeking religious advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rabbimeirbaalhaneis.com/Rabbi%20Chaim%20Kanievsky.asp |title=Biography of Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky (born 1928) and his relationship to the Rabbi Meir Baal Haneis charity in Israel |publisher=Rabbimeirbaalhaneis.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kanievsky is the official rabbi and spiritual guide for the non-profit organization Belev Echad, which was founded in Israel on 2011 and is dedicated to assist sick and disabled children and adults.&lt;ref name=Ltrs8&gt;{{cite web

It has been recognised by the haredi community since the passing of Rav Steinman in December 2017, that Rav Chaim Kanievsky and Rav Gershon Edelstein are the leaders of the haredi community.[1]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vosizneias.com/286933/2017/12/13/jerusalem-analysis-after-rav-shteinman-passing-who-will-lead-the-haredim/|title=Jerusalem - Analysis: After Rav Shteinman Passing Who Will Lead The Haredim|website=www.vosizneias.com|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since his arrival to Israel as a young boy, Rabbi Kanievsky has never left the Holy Land to visit other countries.

== Statements and rulings ==
In 2012, Rav Kanievsky ruled that it is forbidden to possess or use a smartphone without individual permission from a halakhic authority, and that owners are not allowed to sell their phones, but should instead burn them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ari |first=Judah |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/burn-your-iphones-leading-rabbi-rules/ |title=Burn your iPhones, top rabbi orders |publisher=The Times of Israel |date=2012-09-23 |accessdate=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-jason-miller/apples-jerusalem-problem_b_1923074.html |title=Apple's Jerusalem Problem |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=2012-12-03 |accessdate=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nathan JeffaySeptember 18, 2013 |url=http://forward.com/news/184099/kosher-smart-phone-arrives-as-ultra-orthodox-tech/ |title=Kosher Smart Phone Arrives as Ultra-Orthodox Tech Taboo Shifts - News – |publisher=Forward.com |date=2013-09-18 |accessdate=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ravidyesterday |first=Barak |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/1.584241 |title=Haredi users of 'non-kosher' phones revealed through security loophole - News - Haaretz - Israel News |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2014-04-07 |accessdate=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israeltoday.co.il/NewsItem/tabid/178/nid/30063/Default.aspx |title=Rabbi: Never Marry a Man With an iPhone - Israel Today &amp;#124; Israel News |publisher=Israel Today |date= |accessdate=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he instructed [[United Hatzalah]] paramedics that in the event of a terrorist attack, they should not treat the terrorists before the victims, even if the terrorist is more seriously injured, and could even leave the terrorist to die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contact Editor Hezki Baruch, 31/12/15 15:54 |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/205765 |title=Rabbi Kanievsky instructs paramedics: Don't save terrorists |publisher=Israel National News |date= |accessdate=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondoweiss.net/2016/03/israeli-medics-are-leaving-wounded-palestinians-to-bleed-to-death/ |title=Israeli medics are leaving wounded Palestinians to bleed to death – Mondoweiss |publisher=Mondoweiss.net |date=2016-03-23 |accessdate=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Rav Chaim declared that medicinal cannabis was [[Chametz|kosher for Passover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Elsa Vulliamy |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/marijuana-is-kosher-for-passover-leading-rabbi-rules-a6995761.html |title=Marijuana is kosher for Passover, leading rabbi rules |publisher=The Independent |date=2016-04-22 |accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He ruled in 2017 that reporting instances of sexual child abuse to the police is consistent with [[halakha|Jewish law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/landedpages/printarticle.aspx?id=393109 |title=Leading haredi rabbi says sexual abuse should be reported to police |publisher=Jpost.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ralph |url=http://matzav.com/video-rav-chaim-kanievsky-on-child-abuser-logically-he-should-be-reported-to-police |title=Video: Rav Chaim Kanievsky on Molester: "Logically, He Should Be Reported to Police" |publisher=Matzav.com |date=2015-02-26 |accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanievsky has made several statements that indicate he feels the coming of the [[Moshiach|Messiah]] is imminent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4032909,00.html |title=Ynetnews Jewish Scene - 'Arab unrest signals Messiah's coming' |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingisraelnews.com/47179/leading-israeli-rabbi-chaim-kanievsky-gives-new-clue-final-messianic-coming-jewish-world/#VXlipwdLuDCcq8Yf.97 |title=Leading Israeli Rabbi Kanievsky Gives New Clue to Final Messianic Coming - Israel News |publisher=Breakingisraelnews.com |date=2015-08-19 |accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Title * |url=http://www.thecooljew.com/2014/07/rav-chaim-kanievsky-speaks-about-moshiach/ |title=Rav Chaim Kanievsky Speaks About Moshiach |publisher=TheCoolJew.com |date=2016-12-16 |accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Christianity]]''' is a prevalent religion in '''[[Denmark]]'''. Aside from Lutheranism, there is a small [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] minority, as well as small Protestant denominations such as the [[Baptist Union of Denmark]] and the [[Reformed Synod of Denmark]].

Denmark is today a very secular country, but has a culture that is heavily influenced by Christianity.

However, in similar fashion to the rest of Scandinavia, and also Britain, only a small minority (less than 5% of the total population) attends churches for Sunday services.&lt;ref name="report 2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2009/127307.htm |title=Denmark – Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor |year=2009 |work=International Religious Freedom Report 2009 |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/13117/religion-europe-trust-filling-pews.aspx |title=Religion in Europe: Trust Not Filling the Pews |last=Manchin |first= Robert |date=21 September 2004 |work=Gallup Poll |publisher=[[The Gallup Organization]] |accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the number of people leaving the Church has been on the rise: in 2012 21,118 Danes left the Church, an increase of 55% in comparison to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dst.dk/pukora/epub/Nyt/2013/NR103.pdf dst.dk, "Kraftig stigning i udmeldelser af folkekirken", February 28, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals automatically become members when baptized, as most people born in Denmark are at birth, and cannot leave of their own until they are 18 years old. Members are not informed of their membership or their ability to leave. Further, there are no standard formulas for leaving the church; one must personally contact the priest or office of one's parish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/forms/R0710.aspx?id=163780|title=Bekendtgørelse om stiftelse og ophør af medlemskab af folkekirken|website=retsinformation.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/forms/R0710.aspx?id=142350|title=Bekendtgørelse af lov om medlemskab af folkekirken, kirkelig betjening og sognebåndsløsning|website=retsinformation.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Protestant groups ==
A small [[Baptist]] community has existed since the 1840s, and is represented by the [[Baptist Union of Denmark]]. The Union claimed 55 churches and 5,412 congregants in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bwanet.org/about-us2/statistics#e Statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627073219/http://www.bwanet.org/about-us2/statistics |date=2012-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reformed churches|Reformed Protestantism]] is represented by four churches united in the [[Reformed Synod of Denmark]]. These are mainly ethnic congregations, including two [[Huguenot Church|Huguenot churches]] and a [[German Reformation|German Reformed]] church, founded in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reformiert-online.net/adressen/detail.php?id=1070335&amp;lg=eng Den reformerte Meighed i Fredericia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reformiert-online.net"&gt;[http://www.reformiert-online.net/adressen/detail.php?id=1070334&amp;lg=eng Deutsch-Reformierte Kirche zu Kopenhagen]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reformiert-online.net/adressen/detail.php?id=1070333&amp;lg=eng Eglise réformée française]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Korean Reformed Church founded in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reformiert-online.net/adressen/detail.php?id=1070336&amp;lg=eng  	  Korean-Reformed Church in Denmark]&lt;/ref&gt; The German Reformed church also includes some Dutch, Swiss, Hungarian and American members, as well as Danes.&lt;ref name="reformiert-online.net"/&gt;
There is an Anglican church and fellowship in Copenhagen and smaller congregations of Anglicans and Episcopalians in many Danish cities.

A 2015 study estimates some 4,000 Christian believers from a Muslim background in the country, most of them belonging to some form of Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnstone|first1=Patrick|last2=Miller|first2=Duane|title=Believers in Christ from a Muslim Background: A Global Census|journal=IJRR|date=2015|volume=11|page=14|url=https://www.academia.edu/16338087/Believers_in_Christ_from_a_Muslim_Background_A_Global_Census|accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catholic Church ==

[[File:SanktAnsgar01.jpg|thumb|[[St. Ansgar's Cathedral]], Copenhagen]]

After the [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|separation]] of the Church of Denmark from the Catholic Church in 1536, the Catholic Church remained illegal in the country for over three centuries. The Church was able to reestablish itself after the Constitution of 1849 granted religious freedom to the Kingdom. Currently the country is covered by the [[Diocese of Copenhagen (Roman Catholic)|Diocese of Copenhagen]] with 48 parishes in Denmark proper and two more in the Faeroe Islands and Greenland. There are nearly 40,000 Catholics in Denmark, though nearly a third are foreign born and others are born of foreign parents (for example, Denmark's [[Polish people|Polish]] community, of which the current [[Czeslaw Kozon|Bishop of Copenhagen]] is a member). Nevertheless, ethnic Danes are still the largest group among the Church's congregants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katolsk.dk/1635/ The Catholic Church in Denmark]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eastern Orthodoxy ==
Adherents of [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] in Denmark are traditionally organized in accordance with patrimonial ecclesiastical jurisdictions. Eastern Orthodox Danes of Greek origin belong to the Metropolis of Sweden and Scandinavia, under the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. Those of Russian origin are directly under the Patriarch of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ortodoxy.dk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=74 Russian Orthodox Church in Denmark]&lt;/ref&gt; Those of Serbian origin belong to the [[Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Britain and Scandinavia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svetigeorgije.dk/dk/ Serbian Orthodox Church in Denmark]&lt;/ref&gt; Those of Romanian origin belong to the Diocese of Northern Europe, of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.episcopiascandinavia.se/episcopia/istoric// Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Northern Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oriental Orthodoxy ==
Adherents of [[Oriental Orthodox Christianity]] in Denmark are also traditionally organized in accordance with their patrimonial ecclesiastical jurisdictions, each community having its own parishes and priests. Oriental Orthodox Danes of [[Armenians in Denmark|Armenian]] origin belong to the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/kirke-tro/den-armenske-kirke-godkendt Armenian Apostolic Church in Denmark]&lt;/ref&gt; Those of Coptic origin belong to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church in Europe|Coptic Orthodox Diocese of Stockholm and Scandinavia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koptisk.dk/index_EN.html Coptic Orthodox Church in Denmark]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Door of Prophecies''' or '''Gate of Prophecies''' is a large door inside the [[Syrian Monastery]], of [[Wadi El Natrun]] (Natron Valley) in Egypt, that features symbolic diagrams depicting the past and the future of the Christian faith through the eyes of Christian monks of the tenth century. Several centuries ago, that location was used mainly by Syrian monks, however today the monastery is used and preserved by [[Copt]]ic monks and the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]], as both Churches have been in friendship and alliance since early Christianity. The Door of Prophecies dates to the beginning of the tenth century, around 913–914 AD, according to the [[Syriac language]] inscriptions on it, during the papacy of [[Pope Gabriel I of Alexandria]] (910–921).  The panels on the large door divide and represent Christian epochs through time, [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]]s preceding the time of its construction, the tenth century and also prophesizing and predicting future time periods. 

The door of prophecies is a screen of a main [[sanctuary]] inside the monastery. It consists of six vertical leaves (panels) and seven horizontal rows, three forming a valve on each side. Each one of the six leaves has seven panels of ebony magnificently inlaid with ivory, however, today some of the panels are not in their original condition. From top to bottom they represent seven epochs which are believed to cover the history of Christianity, its past and future, highlighting its golden age, periods of major changes, hardships, and persecution. 

The historical and spiritual interpretations of the panels are highly individual. The following are the seven epochs:

|-
| '''First epoch''', represented by the '''first row'''. &lt;br /&gt;
In the centre, there are icons of Jesus Christ and the Holy Virgin. 
The other icons, on both sides, represent the strong relationship between the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] and the [[Church of Antioch]], i.e. the Coptic and Syrian patriarchates. The Syrian Orthodox Church of the earliest centuries of Christianity followed the leadership of the [[Church of Antioch]]. The monastery where the Door of Prophecies is located was built by Syrian monks.

On the left are icons of St. [[Mark the Evangelist]] and [[Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria]], representing the Church of Alexandria. 

On the right are icons of St. [[Ignatius of Antioch]] and St. [[Severus of Antioch]], representing the Church of Antioch.

The order from left to right is St. Dioscorus, St. Mark, Jesus Christ, the Holy Virgin, St. Severus, St. Ignatius.

The '''Dreamspell''' is an esoteric calendar in part inspired by the [[Maya calendar]] by [[New Age]] spiritualist, [[Mayanism|Mayanist]] philosopher, and author [[José Argüelles]], initiated in 1987 and released as a board game in 1992.

==Description==

===General overview===
This is loosely based on the 365-day [[solar calendar]] called the [[Haab]], but most importantly focused on the 260-day sacred calendar called the [[Tzolkin]], which Argüelles claims to be based on a fourth-dimensional pattern called a "galactic spin". Argüelles interprets this calendar as part of what he calls a 'radiogenetic game board' that relates to both the [[I-Ching]], the 64-unit [[DNA]] code, and many other "divinatory" systems, including the cosmology of Ibn al-Arabi of the 28 lunar mansions and the 22 Major Arcana of the Tarot.

===The number 13===
The number 13 in the Dreamspell calendar appears both as the "galactic tone" of the daily galactic signature, as well as in the 13 Moons of 28 days each are the "months" of the calendar. The 13 Moons are named after the 13 galactic tones. The names of the 13 galactic tones are: ''Magnetic, Lunar, Electric, Self-Existing, Overtone, Rhythmic, Resonant, Galactic, Solar, Spectral, Planetary, Crystal, and Cosmic''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawoftime.org/thirteenmoon/basics.html Law of Time (official website of José Argüelles’ nonprofit, the Foundation for the Law of Time)—“13 Moon Calendar Basics”:]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 20 solar seals representing the days===
The names of the 20 solar seals used to name the days are ''Red Dragon, White Wind, Blue Night, Yellow Seed, Red Serpent, White World-Bridger, Blue Hand, Yellow Star, Red Moon, White Dog, Blue Monkey, Yellow Human, Red Skywalker, White Wizard, Blue Eagle, Yellow Warrior, Red Earth, White Mirror, Blue Storm, and Yellow Sun''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dr-rock.biz/ru.html The 20 Day Glyphs of the Dreamspell Calendar:]&lt;/ref&gt; These 20 solar seals are continually repeated in a 20-day cycle. The 20-day cycle repeated 13 times (20 × 13) equals 260 days or one Tzolkin or "galactic spin" as it is called in the Dreamspell: Journey of Timeship Earth 2013.

===260 possible different names for the days===
The name of the solar seal of the day (of 20 solar seals) and the name of the galactic tone (of 13 tones) combine to create a galactic signature for every day. This generates a list of 20 × 13=260 possible day names (galactic signatures). &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawoftime.org/thirteenmoon/tutorial.html Tutorial on the 13 Moon Dreamspell Calendar, including showing how every day's galactic signature is formed:]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawoftime.org/timeshipearth/bookofkin.html List of all 260 galactic signatures in the Dreamspell calendar from the original Dreamspell Book of Kin):]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The seven-day week===
The calendar also uses the seven-day [[week]]. The names of the seven days are taken from a text called ''Introduction to Cosmic Science'' which is claimed to be of extraterrestrial origin, written (claimed to have been channeled) by Enrique Castillo Rincon, a UFO contactee,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bluedolphinpublishing.com/rincon.htm&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1970s. (This text is reproduced in full, as an appendix to ''Book of the Avatar, Cosmic History Chronicles Volume II'' written by Argüelles and South. The work of Enrique Castillo Rincon ) The seven names are what "Cosmic Science" refers to as the seven "radial plasmas" sub-sub-atomic particles:  ''Dali, Seli, Gamma, Kali, Alpha, Limi, and Sillio''

Each day of the 7-day week of the 13-Moon calendar is assigned a glyph (distinct from the 20 solar seals for the dates) that is also one of four colors red, white, blue, or yellow — Dali's glyph is yellow, Seli's glyph is red, Gamma's glyph is white, Kali's glyph is blue, Alpha's glyph is yellow, Limi's glyph is red, and Sillio's glyph is white.

In the system of the 13-Moon calendar, these seven "radial plasmas" also correspond to the seven [[chakra]]s.  However, the chakras each day represents are not in the same order as the placement of the chakras on the body, but according to a [[spiral]] pattern that Argüelles provides on his website.

The glyph for ''Dali'' (yellow) symbolizes the [[sahasrara]] chakra (seventh chakra); the glyph for ''Seti'' (red) symbolized the [[muladhara]] chakra (first chakra); the glyph for ''Gamma'' (white) symbolizes the [[ajna]] (sixth chakra); the glyph for ''Kali'' (blue) symbolizes the [[svadhisthana]] (second chakra); the glyph for ''Alpha'' (yellow) symbolizes the [[vishuddha]] (fifth chakra); the glyph for ''Limi'' (red) symbolizes the [[manipura]] (third chakra); and the glyph for ''Sillio'' (white) symbolizes the [[anahata]] (fourth chakra).
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawoftime.org/thirteenmoon/tutorial.html Law of Time (José Argüelles’ official website)—“13 Moon Calendar Tutorial”:]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since seven is a factor of 28, the 1st of each month is always a Dali and the 28th of each month is always a Silio.

The [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary day]] at the end of the year, since it is not part of any month, is also not part of any week either. Thus every date of every month always occurs on exactly the same day. This system of every date always occurring on the same day of the week and not including the year end day in any month or as any day of the week is standard for a 13-month calendar.

Of course the days of the week do not correlate with the days of the week named on the Gregorian calendar since the "day out of time" (25 July) is not assigned as being any day of the week.

===Leap years===
The 13 Moon calendar simply counts leap years as a "0.0 Hunab Ku" day – which is also no day of the week or month. Nor is it one of the 260 galactic signatures. This allows the mathematical system of the calendar, which Argüelles calls the "synchronic order", to remain intact. In short, this creates an even cycle which repeats perfectly every 52 years. For example, if today is Magnetic Moon Dali 1, Red Magnetic Dragon – 52 years from now it will be again, Magnetic Moon Dali 1, Red Magnetic Dragon. This allows every date in the Dreamspell calendar to always synchronize perfectly with a date in the Gregorian calendar – in other words, February 29 will always be 0.0 Hunab Ku. In the original [[Mesoamerican calendar]], there were 13 days not part of any month at the end of a 52-year cycle to account for leap years.

The date called in the Gregorian calendar 29 February falls every four years between 22 Galactic and 23 Galactic. In the original [[Roman calendar]], a [[lunisolar calendar]], a 13th leap month called [[Mercedonius]] was periodically inserted between 23 February and 24 February to keep the calendar in line with the [[solar year]]. In most 13-month calendars, the leap year day is added every four years as an intercalary day between the year end day and the New Year's Day. However, doing this to the Dreamspell 13 Moon calendar would bring the calendar out of sync with the 52-year cycle where the galactic signature and day of the year return every 52 years.

If the Gregorian calendar weren't in existence at all, the 0.0 Hunab Ku would still be the necessary intercalary day to keep the 52-year cycle (of 18,980 days) intact.

===Numbering of the years===
So far there is no "official" numbering system for the years. The years are simply named after the first day of the year. For example, a year that begins with a "Blue Magnetic Storm" day is called "Blue Magnetic Storm Year". This creates a cycle of 52 years, made out of four cycles of 13 years each. The basis of the Dreamspell Calendar is that time is not linear, but cyclic, and so does not require a strict "numbering" of years.

However, Argüelles recently address this issue because many followers of the calendar inquired how to number the days. He explained a system, similar to the dating system of the Mayan calendar (for example, 13.0.0.0.0). The system simply counts from the first year of the Dreamspell (1987), with the initials "NS" – standing for "New Sirius" cycle, since the 52-year cycle of the Dreamspell calendar is the same as the 52 years it takes Sirius B to orbit Sirius A. For example, if it is 23 years after the beginning of the Dreamspell, month 1, day 2, the date is "NS1.23.1.2"

This system, as mentioned above, is similar to the dating system of the "Mayan calendar" cycle which "ends" on December 21, 2012. However, there have recently been discovered dated Mayan artifacts which predict dates well into the future, far beyond 2012:

"It is interesting that recent decodings of the hieroglyphs at Palenque, which are understood to have been made during the reign of Pacal the Great, refer to dates beyond the end of the Long Count calendar. On the Tablet of the Inscriptions at Palenque a date of 1.0.0.0.0.8 5 Lamat 1 Mol can be inferred – otherwise known as 21 October 4772, almost 3000 years in the future. Perhaps we can deduce from this that Pacal himself believed that the end of the fifth age did not represent the end of time or of the Earth, and that his name would be still mentioned in the sixth age." David Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;133, ''The Mayan Prophecy 2012'' (2009)&lt;ref&gt;David Douglas, p. 133, ''The Mayan Prophecy 2012'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
According to Argüelles, two of the main purposes of the calendar are:

# To synchronize [[human being]]s with our "[[Milky Way Galaxy|galactic]] roots" by tuning us in to the [[spiritual energy]] from [[Hunab Ku]], a being Argüelles asserts is the governing [[deity]] of the [[Milky Way Galaxy]].&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;José Argüelles. ''[[The Mayan Factor]].'' 1987. Retrieved on December 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
# To convert [[human]]ity from thinking that ''Time is Money'' to thinking that ''Time is [[Art]]'' and thus give human beings more scope for their [[creativity]].

==Popularity==
The Dreamspell calendar is popular{{cn|date=November 2017}} among many different people from many walks of life,{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and has been translated into numerous languages.

Some people{{who?|date=November 2017}} use the complex symbolism of the calendar as a means of [[divination]].

The anthropologist Will Black conducted research into José Argüelles’ Planet Art Network for several years. In his 2010 book ''Beyond the End of the World – 2012 and Apocalypse,'' Black documents a general loss of interest in Dreamspell and in PAN in the last few years.

Black points out that as general interest in the [[2012 phenomenon]] increased as a result of the proximity of the "end date", the significance of PAN and the value placed on Argüelles’ ideas waned. Although Argüelles and his Dreamspell system was instrumental in encouraging people to consider the meaning of 2012, further investigation by individuals tended to cause people to look beyond Argüelles’ system, according to Black. In fact, interest in 2012 snowballed so rapidly in the last few years that many of those who latterly became interested in 2012 may have been quite oblivious to the early contribution of Argüelles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2866">'''DREAM''' (short for "Drug Resources Enhancement against Aids and Malnutrition", formerly "Drug Resource Enhancement against AIDS in Mozambique") is an AIDS therapy program promoted by the [[Christian]] [[Community of Sant'Egidio]]. The Community of Sant'Egidio, based in Rome, was formerly involved in the peace talks in Mozambique, facilitating the eleven rounds of negotiations in Rome that helped to end the [[Mozambican Civil War]]. The Community has worked closely with both the Mozambican Ministry of Health and the United States' [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief|PEPFAR]] in order to implement the DREAM program. The DREAM program is designed to give access to free [[Antiretroviral drug|ARV]] treatment with generic [[HAART]] drugs to the poor in Africa on a large scale: So far, 5,000 people are receiving ARV treatment, especially in [[Mozambique]], but the program is being built up also in other countries, including [[Angola]], [[Cameroon]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Guinea]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Nigeria]], [[Swaziland]] and [[Tanzania]]. Despite being free, the program aims at excellence in treatment, providing the best existent range of drugs (HAART) and regular blood testing according to European standards. It is linked with a nutrition program as well as guidance and sanitary education by volunteers (other HIV patients taking part in the program), which encourages new patients to comply and come to the appointments. The compliance rate is very high (94 percent). The annual cost per person and year of the program is $800.

[[File:Eugen Drewermann.jpg|thumb|Eugen Drewermann during his first U.S. lecture series in 1999]]
'''Eugen Drewermann''' (born 20 June 1940) is a [[Germany|German]] church critic, theologian, peace activist and former [[Roman Catholic]] priest. His work has been translated into more than a dozen languages.

Drewermann was born in [[Bergkamen]] near [[Dortmund]]. He is best known in Germany for his work toward a non-violent form of Christianity, which, he believes, requires an integration of [[Depth psychology]] into [[Exegesis]] and [[Theology]]. Trained in philosophy, theology, psychoanalysis, and comparative religious studies, he criticized the Roman Catholic Church's literal and biologistic interpretations of miracles, the virgin birth, [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]], and [[Resurrection]] as superstitious and medieval. He called on Rome to understand biblical stories symbolically in such a way that they can become present and healing to readers today. Drewermann's controversial opinions on Catholic dogma, especially the [[Virgin birth of Jesus]] lead to a letter expressing "deep worry," in 1986 by then-Cardinal Ratzinger,&lt;ref name="Ratzinger"&gt;''A Violent God-Image: An Introduction to the Work of Eugen Drewermann'', p. 17.Beier, M. (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Benedict XVI]], to Drewermann's [[archbishop]], [[Johannes Joachim Degenhardt]].

The struggle propelled Drewermann into the public limelight and culminated in 1991 after he published a radical critique of what he considers to be the Vatican's psychologically cruel and mentally enslaving clergy ideal (''Kleriker: Psychogramm eines Ideals'' [Clergy: Psychogram of an ideal]). Archbishop Degenhardt of Paderborn and the Catholic Bishops Conference of Germany engaged in a long drawn-out and heated debate with Drewermann which was closely followed by media and public. As a consequence, on 7 October 1991, the [[Archbishop]] disallowed him to teach at the Catholic Seminary of Paderborn and, shortly afterwards, revoked his license to preach 1992.

Drewermann has uttered strong and controversial political opinions. He was against the [[Gulf War]], the [[Iraq War]], German participation in the NATO war against Afghanistan, and Israeli Air Raids during the 2006 Lebanon War. In the name of the German Peace Movement, he asked to abolish not only Walter Mixa's office as Military Bishop of Germany but the German military, the [[Bundeswehr]], as such.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friedenskooperative.de/netzwerk/om08-121.htm] Speech held at Bremen Peace March Eastern 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Drewermann has signed public calls to support the [[The Left (Germany)|"Linkspartei"]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presseportal.de/pm/41150/723097/die_linke/] Call to elect Linkspartei 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and delivers speeches on conferences and protest demonstrations of the left.&lt;ref&gt;Linker Protest
[http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/g8-gipfel/linker-protest_aid_62344.html] ''Spiel mir das Lied vom Sozialismus'' Die Linke hat in Bad Doberan zur Kapitalismuskritik geladen. Eugen Drewermann predigt, Oskar Lafontaine schaukelt sich auf, und die Menge singt dazu (Play it again, the song of capitalism. The lefts invites to criticize capitalism in Bad Doberan. Drewermann preaches, Lafontaine gets in the mood and the crowd sings along). In [[Focus (German magazine)]] - by Iris Mayer, Focus-online, 04.06.07&lt;/ref&gt;

Drewermann left the [[Catholic]] Church on his 65th birthday on 20 June 2005, a decision he broadly announced on [[Sandra Maischberger]]s Talkshow in German television.&lt;ref&gt;Menschen bei Maischberger: 2005 - Schluss mit lustig? ARD-Sendung vom 13. Dezember 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Son of a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] father and a [[Catholic]] mother, Drewermann, after finishing grammar school (''[[Abitur]]'') in Germany, studied [[philosophy]] in [[Münster]], [[theology]] in [[Paderborn]] and [[psychoanalysis]] in [[Göttingen]].

==Professional life==
{{expand section|date=January 2018}}
Ordained as a Catholic priest in 1966, he worked as a diocesan priest, student chaplain, and eventually began work in 1974 as assistant priest in the parish of St. George in Paderborn. At the same time, he worked as a [[psychotherapist]], and from 1979 also held lectures in comparative religious studies and [[dogma]]tics at the Catholic Theological Faculty in Paderborn. He continues to hold lectures in Studium generale{{clarify|date=November 2014}} at Paderborn and talks at other universities. [http://www.freewebs.com/drewermann-eugen/newseventsveranstaltungen.htm]

Influenced by [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]], and more recent psychoanalysts, Drewermann radically reinterprets biblical texts according to psychoanalytic, poetic, and existential criteria. His method of interpretation has been clearly outlined in the 1984-1985 two-volume work ''Tiefenpsychologie und Exegese''. His interpretations are as immediate as poetry and aim to rediscover particularly the therapeutic message of Jesus and of the Hebrew prophets, both for the individual and for society at large.

A central topic of Drewermann is the specific way humans experience [[Angst]] (fear) due to our self-reflective capacity. He maintains that religion has as its central task to help calm our human anxiety and to stop its devastating effects on all levels of human life, in its personal, social, and global manifestations. Among his more than 80 books are dozens of titles presenting non-moralistic reinterpretations of nearly all biblical texts, including a monumental three-volume scholarly treatise on Genesis 2-11 (''Strukturen des Bösen'', 1977-8) and a two-volume commentary on the Gospel of Mark; a number of titles on urgent social issues such as war (''Der Krieg und das Christentum'', 1981), the environment (''Der tödliche Fortschritt'', 1982), and burning moral issues such as abortion, the will to live, suicide (''Psychoanalyse und Moraltheologie'', 1982-4, 3 vols); and, most recently, half a dozen volumes on the question of God in light of the findings of modern anthropology (1998), biology (1999), cosmology (2002), neurology (2006–2007); a depth psychological analysis of more than twenty of the most well-known [[fairy tale]]s by the [[Brothers Grimm]] and one by [[Hans Christian Andersen]].

Since 1992, Drewermann has been working as a freelance author and speaker. He has frequent appearances in [[List of German language television channels|German TV]] [[talk show]]s and is invited to lecture all over Germany, Europe, and the world. While his popularity as a church critic was at its maximum when ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' ran a cover story on him in its 1993 Christmas issue, he continues to be a highly sought-after commentator on spiritual, religious and social issues.

He currently has his own monthly [[Talk radio|call-in radio]] show titled ''Redefreiheit'' (Freedom of Speech) in Bremen [https://web.archive.org/web/20080401233735/http://www.radiobremen.de/nordwestradio/redefreiheit/], which was preceded by a prior regular call-in radio show in Berlin.

Drewermann has appeared twice with the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] in Zurich, and has written a book with him on the dialogue among religions. After the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] he described the attacks as the result of complex dynamics in which both sides in the terror war had contributed to the conflict. In agreement with the Dalai Lama, Drewermann called on the West to turn the attacks into an opportunity for peace not revenge.

== Criticism ==
{{expand section|date=December 2015}}
Some Catholic scholars criticised Drewermann for focussing in his work on individual psychology without taking into consideration Christian communities and Christian tradition,&lt;ref name="Keine Exegese"&gt;[[Gerhard Lohfink]], [[Rudolf Pesch]] Tiefenpsychologie und keine Exegese. Eine Auseinandersetzung mit Eugen Drewermann. Katholisches Bibelwerk; Auflage: 2., Aufl. (1988) {{ISBN|3-460-04291-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that Drewermann's approach had the effect of reducing the historical relevance of the [[Gospel]] and [[Revelation]] to a mere collection of texts used to cure individual anxiety. A similar approach to Drewemann's work came from psychological scholars Albert Görres and Helmuth Benesch.&lt;ref&gt;Benesch, Helmuth, Enzyklopädisches Wörterbuch klinische Psychologie und Psychotherapie. (Stichwort:) Angsttheorien, Weinheim 1995, Beltz, S. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic scholar Klaus Berger&lt;ref name = "Berger"&gt;[http://www.faz.net/s/RubC17179D529AB4E2BBEDB095D7C41F468/Doc~E5B508C246BCD46BDBF96C6D76FDFE465~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html] Spiel's noch einmal (Play it again), Klaus Berger in der [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|FAZ]], 21. November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; accused Drewermann of using outdated ideas and research methods and of subscribing to  ancient misunderstandings of the [[Old Testament]]. A pseudo [[Marcionism]] and using of biblical and other religious texts out of context is pointed out by Protestant scholar Manfred Oeming.

The political views of Drewermann have been sharply criticized by theologians Uwe Birnstein and Klaus-Peter Lehmann as being based on a traditional German antipolitical and romantic view and reducing all social aspects to individual fear and personal understanding and goodwill.&lt;ref name ="Birnstein"&gt;Uwe Birnstein / Klaus-Peter Lehmann: Phänomen Drewermann. Politik und Religion einer Kultfigur, Eichborn Frankfurt am Main 1998 {{ISBN|3-8218-0457-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Neuhaus, in his comparison of the Political Theology of Johannes Baptist Metz and the theology of Drewermann, counters that Drewermann's theology is imminently social in its critique and does not share in antipolitical or romantic views of politics.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Neuhaus: Erinnerung als Brückenkategorie: Anstöße zur Vermittlung zwischen der Politischen Theologie von Johann Baptist Metz und der Tiefenpsychologischen Theologie Eugen Drewermann. LIT Verlag, Münster 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henryk M. Broder]] referred to Drewermann and other German intellectuals as reason for a book,&lt;ref&gt;Henryk M. Broder: ''Kein Krieg, nirgends: Die Deutschen und der Terror''. Berlin Verlag 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he denounces Drewermann and others as underplaying the role of Islamic terrorism and putting the blame solely on the west, especially Israel and the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/debatte/0,1518,187901,00.html] Broder statements about Drewermann in the German Spiegel 26 March 2002, Broders Book about [[September 11 attacks|11 September]], The selection of the unpalatable (Die Auslese von Ungenießbarem, In German), by Michael Krechting
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josef Isensee]], a Catholic German lawyer and specialist for Constitutional law, sees in Drewermann the prototype of a self-proclaimed church critic using strong opinions to gain profile and public awareness and profiting on the very organizational body he was member for the most time of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Josef Isensee, [https://www.erzbistum-koeln.de/export/sites/erzbistum/bildung/schule-hochschule/beratung_aufsicht/religionspaedagogik/ru/Isensee.pdf Die Zukunftsfähigkeit des deutschen Staatskirchenrechts - Gegenwärtige Legitimationsprobleme (The future of the German  state church law and ongoing problems of legitimization)]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in Isensee/Rees/ Rüfner Hrsg., Dem Staat, was des Staates - der Kirche, was der Kirche ist (Unto the State the things which are the State's, and unto the Church the things that are the Church's), Berlin 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12255">{{Priesthoods of ancient Rome}}
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], the '''Flamen Quirinalis''' was the [[flamen]] or high priest of the god [[Quirinus]]. He was one of the three ''flamines maiores'', third in order of importance after the [[Flamen Dialis]] and the [[Flamen Martialis]]. Like the other two high priests, he was subject to numerous ritual taboos, such as not being allowed to touch metal, ride a horse, or spend the night outside Rome.

The theology of Quirinus is complex and difficult to interpret. From early times, he was identified with the deified [[Romulus]], who originally seems to have shared some common theological and mythological elements with Quirinus.

==Ritual functions==
The ''flamen Quirinalis'' presided over at least three festivals, the [[Consualia]] Aestiva on August 21, [[Robigalia]] on April 25, and [[Larentalia]] on December 23.

These festivals were all devoted to the cult of deities of remarkable antiquity: [[Consus]] has been described as the god of the stored grains (from ''condere'', to store grains in an underground barn or silos).&lt;ref&gt;This interpretation has been recently challenged by G. Capdeville as not grounded in ancient documents. Moreover the Romans did not use to store grains in underground barns or siloses. See article Consus for detailed discussion.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robigus]] was an evil spirit that could cause mildew and thus damage growing wheat. [[Larenta]] was a figure connected to the primordial legendary times of Rome or to the founding of the city itself.

During the ''Consualia Aestiva'' the flamen Quirinalis and the [[Vestals]] offered a sacrifice at Consus's underground altar in the [[Circus Maximus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''De Spectaculis''  V  7&lt;/ref&gt;  Four days later the Vestals took part in the rites of the festival of [[Ops]], goddess of agricultural plenty, the [[Opiconsivia]]. This occasion was related to Consus too and was performed in the [[Regia]] of the forum, where Ops had a very sacred chapel, open only to the [[pontifex maximus]] and the Vestals.&lt;ref&gt;Varro  ''Lingua Latina'' VI 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The Robigalia of April 25 required the sacrificial offering of blood and entrails from a puppy, and perhaps also the entrails of a sheep. The rite took place near the fifth milestone of the [[Via Claudia]].&lt;ref&gt;Calendar of Praeneste, ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'' CIL I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; pp. 316-317.&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid talks of a ''lucus'' (grove) on the site and reports a long prayer he says was pronounced by the flamen Quirinalis. While the prayer may contain elements from an actual formulation, Ovid's text is a poetic recreation.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid  ''Fasti'' IV 905-942; prayer 910 sqq. For further discussion, see [[Robigalia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Larentalia of December 23 were a ''[[parentatio]]'', an act of [[funerary cult]] in memory of [[Larunda]] or [[Acca Larentia|Larentia]]. A sacrifice was offered at the site of  her supposed tomb on the [[Velabrum]]. She was not a goddess but a sort of heroine, with two conflicting legends:  in the first (and probably elder one) [[Acca Larentia|Larentia]] is a [[courtesan]] who had become fabulously rich after spending a night in the sanctuary of Heracles. Later she had bestowed her fortune on the Roman people on the condition that a rite named after her were held yearly. In the second she is Romulus and Remus's [[wet nurse]], also considered the mother of the [[Fratres Arvales]] and a she wolf.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius. ''Noctes Atticae'' VII  7, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gellius]] in a detailed passage on Larentia makes a specific reference to the ''flamen Quirinalis''.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius ''above'' VII 7, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Macrobius]] makes reference to the presence of an unnamed flamen, "per flaminem".&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 10, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This flamen could neither be the Dialis nor the Martialis, let alone the minores, given the nature of ''parentatio'' (funeral rite) of the festival.

Beside these festivals that of ''Quirinus'' himself, the [[Quirinalia]], would logically and probably require the participation of the ''flamen Quirinalis''. The ''Quirinalia'' were held on February 17 and must be among the oldest Roman yearly festivals.

==Quirinalia==
{{main|Quirinalia}}
The [[Quirinalia]] occurred on [[February 17]] in the [[Roman calendar]] (''{{lang|la|a.d. XIII Kal. Mart.}}'').

Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;H. Wagenvoort  ''Studies in Roman literature, culture and religion'' 1956&lt;/ref&gt; connect the Quirinalia with the anniversary date of the murder of Romulus by his subjects on the basis of the calendar of [[Polemius Silvius]] and of Ovid,&lt;ref&gt;Ovid  ''Fasti'' II 481-512&lt;/ref&gt; where the story of Romulus's apotheosis is related, and accordingly interpret the festival as a funerary ''parentatio''.

Dumezil on the other hand&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil  ''La religion romaine archaique'' Paris, 1974, part I, chap. 2&lt;/ref&gt; remarks that in all other sources the date of this event is July 7 ([[Nonae Caprotinae]]). Neither there is any record of such a ritual in ancient sources.

He puts forward another interpretation based on the fact that the only religious ritual recorded for that day are the ''stultorum feriae'', i.e. the last day of the [[Fornacalia]]. This festival used to be celebrated separately by each of the thirty ''curiae''. Therefore the Fornacalia had no fixed date and were not mentioned on calendars. Every year the ''[[curio maximus]]'' established the days for each [[curia]]. However those who had missed their day (''stulti'', fool ones) were allowed an extra off day to make amends collectively. [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]]&lt;ref&gt;Festus p.412 L2nd.&lt;/ref&gt; and Plutarch&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch ''Questiones Romanae'' 89.&lt;/ref&gt; state that the ''stultorum feriae'' were in fact the ''Quirinalia''.
Their assertion seems acceptable to Dumézil for two reasons:

1) if it were not so then no Roman writer gave any indication of their content. This is highly unlikely for in Rome religious rituals often survived their theological justification.

2) the ''stultorum feriae'' bring to an end the organised operation of the ''curiae'' in the ''Fornacalia'' and this is a guarantee of their antiquity.

The connection hypothesised by Dumezil between the ''flamen Quirinalis'' and an activity regulated  through  the ''curiae'' is important as it supports the interpretation of ''Quirinus'' as a god of the Roman civil society. The ''curiae'' were in fact the original smallest grouping of Roman society.

The most probable etymology of ''curia'' is considered by many scholars,&lt;ref&gt;P. Kretschmer "Lateinisch quirites und  quiritare" in ''Glotta''  '''10''' 1920 p. 147-157: E. Benveniste "Symbolisme social dans les cultes gréco-italiques" in ''Revue de l'histoire des religions''  '''129''' 1945 p. 7-9; A. Carandini ''Cercando Quirino'' Turin, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; to be rooted in *co-viria and that of ''quirites'' in *co-virites.

The [[Virites]] were goddesses worshipped along with Quirinus:  Gellius,&lt;ref&gt;A. Gellius ''Noctes Atticae''  XIII, 2, 3, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  writes to have read in the [[pontificales libri]], that [[dea Hora]] and Virites were invoked in prayers in  association with the god. The Virites, Quirinus's female [[paredrae]], must be the expression of the god's ''virtus'', in the case of Quirinus namely the personification of the individuals composing Roman society as citizens, in the same way as e.g. [[Nerio]], Mars's paredra, must be the personification of military prowess.

Hence Quirinus would be the Roman homologous of the correspondent last component god of the supreme divine triad among all Italic peoples, such as the [[Vofionus]] of the [[Iguvine Tables]], whose name too has been interpreted as a term meaning ''the increaser of the people'' (either from Loifer, or from Luther, an abbreviation from Greek Eleutheros) or simply  ''the people'', related to German Leute. This hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that the two first god names at Iguvium are identical to their Roman counterpart (Jov- and Mart-) and grammatically were nouns, whereas name Vofiono- is an adjectival derivation in ''no-'' of a noun root, just as *Co-virino. Moreover philologists Vittor Pisani and Emile Benveniste have proposed a likely etymology for Vofiono- that makes it the equivalent in meaning of *Co-virino: Leudhyo-no.&lt;ref&gt;Phonetic correspondences l, eu, dh &gt; u, o, f are perfectly regular for [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]]. Compare ‘''leudhyo''’ to [[German language|German]] ‘''Leute''’.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pisani, V. (1938). Mytho-Etymologica, ''Rev. des etudes Indo-Europeennes'', '''''1'''''. Bucarest.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Benveniste. (1945). Symbolisme social dans les cultes greco-italique, 129. ''Rev.d'Histoire des Religions''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to Dumezil's Trifunctional Hypothesis==
The Consualia, Robigalia, Larentalia, and the last act of Fornacalia (the Quirinalia) are the religious rituals performed by '''flamen Quirinalis'''. If Romans' traditions were conserved, rather than re-adapted, these rituals should reflect the most ancient and original nature of god Quirinus. The festivals connect him to wheat at the three important and potentially risky stages of its growth, storing, and preservation. Quirinus is thus concerned with a staple food. He cooperates with god [[Consus]], as is testified by the role of his flamen in the Consualia, to the aim of assuring the nurture of the Roman people.

There is also a connection between the function of the flamen Quirinalis in the Quirinalia and the functioning of organized Roman society as expressed through the role played by the ''curiae'' in the Fornacalia. The ''curiae'' were in fact the smallest cell of ancient Roman society.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil. ''La religion romaine archaique'', Paris, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Carandini. ''Cercando Quirino'' Turin, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the flamen Quirinalis in the Larentalia is also significant. In the two legends concerning Larentia she is a figure related to nurture, agricultural plenty, and wealth. She rears the divine twins, is the mother of the Fratres Arvales, performers of the agricultural propitiary rite of the [[Ambarvalia]], and bestows wealth on her heirs and figurative children. Her story hints to the link of sexual pleasure and wealth. In the interpretation of [[Dumézil]] this has to do with the [[Indo-European religion|Indo-European myth]] of the [[divine twins]], but Romulus's connections to kingship and war are not necessarily part of the original conception of Quirinus.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil ''La religion romaine archaique'' Paris, 1974, part I, chap.2&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Dumezil]] the theological character of the god as reflected in the functions of his flamen is thence civil and social, being related to nurture, fertility, plenty, wealth, and pleasure. This features make him the chief of all the gods of what he defines as the ''[[Trifunctional hypothesis|third function]]'' in Indo-European religions.

==Brelich's identification of Romulus with Quirinus as a mythical archetype of primitive religion==
Italo-Hungarian religious historian Angelo Brelich advanced a hypothesis that could bring together all of the poorly understood elements of the religious traditions concerning Romulus and Quirinus. He argues it is not likely that the two figures were merged at a later stage in the development of the legend, but they were in fact one since the most ancient times. This view allows us to understand why the Fornacalia, the feast of the toasting of spelt, were also one of the traditional dates of the murder of Romulus: according to this tradition the king was killed by the ''patres'', his body dismembered and each bit of it buried within their own plots of land. Brelich sees in this episode a clear reflection of a mythical theme found in primitive religion and known as the [[Dema deity]] archetype (from the character of [[Hainuwele]] in [[Melanesian religion]] first described by German ethnologist [[Adolf Ellegard Jensen]]). In such a pattern a founder hero is murdered and dismembered, his corpse turning into the staple food of his own ethnos.&lt;ref&gt;"Quirinus: una divinita' romana alla luce della comparazione storica" in ''Studi e Materiali di Storia delle Religioni''1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foundation for a Drug-Free World''' ('''FDFW''') is a nonprofit organization based in Los Angeles, California, with a focus on the elimination of drug and alcohol abuse and its resulting criminality. Founded in October 2006, it is a division of the [[Church of Scientology]]. There has been controversy about the claims made by the foundation and about its support by public organizations who were not aware of its link to Scientology.&lt;ref name="tdb2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ic2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daly|first1=Greg|title=Schools urged to be vigilant amid reports of targeting by ‘cult’|url=http://irishcatholic.ie/article/schools-urged-be-vigilant-amid-reports-targeting-%E2%80%98cult%E2%80%99|website=The Irish Catholic|accessdate=18 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404120546/http://www.irishcatholic.ie/article/schools-urged-be-vigilant-amid-reports-targeting-%E2%80%98cult%E2%80%99|archive-date=2017-04-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="db2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haglage|first1=Abby|title=Scientology Defends Its Anti-Weed Hokum|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/30/scientology-and-d-a-r-e-are-coming-for-your-kids.html|website=Daily Beast|accessdate=15 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416125258/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/30/scientology-and-d-a-r-e-are-coming-for-your-kids.html|archive-date=2017-04-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ibt2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mintz|first1=Zoe|title=Parents Outraged After Scientology-Sponsored Group Delivers Anti-Drug Messages At New York City Schools|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/parents-outraged-after-scientology-sponsored-group-delivers-anti-drug-messages-new-1799248|website=International Business Times|accessdate=15 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416125722/http://www.ibtimes.com/parents-outraged-after-scientology-sponsored-group-delivers-anti-drug-messages-new-1799248|archive-date=2017-04-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program has been accused of scaremongering by health care professionals, for claims such as [[cocaine]] [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] can cause severe depression which can lead to the addict committing murder.&lt;ref name=tdb2017/&gt;

==Relation to Scientology and Narconon==
In 2012, the police department of Santa Ana distributed anti-drug pamphlets provided by the Foundation for a Drug-Free World.  A reporter called the contact number on the pamphlets and asked where to get help for drug abuse.  He was directed to [[Narconon]] Arrowhead, the flagship rehab centre of Narconon International, which is classified as a Scientology related entity by the IRS. The SAPD withdrew the pamphlets after the reported link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dulaney |first1=Josh |title=Anti-drug Pamphlets Linked to Scientology Gone From Santa Ana Police Department |url=https://www.ocweekly.com/anti-drug-pamphlets-linked-to-scientology-gone-from-santa-ana-police-department-6475690/ |website=Orange County Weekly |accessdate=14 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181014183039/https://www.ocweekly.com/anti-drug-pamphlets-linked-to-scientology-gone-from-santa-ana-police-department-6475690/ |archive-date=2018-10-14 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Drug-Free Marshal" program started in November, 2008, at [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]].  The Foundation for a Drug-Free World supplied the pamphlets, at the bottom of which contained a notice of copyright by Foundation for a Drug-Free World, Narconon and [[Association for Better Living and Education]], all programs sponsored by the Church of Scientology. After the city mayor found out that the anti-drug program was created and bankrolled by the Church of Scientology, he apologized and ended the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://newsok.com/article/feed/27807 |title={title} |access-date=2017-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325200215/http://newsok.com/article/feed/27807 |archive-date=2017-03-25 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an investigation by the State of California into the Narconon anti-drug education program, State Superintendent [[Jack O'Connell (politician)|Jack O'Connell]] urged all California schools to drop the program for its inaccurate and unscientific information&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Rejection of diversity of opinion as applied to these established "fundamentals" and their accepted interpretation within the group often results from this tendency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ntpu.edu.tw/social/upload/P_1020081127150648.pdf |title= Archived copy |accessdate= 2014-04-06 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130817003534/http://www.ntpu.edu.tw/social/upload/P_1020081127150648.pdf |archivedate= August 17, 2013 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending upon the context, the label "fundamentalism" can be a [[pejorative]] rather than a neutral [[characterization]], similar to the ways that calling political perspectives "right-wing" or "left-wing" can - for some - have negative connotations.&lt;ref&gt;

 |quote = Widely used as a pejorative term to designate one's fanatical opponents – usually religious and/or political – rather than oneself, fundamentalism began in Christian Protestant circles in the eC20. Originally restricted to debates within evangelical ('gospel-based') Protestantism, it is now employed to refer to any person or group that is characterized as unbending, rigorous, intolerant, and militant. The term has two usages, the prior one a positive self-description, which then developed into the later derogatory usage that is now widespread.

Buddhist fundamentalism has also targeted other religious and ethnic groups, such as that in [[Myanmar]]. As a Buddhist dominated nation, Myanmar has seen recent [[Persecution of Muslims in Burma|tensions between Muslim minorities and the Buddhist majority]], especially during the [[2013 Burma anti-Muslim riots]], alleged {{by whom|date=November 2014}} to have been instigated by hardliner groups such as the [[969 Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/archives/30965 |date=March 30, 2013 |author=KYAW ZWA MOE |title=Root Out the Source of Meikhtila Unrest |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827232539/http://www.irrawaddy.org/archives/30965 |archivedate=August 27, 2013 |accessdate=November 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also that in [[Sri Lanka]]. As a Buddhist dominated nation, Sri Lanka has seen recent tensions between Muslim minorities and the Buddhist majority, especially during the 2014 [[2014 anti-Muslim riots in Sri Lanka]] &lt;ref&gt;{{https://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/19/world/asia/sri-lanka-muslim-aluthgama}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[2018 anti-Muslim riots in Sri Lanka]]&lt;ref&gt;{{http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43305453}}&lt;/ref&gt; alleged to have been instigated by hardliner groups such as the {Mahasen Balakaya} and [[Bodu Bala Sena]]. 

There are historic and contemporary examples of Buddhist fundamentalism in each of the three main branches of Buddhism: [[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]]. In Japan, a prominent example has been the practice of [[shakubuku]] among some members of the [[Nichiren]] sect—a method of proselytizing involving strident condemnation of other sects as deficient or evil.

===Christian===
{{Main article|Christian fundamentalism}} 
Christian fundamentalism has been defined by [[George Marsden]] as the demand for a strict adherence to certain theological doctrines, in reaction against  [[Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy|Modernist theology]].&lt;ref&gt;George M. Marsden, ''Fundamentalism and American Culture'', (1980) pp 4-5 Over 1400 scholarly books have cited Marsden's work, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=marsden+fundamentalism&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C27&amp;as_sdtp= according to Google Scholar].&lt;/ref&gt; The term was originally coined by its supporters to describe what they claimed were five specific classic theological beliefs of Christianity, and that developed into a [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist movement]] within the Protestant community of the United States in the early part of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Buescher, John. "[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24092 A History of Fundamentalism]", [http://www.teachinghistory.org ''Teachinghistory.org'']. Retrieved August 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamentalism as a movement arose in the United States, starting among [[conservative]] [[Presbyterian]] theologians at [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] in the late 19th century. It soon spread to conservatives among the [[Baptists]] and other denominations around 1910 to 1920. The movement's purpose was to reaffirm key theological tenets and defend them against the challenges of [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]] and [[higher criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Noll, ''A History of Christianity in the United States and Canada'' (1992) pp 376-86&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "fundamentalism" has roots in the [[Niagara Bible Conference]] (1878–1897), which defined those tenets it considered ''fundamental'' to Christian belief. The term was prefigured by ''[[The Fundamentals]]'', a collection of twelve books on five subjects published in 1910 and funded by the brothers Milton and [[Lyman Stewart]], but coined by Curtis Lee Lawes, editor of ''The Watchman-Examiner'', who proposed in the wake of the 1920 pre-convention meeting of the Northern Baptist Convention (now the [[American Baptist Churches USA]]) that those fighting for the fundamentals of the faith be called "fundamentalists."&lt;ref&gt;Curtis Lee Laws, "Convention Side Lights," The Watchman-Examiner, 8, no. 27 (1 July 1920), p 834.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Fundamentals'' came to represent a ''[[Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy]]'' that appeared late in the 19th century within some Protestant denominations in the United States, and continued in earnest through the 1920s. The first formulation of American fundamentalist beliefs traces to the Niagara Bible Conference and, in 1910, to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, which distilled these into what became known as the ''five fundamentals'':&lt;ref&gt;George M. Marsden, "Fundamentalism and American Culture", (1980) p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Biblical inspiration]] and the [[Biblical infallibility|infallibility of scripture]]  as a result of this
* [[Virgin birth of Jesus]]
* Belief that Christ's death was the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] for sin
* Bodily [[resurrection of Jesus]]
* Historical reality of the [[miracles of Jesus]]
It did ''not'' (yet) become associated with tenets such as [[Young Earth creationism]].

By the late 1910s, theological conservatives rallying around the five fundamentals came to be known as "fundamentalists". They reject the existence of commonalities with theologically related religious traditions, such as the grouping of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism into one Abrahamic family of religions.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; In contrast, Evangelical groups (such as the [[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association]]), while they typically agree on the theology "fundamentals" as expressed in ''The Fundamentals'', are often willing to participate in events with religious groups who do not hold to the essential doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, ''Revive us Again'' (1997) p 200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic===
{{Main article|Islamic fundamentalism}}
[[Extremism]] within Islam goes back to the 7th century to the time of the [[Kharijites]]. From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shia Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to [[Takfir]], whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/another-battle-with-islams-true-believers/article20802390/|title=Another battle with Islam's 'true believers'|work=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/fruits-of-the-tree-of-extremism|title=Imam Mohamad Jebara: Fruits of the tree of extremism|author=Mohamad Jebara More Mohamad Jebara|work=Ottawa Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hasan-balance-2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802045255/http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |archivedate=August 2, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shia]] and [[Sunni]] religious conflicts since the 7th century created an opening for radical ideologues, such as [[Ali Shariati]] (1933–77), to merge social revolution with Islamic fundamentalism, as exemplified by the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;William E. Griffith, "The Revival of Islamic Fundamentalism: The Case of Iran", ''International Security,'' June 1979, Vol. 4 Issue 1, pp 132-138 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2626789 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic fundamentalism has appeared in many countries;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Davidson, ''Islamic Fundamentalism'' (Greenwood, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Wahhabi]] version is promoted worldwide and financed by [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Qatar]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Natana DeLong-Bas, ''Wahhabi Islam: From Revival and Reform to Global Jihad'' (Oxford University Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindijer|first1=Koert|title=How Islam from the north spreads once more into the Sahel|url=http://theafricanists.info/how-islam-from-the-north-spreads-once-more-into-the-sahel/|website=The Africanists|accessdate=24 November 2014|date=24 August 2013|quote=Hundreds of years later, Islam again comes to the Sahel, this time with an unstoppable mission mentality and the way paved by money from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Pakistan.

The [[Iran hostage crisis]] of 1979–80 marked a major turning point in the use of the term "fundamentalism". The media, in an attempt to explain the ideology of [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] and the [[Iranian Revolution]] to a Western audience described it as a "fundamentalist version of Islam" by way of analogy to the Christian fundamentalist movement in the U.S. Thus was born the term ''Islamic fundamentalist'', which became a common use of the term in following years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/archivesearch?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;tab=wn&amp;q=Islamic+fundamentalist&amp;scoring=n&amp;sa=N&amp;sugg=d&amp;as_ldate=1990&amp;as_hdate=1991&amp;lnav=d4&amp;hdrange=1992,2005|title=Google News Search: Chart shows spikes in '79 (Iran hostage crisis), after 9/11 and in '92 and '93 (Algerian elections, PLO).|accessdate=December 9, 2008}}{{original research?|date = November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pagan===
{{Further|Esoteric Nazism|Neo-völkisch movements|Heathenry (new religious movement)|Viking revival}}
As defined by Goodrick-Clarke, Nordic racial paganism is synonymous with the [[Odinist]] movement (including some who identify as [[Wotansvolk]]). He describes it as a "spiritual rediscovery of the Aryan ancestral gods...intended to embed the white races in a sacred worldview that supports their tribal feeling", and expressed in "imaginative forms of ritual magic and ceremonial forms of fraternal fellowship".&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 257.&lt;/ref&gt; The mainline Odinist, Asatruar and Germanic Neo-Pagan community does not hold any racist, Nazi, extreme right-wing or racial supremacist beliefs, and most Neo-Pagan groups reject racism and Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heathensagainsthate.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715152917/http://www.heathensagainsthate.org/ |archivedate=15 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wy/wyrd/antinazi.html |title=Ásatrú is not Nazi |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wy/wyrd/odinvsnazi.html |title=Odinism vs Nazism |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of research by [[Mattias Gardell]],&lt;ref&gt;Subsequently published in Gardell's ''Gods of the Blood''.&lt;/ref&gt; Goodrick-Clarke traces the original conception of the Odinist religion by [[Alexander Rud Mills]] in the 1920s, and its modern revival by [[Else Christensen]] and her [[Odinist Fellowship (United States)|Odinist Fellowship]] from 1969 onwards. Christensen's politics were left-wing, deriving from [[anarcho-syndicalism]], but she believed that leftist ideas had a formative influence on both Italian Fascism and German National-Socialism, whose totalitarian perversions were a betrayal of these movements' socialist roots. Elements of a leftist and libertarian racial-socialism could therefore be reclaimed from the fascism in which they had become encrusted.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 261.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Christensen was also convinced that the diseases of Western culture demanded a spiritual remedy. Mills' almost-forgotten writings inspired her with a programme for re-connecting with the gods and goddesses of the old Norse and Germanic pantheons, which she identified with the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] in [[Carl Jung]]'s concept of the racial [[collective unconscious]]. According to Christensen, therefore, Odinism is organically related to race in that "its principles are encoded in our genes".&lt;ref&gt;Christensen 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ásatrú]] movement as practiced by [[Stephen McNallen]] differed from Christensen's Odinist Fellowship in placing a greater emphasis on ritual and a lesser focus on racial ideology. In 1987, McNallen's [[Asatru Free Assembly]] collapsed from prolonged internal tensions arising from his repudiation of Nazi sympathizers within the organization. A group of these, including [[Wyatt Kaldenberg]], then joined the Odinist Fellowship (as its [[Los Angeles]] chapter) and formed an association with [[Tom Metzger (white supremacist)|Tom Metzger]], which led to a further rebuff since "Else Christensen thought Metzger too racist, and members of the Arizona Kindred also wanted the Fellowship to be pro-white but not hostile to colored races and Jews".&lt;ref name="GC262"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 262.&lt;/ref&gt; A series of defections from both of the main US-based organizations created secessionist groups with more radical agendas, among them Kaldenberg's ''Pagan Revival'' network and [[Jost Turner]]'s ''[[National Socialist Kindred]]''.&lt;ref name="GC262"/&gt;

Kaplan and Weinberg note that "the religious component of the Euro-American radical right subculture includes both pagan and Christian or pseudo-Christian elements," locating Satanist or Odinist Nazi Skinhead sects in the United States ([[Ben Klassen]]'s atheistic [[Creativity (religion)|Creativity Movement]]), Britain ([[David Myatt]]), Germany, Scandinavia and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan and Weinberg 1998: 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, some [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] groups and terrorists&amp;mdash;including several with neo-fascist or neo-Nazi leanings&amp;mdash;have built their ideologies around pagan religious imagery, including Odinism or Wotanism. One such group is the [[White Order of Thule]].&lt;ref&gt;Berlet and Vysotsky 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Founding members of [[The Order (white supremacist group)|the Order]] were Wotanists (a racial form of Odinism).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps3578/www.fbi.gov/library/megiddo/megiddo.pdf|title=Project Megiddo|last=Federal Bureau of Investigations|first=|date=1999|website=United States Government Publishing Office|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anders Behring Breivik|Anders Brievik]], a Norwegian terrorist who committed the [[2011 Norway attacks|2011 Oslo attacks]], identified himself as an Odinist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dagen.no/Nyheter/hedning/Breivik-mener-Jesus-er-%C2%ABpatetisk%C2%BB-272638|title=Breivik believes Jesus is "pathetic".|last=Rognsvåg|first=Silje|date=2015|website=Dagen|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wotansvolk|Wotanism]] is another religion that has appeared in the US white supremacist movement, and also utilizes imagery derived from paganism. [[Odalism]] is a European ideology advocated by the defunct [[Heathen Front]] and the [[National Socialist Black Metal]] musician [[Varg Vikernes]].

The question of the relationship between Germanic neopaganism and the neo-Nazi movement is controversial among German neopagans, with opinions ranging across a wide spectrum. Active conflation of neo-fascist or [[far right]] ideology with paganism is present in the ''[[Artgemeinschaft]]'' and ''[[Deutsche Heidnische Front]]''. In Flanders, ''[[Werkgroep Traditie]]'' combines Germanic neopaganism with the ideology of the ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]''.

In the [[United States]], Michael J. Murray of [[Ásatrú Alliance]] (in the late 1960s an [[American Nazi Party]] member)&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan 1997; [http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=451 The New Barbarians] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227160315/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=451 |date=December 27, 2007 }} (Southern Poverty Law Center intelligence report, Winter 1998). Since the Alliance's foundation in 1988, Murray has emphasized that it "does not advocate any type of political or racial extremist views or affiliations" towards sympathizing Neo-Nazis.&lt;/ref&gt; and musician/journalist [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]] (who turned to "[[metagenetic]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.golem-net.de/Ausg13/interview.htm |title=2003 interview with the German esotericist magazine '&amp;#39;Der Golem'&amp;#39; |publisher=Golem-net.de |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518204113/http://www.golem-net.de/Ausg13/interview.htm |archivedate=18 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asatru in the mid-1990s),&lt;ref name=ESOTERRA5&gt;"Wulfing One" 1995 (interview with Michael Moynihan in ''EsoTerra'' magazine).&lt;/ref&gt; though Moynihan states that he has no political affiliations.&lt;ref name=WWLORD&gt;Zach Dundas.

Mattias Gardell claims that while older US racist groups are Christian and patriotic ([[Christian Identity]]), there is a younger generation of [[white supremacism|white supremacists]] who have rejected both  Christianity and mainstream right-wing movements.&lt;ref name="Kaplan 1997"&gt;Kaplan 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Many neo-Nazis have also left Christianity for neopaganism because of Christianity's Jewish roots, and patriotism in favour of Odinism because they view both Christianity and the United States government as responsible for what they see as the evils of a liberal society and the [[White genocide conspiracy theory|decline of the white race]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardell 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaplan claims that there is a growing interest in one form of Odinism among members of the radical racist right-wing movements.&lt;ref name="Kaplan 1997"/&gt; Berger judges that there has been an aggregation of both racist and non-racist groups under the heading of "Odinism", which has confused the discussion about neo-Nazi Neopagans, and which has led most non-racist Germanic neopagans to favour terms like "Ásatrú" or "Heathenry" over "Odinism".&lt;ref&gt;Berger 2005: 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the 1999 [[Project Megiddo]] report issued by the [[FBI]] used "Odinism" as referring to white supremacist groups exclusively, sparking protests by the [[International Asatru-Odinic Alliance]], Stephen McNallen expressing concern about a "pattern of anti-[[European-American]] actions".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/testi/FBI_007.htm CESNUR] (Center for Studies on New Religions) news release, 10 November 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Fundamentalist" has been used pejoratively to refer to philosophies perceived as literal-minded or carrying a pretense of being the sole source of objective truth, regardless of whether it is usually called a [[religion]]. For instance, the [[Archbishop of Wales]] has criticized "atheistic fundamentalism" broadly&lt;ref name="McGrath 2007"&gt;[[Alister McGrath]] and Joanna Collicutt McGrath, ''The Dawkins Delusion? Atheist Fundamentalism and the Denial of the Divine'', [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]] (SPCK), February 15, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-281-05927-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/press/display_press_release.php?prid=4542 Yr Eglwys yng Nghymru | The Church in Wales&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316070109/http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/press/display_press_release.php?prid=4542 |date=March 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7156783.stm | work=BBC News | title='Atheistic fundamentalism' fears | date=December 22, 2007 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said "Any kind of fundamentalism, be it Biblical, atheistic or Islamic, is dangerous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atheistnation.net/news/?atheist/article,00139 |title=Archbishop of Wales fears the rise of "Atheistic Fundamentalism" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227061935/http://www.atheistnation.net/news/?atheist%2Farticle%2C00139 |archivedate=December 27, 2007 |accessdate=November 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said, "the new fundamentalism of our age ... leads to the language of expulsion and exclusivity, of extremism and polarisation, and the claim that, because God is on our side, he is not on yours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7156783.stm |title=Atheistic fundamentalism" fears |publisher=BBC News |date=22 December 2007 |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New Inquisition]]'', [[Robert Anton Wilson]] lampoons the members of skeptical organizations such as the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]] as fundamentalist materialists, alleging that they dogmatically dismiss any evidence that conflicts with [[materialism]] as hallucination or fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Pope [[Robert Anton Wilson]], ''[[The New Inquisition]]: Irrational Rationalism and the Citadel of Science''. 1986. 240 pages. {{ISBN|1-56184-002-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the imposition of restrictions on the wearing of headscarves in state-run schools has been labeled "secular fundamentalism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2003/12/19/edscarf_ed3_.php "Secular fundamentalism"], [[International Herald Tribune]], December 19, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3405453.stm "Headscarf ban sparks new protests,"] [[BBC News]], January 17, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, private or cultural intolerance of women wearing the [[hijab]] (Islamic headcovering) and political activism by Muslims also has been labeled "secular fundamentalism" by some Muslims in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Ayesha Ahmad, [http://www.islamawareness.net/Secularism/activists.html "Muslim Activists Reject Secular Fundamentalism"], originally published at [[IslamOnline]], April 22, 1999.

The term "fundamentalism" is sometimes applied to signify a counter-cultural fidelity to a principle or set of principles, as in the pejorative term "[[market fundamentalism]]", used to imply exaggerated religious-like faith in the ability of unfettered ''[[laissez-faire]]'' or [[free market]] economic views or policies to solve economic and social problems. According to economist [[John Quiggin]], the standard features of "economic fundamentalist rhetoric" are "dogmatic" assertions and the claim that anyone who holds contrary views is not a real economist. Retired professor in religious studies Roderick Hindery lists positive qualities attributed to political, economic, or other forms of cultural fundamentalism, including "vitality, enthusiasm, willingness to back up words with actions, and the avoidance of facile compromise," as well as negative aspects, such as psychological attitudes,{{which|date = November 2014}} occasionally elitist and pessimistic perspectives, and, in some cases, literalism.&lt;ref&gt;Hindery, Roderick (2008). [http://propagandaandcriticalthought.com/RHComparativeEthicsArticle2008.htm "Comparative Ethics, Ideologies, and Critical Thought"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128013058/http://propagandaandcriticalthought.com/RHComparativeEthicsArticle2008.htm |date=January 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, the Anglican [[Archbishop of Wales]] [[Barry Morgan]] criticized what he referred to as "atheistic fundamentalism", claiming that it advocated that religion has no substance and "that faith has no value and is superstitious nonsense."&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; He claimed it led to situations such as councils calling Christmas "[[Winterval]]", schools refusing to put on [[nativity play]]s and [[cross]]es removed from chapels.  Others have countered that some of these attacks on Christmas are [[urban legend]]s, not all schools do nativity plays because they choose to perform other traditional plays like [[A Christmas Carol]] or [[The Snow Queen]] and, because of rising tensions between various religions, opening up public spaces to alternate displays rather than the [[Nativity scene]] is an attempt to keep government religion-neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/christmas2007/story/0,,2230951,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Sorry to disappoint, but it's nonsense to suggest we want to ban Christmas | first=Polly | last=Toynbee | date=December 21, 2007 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Sociology of religion|Sociologist of religion]]
[[Tex Sample]] asserts that it is a mistake to refer to a [[Muslim]], [[Jewish]], or [[Christian]] fundamentalist. Rather, a fundamentalist's fundamentalism is their primary concern, over and above other denominational or faith considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Tex Sample. Public Lecture, Faith and Reason Conference, San Antonio, TX. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism by [[Elliot N. Dorff]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to carry out the fundamentalist program in practice, one would need a perfect understanding of the ancient language of the original text, if indeed the true text can be discerned from among variants. Furthermore, human beings are the ones who transmit this understanding between generations. Even if one wanted to follow the literal word of God, the need for people first to understand that word necessitates human interpretation. Through that process human fallibility is inextricably mixed into the very meaning of the divine word. As a result, it is impossible to follow the indisputable word of God; one can only achieve a human understanding of God's will.&lt;ref&gt;Dorff, Elliot N. and Rosett, Arthur, A Living Tree; The Roots and Growth of Jewish Law, SUNY Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Howard Thurman]] was interviewed in the late 1970s for a BBC feature on religion. He told the interviewer:
{{quote|I say that creeds, dogmas, and theologies are inventions of the mind. It is the nature of the mind to make sense out of experience, to reduce the conglomerates of experience to units of comprehension which we call principles, or ideologies, or concepts. Religious experience is dynamic, fluid, effervescent, yeasty. But the mind can't handle these so it has to imprison religious experience in some way, get it bottled up. Then, when the experience quiets down, the mind draws a bead on it and extracts concepts, notions, dogmas, so that religious experience can make sense to the mind. Meanwhile religious experience goes on experiencing, so that by the time I get my dogma stated so that I can think about it, the religious experience becomes an object of thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/jul1981/v38-2-criticscorner1.htm "An Interview With Howard Thurman and Ronald Eyre"], ''Theology Today'', Volume 38, Issue 2 (July 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Influential criticisms of fundamentalism include [[James Barr (biblical scholar)|James Barr]]'s books on Christian fundamentalism and [[Bassam Tibi]]'s analysis of Islamic fundamentalism.

Political usage of the term "fundamentalism" has also been criticized. "Fundamentalism" has been used by political groups to attack their opponents, using the term flexibly depending on their political interests. According to Judith Nagata, a professor of Asia Research Institute in the [[National University of Singapore]], "The Afghan ''mujahiddin'', locked in combat with the Soviet enemy in the 1980s, could be praised as 'freedom fighters' by their American backers at the time, while the present Taliban, viewed, among other things, as protectors of American enemy Osama bin Laden, are unequivocally 'fundamentalist'."&lt;ref&gt;Nagata, Judith. 2001. ''Toward an Anthropology of "Fundamentalism."'' Toronto: Blackwell Publishing, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study at the [[University of Edinburgh]] found that of its six measured dimensions of religiosity, "lower intelligence is most associated with higher levels of fundamentalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The relationship between intelligence and multiple domains of religious belief: Evidence from a large adult US sample |author=Gary J. Lewis, Stuart J. Ritchie, [[Timothy C. Bates]] |url=http://www.midus.wisc.edu/findings/pdfs/1197.pdf|date=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The [[Associated Press]]' ''[[AP Stylebook]]'' recommends that the term fundamentalist not be used for any group that does not apply the term to itself. Many scholars have adopted a similar position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vcstar.com/news/2011/may/12/can-anyone-define-fundamentalist/ "Can anyone define 'fundamentalist'?"], Terry Mattingly, ''Ventura County Star'', May 12, 2011. Retrieved August 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, however, use the term in the broader descriptive sense to refer to various groups in various religious traditions including those groups that would object to being classified as fundamentalists, such as in ''[[The Fundamentalism Project]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Marty, M. and Appleby, R.S. eds. (1993). ''Fundamentalisms and the State: Remaking Polities, Economies, and Militance''. John H. Garvey, Timur Kuran, and David C. Rapoport, associate editors, Vol 3, The Fundamentalism Project.

'''Gedimu''' ({{zh|s=格迪目|t=格迪目|p=Gédímù}}) or ''Qadim'' ({{lang-ar|قديم|}}) is the earliest school of Islam in China. It is a [[Hanafi]],&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Hanaifei xuepai {{zh|v=哈乃斐学派|short=}} -  one of the four major [[madhhab|schools]] of Islam&lt;/ref&gt; non-[[Sufi]] school of the [[Sunni]] tradition. Its supporters are centered on local mosques, which function as relatively independent units.&lt;ref&gt;Mikko Suutarinen, according to Lipman (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is numerically the largest Hui school of thought in China.&lt;ref&gt;''Cihai'', S.525, Article: 格迪目 (gédímù).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the introduction of Islam in China, during the [[Tang Dynasty]], it continued to the Ming Dynasty with no schisms.&lt;ref&gt;Cihai, S.525&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of the Ming and early [[Qing Dynasty]] [[Sufism]] was introduced to China. Muslims in what are now [[Xinjiang]], Gansu and Qinghai, began to convert to the Sufi sects, and the new sects were referred to as old teaching / New Faith / New Religion (Chinese xinpai or Xinjiao). Those who clung to the old beliefs were called members of the Gedimu (from the Arabid "qadim," meaning ancient), or in Chinese Laojiao (the old doctrine).

In the religious ideas of this school the basic Islamic principles of [[Tawheed]]&lt;ref&gt;chin ren zhu duyi 认主独一&lt;/ref&gt; are maintained.&lt;ref name="chinaculture.org"&gt;[http://www.chinaculture.org/library/2008-02/04/content_25544.htm chinaculture.org: Qadim -- the Earliest Islamic Sect in China] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116224636/http://www.chinaculture.org/library/2008-02/04/content_25544.htm |date=2011-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In religious practice, this requires of the faithful a strict observance of the principle of Rukun, the five basic duties of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;In the links of chinaculture.org referred to as "五大圣命" (''Wu da sheng ming'')&lt;/ref&gt;

In the long period of development formed a conservative tradition.&lt;ref&gt;They celebrate as the [[Mawlid an-Nabi|Celebration of the birthday of the Prophet Mohammed]] (Chinese:''Shengji'').&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt; It is against unorthodox innovations and sticks to the old rules, without interference in the affairs of other denominations.&lt;ref name="chinaculture.org"/&gt;

Another important feature of the school is that it puts a focus on culture and education. Organised by the mosques, they send the children from their neighborhood to receive religious instruction. Usually Arabic and Persian writings are studied.&lt;ref name="chinaculture.org"/&gt;

Qadim has spread the longest history in China. In its development, the school has been somewhat influenced by Chinese culture and has many [[Han Chinese]] customs and traditions included in its rites. [5]{{Clarify|date=July 2012}} The mosque architecture is different from that of other Muslim areas. Qadim was the result of the Sunni faith in a particular environment in the China proper.

[[Jingtang Jiaoyu]] is a form of Islamic education, influenced by Chinese culture, which the Gedimu Muslims pride themselves in learning. Jingtang Jiaoyu does not closely approximate arabic due to the liminations of the vernacular spoken chinese, in particular, its vowels and final consanants, it produces a sinicized pronunciation of the Arabic language. Many Hui who used it said Salaam Aleikun instead of Salaam Alaikum.

The Hanafi Sunni Gedimu has been somewhat influenced by Chinese customs and the Jingtang Jiaoyu method of education, refusing to pronounce Arabic in the Arab manner even when learning of the standard pronunciation. Hanfi Sunni Sunnaiti's ([[Yihewani]] adherents) criticize the Gedimu for practicing Islamic customs influenced by Chinese culture, including Jingtang Jiaoyu, Sunnaiti's pride themselves on speaking correct Arabic, accusing the Gedimu Muslims of practicing Han and Buddhist customs and "Chinese Arabic". One Sunnaiti Imam said of the Gedimu, "blindly followed the traditions of their ancestors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b21aKLh6_KkC&amp;pg=PA242&amp;dq=jingtang+jiaoyu+an+la+hu&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SNoPTZmBMsGclgf497SyDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=jingtang%20yingchun%20ahong&amp;f=false|title=Between Mecca and Beijing: modernization and consumption among urban Chinese Muslims|author=Maris Boyd Gillette|year=2000|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=|page=106|isbn=0-8047-3694-4|pages=|accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qadim along with the [[Yihewani|Ikhwan]]&lt;ref&gt;Of [[Ma Wanfu]] (1853-1934) From [[The Dongxiang autonomous county|Hezhou]] founded in [[Gansu]] province, cf. [http://www.chinaculture.org/library/2008-02/04/content_25494.htm chinaculture.org: Ikhwān Sect] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819015930/http://www1.chinaculture.org/library/2008-02/04/content_25494.htm |date=2011-08-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Xidaotang]]&lt;ref&gt;The so-called Chinese school of [[Ma Qixi]] (1857-1914) founded in [[Lintan]] in the province of [[Gansu]], cf. [http://www.chinaculture.org/library/2008-02/04/content_25439.htm chinaculture.org: West Khanqa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107094551/http://www.chinaculture.org/library/2008-02/04/content_25439.htm |date=2011-11-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; on the three major school traditions of China &lt;ref&gt;Zhongguo de sanda jiaopai 中国的三大教派  bzw. short: Sanda jiaopai 三大教派: Gedimu 格底目 (Qadīm), Yihewani 伊赫瓦尼 (Ikhwānī), Xidaotang 西道堂 (Chinese School).&lt;/ref&gt;

Gedimu adherents use Mosques which are built like [[Chinese temple|Chinese style temples]] with Minarets resembling [[Chinese pagoda|pagoda]]s, in contrast to Yihewani members, who build their Mosques and Minarets to resemble Middle Eastern style architecture.

Still, Gedimu has been much less influenced by Chinese culture than some Islamic other sects, such as Qadariyya and Xidaotang.

'''Terracotta figurines''' are a mode of artistic and religious expression frequently found in [[ancient Greece]]. These figurines abound and provide an invaluable testimony to the everyday life and religion of the ancient Greeks. The so-called [[Tanagra figurine]]s, in fact made elsewhere as well, are one of the most important types.

==Techniques of manufacture==

===Modelling===
[[Image:Woman hands raised Louvre AM244.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Woman with raised arms, typical funerary offering, [[Cyprus]], 7th century BC, Louvre]]

Modelling is the most common and simplest technique. It is also used for the realization of bronzes: the prototypes are made out of raw [[clay]]. The small sizes are directly worked with the hand. For the larger models, the coroplath (or {{lang|grc|κοροπλάθος}}  ''koropláthos'', manufacturer of figurines) presses the clay pellets or wads against a wooden restraint.

===Molding===
[[Image:Casting mold Louvre CA5969.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Plaster key mold for the reverse side of a figurine of [[Demeter]]-[[Isis]], Louvre]]

The mold is obtained by application of a bed of clay or plaster on the prototype. Simple molds, used by the Greeks of the continent until the 4th century BC, are simply dried. Bivalvular molds, borrowed by the insular Greeks from the Egyptians, require cutting to obtain an obverse and a reverse, with which "keys" are sometimes associated protuberances allowing the two parts to fit better. When the piece becomes complicated, with important projections (arm, legs, head, clothing), the craftsman can cut out the mold in smaller parts. The piece is then dried.

The second phase consists of applying a layer of raw clay inside the mold, which can be incised beforehand in order to obtain effects of relief. The thinness of the layer varies according to the type of object to be realized. The faces of the mold are joined together, the object is then unmolded, and the craftsman can proceed to the final improvements, typically smoothing the junction. The craftsman also creates a small opening, a vent hole that allows steam to escape during the firing. The vent can also be used for assembly, allowing intervention inside the piece. The limbs are then joined to the body either by pasting them with [[slip (ceramics)|slip]], clay mixed with water, or by mortice and tenon joint.

===Firing and completion===
The piece is then fired in the [[kiln]], with temperature ranging from 600 to 800&amp;nbsp;°C. Once the figurine is fired, a [[slip (ceramics)|slip]] can be applied. The slip is sometimes itself fired at low temperature. In the beginning, the range of colours available was rather limited: red, yellow, black and blue. From the [[Hellenistic era]] on, orange, pink mauve, and green were added to that repertoire. The pigments were natural mineral dyes: [[Red ochre|ochre]] for yellow and red, [[coal]] for black, [[malachite]] for green.

==Religious functions==
[[Image:Woman offerings Louvre S2253.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Woman bearing offerings, archaic figurine from Peloponnese, Louvre]]

Due to their low cost, figurines were widely used as religious offerings. That was their primary purpose, with the decorative aspect coming only later. This explains why the ancient Greek temples host abundant quantities of votive or funerary figurines and why there is almost no document written on their subject.

These figurines can present identification issues. These attributes make it possible to recognize a particular god in an unquestionable way, such as the bow for Artemis. Moreover, certain types of statuettes correspond to a precise form of worship related to a specific divinity. Sometimes, however, "visiting gods" complicate matters: these are figurines dedicated to a god who is not of that sanctuary. In addition, the great majority of the figurines simply represent a woman upright, without attribute. These latter figurines were offered in all sanctuaries, independently of the divinity.

The gift of figurines accompanied every moment of life. During pregnancy, future mothers had care to offer a figurine to [[Ilithyia]], goddess of [[childbirth]]: the statuette represents a woman [[Squatting position|squatting]], in full work, according to the Eastern practice. Certain statuettes include a small cavity intended to receive smaller figurines, representative of their babies. During early childhood, figurines of squatting children were given —a representation of Eastern origin, arrived in Greece via [[Rhodes]] and [[Cyprus]]. The so-called "temple boys" were thought to protect children. Similar representations are also found in tombs. These figurines are of variable size, perhaps to indicate the age of the dead child. Their habit was to bury the dead accompanied by objects of daily custom: jewels, combs, figurines for the women; weapons and [[strigil]]s for the men; figurines and toys for the children. Figurines were often voluntarily broken before being placed in the tomb.

The terracotta figurines were often purchased at the entry of the sanctuary. They were the offerings of the common people, who could not afford to dedicate more valuable objects. They were also used to replace offerings in kind, like animals or food. They were placed on the benches of the temples or close to the cult statue. They were also deposited in places of worship outdoors: [[Socrates]] recognized a sacred spring on seeing figurines on the ground (''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]'' 230B). Figurines were dedicated to ask favours from a god as well as to thank him. When the figurines were too numerous in a temple, they were thrown in a "sacred dump". In that case, they are frequently broken to avoid recovery.

==Ludic and decorative functions==
[[Image:Grotesque woman Louvre CA2295.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Grotesque: 350–300 BCE, musée du Louvre]]

From the 4th century BC, the figurines acquired a decorative function. They began to represent theatrical characters, such as [[Julius Pollux]] recounts in his ''Onomasticon'' (2nd century CE): the slave, the peasant, the nurse, the fat woman, the satyr from the [[satyr play]], etc. Figurine features might be caricatured and distorted. By the Hellenistic era, the figurines became grotesques: deformed beings with disproportionate heads, sagging breasts or prominent bellies, hunchbacks and bald men. Grotesques were a speciality of the city of [[Smyrna]], but also produced throughout the Greek world, including in [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] and [[Alexandria]].

[[Tanagra figurines]] were a mold-cast type of figurine produced from the later fourth century BCE, primarily in the [[Boeotia]]n town of [[Tanagra]]. They were coated with a liquid white slip before firing, and were sometimes painted afterwards in naturalistic tints with watercolors, such as the "Dame en Bleu" ("Lady in Blue") at the Louvre. Tanagra figures depict real women, and some men and boys, in everyday costume, with familiar accessories such as hats, wreaths or fans. They seem to have been decorative pieces for the home, used in much the same way as their modern equivalents, though unlike these they were often buried with their owners. Some character pieces&lt;ref&gt;The head and torso of an actor in comedy wearing a grotesquely grinning [[satyr]]'s mask is at the [[Musée du Louvre]].&lt;/ref&gt; may have represented stock figures from the [[New Comedy]] of [[Menander]] and other writers. Others continued an earlier tradition of molded terracotta figures used as [[cult image]]s or [[votive]] objects. Typically they were about 10 to 20 centimeters high.

Terracotta was often used for dolls and other children's toys. Examples have been found of articulated figurines or small horses, easy to manipulate for small hands. Sometimes, the nature of a figurine is difficult to determine, such as the curious bell-idols from Boeotia, which appear at the end of the 8th century BC. They were equipped with a long neck and a disproportionate body, cylindrical and lathe-shaped. The arms were atrophied and the legs mobile. The head was pierced with a hole to hang them. It is uncertain if they were toys or votive offerings.

[[File:Hellenism symbol.svg|thumb|Symbol used by Hellenism followers.]]

'''Hellenism''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Ἑλληνισμός, ''Ἑllēnismós''),  the '''Hellenic ethnic religion''' (Ἑλληνικὴ ἐθνική θρησκεία), also commonly known as '''Hellenismos,''' '''Hellenic Polytheism''', '''Dodekatheism''' (Δωδεκαθεϊσμός), or '''Olympianism''' (Ὀλυμπιανισμός), refers to various religious movements that revive or reconstruct [[Ancient Greek religion|ancient Greek religious practices]], publicly, emerging since the 1990s.

The Hellenic religion is a traditional religion and way of life, revolving around the [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek Gods]], primarily focused on the [[Twelve Olympians]], and embracing ancient Hellenic [[Value (ethics)|value]]s and [[virtue]]s. 

In 2017, Hellenism was legally recognized as a "known religion" in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wildhunt.org/2017/04/greek-paganism-legally-recognized-as-known-religion-in-greece.html |title=Hellenism legally recognized as religion in Greece |publisher=wildhunt.org |date= |accessdate=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, the members are called ''Ethnikoi'' (National).

==Groups and self-designations==
[[File:Hellen ritual (2).jpg|thumb|Ritual performed by members of the [[Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes]].]]

Dodekatheism originated in and is practiced in [[Greece]] and in other countries. Leaders of the movement claimed in 2005 that there are as many as 2,000 adherents to the Hellenic tradition in Greece, with an additional 100,000 who have "some sort of interest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/0501/abstracts/letter.html |title=Letter From Greece: The Gods Return to Olympus |publisher=Archaeology.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; No official estimates exist for devotees worldwide.

There are no official naming practices for this religion, but there does seem to be an informal naming convention, based on academically accepted descriptive definitions, adhered to by groups and most individual believers. ''Hellenism'' is the most common term, used chiefly as an identifier for the modern polytheistic religion by its adherents today but it can also refer to the ancient Greek religion and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hellenicgods.org/hellenismos|title=HELLENISMOS - ΕΛΛΗΝΙΣΜΟΣ - www.HellenicGods.org|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originally stems from a systematization and revival of Greek religion done by the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]].  Julian used the term to describe traditional religion of the Greeks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecauldron.net/dc-faq.php|title=Hellenismos FAQ (The Cauldron: A Pagan Forum)|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the word can also have other unrelated meanings in modern Greek). Additionally, subgroups use a variety of names to distinguish branches focusing on specific schools of thought, or modern traditions focusing on the public practices of individual city-states. These subgroups can be described as denominations. ''Hellenic religion'', and ''Hellenic polytheism'' can be said to be used interchangeably to refer to the religion, and are synonymous. The phrase ''Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism'' refers more to the methodology used by some practitioners to revive a version of the religion, than the religion itself. Not all Hellenic Polytheists are reconstructionists. ''Dodekatheism'' and ''Olympianism'' are other names, though less commonly used.

===In Greece===

[[File:Hellen priest (1).png|thumb|right|Priest performing ritual.]]

The first Greek organization to openly support the religious revival of Hellenic religion was Ύπατο Συμβούλιο των Ελλήνων Εθνικών ([[Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes]] or YSEE), established in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ysee.gr/index-eng.php |title=Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes |publisher=Ysee.gr |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is publicly active. YSEE is a founding member of the [[World Congress of Ethnic Religions]] (now [[European Congress of Ethnic Religions]]) and hosted the seventh annual WCER Congress in June 2004.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ysee.gr/ YSEE website]. With branches also in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Germany, their level of real world public activity, and actual membership levels, the [[Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes]] can be argued to be the defining lead organization for the public revival movement.&lt;/ref&gt; YSEE is also a member of the [[European Union]]'s action programme to combat discrimination. The organization primarily refers to the religion as the "Ethnic Polytheistic" or "genuine Hellenism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ysee.gr/index-eng.php?type=english&amp;f=organosi |title=The organizational and operating structure of the YSEE |publisher=Ysee.gr |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its practitioners as ''Ethnikoi Hellenes'', "Ethnic [National] Hellenes".

Another very active organization since its founding at 2008 is Labrys religious community. Labrys has focused primarily on the religious aspects of Hellenism or Hellenic (Greek) polytheism, avoiding anti-Christian rhetoric and politics, establishing weekly public rituals &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://labrys.gr/index.php?l=ilioditi |title=Heliodete weekly ritual |publisher=Labrys.gr |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and engaging in other aspects of practical promotion of polytheism like theater and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labrys.gr/index.php?l=attika_dionysia_09 |title=Attica Dionysia festival 2009 |publisher=Labrys.gr |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dionysia.labrys.gr/index2010.php |title=Attica Dionysia festival 2010 |publisher=Dionysia.labrys.gr |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dionysia.labrys.gr/index2011.php |title=Attica Dionysia festival 2011 |publisher=Dionysia.labrys.gr |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dionysia.labrys.gr/index2012.php |title=Attica Dionysia festival 2012 |publisher=Dionysia.labrys.gr |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dionysia.labrys.gr/index2013.php |title=Attica Dionysia festival 2013 |publisher=Dionysia.labrys.gr |date= |accessdate=2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dionysia.labrys.gr/index2014.php |title=Attica Dionysia festival 2014 |publisher=Dionysia.labrys.gr |date= |accessdate=2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/kabeiros |title=Kabeiros musical group |publisher=Myspace.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labrys has also promoted among Hellenes worldwide the need to actively practice household worship and the idea that family and community should be the starting points of religious practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://labrys.gr/index-en.php?l=oikiaki_latreia-en |title=Hellenic Household Worship |publisher=Labrys.gr |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017184000/http://labrys.gr/index-en.php?l=oikiaki_latreia-en |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The community has been organizing since 2008 the largest festival in Athens and also actively participates and supports the religious aspects of the oldest Hellenic festival in Greece, Prometheia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prometheia.wordpress.com/ |title=Prometheia |publisher=Prometheia.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is held every year on Mount Olympus.
Labrys religious community has published the book about {{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Hellenic Polytheism : Household Worship |url= |location= |publisher=Createspace |date=2014-11-20 |isbn=9781503121881 }} .

Other Greek organizations, such as [[Dodekatheon]] ({{lang|el|Δωδεκάθεον}}, ''Dōdekátheon'', Of the Twelve Gods),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwdekatheon.org |title=Δωδεκάθεον - Πύλη |publisher=Dwdekatheon.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Helliniki Hetaireia Archaiophilon (Societas Hellenica Antiquariorum), and the Thyrsos use a combination of terms interchangeably, including {{lang|grc|ἑλληνικὴ θρησκεία}} (''hellēnikē thrēskeîa'', translated as "Hellenic religion"), Hellenic polytheistic religion, and Hellenism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Aegean/7773/eea2.html |title=Societas Hellenica Antiquariorum - Helliniki Hetaireia Archaiophilon |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2014-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027121507/http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Aegean/7773/eea2.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thyrsos.gr/englishindex.html |title=Thyrsos - Hellenes Gentiles |publisher=Thyrsos.gr |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodecatheon and YSEE both use the terms "traditional", "ethnic", and "genuine" to refer to their religious practices. Greek polytheist author Vlassis Rassias has written a popular series of books on "Christian persecutions against the Hellenes," and the "Church of the Hellenes" organization goes so far as to call for the wholesale extermination of Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ifikratis |url=http://www.hellenicreligion.gr/doc_en/who-en.htm |title=Who we are - Hellenic Religion.

===Outside Greece===
{{third-party|date=March 2018}}
Outside Greece, Hellenic religious organizations began to emerge around 1998, with some individuals claiming to have been engaging in some form of traditional practice since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehouseofvines.com/2013/03/25/theres-a-reason-why-zeus-is-king-of-the-gods-and-hermes-isnt/ |title=There’s a reason why Zeus is king of the gods and Hermes isn’t - The House of Vines |work=The House of Vines |accessdate=20 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402095823/http://thehouseofvines.com/2013/03/25/theres-a-reason-why-zeus-is-king-of-the-gods-and-hermes-isnt/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the Hellenic polytheist organization ''Hellenion''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hellenion.org |title=Hellenion |publisher=Hellenion |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; also identifies its practices as "Hellenic Pagan Reconstructionism" and emphasizes historical accuracy in its mission statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hellenion.org/Mission.html |title=Mission Statement |publisher=Hellenion |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215091818/http://www.hellenion.org/Mission.html |archivedate=2015-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group uses the term "Hellenismos" ({{lang|grc|Ἑλληνισμός}}, ''Hellēnismós'') to describe the religion.  Hellenion does not provide official membership numbers to the public, but an unofficial estimate of 43 members can be determined for 2007,&lt;ref&gt; and approximately 100 members in 2017. Estimate based on annual membership dues reported in the [http://www.hellenion.org/Financial_Statements_2007.pdf Hellenion, Inc.

Another American group, ''Elaion'', uses the term "[[Dodekatheism]]" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|δώδεκα}}, ''dodeka'', "twelve" + {{lang|grc|θεϊσμός}}, ''theïsmós'', "belief in the gods") to describe their approach to the Hellenic religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elaion.org/dodekatheism.htm |title=Elaion.org |publisher=Elaion.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921150106/http://www.elaion.org/dodekatheism.htm |archivedate=2014-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; No reported numbers for current membership levels are known to exist.

Other terms in common usage by Hellenic polytheists include "Greek reconstructionism" and "Hellenic Traditionalism", but the two are not synonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neokoroi.org/religion/articles/livinghellenicreconstructionism|title=Living Hellenic Reconstructionism|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115021719/http://www.neokoroi.org/religion/articles/livinghellenicreconstructionism|archivedate=15 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, in Portuguese language, there is the website of ''RHB - Reconstrucionismo Helênico no Brasil'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helenos.com.br |title=Hellenic Reconstructionism in Brazil |publisher=Helenos.com.br |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; built since 2003 by Brazilian members of ''Hellenion'' and other international groups, such as the American ''Neokoroi''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neokoroi.org |title=Neokoroi |publisher=Neokoroi |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Greek ''Thyrsos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thyrsos.gr |title=Thrysos |publisher=Thyrsos.gr |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs and practices==
{{further|Ancient Greek religion}}
Hellenic polytheists worship the ancient Greek Gods, or the Hellenistic pantheon. Including the Olympians, nature divinities, underworld deities ([[Chthonic|chthonic gods]]) and [[hero]]es. Both physical and spiritual ancestors are honored. It is primarily a devotional or votive religion, based on the exchange of gifts (offerings) for the gods' blessings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecauldron.net/dc-tahiera.php|title=Ta Hiera (The Cauldron: A Pagan Forum)|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethical convictions of modern Hellenic polytheists are often inspired by ancient Greek [[virtue]]s such as [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], [[hospitality]], [[self-control]] and [[moderation]]. The [[Delphic maxims]], [[Tenets of Solon]], the [[Golden Verses of Pythagoras]], or even Aristotle's [[Ethics]] each function as complete moral codes that a Hellenic Polytheist may observe. Key to most ethical systems is the idea of ''kharis'' (or "[[charis]]", grace), to establish reciprocity between humanity and the gods, between individuals, and among community members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Winter|first=Sarah Kate Istra|title=KHARIS: Hellenic Polytheism Explored|publisher=CreateSpace|year=2008|page=43|isbn=978-1-4382-3192-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sequentialtart.com/article.php?id=1102|title=Sequential Tart: We Give to the Gods, They Give to Us (vol XI/iss 10/October 2008)|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another key value in Hellenic Polytheism is [[eusebeia]], often translated as ''piety''. This implies a commitment to the worship of the Hellenic gods and action to back this up.

There is no central "ecclesia" (church/assembly) or hierarchical clergy, though some groups (i.e., Hellenion) do offer training in that capacity. Individual worshipers are generally expected to perform their own rituals and learn about the religion and the gods by reference to primary and [[secondary sources]] on ancient Greek religion and through personal experience of the gods. Information gained from such personal experiences is often referred to in Hellenic groups as "UPG" (Unverified Personal Gnosis), a term borrowed from [[Ásatrú]], though now commonly used among many pagan religions.

==Reconstructionism ==
{{further|Polytheistic reconstructionism}}
In polytheism, [[Polytheistic Reconstructionism|Reconstructionism]] is a methodology which attempts to accurately base modern religious practice on culturally and historically genuine examples of ancient religious practices. The term is frequently used in the United States to differentiate between [[syncretism|syncretic]] and [[eclecticism|eclectic]] [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] movements, and those based on the [[traditions]], writings, history, and [[mythology]] of a specific ancient polytheistic culture.

In contrast to the eclectic traditions, Reconstructionists are very culturally oriented and attempt to reconstruct historical forms of religion and spirituality, in a modern context. Therefore, [[Kemetic reconstructionism|Kemetic]], Canaanite, Hellenic, [[Roman polytheistic reconstructionism|Roman]], [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism|Celtic]], [[Germanic neopaganism|Germanic]], [[Baltic neopaganism|Baltic]] and [[Slavic neopaganism|Slavic]] Reconstructionists aim for the revival of historical practices and beliefs of [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Ancient Egypt]], Ancient [[Canaanite religion|Canaan]] and Phoenicia, [[Religion in ancient Greece|Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]], the [[Celtic polytheism|Celts]], the [[Germanic Paganism|Germanic peoples]], the [[Baltic mythology|Balts]] and the [[Slavic mythology|Slavs]], respectively.

Most Hellenic polytheist groups unequivocally state that reconstructionism is not the only correct method of practicing the ancient Greek religion, but do identify a practice as Hellenic only when it embraces the [[humanistic]] values and ethical virtues of the ancient Greeks, demonstrates loyalty and reverence toward the Greek Gods, and uses a religious structure that would be recognizable to an ancient Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently asked questions about the Ethnic Hellenic religion and tradition: What do you think you will achieve by returning to the Ancient Ways in today's society? |work=Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes |url=http://www.ysee.gr/index-eng.php?type=english&amp;f=faq#4 |accessdate=September 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=On Orthopraxy |work=Hellenismos.us|url=http://hellenismos.us/?p=124  |accessdate=September 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hellenic Ethics:Living Virtues in Community |work=The Cauldron: A Pagan Forum |url=http://www.ecauldron.com/greekethics.php |accessdate=September 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920112549/http://www.ecauldron.com/greekethics.php |archivedate=September 20, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The centrality of ethics in Dodekathiesm |work=Elaion |url=http://www.elaion.org/ethics.htm |accessdate=September 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120122509/http://www.elaion.org/ethics.htm |archivedate=November 20, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups make a clear distinction between themselves and the Neopagan movement, and identify some 'Hellenic' groups as "simply disguised as 'Hellenes' for reasons that exist hidden within the depths of their own minds." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wojciech Jan Rudny interviews a constitutional member of the Supreme Council of the Ethnikoi Hellenes (YSEE) on behalf of the polish "GNIAZDO" magazine |work=YSEE |url=http://www.ysee.gr/index-eng.php?type=english&amp;f=rozmowa_en |accessdate=September 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revivalism ==
Revivalism focuses more on Hellenic Polytheism as a living, changing religion. Hellenic Revivalism allows more room for practitioners to decide what feels right to them. Most modern Hellenic Polytheists exist somewhere on a Reconstructionist to Revivalist spectrum.

==Stated continuity==
Modern Hellenic polytheist organizations are "revivalist" or "[[Polytheistic reconstructionism|reconstructionist]]" for the most part, but many adherents like Panagiotis Marinis from the group ''Dodecatheon'' in Greece, has stated that the religion of ancient Greece has survived throughout the intervening centuries, and that he, himself, was raised in a family that practiced this religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Jamil Said| title=I Still Worship Zeus|medium=DVD|publisher=Jamil Said Productions|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not they believe that the Hellenic polytheist religious tradition is continuous, there is evidence that Greek Hellenic polytheists within the modern country of Greece see the movement as an expression of Greek cultural heritage, in opposition to the [[Church of Greece|Orthodox Christianity]] that is overwhelmingly dominant.&lt;ref&gt;The periodic revival of aspects  of the religion, such as in the arts, philosophy &amp; etc is also an expression of a general European fascination with claccisism &amp; Hellenism.

==Political controversy  ==
{{Further|Discrimination against Neopagans}}
 
The [[2004 Summer Olympics]] stirred up several disputes concerning Hellenic polytheistic religion.
* Professor Giorgos Dontas, president of the [[Archaeological Society of Athens]] expressed public outrage at the destruction of ancient archaeological sites{{which|date=June 2016}} around the [[Parthenon]] and [[Acropolis]] in preparation for the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jul/15/internationaleducationnews.artsnews |title=Drills and axes ravage ancient Greek site |author=Helena Smith |date=15 July 2002 |website=theguardian.com |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prior to the Olympic Games, [[MSNBC]] correspondent Rehema Ellis in a story called ''It's Greek to Me: Group Tries to Restore Pagan Worship'' documented the vandalism and arson of a bookstore in Athens which sold books promoting ancient Greek religion. She also interviewed several adherents who were upset about the current state of affairs in Greece. Ellis said: ''"A contrast in this place where the Olympic Games were created to honour [[Zeus]] - now those praying to the ancient gods are criticized for putting too much faith in the past."''
* ''The Greek Society of the Friends of the Ancients'' objected to the commercial use of [[Athena and Phevos]] as the official mascots of the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] held in Athens. They felt that the caricatured representations of the Greek Gods [[Athena]] and [[Phoebus]] were disrespectful and culturally insensitive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.forthnet.gr/ath/heliodromion/e_nea1.htm Extrajudicial protest - denunciation - statement of Greek Citizens, concerning the 2004 Olympics’ “mascot" choice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218003151/http://users.forthnet.gr/ath/heliodromion/e_nea1.htm |date=2006-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a BBC Radio interview on June 26, 2004, Dr. Pan. Marinis President of the ''Societas Hellenica Antiquariorum'' said that the mascots:
::"''mock the spiritual values of the Hellenic Civilization by degrading these same holy personalities that were revered during the ancient Olympic Games. For these reasons we have proceeded to legal action demanding the punishment of those responsible.''"&lt;!--the source for this has been moved, but it exists at http://homepage.mac.com/dodecatheon/index.html (in Greek) and on a tripod site at http://agis10.tripod.com/id8.html--&gt;
* In May 2006 an Athens court granted official recognition to the veneration of the Ancient Greek pantheon. Referring to the ruling, Father Eustathios Kollas, who presides over a community of Greek Orthodox priests, said: ''"They are a handful of miserable resuscitators of a degenerate dead religion who wish to return to the monstrous dark delusions of the past."''&lt;ref name="Ancient Greek gods' new believers"&gt;Ancient Greek gods' new believers.

'''Jan Udo Holey''' (born March 22, 1967 in [[Dinkelsbühl]]), and often known by his pen name '''Jan van Helsing''', is a controversial German author who embraces [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving subjects such as world domination plots by [[freemasonry|freemasons]], [[Hitler]]'s continuing survival in [[Antarctica]] following [[World War II]], the structure of the [[earth]] as [[Hollow Earth|hollow]], and others. His theories draw from sources such as ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''.&lt;ref name="VS"&gt;[[Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz]]: [http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/download/SHOW/broschuere_0511_2_antisemitismus.pdf ''Argumentationsmuster im rechtsextremistischen Antisemitismus]''. November 2005, p. 10f.&lt;/ref&gt;

His books ''Geheimgesellschaften'' (''Secret Societies'') and ''Geheimgesellschaften 2'' have been banned in Germany,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} France&lt;ref&gt;[http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/societe/20070615.OBS2049/prison_avec_sursis_pour_lauteurdun_livre_antisemite.html "Prison avec sursis pour l'auteur d'un livre antisémite"], ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'', February 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Switzerland]] for inciting [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]] hatred.

The majority of his books, such as ''Die Kinder des neuen Jahrtausends. Mediale Kinder verändern die Welt'' (''Children of the New Millennium, and how They Change the World'') are non-political and deal exclusively with [[esoteric]] subjects.

==Life==
Holey was the middle child of a wealthy family. His mother called herself a [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]], and his father wrote three books dealing with [[gnostic]] and [[esoteric]] subject matter. Holey claims to have attended schools in [[Crailsheim]], [[Bammental]] (near [[Heidelberg]]), [[Cambridge]] (in the United Kingdom), and [[Munich]].

Holey chose his [[Pen name|nom de plume]] "van Helsing", after he read [[Bram Stoker]]'s vampire-novel ''[[Dracula]]'' at the age of fourteen.

Today, Holey runs his own publishing house, which publishes his own works as well as of others holding similar interests and viewpoints.

The {{Interlanguage link multi|Landesamt für Verfassungsschutz Baden-Württemberg|de}} (the [[State Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]]) first referred to Holey in a 1996 report entitled "Rechtsextremistische Einflußnahme auf die Esoterikszene" (Right-Wing Extremist Influences on the Esoteric Scene).

==Political opinions==
Holey draws from many esoteric and conspiracy theories, many of which originate in the United States of America. His writings encompass such varied themes as [[Nostradamus]], [[reincarnation]], conspiracy theories regarding [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Uwe Barschel]]'s murders.  According to his detractors, Holey's books are largely plagiarized from other sources, many of which are conspiracy theorists of questionable repute.  The author believes he is banned as part of a larger conspiracy.

In ''Geheimgesellschaften'', Holey combines science-fiction, [[esotericism]], [[Nazi occultism|Nazi-mythology]], [[ufology]] and "[[Zionist]] global domination" theories.  He also employs [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]] as a source.  He believes the [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]]s head a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world and associates them with a mysterious cabal called the [[Illuminati]], who plan a [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]].  Holey and his followers claim that they are not anti-semitic, but rather that they speak out against powerful Jewish interests in high finance and politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infosekta.ch/is5/themen/esoterik_stutz1999.html#VanHelsing Van Helsing: Ideologischer Kern unverändert''] ("Van Helsing: Ideological core unchanged", article in a Swiss antiracist publication 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Robert Davis''' (born July 28, 1945) is an [[United States|American]] [[cartoonist]], best known as the creator of the [[comic strip]]s ''[[Garfield]]'' and ''[[U.S. Acres]]'' (a.k.a. ''Orson's Farm''). Published since 1978, ''Garfield'' is one of the world's most widely syndicated comic strips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/2002/01/28/daily4.html|title=Garfield comic strip makes Guinness Book of World Records |website=[[bizjournals]]|date=2002-01-28|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis's other comics work includes ''[[Tumbleweeds (comic strip)|Tumbleweeds]]'', ''[[Gnorm Gnat]]'' and ''[[Mr. Potato Head]]''.

Davis wrote or co-wrote all of the ''Garfield'' TV specials for [[CBS]], originally broadcast between 1982 and 1991. He also produced the ''[[Garfield &amp; Friends]]'' Saturday Morning series, which aired on the channel from 1988 to 1994. Davis was the writer and executive producer for a series of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] direct-to-video feature films about Garfield, as well as an executive producer for the CGI animated TV series ''[[The Garfield Show]]''.

==Personal life==
Jim Davis was born in [[Marion, Indiana]] on July 28, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=De Weyer |first1=Geert |title=100 stripklassiekers die niet in je boekenkast mogen ontbreken |year=2008 |publisher=Atlas |location=[[Amsterdam]] / [[Antwerp]] |language=Dutch |isbn=978-90-450-0996-4 &lt;!--|page=214--&gt; |page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis grew up on a small farm in [[Fairmount, Indiana]], with his father James William "Jim" Davis, mother Anna Catherine "Betty" (née Carter) Davis, brother Dave and 25 [[cat]]s. Davis's childhood on a farm parallels the life of Garfield's owner, [[Jon Arbuckle]], who was also raised on a farm with his parents and a brother, Doc Boy. Jon is a cartoonist, who also celebrates his birthday on July 28. Davis attended [[Ball State University]] where he studied [[art]] and [[business]]. While attending Ball State, he became a member of the [[Theta Xi]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]].

Davis has been married twice, first to Carolyn (Altekruse), who was allergic to cats,&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;"Those Catty Cartoonists,"  ''Time'' magazine, Dec. 07, 1981; available online at [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953256-1,00.html Time magazine] website.&lt;/ref&gt; though they owned a dog named Molly.&lt;ref name="everything2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=Jim+Davis|title=Jim Davis - Everything2.com|website=everything2.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a son, James Alexander Davis.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/523/000023454/ NNDB profile]. Retrieved March 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 16, 2000, Davis married his current wife, Jill, and had two more children: Ashley and Christopher.&lt;ref name="everything2"/&gt;

In the fall of 2016 Jim Davis joined the faculty of Ball State University in Muncie as an adjunct professor.

Davis resides in [[Albany, Indiana]], where he and his staff produce ''Garfield'' under his [[Paws, Inc.]] company, launched in 1981. Paws, Inc. employs nearly 50 artists and licensing administrators, who work with agents around the world managing Garfield's vast licensing, syndication, and entertainment empire.

Davis is a former president of the Fairmount, Indiana [[National FFA Organization|FFA]] chapter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ffa.org/documents/about_prominentmembers.pdf "National FFA Organization Prominent Members"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713074526/http://www.ffa.org/documents/about_prominentmembers.pdf |date=2010-07-13 }}, National F.F.A. Organization (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Prior to creating Garfield, Davis worked for an advertising agency, and in 1969, he began assisting Tom Ryan's comic strip, ''[[Tumbleweeds (comic strip)|Tumbleweeds]]''. He then created a comic strip, ''[[Gnorm Gnat]]'', that ran for five years in ''The Pendleton Times'', an [[Indiana]] newspaper. When Davis attempted to sell it to a national comic strip [[syndicate]], an editor told him: "Your art is good, your gags are great, but bugs—nobody can relate to bugs!"&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Jim. ''20 Years &amp; Still Kicking!: Garfield's Twentieth Anniversary Collection''. New York: Ballantine Books, 1998, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 1978, ''Garfield'' started syndication in 41 newspapers. Today it is syndicated in 2,580 newspapers and is read by approximately 300 million readers every day.&lt;ref name="BW1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Garfield Named World's Most Syndicated Comic Strip. |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2002_Jan_22/ai_82001296 |accessdate=July 26, 2008 |publisher=[[Business Wire]] |date=January 22, 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121005601/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2002_Jan_22/ai_82001296 |archivedate=January 21, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Davis created the barnyard slapstick comic strip ''U.S. Acres''. Outside the U.S., the strip was known as ''Orson's Farm''. Davis, along with Brett Koth, also made a 2000–03 strip based on the [[Mr. Potato Head]] toy.

Davis founded the Professor Garfield Foundation to support children's literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.professorgarfield.org/parents_teachers/about/about.html|title=TRC About Us: Professor Garfield|accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His influences include [[Mort Walker]]'s ''[[Beetle Bailey]]'' and ''[[Hi and Lois]]'', [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]'', [[Milton Caniff]]'s ''[[Steve Canyon]]'' and [[Johnny Hart]]'s ''[[B.C.

'''Jörmundur Ingi Hansen''' (born 14 August 1940) is an Icelandic [[Modern Paganism|neopagan]] leader. He is the leader of the group Reykjavíkurgoðorð and was the ''[[Allsherjargoði (Ásatrúarfélagið)|allsherjargoði]]'' of [[Ásatrúarfélagið]] from 1994 to 2002.

== Biography ==
In 1972, he was one of the founding members of Ásatrúarfélagið along with its first ''[[Allsherjargoði (Ásatrúarfélagið)|allsherjargoði]]'' [[Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson]], Dagur Þorleifsson and Þorsteinn Guðjónsson. After Sveinbjörn's death in 1993, Jörmundur Ingi became the new ''allsherjargoði'' in 1994. He was elected with 59 votes or 61.8% against 34 votes or 36.2% for [[Haukur Halldórsson]]. One vote was blank.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/138923/ Ásatrúarfélagið Jörmundur Ingi allsherjargoði]. 25 May 1994. [[Morgunblaðið]].&lt;/ref&gt;

He was responsible for much of Ásatrúarfélagið's  media representation and his time as leader marked an increased mainstream acceptance for the group as well as significant membership growth. It also included the acquirement of a building in Reykjavík and the establishment of an official Asatru burial ground, which Jörmundur Ingi designed.&lt;ref name="schnurbein"&gt;[[Stefanie von Schnurbein]]. 2016. Norse Revival: Transformations of Germanic Neopaganism. [[Brill Publishers]]. p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

A conflict emerged when Jörmundur Ingi was unwilling to distribute more tasks among other elected officials within the organization.&lt;ref name="schnurbein" /&gt; He was removed from office in 2002 and was replaced by [[Jónína Kristín Berg]] as a temporary ''allsherjargoði'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/684495/ Yfirlýsing frá Lögréttu]. 25 August 2002. [[Morgunblaðið]].&lt;/ref&gt; before [[Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson]] was elected to the position in 2003 with Jörmundur Ingi's approval.&lt;ref name="schnurbein" /&gt;

In 2004 he left Ásatrúarfélagið and became the leader of the splinter group Reykjavíkurgoðorð.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visir.is/g/2004406190364 Reykjavíkurgoðorð verður félag]. 19 June 2004. [[Vísir.is]].&lt;/ref&gt; The small, non-political group had almost 30 members in 2015, and was not actively seeking new members, although it was open for anyone who wished to join.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnhildur Jónsdóttir. 14 August 2015. [http://www.visir.is/g/2015708149945 Jörmundur Ingi 75 ára í dag]. [[Vísir.is]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Jörmundur Ingi has a great interest in men's fashion and runs a clothing store in Reykjavík. He claims to not earn much from the store, but views it as a service to help men to dress better, as he does not consider contemporary fashion trends to be good for them.&lt;ref&gt;Sólveig Gísladóttir. 2 December 2016.

'''Kushinagar'''  is a pilgrimage town in the Kushinagar district of the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The name of "Kasia Bazaar" was changed to ''Kushinagar'' and then ''Kasia Bazaar'' became a municipality with the official name ''Kushinagar''. 

It is an important [[Buddhist]] pilgrimage site, where Buddhists believe [[Gautama Buddha]] attained [[Parinirvana]] after his death. It is an international Buddhist pilgrimage centre. The followers of Buddhism, especially from Asian countries, wish to visit this place at least once in their lifetime.

==Etymology==
According to one theory, Kushwati was the capital of [[Kosala Kingdom]] and according to [[Ramayana]] it was built by [[Kusha (Ramayana)|King Kush]], son of [[Rama]], protagonist of the epic Ramayana. While according to Buddhist tradition ''Kushawati'' was named prior to the king Kush. The naming of Kushwati is believed to be due to abundance of [[Desmostachya bipinnata|Kush grass]] found in this region.&lt;ref name=Kushi&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kushinagar.nic.in/history/|title=History |publisher=Kushinagar District |date=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

As of 2011 India [[census]], Kushinagar had a population of 22,214,&lt;ref&gt;Census of India: Population Finder, http://censusindia.gov.in/PopulationFinder/View_Village_Population.aspx?pcaid=1249&amp;category=N.P.&lt;/ref&gt; with 3462 households. Males constitute 52% (11,502 Men) of the population and females 48% (10,712 Women). Kushinagar has an average literacy rate of 78.43%, higher than the national average of 74%, male literacy is 85%, and female literacy is 72%. In Kushinagar, 11% of the population is under 10 years of age. [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Schedule Caste (SC)]] constitutes 5.03% while [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Schedule Tribe (ST)]] were 2.39% of total population in Kushinagar Nagar Panchayat.

==History==
The present Kushinagar is identified with Kusavati (in the pre-Buddha period) and Kushinara (in the post-Buddha period). Kushinara was the capital of [[Malla (India)|Mallas]] which was one of the [[Mahajanapadas|sixteen mahajanpads]] of the 6th Century BCE. Since then, it remained an integral part of the erstwhile empires of [[Maurya]], [[Śuṅga Empire|Shunga]], [[Kushana]], [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]], [[Harsha]], and [[Pala Empire|Pala]] dynasties.

In the medieval period, Kushinagar had passed under the suzerainty of Kultury Kings. Kushinara continued to be a living city till the 12th century CE and was thereafter lost into oblivion. Padrauna is believed to be ruled over by a Rajput adventurer, Madan Singh, in the 15th century CE.

[[File:Conjectural reconstruction of the main gate of Kusinagara circa 500 BCE adapted from a relief at Sanchi.jpg|thumb|left|Conjectural reconstruction of the main gate of Kusinagara circa 500 BCE adapted from [[:File:City of Kusinagara in the War over the Buddha's Relics, South Gate, Stupa no. 1, Sanchi.jpg|this]] relief at [[Sanchi]]]]

However, modern Kushinagar came into prominence in the 19th century with archeological excavations carried out by [[Alexander Cunningham]], the first [[Archaeological Survey of India|Archeological Surveyor of India]] and later followed by C.L. Carlleyle who exposed the main stupa and also discovered a 6.10 meters long statue of reclining Buddha in 1876. Excavations continued in the early twentieth century under [[J. Ph. Vogel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vogel J Ph. | year = 1950 | title = Some Buddhist Monasteries in Ancient India | url = | journal = Journal of the Ceylon branch of the Royal Asiatic Society | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 27–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He conducted archaeological campaigns in 1904-5, 1905-6 and 1906-7,  uncovering a wealth of Buddhist materials.

Chandra Swami, a Burmese monk, came to India in 1903 and made Mahaparinirvana Temple into a living shrine.

After independence, Kushinagar remained part of the district of [[Deoria district|Deoria]]. On 13 May 1994, it came into being as a new district of [[Uttar Pradesh]].&lt;ref name=Kushihistory&gt;{{cite web|title=Kushinagar History|url=http://kushinagar.nic.in/history.htm|website=''kushinagar.nic.in''|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location of Gautama Buddha's death and parinirvana==

In 1896, Waddell suggested that the site of the death and [[parinirvana]] of Gautama Buddha was in the region of [[Rampurva]].&lt;ref&gt;"A Tibetan Guide-book to the Lost Sites of the Buddha's Birth and Death", [[L. A. Waddell]]. [[Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal]], 1896, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'', the Buddha made his journey to Kushinagar, died there and wherein he was cremated.&lt;ref name=fogelin2015p23/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=John Guy| title=The Mahabodhi temple|journal=The Burlington Magazine| year=1991| volume=133| number=1059|jstor=884751| pages=356–357}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that during his last day he walked into the groves of tress near the city and rejoiced at the blossoms of sala trees (Shorea robusta) before laying himself to rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddh for the young|last=S.|first=Bhattacharya|isbn=81-237-2006-8|publisher=National Book Trust, India|edition=1st|year=1996|location=New Delhi|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholarship, based on archaeological evidence, believes that the Buddha died in Kushinagar, close to the modern Kasia (Uttar Pradesh).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=United Nations|title=Promotion of Buddhist Tourism Circuits in Selected Asian Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F9ZhFMWSYKsC&amp;pg=PA23|year=2003|publisher=United Nations Publications|isbn=978-92-1-120386-8|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Trainor |title=Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PrloTKuAjwC |year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517398-7 |pages=41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Elizabeth Lyons|author2=Heather Peters|author3=Chʻeng-mei Chang|title=Buddhism: History and Diversity of a Great Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hkdxmAYVbJUC&amp;pg=PA17|year=1985|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology|isbn=978-0-934718-76-9|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred S.

'''Mayapur''' is a holy city located on the banks of the [[Ganges]] river, at the point of its confluence with the [[Jalangi River|Jalangi]], near [[Navadvip|Nabadwip]], [[West Bengal]], [[India]], 130&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Kolkata]] ([[Calcutta]]). The headquarters of [[ISKCON]] are situated in Mayapur and it is considered a holy place by a number of other traditions within [[Hinduism]], regarded as a special [[incarnation]] of [[Krishna]] in the mood of [[Radha]]. It is visited by over a million pilgrims annually.

In 1886 a leading [[Gaudiya Vaisnava]] reformer [[Bhaktivinoda Thakur]] attempted to retire from his government service and move to [[Vrindavan]] to pursue his devotional life there.{{sfn|Dasa|1999|pp=100-101}} However, he saw a dream in which Lord Chaitanya ordered him to go to [[Nabadwip]] instead.{{sfn|Dasa|1999|p=101}}  After some difficulty, in 1887 Bhaktivinoda Thakur was transferred to [[Krishnanagar, Nadia|Krishnanagar]], a district center twenty-five kilometers away from Nabadwip, famous as the birthplace of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.{{sfn|Dasa|1999|pp=102-103}} Despite poor health, Thakur Bhaktivinoda finally managed to start regularly visiting Nabadwip to research places connected with Lord Chaitanya.{{sfn|Dasa|1999|pp=103-105}} Soon he came to a conclusion that the site purported by the local ''brahmanas'' to be Lord Chaitanya's birthplace could not possibly be genuine.{{sfn|Dasa|1999|p=104}} Determined to find the actual place of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's pastimes but frustrated by the lack of reliable evidence and clues, one night he saw a mystical vision:{{sfn|Fuller|2005|p=209}}

{{quote|By 10 o'clock the night was very dark and cloudy. Across the Ganges in a northern direction I suddenly saw a large building flooded with golden light. I asked Kamala if he could see the building and he said that he could. But my friend Kerani Babu could see nothing. I was amazed. What could it be? In the morning I went back to the roof and looked carefully back across the Ganges. I saw that in the place where I had seen the building was a stand of palm trees. Inquiring about this area I was told that it was the remains of Lakshman Sen's fort at Ballaldighi.{{sfn|Dasa|1999|p=104}}}}

Taking this as a clue, Bhaktivinoda Thakur conducted a thorough, painstaking investigation of the site, by consulting old geographical maps matched against scriptural and verbal accounts, and eventually came to a conclusion that the village of Ballaldighi was formerly known as Mayapur, confirmed in ''[[Bhakti-ratnakara]]'' as the actual birth site of Chaitanya.{{sfn|Dasa|1999|p=105}} He soon acquired a property in Surabhi-kunj near Mayapur to oversee the temple construction at Yogapith, Chaitanya's birthplace.{{sfn|Dasa|1999|p=108}} For this purpose he organized, via ''Sajjana-tosani'' and special festivals, as well as personal acquaintances, a massive and hugely successful fundraising effort among the people of Bengal and beyond.that{{sfn|Fuller|2005|pp=243-250}} Noted Bengali journalist [[Sisir Kumar Ghosh]] (1840-1911) commended Thakur Bhaktivinoda for the discovery and hailed him as "the seventh goswami" – a reference to the [[Six Goswamis of Vrindavana|Six Goswamis]], renowned medieval Gaudiya Vaisnava [[asceticism|ascetics]] and close associates of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu who had authored many of the school's texts and discovered places of Lord Krishna's pastimes in Vrindavan.{{sfn|Dasa|1999|pp=106-107}}

The Panca-tattva comprises Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Nityananda Prabhu, Advaita Acharya, Gadadhara Pandit and Srivas Thakur.

==Gaudiya Vaishnava temples==

There are a number of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]] organizations in Mayapur, such as the [[Gaudiya Math]]. The town is heavily centered on this particular Vaishnava religious tradition, officially known as the [[Brahma Sampradaya|Brahma-Madhva-Gaudiya Sampradaya]], with temples devoted to [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]] or [[Caitanya Mahaprabhu|Gaura]]-[[Nityananda|Nitai]] throughout; however, there is a sizable [[Islam|Muslim]] population in the historical center, previously called Miyapur.

The Gaudiya-Vaishnava devotees every year circumambulate the various places of Lord Chaitanya's pastimes in the group of nine islands known as ''Navdvip''. This Parikrama takes about 7 days. This event takes place around the Gaur Purnima Festival (Appearance Day of Lord Chaitanya). ISKCON devotees from all over the world come to Mayapur for this auspicious Parikrama to celebrate the Lord's Divine Appearance Day.

The '''Members of the Covenant''' were an important part of early [[Syriac Christianity]]. Before the advent of [[monasticism]] proper (which developed in the [[desert]] of [[Egypt]]), most Syriac churches would consist of a community focused around the members of the covenant: men and women who had committed themselves to [[sexual abstinence]] and the service of the church. This name is the English translation of the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''bnay qyāmâ'' (&lt;span lang="syr" dir="rtl"&gt;ܒܢܝ ܩܝܡܐ&lt;/span&gt;), literally ''sons of the covenant''. A male member of the covenant was called ''bar qyāmâ'' (&lt;span lang="syr" dir="rtl"&gt;ܒܪ ܩܝܡܐ&lt;/span&gt;), or ''son of the covenant''; a female member was ''bat qyāmâ'' (&lt;span lang="syr" dir="rtl"&gt;ܒܪܬ ܩܝܡܐ&lt;/span&gt;), or ''daughter of the covenant''.

While that became the prevailing concept of how ascetics lived in the [[Western Roman Empire]], in Persia things developed with a slightly altered perspective. With only a few exceptions, Syrian monks learned to live among the people, both Christian and non-Christian, living the strict ascetic lifestyle while still maintaining full cohesion in the world about them. The eastern ascetics saw their spiritually disciplined life as a journey of steps, adopting the notion that all were equal in God’s eyes, each finding oneself on a stairway of godliness that led ultimately towards eternity with God.

The Members of the Covenant held a different but wholesome view of spirituality of a journey of steps toward God.

==History==

===Third Century===
Asceticism in [[Egypt]] and Syria seemed to have more differences in doctrine and practice than what they shared together. The late third century shows two distinct groups pursuing celibacy, poverty and homelessness all for the sake of freeing their lives from the troubles of this world. However, the major dividing principle between the two groups was their leader in the movement.

Egyptians saw their figurehead as [[Anthony the Great]], the founding father of Egyptian monasticism and cultivator of what dominant Egyptian monasticism had come to stand for by that time.  Syrian monks on the other hand, based their purpose and practice on apostolic precedent; and more accurately, the life and teachings of Christ and his disciples. While this may seem presumptuous, it truly created a fundamental difference in the goals and direction of Syrian monks that sent them on a path toward meaningful interaction with the world that surrounded them.

Up until the late third century, both groups of Christians felt the pressures of their surrounding social and political world.  The Egyptians, like the Persians, were marginalized and persecuted for their faith, but only until an emperor by the name of Constantine arrived on the scene. His conversion and Christian presence on the throne in Rome was felt dramatically throughout the Roman Empire. While many were excited about the influx of believers following Constantine’s example, many others saw the mainstreaming of Sunday congregations as a negative influence on what Christ had actually called them to. They needed a higher call to discipleship, and certainly before the fourth century, there was the creation of the Egyptian monk. Conversely, Syriac Christianity never found itself in the mainstream of acceptability in its surrounding society.  Because of this, “wanderers of third-century Syria introduce[d] a motive for practicing Christian asceticism that is different from anything we have found preserved in Egyptian desert tradition.”&lt;ref name="Caner2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Caner|first=Daniel|title=Wandering, Begging Monks: Spiritual Authority and the Promotion of Monasticism in Late Antiquity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WG0lDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56|year=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23324-9|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its very beginning, Syriac Christianity was intrinsically an ascetical faith built on its reactions and adoptions from [[Marcionism]], and [[Manichaeism]] among other cultural heresies which promoted the Christian faith as radical dedication and sacrifice; something monastic living the world over was centered on. Thus, the Syriac Christians heard Jesus’ words of “whoever wants to save his life will lose it,”  as a challenge to seek a drastic way of living which measures up to Jesus’ call for discipleship.

So what real difference did Christ as head of the monastic movement in Persia create?  It was found in the Syrians’ refusal to flee from a culture in which they felt called to serve and transform.  Unlike Egyptian monks who felt the need to escape the pressures of Roman rule in order to form Christ-like lives in an isolated desert, the marginalized Syriac ascetics remained enmeshed in the church and lost culture that surrounded them.

These monks of Persia did not view their ascetic lifestyle as radically unobtainable for the average Christian filling the pews on Sundays, (as opposed to many of the Egyptian monks of their day who saw their newly converted brothers and sisters as nominal at best), and they remained a prominent part of the local congregations in their town or village.  Instead of an unimaginable leap of faith separated by monastic discipline and judgment, Syriac ascetics encouraged a faith-building understanding of discipleship that viewed the Christian faith as a journey; one in which we all find ourselves.  Because of this, the monks of Persia felt a sense of duty to come alongside those they could mentor and guide to the next step in their faith, hoping to see those on earlier steps to grow as well.

The overwhelming presence of Western monasticism was not totally foreign to the minds of Syrian Christians seeking the paths for ascetic life. [[Theodoret]] gives historians a beautiful rendition of the early individualistic tendencies in the monks of Syria in his book about their history. Notable examples of extreme asceticism were the {{lang|grc| βοσκοί}} ''boskoi'' "grazers", monks who lived in the wild and were often mistaken for strange animals.  Wrapped in goatskins or straw mats, they avoided all forms of artificial clothing or shelter and only ate what they were given or they found already growing on the ground. Needless to say, this was an extreme form of an individualistic faith that led many well-intentioned monks to the tops of pillars for forty years and others to wearing their heads raw from beating it against the ground.

The regions of the [[Sasanian Empire]] stretched far and wide, creating great distances between Christian groups that were developing and expressing themselves in radically different ways. "We do know that it was extremely complex in its diversity – so much so that it is impossible to make assessments with regard to Christian orthodoxy from that period.”{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Because there was no overarching rule governing the civilization of Christianity, (much like one might find in the neighboring Roman Empire), Christians were more free to slip around the dogmas of the Catholics and develop widely different understanding of living the Christian life.  For example, in contrast to the staunch individualistic faith seen in the rural wildernesses around them, Christians in the Persian urban areas were more intent on creating a community of believers by creating and transforming it through Christian discipleship.  “From the earliest times asceticism played an integral and affirming role in the communities and the faith of Syrian Christians…discipleship to Christ, lived out by laymen and women through varying degrees…constituted the highest expression of Christian life.”{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Communal monasticism became more and more common during the early part of the fourth century, leaving behind the influences of the Egyptian ascetic paradigm.

===Fourth Century===
During this crucial fourth century and beyond, the notions of individualistic faith changed and developed into the image of Christians as “strangers”.  Syriac Christians that began seeing themselves as “strangers” to the world did not mean they were isolated and removed from it, but rather they “assume[d] a special responsibility for it and power within it, drawn precisely from the status of ‘stranger’.”  Monks of this lineage acted as a missionary to his own community, a “teacher of children, healer, arbitrator…”    They were missionally minded, building a life around hospitality to others, serving the poor, and standing up for cases of social justice.  “For them, following Christ meant active engagement, as Christ’s representatives, with the ‘world’ they had renounced, rather than permanent social withdrawal.”

It is out of this context that the “Sons and Daughters of the Covenant”  were born. “We must be reminded that the first Christian impulses in the lands of the Euphrates and Tigris did not come from Hellenistic Christianity via Antioch but from Palestinian Jewish Christianity…these archaic conditions, which understood the qeiama as the whole congregation of celibates who alone were admitted to baptism and sacramental life, were tenacious and were able to last for generations.” Living the life of celibacy and ascetic dedication to their Lord; the church thrived.

During this time however, historical records of the church in Syria indicate that a major shift took place, and it began to initiate the Roman concepts of church into their practice.  This led to dividing grounds between the benai and benat qeiama against the married and vocational members who were also active participants in the world’s society around them.  It was at this moment that a crucial split could have taken place.  There was opportunity for these two groups to separate, both willing to follow God with all of their hearts, but both understanding what it means to follow Jesus as radically different and conflicting.  However, through reconciliation and the grace of God, they merged and adopted a syncretism of belief; understanding their spiritual growth as steps.

From the beginning of the fourth century, the Sons and Daughters of the Covenant saw their mission as deeply interwoven with the congregational church.  No longer were Syriac Christians living the Christian life for themselves, it now operationally took “a church to raise a Christian.”   The members of the qeiama understood themselves to be what we might think of today as deacons.  They usually lived together or with their family members, but there are instances of the benat qeiama (daughters of the covenant) to have convents and other communal organizations with which they could live and study God’s Word together.   Each of them took the vow of chastity in becoming a member of the covenant, and through this vow they saw themselves vehemently as the “brides of Christ”.  They surrounded this practice with layers of strict doctrine that did not allow them to be out after dark or for the benat to live with a man, lest they fall into temptation.  They even had a judicial law that sent a dysfunctional covenanter to a secluded monastery, and renaming them bart qeiama denoting their failure to live up to the life-covenant to which they were called.

Functionally in the congregation, these qeiama were students and servants of the clergy.  This meant that there were certain rules against a Son or Daughter from becoming a hireling or staff for a farmer, or any other vocation – they were to be completely devoted to the works and ministries of the church.  It is certain that members of the qeiama were directly involved with the worship service itself, “In [[Edessa]] the qeiama of women had a part in the liturgy, reciting the hymns composed by Ephrem.”   Outside of the worship service, the benai and benat qeiama were set to the task of serving and blessing others in the congregation, as well as those not connected to a place of Christian faith.

For example, a hospital was built from the efforts of one congregation’s Covenant Group, and the structure of administering the hospital sheds light on how the roles and responsibilities of each member of the congregation was dispensed.  “Active believers and energetic deacons were appointed to direct the work, but for the actual service, Rabbula employed the benai qeiama.”  Roles are mirrored for the women’s hospital built nearby.  Charities for lepers in their village, shelters for the poor and destitute, as well as other institutions of Christian love kept the hands and feet of the qeiama busy as they met the needs of a hurting world.  These “monks” (if they can truly be called as such) were anything but removed from those who needed their love the most, making their presence a powerful and effective one in the surrounding community.

In their dedication to helping the poor to see God’s love they became the centerpiece of the Christian community.  One ancient source remarking on the necessity of the Covenant children boldly states, “the churches and monasteries will be constituted (or will have their existence) through them.”   The very purposes the church sought to fulfill were exemplified in these Sons and Daughters of the Covenant, thus creating a standard for all other members of the church, both clergy and lay, to strive towards.

While there was much good in the services of the Sons and Daughters of the Covenant, there had yet to develop in Syriac asceticism an institutional framework for spiritual development that would progress a Christian in his journey with God and man.  Enter the Liber Graduum.  A series of what might be called sermons or devotionals, the Liber Graduum or “Book of Steps” creates a concrete path for Christians to walk from the earliest steps of faith to the boldest leaps of evangelistic asceticism.  This was all done in the context of community; there were no “Lone-Rangers” of the faith as is seen in Coptic spirituality.  The audiences of the Liber Graduum, as well as those associated with other important works not developed here (such as Letters to Virgins), built a world for themselves that supported such reliance upon each other and corporate understanding that to truly understand Syriac Christianity in Late Antiquity we must examine their texts.

“The Liber Graduum portrays a prime example of a community that summoned Christians to a higher view, but still viewed this life, body and Church as a part of God’s world.”   The Liber Graduum for early Syriac Christians was not just a commentary on Scripture that was kept on a dusty shelf in a library.  The eclectic mēmrā or what might be translated “sermons” seem to indicate a wide variety of situations that a community faced compiled over many years.

Michael Kmosko was the first to translate and comment on the Liber Graduum in 1926, categorizing it with its contemporary Messalian heresy that was striking the Persian Church at its time of writing.   A later commenter Daniel Caner described the Liber Graduum as a threat in the eyes of the common Christian public of its day, inciting rebellion against the institutional Church found all over the Roman Empire.   Finally however, David Lane does a concise and well-balanced overview of the Liber Graduum.

Lane suggests that the author of the mēmrā in the Book of Steps was trying to wrestle (as was his community) with Jesus’ different calls of discipleship to different people.  To some Jesus would ask only that they believe in Him, and they would be healed; to others Jesus demanded nothing short of their total renunciation of property and family before they could follow in His footsteps.  To Lane, the Liber Graduum builds for its community a tension between these commands, bridging them into a sort of staircase; ascending in the levels of the Christian life.

==Six Profiles==
The anonymous author of the Liber Graduum points out six profiles of the Christian life, and claims that each Christian must evaluate where they are, and where others are around them, and work as a community to struggle up the staircase towards holiness.  But what did these steps look like?  How did they function in the midst of community?  By looking closely at these Christian-life profiles and descriptions, we begin to see the values and needs of the Syriac Christians emerge.

By far, the author spends the majority of his efforts focusing and developing the top two steps, the “Upright” and the “Perfect”.  The first nine mēmrā focus on the Perfect and the ways in which all other forms of spiritual living compare, yet are inferior to it.  The Upright are called to fulfill the minor commandments in Scripture and the Perfect are to follow the major commands.  According to the author’s view of salvation, God does not hold the same requirements for each person in living out the life he has called them to live.  An example of such a distinction is made in Mēmrā Fourteen, “The Upright discern good people from evil ones and are moved with compassion upon the latter; the Perfect consider [others] as better than themselves.”   The Upright were those who strove with everything they were to be radical followers of Jesus.  The Perfect however, having given up all their possessions, and worldly relationships, (even family and wife in some instances ), were not only striving to be followers, they were seen as angels on Earth.  These profiles are not necessarily a job description for those on the step, but a caricature of what the author is looking for and what he sees Jesus calling them to.

The next two groups he quickly sketches are the Sick and the Children.  The Children, simply put, are infants in the faith.  They are new to the experience of following Jesus and therefore little is expected of their spiritual dedication.  In fact, the most significant command for the Children is that, in their fledgling commitment to Christ, they must stay away from negative influences (such as pagan friends, etc.) that might pull them back into the world they are trying to escape from.  The Sick harm, judge, and condemn their neighbors, instead of forgiving them as an Upright or a Perfect one would do.

While there is little difference between the Upright and the Perfect, and the Disciples of Faith and the Disciples of Love respectively, the author sees a clear distinction.  Without much more than a brief reference here and there, the Liber Graduum places the Disciples of Faith and the Disciples of Love in between the Upright and Perfect, as sort of bridge points for those on the track to becoming “Perfect”.   Instead of leaving Christians alone in their spiritual walks toward righteous living, these six silhouettes of faith in the Syriac Church enabled Christians to dream of where their journey of faith might be calling them next.

Just as with any black and white text that is designed to facilitate the lifestyles of a colorful and changing community, so the brothers and sisters living under the guidance of the Liber Graduum became increasingly confused and conflicted as to how they were to live with each other on different steps.  Pastoral reactions to conflict and spite fill much of the pages of the Liber Graduum, working over a period of what could be years to smooth out the finer lines of relationship between those on differing steps.

There was internal conflict which was mostly frustration toward the Perfect.  The author bereaves the elevated status of the Perfect, likening them unto “perfect” examples of the human race, one in which all humans can look to and model after.  However, since they were merely to “love everyone” and yet had given up the majority of their relationships, many saw the Perfect as totally hypocritical and useless in bettering the community.  Everyone had something against them, the poor thought the Perfect as wealthy and comfortable, the starving thought all the Perfect did was recline and eat the best foods.

Beyond this concern, certain familial and religious conflict within the community began its downward spiral into oblivion.  Families were concerned with children on the path to becoming one of the Perfect or Upright, and many non-Christian family members were harassing the “Children” of the Faith and causing the Children to recede.  The author warns his audience, passionately reminding them of the persecution Jesus foretold on those who followed His ways.

==Liber Graduum==
The fact that the author of the Liber Graduum sees his church as collapsing morally and spiritually is a key to understanding the reason and purpose behind the book.  In Mēmrā Twenty-Nine, he admonishes his community for their slack behavior and spiritual laziness.  He mourns the former days when the community was more dedicated to the principles outlined in earlier sermons.  “We teach these others, but we do not teach ourselves…we talk about these [predecessors], but do not act like them.”   It is possible that those Perfect and Upright were beginning to relax in their dedication to holy living, pursuing instead a more dualistic understanding of the world.  This understanding helped them feel above the need for prayer or compassion, with influences coming possibly from the current Messalian heresy that held similar views.   As the community loses focus on the “journey” image and function of the Christian life, they move further into decline.  Instead of hearing the author’s message as “steps toward godliness” it is possible that those in the community felt they were more a part of a caste system in which was impossible to progress.

The value of an integrated spiritual community was obvious to the author of the Liber Graduum.  His dream to house the deepest ascetics and newborns in the faith under the same congregational roof was a powerful one.  As a pastor of the community, he could never come alongside every single member and nudge them towards righteousness in God; just as with all things in Syriac Christianity of that time, it had to be a communal effort.  Building a tightly knit spiritual group of people that depended on each other led to mentorship among those on the “steps” that could not have happened in more individualistic settings.  With the author’s dream realized, all members could potentially teach and be taught by other members of the group, forming and equipping skills necessary for the Christian life for that time.  This was a beautiful dream, and a fascinating reality.

Cherishing spiritually integrated communities is something that does not change through the ages.  Now, possibly more than ever, we are challenged to build authentic relationships with other believers, teaching and equipping them to take the next step in their faith.  This faith of course does not leave us in the closets where we learned it, but emboldens us to walk out onto the streets, being the same powerfully Christian presence that we see in the Sons and Daughters of the Covenant and Liber Graduum communities so many years before us.

Syriac Ascetics made a powerful impact in the world because they lived their life in integrated communities, and understood the Christian life as a journey of steps toward godliness.  Throughout this paper, we have considered the specific differences of the Egyptian and Syriac models of asceticism, highlighting the positive influences an integrated community that is missionally minded can have on the lost world around them.  Turning then to the Sons and Daughters of the Covenant, we saw a relationally driven lifestyle which was connected to the overall church body and yet held with dignity the covenants of monastic faith these Christians felt called to.  The community under the Liber Graduum shows us how process and growth can happen in an intentional and structured way.  In this paper, we investigated one group’s framework for living this spiritual process out in the midst of the entire congregation.

We are on a journey towards becoming again the perfect imago dei (image of God).  Christ became just like us so that we could become more like his Father.  Realizing that this task is a lifelong journey that bleeds over mysteriously into the afterlife is something that all Christians are challenged to consider.  This world is not our home, and taking advice from the Liber Graduum, we can never reach “perfection” until we have made it back into our Father’s arms.  While this is true, we have certainly been called to follow everyday closer to Jesus, our Master.  Living as a participant with Jesus on the journey back home is a powerful testimony to a lost world searching for direction.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Messiah'' Part I}}
'''''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''''' ([[Händel-Werke-Verzeichnis|HWV]] 56), the English-language [[oratorio]] composed by [[George Frideric Handel]] in 1741, is [[Structure of Handel's Messiah|structured]] in three parts. The wordbook (also called libretto or text) was supplied by [[Charles Jennens]].  This article covers '''Part I''' and describes the relation of the musical setting to the text.  Part I begins with the prophecy of the [[Messiah#Christianity|Messiah]] and his virgin birth by several prophets, namely [[Isaiah]]. His [[Nativity of Jesus|birth]] is still rendered in words by Isaiah, followed by the [[annunciation to the shepherds]] as the only scene from a Gospel in the oratorio, and reflections on the Messiah's deeds. [[Messiah Part II|Part II]] covers the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], death, resurrection, [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]], and the later spreading of the Gospel. [[Messiah Part III|Part III]] concentrates on [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s teaching of the [[1 Corinthians 15#Resurrection of the dead: 12-58|resurrection of the dead]] and Christ's [[Book of Revelation#Outline|glorification in heaven]].

The popular Part I of ''Messiah'' is sometimes called the "Christmas" portion{{r|MAO ChristmasPortion}} as it is frequently performed during Advent in concert, [[sing-along]], or as a [[Scratch Messiah]].  When performed in this way, it usually concludes with "Hallelujah" (chorus) from Part II as the finale.

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Messiah, the oratorio ==

The [[libretto]] by Jennens is drawn from the Bible: mostly from the [[Old Testament]] of the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]], but with several [[psalms]] taken from the [[Book of Common Prayer]].{{r|Block 2001}}{{r|Powell 2009}} Regarding the text, Jennens commented: "...the Subject excells every other Subject. The Subject is Messiah ...".{{r|Heighes 1997}}

''Messiah'' differs from Handel's other oratorios in that it does not contain an encompassing narrative, instead offering contemplation on different aspects of the Christian Messiah:

{{quote
| ''Messiah'' is not a typical Handel oratorio; there are no named characters, as are usually found in Handel’s setting of the Old Testament stories, possibly to avoid charges of blasphemy. It is a meditation rather than a drama of personalities, lyrical in method; the narration of the story is carried on by implication, and there is no dialogue.

=== Structure and concept ===

{{main|Structure of Handel's Messiah}}

The oratorio's structure follows the [[liturgical year]]: Part I corresponding with [[Advent]], [[Christmas]], and the life of Jesus; Part II with [[Lent]], [[Easter]], the [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension]], and [[Pentecost]]; and Part III with the end of the church year—dealing with the end of time. The birth and death of Jesus are told in the words of the prophet [[Isaiah]] (the most prominent source for the libretto). The only true scene of the oratorio is the [[annunciation to the shepherds]] which is taken from the [[Gospel of Luke]].{{r|Gascoigne 2007}}{{r|Luckett 1992}} The imagery of shepherd and lamb features prominently in many movements, for example: in the aria "He shall feed His flock like a shepherd" (the only extended piece to talk about the Messiah on earth), in the opening of Part II ("Behold the Lamb of God"), in the chorus "All we like sheep", and in the closing chorus of the work ("Worthy is the Lamb").

=== Music ===

By the time Handel composed ''Messiah'' in London he was already a successful and experienced composer of Italian operas, and had created sacred works based on English texts, such as the 1713 ''[[Utrecht Te Deum and Jubilate]]'', and numerous oratorios on English [[Libretto|libretti]]. For ''Messiah'', Handel used the same musical technique as for those works, namely a structure based on chorus and solo singing.

Only two movements in ''Messiah'' are purely instrumental: the overture (written as "Sinfony" in Handel's autograph) and the Pifa (a [[pastorale]] introducing the shepherds in Bethlehem); and only a few movements are a duet or a combination of solo and chorus. The solos are typically a combination of recitative and aria. The arias are called Airs or Songs, and some of them are in [[da capo]] form, but rarely in a strict sense (repeating the first section after a sometimes contrasting middle section). Handel found various ways to use the format freely to convey the meaning of the text. Occasionally verses from different biblical sources are combined into one movement, however more often a coherent text section is set in consecutive movements, for example the first "[[Structure of Handel's Messiah#Scenes|scene]]" of the work, the annunciation of [[Christian salvation|Salvation]], is set as a sequence of three movements: recitative, aria and chorus.

The movements marked "Recitative" are "[[Recitative#Secco|secco]]", accompanied by only the [[Basso continuo|continuo]], whereas the recitatives marked "Accompagnato" are accompanied by additional string instruments. Handel used four voice parts, [[soprano]], [[alto]], [[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] in the solo and choral movements. The orchestra scoring is simple: [[oboe]]s, [[String instrument|strings]] and [[Figured bass#Basso continuo|basso continuo]] of [[harpsichord]], [[violoncello]], [[violone]] and [[bassoon]]. Two trumpets and [[timpani]] highlight selected movements, for example in Part I the song of the angels ''Glory to God in the highest''. Handel uses both [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] and [[Homophony|homophonic]] settings to illustrate the text best. Even polyphonic movements typically end on a dramatic long musical [[Rest (music)|rest]], followed by a broad homophonic conclusion. Handel often stresses a word by extended [[coloratura]]s, especially in several movements which are a [[Parody#Music|parody]] of music composed earlier on Italian texts. He uses a [[cantus firmus]] on long repeated notes especially to illustrate God's speech and majesty, for example "for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it" in movement [[#4|4]].{{r|Burrows 1991}}

=== General notes ===

The following table is organized by movement numbers. There are two major systems of numbering the movements of ''Messiah'': the historic [[Novello &amp; Co|Novello]] edition of 1959 (which is based on earlier editions and contains 53 movements), and the [[Bärenreiter]] edition of 1965 in the [[Hallische Händel-Ausgabe]]. Not counting some short recitatives as separate movements, there are therefore 47 movements. In the table below, the Novello number (Nov) is given first and is the index for the notes to individual movements in the "movements" section, then the Bärenreiter number (Bär).

To emphasise the movements in which the oboes and the rarely used trumpets play, the summary below does not mention the regular basso continuo and the strings in movements. Details on the development of [[Key signature|key]]s, different [[tempo]] markings and [[Time signature|time]]s within a movement are given in notes on the individual movements. Movements originally in Italian are indicated in the Source column, however the exact origin is supplied in the notes on the movement. Typically a "scene" of recitative(s) and aria(s) is concluded with a choral movement.

{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 01 sinfony.ogg|title=1st movement (sinfony)|description=Performed by the MIT Concert Choir, William Cutter directing (3:42)}}
'''Sinfony'''

The [[Sinfony]], set for oboes and strings, is in two parts in the style of a [[French overture]] (a slow first part and a [[fugue]]). The fugue subject is presented by the unaccompanied violins, which is a feature that returns in the final [[Amen]] of the oratorio. The key of [[E minor]] has been interpreted as creating "a mood without hope".{{r|Block 2001}}

=== Scene 1 ===
[[Structure of Handel's Messiah#Scenes|Scene 1]] deals with general prophecies of salvation. In three movements, five consecutive verses from the [[Book of Isaiah]] are treated—foretelling the return to Jerusalem ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Isaiah | chapter = 40 | verse = 1 | range = –5 }}) following the [[Babylonian captivity]].

====2 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 02 comfort ye.ogg|title="Comfort ye my people" (HWV 56)|description=Performed by the MIT Concert Choir, William Cutter directing (2:51)}}
'''Comfort ye, comfort ye my people'''

The first vocal movement (a tenor accompagnato) is based on three verses—the words of God beginning with "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people".

==== 3 ====

'''Ev'ry valley shall be exalted'''

The Air for tenor expands the words "Ev'ry valley shall be exalted", which are frequently heard during [[Advent]] (preparing a way for the Lord). The voice illustrates the exaltation by long coloraturas, whereas "plain" is depicted with a long note. More [[word painting]] occurs in a low note for "low" and a complicated figure for "crooked".

{{listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 03 ev'ry valley.ogg|title=“Ev’ry valley shall be exalted” (HWV 56)|description=Performed by the MIT Concert Choir, William Cutter directing (3:32)
|filename2=Handel - messiah - 04 and the glory of the lord.ogg|title2="The glory of the lord"|description2=Performed by the MIT Concert Choir, William Cutter directing (2:37)}}
'''And the glory, the glory of the Lord'''

The chorus enters the work for the first time, and joined by the oboes, announces the revelation of God's glory: "And the glory, the glory of the Lord". The alto begins, the other voices answer (mostly homophonically), and gradually the music grows to a denser texture. The words "for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it" are set as a [[cantus firmus]] of solemn and repeated long notes, which appear first in single voices, and then after a long rest, conclude the movement in affirmative homophony.

=== Scene 2 ===
[[Structure of Handel's Messiah#Scenes|Scene 2]] speaks in three movements of the apparition of God. An accompagnato is based on the words of the prophet [[Haggai]], dealing with the [[Book of Haggai#Outline|splendor of the temple]], and of [[Malachi]] who foretold the [[Book of Malachi#In Christianity|coming messenger]]. Malachi's words are continued in an aria and a chorus.

==== 5 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 05 thus saith the lord.ogg|title=” Thus saith the lord”|description=Performed by the MIT Concert Choir, William Cutter directing (1:18)}}
'''Thus saith the Lord'''

The bass begins the accompagnato: "Thus saith the Lord". Again the words of the Lord, as told by the prophet [[Book of Haggai|Haggai]] ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Haggai | chapter = 2 | verse = 6 | range = –7 }}) are given to a single male voice. In "and I will shake all nations", the "shake" is rendered several times in downward coloraturas of more than a measure, and in "and the desire of all nations shall come" the word "desire" is rendered once in upward coloraturas of more than two measures, accompanied by exited repetitions in the strings and continuo. The music then suddenly calms to an unaccompanied line on the words of the prophet [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]]: "The Lord, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to his temple" ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Malachi | chapter = 3 | verse = 1 }}).

==== 6 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 06 but who may abide.ogg|title=” But who may abide”|description=Performed by the MIT Concert Choir, William Cutter directing (4:16)}}
'''But who may abide'''

The prophecy continues in two movements. The Air for soprano, alto, countertenor, or bass, as a human reaction to the words of God, shows the trembling in the expectation of the Lord's appearance twofold in a dramatic scene. The Air begins with the pensive question "But who may abide" and continues, in a sharp shift of time and tempo "Prestissimo", with the statement "For He is like a refiner's fire". Forceful downward runs, leaps and trills of the voice are accompanied by fiery figuration in the strings. Like a da capo, the pensive question is repeated, but in a short version, giving way once more to a prestissimo section. The statement returns a final time after a rest, marked Adagio, giving the soloist the opportunity to express it in a [[cadenza]]. A prestissimo postlude concludes the dramatic scene. Handel rewrote this dramatic scene in London in 1750 for the castrato [[Gaetano Guadagni]], after he had initially set the text as a recitative for bass.{{r|Keates 2007}}

==== 7 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 07 and he shall purify.ogg|title=” He shall purify”|description=Performed by the MIT Concert Choir, William Cutter directing (2:53)}}
'''And he shall purify'''

The chorus picks up the idea in the fugue "And he shall purify", with coloraturas on "purify", which may stand for a purifying fire. The movement is a parody of ''Quel fior che all'alba ride'' (HWV 192, July 1741).{{r|compositionslist}}{{r|Shaw 1963}}

=== Scene 3 ===
After the rather general introduction, [[Structure of Handel's Messiah#Scenes|Scene 3]] addresses Isaiah's specific prophecy about the virgin birth of a Messiah by expanding more verses from different chapters of the prophet.

==== 8 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 08 behold, a virgin shall conceive.ogg|title=” Behold, a virgin shall conceive”|description=Performed by the MIT Concert Choir, William Cutter directing (0:22)}}
'''Behold, a virgin shall conceive'''

"Behold, a virgin shall conceive" ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Isaiah | chapter = 7 | verse = 14 }}) is rendered in a short alto recitative, to be "called Emmanuel", translated to "God&amp;nbsp;– with us", sung with a rest after "God". This very prophecy is quoted in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Matthew | chapter = 1 | verse = 23 }}).

==== 9 ====

'''O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion'''

As if the good news was spreading, the solo alto begins "O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion" ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Isaiah | chapter = 40 | verse = 9 }}), and is taken over by the chorus. It is the first music in a swinging 6/8 time. Coloraturas accent the words "mountain" and "glory", and the words "God" and "Lord" are set in long notes. The choir voices enter in imitation, as if gathering, but soon sing together, starting with "arise" ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Isaiah | chapter = 60 | verse = 1 }}) on a pronounced "ascending [[Perfect fourth|fourth]]"—a signal observed by musicologist Rudolf Steglich as a unifying motif of the oratorio.{{r|Luckett 1992}}

==== 10 ====

'''For behold, darkness shall cover the earth'''

In stark contrast, the bass sings the continuation in an accompagnato "For behold, darkness shall cover the earth" ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Isaiah | chapter = 60 | verse = 2 | range = –3 }}) on a background of the strings playing mysterious repeated [[Motif (music)|motif]]s in major and minor [[Major second|second]]s, until the text switches to "but the Lord shall arise" (which the voice presents as a melisma of two measures), followed by coloraturas on "glory" and an upward octave leap to proclaim in the end "and kings [to the brightness of thy rising]".

==== 11 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 11 the people that walked in darkness.ogg|title=” The people that walked in darkness”|description=Performed by the MIT Concert Choir, William Cutter directing (3:16)}}
'''The people that walked in darkness'''

Although the text "The people that walked in darkness" is taken from a different chapter of Isaiah ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Isaiah | chapter = 9 | verse = 2 }}), Handel treats the aria as a continuation of the accompagnato by similar motifs. The darkness is illustrated by the bass and the celli in [[unison]], starting with the seconds of the movement before and proceeding in uneven steps, carefully marked for irregular phrasing. On "have seen a great light", the melody begins to leap, and finally reaches on the word "light" a long high note which the voice holds, while the celli continue their movement. The next occurrence of "darkness" is a broken downward melisma. In the second verse of the text, the gloom of the beginning is intensified by similar unsupported figures on "shadow of death", but once more relieved by "upon them has the light shined", again with the voice singing independently. The aria is not da capo, but follows exactly the two verses from the Old Testament poetry, where the second verse typically parallels the thought of the first.

==== 12 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 12 for unto us a child is born.ogg|title=” For unto us a child is born”|description=Performed by the MIT Concert Choir, William Cutter directing (4:18)}}
'''For unto us a Child is born'''

The choir concludes the scene, telling the news of Christmas, the [[Nativity of Jesus|birth of a son]], "For unto us a Child is born", in Isaiah's words ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Isaiah | chapter = 9 | verse = 6 }}). Marked piano, the sopranos enter a fugue first, singing a delicate theme with many rests. Their [[countersubject]] to the tenors' entry is a shimmering coloratura for more than three measures. The words "and the government shall be upon his shoulders" appears in stately dotted rhythm, culminating in the names "Won-derful", "Coun-selor", "The Mighty God", "The Everlasting Father", "The Prince&amp;nbsp;– of Peace", with the shimmering coloratura in the strings. A second and third round of the development from the tender "child is born" to the proclamation "Prince of Peace" is crowned by the fourth round, with the theme in the bass and the countersubject in soprano and alto in parallel thirds.

&lt;!--this image displayed wider than 400px for clarity--&gt;
[[File:Handel Messiah - For Unto Us a Child is Born excerpt.JPG|center|600px]]

The movement is based on the first section of Handel's Italian cantata ''No, di voi non vo' fidarmi'' (HWV 189, July 1741),{{r|compositionslist}}{{r|Shaw 1963}} which had "originally expressed a distinctly secular kind of joy".{{r|Heighes 1997}}

[[File:The Annunciation to the Shepherds 1663 Abraham Hondius.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Annunciation to the Shepherds'', by [[Abraham Hondius]], 1663]]

=== Scene 4 ===
[[Structure of Handel's Messiah#Scenes|Scene 4]] is the only real scene of the oratorio: the [[annunciation to the shepherds]], and is taken from the [[Gospel of Luke]], {{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Luke | chapter = 2 | verse = 14}}.  This is an episode in the [[Nativity of Jesus]] described in the [[Bible]] in [[Luke 2]], in which [[angel]]s tell a group of [[shepherd]]s about the birth of [[Jesus]].  It is a common subject of [[Christian art]] and of [[Christmas carols]].

==== 13 ====
'''Pifa'''

The shepherds are introduced by an instrumental [[Pastorale]], the Pifa, which takes its name from the shepherd-bagpipers, or ''pifferare'', who played in the streets of Rome at Christmas time.{{r|Luckett 1992}}{{r|Keates 2007}} The music in C major and swinging 12/8 time gently rises and falls like a [[Lullaby|cradle song]] (i.e. lullaby).
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 13 pifa.ogg|title=” Pifa”|description=Performed by the MIT Concert Choir, William Cutter directing (1:14)|pos=left}}

{{Clear}}

==== 14 ====

'''There were shepherds abiding in the field'''

In a short recitative, the soprano tells "There were shepherds abiding in the field". Handel saved the soprano solo voice until this point in the narration, exactly as Bach had done in his ''[[Christmas Oratorio]]''.

==== 15 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 15 and the angel said unto them.ogg|title=” The angel said unto them”|description=Performed by the MIT Concert Choir, William Cutter directing (0:40)}}
'''And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them'''

Vivid string accompaniment, as of wings in action, illuminates the accompagnato "And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them" which is sung by the soprano. With "And the angel said unto them", the soprano delivers in simple recitative the message "Fear not". The upward fourth, followed by a rest, stresses the phrases "for behold", "good tidings", "for unto you" and ultimately "which is Christ".

==== 16 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 16 and suddenly there was with the angel.ogg|title=” Suddenly there was with the angel”|description=Performed by the MIT Concert Choir, William Cutter directing (0:20)}}

'''And suddenly there was with the angel'''

With "And suddenly there was with the angel", the soprano continues to tell of the arrival of "a multitude of the heav'nly host". Singing more fourths and rests on "And suddenly" and "praising God", the music is supported by an even more vibrant accompaniment of the violins.

==== 17 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 17 glory to god.ogg|title=” Glory to god”|description=Performed by the MIT Concert Choir, William Cutter directing (2:27)}}
'''Glory to God'''

Handel waited until the angels' song "Glory to God" to introduce the trumpets. He marked them as "da lontano e un poco piano" (from afar and somewhat quietly) and originally planned to place them offstage (in disparte), to create the effect of distance.{{r|Luckett 1992}}{{r|Burrows 1991}} In this initial appearance the trumpets appear without the regular timpani.&lt;!-- "a deliberate withholding of effect, leaving something in reserve for Parts II and III" according to Luckett.{{r|Luckett 1992}} --&gt;Handel's setting of the famous words is strikingly simple and effective: "Glory to God, glory to God in the highest" is sung by the high voices (soprano, alto and tenor), whereas "and peace on earth" is given to the low voices of tenor and bass in unison, with the bass dropping an [[octave]] for "on earth". In great contrast, "goodwill towards men" is sung in a fast sequence of entries in imitation, with the word "goodwill" on another upward fourth. The sequence is repeated, but this time all four voices sing "glory" and "peace", the first in a high register, then low again with the bass dropping an octave. After the song the angels disappear, [[Dynamics (music)#Gradual changes|diminuendo]], gradually thinned out in instrumentation, with more and more rests, and always rising.

=== Scene 5 ===

[[Structure of Handel's Messiah#Scenes|Scene 5]] summarizes the deeds of the Messiah on earth and the response of man. The text is compiled from [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]] (who saw [[Book of Zechariah#Chapter 9 to 14|God's providential dealings]]), Isaiah's [[Book of Isaiah#Structure|oracle of salvation for Israel]], and his vision of the [[Book of Isaiah|Shepherd]] (seen fulfilled by the Evangelist Matthew).

==== 18 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 18 rejoice greatly.ogg|title=” Rejoice greatly”|description=Performed by the MIT Concert Choir, William Cutter directing (4:47)}}
'''Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion'''

"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion" ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Zechariah | chapter = 9 | verse = 9 | range = –10 }}) is usually performed as a virtuoso coloratura aria of the soprano which might express any kind of great joy—as seen in an opera—although the original version is an utterly charming Baroque dance in 12/8 time. An upward fourth followed by a rest accents "Rejoice", and further repeats of the word are rendered as seemingly endless coloraturas. "Behold, thy King cometh unto thee" is given in dotted rhythm and is reminiscent of the French overture. The middle section tells in mellow movement "He is the righteous Saviour and he shall speak peace unto the heathen"—with "peace" repeated several times as a long note. Finally, a da capo seems to begin, but only the first entry of the voice is exactly the same, followed by even more varied coloraturas and embellishments to end the aria.

==== 19 ====

'''Then shall the eyes of the blind be open'd'''

In prophetic words of Isaiah, the alto (originally soprano) recitative relates the Saviour's actions: "Then shall the eyes of the blind be open'd ... and the tongue of the dumb shall sing" ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Isaiah | chapter = 35 | verse = 5 | range = –6 }}).

==== 20 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 20 he shall feed his flock.ogg|title=” He shall feed his flock”|description=Performed by the MIT Concert Choir, William Cutter directing (6:38)}}
'''He shall feed His flock like a shepherd'''

A summary of the Saviour's deeds is given in a compilation of words from both Isaiah and Matthew. The Old Testament part "He shall feed His flock like a shepherd" ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Isaiah | chapter = 40 | verse = 11 }}), is sung by the alto in music in 12/8 time which is reminiscent of the [[#13|Pifa]], but moving first down, then up. The New Testament part, in the Gospel words of Jesus, are changed to the third person "Come unto Him, all ye that labour" ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Matthew | chapter = 11 | verse = 28 | range = –29 }}). The soprano sings the same melody, but elevated by a fourth from F major to B flat major. Handel originally wrote the entire aria for soprano solo in B flat.

==== 21 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 21 his yoke is easy.ogg|title=” His yoke is easy”|description=Performed by the MIT Concert Choir, William Cutter directing (3:31)}}
'''His yoke is easy'''

Matthew's gospel continues "My yoke is easy, and my burden is light", however for the closing choral movement of Part I, the words are changed to "His yoke is easy, His burden is light". Light and easy-going is the theme of a fugue, drawn from the duet for two sopranos "Quel fior che alla'ride" (HWV 192, July 1741).{{r|compositionslist}}{{r|Shaw 1963}} "His yoke" is again set as an upward fourth, and "easy" is a playful coloratura. The texture is intensified to the end, when all proclaim as a solemn statement "and His burden is light".

== In the News ==

The extensive 2 day Mool Nanakshahi Calendar Implementation Conference in Chicago detailed the significance of the changes.  Several scholars and topics on this topic lead the presentations and discussions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/naperville-sun/community/chi-ugc-article-sikh-religious-society-organizes-two-day-con-2017-11-18-story.html|title=The Chicago Tribune|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Native American Church''' ('''NAC'''), also known as '''Peyotism''' and '''Peyote Religion''', is a [[Native American religion]] that teaches a combination of traditional [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] beliefs and [[Christianity]], with sacramental use of the [[entheogen]] [[peyote]].&lt;ref name=altreligion/&gt; The religion originated in the [[U.S. State]] of [[Oklahoma]] in the late nineteenth century after peyote was introduced to the southern [[Great Plains]] from Mexico.&lt;ref name=altreligion&gt;{{cite web|url=http://altreligion.about.com/od/alternativereligionsaz/p/Peyote-And-The-Native-American-Church.htm|title=Peyote and the Native American Church|author=Catherine Beyer|work=About.com Religion &amp; Spirituality|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/jms089/Z-Unpublished%20Work/Shields-Christ%20&amp;%20Cactus.pdf {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620051155/http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/jms089/Z-Unpublished%20Work/Shields-Christ%20%26%20Cactus.pdf |date=20 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/405965/Native-American-Church|title=Native American Church|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is the most widespread indigenous religion among Native Americans in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, with an estimated 250,000 adherents as of the late twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/society/native-american-church.html|title=Native American Church|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrs.vcu.edu/profiles/NativeAmericanChurch.htm|title=World Religions &amp; Spirituality - Native American Church|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402103722/http://www.wrs.vcu.edu/profiles/NativeAmericanChurch.htm|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/nachurch.htm |title=University of Virginia Library |publisher=Religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu |date=2006-09-07 |accessdate=2011-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214012458/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/nachurch.htm |archivedate=14 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csp.org/communities/docs/fikes-nac_history.html |title='A Brief History of the Native American Church' |publisher=CSP |date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the peyote religion ==
[[File:Peyote road.jpg|thumb|left|Peyote road]]
[[File:TCMI Peyote set.jpg|thumb|left|A peyote set such as this is used by the medicine man during the peyote ritual.]]
[[File:Peyote ceremony tipi.jpg|thumb|left|Peyote ceremony tipi]]
Many denominations of mainstream Christianity made attempts to convert Native Americans to Christianity in Indian Country. These efforts were successful for many Native American tribes reflect Christian creed, including the Native American Church. Although conversion to Christianity was a slow process, the tenets of the Native American Church were readily accepted.&lt;ref name=plains/&gt;

Originally formed in the state of Oklahoma, the Native American Church is monotheistic, believing in a supreme being, called the [[Great Spirit]].&lt;ref name=altreligion/&gt; The tenets of the Native American Church regard "[[peyote]]" as a sacred and holy sacrament and use it as a means to communicate with the Great Spirit ([[God in Christianity|God]]).&lt;ref name=plains/&gt;

== Ceremony and roles ==
Followers of the Native American Church have differing ceremonies, celebrations, and ways of practicing their religion. For example, among the Teton, the Cross Fire group uses the Bible for sermons, which are rejected by the Half Moon followers, though they each teach a similar Christian morality.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; Ceremonies commonly last all night, beginning Saturday evening and ending early Sunday morning. Scripture reading, prayer, singing, and drumming are included.&lt;ref name=altreligion/&gt; In general, the Native American Church believes in one supreme God, the [[Great Spirit]].

Ceremonies are generally held in a [[tipi]] and require a priest, pastor, or elder to conduct the service.&lt;ref name=plains/&gt; The conductor is referred to as the Roadman. The Roadman is assisted by a Fireman, whose task is to care for the holy fireplace, being sure that it burns consistently all night. The Roadman may use a prayer staff, a beaded and feathered gourd, a small drum, cedar, and his eagle feather as a means for conducting services. The Roadman's wife or other female relative prepares four sacramental foods and the "second breakfast" that are part of the church services. Her part takes place very early, between 4:30 and 5:00 in the morning. The four sacramental foods are water, shredded beef or "sweet meat", corn mush, and some version of berry. To counterbalance the bitterness of the peyote consumed during the services, the sweet foods were added later. The second breakfast is like any other breakfast. It generally includes boiled eggs, toast, hash brown potatoes, coffee, and juice. This meal is served well after sunrise and just prior to the closing of the church services.

Church services are not regular Sunday occurrences but are held in accordance with special requests by a family for celebrating a birthday, or for a memorial or funeral service. Services begin at sundown on either a Friday or Saturday evening and end at sunrise. Thus, a participant "sits up" all night, giving up a full night's rest as part of a small sacrifice to the Great and [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]] and [[Jesus in Christianity|his Son]].

The church services culminate in a feast for the whole community the following day. Because peyote is a stimulant, all of the participating members are wide awake, so they, too, attend the feast. The need for sleep is generally felt in the late afternoon, particularly after the feast. Gifts are given to the Roadman and all his helpers by the sponsoring family at the feast to show deep appreciation for all his hard work.”&lt;ref name=plains/&gt;

Common reasons for holding a service include: the desire to cure illness, birthday celebrations, Christian holidays, school graduations, and other significant life events.&lt;ref name=okhistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=NA015|title=Native American Church - The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture|website=www.okhistory.org|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Persecution and law ==
As the United States government became more involved in the control of drugs, the Native American Church faced possible legal issues regarding their use of the substance.&lt;ref name=altreligion/&gt; The Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978, also called the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]], was passed to provide legal protection for the Church’s use of peyote.&lt;ref name=plains&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.rel.036|title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains - NATIVE AMERICAN CHURCH|website=plainshumanities.unl.edu|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy over peyote resulted in its legal classification as a controlled drug. Thus, only card-carrying members of the Native American Church are allowed to transport, possess, and use peyote for religious purposes.&lt;ref name=plains/&gt;

The [[Neo-American Church]] tried to claim LSD and marijuana as sacraments, seeking protection similar to that afforded to peyote use by the Native American Church. The courts ruled against them.

== Influential people ==
[[Quanah Parker]] is the individual most associated with the early history of Peyotism and the Native American Church. Other prominent figures in its development include Chevato, [[Jim Aton]], [[John Wilson (Caddo)|John Wilson]], and Jonathan Koshiway. These people, and many others, played important roles in the introduction and adoption of the Native American Church.&lt;ref name=okhistory/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26740">'''Open Orthodoxy''' is a form of [[ Judaism]] that emphasizes intellectual openness, a spiritual dimension, a broad concern for all Jews, and a more expansive role for women.&lt;ref name="GRosenblatt"/&gt; The term was coined in 1997 by [[Avi Weiss]], who views ''[[halakha]]'' as being more flexible than his more traditional counterparts.

==Overview==
Weiss's desire for a Judaism that is more inclusive and open-minded than the prevailing norms led him to found new learning institutions to train clergy who would be able to employ this new vision: [[Yeshivat Chovevei Torah|Yeshivat Chovevei Torah Rabbinical School]] (YCT) to train new [[rabbi]]s who will be "open, non-judgmental, knowledgeable, empathetic, and eager to transform Orthodoxy into a movement that meaningfully and respectfully interacts with all Jews, regardless of affiliation, commitment, or background"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yctorah.org/about/|title=About|website=www.yctorah.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, later, [[Yeshivat Maharat]] to train women clergy.

In striving for a more 'liberal' Orthodox Judaism, Weiss was required to clarify the differences between the Orthodox and non-Orthodox movements within Judaism. He states that all Orthodox Judaism, including Open Orthodoxy, fundamentally differs from [[Conservative Judaism]] in three areas.
# Orthodox Jews believe that the [[Torah]] was given by God at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] in its current form.
# Orthodoxy believes that "legal authority is cumulative, and that a contemporary ''[[posek]]'' [decider] can only issue judgments based on a full history of Jewish legal precedent", whereas Conservative Jews believe "precedent provides illustrations of possible positions rather than binding law. Conservatism, therefore, remains free to select whichever position within the prior history appeals to it".
# Orthodoxy is characterized by ritually-observant members who "meticulously keep [[Shabbat]] (the Sabbath), [[Kashrut]] (the Dietary Laws), [[Niddah|Taharat ha-Mishpaha]] (the Laws of Family Purity), and [[Jewish services|pray]] three times a day", whereas Conservative Judaism "is generally not composed of ritually observant Jews. Thus, only in our community if a 'permissive custom' is accepted, can it be meaningful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Open+orthodoxy!+A+modern+Orthodox+rabbi's+creed.-a020583577 | title =Open orthodoxy! A modern Orthodox rabbi's creed |work=Judaism: A Journal of Jewish Life &amp; Thought|publisher=[[American Jewish Congress]]|date=Fall 1997|last=Weiss |first=Avi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yeshivat Chovevei Torah==
In 1999 Weiss founded [[Yeshivat Chovevei Torah|Yeshivat Chovevei Torah Rabbinical School]] (YCT), which is currently located in the [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] section of the [[The Bronx|Bronx]], New York. Following its opening as a [[yeshiva]], a rabbinical school was opened in September 2000 with its first class of seven students. Since its inception, YCT has described itself as an Open Orthodox institution, and its mission statement made heavy use of the term its founder Weiss had coined.&lt;ref name="Jewish Week"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/closing-a-chapter-on-open-orthodoxy/|title=Closing A Chapter On ‘Open Orthodoxy’|work=Jewish Week|access-date=2017-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversies over YCT came to a head when in 2006 YCT applied for membership in the [[Rabbinical Council of America]], the rabbinical body affiliated with the [[Orthodox Union]], the largest North American Modern and Centrist Orthodox body. YCT subsequently withdrew their application when it became apparent that the application would be denied.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c36_a1421/News/New_York.html Opening Up Orthodox Judaism]" [[The Jewish Week]], December 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ordination of women ==
In May 2009, Weiss announced the opening of Yeshivat Maharat, a new school to train women as 'Maharat', an acronym for the Hebrew מנהיגה הלכתית רוחנית תורנית (halakhic, spiritual, and Torah leader), a title he created for a female version of a rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.jta.org/telegraph/article/2009/05/18/1005240/new-program-to-train-orthodox-women-as-non-rabbis |title=New program to train Orthodox women as non-rabbis |date=May 18, 2009 |last=Harris |first=Ben |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |publisher=blogs.jta.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717140922/http://blogs.jta.org/telegraph/article/2009/05/18/1005240/new-program-to-train-orthodox-women-as-non-rabbis |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school's  mission, according to its website, is "to train Orthodox women as spiritual leaders and halakhic authorities" in a four-year full-time course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://yeshivatmaharat.org/| title=Yeshivat Maharat}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sara Hurwitz]] was appointed dean of Yeshivat Maharat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hillel.harvard.edu/events/2010/03/03/evening-rabbah-sarah-hurwitz|title=An Evening with Rabbah Sarah Hurwitz|publisher=hillel.harvard.edu|accessdate=April 15, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817220326/http://hillel.harvard.edu/events/2010/03/03/evening-rabbah-sarah-hurwitz|archivedate=August 17, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 16, 2013 the first class of female maharats graduated from Yeshivat Maharat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://forward.com/articles/178926/orthodox-schism-over-role-of-women-widens-after-gr/?p=all | title=Orthodox Schism Over Role of Women Widens After Graduation of Maharats| last= Cohen |first=Anne | date=June 20, 2013| accessdate=August 7, 2013| work=The Jewish Daily Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009 Weiss [[Semichah|ordained]] Sara Hurwitz as rabbi, giving her the title of ''Maharat''.&lt;ref name="GRosenblatt"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/editorial_opinion/gary_rosenblatt/between_rav_and_hard_place| title=Between A Rav And A Hard Place| last=Rosenblatt |first=Gary |date=June 26, 2009| accessdate=April 15, 2011| work=The Jewish Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first formally ordained Orthodox woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://heebmagazine.com/rabba-sara-hurwitz-rocks-the-orthodox|title="Rabba" Sara Hurwitz Rocks the Orthodox |date=March 10, 2010 | author=StevenM | work=Heeb | accessdate=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010 Weiss announced that Hurwitz would henceforth be known by the title of "Rabba". The move sparked widespread criticism in the Orthodox world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/blogs/route_17/agudah_avi_weiss_shul_not_orthodox|title=Agudah: Avi Weiss Shul Not Orthodox|last=Mark|first=Jonathan|date=March 9, 2010|work=The Jewish Week|accessdate=January 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Agudath Israel of America|Agudath Israel Council of Torah Sages]] issued a public statement suggesting that Weiss should no longer be considered Orthodox, declaring that "these developments represent a radical and dangerous departure from Jewish tradition and the [[Masoretic Text|mesoras haTorah]], and must be condemned in the strongest terms. Any congregation with a woman in a rabbinical position of any sort cannot be considered Orthodox."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.jewishjournal.com/nation/article/rabbi_condemned_for_ordaining_woman_20100226|title=Rabbi condemned for ordaining woman|date=February 26, 2010|work=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]] |accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors circulated in the Jewish press that RCA considered expelling Weiss. Under pressure from the RCA, Weiss pledged not to ordain anybody else "rabba", although Hurwitz retains the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.jta.org/telegraph/article/2010/03/05/1010943/avi-weiss-no-more-rabbas| title=Avi Weiss: No more rabbas| date=March 5, 2010| last=Eden| first=Ami| publisher=JTA| accessdate=April 6, 2013| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420075116/http://blogs.jta.org/telegraph/article/2010/03/05/1010943/avi-weiss-no-more-rabbas| archivedate=April 20, 2010| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterwards, the RCA passed a resolution praising the increased Torah education of women in the Orthodox world encouraging "halachically and communally appropriate professional opportunities" for them, but stating: "We cannot accept either the ordination of women or the recognition of women as members of the Orthodox rabbinate, regardless of title."&lt;ref name="moment"&gt;{{cite news | title=Do 1 Rabba, 2 Rabbis and 1 Yeshiva = a New Denomination?| last= Breger |first=Sarah | date= November–December 2010| work= [[Moment Magazine]] |accessdate= July 31, 2013 | url= http://www.momentmag.com/do-1-rabba-2-rabbis-and-1-yeshiva-a-new-denomination/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a definitive RCA ruling issued in October 2015 that women may not be ordained, hired as rabbinical clergy nor titled as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Resolution: RCA Policy Concerning Women Rabbis|url=http://www.rabbis.org/news/article.cfm?id=105835|website=Rabbinical Council of America|accessdate=12 April 2018|date=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable others===
In 2015 Yaffa Epstein was ordained as Rabba by Yeshivat Maharat, which Weiss founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yeshivatmaharat.org/class-of-2015/|title=Class of 2015|work=Yeshivat Maharat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2015, [[Lila Kagedan]] was ordained as rabbi by that same organization, which made her their first graduate to take the title rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjnews.com/living-jewish/jewish-learning/why-orthodox-judaism-needs-female-rabbis|title=Why Orthodox Judaism needs female rabbis|author=Rabbi Lila Kagedan|date=25 November 2015|work=The Canadian Jewish News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 [[Lila Kagedan]] became the first female clergy member hired by an Orthodox synagogue while using the title "rabbi."&lt;ref&gt;''The Forward'' [http://forward.com/sisterhood/328427/first-woman-orthodox-rabbi-is-hired-by-synagogue/ First Woman Orthodox Rabbi Hired by Synagogue], January 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jta.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2016/01/11/news-opinion/united-states/nj-orthodox-shul-announces-hire-of-woman-using-rabbi-title|title=NJ Orthodox shul announces hire of woman using ‘rabbi’ title|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishpressnewsbriefs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/rabbi-lila-kagedan-first-female-rabbi-at-orthodox-shul-in-melbourne/2016/03/21/|title=The Jewish Press  »   » Rabbi Lila Kagedan, First Female Rabbi at Orthodox Shul in Melbourne|author=Jewish Press News Briefs|work=The Jewish Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clergy - Walnut"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walnutstreetsynagogue.com/clergy/ |title=Clergy - Walnut |publisher=Walnutstreetsynagogue.com |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred when Mount Freedom Jewish Center in New Jersey, which is Open Orthodox, hired Kagedan to join their "spiritual leadership team."&lt;ref name="jta.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishpressnewsbriefs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clergy - Walnut"/&gt; In 2018 Dina Brawer, born in Italy but living in Britain, was ordained by Yeshivat Maharat and thus became Britain's first female Orthodox rabbi; she chose the title  Rabba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfisz |first=Francine |url=http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/dina-brawer-becomes-uks-first-female-orthodox-rabbi/ |title=Dina Brawer becomes UK’s first female Orthodox rabbi &amp;#124; Jewish News |publisher=Jewishnews.timesofisrael.com |date= |accessdate=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yeshivatmaharat.org/class-of-2018/ |title=Class of 2018 — Yeshivat Maharat |publisher=Yeshivatmaharat.org |date= |accessdate=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthodox response==
Many traditional rabbis within Orthodox Judaism opposed Weiss' new approach with Orthodox opposition to Weiss' views, community&lt;ref name="stop_announce_gay"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sales|first1=Ben|title=Liberal Orthodox synagogue will stop announcing LGBT weddings after OU complains|url=https://www.jta.org/2017/12/13/news-opinion/united-states/liberal-orthodox-synagogue-will-not-announce-lgbt-weddings-following-complaint|accessdate=12 April 2018|publisher=Jewish Telegraph Agency|date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and institutions (both YCT&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heilman|first1=Uriel|title=Agudath Israel condemns Chovevei Torah for multidenominational roundtable|url=https://www.jta.org/2013/09/30/life-religion/agudath-israel-condemns-chovevei-torah-for-multidenominational-roundtable|accessdate=12 April 2018|publisher=Jewish Telegraph Agency|date=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Yeshivat Maharat) growing over time. Open Orthodoxy and its proponents have met with harsh criticism and disapproval from within Orthodoxy. Prominent leaders from both the [[Haredi Judaism|ultra-Orthodox]] and central or [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] communities have levelled harsh critiques of actions and beliefs of Open Orthodox individuals or institutions, stating that Open Orthodoxy is not Orthodox Judaism, but rather akin to the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and Conservative movements.

At the 92nd [[Agudath Israel of America]] Gala in 2014, the [[Novominsk (Hasidic dynasty)|Novominsker Rebbe]], [[Yaakov Perlow]] termed Open Orthodoxy "a new danger... that also seeks to subvert the sacred meaning of Judaism, that is steeped in heresy…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perlow|first1=Yaakov|title=Novominsker Rebbe Speech At the 92nd Agudath Israel Dinner|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGA3oZq9G3Y|website=YouTube|date=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A year and a half later, in November 2015, the Agudath Israel of America denounced moves to ordain women, and went even further, declaring Open Orthodoxy, Yeshivat Maharat, [[Yeshivat Chovevei Torah]], and other affiliated entities to be similar to other dissident movements throughout Jewish history in having rejected basic tenets of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hamodia.com/2015/11/03/moetzes-open-orthodoxy-not-a-form-of-torah-judaism/|title=Moetzes: ‘Open Orthodoxy’ Not a Form of Torah Judaism|work=Hamodia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Breach-in-US-Orthodox-Judaism-grows-as-haredi-body-rejects-Open-Orthodoxy-institutions-431929|title=Breach in US Orthodox Judaism grows as haredi body rejects ‘Open Orthodoxy’ institutions|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/323887/agudath-rabbis-declare-war-on-open-orthodoxy/|title=Avi Weiss Defends 'Open Orthodoxy' as Agudah Rabbis Declare War|author=Josh Nathan-Kazis|date=3 November 2015|work=The Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Conference of European Rabbis]] followed suit that same month, stating, "The Conference views with great pain the deviations from religious foundations emanating from the movement called 'Open Orthodoxy', and warns that those who act in this spirit, alumni of the aforementioned movement... will not be recognized by us as rabbis, with all that entails." Jonathan Guttentag of Manchester, UK, explained that by systematically testing the boundaries of normative Jewish practice, Open Orthodoxy "has pushed the envelope that bit far, and... led to positions which take its proponents outside the Orthodox umbrella."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/203309#.VkT23yspowc|title=European Rabbis: Open Orthodoxy 'outside the fold' - Jewish World - News  - Arutz Sheva|work=Arutz Sheva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar sentiments were echoed in a press release of a ruling by the [[Iggud HaRabbonim|Rabbinical Alliance of America]] on February 22, 2018, likening Open Orthodoxy to Reform and Conservative Judaism, and stating, "The clergy of this movement are espousing philosophies of the generation of the Sin of the Golden Calf."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rabbinical Alliance of America|title=Psak Halacha on Female Clergy|url=https://www.facebook.com/RAAIgud/posts/1551773701573441|website=FaceBook|date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent Central Orthodoxy leaders have also stated that Open Orthodox practices or beliefs are incongruent with Orthodox Judaism. These include [[Hershel Schacter]], [[Rosh Yeshiva]] at [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]] (RIETS), [[Yeshiva University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schachter|first1=Hershel|title=Impossible to call Open Orthodoxy Orthodox|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cWnTtXedKk|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schachter|first1=Hershel|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3IyXUxUSy4|title=Rav Schachter on Open Orthodoxy|date=20 March 2017|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Avrohom Gordimer, a rabbinic coordinator at OU Kosher&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordimer|first1=Avrohom|title=The Case Against "Open Orthodoxy"|url=https://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/13622|publisher=Israel National News|date=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordimer|first1=Avrohom|title=Open Orthodox Theology and Repentance|url=http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/open-orthodox-theology-and-repentance/|publisher=Times of Israel|date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

[[Steven Pruzansky]], rabbi of Congregation Bnai Yeshurun in [[Teaneck]], [[New Jersey]] and a trustee of the [[Rabbinical Council of America]] (RCA) on the Board of the [[Beth Din of America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=U.S. rabbi faces dissent for slamming Obama| last= Maltz |first=Judy | date=November 16, 2012 | work=Haaretz| accessdate= July 31, 2013 | url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-features/u-s-rabbi-faces-dissent-for-slamming-obama.premium-1.478303#}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that Weiss' approach closely resembles early 20th century American Conservative Judaism and in his opinion would more aptly be called "Neo-Conservative" rather than "Orthodox" Judaism. Concluding an opinion piece in [[Matzav|Matzav.com]] he states that "clarity and honesty at least demand that we recognize before our eyes the creation of a new movement in Jewish life outside the Orthodox world, one that we have seen before. It can be termed&amp;nbsp;... Neo-Conservatism. 'Open Orthodoxy' is a deceptive brand name, an advertising slogan, and an attempt to remain tethered to the Torah world to re-shape it from within, but far from the reality. The reality is that we are living through the rise of the Neo-Conservatives." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://matzav.com/open-orthodoxy-the-rise-of-the-neo-cons| title=Open Orthodoxy: The Rise of the Neo-Cons| last=Steven| first=Pruzansky| date=July 17, 2013|work=Matzav.com|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moshe Averick, a columnist for the Jewish magazine ''[[The Algemeiner Journal]]'' and author of ''Nonsense of a High Order: The Confused and Illusory World of the Atheist'', agrees with Pruzansky that Weiss has created a new Jewish movement in America, comparing him with [[Isaac Mayer Wise]] (founder of [[Reform Judaism]]) and [[Solomon Schechter]] (founder of Conservative Judaism in the United States). He compares Weiss's ordination of three women as Maharat on June 16, 2013, with the so-called [[Trefa Banquet]] of 1883, which marked the split between Reform and Traditional Judaism in America. Says Averick: "Weiss' movement, a form of Judaism that enthusiastically embraces the ideologies of feminism and liberal-progressive-modernism while coating it with a strong Orthodox flavor, could accurately be labeled as Ortho-Feminist Progressive Judaism," but "the term coined by Rabbi Steven Pruzansky&amp;nbsp;... Neo-Conservative Judaism&amp;nbsp;... has managed to fit neatly into the slot to the left of Orthodox Judaism and to the right of Conservative Judaism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.algemeiner.com/2013/07/18/american-jewry-at-the-crossroads-isaac-mayer-wise-solomon-schechter-and-now-avi-weiss-and-sara-hurwitz/ |title=American Jewry at the Crossroads: Isaac Mayer Wise, Solomon Schechter, and now...Avi Weiss and Sara Hurwitz | work = The Algemeiner |date=July 18, 2013 |accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, dozens of rabbis who defined themselves as "members in good standing or [who] identify with the Rabbinical Council of America", signed a letter arguing that Open Orthodoxy has "plunged ahead, again and again, across the border that divides Orthodoxy from neo-Conservatism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://orthodoxrabbis.wordpress.com/2013/10/30/statement-on-open-orthodoxy/|title=Statement on Open Orthodoxy|date=2013-10-30|work=Orthodox Rabbis|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Orthodox Union]] (OU), [[Rabbinical Council of America]] (RCA) and [[Young Israel|National Council of Young Israel]] have all in turn responded to Open Orthodoxy by severing their ties with the Open Orthodox institutions. The RCA does not [[Accreditation|accreditate]] the rabbinic qualifications of Yeshivat Chovevei Torah&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heilman|first1=Uriel|title=Is Yeshivat Chovevei Torah kosher enough?|url=https://www.jta.org/2012/09/07/news-opinion/the-telegraph/is-yeshivat-chovevei-torah-kosher-enough|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Yeshivat Maharat&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Resolution: RCA Policy Concerning Women Rabbis|url=http://www.rabbis.org/news/article.cfm?id=105835|website=Rabbinical Council of America|publisher=Rabbinical Council of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; graduates, the OU and Young Israel do not accept females as rabbinic clergy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fischer|first1=Dov|title=The OU joins RCA, Young Israel and Aguda on women clergy|url=https://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/20138|publisher=Israel National News|date=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Young Israel Synagogues no longer accept candidates with YCT accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eleff|first1=Zev|title=Symposium on Open Orthodoxy II|url=https://www.torahmusings.com/2015/08/symposium-on-open-orthodoxy-ii|website=Torah Musings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, in response to Open Orthodoxy new organizations have arisen within Orthodox Judaism as a result of the desire to actively and emphatically voice opposition or critiques against Open Orthodox positions or actions when the pre-existing Orthodox organizations have been slow to voice decisive opinions. These include the Coalition for Jewish Values (CJV)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=https://coalitionforjewishvalues.org/about-us/|website=Coalition for Jewish Values|accessdate=11 April 2018|quote=Modern Jewish movements which reject Jewish tradition are ill-qualified to determine or express authentically Jewish positions. The Rabbinic Fellows of the CJV have the necessary knowledge and expertise to correct the record.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Traditional Orthodox Rabbis of America (TORA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is TORA?|url=https://torarabbis.org/about/|website=Traditional Orthodox Rabbis of America|quote=Orthodoxy is portrayed too often in the Jewish and general media in ways that are incompatible or not fully representative of authentic Torah positions. As the general society rethinks and revisits traditional values while it contemplates new moral and ethical issues, it is our duty as rabbis to teach the truths of Torah to all who will listen.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response to Orthodox criticism==
According to [[Marc B. Shapiro|Marc Shapiro]], Avrohom Gordimer "has assumed the mantle of defender of the faith" and "sees his goal as exposing the non-Orthodox nature of Open Orthodoxy". Shapiro stated that to "deny them the simple courtesy of mentioning their names ... is in my opinion simply disgraceful".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://seforim.blogspot.com/2016/02/open-orthodoxy-and-its-main-critic-part.html|title=the Seforim blog: Open Orthodoxy and Its Main Critic, part 1|last=Shapiro|first=Marc|date=2016-02-08|website=the Seforim blog|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gordimer responded in an article in Cross Currents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2016/02/09/response-to-dr-marc-shapiro-good-shot-but-wrong-target/|title=Response to Dr. Marc Shapiro: Good Shot, but Wrong Target - Cross-Currents|date=2016-02-09|work=Cross-Currents|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ysoscher Katz, Chair, Department of Talmud, Yeshivat Chovevei Torah Rabbinical School, has also threatened legal action against Cross Currents despite claims on Facebook that he was open to these debates, if they "continue to publish Avrohom Gordimer’s libelous and unfounded accusations against me."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2015/10/12/a-communication-from-open-orthodoxy-with-reply/|title=A Communication from Open Orthodoxy|date=2015-10-12|work=Cross-Currents|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the negative stance of the Orthodox rabbinic community, [[Steven Bayme]], National Director of Jewish Communal Affairs at the [[American Jewish Committee]], sees Open Orthodoxy as the most authentic form of Modern Orthodoxy. In reference to the installation of [[Asher Lopatin]] as incoming president of [[Yeshivat Chovevei Torah]] Rabbinical School, Bayme said: "The event demonstrated the power of an Orthodoxy that is truly modern, in the sense of synthesizing modern scholarship and culture with Judaic tradition and learning, and an 'Open Orthodoxy', open to all Jews and open to hearing other viewpoints."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://blogs.forward.com/forward-thinking/185346/asher-lopatin-set-as-modern-orthodox-bridge/ |title= Asher Lopatin Set as Modern Orthodox 'Bridge' | work = The Jewish Daily Forward |publisher=forward.com|date=October 9, 2013 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YCT, itself, the brainchild of Weiss, however, ultimately reacted to the severe Orthodox disapproval by attempting - at least in name - to distance itself from the term 'Open Orthodoxy.' The school has removed all references to Open Orthodoxy on its website, replacing "open" with "modern." In an interview with the ''[[Jewish Week]]'' in August 2017, Asher Lopatin, the school's president said: “When they say, ‘Open Orthodox,’ I say, ‘We are Modern Orthodox. We are a full part of Modern Orthodoxy.’”&lt;ref name="Jewish Week"/&gt;

The [[Hebrew Institute of Riverdale]], where Weiss served as rabbi ("Senior Rabbi") until his retirement in 2015, and where he continues as "Rabbi in Residence," continues to define itself as "an open Orthodox synagogue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thebayit.org/|website=The Hebrew Institute of Riverdale|accessdate=15 April 2018|quote=The Hebrew Institute of Riverdale – The Bayit – is an open Orthodox synagogue serving the entire Jewish community by warmly embracing all Jews, regardless of affiliation, commitment, orientation or background.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[esoteric cosmology]], a '''plane''' is conceived as a subtle state, level, or region of reality, each plane corresponding to some type, kind, or category of [[being]].

The concept may be found in [[religious]] and [[esotericism|esoteric]] teachings—''e.g.'' [[Vedanta]] ([[Advaita Vedanta]]), [[Ayyavazhi]], [[shamanism]], [[Hermeticism]], [[Neoplatonism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Kashmir Shaivism]], [[Sant Mat]]/[[Surat Shabd Yoga]], [[Sufism]], [[Druze]], [[Kabbalah]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Anthroposophy]], [[Rosicrucianism]] ([[Esoteric Christianity|Esoteric Christian]]), [[Eckankar]], [[Ascended Master Teachings]], etc.—which propound the idea of a whole series of subtle planes or worlds or dimensions which, from a center, interpenetrate themselves and the physical [[planet]] in which we live, the [[planetary system|solar systems]], and all the physical structures of the universe. This interpenetration of planes culminates in the universe itself as a physical structured, dynamic and evolutive expression emanated through a series of steadily denser stages, becoming progressively more material and embodied.

The [[emanationism|emanation]] is conceived, according to esoteric teachings, to have originated, at the dawn of the universe's manifestation, in ''[[Great Architect of the Universe|The Supreme Being]]'' who sent out—from the unmanifested ''[[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]'' beyond comprehension—the dynamic force of creative energy, as ''sound-vibration'' ("the Word"), into the abyss of space. Alternatively, it states that this dynamic force is being sent forth, through the ages, framing all things that constitute and inhabit the universe.

==Origins of the concept==
The concept of planes of existence might be seen as deriving from shamanic and traditional mythological ideas of a vertical world-axis&amp;mdash;for example a cosmic [[mountain]], [[tree]], or pole (such as [[Yggdrasil]] or [[Mount Meru]])&amp;mdash;or a philosophical conception of a [[Great Chain of Being]], arranged metaphorically from [[God]] down to inanimate matter.

However the original source of the word ''plane'' in this context is the late [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] [[Proclus]], who refers to ''to platos'', "breadth", which was the equivalent of the 19th-century theosophical use. An example is the phrase ''en to psychiko platei''.&lt;ref&gt;Dodds, cited in Poortman, 1978, vol II, p.&amp;nbsp;54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptions in ancient traditions==
Directly equivalent concepts in Indian thought are [[loka]]s and bhuvanas. In [[Hindu]] cosmology, there are many lokas or worlds, that are identified with both traditional cosmology and states of [[meditation]].

Planes of existence may have been referred to by the use of the term corresponding to the word "egg" in English. For example, the Sanskrit term [[Brahmanda]] translates to "The entire creation" as opposed to the lazy inference "The Egg of Creation". Certain Puranic accounts posit that the Brahmanda is the superset of a set of fractal smaller Eggs, as is seen in the assertion of the equivalence of the Brahmanda and the [[Pinda (riceball)|Pinda]].&lt;ref&gt;Kak, Subhash: ''The Architecture of Knowledge''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Norse mythology gave the name "[[Ginnungagap]]" to the primordial "Chaos," which was bounded upon the northern side by the cold and foggy "[[Niflheim]]"—the land of mist and fog—and upon the south side by the fire "[[Muspelheim]]." When heat and cold entered into space which was occupied by Chaos or Ginnungagap, they caused the crystallization of the visible universe.

In the medieval West and Middle East, one finds reference to four worlds (''olam'') in [[Kabbalah]], or five in [[Sufism]] (where they are also called ''[[tanazzulat]]''; "descents"), and also in [[Isaac Luria|Lurianic Kabbalah]]. In Kabbalah, each of the four or five worlds are themselves divided into ten [[Sephirah|sefirot]], or else divided in other ways.

==Esoteric conceptions==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Charles Leadbeater Planes.jpg|thumb|300px|right| The planes according to [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]].]] --&gt;
The [[alchemy|alchemists]] of the [[Middle Ages]] proposed ideas about the constitution of the universe through a [[Hermeticism|hermetic]] language full of esoteric words, phrases, and signs designed to cloak their meaning from those not initiated into the ways of alchemy. In his "Physica" (1633), the Rosicrucian alchemist [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]], wrote: "Ad huc spiritum incognitum Gas voco" q.e., "This hitherto unknown Spirit I call Gas." Further on in the same work he says, "This vapor which I have called Gas is not far removed from the [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]] the ancients spoke of." Later on, similar ideas would evolve around the idea of aether.

In the late 19th century, the metaphysical term "planes" was popularised by the theosophy of [[H.P. Blavatsky]], who in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' and other writings propounded a complex cosmology consisting of seven planes and subplanes, based on a synthesis of Eastern and Western ideas. From theosophy the term made its way to later esoteric systems such as that of [[Alice Bailey]], who was very influential in shaping the worldview of the [[New Age]] movement. The term is also found in some Eastern teachings that have some Western influence, such as the cosmology of [[Sri Aurobindo]] and some of the later [[Sant Mat]], and also in some descriptions of Buddhist cosmology. The teachings of [[Surat Shabd Yoga]] also include several planes of the creation within both the [[macrocosm and microcosm]], including the Bramanda egg contained within the Sach Khand egg. [[Max Theon]] used the word "States" (French ''Etat'') rather than "Planes", in his [[cosmic philosophy]], but the meaning is the same.

The planes in Theosophy were further systematized in the writings of [[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Annie Besant]].

In the early 20th century, [[Max Heindel]] presented in ''[[The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception]]'' a cosmology related to the scheme of evolution in general and the evolution of the [[solar system]] and the [[Earth]] in particular, according to the Rosicrucians. He establishes, through the conceptions presented, a bridge between modern [[science]] (currently starting research into the subtler [[Etheric plane|''etheric'']] plane of existence behind the physical) and [[religion]], in order that this last one may be able to address man's ''[[spirituality|inner]]'' questions raised by scientific advancement.

The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] proposed that there are six planes of consciousness that must be experienced before one can attain [[God-realization (Meher Baba)|God-realization]] on the seventh plane: "Each definite stage of advancement represents a state of consciousness, and advancement from one state of consciousness to another proceeds side by side with crossing the inner planes. Thus six intermediate planes and states of consciousness have to be experienced before reaching the seventh plane which is the end of the journey and where there is final realisation of the God-state."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). ''Discourses''. '''2'''. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 22. {{ISBN|978-1-880619-09-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emanation vs. Big Bang==

However, in [[esoteric cosmology]] expansion refers to the [[emanation]] or unfolding of steadily denser planes or spheres from the spiritual summit, what Greek philosophy called ''[[Neo-Platonism#The One|The One]]'', until the lowest and most material world is reached.
	 
According to [[Rosicrucian]]s, another difference is that there is no such thing as empty or void space. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The space is Spirit in its attenuated form; while matter is crystallized space or Spirit. Spirit in manifestation is dual, that which we see as Form is the negative manifestation of Spirit--crystallized and inert. The positive pole of Spirit manifests as Life, galvanizing the negative Form into action, but both Life and Form originated in Spirit, Space, Chaos! On the other hand, Chaos is not a state which has existed in the past and has now entirely disappeared. It is all around us at the present moment. Were it not that old forms--having outlived their usefulness--are constantly being resolved back into that Chaos, which is also as constantly giving birth to new forms, there could be no progress; the work of evolution would cease and stagnation would prevent the possibility of advancement."&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''[[The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception]]'' (Chapter XI: [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rcc/rcceng11.htm The Genesis and Evolution of our Solar System]), 1909, {{ISBN|0-911274-34-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The planes==
In occult teachings and as held by psychics and other esoteric authors there are seven planes of existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetadnaactivation.com/medical2.html Seven Planes of Existence - Theta Medical Intuition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most occult and esoteric teachings are in agreement that seven planes of existence exist; however, many different occult and metaphysical schools label the planes of existence with different terminology.

===Physical plane===
The '''physical plane''' or '''physical universe''', in [[emanation]]ist metaphysics taught in [[Neoplatonism]], [[Hermeticism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], refers to the visible [[reality]] of [[space]] and [[time]], [[energy]] and [[matter]]: the physical universe in [[Occultism]] and [[esoteric cosmology]] is the lowest or [[density|densest]] of a series of planes of existence.

According to Theosophists, after the physical plane is the '''etheric plane''' and both of these planes are connected to make up the first plane.&lt;ref&gt;John Friedlander, Gloria Hemsher ''Psychic Psychology: Energy Skills for Life and Relationships'' 2011, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophy also teaches that when the [[physical body]] dies the [[etheric body]] is left behind and the [[soul]] forms into an [[astral body]] on the astral plane.&lt;ref&gt;Norman C. McClelland ''Encyclopedia of Reincarnation and Karma'' 2010, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychical researcher [[F. W. H. Myers]] proposed the existence of a “[[metetherial world]]”, which he wrote to be a world of images lying beyond the physical world. He wrote that apparitions have a real existence in the metetherial world which he described as a dream-like world.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, F. H. W. (1903). Human personality and its survival of death. London: Longmans.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astral plane===
[[File:Oresme Spheres crop.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''The astral spheres were thought to be planes of angelic existence intermediate between Earth and [[heaven]]'']]
The '''[[astral plane]]''', also known as the '''emotional plane''' is where consciousness goes after physical death. According to [[occult]] philosophy man possesses an [[astral body]]. The astral plane (also known as the astral world) was postulated by classical (particularly [[neo-Platonic|neoplatonic]]), medieval, oriental, and [[esotericism|esoteric]] philosophies and [[mystery cult|mystery religions]].&lt;ref name="G.R.S.Mead, 1919"&gt;G.R.S.Mead, ''The Doctrine of the Subtle Body in Western Tradition'', Watkins 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the world of the [[celestial spheres|planetary spheres]], crossed by the soul in its [[astral body]] on the way to being born and [[afterlife|after death]], and generally said to be populated by [[angel]]s, spirits, or other immaterial beings.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''The Republic'', trans. Desmond Lee, Harmondsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 19th and early 20th century the term was popularised by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and neo-[[Rosicrucianism]].

Throughout the [[Renaissance]], philosophers, [[Paracelsus|Paracelsians]], [[Rosicrucians]] and alchemists continued to discuss the nature of the astral world intermediate between Earth and the divine. The ''[[Barzakh]]'', ''olam mithal'' or intermediate world in [[Islam]] and the "World of ''[[Yetzirah]]''" in [[Lurianic Kabbalah]] are related concepts.

According to occult teachings the astral plane can be visited consciously through [[astral projection]], [[meditation]], and [[mantra]], [[near death experience|near-death experience]], [[lucid dreaming]], or other means.  Individuals that are trained in the use of the astral vehicle can separate their consciousness in the astral vehicle from the physical body at will.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Brennan, ''Astral Doorways'', Thoth Publications 1996 {{ISBN|978-1-870450-21-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Theosophist]] author [[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa]] wrote: "When a person dies, they become fully conscious in the astral body. After a certain time, the astral body disintegrates, and the person then becomes conscious on the mental plane." &lt;ref&gt;First Principles of Theosophy, pp. 139–140&lt;/ref&gt;

Occultist [[George Arundale]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the astral world exist temporarily all those physical entities, men and animals, for whom sleep involves a separation of the physical body for a time from the higher bodies. While we "sleep", we live in our astral bodies, either fully conscious and active, or partly conscious and semi-dormant, as the case may be, according to our evolutionary growth; when we "wake", the physical and the higher bodies are interlocked again, and we cease to be inhabitants of the astral world.” &lt;ref&gt;Curuppumullagē Jinarājadāsa ''First Principles of Theosophy'' Theosophical Publishing House, 1922, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some writers have claimed the astral plane can be reached by [[dream]]ing. [[Sylvan Muldoon]] and psychical researcher [[Hereward Carrington]] in their book ''The Projection of the Astral Body'' (1929) wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"When you are dreaming you are not really in the same world as when you are conscious – in the physical – although the two worlds merge into one another. While dreaming, you really are in the astral plane, and usually your astral body is in the zone of quietude."&lt;ref&gt;Sylvan J. Muldoon and Hereward Carrington ''Projection of the Astral Body'' Kessinger reprint edition, 2003, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Astral projection]] author Robert Bruce describes the astral as seven planes that take the form of planar surfaces when approached from a distance, separated by immense coloured "buffer zones".  These planes are endlessly repeating ruled [[Cartesian coordinate system]] grids, tiled with a single signature pattern that is different for each plane. Higher planes have bright, colourful patterns, whereas lower planes appear far duller. Every detail of these patterns acts as a consistent portal to a different kingdom inside the plane, which itself comprises many separate realms. Bruce notes that the astral may also be entered by means of long tubes that bear visual similarity to these planes, and conjectures that the grids and tubes are in fact the same structures approached from a different perceptual angle.

In his book ''[[wikisource:Autobiography of a Yogi|Autobiography of a Yogi]]'', [[Paramhansa Yogananda]] provides details about the astral planes learned from his resurrected guru [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri]].&lt;ref name="Paramhansa Yogananda 1946"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iN6fdZR6rXkC&amp;pg=PA400&amp;lpg=PA400|title=Autobiography of a Yogi (Google books)|author=Paramhansa Yogananda|year=1946|work=|publisher=The Philosophical Library, Inc|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yogananda reveals that nearly all individuals enter the astral planes after death. There they work out the seeds of past [[karma (Hinduism)|karma]] through astral incarnations, or (if their karma requires) they return to earthly incarnations for further refinement. Once an individual has attained the meditative state of [[nirvikalpa|nirvikalpa samadhi]] in an earthy or astral incarnation, the soul may progress upward to the "illumined astral planet" of Hiranyaloka.&lt;ref name="Paramhansa Yogananda 1946"/&gt; After this transitional stage, the soul may then move upward to the more subtle causal spheres where many incarnations allow them to further refine until [[Satcitananda|final unification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reluctant-messenger.com/yogananda/chapter_43.htm|title=Autobiography of a Yogi|author=Paramhansa Yogananda|year=1946|work=|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental plane===
The '''mental plane''', also known as the '''causal plane''' is the third lowest plane according to Theosophy. The mental plane is divided into seven sub-planes.

[[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the mental world one formulates a thought and it is instantly transmitted to the mind of another without any expression in the form of words. Therefore on that plane language does not matter in the least; but helpers working in the astral world, who have not yet the power to use the mental vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Leadbeater, The Inner Life, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Annie Besant]] wrote that "The mental plane, as its name implies, is that which belongs to consciousness working as thought; not of the mind as it works through the brain, but as it works through its own world, unencumbered with physical spirit-matter.&lt;ref&gt;Annie Besant ''The Ancient Wisdom: An Outline of Theosophical Teachings'' 1939, Chapter IV&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed description of the mental plane, along with the mental body, is provided by [[Arthur E. Powell]], who has compiled information in the works of Besant and Leadbeater in a series of books on each of the subtle bodies.

According to [[Hindu]] occultism the mental plane consists of two divisions, the lower division is known as heaven (''swarglok'') and the upper division is known as the causal plane (''maharlok'').&lt;ref&gt;Ravindra Kumar, Jytte Larsen ''The Kundalini book of living and dying: gateways to a higher consciousness'' 2004, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]] wrote:

:''"The causal plane is the world of light and blessedness, the highest of heavenly regions, extolled in the scriptures of all faiths. It is the foundation of existence, the source of visions, the point of conception, the apex of creation. The causal plane is the abode of Lord Siva and His entourage of Mahadevas and other highly evolved souls who exist in their own self-effulgent form--radiant bodies of centillions of quantum light particles."&lt;ref&gt;[[Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]], ''Dancing With Siva : Hinduism's Contemporary Catechism'', 1996, xxxv, 1008 p., ill., Sixth Edition, First Printing, 2003 Himalayan Academy [http://himalayanacademy.com/resources/books/dws/ online]&lt;/ref&gt;''

[[Sri Aurobindo]] developed a very different concept of the mental plane, through his own synthesis of Vedanta (including the Taittiriya Upanishad), Tantra, Theosophy, and [[Max Théon]] ideas (which he received via [[Mirra Alfassa|The Mother]], who was Theon's student in occultism for two years).  In this cosmology, there are seven cosmic planes, three lower, corresponding to relative existence (the [[Physical (Sri Aurobindo)|Physical]], [[Vital (Sri Aurobindo)|Vital]], and [[Mental (Sri Aurobindo)|Mental]]), and four higher, representing infinite divine reality (''[[The Life Divine|Life Divine]]'' bk.1 ch.27)  The Aurobindonian Mind or Mental Plane constitutes a large zone of being from the mental vital to the [[Overmind (Sri Aurobindo)|overmental]] divine region (''[[Letters on Yoga]]'', Jyoti and Prem Sobel 1984), but as with the later Theosophical concept it constitutes an objective reality of sheer mind or thought.

===Buddhic plane (also known as unity plane)===
The ''buddhic plane'' is described as a realm of pure [[consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Joshua David Stone, Janna Shelley ''A Beginner's Guide to the Path of Ascension'' p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; According to Theosophy the buddhic plane exists to develop buddhic consciousness which means to become unselfish and solve any problems with the ego.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Leadbeater ''Inner Life'' Kessinger reprint edition, 2003, p.226&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Leadbeater]] wrote that in the buddhic plane man casts off the delusion of the self and enters a realization of unity.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Leadbeater ''The Masters and the Path'' 2007, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Annie Besant]] defined the buddhic plane as

&lt;blockquote&gt;Persistent, conscious, spiritual awareness. This is the full consciousness of the buddhic or intuitional level. This is the perceptive consciousness which is the outstanding characteristic of the Hierarchy. The life focus of the man shifts to the buddhic plane. This is the fourth or middle state of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Bailey ''The Rays and the Initiations'' 1971, p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Sri Aurobindo]] calls the level above the mental plane the [[Supermind (Integral thought)|supermind]].&lt;ref&gt;Madis Senner ''The Way Home: Making Heaven on Earth'' 2009, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual plane===
{{Expand section|date=January 2013}}
[[George Winslow Plummer]] wrote that the ''spiritual plane'' is split into many sub-planes and that on these planes live spiritual beings who are more advanced in development and status than ordinary man.&lt;ref&gt;George Winslow Plummer ''Mercury: An Official Organ of the Societas Rosicruciana in America 1916-1921'' Kessinger reprint edition, 1998, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] teachings the goal of the spiritual plane is to gain spiritual knowledge and experience.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond T. Kranyak ''Metaphysical Secrets for Health and Success in Life'' 2009, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divine plane===
According to some occult teachings, all [[souls]] are born on the ''divine plane'' and then descend down through the lower planes; however souls will work their way back to the divine plane.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Poinsot ''Complete Book of the Occult and Fortune Telling'' Kessinger reprint edition, 2003, p. 472&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The encyclopedia of occult sciences'', R. M. McBride and company, 1939, p. 472&lt;/ref&gt; On the divine plane souls can be opened to conscious communication with the sphere of the divine known as the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] and receive knowledge about the nature of reality.&lt;ref&gt;John Hamlin Dewey ''New Testament of Occultism'' Kessinger reprint edition, 2003, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rosicrucianism]] teaches that the divine plane is where [[Jesus]] dwelt in [[Christ consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;The Rosicrucian Digest September 1932, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logoic plane (also known as monadic plane)===
The ''logoic plane'' is the highest plane, it has been described as a plane of total oneness, the "I AM Presence". [[Joshua David Stone]] describes the plane as complete unity with [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Joshua David Stone, Janna Shelley Parker ''A Beginner's Guide to the Path of Ascension'' 1998, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''monadic plane (hyperplane)'' or continuum/universe, enclosing and interpenetrating grosser hyperplanes, respectively is the plane in which the monad or holy spirit or oversoul is said to exist.

==31 planes==
{{main|Buddhist cosmology}}
In Buddhism, the world is made up of 31 planes of existence that one can be reborn into, separated into 3 realms.

==The Summerland==
{{main|The Summerland}}
The Summerland is the name given by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]], [[Spiritualists]], [[Wicca]]ns, and some earth-based [[paganism (contemporary)|contemporary pagan]] religions to their conceptualization of existence on a plane in an [[afterlife]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativespirit.net/spiritworld/ The Spirit World Descriptions by Early Spiritualists by Barbara N. Starr]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emanuel Swedenborg]] (1688–1772) inspired [[Andrew Jackson Davis]] (1826–1910), in his major work ''The Great Harmonia'' to say that Summerland is the pinnacle of spiritual achievement in the afterlife; that is, it is the highest level, or ''sphere'', of the afterlife we can hope to enter. The common portrayal of the Summerland is as a place of rest for souls after or between their earthly incarnations. Some believe [[spirits]] will stay in the Summerland for an eternal afterlife, though others believe after an amount of time some spirits will [[reincarnate]]. The Summerland is also envisioned as a place for recollection and reunion with deceased loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fst.org/sptwld1.htm Life in the Spirit World: Part One General Introduction By Rev. Simeon Stefanidakis]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the name suggests, it is often imagined as a place of beauty and peace, where everything people hold close to their hearts is preserved in its fullest beauty for eternity. It is envisioned as containing wide (possibly eternal) fields  of rolling green hills and lush grass. In many ways, this ideology is similar to the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] view of [[Annwn]] as an afterlife realm. The Summerland is also viewed as the place where one goes in the afterlife in traditions of [[Spiritualism]] and Theosophy, which is where Wicca got the term.

In Theosophy, the term "Summerland" is used without the definite article "the". Summerland, also called the Astral plane Heaven, is depicted as where [[soul]]s who have been good in their previous lives go between incarnations. Those who have been bad go to [[Hell]], which is believed to be located below the surface of the Earth and is on the astral plane and is composed of the densest astral matter; the Spiritual Hierarchy functioning within Earth functions on the etheric plane below the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W ''A Textbook of Theosophy'' 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed by Theosophists that most people (those at high levels of initiation) go to a specific Summerland that is set up for people of each religion. For example, [[Christians]] go to a Christian heaven, [[Jews]] go to a Jewish heaven, [[Muslims]] go to a Muslim heaven, [[Hindus]] goes to a Hindu heaven, Theosophists go to a Theosophical heaven, and so forth, each heaven being like that described in the [[scripture]]s of that religion. There is also a generic Summerland for those who were [[atheist]]s or [[agnostic]]s in their previous lives. People who belong to religions that don't believe in [[reincarnation]] are surprised to find out when they get to heaven that they will have to reincarnate again within a few dozen to a few hundred years. Each heaven is believed to be an extensive structure composed of astral matter located on the astral plane about three or four miles (5–6&amp;nbsp;km) above the surface of Earth, above that part of the world where the particular religion that the heaven is meant for is most predominant.

Theosophists also believe there is another higher level of heaven called [[Devachan]], also called the Mental plane Heaven, which some but not all souls reach between incarnations—only those souls that are more highly developed [[spirituality|spiritually]] reach this level, those souls that are at the first, second, and third levels of initiation. Devachan is several miles (around 10&amp;nbsp;km) higher above the surface of Earth than Summerland.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Inhabitants of the various planes==
Occult writers such as [[Geoffrey Hodson]], Mellie Uyldert, and [[Dora van Gelder]] had attempted to classify different spiritual beings into a hierarchy based on their assumed place and function on the planes of existence.

[[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] fundamentally described and incorporated his comprehension of intangible beings for Theosophy. Along with him there are various planes intertwined with the quotidian human world and are all inhabited by multitudes of entities. Each plane is purported as composed of discrete density of ''[[etheric plane|astral or ethereal matter]]'' and frequently the denizens of a plane have no discernment of other ones. Other Theosophical writers such as [[Alice Bailey]], a contemporary of Leadbeater, also gave continuousness to Theosophical concepts of ethereal beings and her works had a great impact over [[New Age]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Laderman, Luis D. León; ''Religion and American cultures: an encyclopedia of traditions, diversity, and popular expressions'' - Volume 3, 2003; p. 236. {{ISBN|1-57607-238-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael York, ''The emerging network: a sociology of the New Age and neo-pagan movements'', 1995; p. 66. {{ISBN|0-8476-8001-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She puts the nature spirits and devas as ethereal beings immersed in macro divisions of an interwoven threefold universe, usually they belong to the etheric, astral, or mental planes. The ethereal entities of the four kingdoms, Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, are forces of nature.

The Dutch writer [[Mellie Uyldert]], self-proclaimed clairvoyant, characterized the semblance and behavior of ethereal entities on the etheric plane, which, she said, hover above plants and transfer energy for vitalizing the plant, then nourishing themselves on rays of sunlight. She depicted them as asexual gender, and composed of [[etheric body|''etheric'' matter]].
They fly three meters over the ground, some have wings like butterflies while others only have a small face and an [[aura (paranormal)|aura]] waving graciously. Some are huge while others may have the size of one inch.&lt;ref&gt;Mellie Uyldert ''The psychic garden: Plants and their esoteric relationship with man'' Thorsons, 1980 {{ISBN|0-7225-0548-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quiritis''' was a [[Sabine]] (pre-[[Roman mythology|Roman]]) goddess of motherhood. She was often associated with protection. In later years, Quiritis was identified with the goddess [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], who was sometimes worshipped under the name Juno Quiritis (or Juno Curitis). Some scholars believe that Juno was in fact merely another version of Quiritis, although others say that the two are linked merely by borrowing.

Her name is believed to have derived from a Sabine word meaning "[[lance]]" or "[[spear]]", and she is often depicted holding that weapon (presumably in defence of someone or something). This is a feature that was incorporated into Juno's identity. Traditionally, Roman [[marriage]]s included a ritual where the bride's hair was cut or parted with a spear - some see this as the result of Juno's association with marriage, although other explanations for the ritual are given as well.

Juno Quiritis is said to have been the only deity worshipped by all thirty of the original ''curiae'' (political and military divisions) established by [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]]. There was a temple to Juno Quiritis on the [[Campus Martius]], an area where soldiers traditionally trained.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2833">'''Rajarishi''' (from [[Sanskrit]] "[[Rajan]]" a "[[King]]" + "[[Rishi]]" a "Saint" ) in [[Hinduism]] and [[Hindu mythology]], is a Royal Saint.

==Order==
A Rajarshi is a [[king]] who turned into a royal sage. A Rajarshi will not have to leave the kingship to become ''rishi'' as in the example of [[Vishwamitra]] (who later advanced to becoming a ''[[Brahmarishi]]'') but still while ruling the kingdom has reached a state of rishi and has attained self-realization.
They still perform the [[kshatriya]] responsibility, and remain similar to most [[rishis]], [[maharishis]] and [[brahmarishi]]s descendents in their level of spiritual knowledge. 
&lt;ref&gt; http://www.mythfolklore.net/india/encyclopedia/viswamitra.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

Namely there are four types of Rishis mentioned in Hinduism and Vedas.
# Rajarshi
# [[Maharishi]]
# [[Brahmarshi]]
# And, one Devarshi (Devarshi [[Narada|Narad]]).

== Reference in Hinduism ==
In Vedas and Holy scriptures of [[Hinduism|Hindusim]], the name and Rajarshi has its own meaning and it's widely being applied for few ancient historical Hindu Legends who always and still now stood as examples of sacrifices for achieving a greater cause for the humanity and the prevalent societies. 
There are the mention of namely two Rajarshi in [[Vedic period|Vedic]] History.
* Rajarshi [[Rishi Mudgal|Mudgal]]
* Rajarshi [[Vishwamitra]]
[[Rajarshi Mudgal]] wrote 1 [[Upnishad]] out of 108 Upnishads named Mudgalupnishad. Mudgalupnishad is of very special type and unique amongst all [[upanishads]] ever written. As it's mainly contains information and praises about [[Ganesha|Lord Ganesha]], and how to pray and perform [[Yajna]] and [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] of Lord Ganpati.

The great sage strongly believed in simple living high thinking and had a high level patience amongst other Rishis. That's why still today the persons belonged to Mudgal [[Gotra]] are considered highly ethical and had infinite patience in compare to average.

[[Rajarshi Mudgal]] was also been cited for the infamous curse on his wife. He cursed his wife that in next birth she will have Five Husbands. And due to that effect of his spell, his wife was born as [[Draupadi]], the daughter of King [[Drupada]] in her next birth.

The great sage Vishvamitra was also called Rajarshi who later went on to become Brahmarshi. 

Another famous figure named Rajarshi in somehow present era was [[Purushottam Das Tandon|Purusottam Das Tandon]]. He was the one who is regarded as the person to make Hindi the ''Official Language'' of Independent India. He was awarded [[Bharat Ratna]] (India's Highest Civilian Award) in year 1961.

'''Ratnākaraśānti''' (also known as '''Śāntipa''') (c. 1000 CE) was one of the eighty-four [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Mahasiddha|Mahāsiddhas]] and the chief debate-master at the monastic university of [[Vikramashila]]. At Vikramashila he was instructed by [[Naropa|Nāropa]],&lt;ref&gt;Tāranātha, Lama Chimpa and Alaka Chattopadhyaya (trans.). ''Tāranātha’s History of Buddhism in India'', pp. 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt; and taught both [[Atiśa]] and [[Maitripa|Maitrīpa]].&lt;ref&gt;Tatz, Mark. "Maitrī-pa and Atiśa," pp. 473-477.&lt;/ref&gt; His texts include several influential commentaries to Buddhist [[tantra]]s, as well as works of philosophy and logic.

Little else is known about his life; in the ''Biography of the Eighty-Four Siddhas'', [[Abhayadhatta]] records that "King Kapina" invited Ratnākaraśānti to [[Sri Lanka|Śrī Laṇka]] during the reign of the [[Pala Empire|Pāla]] king [[Devapala (Pala dynasty)|Devapāla]] (c. 810-850 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Abhayadhatta and Robinson, James (1979). ''Buddha's Lions: The Lives of the Eighty-Four Siddhas'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to [[Keith Dowman]], "As history of Śrī Laṇkā the legend is incomprehensible. There is no King Kapina in the lists of Siṇghala kings… [and] there is no evidence of a Śāntipa contemporary with the Pāla Emperor Devapāla."&lt;ref&gt;Dowman, Keith (1986). ''Masters of Mahamudra: Songs and Histories of the Eighty-four Buddhist Siddhas'', p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taranatha|Tāranātha]] provides a more realistic date, placing him during the reign of King Canaka (955-83 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Tāranātha, Lama Chimpa and Alaka Chattopadhyaya (trans.). ''Tāranātha’s History of Buddhism in India'', p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratnākaraśānti composed three commentaries to the [[Guhyasamaja|Guhyasamāja Tantra]], as well as commentaries to the [[Hevajra|Hevajra Tantra]] and the [[Mahamaya|Mahāmāyā Tantra]]. His exoteric works, generally written from a [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]] perspective, include several commentaries to the [[Prajnaparamita|Perfection of Wisdom]] literature, such as his ''Sāratamā'' and ''Pith Instructions for the Perfection of Wisdom'' (''Prajñāpāramitābhāvanopadeśa''). He is also the author of two commentaries to [[Śāntarakṣita|Śāntarakṣita's]] [[Madhyamakalamkara|Madhyamākalaṃkāra]], and a technical treatise on the formal logic of [[pramāṇa]] theory (the ''Antarvyāptisamarthana'').

Ratnākaraśānti was a [[Yogachara|Yogacara]] philosopher who defended the Alikākāravāda view of Yogacara as well as the compatibility of [[Madhyamaka]] with this Yogacara view.&lt;ref&gt;Komarovski, Yaroslav'', Visions of Unity: The Golden Paṇḍita Shakya Chokden’s New Interpretation of Yogācāra and Madhyamaka''. Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 2011, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jainism}}
'''''Samvara'''''  (''saṃvara'') is one of the ''[[Tattva (Jainism)|tattva]]'' or the fundamental reality of the world as per the [[Jain philosophy]]. It means stoppage—the stoppage of the influx of the material karmas into the soul consciousness. The karmic process in Jainism is based on seven truths or fundamental principles (''tattva'') of Jainism which explain the human predicament.&lt;ref name=soni&gt;{{cite journal | last =Soni | first =Jayandra | editor =E. Craig | title =Jain Philosophy | journal =Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy | publisher =Routledge | location =London | year =1998 | url =http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/F005SECT1 | accessdate =2008-03-05 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060722002023/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/F005SECT1 | archivedate =22 July 2006 | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the seven, the four influxs (''[[asrava|āsrava]]''), bondage (''bandha''), stoppage (''saṃvara'')  and release (''[[nirjara|nirjarā]]'')—pertain to the [[Karma in Jainism|karmic process]].&lt;ref name=soni/&gt;

==Philosophical overview==
''Saṃvara'' is the first step in the destruction of accumulated harmful karmas. The world or the ''[[Samsara (Jainism)|samsara]]'' is often described as an ocean and the soul as a boat trying to cross it and reach the shores of liberation. The boat is leaking i.e. karmic particles are getting attached to the soul. Hence the first step is to stop the leak and prevent new water from entering the boat. This is ''saṃvara''. Jains assert that emancipation is not possible as long as the soul remains unreleased from the bondage of these karmas. Release is made possible by ''saṃvara''; that is, the stopping of inflow of new karmas, and ''nirjarā''; the shedding of existing harmful karma through conscious efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Sanghvi | first =Sukhlal | title =Commentary on Tattvārthasūtra of Vācaka Umāsvāti | publisher =L. D. Institute of Indology | year =1974 | location =Ahmedabad |translator=K. K. Dixit |page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Means of ''saṃvara''==
''Samvara'' or stoppage of karmic influx is achieved through practice of:

#Five ''samitis'' or observing carefulness in movement, speaking, eating, placing objects and disposing refuse.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharya, H. S. (1976) pp.45–46&lt;/ref&gt;
#Ten ''dharmas'' or observation of good acts like – forgiveness, humility, straightforwardness, contentment, truthfulness, self-control, penance, renunciation, non-attachment and continence.&lt;ref name=hari46&gt;Bhattacharya, H. S. (1976) p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;
#''[[Anupreksha]]s'' or meditation on the truths of this universe.&lt;ref name=hari46/&gt;
#''Pariṣahajaya'', that is, a man on moral path must develop a perfectly patient and unperturbed attitude in the midst of trying and difficult circumstances.&lt;ref name=hari46/&gt;
#''Cāritra'', that is, endeavour to remain in steady spiritual practices.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharya, H. S. (1976) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

In current-day usage, the term  ''sanatana dharma'' is used to emphasize a "traditional” or ''sanatani'' ("eternalist") outlook in contrast to the socio-political Hinduism embraced by movements such as the [[Arya Samaj]].&lt;ref name="ref48zupul"&gt;{{Citation | title=Folk, Volumes 36-37 | author=Dansk etnografisk forening | publisher=Dansk etnografisk forening, 1995 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qM9KAAAAYAAJ | quote=''...

The phrase ''dharma sanātana'' does occur in classical [[Sanskrit literature]], e.g. in the  ''[[Manusmrti]]'' (4-138)&lt;ref name="manusmriti2345"&gt;{{Citation | title=Manusmriti (4-138) | url= | quote=''...

==Sanatanis as a denomination==
Since many reformist groups had the word ''Samaj'' (meaning ''society'') or were led by a ''sant'' (meaning ''saint''), ''Sanatanis'' are often held to be in contrast with ''Samajists'' and ''Santpanthis'' (meaning those who walk on the ''panth''/''path'' shown by their ''sant''/''saint'').&lt;ref name="ref70xaqif"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref64jirum"&gt;{{Citation | title=The Arya Samaj movement in South Africa | author=Thillayvel Naidoo | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1992 | isbn=978-81-208-0769-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2z1mnXSPmEC | quote=''...

Reformist denominations such as the Arya Samaj are often fundamentalist in their approach. The Arya Samaj regards the [[Vedas]] as infallible, revealed scripture, and rejects what it regards as non-Vedic innovations in Sanatani Hinduism.&lt;ref name="ref36lobaq"&gt;{{Citation | title=Social background of Indian nationalism | author=A.R.

These differences are often apparent in social practices. Arya Samaji weddings, for instance, are based on Vedic practice and tend to be simpler and shorter with a qualified individual of any caste-heritage conducting the wedding, whereas Sanatani weddings are longer, with more complex rituals and always involve an officiating Brahmin priest.&lt;ref name="ref82duxag"&gt;{{Citation | title=Glimpses of the Arya Samaj in Mauritius | author=Pahlad Ramsurrun | publisher=Sarvadeshik Prakashan Ltd., 2001 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ogRAQAAIAAJ | quote=''...

==Competition with other denominations==
Sanatanis and reformists (such as the [[Arya Samaj]], the [[Radha Soami]]s and the [[Ramakrishna Mission]]) have competed for adherents for more than a century, sometimes creating deep schisms in Hindu society, as in the case of [[South Africa]]n Hindus who were split between the Arya Samaj and Sanatanis.&lt;ref name="ref64jirum"/&gt; While the reformist groups were better organized initially, by the 1860s, a process of internal counter-reform was underway in Sanatani groups as well, and societies to propagate orthodox beliefs along modern lines emerged, such as Sanatan Dharm Rakshini Sabha in 1873.&lt;ref name="ref13baqeb"&gt;{{Citation | title=The life of a text: performing the Rāmcaritmānas of Tulsidas | author=[[Philip Lutgendorf]] | publisher=University of California Press, 1991 | isbn=978-0-520-06690-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=19zvfkwXyzUC | quote=''...

I do not disbelieve in murti puja." (Murti Puja means Idol Worship) (''[[Young India]]'': June 10, 1921)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36764">{{short description|pejorative term used for a Jewish person that holds antisemitic views}}
'''Self-hating Jew''' or '''self-loathing Jew''' is a [[pejorative]] term used for a [[Jew]]ish person who is alleged to hold [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] views.&lt;ref name= "Gilman"/&gt; Although similar accusations of being uncomfortable with one's Jewishness were already being made by groups of Jews against one another before Zionism existed as a movement, the concept gained widespread currency after [[Theodor Lessing]]'s 1930 book ''Der Jüdische Selbsthass'' ("Jewish Self-hatred"), which tried to explain the prevalence of Jewish intellectuals inciting antisemitism with their views toward [[Judaism]]. The term became "something of a key term of opprobrium in and beyond [[Cold War|Cold War-era]] debates about [[Zionism]]".&lt;ref name=reitter08/&gt;

==Description of phenomenon==
The expression "self-hating Jew" "is often used rhetorically to discount Jews who differ in their lifestyles, interests or political positions from their accusers".&lt;ref name="Finlay"/&gt; Finlay, a member of the Psychology Department at University of Surrey, distinguishes between "Jewish antisemitism" and "Jewish self-hatred," arguing that while the literature is full of examples of Jews who espoused antisemitism with statements dangerous and damning to all Jews, "whether this amounts to self-hatred is not easy to assess." Usage of [[self-hatred]] can also designate dislike or hatred of a group to which one belongs. The term has a long history in debates over the role of [[Israel]] in [[Jewish identity]], where it is used against Jewish [[Criticism of the Israeli government|critics of Israeli government policy]].&lt;ref name="Finlay"&gt;W. M. L. Finlay, "Pathologizing Dissent: Identity Politics, Zionism and the 'Self-Hating Jew'", ''[[British Journal of Social Psychology]]'', Vol. 44 No. 2, June 2005, pp. 201-222.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alvin H. Rosenfeld]], an academic author who does not use the term self-hatred, dismisses such arguments as disingenuous, referring to them as "the ubiquitous rubric 'criticism of Israel,'" stating that "vigorous discussion of Israeli policy and actions is not in question."&lt;ref name= "Rosenfeld"&gt;Alvin H. Rosenfeld, "Rhetorical Violence and the Jews," The New Republic, February 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Dershowitz]] limits the term self-hatred to extreme [[Jewish anti-Zionism|Jewish anti-Zionists]] who "despise anything Jewish, ranging from their religion to the Jewish state," saying it does not apply to all "Israel-bashers."&lt;ref name= "Dershowitz"&gt;Alan Dershowitz, "The Case for Israel," John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 2004, pg. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; The academic historian Jerald Auerbach uses the term Jewish self-loathing to characterize "Jews who perversely seek to bolster their Jewish credentials by defaming Israel."&lt;ref name= "Auerbach"&gt;Jerald Auerbach, "Jews Against Themselves by Edward Alexander (Review)," the Algemeiner, August 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural historian [[Sander Gilman]] has written, "One of the most recent forms of Jewish self-hatred is the virulent opposition to the existence of the State of Israel."&lt;ref name= "Gilman"&gt;Sander Gilman, "Jewish Self-Hatred: Anti-Semitism and the Hidden Language of the Jews," Baltimore:Johns Hopkins University Press 1986, pp. 361.&lt;/ref&gt; He uses the term not against those who oppose Israel's policy, but against Jews who are opposed to Israel's existence.  The concept of Jewish self-hatred has been described by [[Antony Lerman]] as "an entirely bogus concept",&lt;ref name=lermanhaa&gt;[[Antony Lerman]], "[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1020490.html Jews attacking Jews]", ''Ha'aretz'', 12 September 2008, accessed 13 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; one that "serves no other purpose than to marginalise and demonise political opponents",&lt;ref name=lerman&gt;Antony Lerman, ''Jewish Quarterly'', [http://www.jewishquarterly.org/issuearchive/article2366.html?articleid=432 "Jewish Self-Hatred: Myth or Reality?"], Summer 2008&lt;/ref&gt; who says that it is used increasingly as a personal attack in discussions about the "[[new antisemitism]]".&lt;ref name=lerman/&gt; Ben Cohen criticizes Lerman saying no "actual evidence is introduced to support any of this."&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;"Anthony Lerman Plays Politics with Antisemitism", The Propagandist, September 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Lerman recognizes the controversy whether extreme vilification of Israel amounts to antisemitism and says that antisemitism can be disguised as [[anti-Zionism]],&lt;ref name=lermanhaa/&gt;&lt;ref name=debates&gt;"Anti-Zionism and Antisemitism: Ben Cohen Debates Antony Lerman", The Propagandist, June 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; which is the concern of Rosenfeld and Gilman addressed above.

The sociologist [[Irving Louis Horowitz]] reserves the term for Jews who pose a danger to the Jewish community, using "Jewish self-hater" to describe the [[court Jew]] "who validates the slander (against Jews) as he attempts to curry the favor of masters and rulers."&lt;ref name= "Horowitz"&gt;Irving Louis Horowitz, "New Trends and Old Hatreds," Springer New York'' [[Society (journal)]]'', Vol. 43 No.1, November 2005, {{ISSN|0147-2011}} (Print) {{ISSNT|1936-4725}} (Online).&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Bernard Wasserstein]] prefers the term "Jewish anti-Semitism," which he says was often termed
Jewish self-hatred.&lt;ref name= "Wasserstein"&gt;Bernard Wasserstein, "On the Eve," Simon and Schuster 2012, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; He asks, "Could a Jew be an anti-Semite?" And responds, many Jews have "internalized elements of anti-Semitic discourse, succumbed to what Theodore Hamerow has called psychological surrender." Wasserstein goes on to say that self-hating Jews, "afflicted by some form of anti-Semitism were not so much haters of themselves as haters of 'other' Jews."

Jewish self-hatred has been described as a neurotic reaction to the impact of antisemitism by Jews accepting, expressing, and even exaggerating the basic assumptions of the [[antisemite]].&lt;ref name= "Lewis"&gt;Bernard Lewis, "Semites and Anti-Semites," W. W. Norton &amp; Company 1999, pp. 255-256.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===In German ===
The origins of terms such as "Jewish self-hatred" lie in the mid-nineteenth century feuding between German [[Orthodox Jews]] of the [[Wrocław|Breslau]] seminary and [[Reform Jews]].&lt;ref name=lerman/&gt; Each side accused the other of betraying Jewish identity,&lt;ref name=reitter08/&gt; the Orthodox Jews accusing the Reform Jews of identifying more closely with German Protestantism and German nationalism than with Judaism.&lt;ref name=lerman/&gt;

According to [[Amos Elon]], during 19th-century German-Jewish assimilation, conflicting pressures on sensitive and privileged or gifted young Jews produced "a reaction later known as 'Jewish self-hatred.' Its roots were not simply professional or political but emotional."&lt;ref name= "Elon"&gt;Amos Elon,"The Pity of It All : a History of Jews in Germany, 1743-1933," Metropolitan Books 2002, pp.231-237.&lt;/ref&gt; Elon uses the term "Jewish self-hatred" synonymously with Jewish antisemitism when he points out, "One of the most prominent Austrian anti-Semites was [[Otto Weininger]] a brilliant young Jew" who "published '[[Sex and Character]]', attacking Jews and women." Elon attributes Jewish antisemitism as a cause in the overall growth of antisemitism when he says,"(Weininger's) book inspired the typical Viennese adage that anti-Semitism did not really get serious until it was taken up by Jews."

According to John P. Jackson Jr., the concept developed in the late nineteenth century in [[German Jewish]] discourse as "a response of [[German Jews]] to popular anti-Semitism that primarily was directed at [[Eastern European Jews]]." For German Jews, the [[Eastern Europe]]an Jew became the "bad Jew".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=John P, Jr|author2=Jackson, John P |title=Social Scientists for Social Justice: Making the Case Against Segregation|publisher=NYU Press|year=2001|pages=121–122|isbn= 978-0-8147-4266-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=i431HiayZ9QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Social+Scientists+for+Social+Justice#PPA121,M1|accessdate=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sander Gilman, the concept of the "self-hating Jew" developed from a merger of the image of the "mad Jew" and the "self-critical Jew",&lt;ref name=reitter08/&gt; and was developed to counter suggestions that an alleged Jewish stereotype of mental illness was due to inbreeding. "Within the logic of the concept, those who accuse others of being self-hating Jews may themselves be self-hating Jews."&lt;ref&gt;Gilman 1986, as described by Finlay (2005:208). Gilman, S. (1986). ''Jewish self-hatred: Anti-Semitism and the hidden language of the Jews.'' Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilman says "the ubiquitousness of self-hatred cannot be denied. And it has shaped the self-awareness of those treated as different perhaps more than they themselves have been aware."&lt;ref name= "Gilman"/&gt;{{Rp|1}}

The specific terms "self-hating Jew" and "Jewish self-hatred" only came into use later, developing from [[Theodor Herzl]]'s polemical use of the term "anti-Semite of Jewish origin", in the context of his project of political Zionism.&lt;ref name=reitter08/&gt; The underlying concept gained common currency in this context, "since Zionism was an important part of the vigorous debates that were occurring amongst Jews at the time about anti-Semitism, assimilation and Jewish identity."&lt;ref name="Finlay"/&gt; Herzl appears to have introduced the phrase "anti-Semite of Jewish origin" in his 1896 book, ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'' (The Jews' State), which launched political Zionism.&lt;ref name=reitter08&gt;Paul Reitter (2008), "Zionism and the Rhetoric of Jewish Self-Hatred", ''The Germanic Review'' 83(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

He was referring to "philanthropic Zionists", assimilated Jews who might wish to remain in their home countries while at the same time encouraging the Jewish proletariat (particularly the poorer Eastern Jews) to emigrate; yet did not support Herzl's political project for a Jewish state.&lt;ref name=reitter08/&gt; Ironically, Herzl was soon complaining that his "polemical term"&lt;ref name=reitter08/&gt; was often being applied to him, for example by [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]].&lt;ref name=reitter08/&gt; "Assimilationists and anti-Zionists accused Zionists of being self-haters, for promoting the idea of the strong Jew using rhetoric close to that of the Anti-Semites; Zionists accused their opponents of being self-haters, for promoting the image of the Jew that would perpetuate his inferior position in the modern world."&lt;ref name=lerman/&gt;

The Austrian-Jewish journalist, [[Anton Kuh]],  argued in a 1921 book ''Juden und Deutsche (Jews and Germans)'' that the concept of "Jewish anti-semitism" was unhelpful, and should be replaced with the term "Jewish self-hatred", but it was not until the 1930 publication of the German-Jewish anti-Nazi philosopher [[Theodor Lessing]]'s book ''Der Jüdische Selbsthass'' (Jewish Self-hatred) that the term gained widespread currency.&lt;ref name=reitter08/&gt; Lessing's book "supposedly charts Lessing’s journey from Jewish self-hater to Zionist."&lt;ref name=lerman/&gt; In it he analyses the writings of Jews such as Otto Weininger and [[Arthur Trebitsch]] who expressed hatred for their own Judaism. Lessing was assassinated by Nazi agents shortly after [[Hitler]] came to power.

===In English===
In English the first major discussion of the topic was in the 1940s by [[Kurt Lewin]], who was Lessing's colleague at the University of Berlin in 1930.&lt;ref name=reitter08/&gt; Lewin emigrated from Germany to the United States in 1933, and though focused on Jews also argued for a similar phenomenon among Polish, Italian and Greek immigrants to the USA.&lt;ref name="Finlay"/&gt; Lewin's was a theoretical account, declaring that the issue "is well known among Jews themselves" and supporting his argument with anecdotes.&lt;ref name="Finlay"/&gt; According to Lewin, a self-hating Jew "will dislike everything specifically Jewish, for he will see in it that which keeps him away from the majority for which he is longing. He will show dislike for those Jews who are outspokenly so, and will frequently indulge in self-hatred."&lt;ref name="Lewin"&gt;Kurt Lewin,''Resolving Social Conflicts and Field Theory in Social Science'', New York: Harper, 1948, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Lewin's lead, the concept gained widespread currency. "The 1940s and 1950s were ‘the age of self-hatred’. In effect, a bitter war broke out over questions of Jewish identity. It was a kind of ‘Jewish Cold War’..."&lt;ref name=lerman/&gt; in which questions of Jewish identity were contentiously debated. The use of the concept in debates over Jewish identity - for example over resistance to the integration of African Americans into Jewish neighbourhoods - died down by the end of the 1970s, having been "steadily emptied of most of its earlier psychological, social, and theoretical content and became largely a slogan."&lt;ref name=glenn/&gt;

The term was used in a derogatory way during the 1940s by "'militant' Zionists",&lt;ref name=glenn/&gt; but the 1963 publication of [[Hannah Arendt]]'s ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]'' opened a new chapter. Her criticism of the trial as a "[[show trial]]" provoked heated public debate, including accusations of self-hatred, and over-shadowed her earlier work criticising German Jewish ''[[parvenu]]'' assimilationism.&lt;ref name=glenn/&gt; In the following years, after the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] and 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], "willingness to give moral and financial 'support' to Israel constituted what one historian called ‘the existential definition of American Jewishness’."&lt;ref name=glenn/&gt; "This meant that the opposite was also true: criticism of Israel came to constitute the existential definition of ‘Jewish self-hatred’."&lt;ref name=lerman/&gt; This is dismissed by
Rosenfeld saying it "masquerades as victimization" and "can hardly be expected to be taken seriously" since criticism of Israel "proceeds across all the media in this country and within Israel itself."&lt;ref name=Rosenfeld/&gt;

Even ''[[Commentary Magazine|Commentary]]'', the Jewish journal which had once been "considered the venue of self-hating Jews with questionable commitments to the Zionist project",&lt;ref name=glenn/&gt; came under the editorship of [[Norman Podhoretz]] to staunchly support Israel.&lt;ref name=glenn/&gt; In his 2006 essay "[[Progressive Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism]]", [[Alvin H. Rosenfeld]] takes "a hard look at Jewish authors" whose statements go well beyond "legitimate criticism of Israel," and considers rhetoric that calls into question Israel's "right to continued existence" to be antisemitic. The use of the concept of self-hatred in Jewish debates about Israel has grown more frequent and more intense in the US and the UK, with the issue particularly widely debated in 2007, leading to the creation of the British [[Independent Jewish Voices]].&lt;ref name=lerman/&gt; [[The Forward]] reported that the group was formed by "about 130 generally leftist Jews."&lt;ref name= "Rebecca Spence"&gt;Rebecca Spence, "[http://forward.com/articles/10046/left-wing-critics-of-israel-launch-blog-to-combat/ Left-wing Critics of Israel Launch Blog to Combat Alleged Intimidation]", ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'', Feb.9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Rosenfeld essay, which did not use the term Jewish self-hatred, that led to the 2007 debate. Critics claimed the charge of antisemitism implied Jewish self-hatred to those criticizing Israel. Rosenfeld responded that such claims were "disingenuous" and for some a "dialectical scam validating themselves as intellectual martyrs."&lt;ref name=Rosenfeld/&gt; The New York Times reported that the essay spotlighted the issue of when "legitimate criticism of Israel ends and antisemitic statements begin."&lt;ref name= "Patricia Cohen"&gt;Patricia Cohen, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/arts/31jews.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Essay Linking Liberal Jews and Anti-Semitism Sparks a Furor]". New York Times, Jan. 31, 2007,&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social and psychological explanations ==
The issue has periodically been covered in the academic [[social psychology]]  literature on [[social identity]].  Such studies "frequently cite Lewin as evidence that people may attempt to distance themselves from membership in devalued groups because they accept, to some degree, the negative evaluations of their group held by the majority and because these social identities are an obstacle to the pursuit of [[social status]]."&lt;ref name="Finlay"/&gt; Modern social psychology literature uses terms such as "self-stigmatization", "[[internalized oppression]]", and "[[false consciousness]]" to describe this type of phenomenon. Phyllis Chesler, the professor of psychology and women's studies, in referring to female Jewish self-hatred, points to progressive Jewish women who "seem obsessed with
the Palestinian point of view." She believes their rage against oppression, frustration and patriarchy "is being unconsciously transferred onto Israel."&lt;ref name= "Chesler"&gt;Phyllis Chesler, "The New Anti-Semitism," Josse-Bass Wiley Imprint 2005, pp. 187-188.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenneth Levin]], a Harvard psychiatrist, says that Jewish self-hatred has two causes: [[Stockholm syndrome]], where "population segments under chronic siege commonly embrace the indictments of their besiegers however bigoted and outrageous", as well as "the [[psychodynamics]] of abused children, who almost invariably blame themselves for their predicament, ascribe it to their being "bad," and nurture fantasies that by becoming "good" they can mollify their abusers and end their torment."&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Levin [http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-046-levin.htm "The Psychology of Populations under Chronic Siege"], ''Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism'', No. 46 2 July 2006, [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]. Accessed Feb 2010&lt;/ref&gt; According to Howard W. Polsky, the social scientist, "feelings about Jewish marginality are often a step away from self-hatred." He then
says, "Jewish self-hatred denotes that a person has adopted gentiles' definition of Jew as bad in one way or another and that being Jewish will hinder their success or identity."&lt;ref name= "Polsky"&gt;Howard W. Polsky, "How I am a Jew, Adventures into my Jewish-American Identity," University Press of America 2002, pp.16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
It is argued by some academics that the concept of Jewish self-hatred is based on an essentialisation of [[Jewish identity]]. Accounts of Jewish self-hatred often suggest that criticizing other Jews, and integrating with Gentile society, reveals hatred of one’s own Jewish origins.&lt;ref name="Finlay"/&gt; Yet both in the early twentieth century, where the concept developed, and today, there are groups of Jews who had "important differences in identity based on class, culture, religious outlook, and education", and hostility between these groups can only be considered self-hate "if one assumes that a superordinate Jewish identity should take precedence over other groupings of Jews."&lt;ref name="Finlay"/&gt;

Yet such hostility between groups has at times drawn on some of the rhetoric of antisemitism: "criticism of subgroups of Jews which drew on anti-Semitic rhetoric were common in 19th and 20th century arguments over Jewish identity".&lt;ref name="Finlay"/&gt; In practice, according to one academic, whilst there have been Jewish writers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries who consistently employed virulent antisemitic rhetoric without seeming to value any aspects of being a Jew, too often "those who accuse others of being self-haters search for examples of when they have criticized Jews or Judaism but ignore examples of when those they criticize have shown they value being a Jew."&lt;ref name="Finlay"/&gt; He argues that Jewish antisemitism does not necessarily amount to self-hatred, implying that "antisemitic Jew" may be a more accurate term to use. Other authors have also shown a preference for using "antisemitism" rather than "self-hatred."&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wasserstein"/&gt;

The term is in use in Jewish publications such as ''[[The Jewish Week]]'' (New York) and ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' (Jerusalem) in a number of contexts, often synonymously with antisemitic Jew. It is used "to criticize a performer or artist who portrays Jews negatively; as a shorthand description of supposed psychological conflict in fictional characters; in articles about the erosion of tradition (e.g. marrying out and circumcision); and to discount Jews who criticize Israeli policies or particular Jewish practices."&lt;ref name="Finlay"/&gt; However the widest usage of the term is currently in relation to debates over Israel. "In these debates the accusation is used by right-wing Zionists to assert that Zionism and/or support for Israel is a core element of Jewish identity. Jewish criticism of Israeli policy is therefore considered a turning away from Jewish identity itself."&lt;ref name="Finlay"/&gt;

Thus some of those who have been accused of being a "self-hating Jew" have characterized the term as a replacement for "a charge of anti-Semitism [that] will not stick,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gisborneherald.co.nz/html/Articles/ArticlesPrint.aspx?id=8879 |title=No choice but to speak out - Israeli musician ‘a proud self-hating Jew’ |last=Gibson |first=Martin |date=2009-01-23 |work=The Gisborne Herald |accessdate=2009-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203190825/http://gisborneherald.co.nz/html/Articles/ArticlesPrint.aspx?id=8879 |archivedate=February 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or as "pathologizing" them.&lt;ref name="Finlay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marqusee"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/04/israelandthepalestinians.bookextracts|title=The first time I was called a self-hating Jew|last=Marqusee|first=Mike|date=4 Mar 2008|work=extract from ''If I Am Not for Myself: Journey of an Anti-Zionist Jew''|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some who use the term have equated it with "anti-Semitism",&lt;ref&gt;''Huffington Post'', [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-forer/self-hating-jew-a-strategy-to-hide-from-self-reflection_b_1735006.html The Self-Hating Jew: A Strategy to Hide From Self-Reflection.]  August 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Quarterly'': [http://www.jewishquarterly.org/issuearchive/article2366.html?articleid=432 Jewish Self-Hatred : Myth or Reality ?]  Summer 2008, Number 210.&lt;/ref&gt; on the part of those thus addressed, or with "so called ‘enlightened’ Jews who refuse to associate themselves with people who practice a ‘backward’ religion."&lt;ref name="brackman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3298371,00.html|title=Confronting the self hating Jew|last=Brackman|first=Rabbi Levi|date= September 1, 2006 |work=Israel Jewish Scene|publisher=ynetnews|accessdate=2009-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; One novelist, [[Philip Roth]], who — because of the nature of the Jewish characters in his novels, such as the 1969 ''[[Portnoy's Complaint]]''&lt;ref name=glenn&gt;Glenn, Susan A.

==Controversy and criticism of the term==
The legitimacy of the term (in modern usage) remains [[Controversy|controversial]]. According to the transdenominational Jewish platform ''My Jewish Learning'': "Some scholars have claimed that by labeling another Jew self-hating, the accuser is claiming his or her own Judaism as [[normative]]–and implying that the Judaism of the accused is flawed or incorrect, based on a metric of the accuser’s own stances, religious beliefs, or political opinions. By arguing with the label, then, the accused is rejecting what has been defined as normative Judaism. The term “self-hating” thus places the person or object labeled outside the boundaries of the discourse–and outside the boundaries of the community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/self-hating-jews/3/ Self-Hating Jews: The Legacy of Self-Hatred], ''MyJewishLearning''&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Haaretz]]'' writes that the term is almost exclusively used today by the [[Jewish right]] against the [[Jewish left]], and that within left-wing and liberal circles, is "usually considered a joke".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.664162 Self-hating Jews Are Not Necessarily Leftists], ''[[Haaretz]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Forer, writing for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', rejects the legitimacy of the term as it is commonly used, calling them so divisive that they make tolerance and cooperation impossible, eradicating the possibility for genuine understanding. Forer writes: "The notion that any Jew who is dedicated to justice for all people harbors self-hatred defies common sense. Given the self-esteem it takes to stand for justice amidst fierce denunciation, a more accurate assessment is that these are self-loving Jews."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-forer/self-hating-jew-a-strategy-to-hide-from-self-reflection_b_1735006.html The Self-Hating Jew: A Strategy to Hide From Self-Reflection], ''[[The Huffington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Stewart]], former host of ''[[The Daily Show]]'', was repeatedly called a "self-hating Jew" by people whom he described as "[[Fascism|fascistic]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4591891,00.html Jon Stewart lashes out at critics who call him a self-hating Jew], ''[[Ynet]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the term to be like equating someone with the Jews who turned their backs on each other during the [[Holocaust]], he said, "I have people that I lost in the Holocaust and I just … go fuck yourself. How dare you?" Stewart commented that the way his critics used the term—to define [[Who is a Jew?|who is a Jew and who is not]]—was formerly always done by people who weren’t Jewish. He saw this as "more than [[nationalism]]". Stewart also criticized right-wing Jews for implying that they are the only ones who can decide what it means to be Jewish: "And you can’t observe ([[Judaism]]) in the way you want to observe. And I never thought that that would be coming from brethren. ... How dare they? That they only know the word of [[God in Judaism|God]] and are the ones who are able to disseminate it. It's not right."&lt;ref&gt;[http://o.canada.com/entertainment/celebrity/jon-stewart-on-criticism-of-his-coverage-of-israel Jon Stewart on criticism of his coverage of Israel], ''canada.com''&lt;/ref&gt; To ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', he said, "Look, there's a lot of reasons why I hate myself — being Jewish isn't one of them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/jon-stewart-rosewater-daily-show-728386 Jon Stewart on Directorial Debut 'Rosewater,' His 'Daily Show' Future and Those Israel-Gaza Comments], ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Noam Chomsky]] said that Zionists divided critics of Israeli policy into two groups: antisemitic non-Jews and neurotic self-hating Jews, stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Actually, the ''locus classicus'', the best formulation of this, was by an ambassador to the United Nations, [[Abba Eban]],  Israel's ambassador to the United Nations.... He advised the American Jewish community that they had two tasks to perform. One task was to show that criticism of the policy, what he called anti-Zionism—that means actually criticisms of the policy of the state of Israel—were anti-Semitism. That's the first task. Second task, if the criticism was made by Jews, their task was to show that it's neurotic self-hatred, needs psychiatric treatment. Then he gave two examples of the latter category. One was [[I. F. Stone]]. The other was me. So, we have to be treated for our psychiatric disorders, and non-Jews have to be condemned for anti-Semitism, if they're critical of the state of Israel. That's understandable why Israeli propaganda would take this position. I don’t particularly blame Abba Eban for doing what ambassadors are sometimes supposed to do. But we ought to understand that there is no sensible charge. No sensible charge. There's nothing to respond to. It's not a form of anti-Semitism. It's simply criticism of the criminal actions of a state, period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |authorlink=Noam Chomsky |interviewer=[[Amy Goodman]] |title=Noam Chomsky at United Nations: It Would Be Nice if the United States Lived Up to International Law |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2014/11/27/noam_chomsky_at_united_nations_it |date=27 November 2014 |work=[[Democracy Now!]] |accessdate=1 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Bernie Sanders]], one of the Democratic candidates running for US Presidential elections in 2016, has repeatedly been accused of being a "self-hating Jew".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breakingisraelnews.com/66876/jewish-comedy-legend-jackie-mason-bernie-sanders-self-hating-anti-semite/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://qz.com/666134/bernie-sanders-is-presidential-candidates-talk-about-israel/]&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, Larry Sanders, told the ''[[Times of Israel]]'' that this was because his brother disagreed with [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s foreign policy. "Bernard is not a self-hating Jew. There was never a moment in our life when we had any reason to be self-hating. The fact that he does not agree with Netanyahu on politics does not make him a self-hating Jew."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/sanders-brother-clashing-with-netanyahu-isnt-sign-of-self-hating-jew/ Sanders’ brother: Clashing with Netanyahu isn’t sign of self-hating Jew], ''[[Times of Israel]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, after a reporter asked him if he was "intentionally keeping his Judaism in the background", Sanders stated that he is "very proud to be Jewish, and being Jewish is so much of what I am. Look, my father's family was wiped out by Hitler in the Holocaust. I know about what crazy and radical, and extremist politics mean."&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/07/politics/democratic-debate-jewish-bernie-sanders-cnn-flint-michigan/ Bernie Sanders: 'My father's family was wiped out by Hitler in the Holocaust'], ''[[CNN]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Max Berger wrote in ''[[Haaretz]]'', "While some in the Jewish American establishment strive to marginalize Bernie and his movement by suggesting we’re self-hating Jews who don’t care about Israel, it just goes to show how badly out of touch they are with the future of our community, and the values of our tradition."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.714596 Bernie Sanders vs. the Out-of-touch American Jewish Establishment], ''[[Haaretz]]''&lt;/ref&gt; A related dispute revolved around his Jewish advisor, Simone Zimmerman, who was similarly accused of being a self-hating Jew.

Unlike the majority of [[Fiji]]'s [[Indians in Fiji|Indian population]], who are descendants of Indian [[indenture]]d labourers brought to Fiji between 1879 and 1916, most of the [[Sikh]]s came to Fiji as free [[immigrant]]s. Most Sikhs established themselves as farmers. Sikhs also came to Fiji as policemen, teachers and preachers. In recent years large numbers of Sikhs have emigrated from Fiji, especially to the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]]. Sikhs in Fiji are generally referred to as [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]]s.

== Arrival in Fiji ==

=== Under indenture system ===
Recruitment of indentured labour for Fiji did not take place in Punjab (the home of the Sikh, Muslim and Hindu people) but some people who stated their home province as being Punjab were recruited from other parts of India and boarded ships to Fiji from Calcutta. Between 1879 and 1900, out of the 21,368 emigrants from Calcutta, only 369 were from Punjab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Gillion| first = Kenneth| title = Fiji's Indian Migrants: A history to the end of indenture in 1920| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 1973| location = Melbourne| isbn = 0-19-550452-6| pages = 208}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although no religious breakdown of these Punjabi migrants is available, because of the enterprising nature of the Sikh people a large proportion of these would have been Sikhs.

=== As free migrants ===
The first Sikh free migrants came to Fiji as part of the group of seventy Punjabis who were lured into coming to [[New Caledonia]], in 1904, on the understanding that high wages were paid there. After finding working conditions unacceptable in the [[France|French]] colony, the seventy came to Fiji where some found temporary employment but most soon left for India dissatisfied at the low wages paid in Fiji. From 1905, when the Union Steam Ship Company of [[New Zealand]] began a regular service from [[Calcutta]] to Fiji, there was a regular flow of Sikhs and people from Punjab also known as the Saint Ravidass community to Fiji. Some came to Fiji to make it easier for them to enter North America, [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and even [[Argentina]].

The early Sikh and the Ravidass community migrants were mainly from the [[Jullundur]] and [[Hoshiarpur District|Hoshiapur]] districts, although some also came from [[Ludhiana]], [[Amritsar]], [[Ferozepore]], [[Lahore]], [[Ambala]] and [[Rohtak]] districts of [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]]. They were all young and mostly younger sons. They came with few women and those who stayed in Fiji married Hindu women and became prosperous farmers and some of them went back to Punjab to get married within their caste and culture and brought their wives to Fiji and started their family. Majority of the people maintained close ties with their families in the Punjab and remitted money back to their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Gillion| first = Kenneth| title = Fiji's Indian Migrants: A history to the end of indenture in 1920| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 1973| location = Melbourne| isbn = 0-19-550452-6| pages = 131–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As policemen ===
From 1900 Sikh policemen were brought to Fiji from [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shanghai]]. [[C. F. Andrews]] and W. W. Pearson, in their report on Indian indentured labour in Fiji, in February 1916, expressed high regard for the Indian Police Force in [[Suva]] made up of Sikhs. They noted that unlike in India these policemen did not take bribes. They wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We found an extremely well-conducted Indian Police Force in Suva. These Indians, who were Sikhs, were paid a good monthly wage, and expressed themselves, on the whole, contented with their position. They had come out under an agreement, but there was nothing about it that was servile. Their passage was quite different from that of the ordinary coolies... They were treated well by their senior officers, who spoke highly of their men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Andrews |first=C. F. |authorlink= |author2=W. W. Pearson  |title= Indian indentured labour in Fiji|year= 1918|publisher= |location= Perth, Australia|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Walter Gill, who served as an overseer for the [[Colonial Sugar Refining Company (Fiji)|Colonial Sugar Refining Company]] in [[Lautoka]] during the final years of indenture, has also written about significant numbers of Sikhs employed in the [[Western Division, Fiji|Western Division of Fiji]] to police the Indian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gill|first=Walter |authorlink= |title= Turn North-East at the Tombstone|year= 1970|publisher=Rigby Limited |location= Melbourne, Australia|isbn=0-85179-047-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sikh Gurdwaras in Fiji ==
Sikh [[Gurdwara]]s have been established in areas of Fiji where there is a concentration Sikhs. These temples do not only serve as places of worship but as a place where the food and shelter were provided for the needy. The first Sikh temple in Fiji was built in Samabula (near [[Suva]]) in 1922 to provide for the needs of new Sikh migrants. Once Tamavua and [[Nasinu]] areas (near Suva) had a large concentration of Sikhs and in 1943 First Shree Guru Ravidass Gurudwara was established in Nasinu 6 miles.The founding fathers of this Guru Ravidass Gurudwara (a.k.a.)  AD-Punjab Association came from Punjab India in early 1900s. Registered trustee's are Mr. Lachhu Ram a.k.a. Lachhu Sheemar (f/n) Khema Ram, Mr. Rakha Ram (f/n)Phila Ram, Mr. Bakshi Ram (f/n) Melu Ram, Mr. Khushi Ram (f/n) Atchu Ram, Mr. Mehnga Ram (f/n) Nathu Ram. Most Sikhs from the settlements around Suva have emigrated to the [[United States]] and Canada and some have moved to the [[Western Division, Fiji|Western Division]] to undertake cane farming. There is a concentration of Sikh cane farmers in Mataniqara and Tagitagi which lie between [[Ba (town)|Ba]] and [[Tavua, Fiji|Tavua]] and to cater for their needs, a temple was built in Tagitagi. There is another temple in [[Lautoka|Lautoka City]], built to cater for the needs of the Sikhs in the Sabeto Valley, but many of these have either left for overseas or moved into the naighbouring settlement of Vutualevu. There is only one temple outside the main island of [[Viti Levu]] and it is located in the town of [[Labasa]] in the second largest island of [[Vanua Levu]]. All the temples in Fiji, except the one in Nasinu, are controlled by temple committees and funded by donations from the local Sikh community. The Ravidass Gurudwara also known as Nasinu Gurudwara is funded by the followers of the Ravidass community in Fiji.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Singh|first=Gajraj |authorlink= |title= The Sikhs of Fiji|year=1972 |publisher= South Pacific Social Sciences Association|location= Suva, Fiji|isbn= |pages = 42–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sikh schools in Fiji ==
The first schools built by Sikhs in Fiji was the Khalsa High School in [[Ba District, Fiji]] in 1958 to provide instruction in the [[Gurmukhi|Gurmukhi script]] of [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] to Sikh pupils. It is at present a multi-racial and co-educational institution open to students of all communities. In 1972, out of a total roll of 491 students, only 124 were Sikhs. The Guru Nanak Khalsa Parimary School was also built at the same site in Ba. A small school, the Naduri Bay Khalsa Primary School, was built near [[Sigatoka]] to provide for the needs of the small Sikh community in the area. The Guru Nanak Khalsa Primary School opened in [[Labasa]] in 1970 with a roll of 47 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Singh|first=Gajraj |authorlink= |title= The Sikhs of Fiji|year=1972 |publisher= South Pacific Social Sciences Association|location= Suva, Fiji|isbn= |pages = 52–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Tibet}}

The exact nature of '''relations between [[Tibet]] and the [[Ming dynasty]]''' of [[China]] (1368–1644) is unclear. Analysis of the relationship is further complicated by modern political conflicts and the application of [[Westphalian sovereignty]] to a time when the concept did not exist. Some [[Mainland Chinese]] scholars such as Wang Jiawei and [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] scholars such as Nyima Gyaincain, assert that the Ming dynasty had unquestioned [[sovereignty]] over Tibet, pointing to the Ming court's issuing of various titles to Tibetan leaders, Tibetans' full acceptance of these titles, and a renewal process for successors of these titles that involved traveling to the Ming capital. Scholars within China also argue that Tibet has been an integral part of China since the 13th century and that it was thus a part of the Ming Empire. But most scholars outside China, such as Turrell V. Wylie, Melvin C. Goldstein, and Helmut Hoffman, say that the relationship was one of [[suzerainty]], that Ming titles were only nominal, that Tibet remained an independent region outside Ming control, and that it [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|simply paid tribute]] until the [[Jiajing Emperor]] (1521–1566), who ceased relations with Tibet.

Some scholars note that Tibetan leaders during the Ming frequently engaged in [[civil war]] and conducted their own foreign diplomacy with neighboring states such as [[Nepal]]. Some scholars underscore the commercial aspect of the Ming-Tibetan relationship, noting the Ming dynasty's shortage of [[horses in warfare|horses for warfare]] and thus the importance of the horse trade with Tibet. Others argue that the significant [[Chinese Buddhism|religious nature]] of the relationship of the Ming court with Tibetan [[lama]]s is underrepresented in modern scholarship. In hopes of reviving the unique relationship of the earlier [[Mongols|Mongol]] leader [[Kublai Khan]] (r.&amp;nbsp;1260–1294) and his spiritual superior [[Drogön Chögyal Phagpa]] (1235–1280) of the [[Sakya]] school of Tibetan Buddhism, the [[Yongle Emperor]] (r.&amp;nbsp;1402–1424) made a concerted effort to build a secular and religious alliance with [[Deshin Shekpa, 5th Karmapa Lama|Deshin Shekpa]] (1384–1415), the [[Karmapa]] of the [[Karma Kagyu]] school. However, the Yongle Emperor's attempts were unsuccessful.

The Ming initiated sporadic armed intervention in Tibet during the 14th century, but did not garrison permanent troops there. At times the Tibetans also used armed resistance against Ming forays. The [[Wanli Emperor]] (r.&amp;nbsp;1572–1620) made attempts to reestablish Sino-Tibetan relations after the [[History of Tibet#Beginnings of the Dalai Lama lineage|Mongol-Tibetan alliance]] initiated in 1578, which affected the foreign policy of the subsequent [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) of China in their support for the [[Dalai Lama]] of the [[Gelug]] school. By the late 16th century, the Mongols were successful armed protectors of the Gelug Dalai Lama, after increasing their presence in the [[Amdo]] region. This culminated in [[Güshi Khan]]'s (1582–1655) conquest of Tibet from 1637–1642 and the establishment of the [[Ganden Phodrang]] regime by the [[5th Dalai Lama]] with his help.

=== Mongol Empire ===

[[File:Chogyal.JPG|thumb|left|[[Drogön Chögyal Phagpa]], one of the five founders of the [[Sakya]] school of Tibetan Buddhism, was appointed as the [[Imperial Preceptor]] and granted power over Tibet by the Mongol ruler [[Kublai Khan]] (r.&amp;nbsp;1260–1294).]]

Tibet was once a strong power contemporaneous with [[Tang dynasty|Tang China]] (618–907). Until the [[Tibetan Empire]]'s collapse in the 9th century, it was the Tang's major rival in dominating [[Inner Asia]].&lt;ref name="goldstein 1"&gt;Melvyn C. Goldstein, ''Snow Lion and the Dragon: China, Tibet and the Dalai Lama'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997), 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twitchett 106 179"&gt;Denis Twitchett, "Tibet in Tang's Grand Strategy", in ''Warfare in Chinese History'' (Leiden: Koninklijke Brill, 2000), 106–179.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of emperors of Tibet|Yarlung rulers]] of Tibet also signed various peace treaties with the Tang, [[Tang dynasty#Turk and Western Regions|culminating in a treaty in 821]] that fixed the borders between Tibet and China.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. van Walt van Praag, ''The Status of Tibet: History, Rights, and Prospects in International Law'' (Boulder: Westview Press, 1987), 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] of China (907–960), while the fractured political realm of China saw no threat in a Tibet which was in just as much political disarray, there was little in the way of Sino-Tibetan relations.&lt;ref name="kolmas 12 14"&gt;Josef Kolmas, ''Tibet and Imperial China: A Survey of Sino-Tibetan Relations Up to the End of the Manchu Dynasty in 1912: Occasional Paper 7'' (Canberra: The Australian National University, Centre of Oriental Studies, 1967), 12–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="van praag 4"&gt;Van Praag, ''The Status of Tibet'', 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Few documents involving Sino-Tibetan contacts survive from the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279).&lt;ref name="van praag 4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kolmas 14 17" /&gt; The Song were far more concerned with [[History of the Song dynasty|countering northern enemy states]] of the [[Khitan people|Khitan]]-ruled [[Liao dynasty]] (907–1125) and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-ruled [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]].&lt;ref name="kolmas 14 17"&gt;Kolmas, ''Tibet and Imperial China'', 14–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1207, the [[Mongols|Mongol]] ruler [[Genghis Khan]] (r.&amp;nbsp;1206–1227) conquered and subjugated the ethnic [[Tangut people|Tangut]] state of the [[Western Xia]] (1038–1227).&lt;ref name="van praag 5"&gt;Van Praag, ''The Status of Tibet'', 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he established diplomatic relations with Tibet by sending envoys there.&lt;ref name="chan 261"&gt;Hok-Lam Chan, "The Chien-wen, Yung-lo, Hung-shi, and Hsuan-te reigns", in ''The Cambridge History of China: Volume 7, The Ming Dynasty, 1368–1644, Part 1'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), 261.&lt;/ref&gt; The conquest of the Western Xia alarmed Tibetan rulers, who decided to pay tribute to the Mongols.&lt;ref name="van praag 5" /&gt; However, when they ceased to pay tribute after Genghis Khan's death, his successor [[Ögedei Khan]] (r.&amp;nbsp;1229–1241) launched an invasion into Tibet.&lt;ref name="goldstein 2 3"&gt;Goldstein, ''The Snow Lion and the Dragon'', 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mongol prince [[Godan Khan|Godan]], a grandson of Genghis Khan, raided as far as [[Lhasa]].&lt;ref name="van praag 5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="goldstein 3"&gt;Goldstein, ''The Snow Lion and the Dragon'', 3.&lt;/ref&gt; During his attack in 1240, Prince Godan summoned [[Sakya Pandita]] (1182–1251), leader of the [[Sakya]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], to his court in what is now [[Gansu]] in [[Western China]].&lt;ref name="van praag 5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="goldstein 3" /&gt; With Sakya Pandita's submission to Godan in 1247, Tibet was officially incorporated into the [[Mongol Empire]] during the regency of [[Töregene Khatun]] (1241–1246).&lt;ref name="goldstein 3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rossabi 18"&gt;Morris Rossabi, ''Khubilai Khan: His Life and Times'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael C. van Walt van Praag writes that Godan granted Sakya Pandita temporal authority over a still politically fragmented Tibet, stating that "this investiture had little real impact" but it was significant in that it established the unique "Priest-Patron" relationship between the Mongols and the Sakya lamas.&lt;ref name="van praag 5" /&gt;

Starting in 1236, the Mongol prince [[Kublai Khan|Kublai]], who later ruled as [[Khagan]] from 1260–1294, was granted a large appanage in [[Northern and southern China|North China]] by his superior, Ögedei Khan.&lt;ref name="rossabi 14 41"&gt;Rossabi, ''Khubilai Khan'', 14–41.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karma Pakshi, 2nd Karmapa Lama]] (1203–1283)—the head [[lama]] of the [[Karma Kagyu]] lineage of Tibetan Buddhism—rejected Kublai's invitation, so instead Kublai invited [[Drogön Chögyal Phagpa]] (1235–1280), successor and nephew of Sakya Pandita, who came to his court in 1253.&lt;ref name="rossabi 40 41"&gt;Rossabi, ''Khubilai Khan'', 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="patterson 88"&gt;George N. Patterson, "China and Tibet: Background to the Revolt", ''The China Quarterly'', no. 1 (January–March 1960): 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="van praag 6"&gt;Van Praag, ''The Status of Tibet'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Kublai instituted a unique relationship with the Phagpa lama, which recognized Kublai as a superior sovereign in political affairs and the Phagpa lama as the senior instructor to Kublai in religious affairs.&lt;ref name="rossabi 40 41" /&gt;&lt;ref name="van praag 6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patterson 88 89"&gt;Patterson, "China and Tibet", 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Kublai also made Drogön Chögyal Phagpa the director of the government agency known as the [[Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs]] and the ruling priest-king of Tibet, which comprised thirteen different states ruled by myriarchies.&lt;ref name="van praag 6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patterson 88 89" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wylie the first mongol conquest"&gt;Turrell V. Wylie, "The First Mongol Conquest of Tibet Reinterpreted", ''Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies'' 37, no. 1 (June 1997): 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yuan dynasty and Tibet.jpg|thumb|Tibet within the Yuan dynasty under the top-level department known as the [[Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs]] (Xuanzheng Yuan).]]
Kublai Khan did not [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty|conquer the Song dynasty]] in South China until 1279, so Tibet was a component of the early Mongol Empire before it was combined into one of its descendant empires with the whole of China under the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368).&lt;ref name="van praag 6" /&gt; Van Praag writes that this conquest "marked the end of independent China," which was then incorporated into the Yuan dynasty that ruled China, Tibet, [[Mongolia]], [[Korea]], parts of [[Siberia]] and [[Upper Burma]].&lt;ref name="van praag 6 7"&gt;Van Praag, ''The Status of Tibet'', 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris Rossabi, a professor of Asian history at [[Queens College, City University of New York]], writes that "Khubilai wished to be perceived both as the legitimate Khan of Khans of the Mongols and as the [[Emperor of China]]. Though he had, by the early 1260s, become closely identified with China, he still, for a time, claimed universal rule", and yet "despite his successes in China and Korea, Khubilai was unable to have himself accepted as the Great Khan".&lt;ref name="rossabi 115"&gt;Rossabi, ''Khubilai Khan'', 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, with such limited acceptance of his position as Great Khan, Kublai Khan increasingly became identified with China and sought support as Emperor of China.&lt;ref name="denis 454"&gt;Denis Twitchett, Herbert Franke, John K. Fairbank, in ''The Cambridge History of China: Volume 6, Alien Regimes and Border States'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 454.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overthrow of the Sakya and Yuan ===
In 1358, the Sakya viceregal regime installed by the Mongols in Tibet was overthrown in a rebellion by the Phagmodru myriarch [[Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen]] (1302–1364).&lt;ref name="van praag 6 7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chan 262"&gt;Chan, "The Chien-wen, Yung-lo, Hung-shi, and Hsuan-te reigns", 262.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goldstein 4"&gt;Goldstein, ''The Snow Lion and the Dragon'', 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mongol Yuan court was forced to accept him as the new viceroy, and Changchub Gyaltsen and his successors, the [[Phagmodrupa Dynasty]], gained ''de facto'' rule over Tibet.&lt;ref name="van praag 6 7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chan 262" /&gt;&lt;ref name="goldstein 4" /&gt;

In 1368, a [[Han Chinese]] revolt known as the [[Red Turban Rebellion]] toppled the Mongol Yuan dynasty in China. Zhu Yuanzhang then established the Ming dynasty, ruling as the [[Hongwu Emperor]] (r.&amp;nbsp;1368–1398).&lt;ref name="ebrey 190 191"&gt;Patricia B. Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear how much the early Ming court understood the [[civil war]] going on in Tibet between rival religious sects, but the first emperor was anxious to avoid the same trouble that Tibet had caused for the Tang dynasty.&lt;ref name="chan 262" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rossabi 242 243"&gt;Morris Rossabi, "The Ming and Inner Asia," in ''The Cambridge History of China: Volume 8, The Ming Dynasty, 1368–1644, Part 2'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), 242–243.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of recognizing the Phagmodru ruler, the Hongwu Emperor sided with the Karmapa of the nearer [[Kham]] region and southeastern Tibet, sending envoys out in the winter of 1372–1373 to ask the Yuan officeholders to renew their titles for the new Ming court.&lt;ref name="chan 262" /&gt;

As evident in his imperial edicts, the Hongwu Emperor was well aware of the Buddhist link between Tibet and China and wanted to foster it.&lt;ref name="sperling 475" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rossabi 242"&gt;Rossabi, "The Ming and Inner Asia," 242.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rolpe Dorje, 4th Karmapa Lama]] (1340–1383) rejected the Hongwu Emperor's invitation, although he did send some disciples as envoys to the court in [[Nanjing]].&lt;ref name="chan 262" /&gt; The Hongwu Emperor also entrusted his guru Zongluo, one of many Buddhist monks at court, to head a religious mission into Tibet in 1378–1382 in order to obtain [[Buddhist texts]].&lt;ref name="sperling 475" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rossabi 242" /&gt;

However, the early Ming government enacted a law, later rescinded, which forbade Han Chinese to learn the tenets of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="tuttle 27" /&gt; There is little detailed evidence of Chinese—especially lay Chinese—studying Tibetan Buddhism until the [[History of the Republic of China|Republican era]] (1912–1949).&lt;ref name="tuttle 27"&gt;Gray Tuttle, ''Tibetan Buddhists in the Making of Modern China'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 2005), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these missions on behalf of the Hongwu Emperor, Morris Rossabi writes that the [[Yongle Emperor]] (r. 1402–1424) "was the first Ming ruler actively to seek an extension of relations with Tibet."&lt;ref name="rossabi 243" /&gt;

According to the official ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]'', the ''[[History of Ming]]'' compiled in 1739 by the subsequent [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912), the Ming dynasty established the "Ngari Military-Civilian Marshal Office" in western Tibet and installed the "Ü-Tsang Regional Military [[Commandery (China)|Commission]]" to administrate [[Ü-Tsang]] and "Amdo-Kham Regional Military Commission" (Dokham) to administer [[Amdo]] and [[Kham]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;''[[History of Ming]]''-Geography I 《明史•地理一》: 東起朝鮮，西據吐番，南包安南，北距大磧。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mingshi]]''-Geography III 《明史•地理三》: 七年七月置西安行都衛於此，領河州、朵甘、烏斯藏、三衛。&lt;/ref&gt; The Mingshi states that administrative offices were set up under these high commanderies, including one Itinerant Commandery, three Pacification Commissioner's Offices, six Expedition Commissioner's Offices, four Wanhu offices (myriarchies, in command of 10,000 households each) and seventeen Qianhu offices ([[chiliarch]]ies, each in command of 1,000 households).&lt;ref name="Mingshi"&gt;''[[Mingshi]]''-Military II 《明史•兵二》&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ming court appointed three Princes of Dharma (法王) and five Princes (王), and granted many other titles, such as Grand State Tutors (大國師) and State Tutors (國師), to the important schools of Tibetan Buddhism, including the [[Karma Kagyu]], [[Sakya]], and [[Gelug]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mingshi]]''-Western territory III 《明史•列傳第二百十七西域三》&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wang Jiawei and Nyima Gyaincain, leading officials of these organs were all appointed by the central government and were subject to the rule of law.&lt;ref name="wang nyima 38" /&gt; Yet Van Praag describes the distinct and long-lasting Tibetan law code established by the Phagmodru ruler Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen as one of many reforms to revive old Imperial Tibetan traditions.&lt;ref name="van praag 7" /&gt;

The late Turrell V. Wylie, a former professor of the [[University of Washington]], and Li Tieh-tseng argue that the reliability of the heavily censored ''History of Ming'' as a credible source on Sino-Tibetan relations is questionable, in the light of modern scholarship.&lt;ref name="wylie 470" /&gt; Other historians also assert that these Ming titles were nominal and did not actually confer the authority that the earlier Yuan titles had.&lt;ref name="hoffman 65"&gt;Helmut Hoffman, "Early and Medieval Tibet", in ''The History of Tibet: Volume 1, The Early Period to c. AD 850, the Yarlung Dynasty'' (New York: Routledge, 2003), 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goldstein 4 5" /&gt; Van Praag writes that the "numerous economically motivated Tibetan missions to the Ming Court are referred to as 'tributary missions' in the ''Ming Shih''."&lt;ref name="van praag 8"&gt;Van Praag, ''The Status of Tibet'', 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Van Praag writes that these "tributary missions" were simply prompted by China's need for horses from Tibet, since a viable horse market in Mongol lands was closed as a result of incessant conflict.&lt;ref name="van praag 8" /&gt; Morris Rossabi also writes that "Tibet, which had extensive contacts with China during the Yuan, scarcely had diplomatic relations with the Ming."&lt;ref name="rossabi 241"&gt;Morris Rossabi, "The Ming and Inner Asia," in ''The Cambridge History of China: Volume 8, The Ming Dynasty, 1368–1644, Part 2'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern scholarly debates on Tibet-Ming relations ==

=== Inheritance, reappointments, and titles ===

==== Transition from Yuan to Ming ====
Historians disagree on what the relationship was between the Ming court and Tibet and whether or not Ming China had sovereignty over Tibet. Van Praag writes that Chinese court historians viewed Tibet as an independent foreign tributary and had little interest in Tibet besides a lama-patron relationship.&lt;ref name="Wang nyima 31"&gt;Wang &amp; Nyima, ''The Historical Status of China's Tibet'', 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="van praag 7 8"&gt;Van Praag, ''The Status of Tibet'', 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa]] supports van Praag's position.&lt;ref name="Wang nyima 31" /&gt; However, Wang Jiawei and Nyima Gyaincain state that these assertions by van Praag and Shakabpa are "fallacies".&lt;ref name="Wang nyima 31" /&gt;

Wang and Nyima argue that the Ming emperor sent edicts to Tibet twice in the second year of the Ming dynasty, and demonstrated that he viewed Tibet as a significant region to pacify by urging various Tibetan tribes to submit to the authority of the Ming court.&lt;ref name="Wang nyima 31" /&gt; They note that at the same time, the Mongol Prince Punala, who had inherited his position as ruler of areas of Tibet, went to Nanjing in 1371 to pay tribute and show his allegiance to the Ming court, bringing with him the seal of authority issued by the Yuan court.&lt;ref name="wang nyima 32"&gt;Wang &amp; Nyima, ''The Historical Status of China's Tibet'', 32.&lt;/ref&gt; They also state that since successors of lamas granted the title of "prince" had to travel to the Ming court to renew this title, and since lamas called themselves princes, the Ming court therefore had "full sovereignty over Tibet."&lt;ref name="wang nyima 37"&gt;Wang &amp; Nyima, ''The Historical Status of China's Tibet'', 37.&lt;/ref&gt; They state that the Ming dynasty, by issuing imperial edicts to invite ex-Yuan officials to the court for official positions in the early years of its founding, won submission from ex-Yuan religious and administrative leaders in the Tibetan areas, and thereby incorporated Tibetan areas into the rule of the Ming court. Thus, they conclude, the Ming court won the power to rule Tibetan areas formerly under the rule of the Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref name="wang nyima 37" /&gt;

Journalist and author Thomas Laird, in his book ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama'', writes that Wang and Nyima present the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|government viewpoint of the People's Republic of China]] in their ''Historical Status of China's Tibet'', and fail to realize that China was "absorbed into a larger, non-Chinese political unit" during the Mongol Yuan dynasty, which Wang and Nyima paint as a characteristic Chinese dynasty succeeded by the Ming.&lt;ref name="laird 106 107"&gt;Thomas Laird, ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama'' (New York: Grove Press, 2006), 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; Laird asserts that the ruling Mongol khans never administered Tibet as part of China and instead ruled them as separate territories, comparing the Mongols with the British who colonized India and New Zealand, yet stating this does not make India part of New Zealand as a consequence.&lt;ref name="laird 107"&gt;Laird, ''The Story of Tibet'', 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Of later Mongol and Tibetan accounts interpreting the Mongol conquest of Tibet, Laird asserts that "they, like all non-Chinese historical narratives, never portray the Mongol subjugation of Tibet as a Chinese one."&lt;ref name="laird 107" /&gt;

[[File:YuanEmperorAlbumKhubilaiPortrait.jpg|thumb|[[Kublai Khan]] (r. 1260–1294); Patricia Ann Berger writes that the [[Yongle Emperor]]'s patronage of [[Deshin Shekpa, 5th Karmapa Lama]], was an attempt to reassert a relationship with Tibet that Kublai Khan had earlier enjoyed with the [[Drogön Chögyal Phagpa]].&lt;ref name="berger 184" /&gt;]]

The ''[[Columbia Encyclopedia]]'' distinguishes between the Yuan dynasty and the other Mongol Empire khanates of [[Ilkhanate]], [[Chagatai Khanate]] and the [[Golden Horde]]. It describes the Yuan dynasty as "A Mongol dynasty of China that ruled from 1271 to 1368, and a division of the great empire conquered by the Mongols. Founded by Kublai Khan, who adopted the Chinese dynastic name of Yüan in 1271."&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition (2001–07).

Retrieved on 2008-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; although Tibetologist Thomas Laird dismissed the Yuan dynasty as a non-Chinese polity and plays down its Chinese characteristics. The Metropolitan Museum of Art also noted that in spite of the gradual assimilation of Yuan monarchs, the Mongol rulers largely ignored the literati and imposed harsh policies discriminating against southern Chinese.&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt; In his ''Kublai Khan: His Life and Times'', Rossabi explains that Kublai "created government institutions that either resembled or were the same as the traditional Chinese ones", and he "wished to signal to the Chinese that he intended to adopt the trappings and style of a Chinese ruler".&lt;ref name="rossabi 56"&gt;Rossabi, ''Khubilai Khan'', 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the [[Caste#Castes in China|ethno-geographic caste hierarchy]] favoring the Mongols and other ethnicities were accorded higher status than the Han Chinese majority. Although Han Chinese who were recruited as advisers were often actually more influential than high officials, their status was not as well defined. Kublai also abolished the [[imperial examination]]s of China's [[civil service]] legacy, which was not reinstated until [[Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan]]'s reign (1311–1320).&lt;ref name="rossabi 71 72 117"&gt;Rossabi, ''Khubilai Khan'', 30, 71–72, 117, 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Rossabi writes that Kublai recognized that in order to rule China, "he had to employ Chinese advisors and officials, yet he could not rely totally on Chinese advisers because he had to maintain a delicate balancing act between ruling the sedentary civilization of China and preserving the cultural identity and values of the Mongols."&lt;ref name="rossabi 115" /&gt; And "in governing China, he was concerned with the interests of his Chinese subjects, but also with exploiting the resources of the empire for his own aggrandizement. His motivations and objectives alternated from one to the other throughout his reign," according to Rossabi.&lt;ref name="rossabi 115 116"&gt;Rossabi, ''Khubilai Khan'', 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt; Van Praag writes in ''The Status of Tibet'' that the Tibetans and Mongols, on the other hand, upheld a dual system of rule and an interdependent relationship that legitimated the succession of Mongol khans as universal Buddhist rulers, or ''[[chakravartin]]''.&lt;ref name="van praag 6" /&gt; Van Praag writes that "Tibet remained a unique part of the Empire and was never fully integrated into it," citing examples such as a licensed border market that existed between China and Tibet during the Yuan.&lt;ref name="van praag 6" /&gt;

David M. Robinson contends that various edicts and laws issued by the Hongwu Emperor, founder of the Ming dynasty, seem to reject the Mongol influence in China with the banning of Mongolian marriage and burial practices, clothing, speech and even music.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, "The Ming Court and the Legacy of the Yuan Mongols", pp 367-368.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Robinson highlights how this rhetoric contradicts the Hongwu Emperor's continuation of Yuan institutions such as the hereditary garrison system [[Four occupations|and occupations]]. He initiated campaigns to conquer areas not previously controlled by native Chinese dynasties, including [[Ming conquest of Yunnan|territories in Yunnan]], [[Ming campaign against the Uriyangkhad horde|Liaodong (Manchuria)]], [[Battle of Buir Lake|and Mongolia]].&lt;ref name="robinson ming court 368"&gt;Robinson, "The Ming Court and the Legacy of the Yuan Mongols", p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to recruit Mongols into the military and maintained the Yuan-era tradition of bringing [[Koreans in China|Korean concubines and eunuchs]] into the imperial palace.&lt;ref name="robinson ming court 368"/&gt; Robinson claims that the Ming dynasty "was in many ways a true successor" to the Yuan, as the Ming emperors sought to legitimize their rule through the Yuan legacy, especially since the rival [[Northern Yuan Dynasty]] continued to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, "The Ming Court and the Legacy of the Yuan Mongols", p. 368-369.&lt;/ref&gt; The Yongle Emperor was far more explicit in invoking a comparison between his rule and that of Kublai Khan, as reflected in his very active [[Foreign relations of Imperial China|foreign policy]], [[Treasure voyages|projection of Ming Chinese power abroad]] and [[Military conquests of the Ming dynasty|expansionist military campaigns]].&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, "The Ming Court and the Legacy of the Yuan Mongols", pp 369-370.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 1449 [[Tumu Crisis]], the Ming government actively discouraged further immigration of Mongol peoples (favoring occasional relocation policies for those who already lived in China).&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, "Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China", pp 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Mongols continued to serve as Ming military officers even after Mongol involvement in the failed 1461 [[Rebellion of Cao Qin]], yet their numbers began to decline as hereditary officers in general were gradually replaced by men of more humble origins.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, "Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China", pp 116-117.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ming practices of giving titles to Tibetans ====
The official position of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China]] is that the Ming implemented a policy of managing Tibet according to conventions and customs, granting titles and setting up administrative organs over Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China (November 15, 2000). [http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/ljzg/3585/3592/3596/t17963.htm "Did Tibet Become an Independent Country after the Revolution of 1911?"]. Retrieved on 2008-05-02.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[State Council Information Office]] of the People's Republic states that the Ming dynasty's Ü-Tsang Commanding Office governed most areas of Tibet.&lt;ref name="information office of the state council 73"&gt;Information Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, ''Testimony of History'' (China Intercontinental Press, 2002), 73.&lt;/ref&gt; It also states that while the Ming abolished the policy council set up by the Mongol Yuan to manage local affairs in Tibet and the Mongol system of Imperial Tutors to govern religious affairs, the Ming adopted a policy of bestowing titles upon religious leaders who had submitted to the Ming dynasty.&lt;ref name="information office of the state council 73" /&gt; For example, an edict of the Hongwu Emperor in 1373 appointed the Tibetan leader Choskunskyabs as the General of the Ngari Military and Civil ''Wanhu'' Office, stating:&lt;ref name="information office of the state council 75" /&gt;
{{quote|I, the sovereign of the Empire, courteously treat people from all corners of the Empire who love righteousness and pledge allegiance to the Court and assign them official posts. I have learned with great pleasure that you, Chos-kun-skyabs, who live in the Western Region, inspired by my power and reputation, are loyal to the Court and capable of safeguarding the territory in your charge.

[[File:Chos kun Skyabs.png|thumb|right|Edict of the [[Hongwu Emperor]] granting the title General of the Ngari Military and Civil ''Wanhu'' Office to Tibetan leader Choskunskyabs in 1373]]
[[Chen Qingying]], Professor of History and Director of the History Studies Institute under the [[China Tibetology Research Center]] in Beijing, writes that the Ming court conferred new official positions on ex-Yuan Tibetan leaders of the Phachu Kargyu and granted them lower-ranking positions.&lt;ref name="chen 48"&gt;Chen, ''Tibetan History'', 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the county (zong or dzong) leaders of Neiwo Zong and Renbam Zong, Chen states that when "the Emperor learned the actual situation of the Phachu Kargyu, the Ming court then appointed the main Zong leaders to be senior officers of the Senior Command of Dbus and Gtsang."&lt;ref name="chen 48" /&gt; The official posts that the Ming court established in Tibet, such as senior and junior commanders, offices of Qianhu (in charge of 1,000 households), and offices of Wanhu (in charge of 10,000 households), were all hereditary positions according to Chen, but he asserts that "the succession of some important posts still had to be approved by the emperor," while old imperial mandates had to be returned to the Ming court for renewal.&lt;ref name="chen 48" /&gt;

According to Tibetologist John Powers, Tibetan sources counter this narrative of titles granted by the Chinese to Tibetans with various titles which the Tibetans gave to the Chinese emperors and their officials. Tribute missions from Tibetan monasteries to the Chinese court brought back not only titles, but large, commercially valuable gifts which could subsequently be sold. The Ming emperors sent invitations to ruling lamas, but the lamas sent subordinates rather than coming themselves, and no Tibetan ruler ever explicitly accepted the role of being a vassal of the Ming.&lt;ref name="Powers58 9"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 58–9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans Bielenstein]] writes that as far back as the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BCE–220 CE), the Han Chinese government "maintained the fiction" that the foreign officials administering the various "Dependent States" and [[oasis]] city-states of the [[Western Regions]] (composed of the [[Tarim Basin]] and oasis of [[Turpan]]) were true Han representatives due to the Han government's conferral of Chinese seals and seal cords to them.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Bielenstein, ''The Bureaucracy of Han Times'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1980), 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Changchub Gyaltsen ====
Wang and Nyima state that after the official title "Education Minister" was granted to [[Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen]] (1302–1364) by the Yuan court, this title appeared frequently with his name in various Tibetan texts, while his Tibetan title "Degsi" (''sic'' properly ''sde-srid'' or [[desi (Tibetan)|desi]]) is seldom mentioned.&lt;ref name="wang nyima 42"&gt;Wang &amp; Nyima, ''The Historical Status of China's Tibet'', 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Wang and Nyima take this to mean that "even in the later period of the Yuan dynasty, the Yuan imperial court and the [[Phagmodrupa Dynasty]] maintained a Central-local government relation."&lt;ref name="wang nyima 42" /&gt; The Tai Situpa is even supposed to have written in his will: "In the past I received loving care from the emperor in the east. If the emperor continues to care for us, please follow his edicts and the imperial envoy should be well received."&lt;ref name="wang nyima 42" /&gt;

[[File:Tsongkhapa.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of [[Je Tsongkhapa]], founder of the [[Gelug]], from a 19th-century painting]]

However, Lok-Ham Chan, a professor of history at the [[University of Washington]], writes that Changchub Gyaltsen's aims were to recreate the old Tibetan Kingdom that existed during the Chinese Tang dynasty, to build "nationalist sentiment" amongst Tibetans, and to "remove all traces of Mongol suzerainty."&lt;ref name="chan 262" /&gt; Georges Dreyfus, a professor of religion at [[Williams College]], writes that it was Changchub Gyaltsen who adopted the old administrative system of [[Songtsän Gampo]] (c. 605–649)—the first leader of the [[Tibetan Empire]] to establish Tibet as a strong power—by reinstating its legal code of punishments and administrative units.&lt;ref name="dreyfus 504"&gt;Georges Dreyfus, "Cherished memories, cherished communities: proto-nationalism in Tibet", in ''The History of Tibet: Volume 2, The Medieval Period: c. AD 850–1895, the Development of Buddhist Paramountcy'' (New York: Routledge, 2003), 504.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, instead of the 13 governorships established by the Mongol Sakya viceroy, Changchub Gyaltsen divided Central Tibet into districts (dzong) with district heads (dzong dpon) who had to conform to old rituals and wear clothing styles of old Imperial Tibet.&lt;ref name="dreyfus 504" /&gt; Van Praag asserts that Changchub Gyaltsen's ambitions were to "restore to Tibet the glories of its Imperial Age" by reinstating secular administration, promoting "national culture and traditions," and installing a law code that survived into the 20th century.&lt;ref name="van praag 7"&gt;Van Praag, ''The Status of Tibet'', 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Chen, the Ming officer of Hezhou (modern day [[Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture|Linxia]]) informed the Hongwu Emperor that the general situation in Dbus and Gtsang "was under control," and so he suggested to the emperor that he offer the second Phagmodru ruler, [[Jamyang Shakya Gyaltsen]], an official title.&lt;ref name="chen 44"&gt;Chen, ''Tibetan History'', 44.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Records of the Founding Emperor, the Hongwu Emperor issued an edict granting the title "Initiation State Master" to Sagya Gyaincain, while the latter sent envoys to the Ming court to hand over his jade seal of authority along with tribute of colored silk and satin, statues of the Buddha, Buddhist scriptures, and sarira.&lt;ref name="chen 44" /&gt;

Dreyfus writes that after the Phagmodrupa lost its centralizing power over Tibet in 1434, several attempts by other families to establish hegemonies failed over the next two centuries until 1642 with the [[5th Dalai Lama]]'s effective hegemony over Tibet.&lt;ref name="dreyfus 504" /&gt;

==== Je Tsongkhapa ====
The Ming dynasty granted titles to lamas of schools such as the Karmapa Kargyu, but the latter had previously declined Mongol invitations to receive titles.&lt;ref name="wylie 469 470"&gt;Wylie, "Lama Tribute in the Ming Dynasty", 469–470.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Ming Yongle Emperor invited [[Je Tsongkhapa]] (1357–1419), founder of the [[Gelug]] school, to come to the Ming court and pay tribute, the latter declined.&lt;ref name="wylie 469 470" /&gt; Wang and Nyima write that this was due to old age and physical weakness, and also because of efforts being made to build three major monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Wang &amp; Nyima, ''The Historical Status of China's Tibet'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Chen Qingying states that Tsongkhapa wrote a letter to decline the Emperor's invitation, and in this reply, Tsongkhapa wrote:&lt;ref name="chen 51" /&gt;
[[File:明宣宗.jpg|thumb|[[Xuande Emperor]] (r.&amp;nbsp;1425–1435)]]
{{quote|It is not that I don't know it is the edict of the Great dominator of the world for the sake of Buddhist doctrine, or that I do not obey the edict of Your Majesty.

[[A. Tom Grunfeld]] says that Tsongkhapa claimed ill health in his refusal to appear at the Ming court,&lt;ref name="grunfeld 40"&gt;A. Tom Grunfeld, ''The Making of Modern Tibet'' (New York: M.E. Sharpe, Inc., 1996), 40.&lt;/ref&gt; while Rossabi adds that Tsongkhapa cited the "length and arduousness of the journey" to China as another reason not to make an appearance.&lt;ref name="rossabi 244" /&gt; This first request by the Ming was made in 1407, but the Ming court sent another embassy in 1413, this one led by the eunuch Hou Xian (候顯; fl. 1403–1427), which was again refused by Tsongkhapa.&lt;ref name="rossabi 244" /&gt; Rossabi writes that Tsongkhapa did not want to entirely alienate the Ming court, so he sent his disciple Chosrje Shākya Yeshes to Nanjing in 1414 on his behalf, and upon his arrival in 1415 the Yongle Emperor bestowed upon him the title of "State Teacher"—the same title earlier awarded the Phagmodrupa ruler of Tibet.&lt;ref name="wylie 469 470" /&gt;&lt;ref name="grunfeld 40" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rossabi 244" /&gt; The [[Xuande Emperor]] (r.&amp;nbsp;1425–1435) even granted this disciple Chosrje Shākya Yeshes the title of a "King" (王).&lt;ref name="wylie 469 470" /&gt; This title does not appear to have held any practical meaning, or to have given its holder any power, at Tsongkhapa's [[Ganden Monastery]]. Wylie notes that this—like the Karma Kargyu—cannot be seen as a reappointment of Mongol Yuan offices, since the Gelug school was created after the fall of the Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref name="wylie 469 470" /&gt;

==== Implications on the question of rule ====

Dawa Norbu argues that modern [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] historians tend to be in favor of the view that the Ming simply reappointed old Yuan dynasty officials in Tibet and perpetuated their rule of Tibet in this manner.&lt;ref name="norbu 58"&gt;Dawa Norbu, ''China's Tibet Policy'' (Richmond: Curzon, 2001), 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Norbu writes that, although this would have been true for the eastern Tibetan regions of Amdo and Kham's "tribute-cum-trade" relations with the Ming, it was untrue if applied to the western Tibetan regions of Ü-Tsang and Ngari. After the Phagmodrupa Changchub Gyaltsen, these were ruled by "three successive nationalistic regimes," which Norbu writes "Communist historians prefer to ignore."&lt;ref name="norbu 58" /&gt;

Laird writes that the Ming appointed titles to eastern Tibetan princes, and that "these alliances with eastern Tibetan principalities are the evidence China now produces for its assertion that the Ming ruled Tibet," despite the fact that the Ming did not send an army to replace the Mongols after they left Tibet.&lt;ref name="laird 137" /&gt; Yiu Yung-chin states that the furthest western extent of the Ming dynasty's territory was [[Gansu]], [[Sichuan]], and [[Yunnan]] while "the Ming did not possess Tibet."&lt;ref name="yiu 121"&gt;Yiu Yung-chin, "Two Focuses of the Tibet Issue", in ''Tibet Through Dissident Chinese Eyes: Essays on Self-determination'' (New York: M.E. Sharpe, Inc., 1998), 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shih-Shan Henry Tsai writes that the Yongle Emperor sent his eunuch Yang Sanbao into Tibet in 1413 to gain the allegiance of various Tibetan princes, while the Yongle Emperor paid a small fortune in return gifts for tributes in order to maintain the loyalty of neighboring vassal states such as [[Nepal]] and Tibet.&lt;ref name="tsai 187 188"&gt;Shih-Shan Henry Tsai, ''Perpetual Happiness: The Ming Emperor Yongle'' (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2001), 187–188.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Van Praag states that Tibetan rulers upheld their own separate relations with the kingdoms of Nepal and [[Kashmir]], and at times "engaged in armed confrontation with them."&lt;ref name="van praag 8" /&gt;

[[File:明太宗.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Yongle Emperor]] (r. 1402–1424)]]

Even though the Gelug exchanged gifts with and sent missions to the Ming court up until the 1430s,&lt;ref name="chan 263" /&gt; the Gelug was not mentioned in the ''[[Mingshi]]'' or the ''[[Ming Shilu]]''.&lt;ref name="wylie 470" /&gt; On this, historian Li Tieh-tseng says of Tsongkhapa's refusal of Ming invitations to visit the Yongle Emperor's court:&lt;ref name="wylie 470" /&gt;
{{quote|In China not only the emperor could do no wrong, but also his prestige and dignity had to be upheld at any cost.

Wylie asserts that this type of [[censorship]] of the ''History of Ming'' distorts the true picture of the history of Sino-Tibetan relations, while the Ming court granted titles to various lamas regardless of their sectarian affiliations in an ongoing civil war in Tibet between competing Buddhist factions.&lt;ref name="wylie 470 471"&gt;Wylie, "Lama Tribute in the Ming Dynasty", 470–471.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="riggs 226"&gt;Riggs, "Tibet in Extremis", ''Far Eastern Survey'' 19, no. 21 (1950): 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Wylie argues that Ming titles of "King" granted indiscriminately to various Tibetan lamas or even their disciples should not be viewed as reappointments to earlier Yuan dynasty offices, since the viceregal Sakya regime established by the Mongols in Tibet was overthrown by the Phagmodru myriarchy before the Ming existed.&lt;ref name="wylie 468 469"&gt;Wylie, "Lama Tribute in the Ming Dynasty", 468–469.&lt;/ref&gt;

Helmut Hoffman states that the Ming upheld the facade of rule over Tibet through periodic missions of "tribute emissaries" to the Ming court and by granting nominal titles to ruling lamas, but did not actually interfere in Tibetan governance.&lt;ref name="hoffman 65" /&gt; Melvyn C.

In his usurpation of the throne from the [[Jianwen Emperor]] (r.&amp;nbsp;1398–1402), the Yongle Emperor was aided by the Buddhist monk Yao Guangxiao, and like his father, the Hongwu Emperor, the Yongle Emperor was "well-disposed towards Buddhism", claims Rossabi.&lt;ref name="rossabi 242" /&gt; On March 10, 1403, the Yongle Emperor invited [[Deshin Shekpa, 5th Karmapa Lama]] (1384–1415), to his court, even though the fourth Karmapa had rejected the invitation of the Hongwu Emperor.&lt;ref name="dictionary of ming biography 482"&gt;The Ming Biographical History Project of the Association for Asian Studies, ''Dictionary of Ming Biography, 1368–1644: 明代名人傳: Volume 1, A-L'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1976), 482.&lt;/ref&gt; A Tibetan translation in the 16th century preserves the letter of the Yongle Emperor, which the [[Association for Asian Studies]] notes is polite and complimentary towards the Karmapa.&lt;ref name="dictionary of ming biography 482" /&gt; The letter of invitation reads,{{quote|My father and both parents of the queen are now dead.

In order to seek out the Karmapa, the Yongle Emperor dispatched his eunuch Hou Xian and the Buddhist monk Zhi Guang (d. 1435) to Tibet.&lt;ref name="tsai 84"&gt;Tsai, ''Perpetual Happiness'', 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Traveling to Lhasa either through [[Qinghai]] or via the [[Silk Road]] to [[Khotan]], Hou Xian and Zhi Guang did not return to [[Nanjing]] until 1407.&lt;ref name="tsai 187"&gt;Tsai, ''Perpetual Happiness'', 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his travels beginning in 1403, Deshin Shekpa was induced by further exhortations by the Ming court to visit Nanjing by April 10, 1407.&lt;ref name="dictionary of ming biography 482" /&gt; Norbu writes that the Yongle Emperor, following the tradition of Mongol emperors and their reverence for the Sakya lamas, showed an enormous amount of deference towards Deshin Shekpa. The Yongle Emperor came out of the palace in Nanjing to greet the Karmapa and did not require him to [[kowtow]] like a tributary vassal.&lt;ref name="norbu 51 52"&gt;Norbu, ''China's Tibet Policy'', 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Karma Thinley, the emperor gave the Karmapa the place of honor at his left, and on a higher throne than his own.&lt;ref name="thinley 72" /&gt; Rossabi and others describe a similar arrangement made by Kublai Khan and the Sakya Phagpa lama, writing that Kublai would "sit on a lower platform than the Tibetan cleric" when receiving religious instructions from him.&lt;ref name="rossabi 41"&gt;Rossabi, ''Khubilai Khan'', 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powers53"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the following month, the Yongle Emperor and his court showered the Karmapa with presents.&lt;ref name="thinley 72" /&gt; At [[Linggu Temple]] in Nanjing, he presided over the religious ceremonies for the Yongle Emperor's deceased parents, while twenty-two days of his stay were marked by religious [[miracle]]s that were recorded in five languages on a gigantic scroll that bore the Emperor's seal.&lt;ref name="dictionary of ming biography 482" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tsai 84" /&gt; During his stay in Nanjing, Deshin Shekpa was bestowed the title "Great Treasure Prince of Dharma" by the Yongle Emperor.&lt;ref name="chen 52"&gt;Chen Qingying, ''Tibetan History'' (China Intercontinental Press, 2003), 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Elliot Sperling asserts that the Yongle Emperor, in bestowing Deshin Shekpa with the title of "King" and praising his [[Magic (paranormal)|mystical abilities]] and miracles, was trying to build an alliance with the Karmapa as the Mongols had with the Sakya lamas, but Deshin Shekpa rejected the Yongle Emperor's offer.&lt;ref name="sperling 477"&gt;Sperling, "The 5th Karma-pa and some aspects of the relationship between Tibet and the Early Ming", 477.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, this was the same title that Kublai Khan had offered the Sakya Phagpa lama, but Deshin Shekpa persuaded the Yongle Emperor to grant the title to religious leaders of other Tibetan Buddhist sects.&lt;ref name="rossabi 244"&gt;Rossabi, "The Ming and Inner Asia," 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karmapa5.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Deshin Shekpa]] (1384–1415)]]

Tibetan sources say Deshin Shekpa also persuaded the Yongle Emperor not to impose his military might on Tibet as the Mongols had previously done.&lt;ref name="dictionary of ming biography 482" /&gt; Thinley writes that before the Karmapa returned to Tibet, the Yongle Emperor began planning to send a military force into Tibet to forcibly give the Karmapa authority over all the Tibetan Buddhist schools but Deshin Shekpa dissuaded him.&lt;ref name="thinley 74"&gt;Thinley, ''The History of the Sixteen Karmapas of Tibet'', 74.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hok-Lam Chan states that "there is little evidence that this was ever the emperor's intention" and that evidence indicates that Deshin Skekpa was invited strictly for religious purposes.&lt;ref name="chan 263"&gt;Chan, "The Chien-wen, Yung-lo, Hung-shi, and Hsuan-te reigns", 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marsha Weidner states that Deshin Shekpa's miracles "testified to the power of both the emperor and his guru and served as a legitimizing tool for the emperor's problematic succession to the throne," referring to the Yongle Emperor's conflict with the previous Jianwen Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Marsha Weidner, "Imperial Engagements with Buddhist Art and Architecture: Ming Variations of an Old Theme", in ''Cultural Intersections in Later Chinese Buddhism'' (Manoa: University of Hawaii Press, 2001), 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Tsai writes that Deshin Shekpa aided the legitimacy of the Yongle Emperor's rule by providing him with portents and omens which demonstrated [[Mandate of Heaven|Heaven's favor]] of the Yongle Emperor on the Ming throne.&lt;ref name="tsai 84" /&gt;

With the example of the Ming court's relationship with the fifth Karmapa and other Tibetan leaders, Norbu states that Chinese Communist historians have failed to realize the significance of the religious aspect of the Ming-Tibetan relationship.&lt;ref name="norbu 52" /&gt; He writes that the meetings of lamas with the [[Emperor of China]] were exchanges of tribute between "the patron and the priest" and were not merely instances of a political subordinate paying tribute to a superior.&lt;ref name="norbu 52" /&gt; He also notes that the items of tribute were Buddhist artifacts which symbolized "the religious nature of the relationship."&lt;ref name="norbu 52" /&gt; Josef Kolmaš writes that the Ming dynasty did not exercise any direct political control over Tibet, content with their tribute relations that were "almost entirely of a religious character."&lt;ref name="kolmas 32"&gt;Kolmas, ''Tibet and Imperial China'', 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Ann Berger writes that the Yongle Emperor's courting and granting of titles to lamas was his attempt to "resurrect the relationship between China and Tibet established earlier by the Yuan dynastic founder Khubilai Khan and his guru [[Drogön Chögyal Phagpa|Phagpa]]."&lt;ref name="berger 184"&gt;Patricia Ann Berger, ''Empire of Emptiness: Buddhist Art and Political Authority in Qing China'' (Manoa: University of Hawaii Press, 2003), 184.&lt;/ref&gt; She also writes that the later Qing emperors and their Mongol associates viewed the Yongle Emperor's relationship with Tibet as "part of a chain of [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|reincarnation]] that saw this Han Chinese emperor as yet another emanation of [[Manjusri]]."&lt;ref name="berger 184" /&gt;

[[File:明英宗.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Zhengtong Emperor]] (r.&amp;nbsp;1435–1449)]]

The Information Office of the State Council of the PRC preserves an edict of the [[Zhengtong Emperor]] (r.&amp;nbsp;1435–1449) addressed to the Karmapa in 1445, written after the latter's agent had brought holy relics to the Ming court.&lt;ref name="information office of the state council 95"&gt;Information Office of the State Council, ''Testimony of History'', 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhengtong had the following message delivered to the Great Treasure Prince of Dharma, the Karmapa:
{{quote|Out of compassion, Buddha taught people to be good and persuaded them to embrace his doctrines. You, who live in the remote Western Region, have inherited the true Buddhist doctrines. I am deeply impressed not only by the compassion with which you preach among the people in your region for their enlightenment, but also by your respect for the wishes of Heaven and your devotion to the Court. I am very pleased that you have sent bSod-nams-nyi-ma and other Tibetan monks here bringing with them statues of Buddha, horses and other specialties as tributes to the court.&lt;ref name="information office of the state council 95" /&gt;}}
Despite this glowing message by the Emperor, Chan writes that a year later in 1446, the Ming court cut off all relations with the Karmapa hierarchs.&lt;ref name="chan 263" /&gt; Until then, the court was unaware that Deshin Shekpa had died in 1415.&lt;ref name="chan 263" /&gt; The Ming court had believed that the representatives of the Karma Kagyu who continued to visit the Ming capital were sent by the Karmapa.&lt;ref name="chan 263" /&gt;

Tsai writes that shortly after the visit by Deshin Shekpa, the Yongle Emperor ordered the construction of a road and of trading posts in the upper reaches of the [[Yangzi River|Yangzi]] and [[Mekong River]]s in order to facilitate trade with Tibet in tea, horses, and salt.&lt;ref name="tsai 187" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The Tea Horse Road in Historical Perspective', in: Forbes, Andrew, and Henley, David, ''China's Ancient Tea Horse Road''. Chiang Mai, Cognoscenti Books, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The trade route passed through Sichuan and crossed [[Shangri-La County]] in [[Yunnan]].&lt;ref name="tsai 187" /&gt; Wang and Nyima assert that this "tribute-related trade" of the Ming exchanging [[Chinese tea]] for Tibetan horses—while granting Tibetan envoys and Tibetan merchants explicit permission to trade with Han Chinese merchants—"furthered the rule of the Ming dynasty court over Tibet".&lt;ref name="wang nyima 39"&gt;Wang &amp; Nyima, ''The Historical Status of China's Tibet'', 39.
&lt;/ref&gt; Rossabi and Sperling note that this trade in Tibetan horses for Chinese tea existed long before the Ming.&lt;ref name="rossabi 243"&gt;
Rossabi, "The Ming and Inner Asia," 243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sperling 474 475"&gt;Sperling, "The 5th Karma-pa and some aspects of the relationship between Tibet and the Early Ming", 474–475.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter C. Perdue says that [[Wang Anshi]] (1021–1086), realizing that China could not produce enough militarily capable steeds, had also aimed to obtain horses from Inner Asia in exchange for Chinese tea.&lt;ref name="perdue 273"&gt;
Peter C. Perdue, "Culture, History, and Imperial Chinese Strategy: Legacies of the Qing Conquests", in ''Warfare in Chinese History'' (Leiden: Koninklijke Brill, 2000), 273.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese needed horses not only for cavalry but also as draft animals for the army's supply wagons.&lt;ref name="perdue 273" /&gt; The Tibetans required Chinese tea not only as a common beverage but also as a religious ceremonial supplement.&lt;ref name="rossabi 243" /&gt; The Ming government imposed a monopoly on tea production and attempted to regulate this trade with state-supervised markets, but these collapsed in 1449 due to military failures and internal ecological and commercial pressures on the tea-producing regions.&lt;ref name="rossabi 243" /&gt;&lt;ref name="perdue 273" /&gt;

Van Praag states that the Ming court established diplomatic delegations with Tibet merely to secure urgently needed horses.&lt;ref name="wang Nyima 39 40"&gt;
Wang &amp; Nyima, ''The Historical Status of China's Tibet'', 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Wang and Nyima argue that these were not diplomatic delegations at all, that Tibetan areas were ruled by the Ming since Tibetan leaders were granted positions as Ming officials, that horses were collected from Tibet as a mandatory "[[corvée]]" tax, and therefore Tibetans were "undertaking domestic affairs, not foreign diplomacy".&lt;ref name="wang nyima 40"&gt;
Wang &amp; Nyima, ''The Historical Status of China's Tibet'' 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Sperling writes that the Ming simultaneously bought horses in the Kham region while fighting Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing.&lt;ref name="sperling 475"&gt;Elliot Sperling, "The 5th Karma-pa and some aspects of the relationship between Tibet and the Early Ming", in ''The History of Tibet: Volume 2, The Medieval Period: c. AD 850–1895, the Development of Buddhist Paramountcy'' (New York: Routledge, 2003), 475.
&lt;/ref&gt; He also argues that the embassies of Tibetan lamas visiting the Ming court were for the most part efforts to promote commercial transactions between the lamas' large, wealthy entourage and Ming Chinese merchants and officials.&lt;ref name="sperling 478"&gt;
Sperling, "The 5th Karma-pa and some aspects of the relationship between Tibet and the Early Ming", 478.&lt;/ref&gt; Kolmaš writes that while the Ming maintained a [[laissez-faire]] policy towards Tibet and limited the numbers of the Tibetan retinues, the Tibetans sought to maintain a tributary relationship with the Ming because imperial patronage provided them with wealth and power.&lt;ref name="kolmas 28 29"&gt;
Kolmas, ''Tibet and Imperial China'', 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Laird writes that Tibetans eagerly sought Ming court invitations since the gifts the Tibetans received for bringing tribute were much greater in value than the latter.&lt;ref name="laird 131"&gt;
Laird, ''The Story of Tibet'', 131.&lt;/ref&gt; As for the Yongle Emperor's gifts to his Tibetan and [[Nepal]]ese vassals such as silver wares, Buddha relics, utensils for Buddhist temples and religious ceremonies, and gowns and robes for monks, Tsai writes "in his effort to draw neighboring states to the Ming orbit so that he could bask in glory, the Yongle Emperor was quite willing to pay a small price".&lt;ref name="tsai 188"&gt;Tsai, ''Perpetual Happiness'', 188.
&lt;/ref&gt; The Information Office of the State Council of the PRC lists the Tibetan tribute items as oxen, horses, camels, sheep, fur products, medical herbs, Tibetan incenses, ''[[thangka]]s'' (painted scrolls), and handicrafts; while the Ming awarded Tibetan tribute-bearers an equal value of gold, silver, satin and brocade, bolts of cloth, grains, and tea leaves.&lt;ref name="information office of the state council 73" /&gt; [[Silk]] workshops during the Ming also catered specifically to the Tibetan market with silk clothes and furnishings featuring Tibetan Buddhist iconography.&lt;ref name="vollmer 98 100"&gt;
John E. Vollmer, ''Silk for Thrones and Altars: Chinese Costumes and Textiles from the Liao through the Qing Dynasty'' (Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 2004), 98–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Ming dynasty traded horses with Tibet, it upheld a policy of outlawing border markets in the north, which Laird sees as an effort to punish the Mongols for their raids and to "drive them from the frontiers of China."&lt;ref name="laird 141"&gt;
Laird, ''The Story of Tibet'', 141.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after [[Altan Khan]] (1507–1582)—leader of the Tümed Mongols who overthrew the [[Oirats|Oirat Mongol]] confederation's hegemony over the steppes—made peace with the Ming dynasty in 1571, he persuaded the Ming to reopen their border markets in 1573.&lt;ref name="laird 141" /&gt; This provided the Chinese with a new supply of horses that the Mongols had in excess; it was also a relief to the Ming, since they were unable to stop the Mongols from periodic raiding.&lt;ref name="laird 141" /&gt; Laird says that despite the fact that later Mongols believed Altan forced the Ming to view him as an equal, Chinese historians argue that he was simply a loyal Chinese citizen.&lt;ref name="laird 141" /&gt; By 1578, Altan Khan formed a formidable Mongol-Tibetan alliance with the Gelug that the Ming viewed from afar without intervention.&lt;ref name="goldstein 8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kolmas 31 32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="laird 144" /&gt;

=== Armed intervention and border stability ===

Patricia Ebrey writes that Tibet, like [[Joseon|Joseon Korea]] and other neighboring states to the Ming, settled for its tributary status while there were no troops or governors of Ming China stationed in its territory.&lt;ref name="ebrey 227" /&gt; Laird writes that "after the Mongol troops left Tibet, no Ming troops replaced them."&lt;ref name="laird 137"&gt;Laird, ''The Story of Tibet'', 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Wang and Nyima state that, despite the fact that the Ming refrained from sending troops to subdue Tibet and refrained from garrisoning Ming troops there, these measures were unnecessary so long as the Ming court upheld close ties with Tibetan vassals and their forces.&lt;ref name="wang nyima 38"&gt;Wang &amp; Nyima, ''The Historical Status of China's Tibet'', 38.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were instances in the 14th century when the Hongwu Emperor did use military force to quell unrest in Tibet. John D. Langlois writes that there was unrest in Tibet and western [[Sichuan]], which the Marquis Mu Ying (沐英) was commissioned to quell in November 1378 after he established a Taozhou garrison in [[Gansu]].&lt;ref name="langlois 139"&gt;John D. Langlois, "The Hung-wu reign, 1368–1398", in ''The Cambridge History of China: Volume 7, The Ming Dynasty, 1368–1644, Part 1'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Langlois notes that by October 1379, Mu Ying had allegedly captured 30,000 Tibetan prisoners and 200,000 domesticated animals.&lt;ref name="langlois 139" /&gt; Yet invasion went both ways; the Ming general Qu Neng, under the command of Lan Yu, was ordered to repel a Tibetan assault into Sichuan in 1390.&lt;ref name="langlois 161"&gt;Langlois, "The Hung-wu reign, 1368–1398", 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Ming princes was noted for delinquent behavior involving Tibetans. [[Zhu Shuang]] (Prince of Qin), a son of the Hongwu Emperor, had some Tibetan boys castrated and Tibetan women seized while under the influence of drugs, following a war against minority Tibetan peoples. After his death in 1395 from either a drug overdose or toxins mixed with his medicine, Zhu Shuang was posthumously reprimanded by his father for various actions, including those against Tibetan prisoners of war (involving the slaughter of nearly two-thousand captives).&lt;ref&gt;Chan, "Ming Taizu's Problem with His Sons," pp 74-77, 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Noel 2005 Pékin tombeaux Ming voie des âmes 18.jpg|thumb|left|An armed and armored guard from the [[Ming Tombs]].]]
Discussions of strategy in the mid Ming dynasty focused primarily on recovery of the [[Ordos Desert|Ordos region]], which the Mongols used as a rallying base to stage raids into Ming China.&lt;ref name="perdue 266 267"&gt;Perdue, "Culture, History, and Imperial Chinese Strategy", 266–267.&lt;/ref&gt; Norbu states that the Ming dynasty, preoccupied with the Mongol threat to the north, could not spare additional armed forces to enforce or back up their claim of sovereignty over Tibet; instead, they relied on "Confucian instruments of tribute relations" of heaping unlimited number of titles and gifts on Tibetan lamas through acts of diplomacy.&lt;ref name="norbu 59"&gt;Norbu, ''China's Tibet Policy'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Sperling states that the delicate relationship between the Ming and Tibet was "the last time a united China had to deal with an independent Tibet," that there was a potential for armed conflict at their borders, and that the ultimate goal of Ming foreign policy with Tibet was not subjugation but "avoidance of any kind of Tibetan threat."&lt;ref name="sperling 475 477"&gt;Sperling, "The 5th Karma-pa and some aspects of the relationship between Tibet and the Early Ming", 475–477.&lt;/ref&gt; P. Christiaan Klieger argues that the Ming court's patronage of high Tibetan lamas "was designed to help stabilize border regions and protect trade routes."&lt;ref name="klieger 217" /&gt;

Historians Luciano Petech and Sato Hisashi argue that the Ming upheld a "divide-and-rule" policy towards a weak and politically fragmented Tibet after the Sakya regime had fallen.&lt;ref name="norbu 58" /&gt; Chan writes that this was perhaps the calculated strategy of the Yongle Emperor, as exclusive patronage to one Tibetan sect would have given it too much regional power.&lt;ref name="chan 263 264"&gt;Chan, "The Chien-wen, Yung-lo, Hung-shi, and Hsuan-te reigns", 263–264.&lt;/ref&gt; Sperling finds no textual evidence in either Chinese or Tibetan sources to support this thesis of Petech and Hisashi.&lt;ref name="norbu 58" /&gt; Norbu asserts that their thesis is largely based on the list of Ming titles conferred on Tibetan lamas rather than "comparative analysis of developments in China and Tibet."&lt;ref name="norbu 58" /&gt; Rossabi states that this theory "attributes too much influence to the Chinese," pointing out that Tibet was already politically divided when the Ming dynasty began.&lt;ref name="rossabi 243" /&gt; Rossabi also discounts the "divide-and-rule" theory on the grounds of the Yongle Emperor's failed attempt to build a strong relationship with the fifth Karmapa—one which he hoped would parallel Kublai Khan's earlier relationship with the Sakya Phagpa lama.&lt;ref name="rossabi 244" /&gt; Instead, the Yongle Emperor followed the Karmapa's advice of giving patronage to many different Tibetan lamas.&lt;ref name="rossabi 244" /&gt;

The Association for Asian Studies states that there is no known written evidence to suggest that later leaders of the Gelug—[[1st Dalai Lama|Gendün Drup]] (1391–1474) and [[2nd Dalai Lama|Gendün Gyatso]] (1475–1571)—had any contacts with Ming China.&lt;ref name="dictionary of ming biography 412 413"&gt;''Dictionary of Ming Biography'', 412–413.&lt;/ref&gt; These two religious leaders were preoccupied with an overriding concern for dealing with the powerful secular [[Rinpungpa]] princes, who were patrons and protectors of the Karma Kargyu lamas.&lt;ref name="dictionary of ming biography 412 413" /&gt; The Rinpungpa leaders were relatives of the Phagmodrupa, yet their authority shifted over time from simple governors to rulers in their own right over large areas of Ü-Tsang.&lt;ref name="cabezon dargyay 43 44 270"&gt;Jose Ignacio Cabezon and Geshe Lobsang Dargyay, ''Freedom from Extremes: Gorampa's Distinguishing the Views and the Polemics of Emptiness'' (Somerville: Wisdom Publications, 2007), 43–44, 270.&lt;/ref&gt; The prince of Rinbung occupied Lhasa in 1498 and excluded the Gelug from attending New Years ceremonies and prayers, the most important event in the Gelug.&lt;ref name="dictionary of ming biography 413"&gt;''Dictionary of Ming Biography'', 413.&lt;/ref&gt; While the task of New Years prayers in Lhasa was granted to the Karmapa and others, Gendün Gyatso traveled in exile looking for allies.&lt;ref name="dictionary of ming biography 413" /&gt; However, it was not until 1518 that the secular Phagmodru ruler captured Lhasa from the Rinbung, and thereafter the Gelug was given rights to conduct the New Years prayer.&lt;ref name="dictionary of ming biography 413" /&gt; When the [[Drikung Kagyu]] abbot of [[Drigung Monastery]] threatened Lhasa in 1537, Gendün Gyatso was forced to abandon the [[Drepung Monastery]], although he eventually returned.&lt;ref name="dictionary of ming biography 413" /&gt;

The [[Zhengde Emperor]] (r. 1505–1521), who enjoyed the company of lamas at court despite protests from the [[censorate]], had heard tales of a "living Buddha" which he desired to host at the Ming capital; this was none other than the Rinpung-supported [[Mikyö Dorje, 8th Karmapa Lama]] then occupying Lhasa.&lt;ref name="geiss 417"&gt;James Geiss, "The Cheng-te reign, 1506–1521", in ''The Cambridge History of China: Volume 7, The Ming Dynasty, 1368–1644, Part 1'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), 417.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhengde's top advisors made every attempt to dissuade him from inviting this lama to court, arguing that Tibetan Buddhism was wildly heterodox and unorthodox.&lt;ref name="tuttle 27" /&gt; Despite protests by the [[Grand Secretariat|Grand Secretary]] Liang Chu, in 1515 the Zhengde Emperor sent his eunuch official Liu Yun of the [[Chancellor (China)|Palace Chancellery]] on a mission to invite this Karmapa to Beijing.&lt;ref name="geiss 417 418"&gt;Geiss, "The Cheng-te reign, 1506–1521", 417–418.&lt;/ref&gt; Liu commanded a fleet of hundreds of ships requisitioned along the [[Yangtze]], consuming 2,835&amp;nbsp;g (100&amp;nbsp;oz) of silver a day in food expenses while stationed for a year in [[Chengdu]] of [[Sichuan]].&lt;ref name="geiss 418" /&gt; After procurring necessary gifts for the mission, he departed with a cavalry force of about 1,000&amp;nbsp;troops.&lt;ref name="geiss 418"&gt;Geiss, "The Cheng-te reign, 1506–1521", 418.&lt;/ref&gt; When the request was delivered, the Karmapa lama refused to leave Tibet despite the Ming force brought to coerce him.&lt;ref name="geiss 418" /&gt; The Karmapa launched a surprise ambush on Liu Yun's camp, seizing all the goods and valuables while killing or wounding half of Liu Yun's entire escort.&lt;ref name="geiss 418" /&gt; After this fiasco, Liu fled for his life, but only returned to Chengdu several years later to find that the Zhengde Emperor had died.&lt;ref name="geiss 418" /&gt;

=== Tibetans as a "national minority" ===

[[File:Ming-Empire2.jpg|thumb|According to this map of the Ming Empire during the [[Yongle Emperor]]'s reign, published by [[Harvard University Press]] in 1905, the boundaries shown do not include the Ming's vassal states, while Tibet is noticeably absent from the Ming's sovereign territories or directly governed areas in yellow.]]
[[File:China Tibet.svg|thumb|The [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] in the [[People's Republic of China]]; Marina Illich states that PRC scholars bracket Tibet under a "[[Ethnic minorities in China|minority nationality]]" rubric which "narrowly conceives of geographic Tibet as a modern-day Tibet Autonomous Region (T.A.R.) abutted by a congeries of 'Tibetan prefectures' in&amp;nbsp;... Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu, and Yunnan," while the historic definition of Tibet is portrayed anachronistically as an "[[Zhonghua minzu|inalienable part of China]]."&lt;ref name="illich 19" /&gt;]]

Elliot Sperling, a specialist of Indian studies and the director of the Tibetan Studies program at [[Indiana University]]’s Department of Central Eurasia Studies, writes that "the idea that Tibet became part of China in the 13th century is a very recent construction."&lt;ref name="sperling New York Times"&gt;Sperling, Elliot. (April 13, 2008). [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/13/opinion/13sperling.html?ref=opinion Don't Know Much About Tibetan History]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved on 2008-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that Chinese writers of the early 20th century were of the view that Tibet was not annexed by China until the Manchu Qing dynasty invasion during the 18th century.&lt;ref name="sperling New York Times" /&gt; He also states that Chinese writers of the early 20th century described Tibet as a feudal dependency of China, not an integral part of it.&lt;ref name="sperling New York Times" /&gt; Sperling states that this is because "Tibet was ruled as such, within the empires of the Mongols and the Manchus" and also that "China's intervening Ming dynasty&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;had no control over Tibet."&lt;ref name="sperling New York Times" /&gt; He writes that the Ming relationship with Tibet is problematic for China’s insistence of its unbroken sovereignty over Tibet since the 13th century.&lt;ref name="sperling New York Times" /&gt; As for the Tibetan view that Tibet was never subject to the rule of the Yuan or Qing emperors of China, Sperling also discounts this by stating that Tibet was "subject to rules, laws and decisions made by the Yuan and Qing rulers" and that even Tibetans described themselves as subjects of these emperors.&lt;ref name="sperling New York Times" /&gt;

Josef Kolmaš, a [[sinologist]], [[:Category:Tibetologists|Tibetologist]], and Professor of Oriental Studies at the [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic]], writes that it was during the Qing dynasty "that developments took place on the basis of which Tibet came to be considered an organic part of China, both practically and theoretically subject to the Chinese central government."&lt;ref name="kolmas 33"&gt;Kolmas, ''Tibet and Imperial China'', 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet he states that this was a radical change in regards to all previous eras of Sino-Tibetan relations.&lt;ref name="kolmas 33" /&gt;

P. Christiaan Klieger, an anthropologist and scholar of the [[California Academy of Sciences]] in San Francisco, writes that the vice royalty of the Sakya regime installed by the Mongols established a [[patron and priest relationship]] between Tibetans and Mongol converts to Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref name="klieger 217"&gt;P. Christiaan Klieger, "Riding High on the Manchurian Dream: Three Paradigms in the Construction of the Tibetan Question", in ''Contemporary Tibet: Politics, Development, and Society in a Disputed Region'' (New York: M.E. Sharpe, Inc., 2006), 217.&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, the Tibetan lamas and Mongol khans upheld a "mutual role of religious prelate and secular patron," respectively.&lt;ref name="klieger 217" /&gt; He adds that "Although agreements were made between Tibetan leaders and Mongol khans, Ming and Qing emperors, it was the Republic of China and its Communist successors that assumed the former imperial tributaries and subject states as integral parts of the Chinese nation-state."&lt;ref name="klieger 217" /&gt;

Marina Illich, a scholar of Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, while discussing the life of the Gelug lama Chankya Rolpe Dorje (1717–1786), mentions the limitations of both Western and Chinese modern scholarship in their interpretation of Tibetan sources. As for the limitations imposed on scholars by the central government of the People's Republic of China on issues regarding the history of Tibet, Illich writes:&lt;ref name="illich 19" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;PRC scholars ... work under the strict supervision of censor bureaus and must adhere to historiographic guidelines issued by the state [and] have little choice but to frame their discussion of eighteenth-century Tibetan history in the anachronistic terms of contemporary People's Republic of China (P.R.C.) state discourse&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;Bound by Party directives, these scholars have little choice but to portray Tibet as a trans-historically inalienable part of China in a way that profoundly obscures questions of Tibetan agency.&lt;ref name="illich 19"&gt;Marina Illich, "Imperial Stooge or Emissary to the Dge lugs Throne?

''[[China Daily]]'', a [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP-controlled]] news organization since 1981, states in a 2008 article that although there were dynastic changes after Tibet was incorporated into the territory of Yuan dynasty's China in the 13th century, "Tibet has remained under the jurisdiction of the central government of China."&lt;ref name="china daily"&gt;''[[China Daily]]''.

=== Altan Khan and the Dalai Lama ===
[[File:明世宗.jpg|thumb|[[Jiajing Emperor]] (r. 1521–1567)]]
During the reign of the [[Jiajing Emperor]] (r. 1521–1567), the native Chinese ideology of [[Taoism|Daoism]] was fully sponsored at the Ming court, while Tibetan [[Vajrayana]] and even [[Chinese Buddhism]] were ignored or suppressed.&lt;ref name="wylie 470" /&gt; Even the ''History of Ming'' states that the Tibetan lamas discontinued their trips to Ming China and its court at this point.&lt;ref name="wylie 470" /&gt; Grand Secretary [[Yang Tinghe]] under Jiajing was determined to break the [[eunuch]] influence at court which typified the Zhengde era,&lt;ref name="wills 338 339"&gt;John E. Wills, Jr., "Relations with Maritime Europe, 1514–1662", in ''The Cambridge History of China: Volume 8, The Ming Dynasty, 1368–1644, Part 2'', 333–375, ed. Denis Twitchett, John King Fairbank, and Albert Feuerwerker (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), 338–339.&lt;/ref&gt; an example being the costly escort of the eunuch Liu Yun as described above in his failed mission to Tibet. The court eunuchs were in favor of expanding and building new commercial ties with foreign countries such as [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], which Zhengde deemed permissible since he had an affinity for foreign and exotic people.&lt;ref name="wills 338 339" /&gt;

With the death of Zhengde and ascension of Jiajing, the politics at court shifted in favor of the [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian establishment]] which not only rejected the Portuguese embassy of [[Fernão Pires de Andrade]] (d. 1523),&lt;ref name="wills 338 339" /&gt; but had a predisposed animosity towards Tibetan Buddhism and lamas.&lt;ref name="geiss 417 418" /&gt; [[Evelyn Rawski|Evelyn S. Rawski]], a professor in the Department of History of the [[University of Pittsburgh]], writes that the Ming's unique relationship with Tibetan prelates essentially ended with Jiajing's reign while Ming influence in the Amdo region was supplanted by the Mongols.&lt;ref name="rawski 245"&gt;Evelyn S. Rawski, ''The Last Emperors: A Social History of Qing Imperial Institutions'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998), 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] also deliberately helped to propagate Tibetan Buddhism instead of Chinese Buddhism among the Mongols. The Ming assisted [[Altan Khan]], King of the [[Tumed|Tümed Mongols]], when he requested aid in propagating Lamaism.&lt;ref name="Taveirne2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Taveirne|title=Han-Mongol Encounters and Missionary Endeavors: A History of Scheut in Ordos (Hetao) 1874-1911|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z2japTNPRNAC&amp;pg=PA67|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Leuven University Press|isbn=978-90-5867-365-7|pages=67–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the [[Tumed]] Mongols began moving into the Kokonor region (modern [[Qinghai]]), raiding the Ming Chinese frontier and even as far as the suburbs of Beijing under [[Altan Khan]] (1507–1582).&lt;ref name="wylie 470" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David M. Robinson, "Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China: Mongols and the Abortive Coup of 1461", in ''Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies'' 59, no. 1 (June 1999): 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Klieger writes that Altan Khan's presence in the west effectively reduced Ming influence and contact with Tibet.&lt;ref name="klieger 217 218"&gt;Klieger, "Riding High on the Manchurian Dream", 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt; After Altan Khan made peace with the Ming dynasty in 1571, he invited the third hierarch of the Gelug—[[3rd Dalai Lama|Sönam Gyatso]] (1543–1588)—to meet him in Amdo (modern [[Qinghai]]) in 1578, where he accidentally bestowed him and his two predecessors with the title of [[Dalai Lama]]—"Ocean Teacher".&lt;ref name="wylie 470" /&gt;&lt;ref name="karmay 3"&gt;Samten Karmay, ''Secret Visions of the Fifth Dalai Lama'' (London: Serindia Publications, 1988), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The full title was "Dalai Lama Vajradhara", "Vajradhara" meaning "Holder of the Thunderbolt" in [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref name="karmay 3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kolmas 31" /&gt; Victoria Huckenpahler notes that [[Vajradhara]] is considered by Buddhists to be the primordial Buddha of limitless and all-pervasive beneficial qualities, a being that "represents the ultimate aspect of enlightenment."&lt;ref name="huckenpahler viii"&gt;Victoria Huckenpahler, "Introduction," in ''The Great Kagyu Masters: The Golden Lineage Treasury'' (Ithica: Snow Lion Publications, 1990), xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein writes that Sönam Gyatso also enhanced Altan Khan's standing by granting him the title "king of religion, majestic purity".&lt;ref name="goldstein 8"&gt;Goldstein, ''The Snow Lion and the Dragon'', 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama officially recognized Altan Khan as the "Protector of the Faith".&lt;ref name="rawski 246" /&gt;
[[File:Potala Palace, August 2009.jpg|thumb|left|275px|The [[Potala Palace]] at [[Lhasa]] became the chief residence of the [[Dalai Lama]] beginning with the [[5th Dalai Lama]].]]
Laird writes that Altan Khan abolished the native Mongol practices of [[shamanism]] and blood sacrifice, while the Mongol princes and subjects were coerced by Altan to convert to Gelug Buddhism—or face execution if they persisted in their shamanistic ways.&lt;ref name="laird 143 144"&gt;Laird, ''The Story of Tibet'', 143–144.&lt;/ref&gt; Committed to their religious leader, Mongol princes began requesting the Dalai Lama to bestow titles on them, which demonstrated "the unique fusion of religious and political power" wielded by the Dalai Lama, as Laird writes.&lt;ref name="laird 146" /&gt; Kolmaš states that the spiritual and secular Mongol-Tibetan alliance of the 13th century was renewed by this alliance constructed by Altan Khan and Sönam Gyatso.&lt;ref name="kolmas 30 31"&gt;Kolmas, ''Tibet and Imperial China'', 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Van Praag writes that this restored the original Mongol patronage of a Tibetan lama and "to this day, Mongolians are among the most devout followers of the Gelugpa and the Dalai Lama."&lt;ref name="van praag 8 9"&gt;Van Praag, ''The Status of Tibet'', 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Angela F. Howard writes that this unique relationship not only provided the Dalai Lama and [[Panchen Lama]] with religious and political authority in Tibet, but that Altan Khan gained "enormous power among the entire Mongol population."&lt;ref name="howard 13"&gt;Angela F. Howard, "Introduction", in ''Chinese Sculpture'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006), 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rawski writes that Altan Khan's conversion to the Gelug "can be interpreted as an attempt to expand his authority in his conflict with his nominal superior, [[Tümen Zasagt Khan|Tümen Khan]]."&lt;ref name="rawski 246"&gt;Rawski, ''The Last Emperors'', 246.&lt;/ref&gt; To further cement the Mongol-Tibetan alliance, the great-grandson of Altan Khan—the [[4th Dalai Lama]] (1589–1616)—was made the fourth Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name="wylie 470" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kolmas 31"&gt;Kolmas, ''Tibet and Imperial China'', 31.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1642, the 5th Dalai Lama (1617–1682) became the first to wield effective political control over Tibet.&lt;ref name="dreyfus 504" /&gt;

=== Contact with the Ming dynasty ===

[[File:明神宗.jpg|thumb|[[Wanli Emperor]] (r. 1572–1620)]]

Sonam Gyatso, after being granted the grandiose title by Altan Khan, departed for Tibet. Before he left, he sent a letter and gifts to the Ming Chinese official [[Zhang Juzheng]] (1525–1582), which arrived on March 12, 1579.&lt;ref name="dictionary of ming biography 23"&gt;''Dictionary of Ming Biography'', 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime in August or September of that year, Sonam Gyatso's representative stationed with Altan Khan received a return letter and gift from the [[Wanli Emperor]] (r.&amp;nbsp;1572–1620), who also conferred upon Sonam Gyatso a title; this was the first official contact between a Dalai Lama and a government of China.&lt;ref name="dictionary of ming biography 23" /&gt; However, Laird states that when Wanli invited him to Beijing, the Dalai Lama declined the offer due to a prior commitment, even though he was only {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Beijing.&lt;ref name="laird 146"&gt;Laird, ''The Story of Tibet'', 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Laird adds that "the power of the Ming emperor did not reach very far at the time."&lt;ref name="laird 146" /&gt; Although not recorded in any official Chinese records, Sonam Gyatso's biography states that Wanli again conferred titles on Sonam Gyatso in 1588, and invited him to Beijing for a second time, but Sonam Gyatso was unable to visit China as he died the same year in [[Mongolia]] working with Altan Khan's son to further the spread of Buddhism.&lt;ref name="laird 146" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dictionary of ming biography 23" /&gt;

Of the third Dalai Lama, ''China Daily'' states that the "Ming dynasty showed him special favor by allowing him to pay tribute."&lt;ref name="china daily" /&gt; ''China Daily'' then says that Sonam Gyatso was granted the title Dorjichang or Vajradhara Dalai Lama in 1587 [sic!],&lt;ref name="china daily" /&gt; but ''China Daily'' does not mention who granted him the title. Without mentioning the role of the Mongols, ''China Daily'' states that it was the successive Qing dynasty which established the title of ''Dalai Lama'' and his power in Tibet: "In 1653, the Qing emperor granted an honorific title to the fifth Dalai Lama and then did the same for the fifth Panchen Lama in 1713, officially establishing the titles of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, and their political and religious status in Tibet."&lt;ref name="china daily" /&gt;

Chen states that the fourth Dalai Lama Yonten Gyatso was granted the title "Master of Vajradhara" and an official seal by the Wanli Emperor in 1616.&lt;ref name="chen reincarnation 33"&gt;Chen Qingying, ''The System of the Dalai Lama Reincarnation'' (Beijing: China Intercontinental Press, 2005), 33.&lt;/ref&gt; This was noted in the ''Biography of the Fourth Dalai Lama'', which stated that one Soinam Lozui delivered the seal of the Emperor to the Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name="chen reincarnation 33" /&gt; The Wanli Emperor had invited Yonten Gyatso to Beijing in 1616, but just like his predecessor he died before being able to make the journey.&lt;ref name="chen reincarnation 33" /&gt;

Kolmaš writes that, as the Mongol presence in Tibet increased, culminating in the conquest of Tibet by a Mongol leader in 1642, the Ming emperors "viewed with apparent unconcern these developments in Tibet."&lt;ref name="kolmas 31 32" /&gt; He adds that the Ming court's lack of concern for Tibet was one of the reasons why the Mongols pounced on the chance to reclaim their old vassal of Tibet and "fill once more the political vacuum in that country."&lt;ref name="kolmas 32" /&gt; On the mass Mongol conversion to Tibetan Buddhism under Altan Khan, Laird writes that "the Chinese watched these developments with interest, though few Chinese ever became devout Tibetan Buddhists."&lt;ref name="laird 144"&gt;Laird, ''The Story of Tibet'', 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1565, the powerful [[Rinpungpa|Rinbung]] princes were overthrown by one of their own ministers, [[Karma Tseten]] who styled himself as the [[Tsangpa]], "the one of Tsang", and established his base of power at [[Shigatse]].&lt;ref name="kolmas 29"&gt;Kolmas, ''Tibet and Imperial China'', 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="karmay 3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="laird 152"&gt;Laird, ''The Story of Tibet'', 152.&lt;/ref&gt; The second successor of this first Tsang king, [[Karma Phuntsok Namgyal]], took control of the whole of Central Tibet ([[Ü-Tsang]]), reigning from 1611–1621.&lt;ref name="karmay 2"&gt;Karmay, ''Secret Visions of the Fifth Dalai Lama'', 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the leaders of Lhasa still claimed their allegiance to the Phagmodru as well as the Gelug, while the Ü-Tsang king allied with the Karmapa.&lt;ref name="karmay 2" /&gt; Tensions rose between the nationalistic Ü-Tsang ruler and the Mongols who safeguarded their Mongol Dalai Lama in Lhasa.&lt;ref name="karmay 3" /&gt; The fourth Dalai Lama refused to give an audience to the Ü-Tsang king, which sparked a conflict as the latter began assaulting Gelug monasteries.&lt;ref name="karmay 3" /&gt; Chen writes of the speculation over the fourth Dalai Lama's mysterious death and the plot of the Ü-Tsang king to have him murdered for "cursing" him with illness, although Chen writes that the murder was most likely the result of a feudal power struggle.&lt;ref name="chen reincarnation 33 34"&gt;Chen, ''The System of the Dalai Lama Reincarnation'', 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1618, only two years after Yonten Gyatso died, the Gelug and the Karma Kargyu went to war, the Karma Kargyu supported by the secular Ü-Tsang king.&lt;ref name="goldstein 6"&gt;Goldstein, ''The Snow Lion and the Dragon'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ü-Tsang ruler had a large number of Gelugpa lamas killed, occupied their monasteries at [[Drepung Monastery|Drepung]] and [[Sera Monastery|Sera]], and outlawed any attempts to find another Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name="goldstein 6" /&gt; In 1621, the Ü-Tsang king died and was succeeded by his young son [[Karma Tenkyong]], an event which stymied the war effort as the latter accepted the six-year-old Lozang Gyatso as the new Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name="karmay 3" /&gt; Despite the new Dalai Lama's diplomatic efforts to maintain friendly relations with the new Ü-Tsang ruler, [[Sonam Rapten]] (1595–1657), the Dalai Lama's chief steward and treasurer at Drepung, made efforts to overthrow the Ü-Tsang king, which led to another conflict.&lt;ref name="karmay 3 4"&gt;Karmay, ''Secret Visions of the Fifth Dalai Lama'', 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1633, the Gelugpas and several thousand Mongol adherents defeated the Ü-Tsang king's troops near Lhasa before a peaceful negotiation was settled.&lt;ref name="goldstein 6" /&gt; Goldstein writes that in this the "Mongols were again playing a significant role in Tibetan affairs, this time as the military arm of the Dalai Lama."&lt;ref name="goldstein 6" /&gt;

When an ally of the Ü-Tsang ruler threatened destruction of the Gelugpas again, the fifth Dalai Lama Lozang Gyatso pleaded for help from the Mongol prince [[Güshi Khan]] (1582–1655), leader of the Khoshut (Qoshot) tribe of the [[Oirats|Oirat Mongols]], who was then on a pilgrimage to Lhasa.&lt;ref name="kolmas 31" /&gt;&lt;ref name="goldstein 9"&gt;Goldstein, ''The Snow Lion and the Dragon'', 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="van praag 10"&gt;Van Praag, ''The Status of Tibet'', 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="karmay 4" /&gt; Güshi Khan accepted his role as protector, and from 1637–1640 he not only defeated the Gelugpas' enemies in the Amdo and Kham regions, but also resettled his entire tribe into Amdo.&lt;ref name="kolmas 31" /&gt;&lt;ref name="goldstein 9" /&gt; Sonam Chöpel urged Güshi Khan to assault the Ü-Tsang king's homebase of Shigatse, which Güshi Khan agreed upon, enlisting the aid of Gelug monks and supporters.&lt;ref name="goldstein 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="karmay 4" /&gt; In 1642, after a year's siege of Shigatse, the Ü-Tsang forces surrendered.&lt;ref name="karmay 4"&gt;Karmay, ''Secret Visions of the Fifth Dalai Lama'', 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Güshi Khan then captured and summarily executed [[Karma Tenkyong]], the ruler of Ü-Tsang, King of Tibet.&lt;ref name="goldstein 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="van praag 10" /&gt;

Soon after the victory in Ü-Tsang, Güshi Khan organized a welcoming ceremony for Lozang Gyatso once he arrived a day's ride from Shigatse, presenting his conquest of Tibet as a gift to the Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name="karmay 4" /&gt; In a second ceremony held within the main hall of the Shigatse fortress, Güshi Khan enthroned the Dalai Lama as the ruler of Tibet, but conferred the actual governing authority to the regent Sonam Chöpel.&lt;ref name="goldstein 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="van praag 10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="karmay 4" /&gt; Although Güshi Khan had granted the Dalai Lama "supreme authority" as Goldstein writes, the title of 'King of Tibet' was conferred upon Güshi Khan, spending his summers in pastures north of Lhasa and occupying Lhasa each winter.&lt;ref name="kolmas 31 32"&gt;Kolmas, ''Tibet and Imperial China'', 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goldstein 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="van praag 10 11"&gt;Van Praag, ''The Status of Tibet'', 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Van Praag writes that at this point Güshi Khan maintained control over the armed forces, but accepted his inferior status towards the Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name="van praag 10 11" /&gt; Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama shared power with his regent and Güshi Khan during his early secular and religious reign.&lt;ref name="rawski 250 251"&gt;Rawski, ''The Last Emperors'', 250–251.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rawski states that he eventually "expanded his own authority by presenting himself as [[Avalokiteśvara]] through the performance of rituals," by building the [[Potala Palace]] and other structures on traditional religious sites, and by emphasizing lineage reincarnation through written biographies.&lt;ref name="rawski 251"&gt;Rawski, ''The Last Emperors'', 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein states that the government of Güshi Khan and the Dalai Lama persecuted the Karma Kagyu sect, confiscated their wealth and property, and even converted their monasteries into Gelug monasteries.&lt;ref name="goldstein 9" /&gt; Rawski writes that this Mongol patronage allowed the Gelugpas to dominate the rival religious sects in Tibet.&lt;ref name="rawski 251" /&gt;

Meanwhile, the Chinese Ming dynasty fell to the rebellion of [[Li Zicheng]] (1606–1645) in 1644, yet his short-lived [[Shun dynasty]] was crushed by the [[Manchu]] invasion and the Han Chinese general [[Wu Sangui]] (1612–1678). ''China Daily'' states that when the following Qing dynasty replaced the Ming dynasty, it merely "strengthened administration of Tibet."&lt;ref name="china daily" /&gt; However, Kolmaš states that the Dalai Lama was very observant of what was going on in China and accepted a Manchu invitation in 1640 to send envoys to their capital at [[Mukden]] in 1642, before the Ming collapsed.&lt;ref name="kolmas 34 35"&gt;Kolmas, ''Tibet and Imperial China'', 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="van praag 11"&gt;Van Praag, ''The Status of Tibet'', 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Dawa Norbu, William Rockhill, and George N. Patterson write that when the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] (r.&amp;nbsp;1644–1661) of the subsequent Qing dynasty invited the fifth Dalai Lama Lozang Gyatso to Beijing in 1652, Shunzhi treated the Dalai Lama as an independent sovereign of Tibet.&lt;ref name="norbu 52"&gt;Norbu, ''China's Tibet Policy'', 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="patterson 89"&gt;Patterson, "China and Tibet: Background to the Revolt", 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Patterson writes that this was an effort of Shunzhi to secure an alliance with Tibet that would ultimately lead to the establishment of Manchu rule over Mongolia.&lt;ref name="patterson 89" /&gt; In this meeting with the Qing emperor, Goldstein asserts that the Dalai Lama was not someone to be trifled with due to his alliance with Mongol tribes, some of which were declared enemies of the Qing.&lt;ref name="goldstein 10"&gt;Goldstein, ''The Snow Lion and the Dragon'', 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Van Praag states that Tibet and the Dalai Lama's power was recognized by the "Manchu Emperor, the Mongolian Khans and Princes, and the rulers of [[Ladakh]], Nepal, [[India]], [[Bhutan]], and [[Sikkim]]."&lt;ref name="van praag 11" /&gt;

When the [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] Mongols attempted to spread their territory from what is now [[Xinjiang]] into Tibet, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] (r.&amp;nbsp;1661–1722) responded to Tibetan pleas for aid with [[Chinese expedition to Tibet (1720)|his own expedition to Tibet]], occupying Lhasa in 1720.&lt;ref name="ebrey 227"&gt;Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 227.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kolb 368"&gt;Albert Kolb, ''East Asia: China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam: Geography of a Cultural Region'', trans. C.A.M. Sym (New York: Routledge, 1971), 368.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1751, during the reign of the [[Qianlong Emperor]] (r.&amp;nbsp;1735–1796), a protectorate and permanent Qing dynasty garrison was established in Tibet.&lt;ref name="ebrey 227" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kolb 368" /&gt; As of 1751, Albert Kolb writes that "Chinese claims to suzerainty over Tibet date from this time."&lt;ref name="kolb 368" /&gt;

'''''The Occult Review''''' was a [[England|British]] illustrated monthly [[magazine]] published between 1905 and 1951 containing articles and correspondence by many notable occultists and authors of the day, including [[Aleister Crowley]], [[Meredith Starr]], [[Walter Leslie Wilmshurst]], [[Arthur Edward Waite]], [[Franz Hartmann]], [[Florence Farr]], and [[Paul Brunton]]. Edited by [[Ralph Shirley]] and published in London by William Rider and Son, LTD. (later [[Rider (imprint)|Rider &amp; Company]]), it is said to have been devoted to the investigation of supernormal phenomena and the study of psychological problems. It was published under different names from 1905 to 1951. From September 1933 to April 1938 it was published as ''The London Forum''. In January 1936 it semi-reverted to ''The Occult Review'' (incorporating the "London Forum") as a quarterly, but then reassumed its original title in its July 1938 issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://photos.bapho.net/OccultReviews/ Occult reviews]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2423">[[Image:LotAndAberham.jpg|thumb|''The Parting of Lot and Abraham'' mosaic from Santa Maria Maggiore]]

'''''The Parting of Lot and Abraham''''' is one in a series of [[mosaic]] scenes, probably dating to the 430s, that decorate the nave wall of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], one of the most prominent [[basilica]]n churches in [[Rome]].  The mosaic shows the story in the biblical [[Book of Genesis]] of the parting of [[Abraham]] from his nephew, [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]], as they choose opposing paths.  Abraham (on the left) with [[Isaac]] and the rest of his family, chooses the road to [[Canaan]], 
as God intends him to, and Lot chooses to take his followers to [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Fred S. Gardner's Art Through the Ages : A Global History. 13th ed. Belmont: Wadsworth, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is a [[tessera]] mosaic, tessera describing the material making up the surface of the work. Most tessera works during this time would be made up of small pieces of limestone or marble, cut to shape, and arranged by the artist.&lt;ref&gt;"tessera." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 03 Feb. 2009 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/588629/tessera&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
The artist uses several conventions of the time.  The grouping of the characters is varied,  meant to create the illusion of space. This "shorthand" way of depicting a crowd is sometimes called a "head cluster".  There is a hieratic abandonment of consistent and realistic proportions and scale, allowing the artist to put emphasis on the characters of his choosing using attributes like size. The main characters we are intended to focus on are made extremely clear through this method, and the picture itself becomes less illustrative and more symbolic. Eventually this style comes to a refined maturity during the Middle Ages. The move towards completely two-dimensional representative images has already started, and although this mosaic implements the use of lights and darks, with shadows corresponding to the figures, there is a good indication as to what direction religious art is heading.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Fred S. Gardner's Art Through the Ages : A Global History. 13th ed. Belmont: Wadsworth, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

He said, "We used to read in our papers the slogan of Zionism, ‘to give back a people to a Land without a People,' while the truth was that Palestine was already well-peopled with a population which was rapidly increasing from natural causes."&lt;ref&gt;Muir, Diana.

{{nihongo|'''Yoshida Kanetomo'''|吉田兼倶|1435–1511}} was a [[Japan]]ese [[Shinto]] priest of the [[Sengoku period]]. He was a seminal figure in the evolution of a coherent descriptive and interpretive [[Model (abstract)|schema]] of Shinto ritual and [[mythology]].&lt;ref name="ito"&gt;Itō Satoshi. [http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=585  "Yoshida Kanetomo,"] ''Encyclopedia of Shinto.'' April 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Kanetomo progressed gradually through the ranks of the Imperial offices in the [[Jingi-kan]] (Department of Shinto Affairs), which was one of the Imperial bureaucracies which were set up under the  [[ritsuryō]] system in the 8th century.  Kanetomo's eventually became an {{nihongo|Imperial Chamberlain|侍従|jijū}}.  Other positions he held at different times were {{nihongo|Senior Assistant Director of Divinities|神祇大輔|jingi taifu}} and {{nihongo|Vice Director of the Board of Censors|弾正台弼|danjōdai hitsu}}.&lt;ref name="ito"/&gt;

*'''1511''' (''[[Eishō (Muromachi period)|Eishō]] 8, 2nd month''): When Kanetomo died at the age of 77, his passing was considered a significant event in the chronicles of the Imperial [[history of Japan]].&lt;ref name="titsingh368"&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834) {{Google books|18oNAAAAIAAJ|''Annales des empereurs du japon,'' p. 368.|page=368}}; aka Ourabe no Kane tomo&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yoshida Shinto==
The early period Shinto school founded by Kanetomo was called ''Genpon-Sōgen Shinto'' ("Shinto of the Original Founder"),&lt;ref name="ito"/&gt; also known as Yuiitsu Shintō ("Only one Shintō").&lt;ref&gt;Scheid, Bernhard. (2001). ''Der eine und einzige Weg der Götter: Yoshida Kanetomo und die Erfindung des Shinto,'' p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to Kanetomo, the understanding and practice of Shinto was intermingled with Buddhism.&lt;ref name="titsingh368"/&gt;  Sanetomo invested a lifetime in a process of disentangling what were thereafter construed as the two distinct entities.&lt;ref name="ito"/&gt;

===Inverted ''honji suijaku''===
{{Main|Honji suijaku}}
The term ''[[honji suijaku]]'' expresses a Japanese [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] theory according to which a perceived Shinto ''[[kami]]'' is the manifestation of a Buddhist god.&lt;ref&gt;Satō Masato. [http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1356   "''Honji Suijaku Setsu'',"] ''Encyclopedia of Shinto.'' March 30, 2007; ''Basic Terms of Shinto'', [http://www2.kokugakuin.ac.jp/ijcc/wp/bts/bts_h.html#honji-suijaku_setsu   "Honji Suijaku Setsu,"] 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  This theory proposed and presumed that the resulting dual entity would necessarily have a fundamental Buddhist core, and that any Shinto aspect was secondary.&lt;ref&gt;Scheid, Bernhard. [http://www.univie.ac.at/rel_jap/gesch/honjisuijaku.htm  "''Honji suijaku: Die Angleichung von Buddhas und Kami'';"] Breen, John and Mark Teuween. (2000). {{Google books|MADlfH002mAC|''Shinto in History: Ways of the Kami,'' p. 95.|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late [[Kamakura period]], a counter-theory arose which also began with the notion of such dual entities; however, the counter-theorists construed that the ''kami'' side was primary and the Buddhist one was secondary.  This came to be known as the ''Inverted honji suijaku ''.&lt;ref&gt;Breen, John and Mark Teuween. (2000). {{Google books|MADlfH002mAC|''Shinto in History: Ways of the Kami,'' p. 95.|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanetomo was influenced by these ideas and brought them further. He proposed to set aside the conceptual theories of such entities.&lt;ref&gt;Shirayama, Yoshitarō. [http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1355  "''Han-Honji Suijaku Setsu'' ('Anti-Honjisuijaku thought')."] ''Encyclopedia of Shinto.'' March 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Up through the end of the [[Edo]] period, Kanetomo's followers and the [[Yoshida Shrine]] were granted the right to award ranks to all shrines and priests except for those associated with the Imperial family.&lt;ref&gt;Breen, John et al. (2000). {{Google books|MADlfH002mAC|''Shinto in History: Ways of the Kami,'' p. 176.|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*There is no escaping karma. In a previous life, you never called, you never wrote, you never visited. And whose fault was that?
*To know the Buddha is the highest attainment. Second highest is to go to the same doctor as the Buddha.
