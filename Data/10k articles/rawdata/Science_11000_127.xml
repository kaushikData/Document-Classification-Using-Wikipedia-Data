'''Action model learning''' (sometimes abbreviated '''action learning''') is an area of [[machine learning]] concerned with creation and modification of [[software agent]]'s knowledge about ''effects'' and ''preconditions'' of the ''actions'' that can be executed within its ''environment''. This knowledge is usually represented in logic-based [[action language|action description language]] and used as the input for [[automated planning|automated planners]].

Learning action models is important when goals change. When an agent acted for a while, it can use its accumulated knowledge about actions in the domain to make better decisions. Thus, learning action models differs from [[reinforcement learning]]. It enables reasoning about actions instead of expensive trials in the world.&lt;ref name="amir2008"&gt;
{{cite journal
  | last = Amir | first = Eyal
  | last2 = Chang | first2 = Allen
  | title = Learning Partially Observable Deterministic Action Models
  | journal = Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR)
  | volume = 33
  | pages = 349&amp;ndash;402
  | year = 2008
  | url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1622708
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Action model learning is a form of [[inductive reasoning]], where new knowledge is generated based on agent's ''observations''. It differs from standard [[supervised learning]] in that correct input/output pairs are never presented, nor imprecise action models explicitly corrected.

Usual motivation for action model learning is the fact that manual specification of action models for planners is often a difficult, time consuming, and error-prone task (especially in complex environments).

== Action models ==

Given a [[training set]] &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; consisting of examples &lt;math&gt;e = (s,a,s')&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;s,s'&lt;/math&gt; are observations of a world state from two consecutive time steps &lt;math&gt;t, t'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is an ''action instance'' observed in time step &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the goal of action model learning in general is to construct an ''action model'' &lt;math&gt;\langle D,P \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is a description of domain dynamics in action description formalism like [[STRIPS]], [[Architecture description language|ADL]] or [[PDDL]] and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a probability function defined over the elements of &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;.

However, many state of the art ''action learning methods'' assume determinism and do not induce &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. In addition to determinism, individual methods differ in how they deal with other attributes of domain (e.g. partial observability or sensoric noise).

== Action learning methods ==

=== State of the art ===
Recent action learning methods take various approaches and employ a wide variety of tools from different areas of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computational logic]]. As an example of a method based on propositional logic, we can mention SLAF (Simultaneous Learning and Filtering) algorithm,&lt;ref name="amir2008"/&gt; which uses agent's observations to construct a long propositional formula over time and subsequently interprets it using a [[SAT solver|satisfiability (SAT) solver]]. Another technique, in which learning is converted into a satisfiability problem (weighted [[MAX-SAT]] in this case) and SAT solvers are used, is implemented in ARMS (Action-Relation Modeling System).&lt;ref name="yang2007"&gt;
{{cite journal
|last1=Yang
|first1=Qiang
|last2=Kangheng
|first2=Wu
|last3=Yunfei
|first3=Jiang
|title=Learning action models from plan examples using weighted MAX-SAT
|journal=Artificial Intelligence
|date=2007
|volume=171
|pages=107–143
|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370206001408
|doi=10.1016/j.artint.2006.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two mutually similar, fully declarative approaches to action learning were based on logic programming paradigm [[Answer Set Programming]] (ASP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Balduccini|first1=Marcelo|title=Learning Action Descriptions with A-Prolog: Action Language C|journal=AAAI Spring Symposium: Logical Formalizations of Commonsense Reasoning|date=2007|pages=13–18|url=http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Spring/2007/ss07-05-004.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its extension, Reactive ASP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Čertický|first1=Michal|title=Action Learning with Reactive Answer Set Programming: Preliminary Report|journal=ICAS 2012, The Eighth International Conference on Autonomic and Autonomous Systems|date=2012|pages=107–111|url=http://www.thinkmind.org/index.php?view=article&amp;articleid=icas_2012_5_20_20056}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another example, bottom-up [[inductive logic programming]] approach was employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benson|first1=Scott|title=Inductive learning of reactive action models|journal=Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Twelfth International Conference (ICML)|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several different solutions are not directly logic-based. For example, the action model learning using a [[perceptron algorithm]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mourao|first1=Kira|last2=Petrick|first2=Ronald|last3=Steedman|first3=Mark|title=Learning action effects in partially observable domains|journal=European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI)|date=2010|volume=215|pages=973–974|doi=10.3233/978-1-60750-606-5-973|url=http://www.ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/5920}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the multi level [[greedy search]] over the space of
possible action models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zettlemoyer|first1=Luke|last2=Pasula|first2=Hanna|last3=Kaelblin|first3=Leslie Pack|title=Learning planning rules in noisy stochastic worlds|journal=AAAI|date=2005|pages=911–918|url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.65.3417}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the older paper from 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lin|first1=Long-Ji|title=Self-improving reactive agents based on reinforcement learning, planning and teaching|journal=Machine Learning|date=1992|volume=8|issue=3-4|pages=293–321|doi=10.1023/A:1022628806385|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1022628806385}}&lt;/ref&gt; the action model learning was studied as an extension of [[reinforcement learning]].

=== Literature ===
Most action learning research papers are published in journals and conferences focused on [[artificial intelligence]] in general (e.g. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR), Artificial Intelligence, Applied Artificial Intelligence (AAI) or AAAI conferences). Despite mutual relevance of the topics, action model learning is usually not addressed on [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]] conferences like ICAPS.

He was born in 1849 in [[Kishinyov]] in the [[Russian Empire]], now in [[Moldavia]]. After graduating from the [[Saint Petersburg Polytechnical Institute]], he continued his education in [[Paris]], where he studied chemistry.

Returning to Russia, Loran became a teacher in a school in [[Baku]], which was the main center of the Russian [[oil industry]] at that time. Impressed by the terrible and hardly extinguishable oil fires that he had seen there, Loran tried to find such a liquid substance that could deal effectively with the problem.  So he invented [[fire fighting foam]], which was successfully tested in several experiments in 1902-1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://p-lab.org/publ/7-1-0-15 Loran and the fire extinguisher] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727161356/http://p-lab.org/publ/7-1-0-15 |date=2011-07-27 }} at p-lab.org {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904 Loran patented his invention, and developed the first [[Fire extinguisher#Foams|foam extinguisher]] the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://terra-incognita.at.ua/news/2009-03-19-14 The history of fire extinguisher] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, he founded a company called ''Eurica'', based in Saint Petersburg, and started to sell his fire extinguishers under that brand.

The book '''''An Essay on the Principle of Population''''' was first published anonymously in 1798,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=|first= |author-link=|year=1798 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title= An Essay on the Principle of Population As It Affects the Future Improvement of Society, with Remarks on the Speculations of Mr. Goodwin, M.

The book predicted a grim future, as population would increase geometrically, doubling every 25 years,&lt;ref name="BRIA"&gt;{{cite book |title= BRIA 26 2 The Debate Over World Population: Was Malthus Right? |chapter= Malthus’ Principle of Population |volume=26 |issue=2 |date= Winter 2010 |agency= Constitutional Rights Foundation (CRF) |url= http://www.crf-usa.org/bill-of-rights-in-action/bria-26-2-the-debate-over-world-population-was-malthus-right.html |access-date= 2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but food production would only grow arithmetically, which would result in famine and starvation, unless births were controlled.&lt;ref name=BRIA/&gt; 

While it was not the first book on population, it was revised for over 28 years and has been acknowledged as the most influential work of its era. Malthus's book fuelled debate about the size of the population in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and contributed to the passing of the [[Census Act 1800]]. This Act enabled the holding of a [[census in the United Kingdom|national census]] in England, Wales and Scotland, starting in 1801 and continuing every ten years to the present. The book's 6th edition (1826) was independently cited as a key influence by both [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] in developing the theory of [[natural selection]].

A key portion of the book was dedicated to what is now known as Malthus' '''Iron Law of Population'''.  This name itself is retrospective, based on the [[iron law of wages]], which is the reformulation of Malthus' position by [[Ferdinand Lassalle]], who in turn derived the name from [[Goethe]]'s "great, eternal iron laws" in ''[[Das Göttliche]].''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Critique of the Gotha Programme]],'' [[Karl Marx]], [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch02.htm Chapter 2], [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch02.htm#1 footnote 1], (1875)&lt;/ref&gt; This theory suggested that growing population rates would contribute to a rising supply of labour that would inevitably lower wages. In essence, Malthus feared that continued population growth would lend itself to poverty and famine.

In 1803, Malthus published, under the same title, a heavily revised second edition of his work.&lt;ref&gt;The fourth edition appeared in 1807 in two volumes. See {{Citation |last=Malthus |first=Thomas Robert |author-link=Thomas Robert Malthus |title= An Essay on the Principle of Population, or a View of Its Past and Present Effects on Human Happiness, with An Enquiry into Our Prospects Respecting the Future Removal or Mitigation of the Evils Which It Occasions |volume=I |edition=Fourth |publisher= J. Johnson |date=1807 |place=London |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TT4uAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AyBM6trQ-zfsC&amp;pg=PR3 }}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0T4uAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AyBM6trQ-zfsC&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false volume II] via Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; His final version, the 6th edition, was published in 1826. In 1830, 32 years after the first edition, Malthus published a condensed version entitled ''A Summary View on the Principle of Population'', which included responses to criticisms of the larger work.

== Overview ==
Between 1798 and 1826 Malthus published six editions of his famous treatise, updating each edition to incorporate new material, to address criticism, and to convey changes in his own perspectives on the subject. He wrote the original text in reaction to the optimism of his father and his father's associates (notably Rousseau) regarding the future improvement of society. Malthus also constructed his case as a specific response to writings of [[William Godwin]] (1756–1836) and of the [[Marquis de Condorcet]] (1743–1794).

[[File:Malthus 1826 vol 1 page 435 top Table England Population Growth 1780-1810.jpg|thumb|Part of [[Thomas Malthus]]'s table of [[population growth]] in England 1780-1810, from his ''An Essay on the Principle of Population'', 6th edition, 1826]]

Malthus regarded ideals of future improvement in the lot of humanity with scepticism, considering that throughout history a segment of every human population seemed relegated to poverty. He explained this phenomenon by arguing that population growth generally expanded in times and in regions of plenty until the size of the population relative to the primary resources caused distress:
{{quote|"Yet in all societies, even those that are most vicious, the tendency to a virtuous attachment [i.e., marriage] is so strong, that there is a constant effort towards an increase of population. This constant effort as constantly tends to subject the lower classes of the society to distress and to prevent any great permanent amelioration of their condition".|Malthus T.R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population.'' Chapter II.&lt;ref name=quote1&gt;p. 18 in [[Oxford World's Classics]] reprint; p. 29 in [[s:An Essay on the Principle of Population/Chapter II|the original text]] in [[Image:wikisource-logo.svg|16x16px]] [[Wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|The way in which these effects are produced seems to be this. We will suppose the means of subsistence in any country just equal to the easy support of its inhabitants. The constant effort towards population... increases the number of people before the means of subsistence are increased. The food therefore which before supported seven millions must now be divided among seven millions and a half or eight millions. The poor consequently must live much worse, and many of them be reduced to severe distress. The number of labourers also being above the proportion of the work in the market, the price of labour must tend toward a decrease, while the price of provisions would at the same time tend to rise. The labourer therefore must work harder to earn the same as he did before. During this season of distress, the discouragements to marriage, and the difficulty of rearing a family are so great that population is at a stand. In the mean time the cheapness of labour, the plenty of labourers, and the necessity of an increased industry amongst them, encourage cultivators to employ more labour upon their land, to turn up fresh soil, and to manure and improve more completely what is already in tillage, till ultimately the means of subsistence become in the same proportion to the population as at the period from which we set out. The situation of the labourer being then again tolerably comfortable, the restraints to population are in some degree loosened, and the same retrograde and progressive movements with respect to happiness are repeated.|Malthus T.R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population''. Chapter II, p 19 in Oxford World's Classics reprint.}}

Malthus also saw that societies through history had experienced at one time or another epidemics, famines, or wars: events that masked the fundamental problem of populations overstretching their resource limitations:

{{quote|The power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man, that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race. The vices of mankind are active and able ministers of depopulation. They are the precursors in the great army of destruction, and often finish the dreadful work themselves. But should they fail in this war of extermination, sickly seasons, epidemics, pestilence, and plague advance in terrific array, and sweep off their thousands and tens of thousands. Should success be still incomplete, gigantic inevitable famine stalks in the rear, and with one mighty blow levels the population with the food of the world.|Malthus T.R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population''. Chapter VII, p 44&lt;ref name="Oxford World's Classics reprint"&gt;Oxford World's Classics reprint&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rapid increase in the global population of the past century exemplifies Malthus's predicted population patterns; it also appears to describe socio-demographic dynamics of complex [[pre-industrial society|pre-industrial societies]]. These findings are the basis for neo-Malthusian modern mathematical models of ''long-term historical dynamics''.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Peter Turchin]] 2003; [http://cliodynamics.info/PDF/Turchin_Korotayev_SEH_2006.pdf Turchin and Korotayev 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229202712/http://cliodynamics.info/PDF/Turchin_Korotayev_SEH_2006.pdf |date=February 29, 2012 }}; Peter Turchin et al. 2007; [[Korotayev]] et al. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malthus made the specific prediction that world population would fall below a line going upward from its then current population of one billion, adding one billion every 25 years. He wrote:
{{quote|If the subsistence for man that the earth affords was to be increased every twenty-five years by a quantity equal to what the whole world at present produces, this would allow the power of production in the earth to be absolutely unlimited, and its ratio of increase much greater than we can conceive that any possible exertions of mankind could make it....yet still the power of population being a power of a superior order, the increase of the human species can only be kept commensurate to the increase of the means of subsistence by the constant operation of the strong law of necessity acting as a check upon the greater power.|Malthus T.R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population''. Chapter 2, p 8&lt;ref name="Oxford World's Classics reprint"&gt;Oxford World's Classics reprint&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;!--This prediction is illustrated in the chart on the right. The chart also illustrates the current UN data on world population since 1800, and UN projections for future growth. (someone seems to have removed the relevant chart)--&gt;To date, world population has remained below his predicted line. However, the current rate of increase since 1955 is over two billion per 25 years, more than twice the Malthus predicted maximum rate. At the same time, world [[hunger]] has been in decline. The highest UN projection has population continuing at this rate and surpassing the Malthus predicted line. This high projection supposes today's growth rate is sustainable to the year 2100 and beyond.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

=== Proposed solutions ===
Malthus argued that two types of checks hold population within resource limits: ''positive'' checks, which raise the death rate; and ''preventive'' ones, which lower the birth rate. The positive checks include hunger, disease and war; the preventive checks,  birth control,  postponement of marriage, and celibacy.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Gilbert, introduction to Malthus T.R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population''. Oxford World's Classics reprint. viii&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding possibilities for freeing man from these limits, Malthus argued against a variety of imaginable solutions. For example, he satirically criticized the notion that agricultural improvements could expand without limit:

{{quote|"If the progress were really unlimited it might be increased ad infinitum, but this is so gross an absurdity that we may be quite sure that among plants, as well as among animals, there is a limit to improvement, though we do not exactly know where it is. It is probable that the gardeners who contend for flower prizes have often applied stronger dressing without success. At the same time, it would be highly presumptuous in any man to say, that he had seen the finest carnation or anemone that could ever be made to grow. He might however assert without the smallest chance of being contradicted by a future fact, that no carnation or anemone could ever by cultivation be increased to the size of a large cabbage; and yet there are assignable quantities much greater than a cabbage. No man can say that he has seen the largest ear of wheat, or the largest oak that could ever grow; but he might easily, and with perfect certainty, name a point of magnitude, at which they would not arrive. In all these cases therefore, a careful distinction should be made, between an unlimited progress, and a progress where the limit is merely undefined."}}

He also commented on the notion that [[Francis Galton]] later called [[eugenics]]:

{{quote|"It does not... by any means seem impossible that by an attention to breed, a certain degree of improvement, similar to that among animals, might take place among men. Whether intellect could be communicated may be a matter of doubt; but size, strength, beauty, complexion, and perhaps longevity are in a degree transmissible... As the human race, however, could not be improved in this way without condemning all the bad specimens to celibacy, it is not probable that an attention to breed should ever become general".|Malthus T.R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population''. Chapter IX, p 72&lt;ref name="Oxford World's Classics reprint"/&gt;}}

In the second and subsequent editions Malthus put more emphasis on ''moral restraint''. By that he meant the postponement of marriage until people could support a family, coupled with strict [[celibacy]] ([[sexual abstinence]]) until that time.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}} "He went so far as to claim that moral restraint on a wide scale was the best means—indeed, the only means—of easing the poverty of the lower classes."&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Gilbert, introduction to Malthus T.R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population''. Oxford World's Classics reprint. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; This plan appeared consistent with virtue, economic gain and social improvement.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Malthus emphasises the difference between government-supported welfare, and public charity. He proposed the gradual abolition of [[poor laws]] by gradually reducing the number of persons qualifying for relief. Relief in dire distress would come from private charity.&lt;ref&gt;Malthus T.R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population''. Chapter V, pp&amp;nbsp;39–45, in Oxford World's Classics reprint.&lt;/ref&gt; He reasoned that poor relief acted against the longer-term interests of the poor by raising the price of commodities and undermining the independence and resilience of the peasant.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In other words, the poor laws tended to "create the poor which they maintain."&lt;ref&gt;By doing what appears good, we may do harm. Unintended consequences play a major role in economic thought; see the [[invisible hand]] and the [[tragedy of the commons]].&lt;/ref&gt;

It offended Malthus that critics claimed he lacked a caring attitude toward the situation of the poor. In the 1798 edition his concern for the poor shows in passages such as the following:

{{quote|Nothing is so common as to hear of encouragements that ought to be given to population. If the tendency of mankind to increase be so great as I have represented it to be, it may appear strange that this increase does not come when it is thus repeatedly called for. The true reason is, that the demand for a greater population is made without preparing the funds necessary to support it. Increase the demand for agricultural labour by promoting cultivation, and with it consequently increase the produce of the country, and ameliorate the condition of the labourer, and no apprehensions whatever need be entertained of the proportional increase of population. An attempt to effect this purpose in any other way is vicious, cruel, and tyrannical, and in any state of tolerable freedom cannot therefore succeed.}}

In an addition to the 1817 edition he wrote:

{{quote|I have written a chapter expressly on the practical direction of our charity; and in detached passages elsewhere have paid a just tribute to the exalted virtue of benevolence. To those who have read these parts of my work, and have attended to the general tone and spirit of the whole, I willingly appeal, if they are but tolerably candid, against these charges ... which intimate that I would root out the virtues of charity and benevolence without regard to the exaltation which they bestow on the moral dignity of our nature...&lt;ref&gt;p607, cited in http://www.naf.org.au/roberts.rtf.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some, such as [[William Farr]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eyler|first=John M|title=Victorian Social Medicine: the ideas and methods of William Farr|year=1979|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-2246-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[Karl Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Ronald L. Meek|editor=R. L. Meek|title=Marx and Engels on Malthus|year=1953|publisher=Lawrence &amp; Wishart|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that Malthus did not fully recognize the human capacity to increase food supply. On this subject, however, Malthus had written: "The main peculiarity which distinguishes man from other animals, in the means of his support, is the power which he possesses of very greatly increasing these means."&lt;ref&gt;

=== On religion ===
As a Christian and a clergyman, Malthus addressed the question of how an omnipotent and caring God could permit suffering. In the First Edition of his Essay (1798) Malthus reasoned that the constant threat of poverty and starvation served to teach the virtues of hard work and virtuous behaviour.&lt;ref name=bowler&gt;{{cite book|author=Bowler, Peter J.|title=Evolution: the history of an idea|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|year=2003|pages=104–105|isbn=0-520-23693-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt; "Had population and food increased in the same ratio, it is probable that man might never have emerged from the savage state,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malthus|first=Thomas|title=Population: The First Essay|year=1959|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-06031-3|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote, adding further, "Evil exists in the world not to create despair, but activity."&lt;ref&gt;Malthus T.R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population''. Oxford World's Classics reprint. p 158 Similarly, Malthus believed that "the infinite variety of nature...is admirably adapted to further the high purpose of the creation and to produce the greatest possible quantity of good." Malthus, ''An Essay on the Principle of Population'', 1st ed., published anonymously, (St. Paul's Churchyard, London: J. Johnson, 1798), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, although the threat of poverty could be understood to be a prod to motivate human industry, it was not God's will that man should suffer. Malthus wrote that mankind itself was solely to blame for human suffering: {{quote|"I believe that it is the intention of the Creator that the earth should be replenished; but certainly with a healthy, virtuous and happy population, not an unhealthy, vicious and miserable one. And if, in endeavouring to obey the command to increase and multiply,&lt;ref&gt;Genesis I:28&lt;/ref&gt; we people it only with beings of this latter description and suffer accordingly, we have no right to impeach the justice of the command, but our irrational mode of executing it."&lt;ref&gt;Malthus T.R. 1826. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population, Sixth Edition'', App.I.6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Demographics, wages, and inflation ===
Malthus wrote of the relationship between population, real wages, and inflation. When the population of laborers grows faster than the production of food, real wages fall because the growing population causes the [[cost of living]] (i.e., the cost of food) to go up. Difficulties of raising a family eventually reduce the rate of population growth, until the falling population again leads to higher real wages:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A circumstance which has, perhaps, more than any other, contributed to conceal this oscillation from common view, is the difference between the nominal and real price of labour. It very rarely happens that the nominal price of labour universally falls; but we well know that it frequently remains the same, while the nominal price of provisions has been gradually rising. This, indeed, will generally be the case, if the increase of manufactures and commerce be sufficient to employ the new labourers that are thrown into the market, and to prevent the increased supply from lowering the money-price. But an increased number of labourers receiving the same money-wages will necessarily, by their competition, increase the money-price of corn. This is, in fact, a real fall in the price of labour; and, during this period, the condition of the lower classes of the community must be gradually growing worse. But the farmers and capitalists are growing rich from the real cheapness of labour. Their increasing capitals enable them to employ a greater number of men; and, as the population had probably suffered some check from the greater difficulty of supporting a family, the demand for labour, after a certain period, would be great in proportion to the supply, and its price would of course rise, if left to find its natural level; and thus the wages of labour, and consequently the condition of the lower classes of society, might have progressive and retrograde movements, though the price of labour might never nominally fall.&lt;ref&gt;Essay (1798), Chap. IV. Accessed from http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/1945 on 2010-02-13&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In later editions of his essay, Malthus clarified his view that if society relied on human misery to limit population growth, then sources of misery (e.g., hunger, disease, and war, termed by Malthus "positive checks on population") would inevitably afflict society, as would volatile economic cycles. On the other hand, "preventive checks" to population that limited birthrates, such as later marriages, could ensure a higher standard of living for all, while also increasing economic stability.&lt;ref&gt;Essay (1826), I:2.

== 1st edition ==
The full title of the first edition of Malthus' essay was ''"An Essay on the Principle of Population, as it affects the Future Improvement of Society with remarks on the Speculations of [[William Godwin|Mr. Godwin]], [[Marquis de Condorcet|M. Condorcet]], and Other Writers."''  The speculations and other writers are explained below.

[[William Godwin]] had published his [[utopian]] work ''Enquiry concerning Political Justice'' in 1793, with later editions in 1796 and 1798. Also, ''Of Avarice and Profusion'' (1797). Malthus' remarks on Godwin's work spans chapters 10 through 15 (inclusive) out of nineteen. Godwin responded with ''Of Population'' (1820).

The [[Marquis de Condorcet]] had published his utopian vision of social progress and the perfectibility of man ''Esquisse d'un Tableau Historique des Progres de l'Espirit Humain (The Future Progress of the Human Mind)'' in 1794. Malthus' remarks on Condorcet's work spans chapters 8 and 9.

Malthus' essay was in response to these utopian visions, as he argued:
{{quote|This natural inequality of the two powers, of population, and of production of the earth, and that great law of our nature which must constantly keep their effects equal, form the great difficulty that appears to me insurmountable in the way to the perfectibility of society.}}

The "other writers" included Robert Wallace, [[Adam Smith]], [[Richard Price]], and [[David Hume]].

Malthus himself claimed:
{{quote|The only authors from whose writings I had deduced the principle, which formed the main argument of the Essay, were Hume, Wallace, Adam Smith, and Dr. Price...}}

Chapters 1 and 2 outline Malthus' Principle of Population, and the unequal nature of food supply to population growth. The [[exponential growth|exponential]] nature of population growth is today known as the [[Malthusian growth model]]. This aspect of Malthus' Principle of Population, together with his assertion that food supply was subject to a [[linear]] growth model, would remain unchanged in future editions of his essay. Note that Malthus actually used the terms [[geometric progression|geometric]] and [[arithmetic progression|arithmetic]], respectively.

Chapter 3 examines the overrun of the Roman empire by barbarians, due to population pressure. War as a check on population is examined.

Chapter 4 examines the current state of populousness of civilized nations (particularly Europe). Malthus criticises [[David Hume]] for a "probable error" in his "criteria that he proposes as assisting in an estimate of population."

Chapter 5 examines The Poor Laws of [[Pitt the Younger]] .

Chapter 6 examines the rapid growth of new colonies such as the former [[Thirteen Colonies]] of the [[United States of America]].

Chapter 7 examines checks on population such as [[Infectious disease|pestilence]] and [[famine]].

Chapter 8 also examines a "probable error" by Wallace "that the difficulty arising from population is at a great distance."

Chapters 16 and 17 examine the causes of the wealth of states, including criticisms of [[Adam Smith]] and [[Richard Price]]. English wealth is compared with Chinese poverty.

Chapters 18 and 19 set out a [[theodicy]] to explain the [[problem of evil]] in terms of [[natural theology]]. This views the world as "a mighty process for awakening matter" in which the Supreme Being acting "according to general laws" created "wants of the body" as "necessary to create exertion" which forms "the reasoning faculty". In this way, the principle of population would "tend rather to promote, than impede the general purpose of Providence."

The 1st edition influenced writers of natural theology such as [[William Paley]] and [[Thomas Chalmers]].

== 2nd to 6th editions ==
Following both widespread praise and criticism of his essay, Malthus revised his arguments and recognized other influences:{{cn|date=April 2018}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the course of this enquiry I found that much more had been done than I had been aware of, when I first published the Essay. The poverty and misery arising from a too rapid increase of population had been distinctly seen, and the most violent remedies proposed, so long ago as the times of Plato and Aristotle. And of late years the subject has been treated in such a manner by some of the French Economists; occasionally by Montesquieu, and, among our own writers, by Dr. Franklin, Sir James Stewart, Mr. Arthur Young, and Mr. Townsend, as to create a natural surprise that it had not excited more of the public attention.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 2nd edition, published in 1803 (with Malthus now clearly identified as the author), was entitled "''An Essay on the Principle of Population; or, a View of its Past and Present Effects on Human Happiness; with an enquiry into our Prospects respecting the Future Removal or Mitigation of the Evils which it occasions''."

Malthus advised that the 2nd edition "may be considered as a new work",{{cn|date=April 2018}} and the subsequent editions were all minor revisions of the 2nd edition. These were published in 1806, 1807, 1817, and 1826.

By far the biggest change was in how the 2nd to 6th editions of the essay were structured, and the most copious and detailed [[evidence]] that Malthus presented, more than any previous such book on population. Essentially, for the first time, Malthus examined his own Principle of Population on a region-by-region basis of [[world population]]. The essay was organized in four books:

* Book I – Of the Checks to Population in the Less Civilized Parts of the World and in Past Times. 
* Book II – Of the Checks To Population in the Different States of Modern Europe. 
* Book III – Of the different Systems or Expedients which have been proposed or have prevailed in Society, as They affect the Evils arising from the Principle of Population. 
* Book IV – Of our future Prospects respecting the Removal or Mitigation of the Evils arising from the Principle of Population.

Due in part to the highly influential nature of Malthus' work (see main article [[Thomas Malthus]]), this approach is regarded as pivotal in establishing the field of [[demography]].

The following controversial quote appears in the second edition:{{cn|date=April 2018}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;A man who is born into a world already possessed, if he cannot get subsistence from his parents on whom he has a just demand, and if the society do not want his labour, has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food, and, in fact, has no business to be where he is. At nature's mighty feast there is no vacant cover for him. She tells him to be gone, and will quickly execute her own orders, if he does not work upon the compassion of some of her guests. If these guests get up and make room for him, other intruders immediately appear demanding the same favour. The report of a provision for all that come, fills the hall with numerous claimants. The order and harmony of the feast is disturbed, the plenty that before reigned is changed into scarcity; and the happiness of the guests is destroyed by the spectacle of misery and dependence in every part of the hall, and by the clamorous importunity of those, who are justly enraged at not finding the provision which they had been taught to expect. The guests learn too late their error, in counter-acting those strict orders to all intruders, issued by the great mistress of the feast, who, wishing that all guests should have plenty, and knowing she could not provide for unlimited numbers, humanely refused to admit fresh comers when her table was already full.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ecologist Professor [[Garrett Hardin]] claims that the preceding passage inspired hostile reactions from many critics. The offending passage of Malthus' essay appeared in the 2nd edition only, as Malthus felt obliged to remove it.&lt;ref name="Feast of Malthus"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 2nd edition onwards – in Book IV – Malthus advocated moral restraint as an additional, and voluntary, check on population. This included such measures as [[sexual abstinence]] and late marriage.

As noted by Professor Robert M. Young, Malthus dropped his chapters on [[natural theology]] from the 2nd edition onwards. Also, the essay became less of a personal response to [[William Godwin|Godwin]] and [[Marquis de Condorcet|Condorcet]].

== ''A Summary View'' ==
''A Summary View on the Principle of Population'' was published in 1830. The author was identified as Rev. T.R. Malthus, A.M., [[Fellow of the Royal Society|F.R.S.]] Malthus wrote ''A Summary View'' for those who did not have the leisure to read the full essay and, as he put it, "to correct some of the misrepresentations which have gone abroad respecting two or three of the most important points of the Essay".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Robert Malthus, George Thomas Bettany, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BcNEZlXh-esC&amp;pg=PA545 "A Summary View on the Principle of Population, p 36"]&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Summary View'' ends with a defense of the Principle of Population against the charge that it "impeaches the goodness of the Deity, and is inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the scriptures".

See main article [[Thomas Malthus]] for more.

This was Malthus' final word on his ''Principle of Population''. He died in 1834.

== Reception and influence of the ''Essay'' ==

=== Personalia ===
Malthus became subject to extreme personal criticism. People who knew nothing about his private life criticised him both for having no children and for having too many. In 1819, [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], berating Malthus as a priest, called him "a eunuch and a tyrant".&lt;ref&gt;Percy B. Shelley: "A philosophical view of reform." In ''The Complete Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley''. London: Gordian, 1829. (vol. 7, p. 32)&lt;/ref&gt; Marx repeated the idea, adding that Malthus had taken the vow of celibacy, and called him "superficial", "a professional plagiarist", "the agent of the landed aristocracy", "a paid advocate" and "the principal enemy of the people".&lt;ref&gt;
Dupaquier J. (ed). 1983. ''Malthus past and present''. New York: Academic Press. p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century an editor of the ''Everyman'' edition of Malthus claimed that Malthus had practised population control by begetting eleven girls.&lt;ref&gt;Fogarty, Michael P. 1958. Introduction to Malthus, ''Essay on the Principle of Population''. Dent, London. vi&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Malthus fathered two daughters and one son. [[Garrett Hardin]] provides an overview of such personal comments.&lt;ref name="Feast of Malthus" /&gt;

=== Early influence ===
The position held by Malthus as professor at the Haileybury training college, to his death in 1834, gave his theories some influence over [[British Empire in India|Britain's administration of India]].&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, William. 1979. ''Malthus''. Heinemann, London. 2nd ed 1999. p 32&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peterson, [[William Pitt the Younger]] (in office: 1783–1801 and 1804–1806), on reading the work of Malthus, withdrew a Bill he had introduced that called for the extension of [[Poor relief|Poor Relief]]. Concerns about Malthus's theory helped promote the idea of a national population [[census]] in the UK. Government official [[John Rickman]] became instrumental in the carrying out of the first modern British [[census]] in 1801, under Pitt's administration. In the 1830s Malthus's writings strongly influenced [[British Whig Party|Whig]] reforms which overturned [[Tory]] paternalism and brought in the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Law Amendment Act]] of 1834.

Malthus convinced most economists that even while high fertility might increase the [[gross output]], it tended to reduce output ''per capita''. David Ricardo and [[Alfred Marshall]] admired Malthus, and so came under his influence. Early converts to his population theory included [[William Paley]]. Despite Malthus's opposition to [[contraception]], his work exercised a strong influence on [[Francis Place]] (1771–1854), whose [[Neo-Malthusianism|neo-Malthusian]] movement became the first to advocate contraception. Place published his ''Illustrations and Proofs of the Principles of Population'' in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, William. 1979. ''Malthus''. Heinemann, London. 2nd ed 1999. Chapter 9: Fertility&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early responses in the Malthusian controversy ===
[[William Godwin]] criticized Malthus's criticisms of his own arguments in his book ''On Population'' (1820).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godwin|first=William|authorlink=William Godwin|title=Of Population: An Enquiry Concerning the Power of Increase in the Numbers of Mankind, Being an Answer to Mr. Malthus's Essay on That Subject|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7rc8AAAAcAAJ|accessdate=2010-03-29|year=1820|publisher=Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown|pages=648}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theoretical and political critiques of Malthus and Malthusian thinking emerged soon after the publication of the first ''Essay on Population'', most notably in the work of [[Robert Owen]], of the essayist [[William Hazlitt]] (1807)&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9QcAAAAAMAAJ A Reply to the Essay on Population, by the Rev. T. R. Malthus]''. For an annotated extract, see: [http://www.blupete.com/Literature/Essays/Hazlitt/MalthusReply.htm ''Malthus And The Liberties Of The Poor''], 1807&lt;/ref&gt; and of the economist [[Nassau William Senior]],&lt;ref&gt;''Two Lectures on Population'', 1829&lt;/ref&gt; and moralist [[William Cobbett]]. ''True Law of Population'' (1845) was by politician [[Thomas Doubleday]], an adherent of Cobbett's views.

John Stuart Mill strongly defended the ideas of Malthus in his 1848 work, ''Principles of Political Economy'' (Book II, Chapters 11–13). Mill considered the criticisms of Malthus made thus far to have been superficial.

The American economist [[Henry Charles Carey]] rejected Malthus's argument in his ''magnum opus'' of 1858–59, ''The Principles of Social Science''. Carey maintained that the only situation in which the means of subsistence will determine population growth is one in which a given society is not introducing new technologies or not adopting forward-thinking governmental policy, and that population regulated itself in every well-governed society, but its pressure on subsistence characterized the lower stages of civilization.

=== Marxist opposition ===
Another strand of opposition to Malthus's ideas started in the middle of the 19th century with the writings of [[Friedrich Engels]] (''Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy'', 1844) and [[Karl Marx]] (''Capital'', 1867). Engels and Marx argued that what Malthus saw as the problem of the pressure of population on the means of production actually represented the pressure of the means of production on population. They thus viewed it in terms of their concept of the [[reserve army of labour]]. In other words, the seeming excess of population that Malthus attributed to the seemingly innate disposition of the poor to reproduce beyond their means actually emerged as a product of the very dynamic of [[capitalism|capitalist]] economy.

Engels called Malthus's hypothesis "the crudest, most barbarous theory that ever existed, a system of despair which struck down all those beautiful phrases about love thy neighbour and world citizenship".&lt;ref name="Engels, Friedrich 1844"&gt;Engels, Friedrich, "Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy", original in DEUTSCHFRANZÖSISCHE JAHRBÜCHER, First (and only) Issue, February 1844, reprinted in Meek (1971), (transl. not specified)&lt;/ref&gt; Engels also predicted&lt;ref name="Engels, Friedrich 1844"/&gt; that science would solve the problem of an adequate food supply.

In the Marxist tradition, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] sharply criticized Malthusian theory and its neo-Malthusian version,&lt;ref&gt;
See V. I. Lenin: "[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/jun/29.htm The Working Class and NeoMalthusianism]" in ''[[Pravda]]'' No. 137, 16 June 1913; see also {{cite web |url=http://www.rcgfrfi.easynet.co.uk/ww/lenin/1913-wcn.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014024047/http://www.rcgfrfi.easynet.co.uk/ww/lenin/1913-wcn.htm |archivedate=14 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
calling it a "reactionary doctrine" and "an attempt on the part of bourgeois ideologists to exonerate capitalism and to prove the inevitability of privation and misery for the working class under any social system".

In addition, many Russian philosophers could not easily apply Malthus’ population theory to Russian society in the 1840s. In England, where Malthus lived, population was rapidly increasing but suitable agricultural land was limited. Russia, on the other hand, had extensive land with agricultural potential yet a relatively sparse population. It is possible that this discrepancy between Russian and English realities contributed to the rejection of Malthus’ ''Essay on the Principle of Population'' by key Russian thinkers.&lt;ref name=Todes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Todes|first=Daniel|title=Darwin's Malthusian Metaphor and Russian Evolutionary Thought, 1869–1917|journal=The University of Chicago Press|date=Dec 1987|volume=78|issue=4|pages=537–551}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another difference which contributed to the confusion and ultimately the rejection of Malthus's argument in Russia was its cultural basis in English capitalism.&lt;ref name="Todes"/&gt;  This political contrast helps explain why it took Russia twenty years to publish a review of the work and fifty years to translate Malthus's Essay.&lt;ref name="Todes"/&gt;

=== Later responses ===
In the 20th century, those who regarded Malthus as a failed prophet of doom included an editor of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', [[John Maddox]].&lt;ref&gt;Maddox, John 1972. ''The Doomsday Syndrome: an assault on pessimism''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Julian Lincoln Simon]] has criticised Malthus's conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Simon J.L. 1981. ''The ultimate resource''; and 1992 ''The ultimate resource II''.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that despite the predictions of Malthus and of the Neo-[[Malthusians]], massive [[geometric progression|geometric]] [[population]] growth in the 20th century did not result in a [[Malthusian catastrophe]]. Many factors have been identified as having contributed: general improvements in [[farming]] methods ([[industrial agriculture]]), mechanization of work ([[tractors]]), the introduction of high-yield varieties of [[wheat]] and other plants ([[Green Revolution]]), the use of [[pesticides]] to control crop pests. Each played a role.&lt;ref&gt;
Antony Trewavas: [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v418/n6898/full/nature01013.html "Malthus foiled again and again"], in ''Nature'' 418, 668–670 (8 August 2002), retrieved 28 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[The Skeptical Environmentalist|enviro-sceptic]] [[Bjørn Lomborg]] presented data to argue the case that the [[biosphere|environment]] had actually improved,&lt;ref&gt;Lomborg, Bjorn. 2001. ''The Skeptical Environmentalist''. Cambridge UP, London. Chapter 5 Food and hunger, pp60–69; and note also Part III: "Can human prosperity continue?" pp91–160.&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[calories]] produced per day per capita globally went up 23% between 1960 and 2000, despite the doubling of the [[world population]] in that period.&lt;ref&gt;Graph in Lomborg 2001 p61; data from [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] database http://apps.fao.org/ {{Webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020911120249/http://apps.fao.org/ |date=11 September 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the opposite angle, [[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], a [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field|progenitor]] in [[economics]] and a [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts|paradigm founder]] of [[ecological economics]], has argued that Malthus was too optimistic, as he failed to recognize any upper limit to the growth of population — only, the [[Geometric series#Common ratio|geometric increase]] in human numbers is occasionally slowed down (checked) by the [[Arithmetic progression|arithmetic increase]] in agricultural produce, according to Malthus' simple growth model; but some upper limit to population is bound to exist, as the total amount of agricultural land — actual as well as potential — on Earth is finite, Georgescu-Roegen points out.&lt;ref name=ngr02/&gt;{{rp|366–369}} Georgescu-Roegen further argues that the industrialised world's increase in agricultural productivity since Malthus' day has been brought about by a mechanisation that has substituted a scarcer source of input for the more abundant input of solar radiation: [[Agricultural machinery|Machinery]], [[Fertilizer|chemical fertilisers]] and [[pesticide]]s all rely on mineral resources for their operation, rendering modern agriculture — and the industrialised food processing and distribution systems associated with it — almost as dependent on Earth's mineral stock as the industrial sector has always been. Georgescu-Roegen cautions that this situation is a major reason why the [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use.&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt;{{rp|303}} Political advisor [[Jeremy Rifkin]] and ecological economist [[Herman Daly]], two students of Georgescu-Roegen, have raised similar [[Malthusianism#Modern Malthusianism|neo-Malthusian]] concerns about the long run drawbacks of modern mechanised agriculture.&lt;ref name=jr01/&gt;{{rp|136–140}} &lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|10f}}

Anthropologist Eric Ross depicts Malthus's work as a rationalization of the social inequities produced by the [[Industrial Revolution]], anti-immigration movements, the eugenics movement{{clarify|date=March 2010}} and the various international development movements.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Eric B. 1998. ''The Malthus factor: population, poverty, and politics in capitalist development''. Zed Books, London, 1998. {{ISBN|1-85649-564-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social theory ===
Despite use of the term "Malthusian catastrophe" by detractors such as economist [[Julian Lincoln Simon|Julian Simon]] (1932–1998), Malthus himself did not write that mankind faced an inevitable future catastrophe. Rather, he offered an evolutionary social theory of population dynamics as it had acted steadily throughout all previous history.&lt;ref&gt;See Elwell (2001) for an extended exposition&lt;/ref&gt; Eight major points regarding population dynamics appear in the ''1798 Essay'':{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}

# subsistence severely limits population-level
# when the means of subsistence increases, population increases
# population-pressures stimulate increases in productivity
# increases in productivity stimulate further population-growth
# because productivity increases cannot maintain the potential rate of population growth, population requires strong checks to keep parity with the [[carrying-capacity]]
# individual cost/benefit decisions regarding sex, work, and children determine the expansion or contraction of population and production
# checks will come into operation as population exceeds subsistence-level
# the nature of these checks will have significant effect on the larger sociocultural system—Malthus points specifically to misery, vice, and poverty

Malthusian social theory influenced [[Herbert Spencer]]'s idea of the [[survival of the fittest]],&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Herbert 1864. ''Principles of Biology'', vol. 1, p 444&lt;/ref&gt; and the modern ecological-evolutionary social theory of [[Gerhard Lenski]] and [[Marvin Harris]].&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, Gerhard. Ecological-evolutionary theory: Principles and applications. Routledge, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Malthusian ideas have thus contributed to the canon of [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic theory]].

The first Director-General of [[UNESCO]], [[Julian Huxley]], wrote of ''The crowded world'' in his ''Evolutionary Humanism'' (1964), calling for a world population policy. Huxley openly criticised [[communist]] and [[Roman Catholic]] attitudes to [[birth control]], [[population control]] and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].

=== Biology ===
{{further|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}

[[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] each read and acknowledged the role played by Malthus in the development of their own ideas. Darwin referred to Malthus as "that great philosopher",&lt;ref&gt;Letter to J.D. Hooker, 5 June 1860&lt;/ref&gt; and said: "This is the doctrine of Malthus, applied with manifold force to the animal and vegetable kingdoms, for in this case there can be no artificial increase of food, and no prudential restraint from marriage".&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles 1859. ''On the origin of species by means of natural selection''. Murray, London. p 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin also wrote:

{{quote|"In October 1838&amp;nbsp;... I happened to read for amusement Malthus on ''Population''&amp;nbsp;... it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new species."|Barlow, Nora 1958. ''The autobiography of Charles Darwin''. p128}}

Wallace stated:

{{quote|"But perhaps the most important book I read was Malthus's ''Principles of Population''&amp;nbsp;... It was the first great work I had yet read treating of any of the problems of philosophical biology, and its main principles remained with me as a permanent possession, and twenty years later gave me the long-sought clue to the effective agent in the evolution of organic species.|Wallace, Alfred Russel 1908. ''My life: a record of events and opinions''.&lt;ref&gt;New edition, condensed and revised. Chapman &amp; Hall, London.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Ronald Fisher]] commented sceptically on Malthusianism as a basis for a theory of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;
Quoted in: {{cite book |last=Sober |first=Elliott |authorlink= Elliott Sober |title= The Nature of Selection: Evolutionary Theory in Philosophical focus |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6bLZQzDd0f4C&amp;pg=PA194&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=2 |accessdate= 2010-03-29 |series=''Bradford books'' |year=1993 |publisher= University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-76748-2 |pages=194–195 of 383 |quote= Malthusianism is not a proper starting point for the theory of natural selection for reasons made abundantly clear by Fisher (1930, pp.&amp;nbsp;46–47).&amp;nbsp;...

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[John Maynard Smith]] doubted that famine functioned as the great leveller, as portrayed by Malthus, but he also accepted the basic premises:

: Populations cannot increase geometrically forever. Sooner or later, a shortage of resources must bring the increase to a halt.

=== Later influence ===
Malthusian ideas continue to have considerable influence. [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] has written several books predicting famine as a result of population increase: ''[[The Population Bomb]]'' (1968); ''Population, resources, environment: issues in human ecology'' (1970, with Anne Ehrlich); ''The end of affluence'' (1974, with Anne Ehrlich); ''The population explosion'' (1990, with Anne Ehrlich). In the late 1960s Ehrlich predicted that hundreds of millions would die from a coming overpopulation-crisis in the 1970s. Other examples of work that has been accused of "Malthusianism" include the 1972 book ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' (published by the [[Club of Rome]]) and the [[The Global 2000 Report to the President|Global 2000]] report to the then [[President of the United States]] [[Jimmy Carter]]. [[Science fiction|Science-fiction]] author [[Isaac Asimov]] issued many appeals for population-control reflecting the perspective articulated by people from Robert Malthus through [[Paul R. Ehrlich]].

[[Ecological economics|Ecological economist]] [[Herman Daly]] has recognized the influence of Malthus on his own work on [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state economics]].&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|xvi}}

More {{As of|2007|alt=recently}}, a school of "neo-Malthusian" scholars has begun to link population and economics to a third variable, political change and political violence, and to show how the variables interact. In the early 1980s, [[Jack Goldstone]] linked population variables to the [[English Revolution]] of 1640–1660{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} and [[David Lempert]] devised a model of demographics, economics, and political change in the multi-ethnic country of [[Mauritius]]. Goldstone has since modeled other revolutions by looking at demographics and economics{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} and Lempert has explained [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge|purges]] and the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] in terms of demographic factors that drive political economy. [[Ted Robert Gurr]] has also modeled political violence, such as in the [[Palestinian territories]] and in [[Rwanda]]/[[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] (two of the world's regions of most rapidly growing population) using similar variables in several comparative cases. These approaches suggest that political ideology follows demographic forces.

Malthus, sometimes regarded as the founding father of modern demography,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.novelguide.com/a/discover/epop_02/epop_02_00223.html |title= Malthus, Thomas Robert |accessdate= 2008-07-31 |last= Winch |first=Donald |year=2003 |work= Novelguide.com |publisher= Macmillan Reference USA |quote=At this stage, Malthus had not yet reached the level of analysis that would later lead him to be called the founding father of modern demography.}}&lt;/ref&gt; continues to inspire and influence futuristic visions, such as those of [[K.&amp;nbsp;Eric Drexler]] relating to [[space advocacy]] and [[molecular nanotechnology]]. As Drexler put it in ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' (1986): "In a sense, opening space will burst our limits to growth, since we know of no end to the universe. Nevertheless, Malthus was essentially right."

The [[Malthusian growth model]] now bears Malthus's name. The [[logistic function]] of [[Pierre François Verhulst]] (1804–1849) results in the [[Sigmoid function|S-curve]]. Verhulst developed the [[logistic growth model]] favored by so many critics of the Malthusian growth model in 1838 only after reading Malthus's essay. Malthus has also inspired retired physics professor, [[Albert Allen Bartlett]], to lecture over 1,500 times on "Arithmetic, Population, and Energy", promoting [[sustainable living]] and explaining the mathematics of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].

Established in 2015, the '''Artists' File Initiative''' ('''AFI''') is an archival project located in [[The Spencer Art Reference Library]] at the [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]].

The mission of AFI is to create archival files documenting the careers of the creative community of [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. In pursuit of this mission, the Artists' File Initiative takes an active role in collaborating with artists to create in-depth archival files documenting their artistic career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ouyang|first1=Fannie|title=Preserving Artist Legacies with Marilyn Carbonell|url=http://artiststudioarchives.org/2016/02/15/preserving-artist-legacies-with-marilyn-carbonell/|website=Artists' Studio Archive|publisher=Wordpress|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project helps local artists preserve their legacy, as well as provides access to researchers who request information on local artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lang|first1=Alexia|title=Artists' File Initiative Documents Accomplishments of Kansas City Artists.|url=http://kcstudio.org/artists-file-initiative-documents-accomplishments-of-kansas-city-artists/|website=KC Studio|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The files are a resource that is used by scholars, artists, curators and anyone interested in learning more about the arts community in this region.

==Contributors==
Before the beginning of this project, Marilyn Carbonell, head of Library Services, spoke with gallerists, artists, the museum's director, trustees, and the Nelson-Atkins Museum Business Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ouyang|first1=Fannie|title=Preserving Artist Legacies with Marilyn Carbonell|url=http://artiststudioarchives.org/2016/02/15/preserving-artist-legacies-with-marilyn-carbonell/|website=Artists' Studio Archives|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Todd Weiner, of Todd Weiner Gallery in [[Crossroads, Kansas City]], has worked as an artist liaison on this project, and assists Carbonell in connecting with artists wishing to participate by depositing material in the artists' files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lang|first1=Alexia|title=Artists' File Initiative Documents Accomplishments of Kansas City Artists.|url=http://kcstudio.org/artists-file-initiative-documents-accomplishments-of-kansas-city-artists/|website=KC Studio|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janet Simpson, Executive Director of the Kansas City Artists Coalition, also plays an active role in AFI by encouraging artists to archive and letting artists know about AFI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lang|first1=Alexia|title=Artists' File Initiative Documents Accomplishments of Kansas City Artists.|url=http://kcstudio.org/artists-file-initiative-documents-accomplishments-of-kansas-city-artists/|website=KC Studio|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The files themselves are co-curated with an art librarian and the contributing artist.

==Process==
The process of creating the files begins with library staff reaching out to museum leaders, curators, library staff, commercial galleries and artists organizations to identify prominent local artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lang|first1=Alexia|title=Artists' File Initiative Documents Accomplishments of Kansas City Artists.|url=http://kcstudio.org/artists-file-initiative-documents-accomplishments-of-kansas-city-artists/|website=KC Studio|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From there, Carbonell creates what she calls a "decision matrix," and logs each artists' accomplishments such as their completion of art school, their exhibitions and recommendations from various organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lang|first1=Alexia|title=Artists' File Initiative Documents Accomplishments of Kansas City Artists.|url=http://kcstudio.org/artists-file-initiative-documents-accomplishments-of-kansas-city-artists/|website=KC Studio|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there, she contacts the artists directly to create a comprehensive file of their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lang|first1=Alexia|title=Artists' File Initiative Documents Accomplishments of Kansas City Artists.|url=http://kcstudio.org/artists-file-initiative-documents-accomplishments-of-kansas-city-artists/|website=KC Studio|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system for the cataloging criteria is called the [https://www.arlisna.org/publications/arlis-na-research-reports/146-artist-files-revealed Artist Files Revealed] through the [[Art Libraries Society of North America]].

A '''Chad''', in derogatory [[slang]], is a young [[urban area|urban]] [[White American|white]] [[man]], typically single and in his 20s or early 30s.&lt;ref&gt;Kaduk, Kevin. ''Wrigleyworld: A Season in Baseball's Best Neighborhood'' (NAL Hardcover, 2006) {{ISBN|978-0-451-21812-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The term originated during the 1990s in [[Chicago, Illinois]],&lt;ref name=red&gt;{{cite news | title = Talk of the town | author = Tracy Swartz | work = Chicago Redeye (Tribune Co.) | date = April 24, 2008 | accessdate = 2 April 2014 |  url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-04-24/news/0804240648_1_chads-south-side-trader-joe}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was further popularized by a [[satire|satirical]] website dedicated to the ''Lincoln Park Chad Society'', a fictional [[social club]] based in Chicago's upscale [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park neighborhood]]. The female counterpart to the Chad, in slang, is the "[[Trixie (slang)|Trixie]]".&lt;ref name=flak&gt;{{cite news | title = Lincoln Park Trixie Society | author = Clay Risen | work = Flak Magazine | date = Aug 20, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Chad was originally depicted as originating in Chicago's affluent [[North Shore (Chicago)|North Shore]] suburbs ([[Highland Park, Illinois|Highland Park]], [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Deerfield, Illinois|Deerfield]], [[Northbrook, Illinois|Northbrook]], [[Glenview, Illinois|Glenview]], [[Glencoe, Illinois|Glencoe]], [[Winnetka, Illinois|Winnetka]], [[Wilmette, Illinois|Wilmette]], or [[Lake Forest, Illinois|Lake Forest]]), receiving a [[BMW]] for his 16th birthday, obtaining a law or business degree from a [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] University, belonging to a [[fraternity]], moving to Lincoln Park, marrying a Trixie, and then moving back to the North Suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115213211/http://www.lpchad.com/lifecycle/|title=» Lifecycle|date=15 January 2008|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1243">In [[grammar]], a '''circumstantial voice''', or '''circumstantial passive voice''', is a [[grammatical voice|voice]] that promotes an [[oblique argument]] of a [[verb]] to the role of [[subject (grammar)|subject]]; the underlying subject may then be expressed as an oblique argument. A given language may have several circumstantial voices, each promoting a different oblique argument. One very common circumstantial voice is the ordinary [[passive voice]], which promotes a [[patient (grammar)|patient]] to the subject position.

Circumstantials are conceptually similar to [[applicative voice|applicative]]s, which promote obliques to [[direct object]]s. However, applicatives may increase the [[valency (linguistics)|valency]] of an [[intransitive verb]] by adding a direct object, while circumstantials cannot.

Circumstantials are found in the [[Malagasy language]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2169">The '''r-to-1 collision problem''' is an important theoretical problem in [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], [[quantum computing]], and [[computational mathematics]]. The collision problem most often refers to the 2-to-1 version:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |author = Scott Aaronson |authorlink = Scott Aaronson|title = Limits on Efficient Computation in the Physical World |year = 2004|url = http://www.scottaaronson.com/thesis.pdf|format=[[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; given &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; even and a function &lt;math&gt;f:\,\{1,\ldots,n\}\rightarrow\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;, we are promised that f is either [[One-to-one function|1-to-1]] or 2-to-1. We are only allowed to make queries about the value of &lt;math&gt;f(i)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;i\in\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;. The problem then asks how many such queries we need to make to determine with certainty whether f is 1-to-1 or 2-to-1.

== Bayagbag Condition ==

=== Deterministic ===

Solving the 2-to-1 version deterministically requires &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{n}{2}+1&lt;/math&gt; queries, and in general distinguishing r-to-1 functions from 1-to-1 functions requires &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{n}{r} + 1&lt;/math&gt; queries.

This is a straightforward application of the [[pigeonhole principle]]: if a function is r-to-1, then after &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{n}{r} + 1&lt;/math&gt; queries we are guaranteed to have found a collision. If a function is 1-to-1, then no collision exists. Thus, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{n}{r} + 1&lt;/math&gt; queries suffice. If we are unlucky, then the first &lt;math&gt;n/r&lt;/math&gt; queries could return distinct answers, so &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{n}{r} + 1&lt;/math&gt; queries is also necessary.

=== Randomized ===

If we allow randomness, the problem is easier. By the [[birthday paradox]], if we choose (distinct) queries at random, then with high probability we find a collision in any fixed 2-to-1 function after &lt;math&gt;\Theta(\sqrt{n})&lt;/math&gt; queries.

== Quantum Solution ==
The [[BHT algorithm]], which uses [[Grover's algorithm]], solves this problem optimally by only making &lt;math&gt;O(n^{1/3})&lt;/math&gt; queries to ''f''.

'''Dunbar's number''' is a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships—relationships in which an [[individual]] knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person.&lt;ref name="dunbar92"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |title=The Tipping Point – How Little Things Make a Big Difference |year= 2000 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |isbn=0-316-34662-4 |pages=177–181, 185–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number was first proposed in the 1990s by British [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Robin Dunbar]], who found a correlation between primate brain size and average social group size.&lt;ref name="facebook study"/&gt; By using the average human brain size and extrapolating from the results of primates, he proposed that humans can comfortably maintain only 150 stable relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Cognitive Neuroscience|first=Dale|last=Purves|publisher=Sinauer Associates|location=Sunderland, Mass.|isbn=9780878936946|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunbar explained it informally as "the number of people you would not feel embarrassed about joining uninvited for a drink if you happened to bump into them in a bar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nN5DFNT-6ToC&amp;pg=PA77|title=Grooming, gossip, and the evolution of language|date=1998|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=0674363361|edition=1st Harvard University Press paperback|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=77|pages=|quote=|via=|last1=Dunbar|first1=Robin|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents assert that numbers larger than this generally require more restrictive rules, laws, and enforced norms to maintain a stable, [[group cohesiveness|cohesive]] [[social group|group]].  It has been proposed to lie between 100 and 250, with a commonly used value of 150.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv=0905.3704 |title=Unravelling the size distribution of social groups with information theory on complex networks |work=Preprint |year=2009 |first=A. |last=Hernando |first2=D. |last2=Villuendas |first3=C. |last3=Vesperinas |first4=M. |last4=Abad |first5=A. |last5=Plastino |bibcode=2009arXiv0905.3704H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/06/04/136723316/dont-believe-facebook-you-only-have-150-friends |title=Don't Believe Facebook; You Only Have 150 Friends |work=NPR |date=4 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunbar's number states the number of people one knows and keeps social contact with, and it does not include the number of people known personally with a ceased social relationship, nor people just generally known with a lack of persistent social relationship, a number which might be much higher and likely depends on [[long-term memory]] size.

Dunbar theorised that "this limit is a direct function of relative [[neocortex]] size, and that this in turn limits group size [...] the limit imposed by neocortical processing capacity is simply on the number of individuals with whom a stable inter-personal relationship can be maintained". On the periphery, the number also includes past colleagues, such as high school [[Friendship|friends]], with whom a person would want to reacquaint himself or herself if they met again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sorry, You May Have Gone Over Your Limit Of Network Friends |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119518271549595364?mod=googlenews_wsj |author=Carl Bialik |date=16 November 2007 |publisher=The Wall Street Journal Online |accessdate=2007-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research background==
[[Primatologist]]s have noted that, due to their highly social nature, [[primate]]s must maintain personal contact with the other members of their social group, usually through [[social grooming]]. Such social groups function as protective [[clique]]s within the physical groups in which the primates live. The number of social group members a primate can track appears to be limited by the volume of the neocortex.  This suggests that there is a species-specific index of the social group size, computable from the species' mean neocortical volume.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In 1992,&lt;ref name="dunbar92"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dunbar | first1 = R. I. M. | authorlink1 = Robin Dunbar| title = Neocortex size as a constraint on group size in primates | doi = 10.1016/0047-2484(92)90081-J | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 469–493| year = 1992 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunbar used the correlation observed for non-human primates to predict a social group size for humans.  Using a regression equation on data for 38 primate [[genera]], Dunbar predicted a human "mean group size" of 148 (casually rounded to 150), a result he considered exploratory due to the large error measure (a 95% confidence interval of 100 to 230).&lt;ref name="dunbar92"/&gt;

Dunbar then compared this prediction with observable group sizes for humans.  Beginning with the assumption that the current mean size of the human neocortex had developed about 250,000 years ago, during the [[Pleistocene]], Dunbar searched the [[anthropological]] and [[ethnographical]] literature for census-like group size information for various [[hunter–gatherer]] societies, the closest existing approximations to how anthropology reconstructs the Pleistocene societies. Dunbar noted that the groups fell into three categories—small, medium and large, equivalent to [[Band society|bands]], [[Kinship|cultural lineage groups]] and [[tribe]]s—with respective size ranges of 30–50, 100–200 and 500–2500 members each.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Dunbar's surveys of village and tribe sizes also appeared to approximate this predicted value, including 150 as the estimated size of a [[Neolithic]] farming village; 150 as the splitting point of [[Hutterite]] settlements; 200 as the upper bound on the number of academics in a discipline's sub-specialisation; 150 as the basic unit size of professional [[armies]] in [[Ancient Rome|Roman antiquity]] and in [[modern world|modern times]] since the 16th century; and notions of appropriate [[Company (military unit)|company]] size.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Dunbar has argued that 150 would be the mean group size only for communities with a very high incentive to remain together. For a group of this size to remain cohesive, Dunbar speculated that as much as 42% of the group's time would have to be devoted to social grooming. Correspondingly, only groups under intense survival pressure,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} such as [[subsistence farming|subsistence]] villages, [[nomad]]ic tribes, and historical [[war|military]] groupings, have, on average, achieved the 150-member mark. Moreover, Dunbar noted that such groups are almost always physically close: "[...] we might expect the upper limit on group size to depend on the degree of social dispersal. In dispersed societies, individuals will meet less often and will thus be less familiar with each other, so group sizes should be smaller in consequence." Thus, the 150-member group would occur only because of absolute necessity—due to intense environmental and economic pressures.

Dunbar, in ''[[Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language]]'', proposes furthermore that [[language]] may have arisen as a "cheap" means of social grooming, allowing early humans to maintain social cohesion efficiently. Without language, Dunbar speculates, humans would have to expend nearly half their time on social grooming, which would have made productive, cooperative effort nearly impossible. Language may have allowed societies to remain cohesive, while reducing the need for physical and social intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunbar |first=Robin|authorlink=Robin Dunbar |title=Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language |year=1998 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-36336-1 |url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674363366}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation | first1 = Robin | last1 =  Dunbar | date = 2004 | journal = Review of General Psychology | number = 2 | pages = 100–110 | title = Gossip in Evolutionary Perspective | url = http://attach.matita.net/ziorufus/Dunbar%20gossip.pdf | accessdate = 2013-01-24 | volume = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This result is confirmed by the mathematical formulation of the social brain hypothesis, that showed that it is unlikely that increased brain size would have led to large groups without the kind of complex communication that only language allows.&lt;ref name=":DavidBarrett1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Dávid-Barrett|first = T.|last2 = Dunbar|first2 = R.

Dunbar's number has since become of interest in anthropology, [[evolutionary psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/clas/events/gap_conference/VirtualResistanceInternetMediatedNetworks-Themudo.pdf |title=Virtual Resistance: Internet-mediated Networks (Dotcauses) and Collective Action Against Neoliberalism |format=pg. 36 |author=Nuno Themudo |date=23 March 2007 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh, University Center for International Studies |accessdate=2007-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090709211613/http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/clas/events/gap_conference/VirtualResistanceInternetMediatedNetworks-Themudo.pdf |archivedate=9 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[statistics]], and [[business management]]. For example, developers of [[social software]] are interested in it, as they need to know the size of social networks their software needs to take into account; and in the modern military, operational psychologists seek such data to support or refute policies related to maintaining or improving [[unit cohesion]] and morale. A recent study has suggested that Dunbar's number is applicable to [[Social networking service|online social networks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Modeling Users' Activity on Twitter Networks: Validation of Dunbar's Number|first1=Bruno|last1=Gonçalves|first2=Nicola|last2=Perra|first3=Alessandro|last3=Vespignani|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0022656|doi-access=free|date=3 August 2011|journal=PLoS One|volume=6|issue=8|bibcode=2011PLoSO...622656G}}

==Alternative numbers==

Anthropologist H. Russell Bernard, [[Peter Killworth]] and associates have done a variety of field studies in the United States that came up with an estimated mean number of ties, 290, which is roughly double Dunbar's estimate. The Bernard–Killworth [[median]] of 231 is lower, due to upward straggle in the distribution, but still appreciably larger than Dunbar's estimate. The Bernard–Killworth estimate of the maximum likelihood of the size of a person's [[social network]] is based on a number of field studies using different methods in various populations. It is not an average of study averages but a repeated finding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCarty |first=C. |last2=Killworth |first2=P. D. |last3=Bernard |first3=H.

[[Philip Lieberman]] argues that since band societies of approximately 30–50 people are bounded by [[nutrition]]al limitations to what group sizes can be fed without at least rudimentary [[agriculture]], big human brains consuming more nutrients than ape brains, group sizes of approximately 150 cannot have been selected for in paleolithic humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9780691148588|title=The Unpredictable Species: What Makes Humans Unique|last=Lieberman|first=Philip|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Dubious|date=December 2017}} Brains much smaller than human or even mammalian brains are also known to be able to support social relationships, including [[social insect]]s with hierarchies where each individual knows its place (such as the [[paper wasp]] with its societies of approximately 80 individuals &lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|series=Micro Monsters 3D|last=Attenborough|first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[computer]]-simulated virtual autonomous agents with simple reaction programming emulating what is referred to in primatology as "ape politics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= How the Body Shapes the Way We Think: A New View of Intelligence|last1= Pfeifer|first1=Rolf|last2=Bongard|first2=Josh|isbn=9780262162395|date=October 2006|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparisons of primate species show that what appears to be a link between group size and brain size, and also what species do not fit such a correlation, is explainable by diet. Many primates that eat specialized diets that rely on scarce food have evolved small brains to conserve nutrients and are limited to living in small groups or even alone, and they lower average brain size for solitary or small group primates. Small-brained species of primate that are living in large groups are successfully predicted by diet theory to be the species that eat food that is abundant but not very nutritious. Along with the existence of complex deception in small-brained primates in large groups with the opportunity (both abundant food eaters in their natural environments and originally solitary species that adopted social lifestyles under artificial food abundances), this is cited as evidence against the model of social groups selecting for large brains and/or intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Alex R. DeCasien, Scott A. Williams &amp; James P. Higham (2017). "Primate brain size is predicted by diet but not sociality"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularisation==

* [[Malcolm Gladwell]] discusses the Dunbar number in his popular 2000 book ''[[The Tipping Point]]''. Gladwell describes the company [[W. L. Gore and Associates]], now known for the [[Gore-Tex]] brand. By [[trial and error]], the leadership in the company discovered that if more than 150 employees were working together in one building, different social problems could occur. The company started building company buildings with a limit of 150 employees and only 150 parking spaces. When the parking spaces were filled, the company would build another 150-employee building. Sometimes these buildings would be placed only short distances apart. The company is also known for the [[open allocation]] company structure.
* The number has been used in the study of [[virtual communities]], especially [[MMORPG]]s, such as [[Ultima Online]], and [[social network service|social networking]] websites, such as [[Facebook]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13176775 |work=The Economist |title=Primates on Facebook |date=26 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Dunbar himself did a study on Facebook in 2010&lt;ref name="facebook study"&gt;{{cite web| title=Sorry, Facebook friends: Our brains can't keep up| url=https://www.cnet.com/news/sorry-facebook-friends-our-brains-cant-keep-up/| first=Don| last=Reisinger| date=25 January 2010| website=[[CNET]]| access-date=9 April 2018| quote=Dunbar has now decided to shift focus to see whether Facebook has changed the number.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[MySpace]].&lt;ref&gt;One example is Christopher Allen, "[http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/03/dunbar_altruist.html Dunbar, Altruistic Punishment, and Meta-Moderation]".&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Sweden|Swedish]] tax authority planned to reorganise its functions in 2007 with a maximum 150 employees per office, referring to Dunbar's research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/7972/20070723/|title=Swedish tax collectors organized by apes|last=|first=|date=2007-07-23|website=The Local – Sweden's news in English|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816042836/http://www.thelocal.se/7972/20070723/|archive-date=2007-08-16|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2007, [[Cracked.com]] editor [[David Wong (writer)|David Wong]] wrote a humour piece titled "What is the Monkeysphere?" explaining Dunbar's number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/article_14990_what-monkeysphere.html |title=What is the Monkeysphere? |access-date=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 2012 novel ''[[This Book Is Full of Spiders]]'', also by David Wong, the character Marconi explains to David the impact Dunbar's number has on human society. In Marconi's explanation, the limit Dunbar's number imposes on the individual explains phenomena such as racism and xenophobia, as well as apathy towards the suffering of peoples outside of an individual's community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wong|first=David|title=This Book is Full of Spiders|date=2012|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=NY|pages=295–296|isbn=0312546343}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Rikki de la Vega's "Free Spirits" series of novels (published by Sizzler Editions), the fictional Free Spirit Connection places limits on the size of local and regional groups, citing Dunbar's number, thus leading to the "birthing" of new groups and growth of the movement.
* In a piece for the Financial Times (10 Aug 2018), titled 'Why drink is the secret to humanity’s success' Dunbar mentioned two more numbers: an inner core of about 5 people to whom we devote about 40 percent of our available social time and 10 more people to whom we devote another 20 percent. All in all, we devote about two-thirds of our time to just 15 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dunbar |first1=Robin |title=Why drink is the secret to humanity’s success |url=https://www.ft.com/content/c5ce0834-9a64-11e8-9702-5946bae86e6d?segmentId=afe650f4-0d57-e9b2-a3b3-2fd03cff56c0&amp;segmentId=afe650f4-0d57-e9b2-a3b3-2fd03cff56c0#comments-anchor |publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2020">&lt;!-- created from fr.wikipedia article --&gt;'''E-corpus''' is a collective heritage digital platform founded in 2009 in France by the Centre de Conservation du Livre. Its name is sometimes written in lowercase: '''e-corpus'''.

==Introduction==

E-corpus makes known, catalogs, circulates and offers access to many millions of digital documents of all types: texts (manuscripts, archives, books, magazines) as well as iconographic heritage and cultural objects (photos, prints and engravings, sound recordings, videos, works of art). Its interface is available in several languages (French, English, Chinese, Arabic, Spanish, Catalan and Italian).

The various partners — principally libraires, museums or archives — deposit their content on this basis.

The description of the documents is hierarchical with metadata in the [[Encoded Archival Description|XML-EAD]] format, which can then be converted into other formats, notably into [[Dublin Core]]. An [[OAI-PMH]] archive permits interoperability with other platforms (Isidore (rechercheisidore.fr), [[Gallica]] (Bibliothèque nationale de France), and [[Google Books]]).

{{Progressivism}}
'''Economic progressivism''' (not to be confused with the more general [[Idea of Progress]] in relation to economic growth) is a political philosophy incorporating the socioeconomic principles of [[Social democracy|social democrats]] and [[Progressivism|political progressives]]. These views are often rooted in the concept of [[social justice]] and have the goal of improving the human condition through government-based [[Economic planning|economic central planning]]. 

Economic progressivism is based on the idea that [[free markets]] are inherently unfair, favoring large corporations and the wealthy. Progressives believe that a fair market should result in a [[normal distribution]] of wealth, but in most countries the wealthy earn heavily disproportionate incomes. Hence, progressives advocate controlling the markets through public protections that they believe will favor [[upward mobility]] and diminish [[income inequality]]. Specific economic policies that are considered progressive include [[progressive tax]]es and mandatory [[income redistribution]] aimed at reducing inequalities of wealth, a comprehensive package of [[public services]], [[universal health care]], [[public education]], [[social security]], [[minimum wage]] laws, [[Antitrust|anti-trust laws]], legislation protecting [[workers' rights]] and the rights of [[trade union]]s and a [[welfare state]].  

The progressive economic philosophy is typically defined in opposition to [[economic liberalism]] (known in some countries as [[economic libertarianism]]), ''[[laissez-faire]]'' and the conclusions of the [[Austrian School]] of economics. Many organizations that promote economic progressivism can be characterized as [[anti-capitalist]] and include principles and policies based on [[Keynesianism]], [[Marxism]] and other left-wing schools of socio-economic thought.

The '''Elizabeth Blackwell Medal''' is awarded annually by the [[American Medical Women's Association]]. The medal is named in honor of [[Elizabeth Blackwell]], the first woman to receive a medical degree in the United States and a pioneer in promoting the education of [[women in medicine]]. Established by Elise S. L'Esperance in 1949, 100 years after Blackwell received her medical degree,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elizabeth Blackwell Letters, circa 1850-1884|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/archival/collections/ldpd_4079307/|publisher=Columbia University Libraries|accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the medal is granted to a woman physician "who has made the most outstanding contributions to the cause of women in the field of medicine." Before 1993, the medal was only awarded to members of the AMWA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elizabeth Blackwell Award|url=http://www.amwa-doc.org/awards/elizabeth-blackwell|publisher=American Medical Women's Association|accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank Evans Heart''' (May 15, 1929 – June 24, 2018) was an American [[Computer engineering|computer engineer]], who, along with a team of others, designed the first [[routing]] computer for the [[ARPANET]], the predecessor to the [[Internet]].

==Background==
Heart was born in [[The Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and grew up in [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]]. His father was an engineer at the [[Otis Elevator Company]]; his mother was an insurance agent.&lt;ref name="NYTHeart"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/technology/frank-heart-who-linked-computers-before-the-internet-dies-at-89.html |title=Frank Heart, Who Linked Computers Before the Internet, Dies at 89 |last=Hafner |first=Katie |date=June 25, 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heart enrolled at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1947, entering a five-year master's degree program in which he alternated semesters between work and school. In 1951, he enrolled in MIT's new computer programming course. He became fascinated with computers and worked at the [[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]], the university's military contractor. Heart received both bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering in 1952.&lt;ref name="NYTHeart" /&gt;

==Career==
While at Lincoln Laboratory, Heart was a research assistant on [[Whirlwind I]], a computer that controlled a [[radar]] defense system for tracking aircraft. He worked at Lincoln until 1966, when he was recruited by [[BBN Technologies|Bolt, Beranek and Newman]] (BBN), a [[research and development]] company. In 1969, BBN won a proposal from [[DARPA|ARPA]] to build the first [[Interface Message Processor]] (IMP), known today as a [[router (computing)|router]], and Heart was put in charge.&lt;ref name="NYTHeart" /&gt;

Heart's team used a [[Rugged computer|rugged]] [[Honeywell 316|Honeywell DDP-516]] [[minicomputer]] to engineer the IMP, whose special function was to switch data among the computers on the ARPANET. The team also invented remote diagnostics for computers, allowing IMPs to run unattended as much as possible, including the ability to restart by themselves after a power failure or system crash. The first machines were installed at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] and, a few weeks later, at the [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] in [[Menlo Park, California]].&lt;ref name="NYTHeart" /&gt; Heart appeared in the 1972 ARPANET documentary ''[[Computer Networks: The Heralds of Resource Sharing]]''.

In 1989, the federal government decommissioned ARPANET. Most of the IMPs were disassembled; a few remain in museums and computer labs. However, many of Heart's core principles, such as reliability and [[error detection and correction]], still exist within the Internet.&lt;ref name="NYTHeart" /&gt;

In 2014, Heart was inducted into the [[Internet Hall of Fame]].

==Personal life==
While working at Lincoln Laboratory, Heart met Jane Sundgaard, one of the company's first women programmers. They married in 1959. She died in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.legacy.com/obituaries/wickedlocal-concord/obituary.aspx?n=jane-heart&amp;pid=171003807 |title=Obituary: Jane Heart |date=May 7, 2014 |access-date=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died of [[melanoma]] at age 89 in a retirement community in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]]. They are survived by three children.&lt;ref name="NYTHeart" /&gt;

This was the site of the 1848 discovery of the first Neanderthal skull by Lieutenant Edmund Flint (d. 12 January 1857) of the [[Royal Artillery]].&lt;ref name=seven&gt;{{cite news|title=A historical event|url=http://www.7daysgibraltar.net/article.php?id=4256|accessdate=11 October 2012|newspaper=7 Days – Gibraltar's Free Weekly Newspaper}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=geology&gt;{{cite journal |author2=Stringer, Christopher B. |title=Gibraltar woman and Neanderthal Man|journal=[[Geology Today]]|date=September–October 1997|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/78902886/Gibraltar-Woman-and-Neanderthal-Man|accessdate=11 October 2012 |author=Rose, Edward P.

The fossil, an adult female skull, is referred to as [[Gibraltar 1]] or the Gibraltar Skull ''(pictured at left)''. Neanderthals were unknown at the time that the fossil was found. Lieutenant Flint, secretary of the Gibraltar Scientific Society, presented his discovery to the organisation on 3 March 1848.&lt;ref name=geology/&gt;&lt;ref name=hominid/&gt; Eight years later, in 1856, fossils were discovered in a cave of the [[Neander Valley]] near [[Düsseldorf]], [[Germany]]. Those remains were described in 1864 as ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'' by Professor [[William King (geologist)|William King]] of [[Queen's College, Galway]], now University College.&lt;ref name=geology/&gt; Later that year, the Gibraltar Skull was sent to [[England]] and exhibited by [[George Busk]] at the meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], with its similarity to the Neander Valley fossils noted. However, it wasn't until the early twentieth century{{when|date=July 2017}} that it was realized{{by whom|date=July 2017}} that Gibraltar 1 was the skull of a Neanderthal. If the skull's significance had been understood in the nineteenth century, Neanderthal Man would probably have been termed "Gibraltar Man".&lt;ref name=seven/&gt;&lt;ref name=geology/&gt;&lt;ref name=hominid/&gt;

==Discovery of Gibraltar 2==
[[File:Dorothy Garrod.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Archaeologist]] [[Dorothy Garrod]] discovered Gibraltar 2 in 1926.]]
{{History of Gibraltar}}
Additional evidence of Neanderthal occupation in Gibraltar was found at the Devil's Tower Mousterian rock shelter, also at the north face of the Rock of Gibraltar.&lt;ref name=geology/&gt;&lt;ref name=hominid/&gt;&lt;ref name=mousterian/&gt; Devil's Tower was a seventeenth century [[watchtower]] which was located at the eastern end of Devil's Tower Road.&lt;ref name=seven/&gt; The archaeological site was initially discovered by Abbé [[Henri Breuil|Henri Édouard Prosper Breuil]] (1877 &amp;ndash; 1961), who had recommended investigation. Breuil, a French [[paleontologist]] and archaeologist, is renowned for his expertise on prehistoric cave art.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

The excavations at the Devil's Tower cave started in November 1925 and continued until December 1926 in three phases. In 1926, the skull of a Neanderthal child was discovered by archaeologist [[Dorothy Garrod]].&lt;ref name=hominid/&gt;&lt;ref name=mousterian&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dorothy A.E.

Garrod found five skull fragments which were described by the archaeologist and others in ''The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'' in 1928. The five fragments were [[maxilla]]ry, [[parietal bone|parietal]], [[temporal bone|temporal]], [[cranium|cranial]], and [[mandible|mandibular]].&lt;ref name=mousterian/&gt;&lt;ref name=nespos/&gt;&lt;ref name=zurich&gt;{{cite web|title=Computer-Assisted Paleoanthropology|url=http://www.aim.uzh.ch/morpho/wiki//CAP/N3|work=aim.uzh.ch|publisher=University of Zurich|accessdate=12 October 2012|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mousterian [[flake tools|flake stone tools]] were found near the child's remains. The skull of the female{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Neanderthal child is known as Gibraltar 2 or Devil's Tower Child ''(pictured above)''.&lt;ref name=geology/&gt;&lt;ref name=hominid&gt;{{cite web|title=Hominid Hunting – The Rock of Gibraltar: Neanderthals' Last Refuge|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/hominids/2012/09/the-rock-of-gibraltar-neanderthals-last-refuge/|date=19 September 2012|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nespos&gt;{{cite web|title=Gibraltar 2|url=https://www.nespos.org/display/PublicNesposSpace/Devil's+Tower+-+individuum+(Gibraltar+2)|work=nespos.org|publisher=[[Nespos]]|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study described in 1993 in the ''[[Journal of Human Evolution]]'', the striation pattern of the [[tooth enamel|dental enamel]] of the Devil's Tower Child fossil was compared to that of modern [[hunter-gatherers]] and [[medieval]] individuals from [[Spain]]. It was found that the Devil's Tower Child had a more [[abrasive]] diet than medieval individuals. Gibraltar 2 had a high number of striations. Further, the ratio of horizontal to vertical striations suggested that Gibraltar 2 may have been primarily [[carnivorous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author2=Pérez-Pérez, A |title=The diet of the Neanderthal Child Gibraltar 2 (Devil's Tower) through the study of the vestibular striation pattern |journal=[[Journal of Human Evolution]] |date=January 1993 |volume=24 |issue=1 |author=Fox, C.

By 2008, the face of the Devil's Tower Child had been reconstructed ''(pictured below)'' at the [[University of Zurich]] by means of computer-assisted [[paleoanthropology]] (CAP). This involved using [[computed tomography]] (CT) to perform volume data acquisition of the five skull fragments unearthed by Garrod in 1926. The five cranial fragments were then transformed with the software FoRM-IT into virtual 3D images. With the five virtual images then suspended in anatomical space according to scientific criteria, the missing fragments were replaced with [[mirror images]] of the excavated fragments. By means of [[laser]] [[stereolithography]], the virtual reconstruction of the face and skull of the Devil's Tower Child was converted to a physical model. The soft tissues were then approximated using 3D Thin Plate Splining (TPS) with data from a modern child. [[Plasticine]] modelling clay was accordingly applied on the physical model to simulate soft tissue. The final model of Gibraltar 2 was then cast; finishing touches included paint and human hair ''(link to final image below)''.&lt;ref name=zurich/&gt;

==Earlier claims of Gibraltar as a refugium==
At the end of the 20th century, it was believed that the Neanderthals disappeared ''c.'' 35,000 years ago. In 2006, radiocarbon dating of charcoal from [[Gorham's Cave]], Gibraltar, suggested that Neanderthals survived in southern Spain and Gibraltar at least to 28,000 BP, well after the arrival of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' in Europe ''c.'' 45,000 years ago. More recently, new decontaminated radiocarbon dating (from the same Oxford laboratory that published the late date in 2006) suggests Neanderthals had vacated Gibraltar by 42,000 BP, earlier than elsewhere in Europe.

'''''Gishiri''''' or '''''gishri'' cutting''' is a form of [[female genital mutilation]] performed commonly by the peoples of the [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa]] and [[Fula people|Fulani]] regions of northern [[Nigeria]] and southern [[Niger]]. The procedure is believed by traditional practitioners to treat a variety of gynaecological ailments, although there is no scientific basis for this procedure, and it is considered [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="forward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forwarduk.org.uk/key-issues/fistula |title=Obstetric Fistula |publisher=Forward |date= |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word "gishiri" is [[Hausa language|Hausa]] for "salt".  It refers to the practice of Arab traders who still caravan across the [[Sahara]] to cities in northern parts of [[West Africa]], such as [[Kano, Nigeria]]. When a customer buys a quantity of salt, the trader produces a long knife and cuts a piece off a large block; this knife is similar to the kind used to produce gishiri cuts.&lt;ref name="romanzi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="forward" /&gt;

== Procedure and risks ==
A whole range of gynaecologic complaints, including difficulty in [[Childbirth|labour]], infertility, [[dyspareunia]] (pain during sex), [[pelvic organ prolapse]] and [[urinary retention]], are believed to be caused by a vagina that is too narrow in these areas. The traditional treatment is to incise the vagina. A long knife is inserted into the vagina and backward cuts from the vagina's anterior wall into the [[perineum]] are made.&lt;ref name="romanzi"&gt;{{cite web | last = Romanzi | first = Lauri | title = 'Yankan Gishiri' cutting, a home remedy, cause fistula in Niger and Nigeria | work =  | date = December 2010 | url = http://www.urogynics.org/2010/12/08/yankan-gishiri-cutting-a-home-remedy-cause-fistula-in-niger-and-nigeria/| accessdate = August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious injuries can result, such as [[fistulae]]: holes in the vaginal walls that separate it from the bladder or the rectum. Sometimes the knife is inserted down the [[urethra]] to make the cut, laying bare the entire lower urinary tract. Many women also die from hemorrhaging which results from the procedure.&lt;ref name="forward" /&gt;

Many animals, including humans, tend to live in groups, [[herd]]s, [[flock (birds)|flocks]], bands, [[Pack (canine)|packs]], [[Shoaling and schooling|shoals]], or [[Bird colony|colonies]] (hereafter: groups) of conspecific individuals. The size of these groups, as expressed by the number of people/etc in a group such as 8 groups of 9 people in each one, is an important aspect of their social environment. Group size tend to be highly variable even within the same species, thus we often need statistical measures to quantify group size and statistical tests to compare these measures between two or more samples. Group size measures are notoriously hard to handle statistically since groups sizes typically follow an [[skewness|aggregated (right-skewed) distribution]]: most groups are small, few are large, and a very few are very large. 

Statistical measures of group size roughly fall into two categories.

The distribution of colonies (vertical axis above) and the distribution of individuals (vertical axis below) across the size classes of colonies (horizontal axis). The number of individuals is given in pairs. Animal group size data tend to exhibit [[skewness|aggregated (right-skewed) distributions]], i.e. most groups are small, a few are large, and a very few are very large. Note that average individuals live in colonies larger than the average colony size. (Data from  Normandy, 1999-2000 (smoothed), Debout, 2003)]]

* Group size is the number of individuals within a group;
* '''Mean group size ''', the [[arithmetic mean]] of group sizes averaged over groups;
* '''[[Confidence interval]] for mean group size''';
* '''Median group size''', the [[median]] of group sizes calculated over groups;
* '''[[Confidence interval]] for median group size'''.

==Insiders' view of group size==

As Jarman (1974) pointed out, average individuals live in groups larger than average. Therefore, when we wish to characterize a typical (average) individual’s social environment, we should apply non-parametric estimations of group size. Reiczigel et al. (2008) proposed the following measures:

* '''Crowding''' is the size (the number of individuals) of a group that a particular individual lives in (equals to group size: 1 for a solitary individual, 2 for both individuals in a group of 2, etc.). Practically, it describes the social environment of one particular individual. This was called ''Individual Group Size'' in Jovani &amp; Mavor's (2011) paper.;
* '''Mean crowding''', i.e. the [[arithmetic mean]] of crowding measures averaged over individuals (this was called "Typical Group Size" according to Jarman's 1974 terminology);
* '''[[Confidence interval]] for mean crowding'''.

==Example==

Imagine a sample with 3 groups, where group sizes are 1, 2, and 6 individuals, respectively, then 
: '''mean group size''' (group sizes averaged over groups) equals &lt;math&gt;(1+2+6)/3=3&lt;/math&gt;;
: '''mean crowding''' (group sizes averaged over individuals) equals &lt;math&gt;(1+2+2+6+6+6+6+6+6)/9=4.555&lt;/math&gt;.

Generally speaking, given there are G groups with sizes n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,  n&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;, mean crowding can be calculated as:
: '''mean crowding'''=&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^G n^2_i/\sum_{i=1}^G n_i&lt;/math&gt;

==Statistical methods==

Due to the aggregated (right-skewed) distribution of group members among groups, the application of [[parametric statistics]] would be misleading. Another problem arises when analyzing crowding values. Crowding data consist of non-independent values, or ties, which show multiple and simultaneous changes due to a single biological event. (Say, all group members' crowding values change simultaneously whenever an individual joins or leaves.)

Reiczigel et al. (2008) discuss the statistical problems associated with group size measures (calculating [[confidence interval]]s, 2-sample tests, etc.) and offer a free statistical toolset (Flocker 1.1).

The '''International Measurement Confederation''' (abbreviated '''IMEKO''', from ''Internationale Meßtechnische Konföderation'') is a [[NGO|non-governmental]] federation of [[Metrology|metrological]] organizations. It was founded in 1958 in [[Budapest]], Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.french-metrology.com/en/international-activities/organisations/imeko.asp Article] on IMEKO at www.french-metrology.com&lt;/ref&gt;

IMEKO has member organizations in the following countries: Albania, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Congo (Democratic Republic), Croatia, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, the Republic of Korea, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Rwanda, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.

== Structure ==
IMEKO is entirely staffed from volunteers from its Member Organisations (MOs) - scientific societies or institutes of the corresponding member countries. They delegate specialists in the different fields of metrology to contribute to the work of IMEKO in the General Council, the boards and the Technical Committees (TCs). The MOs organise IMEKO events (congresses, conferences, workshops, symposia).

;General Council (GC)
:The General Council is the governing body, containing one or two delegates from each Member Organization. Sessions are held annually.

;Technical Board (TB)
:The purpose of the Technical Board is to supervise the Technical Committees. The TB is chaired by the President Elect. The TB is responsible for creating and disbanding TCs, developing proposals for new TCs, facilitating communication with the journal ''Measurement'', arranging sponsorship, the approval of events to be organized by the TCs, the support of the Editorial Board of ''Measurement'', and helping to prepare Technical Sessions and Round Tables at World Congresses.

;Technical Committees (TCs)

{{LHC}}
The '''LHCf''' ('''Large Hadron Collider forward''') is a special-purpose [[Large Hadron Collider]] experiment for astroparticle ([[cosmic ray]]) physics, and one of seven detectors in the LHC accelerator at [[CERN]]. The other six are: [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]], [[A Large Ion Collider Experiment|ALICE]], [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]], [[MoEDAL experiment|MoEDAL]], [[TOTEM]], and [[LHCb]]. LHCf is designed to study the particles generated in the "[[Pseudorapidity|forward]]" region of collisions, those almost directly in line with the colliding proton beams.  It therefore consists of two detectors, 140&amp;nbsp;m on either side of the interaction point.
Because of this large distance, it can co-exist with a more conventional detector surrounding the interaction point, and shares the interaction point IP1 with the much larger general-purpose [[ATLAS experiment]].

==Purpose==
[[Image:LHCf.jpg|thumb|left|The LHCf experiment, the smallest of the seven experiments on the LHC]]
The LHCf is intended to measure the energy and numbers of neutral [[pions]] ({{Subatomic particle|Pion0}}) produced by the collider. This will hopefully help explain the origin of [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]]s. The results will complement other high-energy cosmic ray measurements from the  [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] in Argentina, and the [[Telescope Array Project]] in Utah.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3703">'''Marchetti's constant''' is the average time spent by a person for [[commuting]] each day, which is approximately one hour. The term is a misnomer, because [[Italian people|Italian]] [[physicist]] Cesare Marchetti himself attributes the "one hour" finding to transportation analyst and engineer Yacov Zahavi.&lt;ref name="mar94"&gt;[http://www.cesaremarchetti.org/archive/electronic/basic_instincts.pdf Marchetti, C., 1994: Anthropological Invariants in Travel Behavior, Technological Forecasting and Social Change , 47 :75–88, Internal Publication, International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg, Austria]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marchetti posits that although forms of [[urban planning]] and [[transport]] may change, and although some live in villages and others in cities, people gradually adjust their lives to their conditions (including location of their homes relative to their workplace) such that the average travel time stays approximately constant.&lt;ref name="mar94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ausubel1998"&gt;[http://phe.rockefeller.edu/green_mobility/ Toward green mobility: the evolution of transport], Jesse H. Ausubel, Cesare Marchetti and Perrin Meyer, 1998 (accessed Nov 6, 2006); [http://phe.rockefeller.edu/TIP_transport/ The Evolution of Transport], April/May 2001, Jesse H. Ausubel and Cesare Marchetti. Includes observations on historical cities.&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since [[Neolithic]] times, people have kept the average time spent per day for travel the same, even though the distance may increase due to the advancements in the means of transportation.

A related concept is that of Zahavi, who also noticed that people seem to have a constant "travel time budget", that is, "a stable daily amount of time that people make available for travel."&lt;ref&gt;Metz, David, 2008: The Limits to Travel: How Far Will You Go?, 8, Earthscan, London&lt;/ref&gt; David Metz, former chief scientist at the Department of Transport, UK, cites data of average travel time in Britain drawn from the British National Travel Survey in support of Marchetti's and Zahavi's conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The work casts doubt on the contention that investment in [[infrastructure]] saves travel time. Instead, it appears from Metz's figures that people invest travel time saved in travelling a longer distance,&lt;ref&gt;The point is also made in a 2009 paper by Yves Crozet: 'Economic Development and the Role of Travel time: The key concept of accessibility' published in Commissioned Papers for the 4th International Future Urban Transport Conference of the Volvo Research and Educational Foundations, Gothenburg, Sweden, April 19–21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; a particular example of [[Jevons paradox]] described by the [[Lewis–Mogridge position]]. Because of the constancy of travel times as well as induced travel, [[Robert Cervero]] has argued that the World Bank and other international aid agencies evaluate transportation investment proposals in developing and rapidly motorizing cities less on the basis of potential travel-time savings and more on the accessibility benefits they confer.&lt;ref&gt;Cervero, Robert, 2011: Beyond Travel-Time Savings: An Expanded Framework for Evaluating Urban Transport Projects, The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank, Department for International Development, Transport Research Support Program.[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/466801468178764085/pdf/702060ESW0P1200s0in0Urban0Transport.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|a related concept in software|Capability Maturity Model}}
A '''mature technology''' is a technology that has been in use for long enough that most of its initial [[Fault (technology)|fault]]s and inherent problems have been removed or reduced by further development. In some contexts, it may also refer to technology that has not seen widespread use, but whose scientific background is well understood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/rbaef/documents/mature.pdf Defining mature technology (in the sustainability and security of energy supply and utilization)] (from a [[RBAEF]] memo, [[Dartmouth College]], Tuesday 4 December 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the key indicators of a mature technology is the [[ease of use]] for both non-[[expert]]s and professionals. Another indicator is a reduction in the rate of new breakthrough advances related to it—whereas [[invention]]s related to a (popular) immature technology are usually rapid and diverse,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/23/52/2956490.pdf How technologies evolve] (from an [[OECD]] and [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] information paper, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and may change the whole use [[paradigm]]—advances to a mature technology are usually [[wikt:incremental|incremental]] improvements only.

==Examples==
{{Citations missing|section|date=August 2016}}

===Mature technologies===
*[[Farming]], most advances are in slight improvements of breeds or in pest reduction.
*[[Motor vehicle]], widely used by non-experts, the general principles have not changed for decades.
*[[Telephone]], though considered mature, [[mobile phones]] showed a rare potential for substantial changes even in such technologies.
*[[Firearm]], typified by [[assault rifle]] technology, most advances are slight improvements as manufacturers alter balances between weight, size, firepower, range, and accuracy.
*[[Watch]], most ordinary watch movements have the same or very similar components.  Most advances are with the aesthetic looks or sub-dials on the watch face.
*[[Bicycle]], another mature form of transport.
*Schooling (approximately grades 7 to 16), is characterized by courses of a semester or year in duration, that meet on the order of three hours per week, with a structure of one instructor to many students.

===Technologies not yet fully mature===
*[[Internet]], with still partly conflicting technological and human standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.registrysolutions.co.uk/sdmxDemo/notes/SDMXSiteWebServices.htm{{Dead link|date=April 2013}} The Status and Importance of Web Services]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (from the registrysolutions.co.uk website)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Computers]] (becoming more mature due to advances in user-friendly [[operating systems]] and the decline of [[Moore's Law]]).
*[[Model (economics)|Economic models]] (still showing high [[failure rate]]s in economic prediction).
*[[Distributed ledger]] technology is currently used in a limited number of applications mainly being [[blockchain]]s, though ongoing research and potential use cases are currently being explored.

===Immature technologies===
*[[Nanotechnology]], actual industrial applications limited so far.
*[[Biotechnology]], which still doesn't solve most health and ecologic human challenges.
*[[Quantum computer]]s, so far mostly a theoretical concept.
*[[Nuclear fusion power]], mainly theoretical due to the containment energy expenditure thus far outweighs yielded energy in practice.
*[[Virtual reality]], whilst practical systems exist, the potential roadmap is estimated to require a lifetime of advances in many fields.

|}

'''Mercury-Atlas''' was a subprogram of [[Project Mercury]] that included most of the flights and tests using the [[Atlas LV-3B]] launch vehicle. The Atlas was also used for one Mercury flight under the [[Big Joe (Project Mercury)|Big Joe]] subprogram.

The Mercury mission numbering system was: a two-letter designation marking the launch vehicle type, followed by a dash, then a number designating the flight/test number. The Atlas launch vehicles used for Project Mercury were given a two- or three-digit number followed by a "-D", indicating that they were the "D" version of the Atlas.

The missions flown in Mercury-Atlas were:

* [[Mercury-Atlas 1|MA-1]] using Atlas launch vehicle "50-D"
* [[Mercury-Atlas 2|MA-2]] using Atlas launch vehicle "67-D"
* [[Mercury-Atlas 3|MA-3]] using Atlas launch vehicle "100-D"
* [[Mercury-Atlas 4|MA-4]] using Atlas launch vehicle "88-D"
* [[Mercury-Atlas 5|MA-5]] using Atlas launch vehicle "93-D"
* [[Mercury-Atlas 6|MA-6]] using Atlas launch vehicle "109-D"

The '''Milk River''' is a tributary of the [[Missouri River]], {{convert|729|mi|km|abbr=on}} long, in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Montana]] and the [[Canadian province]] of [[Alberta]]. Rising in the [[Rocky Mountains]], the river drains a sparsely populated, semi-arid [[Drainage basin|watershed]] of {{convert|23800|mi2|km2|abbr=on|0}}, ending just east of [[Fort Peck, Montana]].

==Geography==
It is formed in [[Glacier County, Montana|Glacier County]] in northwestern Montana, {{convert|21|mi|km}} north of [[Browning, Montana]], by the confluence of its South and Middle forks. The {{convert|30|mi|km|adj=on}} long South Fork and {{convert|20|mi|km|adj=on}} long Middle Fork both rise in the [[Rocky Mountains]] just east of [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]], in the [[Blackfeet Indian Reservation]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Much of the water in the North Fork is diverted from the [[St. Mary River (Alberta-Montana)|St. Mary River]] through a canal and inverted siphon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The main stream flows east-northeast into southern Alberta, where it is joined by the [[North Fork of the Milk River]], from there It flows past the town of [[Milk River, Alberta|Milk River]] and [[Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park]], then turns southeast into Montana, running east along the north side of the [[Sweetgrass Hills]], turning south, passing through the [[Fresno Dam]], then east past [[Havre, Montana|Havre]] and along the north side of the [[Fort Belknap Indian Reservation]]. Near [[Malta, Montana|Malta]], it turns north, then southeast, flowing past [[Glasgow, Montana|Glasgow]] and joining the Missouri in [[Valley County, Montana]], {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} downstream from [[Fort Peck Dam]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The watershed of the river extends into the Canadian provinces of Alberta and [[Saskatchewan]] and the US state of Montana. The watershed of the river covers an area of {{convert|61642|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. Of this {{convert|6500|km2|mi2|abbr=on|0}} lies in Alberta, {{convert|14942|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} in Saskatchewan and the remaining in Montana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
The Milk River was given its name by Captain [[Meriwether Lewis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/read/?_xmlsrc=1805-05-08.xml&amp;_xslsrc=LCstyles.xsl | title=The Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition | publisher=University of Nebraska|accessdate=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], who described the river in his journal:

:''"the water of this river possesses a peculiar whiteness, being about the colour of a cup of tea with the admixture of a tablespoonfull of milk. from the colour of its water we called it Milk river."''

This appearance results from clays and silts suspended in its waters.  These fine-grained sediments result from the erosion of soft clay-rich rocks along the Milk River basin in southern Alberta, such as the [[Foremost Formation|Foremost]], [[Oldman Formation|Oldman]] and [[Dinosaur Park Formation|Dinosaur Park]] [[Formation (stratigraphy)|formations]].&lt;ref name="Map600"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ags.gov.ab.ca/publications/pubs.aspx?series=map|title=Bedrock Geology of Alberta.

At the time of Lewis's exploration, the Milk River drainage was legally part of the United States as a component of the [[Louisiana Purchase]].  However, in 1818 U.S. negotiators [[Anglo-American Convention of 1818|swapped a portion]] of the Milk River watershed that lay north of 49° north latitude, receiving in exchange a parcel of [[Red River of the North]] drainage that had previously been part of [[British North America]]. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1908, the waters of the Milk River were the subject of a [[United States Supreme Court]] case clarifying the [[water rights]] of American [[Indian reservations]]. The case is known as ''[[Winters v. United States]]''.

'''Murderworld''' is a fictional amusement park appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Murderworld was designed by the supervillain known as [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] as a place to sadistically murder others via using carnival-themed robotics and traps, in some ways this makes it similar to a Circus of Fear archetype but it is specifically designed to be an execution camp.

==Publication history==
Murderworld first appeared in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #66 (February, 1978).

==Fictional history==
Rather than being a single location, '''Murderworld''' is the name given to the fairground/amusement park style deathtrap used by the assassin-for-hire [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]. Utilizing sophisticated robotic and holographic systems, Arcade has frequently pitted various superheroes against Murderworld, sometimes for money and sometimes merely for the challenge. Arcade has build Murderworlds under [[Manhattan]],&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Team-Up'' #66&lt;/ref&gt; on a [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] island,&lt;ref&gt;''Claws'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Antarctica]],&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' #7&lt;/ref&gt; in [[England]],&lt;ref&gt;''Excalibur'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous other locations around the world.

===First Murderworld===
The first known Murderworld was built underground beneath an amusement park in [[Manhattan]]. A large portion of this Murderworld was a large scale pinball machine used as a prelude to shake up his victims, but it also contained trapdoors, mazes, booby traps, and a variety of killer robotics.&lt;ref name="MTU66"&gt;''Marvel Team-Up'' #66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UXM123-4"&gt;''X-Men'' #123-#124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UXM204"&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #204&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] hired [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] as an assassin, [[Spider-Man]], [[Captain Britain]] and his love interest [[Courtney Ross]] became the first visitors to Murderworld. Although they escaped and destroyed a large portion of Murderworld, Arcade vowed to rebuild it bigger and better than before.&lt;ref name=MTU66&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Hired by [[Black Tom Cassidy|Black Tom]] and [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], Arcade was able to capture the [[X-Men]] off the streets of [[New York City]] to have them battle inside Murderworld. With some effort, the X-Men were able to escape and rescue [[Colleen Wing]], [[Betsy Wilford]], and [[Amanda Sefton]], who had been captured alongside them.&lt;ref name="UXM123-4"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

When Arcade was captured by [[Doctor Doom]], the reserve X-Men [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]], [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] and [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] travelled to Murderworld to rescue several hostages taken by Arcade's aide Ms. Locke. Despite Ms. Locke and Mr. Chamber's efforts, the X-Men were again able to escape.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #146&lt;/ref&gt; Mystique later made a deal with Arcade to use Murderworld as training ground for her [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #177&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shadowcat]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] found themselves trapped in Murderworld once when Arcade recruited them to save his life from Doctor Doom. However, Doom was revealed to a robot controlled by Miss Locke, who was allowed to try and kill Arcade on his birthday.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #197&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] had to infiltrate Murderworld once when Arcade abducted and trapped Judith Rassendyl, the heiress to the royal throne of [[Ruritania]].&lt;ref name="UXM204"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The original [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] had to brave the hazards Murderworld once to save the [[Homo Superior|mutant]] son of Arcade's therapist.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Fanfare'' #50&lt;/ref&gt; Courtney Ross was later again trapped in Murderworld, but she managed to escape death thanks to [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur's]] help and her own newly discovered talent at improvised comedy.&lt;ref&gt;''Excalibur'' (Vol.1) #4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

====X-Force====
After leaving [[Camp Verde]], [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] decided to use Arcade's abandoned Murderworld as the new base of operations for [[X-Force]]. Murderworld provided a secure base and training area underground, but still offered access to Manhattan making an ideal headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #40&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after X-Force took up residency in Murderworld, Arcade remotely detonated explosives hidden within it, destroying most of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;''Cable'' #21&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Warriors====
When [[Night Thrasher]] reformed the [[New Warriors]] with [[Mutants|depowered mutants]], he used the abandoned Murderworld as their base of operation. Together Night Thrasher, Kaz and Grace rebuild and converted the Murderworld mechanics into a new [[Danger Room]] for the new New Warriors to train.&lt;ref&gt;''New Warriors'' Vol 4 #3-#16&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sentience====
Years later, [[Kitty Pryde]] and [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] were trapped in the remains of this original Murderworld. They were brought there by the Murderworld mainframe, which had gained sentience and wanted to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;''A + X'' #18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doorway to Destiny===
When working with the [[Crazy Gang (Earth-616)|Crazy Gang]], Arcade kidnapped [[Courtney Ross (Earth-616)|Courtney Ross]] because she escaped from his previous Murderworld. Arcade created a theatre and Wonderland inspired Murderworld called ''The Doorway to Destiny''. However, Courtney Ross was rescued by [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]].&lt;ref&gt;''Excalibur'' #4-#5&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Britain and Shadowcat continued to have multiple run-ins with Arcade and his Murderworld.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Comics Presents'' #32-#33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Comics Presents'' #36-#38&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Mutant Town]]===
To kill [[Rictor (comics)|Rictor]] and destroy [[X-Factor Investigations]], the former [[Purifiers (comics)|Purifiers]]  Mr. Taylor hired Arcade to build a Murderworld in inside the closed [[Power Plant|Power Plant bar]] in the heart of [[Mutant Town]]. Although the members of X-Factor escaped, this Murderworld led to the complete destruction of Mutant Town.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' Vol 3 #29-#30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murder Island===
Using robot disguised as [[Kraven the Hunter]], Arcade and [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]] captured [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] and released them on Murder Island where they were hunted by several millionaires who paid for the opportunity to hunt the world's most dangerous game. After destroying the Kraven robot and facing many of the island's perils, Wolverine and Black Cat escape and capture Arcade and White Rabbit, and, as revenge, they leave the pair stranded in the [[Savage Land]].&lt;ref&gt;''Claws'' Vol 1 #1-#3&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, Arcade gave this island to Miss Coriander, who renamed the isle ''Coriander Island''.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' Vol 1 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nightmare Team-Up===
When Arcade's assassination business began to suffer because of [[Deadpool]] stealing his customers, Arcade teamed-up with [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] to get revenge. Nightmare agreed to help Arcade create a virtual reality/dream realm Murderworld as long as [[Hercules (Marvel comics)|Hercules]] would also be a prisoner. Together the created a labyrinth, but Deadpool was able to awake from the dream state by plunging a knife into his head severing the two hemispheres of his brain.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool Team-Up'' Vol 1 899&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warehouse Murderworld===
To demonstrate his Murderworld arsenal to potential clients and to restore his reputation, Arcade captured the [[Avengers Academy|students from the Avengers Academy]] and the [[Young Allies (Marvel Comics)|Young Allies]] from [[New York City]] and pitted them against his Murderworld. Fortunately, by working together, the young heroes were able escape.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Academy Giant-Size'' Vol 1 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concert===
Following the events of [[Necrosha]], Arcade was hired by [[Lois London|Mortis]] to capture her sister, [[Dazzler (comics)|Dazzler]]. To capture her, Arcade designed a concert hall and attacked her with robots versions of powerful supervillains. Although Arcade escaped, Mortis was captured.&lt;ref&gt;''Dazzler'' Vol 2 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toy Store===
Arcade once opened a toy store in [[New York City]] with [[Impossible Man]] where he sold lethal toys to unsuspecting customers. The [[Human Torch (comics)|Human Torch]], [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]], and [[Leech (comics)|Leech]] battled Arcade's toys and closed his store.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #580&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Avengers Arena|Arena Murder World]]===
After realizing he was a joke among the super villain community and hitting rock bottom, Arcade decided to build massive island arena underground in [[Antarctica]] with the assistance of Miss Coriander. With the designs of the arena completed, Arcade exercised total control over the environment and terrain of his new Arena Murderworld.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' Vol 1 7&lt;/ref&gt;

As the next part of his plan, he kidnapped sixteen superpowered teens and forced them into a 30-day game of kill or be killed.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' Vol 1 1&lt;/ref&gt; Unbeknownst the participants, their every move was being filmed. Several individuals died including [[Mettle (comics)|Mettle]],&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' Vol 1 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Red Raven (Marvel Comics)|Red Raven]],&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' Vol 1 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juston Seyfert]],&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' Vol 1 9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kid Briton]],&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' Vol 1 6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nara (comics)|Nara]],&lt;ref&gt;Avengers Arena Vol 1 15&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Apex (comics)|Apex]]&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' Vol 1 18&lt;/ref&gt; while the survivors were left physically, emotionally, and psychologically scared. The survivors vowed to never share the secrets of their experience in Murderworld with anyone. However, Arcade released his footage of Murderworld onto the internet making the survivors reluctant celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Arena'' Vol 1 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' Vol 1 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massacrer Casino===
After releasing the videos of his Arena Murderworld, Arcade went into hiding in [[Bagalia]] as revealed in the pages of ''[[Avengers Undercover]]''. To pass time and raise funds, Arcade opened the ''Massacrer Casino'' where wealthy individuals can engage in a game of kill or be killed. This lasted until some of the survivors of Arena Murderworld tracked him down, and [[Hazmat (comics)|Hazmat]] killed him (this was later revealed to have been a clone of Arcade that was created by the [[Masters of Evil]] while the real Arcade was imprisoned in Bagalia by them).&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dungeon Murderworld===

Realizing that mercenaries have less to fight for than heroes who always escape his traps, Arcade put out an add for them and lured them into a castle-dungeon role playing situation. Most notably Gwenpool and her friends Batrock the leaper, MegaTony, and the Terrible Eye (a.k.a. Sarah), a group of mutant-frog mercenaries Batroc worked with once (much to his chagrin), and Deadpool (referred to as "The Unkillable beast" and wearing a green Robinhood style cap). Things went downhill quickly however since Gwen was a geek back in her home world and thus knew all the tricks of working her way through an RPG with record speed, especially after she killed the shopkeeper-robot who offered to sell them dungeon raiding equipment and just took what she wanted, including their own gear. A good thing since Deadpool and, according to Arcade, many other mercenaries had been trapped and died there over a long period of time. After a brief misunderstanding with Deadpool she quickly led him and her team to Arcade's hiding place and took him down.

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Universe===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] reality, Murderworld is a first-person shooter video game designed by Arcade and the source of his fortune.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate X-Men'' #55-#56&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Age of X]]===
In the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, [[Alcatraz Island]] was a prison for dangerous [[Homo superior|mutants]]. Governor Harcourt Teesdale served as the director-governor. Known to his inmates as Arcade, he created mutant-themed attractions to torture and punish prisoners, which earned Alcatraz the nickname "Murderworld". A mutant named the [[Basilisk (comics)|Basilisk]] was used as an unwilling executioner for years until he was able to escape, murder Arcade, and free the mutants imprisoned there.&lt;ref&gt;''Age of X: Alpha'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe===
When [[Deadpool]] started a super human killing spree, he captured and forced [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] to build him a new Murderworld with deadlier traps than ever in order to kill the [[X-Men]].&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

===Television===
* In the [[X-Men: Evolution]], Webber Torque (or "Arcade", as he calls himself), a student from [[Bayville High School]], once managed to infiltrate the [[Xavier Institute]]'s [[Danger Room]]. Mistakenly believing it was a video game simulation, he altered it into a Murderworld.
* Murderworld appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode "Game Over." Here, it has been named '''Madland'''. Spider-Man, Captain America, and Wolverine had to traverse through Madland's Murderworld location in order to get to Arcade so that they can prevent him from starting [[World War III]].

===Video Games===
* Murderworld is the setting for [[X-Men: Madness in Murderworld]], a single-player side-scrolling arcade game developed by Paragon Software in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=X-Men: Madness in Murderworld|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/x-men-madness-in-murderworld/3030-7150/|publisher=[[Giant Bomb]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Murderworld appears in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''. When the heroes used [[Doctor Strange]]'s [[Orb of Agamotto|Orb of Teleportation]] to travel to [[Latveria|Castle Doom]], they were diverted by [[Baron Mordo]] to Murderworld where they arrived in a fake Castle Doom. It was also revealed that Arcade has [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]] in Murderworld and Jean Grey was shown to be under Arcade's mind-control when found in a tent. The heroes fought their way through [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] where they end up fighting Arcade in his Arcade-Bot. Some of the Simulation Disks take place in Murderworld. In [[Deadpool]]'s disk, he is irritated greatly by Deadpool's refusal to accept that Murderworld isn't a normal theme park (although this probably is Deadpool's taunting rather than an actual lack of understanding, Deadpool's borderline insanity makes this uncertain), and forcing the mercenary to fight Dark Spider-Man (who Arcade referred to as his creation). In [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'s disk, Arcade was threatening Black Panther to give the secret codes to Wakanda's vibranium facility (which of course he doesn't tell) and forcing Black Panther to fight Dark [[Captain America]]. Storm's disk has her fight against [[Hussar (comics)|Hussa]] in Murderworld. The versus [[Mysterio]] simulator take place in Murderworld. [[Mister Fantastic]]'s disk has his fight against [[Bulldozer (comics)|Bulldozer]] in Murderworld.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8681">'''Newman's Energy Machine''' was a [[DC motor]] which the inventor, [[Joseph Westley Newman|Joseph Newman]], claimed to produce mechanical power exceeding the electrical power being supplied to it. In 1979, Newman attempted to patent the device, but was rejected by the [[United States Patent Office]] as being a [[perpetual motion machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court | litigants = Newman v. Quigg |vol=681 F.Supp 16 |reporter= |opinion=83-0001 |pinpoint= |court=United States District Court, District of Columbia |date=17 February 1988 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16083607426021457478&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006&amp;as_vis=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the rejection was later appealed, the [[United States district court]] requested that Newman's machine be tested by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Bureau of Standards]] (NBS). The NBS concluded in June 1986 that output power was not greater than the input.&lt;ref name="NBS"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the patent was again denied.&lt;ref name="appealtext"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NBS_science" /&gt; The scientific community has rejected Newman's ideas about electricity and magnetism as [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] and his claims as false.&lt;ref name="park"&gt;{{citation

== Claims by the inventor ==
By adding rolls to the armature of a motor, a larger and larger [[counter-electromotive force]] is generated on the motor.
Newman outlined his claims about there being a fundamental electromagnetic interaction in all matter ultimately derived from only one type of force particle propagating at the speed of light. Newman claims that the motor derives its power by converting some of the mass of the copper in the coils into usable energy, in application of Einstein's [[mass–energy equivalence]]. According to proponents of the Energy Machine, the most crucial part of the design concerns what happens as a result of mechanical commutation.&lt;ref name="Perpetual Motion: Still Going Around"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. patent application==
In 1979, Newman submitted an application for his device to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]].&lt;ref name="patent pursuit"/&gt; The application was eventually rejected in 1983,&lt;ref name="patent application"&gt;{{cite web
| url=https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO1983000963
| title=Patent Application: "ENERGY GENERATION SYSTEM HAVING HIGHER ENERGY OUTPUT THAN INPUT" (failed)
| author=Newman, Joseph
| date=1983-03-17
| accessdate=2015-12-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which set off a lengthy court battle.
The [[United States District Court]] requested a master of the court to make the final decision. William E. Schuyler, Jr, former Commissioner of U.S. Patent Office, Washington, DC was chosen by the court to make the final decision to award the patent or not award the patent to Newman. Schuyler supposed that evidence to support Newman's claim was overwhelming and found no contradictory factual evidence.&lt;ref name="kramer"&gt;{{cite web
| author=Kramer, Bruce

| url=http://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/akronlawreview/vol21/iss1/8/
| accessdate=2015-12-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the judge ordered Newman's machine to be tested by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Bureau of Standards]] (NBS). The National Bureau of Standards (NBS), now known as the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), by request of the patent office, tested the device for several months and got negative results. In every case presented in the NBS report, the output power was less than power input from the battery pack, and therefore the efficiency was less than 100%. The court therefore upheld the rejection of the patent application.&lt;ref name="appealtext"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Newman v. Quigg |vol=877 F.2d 1575 |court=US Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit |opinion=88-1312 | url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12975401061441893941&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr |date=5 July 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NBS_science"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newman argued that he had been mistreated by the patent office, and tried to have his motor legalized directly by the US Congress. He obtained a hearing on 30 July 1986 in front of several senators, but he was unsuccessful. During the hearing, Newman refused to have the machine tested by independent experts, and senator [[John Glenn]] pointed out that his supposedly-independent expert actually had a prior business relationship with him.

The case is now cited in the USPTO's [[Manual of Patent Examining Procedure]] as an example of an "inoperative" invention that can't have any utility, concretely as a perpetual motion machine.&lt;ref name="incredible"&gt;{{Citation | title = 2107.01 General Principles Governing Utility Rejections (R-5) - 2100 Patentability.

==Cease and desist order==

In August 2007 the Alabama Securities Commission issued a [[cease and desist]] order to the "Newman Energy Corporation", alleging it had sold unregistered stock in the company. In January 2008 the company tendered [[Rescission (contract law)|offers of rescission]] to its nine Alabama investors, offering to reverse the sales. Eight of the investors declined the offer, electing to retain their investment; the ninth did not reply. The company agreed to pay the State of Alabama $7,000 in administrative assessments and investigative costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Administrative order C0-2007-0024 Consent order|author=Alabama Securities Commission|date=26 September 2008|url=http://www.asc.state.al.us/Orders/2007/CO-2007-0024.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

The device is referenced in the [[Big Black]] song "Newman Generator", recorded for their 1987 [[John Peel#Peel sessions|Peel Session]].

'''OpenBCI''' is an [[open-source]] [[brain-computer interface]] platform,&lt;ref&gt;[http://openbci.com/ OpenBCI official page]&lt;/ref&gt; created by Joel Murphy and [[Conor Russomanno]], after a successful Kickstarter campaign in late 2013.

OpenBCI boards can be used to measure and record electrical activity produced by the brain ([[EEG]]), muscles ([[Electromyography|EMG]]), and heart ([[EKG]]), and is compatible with standard EEG electrodes. The OpenBCI boards can be used with the open source OpenBCI GUI, or they can be integrated with other open-source EEG signal processing tools.

== Hardware ==
The OpenBCI 32bit Board uses the ADS1299, an [[Integrated circuit|IC]] developed by [[Texas Instruments]] for biopotential measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/reuvencohen/2014/01/03/new-open-source-platform-allows-anyone-to-hack-brain-waves/|title = New Open Source Platform Allows Anyone To Hack Brain Waves|date = 2014-03-01|accessdate = 2014-12-16|website = Forbes|publisher = Forbes Media|last = Cohen|first = Reuven}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OpenBCI uses a [[microcontroller]] for on-board processing — the 8bit version (now deprecated) uses an [[Arduino Berlam|Arduino]]-compatible ATmega328P IC, while the 32bit board uses a [[PIC microcontroller|PIC]] microcontroller — and can write the EEG data to an SD card, or transmit it to software on a computer over a [[bluetooth]] link.

In 2015, OpenBCI announced the Ganglion board with a 2nd Kickstarter campaign. It costs $100 (1/5 the cost the 32bit board). It has 4 input channels for measuring EEG, EMG, and EKG, and is also bluetooth enabled.

== Software ==
[[File:OpenBCI Screenshot of a Basic EKG.png|alt=Screenshot of the OpenBCI Processing application displaying a basic electroencephalogram|thumb|Screenshot of the OpenBCI Processing application displaying a basic electroencephalogram]]
OpenBCI has released an open-source application for use with the OpenBCI, written with [[Processing (programming language)|Processing]]. Display and processing software written in [[NodeJS]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] are also being developed.

== 3D Printed Headset ==
[[File:UCM3.jpg|thumbnail|Conor Russomanno wearing the Ultracortex Mark III and Ganglion Board]]
Design files for a [[3D printing|3D printed]] headset for pre-production OpenBCI boards have been released on GitHub. The headset, known as the Ultracortex, holds the electrodes in place, and makes it easy to configure their placement using the [[10-20 system (EEG)|10–20 System]]. A headset design files are available for download from OpenBCI's Github account, or the headset can be purchased from the OpenBCI online store. The headsets are manufactured and produced by Voodoo Manufacturing.

== Applications ==
The OpenBCI has been used to control a HexBug robot using [[SSVEP]]s (Steady State Visually Evoked Potentials).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://neurogadget.com/2014/08/31/early-openbci-researcher-hacks-hex-bug-gives-advice-brain-hackers/10530|title = Early Openbci Researcher Hacks a Hexbug and Gives Advice to Other Brain-hackers|last = Pate|first = Josh|date = 2014-08-31|work = Neurogadget|access-date = 2015-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Locked in syndrome|Locked in]] graffiti artist [[Tempt One]] has used the OpenBCI and the low-cost [[EyeWriter|Eyewriter]] eye-tracking system to continue to draw after being diagnosed with the degenerative nerve disorder&amp;nbsp;[[ALS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://neurogadget.com/2014/09/16/brainwriter-helps-graffiti-artist-suffering-als-draw-using-openbci/10560|title = Brainwriter Helps Graffiti Artist Suffering from ALS to Draw Using Openbci|last = Pate|first = Josh|date = 2014-09-16|work = Neurogadget|access-date = 2015-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perce Blackborow''' (1896 in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] – 1949) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] sailor, a [[stowaway]] on [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s ill-fated [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]].

==Biography==
Blackborow was born in 1896 in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]]. 

===Stowaway on ''Endurance''===
Blackborow and his friend, [[William Lincoln Bakewell]] traveled to [[Buenos Aires]] looking for new employment. Bakewell was taken on as an [[able seaman]] by ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]'', but Blackborow was not hired; at 18, his youth and inexperience counted against him. Fearing that ''Endurance'' was shorthanded, Bakewell and Walter How helped Blackborow sneak aboard, and hid him in a locker amongst piles of clothing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/shackletonexped/1914/t_blackborow.html NOVA Online | Shackleton's Antarctic Odyssey | Perce Blackborow, Steward&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On the third day at sea he was discovered. 

Unable to stand, he had to remain seated in a chair when he met [[Ernest Shackleton]] for the first time. Apparently in a fit of genuine rage, Shackleton subjected the stowaway to a most severe and terrifying tirade in front of the entire crew. This had the desired effect and the reactions of the two accomplices were enough to unmask them. Shackleton finished his performance by saying to Blackborow, "Do you know that on these expeditions we often get very hungry, and if there is a stowaway available he is the first to be eaten?" To which Blackborow replied, "They’d get a lot more meat off you, sir." Shackleton hid a grin and after chatting with one of the crew members said "Introduce him to the cook first." &lt;ref&gt;Huntford, R. "Shackleton", p. 384. Carroll &amp; Graf, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackborow proved an asset to the ship as a steward and was eventually signed on, though under the promise that he would be the first eaten should they run out of food or should the men starve.

Following ''Endurance''{{'}}s entrapment and crushing, the crew relocated to [[Elephant Island]]. On arrival, Shackleton thought to give Blackborow, the youngest of the crew, the honor of being the first to step on the island, forgetting that his feet had been frostbitten. Helped over the gunwale, he fell in the shallows and was quickly carried ashore.

===Gangrene===
On 24 April the rescue party set sail in the ''[[James Caird (boat)|James Caird]]'' for [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], hoping to return in weeks. The rest of the crew resigned themselves to waiting. Almost to a man they were in poor health and spirits. Blackborow had contracted [[gangrene]] and was Macklin's greatest medical concern.

On 15 June, with Shackleton and the ''James Caird'' crew now away for a month, Macklin, assisted by McIlroy, carried out the necessary amputations. Greenstreet described the operation. "Blackborow had … all the toes of his left foot taken off ¼ inch stumps being left … The poor beggar behaved splendidly and it went without a hitch … Time from start to finish 55 minutes. When Blackborow came to he was cheerful as anything and started joking directly."&lt;ref&gt;Huntford, R. "Shackleton", p. 533. Carroll &amp; Graf, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackborow returned to live in Newport, South Wales, and received the [[Bronze Polar Medal]] for his service in the trip. He died in 1949, of chronic bronchitis and a heart problem at age 53.

==Legacy==
Blackborow's Antarctic adventures are the subject of two fictionalized accounts, ''Shackleton's Stowaway'' by Victoria McKernan ({{ISBN|0-440-41984-0}}) and ''Ice-Cold Heaven'' by Mirko Bonne ({{ISBN|978-1-59020-140-4}}).

'''SIMP J013656.5 +093347''' is a [[brown dwarf]] in the constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]]. It belongs to the spectral class T2.5 and its position shifts due to its [[proper motion]] annually by about 1.24 arcsec with a position angle of about 90°.

This brown dwarf provided the first evidence for periodic variability flux variations among T dwarfs. This has been interpreted as a signature of weather patterns coming in and out of view over the object's 2.4h rotation period. The shape of this lightcurve evolves over timescales of days, which has been interpreted as a sign of evolution of the cloud patterns in its atmosphere.

In 2017, it was announced that the object's mass may be as low as 12.7 [[Jupiter]] masses and should be considered a planet rather than a Brown Dwarf as it seems to be a member of the relatively young, 200 million-year-old Carina-Near stellar moving group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gagné|first=Jonathan|last2=Faherty|first2=Jacqueline K.|last3=Burgasser|first3=Adam J.|last4=Artigau|first4=Étienne|last5=Bouchard|first5=Sandie|last6=Albert|first6=Loïc|last7=Lafrenière|first7=David|last8=Doyon|first8=René|last9=Bardalez-Gagliuffi|first9=Daniella C.|date=2017-05-15|title=SIMP J013656.5+093347 is Likely a Planetary-Mass Object in the Carina-Near Moving Group|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01625|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=841|issue=1|pages=L1|doi=10.3847/2041-8213/aa70e2|issn=2041-8213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newatlas.com/brown-dwarf-is-a-planet/49445/|title=Presto change-o!

In 2018, astronomers noted, "Detecting SIMP J01365663+0933473 with the [[Very Large Array|VLA]] through its auroral radio emission, also means that we may have a new way of detecting exoplanets, including the elusive rogue ones not orbiting a parent star ... This particular object is exciting because studying its magnetic dynamo mechanisms can give us new insights on how the same type of mechanisms can operate in extrasolar planets - planets beyond our Solar System ... We think these mechanisms can work not only in brown dwarfs, but also in both gas giant and terrestrial planets."&lt;ref name="SA-20180803" /&gt;

One of the first occasions an article was attributed to a "scientific correspondent" was "A Gale in the Bay of Biscay" by [[William Crookes]] which appeared in ''[[The Times]]'' on January 18, 1871, page 7.&lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Becker |first1=Barbara J. |title=Unravelling Starlight: William and Margaret Huggins and the Rise of the New Astronomy |date=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781139497251 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lNkbvQCefQ4C&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=%E2%80%98A+Gale+in+the+Bay+of+Biscay%E2%80%99,+The+Times,+January+18,+1871&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UTqYEbV6tH&amp;sig=x59UgpWGxpYFHgKHzc3td0gTsGg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJioaHp9nbAhUNZ8AKHdheC6wQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%98A%20Gale%20in%20the%20Bay%20of%20Biscay%E2%80%99%2C%20The%20Times%2C%20January%2018%2C%201871&amp;f=false |accessdate=16 June 2018 |language=en}}{{rp|169}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] (1825–1895) and [[John Tyndall]] (1820–1893) were scientists who were greatly involved in journalism and [[Peter Chalmers Mitchell]] (1864–1945) was Scientific Correspondent for The Times from 1918 to 1935.&lt;ref name ="Gristock"&gt;Gristock, J. (2006) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230669213_JG_Crowther_Kuhn_and_systems_of_mediation_An_examination_of_the_science-journalism-innovation_relationship "J.G. Crowther, Kuhn and Systems of Mediation"], Paper presented at the Scientists and Social Commitment Conference, Science Museum, London, 15–17 September.&lt;/ref&gt; However it was with [[James Crowther]]'s appointment as the ‘scientific correspondent’ of [[The Manchester Guardian]] by [[C. P. Scott]] in 1928 that science journalism really took shape. Crowther related that Scott had declared that there was ‘no such thing’ as science journalism, at which point Crowther replied that he intended to invent it. Scott was convinced and then employed him.&lt;ref name ="Gristock"/&gt;

The aim of a [[science journalist]] is to render very detailed, specific, and often [[jargon]]-laden information produced by scientists into a form that non-scientists can understand and appreciate while still communicating the information accurately. One way science journalism can achieve that is to avoid an [[information deficit model]] of communication, which assumes a top-down, one-way direction of communicating information that limits an open dialogue between knowledge holders and the public.

Science journalists often have training in the scientific disciplines that they cover. Some have earned a degree in a scientific field before becoming journalists or exhibited talent in writing about science subjects. However, good preparation for interviews and even deceptively simple questions such as "What does this mean to the people on the street?" can often help a science journalist develop material that is useful for the intended audience. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Status==
With budget cuts at major newspapers and other media, there are fewer working science journalists working for traditional print and broadcast media than before.&lt;ref name="ibtimes1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zara|first=Christopher|title=Remember Newspaper Science Sections? They’re Almost All Gone|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/print/remember-newspaper-science-sections-theyre-almost-all-gone-1005680|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there are currently very few journalists in traditional media outlets that write multiple articles on emerging science, such as nanotechnology.

In 2011, there were 459 journalists who had written a newspaper article covering nanotechnology, of whom 7 wrote about the topic more than 25 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dudo, A. D.|author2=Dunwoody, S.|author3=Scheufele, D.

In January 2012, just a week after ''The Daily Climate'' reported that worldwide coverage of climate change continued a three-year slide in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fischer|first=Douglas|title=Climate coverage, dominated by weird weather, falls further in 2012|url=http://wwwp.dailyclimate.org/tdc-newsroom/2013/01/2012-climate-change-reporting|accessdate=10 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515043156/http://wwwp.dailyclimate.org/tdc-newsroom/2013/01/2012-climate-change-reporting|archivedate=15 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that among the five largest US dailies, the ''New York Times'' published the most stories and had the biggest increase in coverage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MEDIA COVERAGE OF CLIMATE CHANGE/GLOBAL WARMING|url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/media_coverage/us/|publisher=Center for Science and Technology Policy Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; that newspaper announced that it was dismantling its environmental desk and merging its journalists with other departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bagley|first=Katherine|title=New York Times Dismantles Its Environment Desk: Times says demise of the nine-person team, created in 2009, won't affect climate coverage|url=http://insideclimatenews.org/news/20130111/new-york-times-dismantles-environmental-desk-journalism-fracking-climate-change-science-global-warming-economy|publisher=Inside Climate News|accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News coverage on science by traditional media outlets, such as newspapers, magazines, radio, and news broadcasts is being replaced by online sources. In April 2012, the ''New York Times'' was awarded two Pulitzer Prizes for content published by Politico and The Huffington Post, both online sources, a sign of the platform shift by the media outlet.

New communication environments provide essentially unlimited information on a large number of issues, which can be obtained anywhere and with relatively limited effort. The web also offers opportunities for citizens to connect with others through social media and other 2.0-type tools to make sense of this information.

"After a lot of hand wringing about the newspaper industry about six years ago, I take a more optimistic view these days,” said Cristine Russell, president of the Council for the Advancement of Science Writing. “The world is online. Science writers today have the opportunity to communicate not just with their audience but globally.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zara|first=Christopher|title=Remember Newspaper Science Sections? They’re Almost All Gone|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/print/remember-newspaper-science-sections-theyre-almost-all-gone-1005680|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blog-based science reporting is filling in to some degree, but has problems of its own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/article/unpopular-science?page=full "Unpopular Science"], by Chris Mooney and Sheril Kirshenbaum, ''The Nation'', Aug. 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chocolate hoax===
{{main article|John Bohannon#Misleading chocolate study}}
In 2015, [[John Bohannon]] produced a deliberately bad study to see how a low-quality [[open access]] publisher and the media would pick up their findings. He worked with a film-maker Peter Onneken who was making a film about [[junk science]] in the diet industry with [[Food faddism|fad diets]] becoming headline news despite terrible study design and almost no evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/i-fooled-millions-into-thinking-chocolate-helps-weight-1707251800|title=I Fooled Millions Into Thinking Chocolate Helps Weight Loss. Here's How.|author=John Bohannon|work=Io9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He invented a fake "diet institute" that lacks even a website, and used the pen name, "Johannes Bohannon," and fabricated a press release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://instituteofdiet.com/2015/03/29/international-press-release-slim-by-chocolate/|title=International Press Release: Slim by Chocolate|work=instituteofdiet.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151212010740/http://instituteofdiet.com/2015/03/29/international-press-release-slim-by-chocolate/|archivedate=12 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Science journalists regularly come under criticism for misleading reporting of scientific stories. All three groups of scientists, journalists, and the public often criticize science journalism for bias and inaccuracies. However, with the increasing collaborations online between science journalists there may be potential with removing inaccuracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Novin, A.|first=Secko, D.|date=November 25, 2012|title=Debate Cited: A First Exploration of a Web Application to Enhance the Production of Science Journalism Students|url=http://cca.kingsjournalism.com/?p=171|journal=Journalism Interest Group|volume=CCA/Groupe d’intérêt en journalisme, ACC Conference Proceedings|issue=2012|doi=|pmid=|access-date=September 8, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2010 book ''[[Merchants of Doubt]]'' by [[History of science|historians of science]] [[Naomi Oreskes]] and [[Erik M. Conway]] argues that in topics like the [[global warming controversy]], [[tobacco smoking]], [[acid rain]], [[DDT]] and [[ozone depletion]], [[contrarian]] scientists have sought to "keep the controversy alive" in the public arena by demanding that reporters give [[false balance]] to the minority side. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Very often, such as with [[climate change]], this leaves the public with the impression that disagreement within the scientific community is much greater than it actually is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tigger.uic.edu/~pdoran/012009_Doran_final.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090203040819/http://tigger.uic.edu/~pdoran/012009_Doran_final.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 February 2009 |title=Examining the Scientific Consensus on Climate Change |author=Peter T. Doran |author2=Maggie Kendall Zimmerman |last-author-amp=yes |volume=90 |number=3 |date=2009-01-20 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Science is based on experimental [[evidence]], [[Test method|testing]] and not dogma, and disputation is a normal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/series/badscience |title=Bad science &amp;#124; Science |publisher=The Guardian |date= 27 July 2007|accessdate=2013-07-06 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[List of science magazines|science magazines]], along with Newspapers like ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[popular science]] shows like [[Nova (TV series)|PBS Nova]] tailor their content to relatively highly educated audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/science_needs_a_storyline.php|title=Science Needs a Storyline|work=Columbia Journalism Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities and research institutions focus much of their media outreach efforts on coverage in such outlets. Some government departments require journalists to gain clearance to interview a scientist, and require that a [[press secretary]] listen in on phone conversations between government funded scientists and journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/feature/transparency_watch_a_closed_door.php|title=Transparency Watch: A Closed Door|work=Columbia Journalism Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[pharmaceutical marketing]] representatives have come under fire for offering free meals to doctors in order to promote new drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=715157|title=Physician–Industry Relations. Part 1: Individual Physicians|work=annals.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Attitudes and Relationship between Physicians and the Pharmaceutical Industry in a Public General Hospital in Lima, Peru | pmc=4076259 | pmid=24978481 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0100114 | volume=9 | issue=6 | year=2014 | journal=PLoS ONE | pages=e100114 | last1 = De Ferrari | first1 = A | last2 = Gentille | first2 = C | last3 = Davalos | first3 = L | last4 = Huayanay | first4 = L | last5 = Malaga | first5 = G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of science journalists have argued that they should disclose whether industry groups have paid for a journalist to travel, or has received free meals or other gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/criticism/science_journalism_conflicts_of_interest.php|title=Where do science journalists draw the line?|work=Columbia Journalism Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science journalism finds itself under a critical eye due to the fact that it combines the necessary tasks of a journalist along with the investigative process of a scientist.

Most science journalists begin their careers as either a scientist or a journalist and transition to science communication.&lt;ref&gt;Zivkovic, Bora.[http://scienceprogress.org/2010/12/the-line-between-science-and-journalism-is-getting-blurry-again "The Line Between Science and Journalism is Getting Blurry Again"],"Science Progress", 21 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

One area in which science journalists seem to support varying sides of an issue is in risk communication. Science journalists may choose to highlight the amount of risk that studies have uncovered while others focus more on the benefits depending on audience and framing. Science journalism in contemporary risk societies leads to the institutionalisation of mediated scientific public spheres which exclusively discuss science and technology related issues.&lt;ref&gt;Shiju Sam Varughese. 2017. ''Contested Knowledge: Science, Media, and Democracy in Kerala''. Oxfod University Press, New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt; This also leads to the development of new professional relationship between scientists and journalists, which is mutually beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, the self-limiting nature of a colony may be advantageous to the continued survival of the colony, such as in the case of [[parasite]]s.  If their numbers became too high, they would kill the [[host (biology)|host]], and thus themselves. In other cases, self-limitation restricts the viability of predators, thus ensuring the long-term survival of rare species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A computational functional genomics based self-limiting self-concentration mechanism of cell specialization as a biological role of jumping genes|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/ib/c5ib00203f#!divAbstract|journal=Integrative Biology|first1=Jörn |last1=Lötsch|first2=Alfred |last2=Ultschc|date=2016|issue=1|volume=8|doi=10.1039/C5IB00203F|pmid=26679724|pages=91–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medicine]], the term may imply that a condition would run its course without the need of external influence, especially any medical treatment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4455">[[File:F-5E Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration aircraft.jpg|thumb|This F-5E was modified by NASA for a constant area beyond drag optimum to reduce the sonic boom]]

The [[NASA]] '''Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration''', also known as the '''Shaped Sonic Boom Experiment''', was a two-year program that used a [[Northrop F-5]]E with a modified [[fuselage]] to demonstrate that the aircraft's shock wave, and accompanying [[sonic boom]], can be shaped, and thereby reduced. The program was a joint effort between NASA's [[Langley Research Center]], [[Dryden Flight Research Center]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California and [[Northrop Grumman]].

The program became, at that time (2003 according to [[supersonic transport]]), the most extensive study on the sonic boom. After measuring the 1,300 recordings, some taken inside the shock wave by a chase plane, the SSBD demonstrated a reduction in boom by about one-third.  Several of the flights included NASA Dryden's [[F-15 Eagle|F-15B]] research testbed aircraft following to measure the F-5E's shock wave signature close-up. During the flights, many shock wave patterns were measured by the F-15B at various distances and orientations from the F-5E.

An unmodified F-5E flew a few seconds behind the demonstration aircraft to provide a baseline sonic boom measurement to validate the reduced boom produced by the demonstrator.

A [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School]] [[LET L-23|Blanik L-23]] [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]] carrying a microphone on the left wingtip, and a pressure transducer on the side of the fuselage, flew at a lower altitude of {{convert|10,000|ft}} under the path of the F-5E, which flew at {{convert|32,000 |ft}}, to record sonic booms in the air. In addition, sonic boom data were gathered on the ground by an array of 42 sensors and recording devices along 2.5 miles under the flight path of the F-5E. Dryden-developed boom amplitude and direction sensors recorded ground-level sonic boom signature data.

The demonstration was initially part of the Quiet Supersonic Platform program funded by [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA). Subsequently, the vehicle systems division of NASA's Office of Aeronautics funded the project. Northrop-Grumman Corporation's Integrated Systems Sector in [[El Segundo, California]], modified the [[U.S. Navy]] F-5E aircraft into the SSBD aircraft. The aircraft is preserved on display in the [[Valiant Air Command Warbird Museum]] at [[Titusville, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vacwarbirds.org/AirplaneGallery/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212002603/http://www.vacwarbirds.org/AirplaneGallery/index.html |archivedate=2012-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solardome Industries Limited''' (shortened to Solardome) is a UK manufacturer of glass [[Geodesic_dome|geodesic domes]]. 

The original [[greenhouse]] was an offshoot of the 1960s [[NATO]] developed early warning radar system. The [[Buckminster Fuller]] organisation designed and develop giant "golf ball" radar domes. In Europe these were placed in [[RAF Fylingdales|Fylingdales]], North Yorkshire.

These giant domes had to withstand extremes of wind and storm and yet remain unaffected. An ex German [[U-boat]] engineer, Hans Lemke,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/advice/propertymarket/3307021/The-eden-effect.html|title=The eden effect|last=Stock|first=Jon|date=25 September 2002|work=|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-10-17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; living in [[Hunmanby]] North Yorkshire was fascinated by these domes and thought, "If they can withstand these weather conditions then they would make an ideal domestic garden building, greenhouse or garden conservatory". He explored the Buckminster Fuller Geodesic domes and their principles and then designed and manufactured the first European domestic [[Geodesic dome]], a 14' 6" Solardome.

The first glasshouse was produced in 1969 and production continues to this day,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.solardome.co.uk|title=Experts in aluminium geodesic domes - Solardome Industries|website=Solardome Industries|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; although not in Hunmanby.

==Media==
In 2012 a Solardome glasshouse was included as part of a project to improve facilities at The Yard, as featured on the [[BBC One]] "Big Build Children in Need Special" programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01ny39r|title=The Big Build Children in Need Special - Edinburgh|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Space colonization''' (also called '''space settlement''', or '''extraterrestrial colonization''') is permanent human habitation off the planet [[Earth]].

Many arguments have been made for and against space colonization.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://www.thespaceshow.com The Space Show], an online radio program, has had on average 16 shows per month going back to 2001, many of which discuss space settlement.&lt;/ref&gt; The two most common in favor of colonization are survival of human [[civilization]] and the [[biosphere]] in the event of a [[Global catastrophic risk|planetary-scale disaster (natural or man-made)]], and the availability of additional resources in space that could enable expansion of human society. The most common objections to colonization include concerns that the [[commodification]] of the cosmos may be likely to enhance the interests of the already powerful, including major economic and military institutions, and to exacerbate pre-existing detrimental processes such as [[war]]s, [[economic inequality]], and [[environmental degradation]].&lt;ref name=Dickens-MR-2010-11&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Dickens| first1=Peter|last2=Ormrod|first2=James| url=http://monthlyreview.org/2010/11/01/the-humanization-of-the-cosmos-to-what-end/ |title=The Humanization of the Cosmos - to What End?|date=Nov 2010|publisher=[[Monthly Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dickens-MR-2008-02&gt;Dickens, Peter (Feb 2008).  [http://monthlyreview.org/2008/02/01/who-really-won-the-space-race/ Who Really Won the Space Race?], ''[[Monthly Review]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dickens-MR-2017-03&gt;Dickens, Peter (March 2017).  [https://monthlyreview.org/2017/03/01/astronauts-at-work/ Astronauts at Work: The Social Relations of Space Travel], ''[[Monthly Review]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

No space colonies have been built so far. Currently, the building of a space colony would present a set of huge technological and economic challenges. Space settlements would have to provide for nearly all (or all) the material needs of hundreds or thousands of humans, in an environment out in space that is [[Effect of spaceflight on the human body|very hostile]] to human life. They would involve technologies, such as [[controlled ecological life support system]]s, that have yet to be developed in any meaningful way. They would also have to deal with the as-yet unknown issue of how humans would behave and thrive in such places long-term. Because of the present cost of sending anything from the surface of the Earth into orbit (around $2,500 per-pound to orbit, expected to further decrease),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/space/is-spacex-changing-the-rocket-equation-132285884/?no-ist|title=Is SpaceX Changing the Rocket Equation?|author=Andrew Chaikin|work=Air &amp; Space Magazine|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a space colony would currently be a massively expensive project.

There are yet no plans for building space colonies by any large-scale organization, either government or private. However, many proposals, speculations, and designs for space settlements have been made through the years, and a considerable number of space colonization [[space advocacy|advocates]] and groups are active. Several famous scientists, such as [[Freeman Dyson]], have come out in favor of space settlement.&lt;ref name=dyson&gt;{{cite web |author=Britt, Robert Roy |date=8 October 2001 |title=Archived copy |website=space.com |url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/colonize_why_011008-1.html |accessdate=2006-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125083046/http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/colonize_why_011008-1.html |archivedate=25 November 2010 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the technological front, there is ongoing progress in making access to space cheaper ([[reusable launch system]]s could reach $10 per-pound to orbit),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a7446/elon-musk-on-spacexs-reusable-rocket-plans-6653023/|title=Elon Musk on SpaceX's Reusable Rocket Plans|date=7 February 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in creating [[Space manufacturing|automated manufacturing and construction techniques]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Anthony|first=Sebastian |title=Space giants join forces to battle SpaceX: This is how cheap space travel begins |url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/184434-space-giants-join-forces-to-battle-spacex-this-is-how-cheap-space-travel-begins |accessdate=2014-10-10 |newspaper=NASAspaceflight.com |date=2014-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons==

===Survival of human civilization===
{{Main|Space and survival}}

The primary argument calling for space colonization is the long-term survival of human civilization. By developing alternative locations off Earth, the planet's species, including humans, could live on in the event of [[Global catastrophic risk|natural or man-made disasters on our own planet]].

On two occasions, theoretical physicist and cosmologist [[Stephen Hawking]] has argued for space colonization as a means of saving humanity. In 2001, Hawking predicted that the human race would become extinct within the next thousand years, unless colonies could be established in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Highfield |first=Roger |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1359562/Colonies-in-space-may-be-only-hope-says-Hawking.html |title=Colonies in space may be only hope, says Hawking |work=The Telegraph |date=16 October 2001 |accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he stated that humanity faces two options: either we colonize space within the next two hundred years and build residential units on other planets, or we will face the prospect of [[Human extinction|long-term extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;"Mankind must colonize other planets to survive, says Hawking". Daily Mail(London). 2006-12-01. Retrieved March 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, then [[NASA]] Administrator [[Michael D. Griffin|Michael Griffin]] identified space colonization as the ultimate goal of current spaceflight programs, saying:
{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;the goal isn't just scientific exploration&amp;nbsp;... it's also about extending the range of human habitat out from Earth into the solar system as we go forward in time&amp;nbsp;... In the long run a single-planet species will not survive&amp;nbsp;... If we humans want to survive for hundreds of thousands or millions of years, we must ultimately populate other planets. Now, today the technology is such that this is barely conceivable. We're in the infancy of it.&amp;nbsp;... I'm talking about that one day, I don't know when that day is, but there will be more human beings who live off the Earth than on it. We may well have people living on the Moon. We may have people living on the moons of Jupiter and other planets. We may have people making habitats on asteroids&amp;nbsp;... I know that humans will colonize the solar system and one day go beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/23/AR2005092301691.html| title=NASA's Griffin: 'Humans Will Colonize the Solar System'|date=September 25, 2005| publisher=Washington Post| pages=B07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Louis J. Halle]], formerly of the [[United States Department of State]], wrote in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' (Summer 1980) that the colonization of space will protect humanity in the event of global [[nuclear warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19800601faessay8146/louis-j-halle/a-hopeful-future-for-mankind.html| title=A Hopeful Future for Mankind| first=Louis J.| last=Halle| journal=Foreign Affairs| date=Summer 1980| doi=10.2307/20040585| volume=58| issue=5| pages=1129| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041013051342/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19800601faessay8146/louis-j-halle/a-hopeful-future-for-mankind.html| archivedate=2004-10-13| df=| jstor=20040585}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physicist [[Paul Davies]] also supports the view that if a planetary catastrophe threatens the survival of the human species on Earth, a self-sufficient colony could "reverse-colonize" Earth and restore [[Civilization|human civilization]]. The author and journalist [[William E. Burrows]] and the biochemist [[Robert Shapiro (chemist)|Robert Shapiro]] proposed a private project, the [[Alliance to Rescue Civilization]], with the goal of establishing an off-Earth "[[backup]]" of human civilization.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/01/science/01arc.html | title = Life After Earth: Imagining Survival Beyond This Terra Firma | publisher = New York Times | first=Richard | last=Morgan | date=2006-08-01 | accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on his [[Copernican principle]], [[J. Richard Gott]] has estimated that the human race could survive for another 7.8 million years, but it is not likely to ever colonize other planets. However, he expressed a hope to be proven wrong, because "colonizing other worlds is our best chance to hedge our bets and improve the survival prospects of our species".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Tierney |first=John |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/17/science/17tier.html?ex=1342324800&amp;en=ccf375ae9f268470&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss |title=A Survival Imperative for Space Colonization |date=July 17, 2007 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vast resources in space===
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space }}
Resources in space, both in materials and energy, are enormous. The [[Solar System]] alone has, according to different estimates, enough material and energy to support anywhere from several thousand to over a billion times that of the current Earth-based human population.&lt;ref&gt;Estimated 3000 times the land area of Earth. O'Neill, Gerard K. (1976, 2000). ''[[The High Frontier]]''. Apogee Books {{ISBN|1-896522-67-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Estimated 10 quadrillion (10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;) people. Lewis, John S. (1997). ''[[Mining the Sky|Mining the Sky: Untold Riches from the Asteroids, Comets, and Planets]].'' Helix Books/Addison-Wesley. {{ISBN|0-201-32819-4}} version 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Estimated 5 quintillion (5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;) people. Savage, Marshall (1992, 1994). ''[[The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps]].'' Little, Brown. {{ISBN|0-316-77163-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the Solar System, several hundred billion other stars in the [[observable universe]] provide opportunities for both colonization and resource collection, though travel to any of them is impossible on any practical time-scale without [[interstellar travel]] by use of [[generation ship]]s or revolutionary new methods of travel, such as [[faster-than-light]] (FTL).

Asteroid mining will also be a key player in space colonization. Water and materials to make structures and shielding can be easily found in asteroids.

===Expansion with fewer negative consequences===
{{Further|Holocene extinction}}

Expansion of humans and technological progress has usually resulted in some form of environmental devastation, and destruction of [[ecosystem]]s and their accompanying [[wildlife]]. In the past, expansion has often come at the expense of displacing many [[indigenous peoples]], the resulting treatment of these peoples ranging anywhere from encroachment to genocide. Because space has no known life, this need not be a consequence, as some space settlement advocates have pointed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.space-settlement-institute.org/meaning.html| title=The Meaning of Space Settlement| publisher = Space Settlement Institute| accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Marshall (1992, 1994).

===Alleviating overpopulation and resource demand===
{{See also|Human overpopulation #Extraterrestrial settlement}}
Another argument for space colonization is to mitigate the negative effects of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1976-01-01|title=The impact of space colonization on world dynamics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040162576900196|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=361–399|doi=10.1016/0040-1625(76)90019-6|issn=0040-1625}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2016}}&lt;!-- Is this to mitigate "negative effects" for some group of persons who settle off Earth, or to generally mitigate a perceived overpopulation problem on Earth? Looking for sources on the latter argument, if it is being made. --&gt;
If the resources of space were opened to use and viable life-supporting habitats were built, Earth would no longer define the limitations of growth. Although many of Earth's resources are non-renewable, off-planet colonies could satisfy the majority of the planet's resource requirements. With the availability of extraterrestrial resources, demand on terrestrial ones would decline.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, ''Colonies in Space''; Pournelle, ''A Step Farther Out''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other arguments===
Additional goals cite the innate human drive to explore and discover, a quality recognized at the core of progress and thriving civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Clarke, Arthur C. |title= Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry Into the Limits of the Possible |year= 1962 |chapter= Rocket to the Renaissance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.spacedaily.com/news/oped-03y.html | title= The Space Settlement Summit | author= McKnight, John Carter | publisher= Space Daily | date= 20 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nick Bostrom]] has argued that from a [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] perspective, space colonization should be a chief goal as it would enable a very large population to live for a very long period of time (possibly billions of years), which would produce an enormous amount of utility (or happiness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html |title= Astronomical Waste: The Opportunity Cost of Delayed Technological Development |journal= Utilitas |volume= 15 |number= 3 |date= November 2003 |pages= 308–314 |publisher= Cambridge University Press | doi= 10.1017/S0953820800004076|last1= Bostrom |first1= Nick }}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that it is more important to reduce existential risks to increase the probability of eventual colonization than to accelerate technological development so that space colonization could happen sooner. In his paper, he assumes that the created lives will have positive ethical value despite the problem of [[suffering]].

In a 2001 interview with Freeman Dyson, J.&amp;nbsp;Richard Gott and Sid Goldstein, they were asked for reasons why some humans should live in space.&lt;ref name=dyson /&gt; Their answers were:
* Spread life and beauty throughout the universe
* Ensure the survival of our species
* Make money through new forms of [[Commercialization of space|space commercialization]] such as [[space-based solar power|solar-power satellites]], [[asteroid mining]], and [[space manufacturing]]
* Save the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] of Earth by moving people and industry into space

==Goals==

Although some items of the infrastructure requirements above can already be easily produced on Earth and would therefore not be very valuable as trade items (oxygen, water, base metal ores, silicates, etc.), other high value items are more abundant, more easily produced, of higher quality, or can only be produced in space. These would provide (over the long-term) a very high return on the initial investment in space infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacefuture.com/archive/the_technical_and_economic_feasibility_of_mining_the_near_earth_asteriods.shtml The Technical and Economic Feasibility of Mining the Near-Earth Asteroids] Presented at 49th IAF Congress, Sept 28 - Oct 2, 1998, Melbourne, Australia by Mark J Sonter&amp;nbsp;— Space Future&lt;/ref&gt;

The mining and extraction of metals from a small asteroid the size of [[3554 Amun]] or [[(6178) 1986 DA]], both small near-Earth asteroids, would be 30 times as much metal as humans have mined throughout history. A metal asteroid this size would be worth approximately US$20 trillion at 2001 market prices.

Space colonization is seen as a long-term goal of some national [[space program]]s. Since the advent of the 21st-century commercialization of space, which saw greater cooperation between NASA and the private sector, several private companies have announced plans toward the [[colonization of Mars]]. Among entrepreneurs leading the call for space colonization are [[Elon Musk]], [[Dennis Tito]] and [[Bas Lansdorp]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4729211/Billionaire-PayPal-founder-announces-Mars-city-bid.html Billionaire PayPal founder announces dramatic Mars city bid], by Jack Losh; The Sun, January 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/09/business/global/reality-tv-for-the-red-planet.html Reality TV for the Red Planet], by Nicola Clark; The New York Times, March 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/02/130222-manned-mission-mars-tito-space-science/ Businessman Dennis Tito Financing Manned Mission to Mars], by Jane J.

Building colonies in space would require access to water, food, space, people, construction materials, energy, transportation, [[communication]]s, [[life support system|life support]], [[simulated gravity]], [[radiation]] protection and capital investment. It is likely the colonies would be located near the necessary physical resources.

===Materials===
{{Further|Asteroid mining}}

Colonies on the Moon, Mars, or asteroids could extract local materials. The Moon is deficient in [[volatiles]] such as [[argon]], [[helium]] and compounds of [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]] and [[nitrogen]]. The LCROSS impacter was targeted at the Cabeus crater which was chosen as having a high concentration of water for the Moon. A plume of material erupted in which some water was detected. Mission chief scientist Anthony Colaprete estimated that the Cabeus crater contains material with 1% water or possibly more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/NASA-s-moon-blast-called-a-smashing-success-3213973.php | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=David | last=Perlman | title=NASA's moon blast called a smashing success | date=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water [[ice]] should also be in other permanently shadowed craters near the lunar poles. Although helium is present only in low concentrations on the Moon, where it is deposited into [[regolith]] by the solar wind, an estimated million tons of He-3 exists over all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satnews.com/stories2007/4588/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308151604/http://www.satnews.com/stories2007/4588/ |date=March 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has industrially significant [[oxygen]], [[silicon]], and metals such as [[iron]], [[aluminum]], and [[titanium]].

Launching materials from Earth is expensive, so bulk materials for colonies could come from the Moon, a [[near-Earth object]] (NEO), [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]], or [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]. The benefits of using such sources include: a lower gravitational force, no [[Drag (physics)|atmospheric drag]] on cargo vessels, and no biosphere to damage. Many NEOs contain substantial amounts of metals. Underneath a drier outer crust (much like [[oil shale]]), some other NEOs are inactive comets which include billions of tons of water ice and [[kerogen]] hydrocarbons, as well as some nitrogen compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1061/40177(207)107 |title=Discovery of Abundant, Accessible Hydrocarbons nearly Everywhere in the Solar System |last1= Zuppero|first1= Anthony |year= 1996 |publisher= [[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] |booktitle= Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Space '96 |doi= 10.1061/40177(207)107|isbn= 0-7844-0177-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farther out, [[Colonization of the outer Solar System#Trojan asteroids|Jupiter's Trojan asteroids]] are thought to be rich in water ice and other volatiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Sanders|first=Robert|title=Binary asteroid in Jupiter's orbit may be icy comet from solar system's infancy|date=1 February 2006|publisher=UC Berkeley|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/02/01_patroclus.shtml|accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Recycling]] of some raw materials would almost certainly be necessary.

===Energy===
[[Solar energy]] in orbit is abundant, reliable, and is commonly used to power satellites today. There is no night in free space, and no clouds or atmosphere to block sunlight. Light intensity obeys an [[inverse-square law]]. So the solar energy available at distance ''d'' from the Sun is ''E'' = 1367/''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''d'' is measured in [[astronomical unit]]s (AU) and 1367 watts/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the energy available at the distance of Earth's orbit from the Sun, 1 AU.&lt;ref&gt;McGRAW-HILL ENCYCLOPEDIA OF Science &amp; Technology, 8th Edition (c)1997; vol. 16 page 654&lt;/ref&gt;

In the weightlessness and vacuum of space, high temperatures for industrial processes can easily be achieved in [[solar ovens]] with huge parabolic reflectors made of metallic foil with very lightweight support structures. Flat mirrors to reflect sunlight around radiation shields into living areas (to avoid line-of-sight access for cosmic rays, or to make the Sun's image appear to move across their "sky") or onto crops are even lighter and easier to build.

Large solar power photovoltaic cell arrays or thermal power plants would be needed to meet the electrical power needs of the settlers' use. In developed parts of Earth, electrical consumption can average 1 kilowatt/person (or roughly 10 [[watt-hour|megawatt-hours]] per person per year.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unescap.org/esd/energy/information/ElectricPower/1999-2000/access.htm UNESCAP Electric Power in Asia and the Pacific] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213083253/http://www.unescap.org/esd/energy/information/ElectricPower/1999-2000/access.htm |date=February 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These power plants could be at a short distance from the main structures if wires are used to transmit the power, or much farther away with [[wireless power transmission]].

A major export of the initial space settlement designs was anticipated to be large [[solar power satellite]]s that would use wireless power transmission (phase-locked [[microwave]] beams or lasers emitting wavelengths that special solar cells convert with high efficiency) to send power to locations on Earth, or to colonies on the Moon or other locations in space. For locations on Earth, this method of getting power is extremely benign, with zero emissions and far less ground area required per watt than for conventional solar panels. Once these satellites are primarily built from lunar or asteroid-derived materials, the price of SPS electricity could be lower than energy from fossil fuel or nuclear energy; replacing these would have significant benefits such as the elimination of [[greenhouse gases]] and [[nuclear waste]] from electricity generation.

Transmitting solar energy wirelessly from the Earth to the Moon and back is also an idea proposed for the benefit of space colonization and energy resources. Physicist Dr. David Criswell, who worked for NASA during the Apollo missions, came up with the idea of using power beams to transfer energy from space. These beams, microwaves with a wavelength of about 12&amp;nbsp;cm, will be almost untouched as they travel through the atmosphere. They can also be aimed at more industrial areas to keep away from humans or animal activities.&lt;ref name="i2massociates.com"&gt;[http://www.i2massociates.com/downloads/AAPG_Memoir_101-July18-2012.pdf Nuclear Power and Associated Environmental Issues in the Transition of Exploration and Mining on Earth to the Development of Off-World Natural Resources in the 21st Century]&lt;/ref&gt; This will allow for safer and more reliable methods of transferring solar energy.

In 2008, scientists were able to send a 20 watt microwave signal from a mountain in Maui to the island of Hawaii. Since then [[JAXA]] and Mitsubishi has teamed up on a $21 billion project in order to place satellites in orbit which could generate up to 1 gigawatt of energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-06/satellites-could-gather-energy-sun-and-beam-it-down-earth Space Based Solar Power],&lt;!--Author?--&gt; ''Popular Science'', June 2, 2011.{{page needed|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the next advancements being done today in order to make energy be transmitted wirelessly for space-based solar energy.

However, the value of SPS power delivered wirelessly to other locations in space will typically be far higher than to Earth. Otherwise, the means of generating the power would need to be included with these projects and pay the heavy penalty of Earth launch costs. Therefore, other than proposed demonstration projects for power delivered to Earth,&lt;ref name="NatSecSpaceOffice2007"/&gt; the first priority for SPS electricity is likely to be locations in space, such as communications satellites, fuel depots or "orbital tugboat" boosters transferring cargo and passengers between [[low-Earth orbit]] (LEO) and other orbits such as [[geosynchronous orbit]] (GEO), [[lunar orbit]] or [[highly-eccentric Earth orbit]] (HEEO).&lt;ref name="Lewis1997"&gt;[[Mining the Sky]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|132}} The system will also rely on satellites and receiving stations on Earth to convert the energy into electricity. Because of this energy can be transmitted easily from dayside to nightside meaning power is reliable 24/7.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/article/moon-solar-energy-power Beaming solar energy from the Moon could solve Earth's energy crisis]; March 29, 2017; WIRED]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nuclear power]] is sometimes proposed for colonies located on the Moon or on Mars, as the supply of solar energy is too discontinuous in these locations; the Moon has nights of two Earth weeks in duration. Mars has nights, relatively high gravity, and an atmosphere featuring [[Climate of Mars#Effect of dust storms|large dust storms]] to cover and degrade solar panels. Also, Mars' greater distance from the Sun (1.5 astronomical units, AU) translates into ''E/(1.5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.25)'' only ½-⅔ the solar energy of Earth orbit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091004020806.htm 'Trash Can' Nuclear Reactors Could Power Human Outpost On Moon Or Mars]; October 4, 2009; ScienceDaily&lt;/ref&gt; Another method would be transmitting energy wirelessly to the lunar or Martian colonies from solar power satellites (SPSs) as described above; the difficulties of generating power in these locations make the relative advantages of SPSs much greater there than for power beamed to locations on Earth. In order to also be able to fulfill the requirements of a moon base and energy to supply life support, maintenance, communications, and research, a combination of both nuclear and solar energy will be used in the first colonies.&lt;ref name="i2massociates.com"/&gt;

For both solar thermal and nuclear power generation in airless environments, such as the Moon and space, and to a lesser extent the very thin Martian atmosphere, one of the main difficulties is dispersing the [[Carnot cycle|inevitable heat generated]]. This requires fairly large radiator areas.

===Life support===
{{Further|Effect of spaceflight on the human body|Space medicine|Space food}}

In space settlements, a life support system must recycle or import all the nutrients without "crashing." The closest terrestrial analogue to space life support is possibly that of a [[nuclear submarine]]. Nuclear submarines use mechanical life support systems to support humans for months without surfacing, and this same basic technology could presumably be employed for space use. However, nuclear submarines run "open loop"—extracting oxygen from seawater, and typically dumping [[carbon dioxide]] overboard, although they recycle existing oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airitilibrary.com.libproxy1.usc.edu/Publication/alDetailedMesh?DocID=P20100106003-200911-201004190023-201004190023-1642-1650|title=A Novel Application of the SAWD-Sabatier-SPE Integrated System for CO2 Removal and O2 Regeneration in Submarine Cabins during Prolonged Voyages|last=Huang|first=Zhi|date=|website=Airiti Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recycling of the carbon dioxide has been approached in the literature using the [[Sabatier process]] or the [[Bosch reaction]].

Although a fully mechanistic life support system is conceivable, a [[closed ecological system]] is generally proposed for life support. The [[Biosphere 2]] project in Arizona has shown that a complex, small, enclosed, man-made biosphere can support eight people for at least a year, although there were many problems. A year or so into the two-year mission oxygen had to be replenished, which strongly suggests that they achieved atmospheric closure.

The relationship between organisms, their habitat and the non-Earth environment can be:
* Organisms and their habitat fully isolated from the environment (examples include artificial [[biosphere]], Biosphere 2, [[life support system]])
* Changing the environment to become a life-friendly habitat, a process called [[terraforming]]
* Changing organisms to become more compatible with the environment (see [[genetic engineering]], [[transhumanism]], [[cyborg]])

A combination of the above technologies is also possible.

===Radiation protection===
{{see also|Health threat from cosmic rays}}

[[Cosmic rays]] and [[solar flare]]s create a lethal radiation environment in space. In Earth orbit, the [[Van Allen belts]] make living above the Earth's atmosphere difficult. To protect life, settlements must be surrounded by sufficient mass to absorb most incoming radiation, unless magnetic or plasma radiation shields were developed.&lt;ref name = spacecraftshielding&gt;[http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~simon_g_shepherd/research/Shielding/ Spacecraft Shielding] engineering.dartmouth.edu. Retrieved 3 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Passive mass shielding of four metric tons per square meter of surface area will reduce radiation dosage to several [[Sievert#Yearly dose examples|mSv]] or less annually, well below the rate of some populated [[Background radiation#Natural background radiation|high natural background areas]] on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;NASA SP-413 [http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/75SummerStudy/5appendE.html Space Settlements: A Design Study. Appendix E Mass Shielding] Retrieved 3 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be leftover material (slag) from processing lunar soil and asteroids into oxygen, metals, and other useful materials. However, it represents a significant obstacle to maneuvering vessels with such massive bulk (mobile spacecraft being particularly likely to use less massive active shielding).&lt;ref name = spacecraftshielding/&gt; Inertia would necessitate powerful thrusters to start or stop rotation, or electric motors to spin two massive portions of a vessel in opposite senses. Shielding material can be stationary around a rotating interior.

===Self-replication===
{{see also|von Neumann probe|clanking replicator|molecular nanotechnology}}

[[Space manufacturing]] could enable self-replication. Some think it's the ultimate goal because it allows an [[exponential growth|exponential]] increase in colonies, while eliminating costs to and dependence on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Crawford, "Where are they?," ''Scientific American'' 283, no. 1 (2000 July): 38.&lt;/ref&gt; It could be argued that the establishment of such a colony would be Earth's first act of [[self-replication]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Margulis and Ricardo Guerrero, "Life as a planetary phenomenon: the colonization of Mars," ''Microbiología'' 11 (1995): 173-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Intermediate goals include colonies that expect only information from Earth (science, engineering, entertainment) and colonies that just require periodic supply of light weight objects, such as [[integrated circuit]]s, medicines, [[DNA|genetic material]] and tools.

===Psychological adjustment===
The monotony and loneliness that comes from a prolonged space mission can leave astronauts susceptible to cabin fever or having a psychotic break. Moreover, lack of sleep, fatigue, and work overload can affect an astronaut's ability to perform well in an environment such as space where every action is critical.&lt;ref&gt;Clynes, Manfred E. and Nathan S. Kline, (1960) "Cyborgs and Space," Astronautics, September, pp.&amp;nbsp;26–27 and 74-76;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population size===
In 2002, the [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[John H. Moore]] [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn1936-magic-number-for-space-pioneers-calculated. estimated] that a population of 150–180 would permit a stable society to exist for 60 to 80 generations&amp;nbsp;— equivalent to 2000 years.

A much smaller initial population of as little as two women should be viable as long as human [[embryo]]s are available from Earth. Use of a [[sperm bank]] from Earth also allows a smaller starting base with negligible [[inbreeding]].

Researchers in conservation biology have tended to adopt the "50/500" rule of thumb initially advanced by Franklin and Soule. This rule says a short-term [[effective population size]] (''N''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) of 50 is needed to prevent an unacceptable rate of [[breed|inbreeding]], whereas a long‐term ''N''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; of 500 is required to maintain overall genetic variability. The ''N''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;50 prescription corresponds to an inbreeding rate of 1% per generation, approximately half the maximum rate tolerated by domestic animal breeders. The ''N''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;500 value attempts to balance the rate of gain in genetic variation due to mutation with the rate of loss due to [[genetic drift]].

Assuming a journey of 6,300 years, the astrophysicist Frédéric Marin and the particle physicist Camille Beluffi calculated that the minimum viable population for a [[generation ship]] to reach [[Proxima Centauri]] would be 98 settlers at the beginning of the mission (then the crew will breed until reaching a stable population of several hundred settlers within the ship) .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1806.03856|last1=Marin|first1=F|title=Computing the minimal crew for a multi-generational space travel towards Proxima Centauri b|last2=Beluffi|first2=C|class=astro-ph.IM|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611485/this-is-how-many-people-wed-have-to-send-to-proxima-centauri-to-make-sure-someone-actually/amp/ |publisher=''[[MIT Technology Review]]'' |title=This is how many people we’d have to send to Proxima Centauri to make sure someone actually arrives |date=June 22, 2018 |quote=“We can then conclude that, under the parameters used for those simulations, a minimum crew of 98 settlers is needed for a 6,300-year multi-generational space journey towards Proxima Centauri b,” say Marin and Beluffi.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[File:Mars mission.jpg|thumb|Artist Les Bossinas' 1989 concept of [[Manned mission to Mars|Mars mission]]]]
Location is a frequent point of contention between space colonization advocates. The location of colonization can be on a physical body [[planet]], [[dwarf planet]], [[natural satellite]], or [[asteroid]] or orbiting one. For colonies not on a body see also [[space habitat]].

===Near-Earth space===

====The Moon====
{{Main|Colonization of the Moon}}
Due to its proximity and familiarity, Earth's Moon is discussed as a target for colonization. It has the benefits of proximity to Earth and lower [[escape velocity]], allowing for easier exchange of goods and services. A drawback of the Moon is its low abundance of volatiles necessary for life such as hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon. Water-ice deposits that exist in some polar [[Impact crater|craters]] could serve as a source for these elements. An alternative solution is to bring hydrogen from near-Earth asteroids and combine it with oxygen extracted from lunar rock.

The Moon's low surface gravity is also a concern, as it is unknown whether 1/6[[g-force|g]] is enough to maintain human health for long periods.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} &lt;!--add, or link to, something about zero-gee bone decay and the like--&gt;

The Moon's lack of atmosphere provides no protection from space radiation or meteoroids. The early Moon colonies may shelter in ancient [[Lunar lava tube]]s to gain protection. The two-week day/night cycle makes use of solar power more difficult.

====Lagrange points====
{{Main|Lagrange point colonization}}
[[File:Lagrange points.jpg|thumb|A contour plot of the [[gravitational potential]] of the [[Sun]] and [[Earth]], showing the five Earth–Sun Lagrange points]]

Another near-Earth possibility are the five Earth–Moon [[Lagrangian point|Lagrange points]]. Although they would generally also take a few days to reach with current technology, many of these points would have near-continuous solar power because their distance from Earth would result in only brief and infrequent eclipses of light from the Sun. However, the fact that the  Earth–Moon Lagrange points {{L4}} and {{L5}} tend to collect dust and debris, whereas {{L1}}-{{L3}} require active [[orbital stationkeeping|station-keeping]] measures to maintain a stable position, make them somewhat less suitable places for habitation than was originally believed. Additionally, the orbit of {{L2}}–{{L5}} takes them out of the protection of the Earth's [[magnetosphere]] for approximately two-thirds of the time, exposing them to the health threat from cosmic rays.

The five Earth–Sun Lagrange points would totally eliminate eclipses, but only {{L1}} and {{L2}} would be reachable in a few days' time. The other three Earth–Sun points would require months to reach.

===Other micro-g orbits===
See [[space habitat]]

===The inner planets===

====Mercury====
{{expand section|date=August 2018}}
{{specific|section|date=August 2018}}
Colonizing Mercury would involve similar challenges as the Moon as there are few volatile elements, no atmosphere and the surface gravity is lower than Earth's. However, the planet also receives almost seven times the solar flux as the Earth/Moon system.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Geologist Stephen Gillett suggested in 1996 that this could make Mercury an ideal place to build and launch [[solar sail]] spacecraft, which could launch as folded up "chunks" by [[mass driver]] from Mercury's surface.  Once in space the solar sails would deploy. Since Mercury's [[solar constant]] is 6.5 times higher than Earth's, energy for the mass driver should be easy to come by, and solar sails near Mercury would have 6.5 times the thrust they do near Earth. This could make Mercury an ideal place to acquire materials useful in building hardware to send to (and terraform) Venus. Vast solar collectors could also be built on or near Mercury to produce power for large scale engineering activities such as laser-pushed lightsails to nearby star systems.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Schmidt and [[Robert Zubrin]], eds., "Islands in the Sky: Bold New Ideas for Colonizing Space"; Wiley, 1996, p. 71-84&lt;/ref&gt;

====Venus====
{{Main|Colonization of Venus}}
[[File:TerraformedVenus.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's impression of a terraformed Venus]]

====Mars====
{{Main|Colonization of Mars}}

===Asteroid belt===
{{Main|Colonization of the asteroids}}
{{See also|Asteroids#Exploration}}

Colonization of asteroids would require space habitats. The [[asteroid belt]] has significant overall material available, the largest object being [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], although it is thinly distributed as it covers a vast region of space. Unmanned supply craft should be practical with little technological advance, even crossing 500 million kilometers of space. The colonists would have a strong interest in assuring their asteroid did not hit Earth or any other body of significant mass, but would have extreme difficulty in moving an asteroid{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} of any size. The orbits of the Earth and most asteroids are very distant from each other in terms of delta-v and the asteroidal bodies have enormous [[momentum]]. Rockets or mass drivers can perhaps be installed on asteroids to direct their path into a safe course.

===Moons of outer planets===

====Jovian moons&amp;nbsp;– Europa, Callisto and Ganymede====
{{Main|Colonization of Europa|Colonization of the outer Solar System}}

The [[Artemis Project]] designed a plan to colonize [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], one of [[Jupiter]]'s moons. Scientists were to inhabit [[igloo]]s and drill down into the Europan ice crust, exploring any sub-surface ocean. This plan discusses possible use of "air pockets" for human habitation. Europa is considered one of the more habitable bodies in the Solar System and so merits investigation as a possible abode for life.

NASA performed a study called ''HOPE'' (Revolutionary Concepts for '''H'''uman '''O'''uter '''P'''lanet '''E'''xploration) regarding the future exploration of the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick A. Troutman (NASA Langley Research Center) et al., [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20030063128.pdf Revolutionary Concepts for Human Outer Planet Exploration (HOPE)], accessed May 10, 2006 (.doc format)&lt;/ref&gt; The target chosen was [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] due to its distance from Jupiter, and thus the planet's harmful radiation. It could be possible to build a surface base that would produce fuel for further exploration of the Solar System.

Three of the [[Galilean moons]] (Europa, Ganymede, Callisto) have an abundance of volatiles that may support colonization efforts.

====Moons of Saturn&amp;nbsp;– Titan, Enceladus, and others====
{{Main|Colonization of Titan}}

[[Titan (moon)|Titan]] is suggested as a target for colonization,&lt;ref name="zoob2ttn"&gt;Robert Zubrin, ''Entering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization'', section: Titan, pp. 163–166, Tarcher/Putnam, 1999, {{ISBN|978-1-58542-036-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it is the only moon in the Solar System to have a dense atmosphere and is rich in carbon-bearing compounds. Titan has ice water and large methane oceans.&lt;ref name=NasaNews&gt;[https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/science/titan/] https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/science/titan/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Zubrin]] identified Titan as possessing an abundance of all the elements necessary to support life{{Where?|date=December 2016}}, making Titan perhaps the most advantageous locale in the outer Solar System for colonization, and saying "In certain ways, Titan is the most hospitable extraterrestrial world within our solar system for human colonization".

[[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] is a small, icy moon orbiting close to Saturn, notable for its extremely bright surface and the geyser-like plumes of ice and water vapor that erupt from its southern polar region. If Enceladus has liquid water, it joins Mars and Jupiter's moon Europa as one of the prime places in the Solar System to look for extraterrestrial life and possible future settlements.

Other large satellites: [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]], [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]], [[Dione (moon)|Dione]], [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]], and [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]], all have large quantities of volatiles, which can be used to support settlements.

===Trans-Neptunian region===
{{main|Colonization of trans-Neptunian objects}}

The [[Kuiper belt]] is estimated to have 70,000 bodies of 100&amp;nbsp;km or larger.

[[Freeman Dyson]] has suggested that within a few centuries human civilization will have relocated to the Kuiper belt.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, ''The Sun, The Genome, and The Internet'' (1999) Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513922-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oort cloud]] is estimated to have up to a trillion comets.

===Outside the Solar System===
[[File:LH 95.jpg|thumb|right|A [[star]] forming region in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]]]
Looking beyond the Solar System, there are up to several hundred billion potential stars with possible colonization targets. The main difficulty is the vast distances to other stars: roughly a hundred thousand times further away than the planets in the Solar System. This means that some combination of very high speed (some percentage of the [[speed of light]]), or travel times lasting centuries or millennia, would be required. These speeds are far beyond what current [[spacecraft propulsion]] systems can provide.

Many scientific papers have been published about [[interstellar travel]]. Given sufficient travel time and engineering work, both unmanned and generational voyages seem possible, though representing a very considerable technological and economic challenge unlikely to be met for some time, particularly for manned probes.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Space colonization technology could in principle allow human expansion at high, but sub-relativistic speeds, substantially less than the speed of light, ''c''.&amp;nbsp; An interstellar colony ship would be similar to a space habitat, with the addition of major propulsion capabilities and independent energy generation.

Hypothetical [[starship]] concepts proposed both by scientists and in [[hard science fiction]] include:
* A [[generation ship]] would travel much slower than light, with consequent interstellar trip times of many decades or centuries. The crew would go through generations before the journey is complete, so that none of the initial crew would be expected to survive to arrive at the destination, assuming current human lifespans.
* A [[sleeper ship]], in which most or all of the crew spend the journey in some form of [[hibernation]] or [[suspended animation]], allowing some or all who undertake the journey to survive to the end.
* An [[embryo space colonization|embryo-carrying interstellar starship]] (EIS), much smaller than a generation ship or sleeper ship, transporting human [[embryo]]s or DNA in a frozen or dormant state to the destination. (Obvious biological and psychological problems in birthing, raising, and educating such voyagers, neglected here, may not be fundamental.)
* A [[nuclear fusion]] or [[nuclear fission|fission]] powered ship (e.g. [[ion drive]]) of some kind, achieving velocities of up to perhaps 10% ''c''&amp;nbsp; permitting one-way trips to nearby stars with durations comparable to a human lifetime.
* A [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]]-ship, a nuclear-powered concept proposed by [[Freeman Dyson]] which would use [[nuclear bomb|nuclear explosions]] to propel a starship. A special case of the preceding nuclear rocket concepts, with similar potential velocity capability, but possibly easier technology.
* [[Solar sail|Laser propulsion]] concepts, using some form of beaming of power from the Solar System might allow a [[solar sail|light-sail]] or other ship to reach high speeds, comparable to those theoretically attainable by the fusion-powered electric rocket, above. These methods would need some means, such as supplementary nuclear propulsion, to stop at the destination, but a hybrid (light-sail for acceleration, fusion-electric for deceleration) system might be possible.

The above concepts all appear limited to high, but still sub-relativistic speeds, due to fundamental energy and reaction mass considerations, and all would entail trip times which might be enabled by space colonization technology, permitting self-contained habitats with lifetimes of decades to centuries. Yet human interstellar expansion at average speeds of even 0.1% of ''c''&amp;nbsp; would permit settlement of the entire Galaxy in less than one half of a galactic rotation period of ~250,000,000 years, which is comparable to the timescale of other galactic processes. Thus, even if interstellar travel at near relativistic speeds is never feasible (which cannot be clearly determined at this time), the development of space colonization could allow human expansion beyond the Solar System without requiring technological advances that cannot yet be reasonably foreseen. This could greatly improve the chances for the survival of intelligent life over cosmic timescales, given the many natural and human-related hazards that have been widely noted.

If humanity does gain access to a large amount of energy, on the order of the mass-energy of entire planets, it may eventually become feasible to construct [[Alcubierre drive]]s. These are one of the few methods of superluminal travel which may be possible under current physics. However it is probable that such a device could never exist, due to the fundamental challenges posed. For more on this see [[Alcubierre drive#Difficulties|Difficulties of making and using an Alcubierre Drive]].

====Intergalactic travel====
{{Main article|Intergalactic travel}} 
Looking beyond the Milky Way, there are at least 2 trillion other galaxies in the observable universe. The distances between galaxies are on the order of a million times farther than those between the stars. Because of the speed of light limit on how fast any material objects can travel in space, intergalactic travel would either have to involve voyages lasting millions of years,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Armstrong and Anders Sandberg, "Eternity in six hours: Intergalactic spreading of intelligent life and sharpening the Fermi paradox," ''Acta Astronautica'' 89 (2013): 1–13.&lt;/ref&gt; or a possible faster than light propulsion method based on speculative physics, such as the [[Alcubierre drive]]. There are, however, no scientific reasons for stating that [[intergalactic travel]] is impossible in principle.

==Funding==
Space colonization can roughly be said to be possible when the necessary methods of space colonization become [[Economic behavior|cheap enough]] (such as space access by cheaper launch systems) to meet the cumulative funds that have been gathered for the purpose.

Although there are no immediate prospects for the large amounts of money required for space colonization to be available given traditional launch costs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/Basics/wwwwh.html Space Settlement Basics] by Al Globus, NASA Ames Research Center.

there is some prospect of a radical reduction to launch costs in the 2010s, which would consequently lessen the cost of any efforts in that direction.

The [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy]] suggested that an [[Inducement prize contest|inducement prize]] should be established, perhaps by government, for the achievement of space colonization, for example by offering the prize to the first organization to place humans on the Moon and sustain them for a fixed period before they return to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/60736main_M2M_report_small.pdf A Journey to Inspire, Innovate, and Discover] - Report of the [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy]], June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terrestrial analogues to space colonies==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
The most famous attempt to build an analogue to a self-sufficient colony is [[Biosphere 2]], which attempted to duplicate Earth's biosphere.

==History==
The first known work on space colonization was ''[[The Brick Moon]]'', a work of fiction published in 1869 by [[Edward Everett Hale]], about an inhabited artificial satellite.&lt;ref&gt;E. E. Hale. ''[[The Brick Moon]]''. Atlantic Monthly, Vol. 24, 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian schoolmaster and physicist [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] foresaw elements of the space community in his book ''Beyond Planet Earth'' written about 1900. Tsiolkovsky had his space travelers building greenhouses and raising crops in space.&lt;ref&gt;K. E. Tsiolkovsky. ''Beyond Planet Earth''. Trans. by Kenneth Syers. Oxford, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; Tsiolkovsky believed that going into space would help perfect human beings, leading to immortality and peace.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.informatics.org/museum/tsiol.html The life of Konstantin Eduardovitch Tsiolkovsky 1857–1935] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615044125/http://www.informatics.org/museum/tsiol.html |date=June 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have also written about space colonies as Lasswitz in 1897 and Bernal, Oberth, Von Pirquet and Noordung in the 1920s. [[Wernher von Braun]] contributed his ideas in a 1952 ''Colliers'' article. In the 1950s and 1960s, [[Dandridge M. Cole]]&lt;ref&gt;Dandridge M. Cole and Donald W. Cox ''Islands in Space.'' Chilton, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; published his ideas.

Another seminal book on the subject was the book ''The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space'' by [[Gerard K. O'Neill]]&lt;ref&gt;G. K. O'Neill. ''The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space''. Morrow, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1977 which was followed the same year by ''Colonies in Space '' by [[T. A. Heppenheimer]].&lt;ref&gt;T. A. Heppenheimer. ''Colonies in Space''.

Colonizing space would require massive amounts of financial, physical, and human capital devoted to research, development, production, and deployment. Earth's [[natural resource]]s do not increase to a noteworthy extent (which is in keeping with the "only one Earth" position of environmentalists). Thus, considerable efforts in colonizing places outside Earth would appear as a hazardous waste of the Earth's limited resources for an aim without a clear end.

The fundamental problem of public things, needed for survival, such as space programs, is the [[free rider problem]]. Convincing the public to fund such programs would require additional self-interest arguments: If the objective of space colonization is to provide a "backup" in case everyone on Earth is killed, then why should someone on Earth pay for something that is only useful after they are dead? This assumes that space colonization is not widely acknowledged as a sufficiently valuable social goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/economics/free-rider/|title=Free Rider - Overview, Examples of Free Rider Problem in Society|work=Corporate Finance Institute|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by fertility rate|birth rates]] of many developed countries, specifically [[spacefaring|spacefaring ones]], are at or below replacement rates, thus negating the need to use colonisation as a means of population control.&lt;ref name = tsr2009/&gt;

Other objections include concerns that the forthcoming colonization and [[commodification]] of the cosmos may be likely to enhance the interests of the already powerful, including major economic and military institutions e.g. the large financial institutions, the major aerospace companies and the [[military–industrial complex]], to lead to new [[war]]s, and to exacerbate pre-existing exploitation of [[Exploitation of labour|workers]] and [[Exploitation of natural resources|resources]], [[economic inequality]], [[poverty]], social [[Social division|division]] and [[Social exclusion|marginalization]], environmental degradation, and other detrimental processes or institutions.&lt;ref name=Dickens-MR-2010-11/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dickens-MR-2008-02/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dickens-MR-2017-03/&gt;

Additional concerns include creating a culture in which humans are no longer seen as human, but rather as material assets. The issues of [[human dignity]], [[morality]], [[philosophy]], [[culture]], [[bioethics]], and the threat of [[megalomaniac]] leaders in these new "societies" would all have to be addressed in order for space colonization to meet the [[psychology|psychological]] and [[Group (sociology)|social]] needs of people living in isolated colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/sociology.html Sociology and Space Development] B.J. Bluth, Sociology Department, California State University, Northridge, SPACE SOCIAL SCIENCE&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative or addendum for the future of the human race, many science fiction writers have focused on the realm of the 'inner-space', that is the computer-aided exploration of the [[human mind]] and human [[consciousness]]—possibly en route developmentally to a [[Matrioshka Brain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://curiosity.com/topics/a-matrioshka-brain-is-a-computer-the-size-of-a-solar-system-curiosity/|title=A Matrioshka Brain Is A Computer The Size Of A Solar System|website=curiosity.com|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Unmanned space mission|Robotic exploration]] is proposed as an alternative to gain many of the same scientific advantages without the limited mission duration and high cost of life support and return transportation involved in manned missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/report/robotic-planetary-exploration/|title=Robotic Exploration of the Solar System|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern is the potential to cause [[interplanetary contamination]] on planets that may harbor hypothetical [[extraterrestrial life]].

===Physical, mental and emotional health risks to colonizers===
{{main|Effect of spaceflight on the human body}}
An additional concern is the health of the humans who may participate in a colonization venture, including a range of physical, mental and emotional health risks.

==Involved organizations==

Organizations that contribute to space colonization include:

[[File:Space Engineers 5.jpg|thumb|''Space Engineers'' video game: 3D spatial navigation]]
'''Spatial ability''' or visuo-spatial ability is the capacity to understand, reason and remember the spatial relations among objects or space.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://web.jhu.edu/cty/STBguide.pdf|title = Spatial ability|date = |accessdate = |website = www.jhu.edu|publisher = Johns Hopkins University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visual-spatial abilities are used for everyday use from navigation, understanding or fixing equipment, understanding or estimating distance and measurement, and performing on a job. Spatial abilities are also important for success in fields such as sports, technical aptitude, [[mathematics]], natural sciences, [[engineering]], economic forecasting, [[meteorology]], [[chemistry]] and [[physics]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://web.jhu.edu/cty/STBguide.pdf|title = What is spatial ability?|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Johns Hopkins University|author = Johns Hopkins University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Women in Science and Mathematics|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK23762/|date = 2006-01-01|first = National Academy of Sciences|last = (us)|first2 = National Academy of Engineering|last2 = (us)|first3 = and Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Maximizing the Potential of Women in Academic Science and|last3 = Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do spatial abilities involve understanding the outside world, but they also involve processing outside information and reasoning with it through visual representation in the mind.

== Definition and types ==
Spatial ability is the capacity to understand, reason and remember the spatial relations among objects or space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are four common types of spatial abilities which include spatial or visuo-spatial perception, spatial visualization, mental folding and [[mental rotation]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Impact of cognitive imaging and sex differences on the development of laparoscopic suturing skills|journal = Canadian Journal of Surgery|date = 2005-10-01|issn = 0008-428X|pmc = 3211902|pmid = 16248138|pages = 387–393|volume = 48|issue = 5|first = Tyrone|last = Donnon|first2 = Jean-Gaston|last2 = DesCôteaux|first3 = Claudio|last3 = Violato}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these abilities have unique properties and importance to many types of tasks whether in certain jobs or everyday life. For example, spatial perception is defined as the ability to perceive spatial relationships in respect to the orientation of one's body despite distracting information.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emergence and Characterization of Sex Differences in Spatial Ability: A Meta-Analysis|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19086027_Emergence_and_Characterization_of_Sex_Differences_in_Spatial_Ability_A_Meta-Analysis|journal = Child Development|pages = 1479–1498|volume = 56|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1985.tb00213.x|first = Marcia C.|last = Linn|first2 = Anne C.|last2 = Petersen}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mental rotation]] on the other hand is the mental ability to manipulate and rotate 2D or 3D objects in space quickly and accurately.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Lastly, spatial visualization is characterized as complicated multi-step manipulations of spatially presented information.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; These three abilities are mediated and supported by a fourth spatial cognitive factor known as spatial working memory. [[Spatial memory|Spatial working memory]] is the ability to temporarily store a certain amount of visual-spatial memories under attentional control in order to complete a task.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Comparison of Laboratory and Clinical Working Memory Tests and Their Prediction of Fluid Intelligence|journal = Intelligence|date = 2009-05-01|issn = 0160-2896|pmc = 2818304|pmid = 20161647|pages = 283|volume = 37|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2008.11.005|first = Jill T.|last = Shelton|first2 = Emily M.|last2 = Elliott|first3 = B. D.|last3 = Hill|first4 = Matthew R.|last4 = Calamia|first5 = Wm. Drew|last5 = Gouvier}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cognitive ability mediates individual differences in the capacity for higher level spatial abilities such as mental rotation.

=== Spatial perception ===
[[File:Видеоскриншот из игры S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Mobile.gif|thumb|Action shooting game: Use of spatial perceptual skills]]
Spatial perception is defined as the ability to perceive spatial relationships in respect to the orientation of one's body despite distracting information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It consists of being able to perceive and visually understand outside spatial information such as features, properties, measurement, shapes, position and motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~asimmons/pdfs/PT%20Spatial%20Perception.pdf|title = Spatial Perception from a Cartesian Point of View|last = Simmons|first = Alison|date = 2003|journal = Philosophical Topics |volume=31|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when one is navigating through a dense forest they are using spatial perception and awareness. Another example is when trying to understand the relations and mechanics inside of a car, he or she is relying on their spatial perception to understand its visual framework. Tests that measure spatial perception include the [[rod and frame test]], where subjects must place a rod vertically while viewing a frame orientation of 22 degrees in angle, or the [[water-level task]], where subjects have to draw or identify a horizontal line in a tilted bottle.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Spatial perception is also very relevant in sports. For example, a study found that [[cricket]] players who were faster at picking up information from briefly presented visual displays were significantly better batsmen in an actual game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Inspection time and high-speed ball games|journal = Perception|date = 1989-01-01|issn = 0301-0066|pmid = 2628929|pages = 789–792|volume = 18|issue = 6|first = I. J.|last = Deary|first2 = H.|last2 = Mitchell|doi=10.1068/p180789}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study published in the ''[[Journal of Vision]]'' found that soccer players had higher perceptual ability for body kinematics such as processing multitasking crowd scenes which involve pedestrians crossing a street or complex dynamic visual scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Assessment of sport specific and non-specific biological motion perception in soccer athletes shows a fundamental perceptual ability advantage over non-athletes for recognizing body kinematics|journal = Journal of Vision|date = 2015-09-01|issn = 1534-7362|pmid = &lt;!--none--&gt;|pages = 504|volume = 15|issue = 12|doi = 10.1167/15.12.504|first = Thomas|last = Romeas|first2 = Jocelyn|last2 = Faubert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study published in the ''Journal of Human Kinetics'' on fencing athletes found that achievement level was highly correlated with spatial perceptual skills such as visual discrimination, visual-spatial relationships, visual sequential memory, narrow attentional focus and visual information processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Attention, Visual Perception and their Relationship to Sport Performance in Fencing|journal = Journal of Human Kinetics|date = 2013-12-31|issn = 1640-5544|pmc = 3916930|pmid = 24511355|pages = 195–201|volume = 39|doi = 10.2478/hukin-2013-0082|first = Mona Mohamed Kamal|last = Hijazi}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review published in the journal of ''[[Neuropsychologia]]'' found that spatial perception involves attributing meaning to an object or space, so that their sensory processing is actually part of semantic processing of the incoming visual information.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Visual cognition: a new look at the two-visual systems model|journal = Neuropsychologia|date = 2005-01-01|issn = 0028-3932|pmid = 15707914|pages = 301–312|volume = 43|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.11.016|first = M.|last = Jeannerod|first2 = P.|last2 = Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review also found that spatial perception involves the [[Visual system|human visual system]] in the brain and the [[Parietal lobe|parietal lobule]] which is responsible for visuomotor processing and visually goal-directed action.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Studies have also found that individuals who played first person shooting games had better spatial perceptual skills like faster and more accurate performance in a peripheral and identification task while simultaneously performing a central search.&lt;ref name="Wu 673–686"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Playing shooter and driving videogames improves top-down guidance in visual search|journal = Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics|date = 2013-05-01|issn = 1943-393X|pmid = 23460295|pages = 673–686|volume = 75|issue = 4|doi = 10.3758/s13414-013-0440-2|first = Sijing|last = Wu|first2 = Ian|last2 = Spence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers suggested that, in addition to enhancing the ability to divide attention, playing  action games significantly enhances perceptual skills like top-down guidance of attention to possible target locations.&lt;ref name="Wu 673–686" /&gt;

=== Mental rotation ===
[[File:Rubik's cube 2.svg|thumb|[[Rubik's cube]]: a popular puzzle that involves 3D mental rotation]][[Mental rotation]] is the ability to mentally represent and ''rotate'' 2D and 3D objects in space quickly and accurately, while the object's features remain unchanged. Mental representations of physical objects can help utilize problem solving and understanding. For example, Hegarty (2004) showed that people manipulate mental representations for reasoning about mechanical problems, such as how gears or pulleys work.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Online Psychology Laboratory - About Mental Rotation|url = http://opl.apa.org/Experiments/About/AboutMentalRotation.aspx|website = opl.apa.org|accessdate = 2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Schwartz and Black (1999) found that doing such mental simulations such as pouring water improves people's skill to find the solution to questions about the amount of tilt required for containers of different heights and widths.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the field of sports psychology, coaches for a variety of sports (e.g. basketball, gymnastics, soccer or golf) have promoted players to use mental imagery and manipulation as one technique for performance in their game. (Jones &amp; Stuth, 1997)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Recent research (e.g., Cherney, 2008) has also demonstrated evidence that playing video games with consistent practice can improve mental rotation skills, for example improvements in women's scores  after practice with a game that involved a race within a 3-D environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Same effects have been seen playing action video games such as [[Unreal Tournament]] as well as the popular mainstream game [[Tetris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The virtual brain: 30 years of video-game play and cognitive abilities|journal = Frontiers in Psychology|date = 2013-09-13|issn = 1664-1078|pmc = 3772618|pmid = 24062712|volume = 4|doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00629|first = Andrew J.|last = Latham|first2 = Lucy L. M.|last2 = Patston|first3 = Lynette J.|last3 = Tippett}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jigsaw puzzle|Jigsaw]] puzzles and [[Rubik's Cube|Rubik's cube]] are also activities that involve higher level of mental rotation and can be practiced to improve spatial abilities over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Early Puzzle Play: A predictor of preschoolers’ spatial transformation skill|journal = Developmental Psychology|date = 2012-03-01|issn = 0012-1649|pmc = 3289766|pmid = 22040312|pages = 530–542|volume = 48|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/a0025913|first = S.C.|last = Levine|first2 = K.R.|last2 = Ratliff|first3 = J.|last3 = Huttenlocher|first4 = J.|last4 = Cannon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Talent in autism: hyper-systemizing, hyper-attention to detail and sensory hypersensitivity|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date = 2009-05-27|issn = 0962-8436|pmc = 2677592|pmid = 19528020|pages = 1377–1383|volume = 364|issue = 1522|doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0337|first = Simon|last = Baron-Cohen|first2 = Emma|last2 = Ashwin|first3 = Chris|last3 = Ashwin|first4 = Teresa|last4 = Tavassoli|first5 = Bhismadev|last5 = Chakrabarti}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Adolescence: The Transitional Years|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sz20BQAAQBAJ|publisher = Academic Press|date = 2014-05-10|isbn = 9781483265650|first = J. Roy|last = Hopkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental rotation is also unique and distinct from the other spatial abilities because it also involves areas associated with [[Motor skill|motor simulation]] in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Neuroimaging studies of mental rotation: a meta-analysis and review|journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date = 2008-01-01|issn = 0898-929X|pmid = 17919082|pages = 1–19|volume = 20|issue = 1|doi = 10.1162/jocn.2008.20013|first = Jeffrey M.|last = Zacks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spatial visualization ===
Spatial visualization is characterized as complicated multi-step manipulations of spatially presented information.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; It involves [[Mental image|visual imagery]] which is the ability to mentally represent visual appearances of an object, and [[Mental image|spatial imagery]] which consists of mentally representing spatial relations between the parts or locations of the objects or movements.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ideal-group.org/visualization-research/Spatial-Visualization-Visual-Imagery-and-Mathematical-Problem-Solving-of-Students-with-Varying-Abilities.pdf|title = Spatial Visualization, Visual Imagery, and Mathematical Problem Solving of Students With Varying Abilities|last = Van Garderen|first = Delinda|date = 2006|journal = JOURNAL OF LEARNING DISABILITIES VOLUME 39, NUMBER 6|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spatial visualization is especially important in the domains of science and technology. For example, an astronomer must mentally visualize the structures of a solar system and the motions of the objects within it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; An engineer mentally visualizes the interactions of the parts of a machine or building that he or she is assigned to design or work with.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Chemists must be able to understand formulas which can be viewed as abstract models of molecules with most of the spatial information deleted; spatial skills are important in restoring that information when more detailed mental models of the molecules are needed in the formulas.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Spatial visualization also involves imagining and working with visual details of measurement, shapes, motion, features and properties through mental imagery and using this spatial relations to derive at an understanding to a problem. Whereas spatial perception involves understanding externally via the senses, spatial visualization is the understanding internally through mental imagery in one's mind.

Another critical spatial visualization ability is '''mental animation'''.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mental animation in the visuospatial sketchpad: evidence from dual-task studies|journal = Memory &amp; Cognition|date = 1997-05-01|issn = 0090-502X|pmid = 9184484|pages = 321–332|volume = 25|issue = 3|first = V. K.|last = Sims|first2 = M.|last2 = Hegarty|doi=10.3758/bf03211288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental animation is mentally visualizing the motion and movement of components within any form of system or in general.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It is an ability highly crucial in mechanical reasoning and understanding, for example mental animation in mechanical tasks can involve deconstructing a pulley system mentally into smaller units and animating them in the corresponding sequence or laws in the mechanical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mental animation: inferring motion from static displays of mechanical systems|journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date = 1992-09-01|issn = 0278-7393|pmid = 1402712|pages = 1084–1102|volume = 18|issue = 5|first = M.|last = Hegarty|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.18.5.1084}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, mental animation is mental imagining how mechanical objects work by analyzing the motion of their smaller parts.

'''Mental folding''' is a complex spatial visualization that involves the ''folding'' of 2D pattern or material into 3D objects and representations.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mental Paper Folding Performance Following Penetrating Traumatic Brain Injury in Combat Veterans: A Lesion Mapping Study|journal = Cerebral Cortex (New York, NY)|date = 2013-07-01|issn = 1047-3211|pmc = 3673178|pmid = 22669970|pages = 1663–1672|volume = 23|issue = 7|doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhs153|first = Leila|last = Glass|first2 = Frank|last2 = Krueger|first3 = Jeffrey|last3 = Solomon|first4 = Vanessa|last4 = Raymont|first5 = Jordan|last5 = Grafman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other studies, mental folding has had relatively little research and study. In comparison to mental rotation, mental folding is a non-rigid spatial transformation ability which means features of the manipulated object end up changing unlike mental rotation. In rigid manipulations, the object itself is not changed but rather its spatial position or orientation is, whereas in non-rigid transformations like mental folding the object and shapes are changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Understanding spatial transformations: similarities and differences between mental rotation and mental folding|journal = Cognitive Processing|date = 2013-05-01|issn = 1612-4790|pmid = 23397105|pages = 105–115|volume = 14|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s10339-013-0544-6|first = Justin|last = Harris|first2 = Kathy|last2 = Hirsh-Pasek|first3 = Nora S.|last3 = Newcombe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental folding in tasks usually require a series of mental rotations to sequentially fold the object into a new one. Classic mental folding tests are the Paper folding task which is similar to [[Origami]]. Origami also requires mental folding by assessing folding a 2D paper enough times to create a 3D figure.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

'''Visual penetrative ability''' is least common spatial visualization task which involves ability to imagine what is inside an object based on the features outside.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Spatial working memory ==
[[Spatial memory|Spatial working memory]] is the ability to temporarily store visual-spatial memories under [[attentional control]], in order to complete a task.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This cognitive ability mediates individual differences in the capacity for higher level spatial abilities, such as mental rotation. Spatial working memory involves storing large amounts of short-term spatial memories in relation to visuo-spatial sketchpad. It is used in the temporary storage and manipulation of visual-spatial information such as memorizing shapes, colours, location or motion of objects in space. It is also involved in tasks which consist of planning of spatial movements, like planning one's route through a complex building. The visuospatial sketchpad can be split  into separate visual, spatial and possibly kin-aesthetic (movement) components. Its neurobiological function also correlates within the right [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01538-2|last1 = Baddeley|first1 = A.D.|year = 2000|title = The episodic buffer: A new component of working memory?|url = |journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume = 4|issue = 11|pages = 417–423|pmid = 11058819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vocational applications ==
Researchers have found that spatial ability plays an important role in advanced educational credentials in the science, technology, engineering or math (STEM).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://my.vanderbilt.edu/smpy/files/2013/02/Wai2009SpatialAbility.pdf|title = Spatial Ability for STEM Domains: Aligning Over 50 Years of cumulative psychological Knowledge solidifies Its importance|last = Wai|first = Jonathan|date = 2009|journal = Journal of Educational Psychology|doi = 10.1037/a0016127|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Why do spatial abilities predict mathematical performance?|journal = Developmental Science|date = 2014-05-01|issn = 1363-755X|pmc = 3997754|pmid = 24410830|pages = 462–470|volume = 17|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/desc.12138|first = Maria Grazia|last = Tosto|first2 = Ken B.|last2 = Hanscombe|first3 = Claire M.A.|last3 = Haworth|first4 = Oliver S.P.|last4 = Davis|first5 = Stephen A.|last5 = Petrill|first6 = Philip S.|last6 = Dale|first7 = Sergey|last7 = Malykh|first8 = Robert|last8 = Plomin|first9 = Yulia|last9 = Kovas}}&lt;/ref&gt; From studies, it has been indicated that the probability of getting an advanced degree in STEM increases in positive relation to the level of one's spatial ability. For example, a 2009 study published in the [[Journal of Educational Psychology]] found that 45% of those with [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|STEM]] PhDs were within top percentage of high spatial ability in a group of 400,000 participants who were analyzed for 11 years since they were in the 12th grade.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Only less than 10% of those with [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|STEM]] PhDs were below the top quarter in spatial ability during adolescence.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The researchers then concluded how important spatial ability is for [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|STEM]] and as a factor in achieving advanced educational success in that field.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Spatial visualization is especially important in [[science]] and [[technology]]. For example, an [[astronomer]] must visually imagine the structures of a solar system, and the path of the bodies within it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; An engineer must visually imagine the motions of the parts of a machine or building that he or she is assigned to work with.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Chemists must be able to understand formulas which are essentially abstract models supposed to represent spatial dynamics of molecules, and thus spatial skills are important in visualizing the molecule models that are needed in the formulas.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Spatial manipulation ability is also important in the field of structural geology, when visually imagining how rocks change through time, such as migration of a magma body through crust or progressive folding of a strati-graphic succession. Another spatial visualization skill known as ''visual penetrative ability'' is important in geology as it requires geologists to visualize what is inside of a solid object based on past knowledge.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://nagt-jge.org/doi/pdf/10.5408/1.3559671|title = Characterizing and Improving Spatial Visualization Skills|last = Titus|first = Sarah|date = 2009|journal = Journal of Geoscience Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current literature also indicates that mathematics involves visuo-spatial processing. Studies have found that gifted students in math, for instance, perform better in spatial visualization than non-gifted students.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A 2008 review published in the journal of ''Neuroscience Biobehavioural Reviews'' found evidence that visuo-spatial processing is intuitively involved in many aspects of processing numbers and calculating in math. For example, meaning of a digit in a multi-digit number is coded following spatial information given its relation to its position within the number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Visualizing numbers in the mind's eye: the role of visuo-spatial processes in numerical abilities|journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|date = 2008-10-01|issn = 0149-7634|pmid = 18584868|pages = 1361–1372|volume = 32|issue = 8|doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.05.015|first = Maria Dolores|last = de Hevia|first2 = Giuseppe|last2 = Vallar|first3 = Luisa|last3 = Girelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that numerical estimation might rely on integrating different visual-spatial cues (diameter, size, location, measurement) to infer an answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The role of visual information in numerosity estimation|journal = PLOS ONE|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 1932-6203|pmc = 3355123|pmid = 22616007|pages = e37426|volume = 7|issue = 5|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0037426|first = Titia|last = Gebuis|first2 = Bert|last2 = Reynvoet}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in 2014 also found evidence that mathematical calculation relies on the integration of various spatial processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Doing arithmetic by hand: hand movements during exact arithmetic reveal systematic, dynamic spatial processing|journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology]]|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1747-0226|pmid = 25051274|pages = 1579–1596|volume = 67|issue = 8|doi = 10.1080/17470218.2014.897359|first = Tyler|last = Marghetis|first2 = Rafael|last2 = Núñez|first3 = Benjamin K.|last3 = Bergen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2015 study published in the journal of ''[[Frontiers in Psychology]]'' also found that numerical processing and arithmetic performance may rely on visual perceptual ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Visual perception can account for the close relation between numerosity processing and computational fluency|journal = Frontiers in Psychology|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 1664-1078|pmc = 4563146|pmid = 26441740|pages = 1364|volume = 6|doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01364|first = Xinlin|last = Zhou|first2 = Wei|last2 = Wei|first3 = Yiyun|last3 = Zhang|first4 = Jiaxin|last4 = Cui|first5 = Chuansheng|last5 = Chen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study published in the journal of [[Cognitive science|''Cognitive Science'']] also found that spatial visualization ability is crucial for solving [[Kinematics|kinematic]] problems in physics. Nonetheless, current literature indicates that spatial abilities specifically mental rotation, is crucial for achieving success in various fields of chemistry, engineering and physics.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Spatial Ability in Learning Engineering Mechanics: Critical Review|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282853648_Spatial_Ability_in_Learning_Engineering_Mechanics_Critical_Review|website = ResearchGate|access-date = 2016-01-15|doi = 10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''General Systemantics''''' (retitled to '''''Systemantics''''' in its second edition and '''''The Systems Bible''''' in its third) is a [[systems engineering]] treatise by [[John Gall (author)|John Gall]] in which he offers practical principles of systems design based on experience and anecdotes.

It is offered from the perspective of how '''not''' to design systems, based on system engineering failures.  The primary precept of treatise is that large [[complex system]]s are extremely difficult to design correctly despite best intentions and so care must be taken to design smaller less complex systems and to do so with incremental functionality based on close and continual touch with user needs and measures of effectiveness.

== Title origin ==
The term '''systemantics''' is a commentary on prior work by [[Alfred Korzybski]] called [[General Semantics]] which conjectured that all systems failures could be attributed to a single root cause—a failure to communicate.  Dr. Gall observes that, instead, system failure is an ''intrinsic feature of systems''.  He thereby derives the term 'General Systemantics' in deference to the notion of a sweeping theory of system failure, but attributed to an intrinsic feature based on laws of system behavior.  He observes as a side-note that system antics also playfully captures the concept that systems naturally "act up."

== Background ==

=== Premise ===
:* &lt;big&gt;'''''Systems in general work poorly or not at all.&lt;ref name=Gall1978-22&gt;{{cite book|last=Gall|first=John|title=Systemantics|year=1978|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-671-81910-0|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''''&lt;/big&gt;

This is more a universal observation than a law.  The origin of this observation is traced back:
# [[Murphy's Law]] that "if anything can go wrong, it will",
# [[Korzybski|Alfred Korzybski's]] [[General Semantics]] notion of failure's root cause being a communication problem,
# Humorist [[Stephen Potter|Stephen Potter's]] [[One-upmanship]] on ways to "game" the system for personal benefit,
# Historian [[C. Northcote Parkinson|C. Northcote Parkinson's]] principle called [[Parkinson's Law]] -- "Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion"
# Educator [[Laurence J. Peter|Lawrence J. Peter's]] widely cited [[Peter Principle]] -- "In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence ... in time every post tends to be occupied by an employee who is incompetent to carry out its duties ... Work is accomplished by those employees who have not yet reached their level of incompetence."

=== Scope ===
By "systems", the author refers to those that "...involve human beings, particularly those very large systems such as national governments, nations themselves, religions, the railway system, the post office..." though the intention is that the principles are general to any system.

Additionally, the author observes.
# Everything is a system.
# Everything is part of a larger system.
# The universe is infinitely systematized, both upward (larger systems) and downward (smaller systems).
# All systems are infinitely complex.

== First principles ==
:* &lt;big&gt;'''''New Systems mean new problems.&lt;ref name=Gall1978-29&gt;{{cite book|last=Gall|first=John|title=Systemantics|year=1978|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-671-81910-0|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''''&lt;/big&gt;

Once a system is set up to solve some problem, the system itself engenders new problems relating to its development, operations and maintenance. The author points out that the additional energy required to support the system can consume the energy it was meant to save.  This leads to the next principle.

:* &lt;big&gt;'''''The total amount of [[Exergy|anergy]] in the universe is fixed.'''''&lt;/big&gt;

The author defined [[Exergy|anergy]] as the energy required to bring about a change.  This was meant as a tongue-in-cheek analog of the law of conservation of energy.

:* &lt;big&gt;'''''Systems tend to expand to fill the known universe.'''''&lt;/big&gt;

One of the problems that a system creates is that it becomes an entity unto itself that not only persists but expands and encroaches on areas beyond the original system's purview.

== Why systems behave poorly ==
:* &lt;big&gt;'''''Complicated systems produce unexpected outcomes&lt;/big&gt;''''' &lt;small&gt;[Generalized Uncertainty Principle]&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref name=Gall1978-40&gt;{{cite book|last=Gall|first=John|title=Systemantics|year=1978|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-671-81910-0|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author cites a number of spectacular unexpected behaviors including:
# The [[Aswan Dam]] diverting the [[Nile]] River's fertilizing sediment to [[Lake Nasser]] (where it is useless) requiring the dam to operate at full electrical generating capacity to run the artificial fertilizer plants needed to replace the diverted sediment.
# The space [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] at [[Kennedy Space Center]] designed to protect vehicles from weather is so large that it produces its own weather

== Feedback ==
Not only do systems expand well beyond their original goals, but as they evolve they tend to oppose even their own original goals.  This is seen as a systems theory analog of [[Le Chatelier's principle]] that suggests chemical and physical processes tend to counteract changed conditions that upset equilibrium until a new equilibrium is established.  This same counteraction force can be seen in systems behavior. For example, incentive reward systems set up in business can have the effect of institutionalizing mediocrity.&lt;ref name=[Pink2011]&gt;{{cite book|last=Pink|first=Daniel|title=Drive|year=2011|publisher=Penguin|isbn=1594484805}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This leads to the following principle.

:* &lt;big&gt;'''''Systems tend to oppose their own proper function.&lt;ref name=Gall1978-48&gt;{{cite book|last=Gall|first=John|title=Systemantics|year=1978|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-671-81910-0|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''''&lt;/big&gt;

== What's in a name ==
People performing roles in systems often do not perform the role suggested by the name the system gives that person, nor does the system itself perform the role that its name suggests.

:* &lt;big&gt;'''''People in systems do not actually do what the system says they are doing'''''&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;[Functionary's Falsity]&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref name=Gall1978-58&gt;{{cite book|last=Gall|first=John|title=Systemantics|year=1978|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-671-81910-0|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* &lt;big&gt;'''''The system itself does not actually do what it says it is doing.'''''&lt;/big&gt; [The Operational Fallacy]

== Inside systems ==
:* &lt;big&gt;'''''The real world is what it is reported to the system'''''&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;[The Fundamental Law of Administrative Workings (F.L.A.W.)]&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref name=Gall1978-65&gt;{{cite book|last=Gall|first=John|title=Systemantics|year=1978|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-671-81910-0|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the system has a severely censored and distorted view of reality from biased and filtering sensory organs which displaces understanding of the actual real-world which pales and tends to disappear.  This displacement creates a type of sensory deprivation and a kind of hallucinogenic effect on those inside the systems, causing them to lose common sense.  In addition to negatively affecting those inside the system, the system attracts to it people who are optimized for the pathological environment the system creates.  Thus,

:* &lt;big&gt;'''''Systems attract systems-people'''''&lt;/big&gt;

== Elementary systems functions ==
# A complex system cannot be "made" to work. It either works or it doesn't.
# A simple system, designed from scratch, sometimes works.
# Some complex systems actually work.
# A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that works.
# '''A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system.'''

== Advanced systems functions ==
# The Functional Indeterminacy Theorem (F.I.T.): In complex systems, malfunction and even total non-function may not be detectable for long periods, if ever.
# The Newtonian Law of Systems Inertia: A system that performs a certain way will continue to operate in that way regardless of the need or of changed conditions.
# Systems develop goals of their own the instant they come into being.
# Intrasystem goals come first.

== System failure ==
# The Fundamental Failure-Mode Theorem (F.F.T.): complex systems usually operate in a failure mode.
# A complex system can fail in an infinite number of ways. (If anything can go wrong, it will; see [[Murphy's law]].)
# The mode of failure of a complex system cannot ordinarily be predicted from its structure.
# The crucial variables are discovered by accident.
# The larger the system, the greater the probability of unexpected failure.
# "Success" or "Function" in any system may be failure in the larger or smaller systems to which the system is connected.
# '''The Fail-Safe Theorem: When a Fail-Safe system fails, it fails by failing to fail safe.'''

== Practical systems design ==
# The Vector Theory of Systems: Systems run better when designed to run downhill.
# Loose systems last longer and work better. (Efficient systems are dangerous to themselves and to others.)

== Management and other myths ==
# Complex systems tend to produce complex responses (not solutions) to problems.
# Great advances are not produced by systems designed to produce great advances.

== Other laws of systemantics ==
# As systems grow in size, they tend to lose basic functions.
# The larger the system, the less the variety in the product.
# Control of a system is exercised by the element with the greatest variety of behavioral responses.
# Colossal systems foster colossal errors.
# Choose your systems with care.

{{Spatial anomalies in fiction}}
[[Teleportation]]  is the theoretical transfer of [[matter]] or [[energy]] from one point to another without traversing the physical space between them. It is a common subject in [[science fiction]] literature, film, [[video games]], and television. In some situations teleporting is time travelling across space.

The use of matter transmitters in science fiction originated at least as early as the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Matter Transmission'' in John Clute and, Peter Nichols (ed), ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'',Orbit, 1999 {{ISBN|1 85723 897 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early example of scientific teleportation (as opposed to magical or spiritual teleportation) is found in the 1897 novel ''[[To Venus in Five Seconds]]'' by [[Fred T. Jane]]. Jane's protagonist is transported from a strange-machinery-containing [[gazebo]] on Earth to planet [[Venus]] – hence the title.

==Use ==

The notion of a teleporter is useful in literature as it avoids the necessity to depict lengthy transportation sequences by rocket or other means. Usually for story purposes the transmission between source and destination is considered to be [[Faster-than-light|faster than the speed of light]].

The mechanics of teleportation vary depending on the scientific theories available to the author.  For example, in [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]'  series of Mars novels, the protagonist arrives at Mars by wishing. Other modalities of teleportation include electricity, radio, nuclear explosions,  black holes, quantum entanglement, and conversion of matter to energy, then beaming the energy to the destination. The authors of such stories nearly always disregard the practicalities of handing the [[exajoule]]s of energy that would result from the conversion of a 55&amp;nbsp;kg protagonist to immaterial form.  The matter transmitter system may require elaborate machinery at the sending end, the receiving end, or both.  Sending a receiver to a destination may require slower-than-light travel, but subsequent transmissions may be instantaneous.  In later installments of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' films, the entire rationale for gigantic lumbering interstellar ships was undermined by the introduction of a small portable transporter device capable of sending a person over interstellar distances.

The teleportation process is usually considered to make an exact duplicate of the original; but some stories use the process as a way to alter the duplicate in some way. For example, in [[Larry Niven]]'s novel ''[[World out of Time]]'', the widely used transporters of the story have a variant that is used to enhance longevity, notionally by removing debris from cells that accumulates with age. Sometimes the alterations are inadvertent and destructive; for example in the film ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'', a teleporter accident results in the fusion of a human being with a fly.

Often a story will describe the consequences of the use of a teleporter, especially on human beings.  Where the teleporter essentially creates a remote duplicate of the transmitted person, the story may analyze the consequences of an interruption or communication failure on the original person.  There may be an investigation of the morality of destroying the original so that the remote duplicate retains the identity of the individual. An example is the novelette ''[[Think Like a Dinosaur]]''  where the protagonist is compelled to destroy a woman who was inadvertently revived following a communication error with the receiving station.  Occasionally remote duplication is used as a method to allow characters to remotely explore environments too dangerous to otherwise investigate.  Sometimes the story postulates some form of [[mental telepathy]] "link" between the duplicate and the original, facilitating communication of observations from the hazardous environment. One example of this approach is in the [[Algis Budrys]] short story "Rogue Moon".

==Interstellar transporters==

An interstellar teleporter is a hypothetical [[technology]] appearing in [[science fiction]], typically in [[soft science fiction]], which [[Teleportation|teleport]]s people or objects over interstellar distances instantaneously.

* The Door in [[Lloyd Biggle Jr.]]'s short story ''[[The Rule of the Door]]''.

* An intergalactic teleporter made a brief appearance in the [[John Carpenter]] [[horror film|horror]] film ''[[They Live]]''.
* The ''[[Supreme Commander (video game)|Supreme Commander]]'' Saga where space explorers travel through Interstellar Teleporters.
* Wormholes feature in [[Peter F. Hamilton]]'s ''[[Commonwealth Saga]]'', connecting over 600 worlds.
* Land-based wormhole gates in [[Robert Charles Wilson]]'s novel ''[[Spin (novel)|Spin]]''.

* In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[The Daleks Master Plan]]'', set in the year 4000, the [[First Doctor]], Steven and [[Sara Kingdom]] accidentally get caught up in a transmat experiment that sends them to the Planet Mira, which is 'many light years' from Earth.
* In ''[[Mass Effect]]'', Mass Relays are massive interstellar teleporters. The first one discovered by mankind is the Charon Relay, which humanity previously thought to be a moon of Pluto.
* In [[EVE Online]], stargates allow players to travel from one system to another, and jump drives allow capital ships or black ops to jump to other systems where cynos exist.

== List of fiction containing teleportation ==

===Myths===

* Lady Po Nagar:  The founding legend of the Kingdom of [[Champa]] (in present-day [[Vietnam]]) refers to [[Lady Po Nagar]], originally a peasant girl who went to China, married a son of its Emperor and had two children with him. When her husband refused to let her go back to visit her family, she flung a magical piece of [[sandalwood]] into the ocean, and thereby disappeared with her children from China and reappeared at [[Nha Trang]] in Vietnam, whereupon she became the Queen of Champa.
* In ''[[The Arabian Nights]]'', [[djinn]]s are depicted as capable of instantaneously transporting themselves from [[China]] to [[Morocco]] and back, and of taking with them en route as much as a whole royal palace with its entire animate and inanimate contents. This is presented as part of a djinn's inborn [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] powers.
* The concept of [[Kefitzat Haderech]] ({{Hebrew name 1|קְפִיצַת הַדֶּרֶךְ|Qəfiẓat haDéreḫ|}}), which literally means "contracting the path" and refers to a miraculous travel between two distant places, is recurring in [[Jewish culture]] from the [[Talmud]] up to the writings of [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]].
* [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' features the [[Tarnhelm]].  a magic helmet which confers, among other things, the power of teleportation. [[Sigurd|Siegfried]] makes use of this possibility in ''[[Götterdämmerung]]'', Act II, Scene 2.

===Written fiction===
* ''[[The Tempest]]''. [[William Shakespeare]] toys with the idea of teleportation in ''[[The Tempest]]'' (1610–1611).&lt;ref&gt;

* Perhaps the earliest science fiction story to depict human beings achieving the ability of teleportation in science fiction is [[Edward Page Mitchell]]'s 1877 story ''The Man Without a Body'', which details the efforts of a scientist who discovers a method to disassemble a cat's [[atom]]s, transmit them over a [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] wire, and then reassemble them. When he tries this on himself, the telegraph's battery dies after only the man's head is transmitted.&lt;ref name=kaku2008&gt;{{citation | first=Michio | last=Kaku | year=2008 | title=Physics of the impossible: a scientific exploration into the world of phasers, force fields, teleportation, and time travel | publisher=Random House Digital, Inc. | isbn=0-385-52069-7 | contribution=Teleportation and Science Fiction | page=54&amp;ndash;55 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ube-MQcFFZQC&amp;pg=PA54 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The silver slippers in ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' function as a teleportation device. 
* The idea of a matter transmitter was lampooned in the 1897 novel ''[[To Venus in Five Seconds]]''.
* The book ''Magic and Mystery in Tibet'' by French explorer [[Alexandra David-Néel]] mentions the [[Tibet]]an cultural concept of ''[[Lung-gom-pa]]'', a special skill attainable by adepts which confers the ability to move nearly instantaneously from point to point.
* [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s ''[[The Disintegration Machine]]'' (a 1927 [[Professor Challenger]] story) also revolves around the idea of teleportation.&lt;ref name=kaku2008/&gt;
* In ''[[A Certain Magical Index]]'', 2.3 million students have [[Esper (mythology)|esper]] ability, classified from level 0 to level 5: level 0 is no ability and level 5 is the most powerful and dangerous. One of the supporting characters, [[List of A Certain Magical Index characters#Tokiwadai Middle School|Shirai Kuroko]], is a teleporter; she becomes the main character in the [[A Certain Magical Index#Manga|spin-off]]. Her power is instant teleportation, which allows her to teleport herself and/or anything she touches under a total weight of around 130-137 kilograms to anywhere within a radius of around 81–85 meters. She is classified as Level 4. Another character, [[List of Toaru Majutsu no Index characters#Kirigaoka Academy for Girls|Awaki Musujime]], has an ability called Move Point. Her teleportation powers are more powerful than Kuroko's, as she can teleport anything weighing up to 4,500&amp;nbsp;kg without even touching it for a distance up to 800 meters. However, due to a past trauma where she miscalculated and teleported her leg inside a wall, accidentally tearing her leg skin and muscles out from the wall and almost dying, she has a fear of using her powers on herself and feels physically ill whenever she is forced to teleport herself. This fear prevents her from becoming a Level 5.
* In ''[[The Engines of Dawn]]'' teleportation works by a sort of portal that uses a technique called [[Fractal Compression]], which unlinks molecular bonds, re-arranges them until they are satisfactorily close together, and transmits them through trans-space to another portal. The organism is rearranged to its previous size with a rush of euphoria.
* In the short story "[[The Fly (George Langelaan)|The Fly]]" by [[George Langelaan]] (and the two films based on it: the 1958 film [[The Fly (1958 film)|''The Fly'']] and its [[The Fly (1986 film)|1986 remake]]), a scientist successfully teleports himself over a short distance but discovers that he has been merged with an unseen housefly that entered the telepod with him. The process of dematerialization and reconstitution combined his molecular structure with that of the fly.
* Teleporting is called tessering in [[Madeleine L’Engle]]’s 1962 juvenile novel ''[[A Wrinkle in Time]]''.  She derived her term from the tesseract, or geometrical fifth dimension.  The book title refers to a vague explanation of how this works given by one of her main extraterrestrial characters.
* In the [[Harry Potter]] book series by [[J. K. Rowling]], there are several methods of teleportation, all of them magical. [[Apparation]] and [[Disapparation]] allow the wizard to disappear in one location and appear in another location. If the wizard is not sufficiently skilled, he can ''splinch'' himself, meaning to leave part of himself behind. A skilled wizard can also take somebody with him while apparating. Because of the risk associated with apparation, a wizard must be of age and licensed in order to apparate; however, many wizards choose not to, as it is very dangerous. Unlicensed, untalented or unwilling wizards can use [[Floo powder]], dust that is sprinkled over a fireplace enabling a connection to another fireplace, and [[Portkey]]s, enchanted objects that transport themselves and anyone holding them to a predetermined place at a predetermined time.
* In [[Douglas Adams]] ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series teleportation has been described as "not quite as fun as a good solid kick to the head" on account of the fact that teleporting involves having your atoms ripped apart in one place and put back together somewhere else. In the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, teleportation is generally frowned upon. One popular poem from the book goes "I teleported home one night with Ron and Sid and Meg, Ron stole Meggie's heart away, and I got Sidney's leg."
* In the novel ''[[Hyperion (Simmons novel)|Hyperion]]'' by [[Dan Simmons]], and its sequels, teleporters known as "Farcasters" play a significant role. These teleporters are essentially portals through which people and objects can be transported. Some farcasters only transmit between two points, whilst others can transport individuals to any other farcaster in existence. Farcasters make possible many strange and advanced phenomena, such as the river Tethys (a river spanning hundreds of worlds, linked by farcaster), or houses where farcasters replace doors, allowing a single building to exist on many different planets at once. Whilst human civilization eventually comes to depend on farcasters for its survival, they permit the AI [[TechnoCore]] to parasitise on human brains as people move through the farcaster network. When this network is destroyed to prevent the TechnoCore from destroying humanity entirely, the Human Hegemony (the leading civilization at the time) collapses.
* In [[Stephen King]]'s short story "[[The Jaunt (short story)|The Jaunt]]", teleportation is a routine form of transportation in the future, but sentient organisms must be asleep while undergoing the process to avoid nightmarish results. When 'Jaunting', a sentient organism's mind does not particulate when transmitted, unlike the physical matter of the organism's body. The mind therefore experiences the Jaunt, but while the particles that make up the organism travel instantaneously, to the conscious mind the trip seems to last forever. In an experiment, a convicted criminal, offered a full pardon on the condition he takes a Jaunt awake, emerges on the other side but instantly suffers a massive heart attack, uttering the cryptic phrase: "It's eternity in there..."; the story features a boy who avoided being knocked unconscious for the trip to see what it was like and was driven apparently hopelessly insane by the sheer loneliness of the experience.
* In [[Steven Gould]]'s book ''[[Jumper (novel)|Jumper]]'', Davy teleports (and later his wife Millie, in ''[[Reflex (novel)|Reflex]])'' by warping Space/Time around himself, creating a wormhole or gate that lets him appear instantaneously anywhere on Earth. Davy uses his power to combat terrorists and avenge his mother's death at their hands. The government figures out that Davy has teleportation powers and attempts to coerce him into working for them on covert operations. In the sequel, ''[[Reflex (novel)|Reflex]]'', a criminal organization with hooks high up in the government, use operant conditioning to force Davy to use his teleportation powers for their ends. ''[[Impulse (Gould novel)|Impulse]]'' and ''[[Exo (novel)|Exo]]'' are the third and fourth novels in the Jumper series and tell the connecting story of David and Millie's daughter Millicent "Cent" as she learns of her own teleporting abilities and how she eventually utilizes them in her own space program. The fifth novel in the Jumper universe, ''[[Jumper: Griffin's Story (novel)|Jumper: Griffin's Story]]'', is the back-story for a character from the 2008 movie ''[[Jumper (2008 film)|Jumper]]'' and is not associated with the story or characters in the novels.  In this book, an organization knows about and hunts these people that can teleport freely, considering them an abomination. The people belonging to the organization are known as Paladins and people who teleport are known as Jumpers.
* In [[Larry Niven]]'s ''[[Ringworld]]'' and in other novels from the Known Space universe, people travel instantaneously from point to point in glass "displacement" booths for a marginal fee.  Destination is specified by dialling a destination number, much like we would dial a telephone today.  Displacement actually occurs at light speed, but because any distance on earth is negligible at that speed, the trip is perceived as instantaneous.
* In the 1973 short story ''Doomship'' by [[Frederick Pohl]] and [[Jack Williamson]], teleportation allows exact duplicates of the subjects to explore the galaxy and to be placed into dangerous and ultimately lethal circumstances, without endangering the original person.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald A. Wollheim]] (ed.), ''Wollheim's World's Best SF Series Three'', Daw Books, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;
* The popular Russian series of children's novels, written by [[Kir Bulychov]], as well as the television adaptation ''[[Guest from the Future]]'', has public transportation set up in this manner on Earth of the future. In the books, the teleportation hubs are made to look like old-fashioned buses with each door having its destination written above it. A person enters the door and proceeds to the identical door on the other side, where he or she comes out in a completely different part of the planet. In the miniseries, the hubs are made to look like paper cut-outs of buses.
* In [[Christopher Priest (novelist)|Christopher Priest]]'s 1995 novel ''[[The Prestige]]'' and the 2006 mystery [[The Prestige (film)|thriller film version]] a magician uses a teleporter built by [[Nikola Tesla]] in his act.
* One particularly novel variety of teleportation can be seen in [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s short-story collection ''[[One Step from Earth]]'', nine stories all revolving around a variety of teleportation Harrison calls ''matter transmission'' (or "MT"). Rather than using the Star Trek metaphor of disassembling and reassembling something, MT works by taking two screens and aligning them to share the same part of another dimension (called "B-space"). "What goes in one comes out the other", as one character puts it. The stories explore the technical difficulties of the system—the screens can be separated by theoretically infinite space, but the quality of that space (such as the presence of gravitational fields) can affect transmission—as well as the social implications of having such a device. In one story, "Waiting Place", a one-way MT screen is used to dump criminals on an isolated planet where they will only be a danger to each other; in another, "Wife to the Lord", a man achieves godhood in the eyes of his people by using the planet's sole MT screen to work miracles.
* [[F. M. Busby]]'s 1993 book ''The Singularity Project'' uses quantum singularities (artificial [[black hole]]s) to transpose two masses.
* ''[[The Stars My Destination]]'', (also known as 'Tiger, Tiger'), by [[Alfred Bester]], tells of a future time when psionic displacement/teleporting has become commonplace. This story is the origin of the term jaunt in the sense of personal teleportation (spelled "jaunte" in the book, from the surname, "Jaunte", of the first person to do so).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=David J. | last=Darling | year=2005 | page=8 | title=Teleportation: the impossible leap | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | isbn=0-471-47095-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W34n5pSs3bsC&amp;pg=PA8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[James Patrick Kelly]]'s 1996 Hugo Award-winning story, ''[[Think Like a Dinosaur]],'' a woman is teleported to an alien planet, but the original is not disintegrated because reception cannot be confirmed at the time. Reception is later confirmed, and the original, not surprisingly, declines to "balance the equation" by re-entering the scanning and disintegrating device. This creates an ethical quandary which is viewed quite differently by the cold-blooded aliens who provided the teleportation technology, and their warm-blooded human associates. This story was subsequently made into an [[Think Like a Dinosaur (The Outer Limits)|episode]] of [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s acclaimed revival of ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]].''  [[Jack Chalker]]'s Soul Rider series explores similar moral issues.
* In the 2003 [[Michael Crichton]] novel ''[[Timeline (novel)|Timeline]]'', the characters are transported back through time by means of [[Quantum teleportation]], which sends them to another universe where the present time is the past of their universe. Michael Crichton distanced himself from [[timeline (2003 film)|the 2003 film]], saying it departed too much from his novel, with teleportation in the film working based on the idea that the organisation discovered a wormhole reaching into the past.
* [[Edmund Cooper]]'s 1964 [[Transit (Cooper novel)|book]] about a group of people, teleported to a distant world to do battle with a similarly displaced group of aliens.
* In [[David Eddings]]' Belgariad and Mallorean series, sorcerers are able to 'translocate' themselves and objects through the power of "The Will and the Word".
* In [[Sheri S. Tepper]]'s series of books set in the world of The True Game, teleportation is one of the eleven psychic abilities which can be possessed by Gamesmen. Those Gamesmen with teleportation as their only talent are called Elators, and can 'port faster and farther than Gamesmen with teleportation plus other talents.
* In [[Robert A Heinlein]]'s story ''[[Tunnel in the Sky]]'' gates, more or less a way to merge 2 places in the universe together through use of a piece of hardware, are being used to colonize various planets. Our hero is taking a class on survival. The final exam is to spend a period of time (2 weeks, a month) on one of the discovered planets.  All of the students are gated to assorted places on the planet, close enough to each other to that they can help each other out.  But a nearby supernova disrupts the calibration of the gates, and it takes more than a year for the network to be re-established. The students form a colony of sorts, learning about the flora and fauna of the planet and how to survive.
* Dragon Ball. When [[Goku|Son Goku]] leaves the destruction of the planet Namek, he lands on a planet called Yardrat. There, the inhabitants teach him how to teleport using a technique labeled {{nihongo|''Shunkan Idō''|瞬間移動|lit. "Instant Movement"|renamed "Instant Transmission" in Funimation's dub}}. The technique is capable of teleporting him from a few meters to vast interstellar distances and even across dimensions (as evident by his ability to teleport to the series' version of [[Hell]] or [[Heaven]]) as long as he is able to sense the [[Qi|ki]] of a lifeform at the location he wishes to go to. Other characters such as [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Cell|Cell]] and [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Majin Boo|Majin Boo]] replicate the technique from Goku, or possess different variations of it.
* In ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'', the character Twilight Sparkle can teleport herself using her unicorn/[[Winged unicorn|alicorn]] magic. This is accompanied by a flash of light and explosive sound or sound of magic, after which she disappears and reappears on other place. Other characters, such as Nightmare Moon and Discord, can also teleport. Both Twilight and Nightmare Moon can teleport other objects or beings besides themselves. The limits of such magic are not known, but in the season 2 episode "Dragon Quest", Twilight has trouble teleporting all her friends to safety.
* The [[Neal Asher]] novel ''[[Gridlinked]]'' (and almost all other novels set in the same universe) makes frequent reference to teleporters known as "Runcibles" which link much of human civilization together (runcible linked worlds form the "Polity", a semi-utopian AI-controlled civilization). These allow for instantaneous teleportation between any two points in the runcible grid. They can be used to transport objects or information, and can be used for time travel (although this normally has serious complications). Despite their widespread usage in this fictional universe, runcibles have not replaced faster-than-light space travel, which remains a common occurrence in the polity.
* Teleportation is a principal plot device in the [[Harold Shea]] stories by [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Fletcher Pratt]] and later other others. The protagonists utilize teleportation to project themselves into the universes and worlds, but it is an inexact science, and they miss their target realities as often as they hit them. Teleportation is also used to extract others, and again there is uncertainty of who or what you would get.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[L. Sprague de Camp]]|author2=[[Fletcher Pratt]]|title=Wall of Serpents|year=1979|publisher=Dell|isbn=0-440-19639-6|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The authors of the [[Golden Age of Science Fiction]] (1938 to 1946) used the concept of teleportation extensively. [[Arthur C. Clarke|Arthur&amp;nbsp;C. Clarke]]'s "[[Travel by Wire!]]" (first published in ''[[Amateur Science Stories]]'', December 1937), [[A. E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'' (''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', August 1945), Isaac Asimov's "[[It's Such a Beautiful Day]]" (''[[Star Science Fiction Stories No.3]]'', 1954), [[George Langelaan]]'s "[[The Fly (George Langelaan)|The Fly]]" (''[[Playboy]]'', June 1957) and [[Algis Budrys]]' ''[[Rogue Moon]]'' (Gold Medal Books, 1960) feature teleportation.
* The ''Keys to the Dimensions'' series of novels, written by [[Kenneth Bulmer]], are about a number of dimensions that can be accessed by ''gates'': "thin" places between the dimensions that can be pierced in a number of ways. ''Porteurs'' are psi-talented persons who can open the link. The Porvone Portal of Light and the Slikketer Window are two devices which can also open the link. In some of the novels, the character "The Contessa" is searching for or has developed an electronic device that can also open the links.  The novels include:

=== Television ===
*In '' [[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'' teleportation via the use of [[quantum entanglement]] is utilized several times in the series, although there are certain restrictions to its functionality, such as being in the vicinity of a black hole. The first time the device is employed, it is used to send Dylan Hunt back to his own time to try to bring his fiancée back with him. The attempt fails, and Dylan returns to the ''Andromeda'' alone. Later, when Dylan is trapped near another black hole, Harper (one of the inventors of the device) attempts to use it to retrieve him but is unable to do so.
* The 1970s BBC science television series ''[[Blake's 7]]'' featured a 'teleporter' on the spaceship ''[[Liberator (Blake's 7)|Liberator]]''. It required the teleportee to wear a bracelet for transport to and from the spaceship: misplacing a bracelet while away from ''Liberator'' was a plot device used from time to time in the series. Teleport Bracelets worked because they contained an alloy known as Aquatar. Teleportation was a known technology to the Federation (the oppressive interstellar regime in power), however it seldom worked and never worked on living matter. As such the Alien teleport technology of the liberator gave the rebel crew of the ''Liberator'' a technological advantage throughout the series. Likewise, the ship used in the final series, ''[[Scorpio (Blake's 7)|Scorpio]]'' had a teleport system using bracelets. Initially it was only semi-complete by the ship's original owner, and from time to time had 'teething' problems in early episodes of the season.
* The series ''[[Charmed]]'' showed many ways of magical teleportation, by both evil and good sides. [[Whitelighter]]s and half whitelighters have the ability to "orb", while Elders have the ability to orb themselves and/or other people separately.  Some demons and warlocks have the ability to "blink" or "shimmer", while higher level demons and [[The Source (Charmed)|The Source]] can teleport in and out with various techniques.  There is no significant difference between the various teleportation methods, except for the type of special effect used to portray it on the screen.
* The longest BBC [[sci-fi]] television series, ''[[Doctor Who]]'' featured a number of teleportation devices over the years. The first occurrence is in a 1964 story, "[[The Keys of Marinus]]", which shows watch-like "travel dials" allowing instant transportation from one chosen location to another on the planet Marinus.  An interplanetary form of teleportation called "molecular dissemination" is shown in the 1965 episode "[[The Daleks' Master Plan|Counter Plot]]."  In stories featuring Earth or human colonies, this mode of travel is most frequently referred to as a "transmat". Transmat (or T-Mat) technology is central to the plot of "[[The Seeds of Death]]" (1969), in which Martian [[Ice Warrior]]s attempt to use Earth's mid-21st century T-Mat network to distribute a biological weapon around the globe. [[Time Lords]] are said to have "transcended" transmat technology when (in their words) the "universe was half its present size".
*  One of the technologies that the alien Taelons bring to Earth in ''[[Earth: Final Conflict]]'' is the ability to create interdimensional (ID) portals, which allow instant transportation between any two points on the planet. The technology is also used to allow their starships to go faster than light. ID portal stations are set up across the world to allow humans to go anywhere they want. One wealthy industrialist is known to have a personal ID portal set up in her limousine. One episode also deals with the development of a teleporter, which functions differently from an ID portal, being similar to ''[[Star Trek]]'''s version. The device is developed by a human scientist and is used by him to assassinate a number of prominent Taelons by teleporting mini-bombs inside them. The device is destroyed at the end of the episode, but several others have obtained enough readings to start their own research into the phenomenon.
* In the ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'' episode "[[White Tulip]]", [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] [[astrophysics]] professor Alistair Peck ([[Peter Weller]]) is experimenting on his own body to convert himself into a time machine to travel back in time to see his fiancée, who was killed in a car accident several months before. He travels back to a train; this causes the train, and the passengers to be drained of power. When Fringe Division fails to stop him, he starts the time loop again. The second time, Walter volunteers to try and stop him alone. During their meeting, Walter shares his belief that ever since he took Peter from the parallel world, [[God]] may be punishing him and is looking for forgiveness in the form of a white tulip. After Peck escapes, he is able to accomplish traveling back to his fiancée and reunites with her, before they both die in the car crash. The events of the episode never took place, but Walter is seen writing a letter to Peter about his origins, but later burns it upon finishing. In the end, he receives a letter from Peck, which contains a simple drawing of a white tulip, telling Walter to forgive himself. Additionally, Walter Bishop has developed a working space-time teleportation device, although it is revealed that there are bugs that Walter never resolved. The device is used to get David Robert Jones out of prison, but, as a side effect, he appears to be partially out of phase with normal reality, which is slowly killing him but does allow him to survive being shot at.
* In ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'', the "Phoenix Gate" — a gold and [[lapis lazuli]]-colored, small shield-like enchanted metal talisman, containing a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] within it, is used by [[Demona]], [[Goliath (Gargoyles)|Goliath]], [[David Xanatos]] and a few other key characters in the mid-1990s-aired Disney animated series for time travel across the Earth to various locales, activated with the spoken spell ''"Deslagrate muri tempi et intervalia!"'', the Latin phrase for "burn down the walls of space and time".
* In the [[NBC]] [[drama]] ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', the characters [[Hiro Nakamura]], [[Peter Petrelli]] and [[Arthur Petrelli]] have the "power to bend the spacetime continuum", which enables them to teleport and travel through time while ''[[Heroes Evolutions]]'' characters Tracy Chobham and Manuel Garcia can only teleport.
* In ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series]]'', As [[Dr. Jacques von Hämsterviel]] is in a jail cell on a desert asteroid (his cell being secretly decked out with various lab equipment that he can hide from prison guards by voice command), his experiment bounty hunter, [[Gantu]], must send any experiments he captures to him via "molecular teleportation." As seen in the [[Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series|series]] and the [[Stitch! The Movie|movie that started it]], molecular teleportation consists of a large glass container lowering down over the object for transport. When the teleporter is charged, a swirling, yellow flash of light and smoke surrounds the object before it disappears in a flash. Another such flash of light and smoke appears in the destination teleporter where the object reappears. The glass enclosure on these teleporters are an absolute necessity as opening them will automatically cancel a teleport.
* Teleportation occurs in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] drama ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', in which it is closely linked to time travel. The character [[Benjamin Linus]] is teleported off the island after turning an ancient wooden wheel buried in a frozen chamber. He ends up in the Tunisian desert eight months in the future. The character of [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]] undergoes a similar experience when he pushes the aforementioned wheel back onto its axis. Also, the characters of [[Hugo "Hurley" Reyes]], [[Jack Shephard]], [[Kate Austen]] and [[Sayid Jarrah]] are teleported off Ajira Airways flight 316 in 2007, ending up back on the island in the year 1977.
* From ''[[Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers]]'' to ''[[Power Rangers Lost Galaxy]]'', the Power Rangers were capable of teleportation. A similar concept appeared in an episode of ''[[Power Rangers Ninja Storm]]''. In ''[[Power Rangers Mystic Force]]'', the Rangers could teleport through the trees. Also, in ''[[Power Rangers RPM]]'', Ranger Green's special ability is teleportation.
* Pop-culture awareness of the teleportation concept was influenced by the numerous ''[[Star Trek]]'' television and theatrical film series (beginning in 1964 with the original TV series pilot episode, "[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]") that was originally created by television writer-producer [[Gene Roddenberry]], primarily as a work-around for the prohibitively expensive visual effects required to depict a star-ship landing on a new planet every week. The transporter effect was achieved by a simple fade-out of the subject with a few cents' worth of glitter thrown in, a much cheaper alternative. The teleportation of ''Star Trek'' is likely the most widely recognized fictional teleportation:{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} the "[[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]]" device, which is used to teleport people and things from ship to ship or from ship to planet and the other way around in an instant. Persons or non-living items are placed on the transporter pad and are dismantled particle by particle by a beam, with their atoms being patterned in a computer buffer and converted into a beam that is directed toward the destination, then reassembled back into their original form (usually with no mistakes). Site-to-site transportation is also possible, where the subject does not need to be on a transporter pad at the source, or at the destination. However, there are a few accounts of groups of teleportees being fused together by a scrambled beam, transported to alternate universes, leaving copies of themselves behind, and similar mishaps. In the [[Star Trek (film)|rebooted film]], with some help from the future, [[Scotty (Star Trek)|Scotty]] develops a new type of transporter that allows him to beam from a planet to a starship, while the latter is at warp. The technology is quickly confiscated by Starfleet for fear of its misuse but is used in ''Star Trek Into Darkness'' by the villain to escape from Earth all the way to the [[Klingon]] homeworld of Qo'noS (located about 90 light years away).
* The most obvious instance of teleportation in the ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' universe is the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] itself, along with the intergalactic network of similar devices. Going by the dialogue of the series, the Stargate forms an artificial wormhole between two Gates. Travelers are then disassembled by the originating Gate, transferred as a matter stream with reassembly instructions to the receiving Gate, which then reassembles them upon arrival. Another prominent teleportation system is implemented between two ring platforms. Each ring platform has five rings which elevate around the transported objects and swap the contents between the two ring platforms. However, there have been some instances of using a ring transporter to teleport objects short distances having a single platform perform both the disassembly and assembly, ascending or descending in between. It is noted in the series that the ring teleporter technology is related to the Stargate technology, although the rings have limited range as they do not utilize wormholes. An alien race called the Aschen is also shown to have developed teleportation platforms that act as public transportation hubs. They do not appear to use rings. Later in the series, an alien race known as the [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]] use a method similar to many other science fiction depictions of teleportation. This method does not require teleportation apparatus on either end. The series finale of ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' introduces an experimental faster-than-light drive called the wormhole drive, which appears to function similar to a stargate, except it does not require the ship (or, in this case, an entire flying city) to go through a gate. Usage of the drive is stated to be extremely risky and has a high degree of probability of destroying the ship, but it does allow the ship to cross half the galaxy in moments.
* ''[[The Tomorrow People]],'' a television series first made in the mid-1970s and then re-made into a modern, ''[[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]'' program incorporated psychic teleportation or "jaunting" as a [[psionic]] gift bestowed upon a group of random teenagers.
* ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' introduced a character named [[Skywarp]], a member of the [[Decepticon]] Air Force called the [[Seeker (Transformers)|Seekers]], who was capable of teleporting from place to place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Transformers: Identification and Price Guide |page=32 |author=Mark Bellomo |year=2007 |quote="...Skywarp was famous for his ability to teleport at will across great distances...."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transformers also utilize a device called a "Space Bridge" to travel, usually from Cybertron to a planet in another solar system. Some Transformers like the ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]'' iteration of [[Jetfire]] carry onboard Space Bridges.
* There is a [[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]] episode called ''[[Valley of the Shadow]]'' in which the main character is teleported and told not to reveal the secrets of teleportation by the inhabitants, who feel that the invention will be misused and destroy humanity.
* [[Wizards of Waverly Place]]. In this show, all of the wizards have the same teleportation technique. They teleport with a flash and it looks like they're sucked into a little light, as smoke appears after them.
* ''[[X-Men]]'' ''[[X-Men (TV series)]]'', ''[[X-Men: Evolution]], ''[[X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men]]'' and ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)]]''.

In the cartoon series based on the [[Marvel Comics]] superheroes of the same name, the character [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] exhibits a mutagenic ability to teleport himself and other objects he touches. The process causes a flash of flame and a sulfurous stink at the start and destination co-cords.
*In the 2018-2019 live television show of ''[[Impulse (TV series)|Impulse]]'', sixteen-year-old Henrietta Coles discovers her extraordinary ability to involuntarily teleport over long distances after being assaulted by a fellow high school student named Clay Boon. However, she has no control over her destination as of yet; the ability of which is triggered only by intense stress and fear. It is revealed that she had inherited this spatial ability from her missing father, who had been abducted by a fellow teleporter several years ago. In other countries, several other people are shown to possess this same ability but have learned to develop it more and have gained greater control over it.

=== Films ===
* A short-distance teleportation device (used instead of [[elevator]]s) appeared in the 1939 [[serial film]] ''[[Buck Rogers (serial)|Buck Rogers]]''.
* In the ''[[Doom (film)|Doom]]'' film, based on the video game series of the same name, a teleportation machine used to move between Earth and Mars would not always work. One of the characters has half of his body teleported to Mars and the other half somewhere else in the galaxy.
* In the ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]'' film based on the children's book ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' by Roald Dahl, the character Mike Teavee is teleported through the airwaves above the heads of the other characters, before reappearing in a device resembling a TV screen on the other side of the room. Moments before, the teleportation device was demonstrated by teleporting a giant bar of chocolate through the air and onto the screen, re-materialising as a regular-sized bar, having shrunk considerably. Mike also re-materialises at a fraction of his original size.
* Teleportation booths called "evaporators" feature in the 1953 [[Merrie Melodies]] [[Animated cartoon|cartoon]] ''[[Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century]]'', a [[Buck Rogers]] [[parody]] starring [[Daffy Duck]]''.
*''[[The Fly (1958 film)|The Fly]]'' was adapted from the short story of the same name by George Langelaan. It features a scientist who has been working on a matter transporter device called the disintegrator-integrator. He initially tests it only on small inanimate objects, but eventually proceeds to living creatures, including the family's pet cat (which fails to reintegrate) and a guinea pig. After he is satisfied that these tests are succeeding, he builds a man-sized pair of chambers. His experiment goes horribly wrong when he tries to transport himself: a fly is caught in the chamber with him, resulting in a mixing of their atoms to make a half-man, half-fly.
* ''[[Galaxy Quest]]'', as a parody of ''Star Trek'', also features teleportation, including an incident when the device is improperly used, causing a test animal to expire messily.
* In ''[[Jumper (2008 film)|Jumper]]'', a genetic abnormality allows a young man, by the name of David Rice, to teleport himself anywhere by gravitationally creating a wormhole. He discovers this gift has existed for centuries and finds himself in a war that has been raging for thousands of years between "Jumpers" and "Paladins" who have sworn to wipe them from the face of the earth, believing that only God should possess the ability.
* ''[[Logan's Run (film)|Logan’s Run]]'' features a teleportation network called “the circuit”, where people can bring over volunteers to choose from in order to have sex with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Virtel |first=Louis |url=http://www.movieline.com/2011/08/bad-movies-we-love-logans-run.php |title=Bad Movies We Love: Logan’s Run |publisher=Movieline |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Not of This Earth (1957 film)|Not Of This Earth]]''. The 1957 film, directed by [[Roger Corman]], features an alien teleportation mechanism.
* In ''[[They Live]]'' a nameless drifter referred to as "Nada" discovers that the ruling class of Earth are in fact aliens concealing their appearance and manipulating people with subliminal messages in mass media. Teleportation is their chief mode of transport, which is used either as a wristwatch for shorter distances, or on a platform in an underground station which beams out into space (for longer distances).
* The 2nd and 3rd installments of the ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' movie franchise (''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' and ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'') feature characters from the [[Marvel Universe]], including the character [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], who exhibits a mutagenic ability to teleport himself and other objects he touches. In ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', the character of [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)|John Wraith]] has a similar ability. In ''[[X-Men: First Class|X-Men First Class]]'' there is a mutant named [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]] who has the ability to teleport.

=== Video games ===
{{Main|warp (gaming)}}
* ''[[Achron]]''. In this real-time strategy game, players may not only build teleporters, which can teleport units anywhere within a certain radius from the machine, but also chronoporters, which teleport units through time.
* Within the [[Massively Multiplayer Online Game]], ''[[Anarchy Online]]'', all characters have the ability to use a "Whoompa" to teleport instantly to a destination listed above the doorway. This type of teleportation is limited to the planet Rubi-Ka. However, in the Shadowlands a character may teleport instantly to a "garden" using "Insignias" on certain statues. (e.g. Thrak, Enel, Shere)
* In  ''[[Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura]]'', a [[Role-playing video game]], magical characters may learn a Teleport spell, which enables instant travel to areas the player character has visited before. This enables easy and fast access to all areas of the continent, including areas otherwise inaccessible after certain plot events.
* ''[[Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth]]'' features mystical transdimensional gates. Often found in deep caverns.
* ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'' features a teleportation device in the maps "Kino Der Toten" and "Five". In Kino Der Toten, the teleporter can be linked from the mainframe to the pad and is free to use. In "Five", there are many teleporters that emit a reddish glow and teleport the character to other teleporters. There is a main teleporter that activates once the DEFCON level is increased. Once activated, it teleports the player to the Pack A Punch room.
* ''[[Call of Duty: World at War]]'' features a teleportation device in its [[Call of Duty: World at War#Downloadable content|Map Pack 3]] [[Call of Duty World at War: Zombie Mode|zombie mode]] in a map known as ''Der Riese''. The DLC features three teleporters which are supposedly activated by a mainframe and costs 1500 points to use.
* ''[[City of Heroes]]'' and its sister game ''[[City of Villains]]'' allow player characters to learn teleportation powers at levels 6, 14, and 20.  These begin with the ability to teleport foes short distances to a location near the player or the ability to teleport group members to the player's current location from hundreds of meters away.  Later powers allow player characters to teleport themselves and nearby allies more than a hundred meters at a time. Within the game setting, there is said to be a teleport grid running throughout the city that is used mainly to transport injured characters to a medical facility. Supergroups (the in-game term for a [[guild]] or [[clan]]) can also construct teleport pads which, after they obtain the beacon for a zone, can be used to travel directly there from their base.
* In the computer video game ''[[Diablo II]]'' and the Diablo II Expansion Pack, the Sorceress character is able to develop a teleportation skill and speed through levels through development of an ability.
* In the ''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'' series, the UAC's experiments with teleportation technology provide a way for [[demon]]s from [[Hell]] to enter our universe. Teleportation devices are also used to transport the protagonist between positions on various maps.
* The first two games of the [[EarthBound (series)|''EarthBound'' series]], ''[[Mother (video game)|Mother]]'' and ''[[EarthBound]]'' respectively, the main characters could use [[Psionics|PSI]] to teleport to any location they'd previously been. The action appears to involve running at accelerating speeds with an accompanying whirring sound before the actual teleportation takes place. The third game of the series, ''[[Mother 3]]'', does not have the teleportation power, likely due to the much smaller overall setting.
* In ''[[Fable (2004 video game)|Fable]]'', the Hero can teleport using the Guild Seal. Although he can teleport from anywhere, he must teleport to a preset teleportation pad.
* ''[[Global Agenda]]'', a science-fiction based [[online role-playing game]], allows the player to travel between set locations via teleporters. One type of teleporter appears in the main game world, where they serve as a one-way trip back to a settlement. Another type, also one-way, is used in multiplayer matches, where the entrance is placed in the team's spaceship and the exit can be carried into the field by players. Once placed, respawning players can use the teleport to instantly get back into the fight, saving valuable time and allowing the team to keep the pressure up even when losing. The teleporter exit can be destroyed by enemy agents in order to gain an advantage.
* In the [[online role-playing game]] ''[[Guild Wars]]'', one can use the short-range transporters in the Crystal Desert.  One simply steps on the pad, observes the lighting sequence of the four (4) crystals, and then touches them in the same order to activate the teleporter. In addition to this, all players can instantly teleport to any previously visited town or outpost at any point in the game, this is called "maptravel" by both the manual and in-game characters.
* In the computer game ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', Gordon Freeman's experiment goes wrong, causing aliens to teleport to our world. In the sequel, ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', teleportation devices are used to move Gordon and other characters to different locations. What little is explained about these devices regards [[Quantum Entanglement]] or [[Quantum superposition|Superposition]].
* In the [[Halo series|''Halo'' series]], the teleporters appear as glowing columns of green or orange. The player can walk into these columns and be instantly teleported. The titular ring-shaped artificial worlds also house teleportation systems that can be used for instantaneous transport from anywhere to anywhere within the system's range.
* In ''Kingdom Hearts'', members of Organization XIII can teleport using the Corridors of Darkness.
* In the ''Kirby'' series, many [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]] have the ability to teleport.
* In [[the Legend of Zelda (series)|the ''Legend of Zelda'']] series, several forms of teleportation appear. It first appeared in the first game, where, upon playing the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|Recorder]], a whirlwind would appear that could take the protagonist [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] to any previous dungeon. It later appeared in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'', where Link is teleported back to the beginning of the dungeon after beating the final boss. He later also acquires a magical spell that allows him to teleport to earlier set locations inside dungeons, and also magical songs that allow him to teleport to several set locations in the overworld. In later games, similar forms of teleportation return. For example, in [[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]], Link uses his Wind Waker to conduct a melody that will summon a waterspout that will carry him to any one of set locations that he chooses, somewhat similar to the aforementioned whirlwind from the first game. Another game is [[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]. In this game, [[Midna]] can teleport Link to any of the fixed locations on the map.
* The [[Marathon series|''Marathon'' series]] features teleportation technology as both a speedy means of local travel that moves the player between levels and as the fastest method of [[faster-than-light]] travel.
* [[Super Mario (series)|''Super Mario'']] features pipes linking to treasure rooms within a level. They are portals insofar as no travel through a pipe system is shown, providing near instantaneous translocation. Pipe endings are featured throughout every level, but only a few of them are usable (without indicator). Being a 'jump and run' game, a pipe can be used simply by moving in direction of flow when standing on its opening.
* In the [[Mega Man (original series)|''Mega Man'']] series and its spinoffs, many robots (including the titular character) have built-in teleportation devices, and booth-style teleporters also exist. The phenomenon is depicted as a streak of colored light (colored the same as the character). The start of each level in the games usually involves the player character teleporting onto the screen, and later teleporting out of the area again once it has been completed.
* The first ''Metroid Prime'' features the Chozo Temple, which near the end of the game becomes the site of a glowing portal to the Impact Crater. The main character Samus can step into the circle and be instantly transported into the hollow core of the meteor that crashed there. In ''Prime 2: Echoes'', when Samus obtains the Light Suit, she can step into beams of golden light to teleport to secret areas, or temple Energy Converters. Pirate Commandos appear to teleport in combat at first, but they are later revealed to travel via an alternate dimension instead, making the travel take just as long as it would have otherwise. The benefit then comes not from instant travel, but from being invisible to and unable to be harmed by their target as they move. Said alternate dimension is a parallel world that the main character can travel to via rifts in spacetime. In the final part of the trilogy, ''Corruption'', there is a single teleporter on planet Bryyo. Stepping into it transports Samus to a hidden site at the opposite side of the planet in a flash of light. Some creatures in the game, such as Warp Hounds and Pirate Commandos, are able to teleport through their own power and technology. Leviathans can open wormholes, which have a similar effect, except that they allow multiple beings, objects and space ships to pass through at once.
* ''Outbreak''. The origin of the original [[outbreak]] in this [[Massively Multiplayer Online Game]] is a teleportation experiment gone awry.
* In ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' a character named Tracer has an ability called Blink where she can teleport in the distance and Recall, an ability to travel in time 3 seconds earlier in her reality. Symmentra has an ultimate ability called "teleporter" where she can place anywhere in the map where she can teleport her and her teammates to the area she placed on the spawn.
* In the ''[[Pokémon]]'' series, stepping on warp tiles will teleport the player to another warp tile, or in some cases, a regular tile. Also, in ''Pokémon Platinum'', the player teleports into [[Giratina]]'s world willingly. Some Pokémon are able to learn the move "Teleport"', which esacpes from a battle or sends the player to the last Pokémon Center visited.
* ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' features an ''Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device'' or the ''ASHPD'' or simply the portal gun. The ASHPD shoots Portals, or linked gateways illustrated as Orange and Blue holes on flat surfaces. Portals effectively function as holes in space. Portals have a unique effect on the laws of physics, allowing the player to fling themselves out of one portal by jumping into its twin from a great height. Infinite hallways and bottomless fall loops are also possible. Teleportation from a great distance is theoretically possible, but not possible during normal gameplay due to material emancipation grids (also called "fizzlers") that clear out any open portals when you pass through them, however, this system is circumvented in Portal 2, where the main character can see the moon through a break in the ceiling. The walls that are capable with portals are covered with a processed form of moon rocks, so the main character shoots a portal onto the floor, then onto the moon, and the vacuum began to suck everything through the portal into space. While the portals themselves appear to acts as faster than light travel (As they are technically wormholes), the wormhole source - when shot from the portal gun - is still bounded by the speed of light. This becomes apparent by the portal taking a short period of time before opening up when shot at the moon. Unlike the 'square head with teeth' portals of ''[[Narbacular Drop]]'' (on which the gameplay of Portal is based) - Portal uses oval form portals.
* ''[[Prey (2006 video game)|Prey]]'' features portals as core gameplay element. Portals transport the player to a great variation of locations. Apart from being used to keep trans-location fresh and interesting, one instance transports the player onto a miniature planet all the while shrinking him to miniature scale. In another instance a portal is used to fit an area the size of a room into a shoebox. Portals are often hidden in odd places such as the backside of cornered objects or even on the ceiling. Many portals are reachable only thru 'spirit vision'. Arrows can be shot thru the portals with the bow. If a portal closes while it is being traversed, its occupant dies of dismemberment.
* In ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake 1]]'' teleportation is used to bridge between levels. The teleporters resemble a door frame and are filled with a surface of wobbling stars. They are called 'Slipgates'. In [[Quake III Arena]] teleporters are used casually as shortcuts and gameplay element. The target of a teleporter being a specific and marked place elsewhere in the map. In the occurrence of a player standing on this very spot when another player uses the teleporter, the player occupying the 'landing zone' explodes into parts when the unwilling aggressor emerges. Indeed, it is through this mechanic that the player defeats the final boss of the first Quake. Additionally a player also has to be careful when using a teleporter, since the target zone can be ridden with anticipatory projectiles. In [[Quake 4]] the teleporter mechanic can also be used to transport projectiles, allowing for greater attack and defense options.
* ''[[Ratchet &amp; Clank]]'' features teleportation as common transportation throughout the series.
* In ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert (series)|Red Alert]]'', the Chronosphere is a mass teleportation super weapon device that can be constructed by the Allies. Once built the weapon charges for several minutes at which time the player can deploy the weapon, teleporting up to 9 vehicles from any point to point on the map. The Chronosphere super weapon instantly kills any targeted biological units and can also be used to dump enemy vehicles in the ocean or destroy enemy naval units by dropping them on land. Units equipped with chrono technology are later developed in the series. Chrono miners can teleport back to the refinery once full. Chronolegionaire can teleport to anywhere, the longer the jump the longer they take to materialise, they can be killed while materialising, there weapon removes the enemy from existence. Albert Einstein was a notable contributor to the Chronosphere's design. 
* Within the [[Massively Multiplayer Online Game]], ''[[RuneScape]]'', teleportation is an important and popular means of transport. Players may use the Magic skill to cast teleportation spells, allowing transport to various cities and locations. With a high Magic level, players can also cast "teleport other" spells on players. All teleport spells require Law runes, along with several other runes depending on the spell; for instance, teleporting to the town of Varrock requires one Law rune, three Air runes and one Fire rune. Various items of enchanted jewellery can, when activated, teleport to certain areas, for instance the ring of dueling, which allows eight teleports to the Duel Arena, before disintegrating. One exception to the spells is the Home Teleport. It does not require any runes but can be interrupted because it is a ritual and needs no experience. There are also a number of quest-related items that allow teleports to various areas, such as the "Enchanted Lyre", which teleports to the province of Rellekka when played, and the "Ectophial", which teleports to the Ectofunctus when emptied. No teleports may be used past level 20 of the Wilderness area, although few items with such an ability can be used up to level 30.
* ''Rogue Galaxy''. Teleport Platforms are a common technology scattered about the solar system. They are a small, blue-and-cream pad with a simple cross-shaped pattern on the pad itself, and a hologram of a large placard with a dog head-shaped rune that, curiously is the same as Jaster's Birthmark, hovering over it. Closer inspection reveals two lines of complex lettering near the top. Only platforms on the current world can be used, there is no interplanetary teleport system. They also contain special equipment that instantly heals and re-fills the AP of the party, and a memory-storage device that allows one to save the game. As the name suggests, they allow instant transport between the currently-occupied pad and whichever pad is chosen.
* Within the [[Massively Multiplayer Online Game]], ''[[Second Life]]'', all avatars (residents), have the ability to teleport. Originally, residents could only teleport from one telehub to another telehub which were located within a cluster of regions (referred to as "sims") and then walk, drive or fly the remaining distance to their destination, but this was later replaced with point-to-point teleportation. The elimination of telehub teleportation had an economic effect on the prices and values of virtual real estate surrounding the telehubs as residents no longer had to pass through, around or over shops and buildings placed next to a telehub. Within the culture of Second Life residents typically shorten the word "teleport" to the letters: TP.
* Once a civilization (regardless of the species that gains sapience) reaches the [[Nanotech Age]] in ''[[SimEarth]]'', it uses transporters to spawn new cities in uncolonized regions instead of using manpower (Stone Age), horses (Bronze and Iron Age), motorized vehicles (Industrial Age), or airplanes (Atomic and Information Age). Also, a Nanotech Age civilization can build their cities on water.
* ''The Sims 2: Apartment Life''. If you meet a witch on a corner you can befriend her and become a witch yourself, after you learn your spells you have an option that can 'teleport' your sim from one location on the screen to another.  This same action happens with repo men and other Sims II NPC's if you should try to lock them out of your house.
* In [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'' series]], [[Shadow the Hedgehog]] can use Chaos Emerald's power called "Chaos Control", when he can teleport himself to the other place. [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] and some other characters and enemies can use the same power. In the stage "Mystic Mansion" on ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'', there are teleporters called "Switch Balls" with symbols on the pad and the ball that can allow players to teleport if they touch it. The active switch ball has glowing symbols on the ball. These will release symbol particles spreading from the pad and the blue light starts to permeate on the middle of the screen. Once teleported to another room in the stage, the switch balls will stop glowing and become inactive. Thus, it cannot be reverted.
*''Starcraft''. Protoss teleport in all equipment and field bases from factories on Aiur. Terrans also have an experimental teleporter, which they use to supply inaccessible military stations, such as the Jacob's Installation. In Starcraft 2, the Protoss have refined their technology even further, allowing teleportation of soldiers anywhere on their power grid once the Gateway is upgraded to the Warp Gate structure, and their Stalker mechs can "blink" to escape untenable situations.
* ''Street Fighter''. The Indian character Dhalsim utilizes teleportation as a special move called "Yoga Teleport" to evade attacks from opponents.
* ''[[Tabula Rasa (video game)|Tabula Rasa]]'' features waypoint pads which operate as teleportation booths between any two previously explored waypoints within one zone, and wormhole portals which send characters from one planet to another instantly. Dropships (sometimes known as hedgehogs) which can be used to move between zones and are also seen dropping troops into the field employ a teleport system similar to the waypoint pads to store and carry their passengers and cargo. Also used are portable wormhole generators which allow a player to access the waypoint pad system from remote areas.
* ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'''s engineer class can build a teleporter that enables his team to travel faster and less conspicuously to the frontlines. It can be upgraded through three levels, with each upgrade decreasing the amount of time needed to recharge between uses. The teleporter consists of an entrance pad and an exit pad placed flat on the ground, meaning that teleportation is a one-way ride (although during Mann Vs Machine matches, the engineer can purchase a 2-way teleporter from an upgrade station). The teleportation itself happens instantly, with the teleporting person disappearing and reappearing in a flash of yellow light bursting from the teleport pads. If the person can see the entrance from where the exit lies, they will be able to view a silhouette of themselves dissolve into colored sparks that drop to the ground and disappear. The teleport devices are capable of functioning perfectly even when severely damaged, but destroying either of them completely will break the teleportation link. If a person passes through the teleport when someone else is already standing on the exit, the latter will be killed instantly ("[[Frag (video gaming)|telefragged]]") by the other materializing inside them. The teleporting person is not harmed by this.
* In ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]'' the Mages' Guild transport systems are instantaneous travels (''i.e. with no lapse in in-game time'') between two locations, more specifically between two Mages' Guilds. The game also features a range of spells such as 'Mark' and 'Recall', 'Divine Intervention', and 'Almsivi Intervention' which teleport the player to specific places. In ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' the Wizard's Tower plugin gives the players access to teleporter pads to each of the Mages' Guild Halls in the game. These pads teleport the player from Frostcrag Spire to the particular Guild Halls.
*''Ultima'' series. ''Ultima Online'', in addition to a short-range ''teleport'' spell, features a pair of spells called ''mark'' and ''recall''. ''Mark'' is cast on a rune, marking it with the spellcaster's location; a spellcaster can then return to that location by casting ''recall'' on the rune. Another spell, ''gate travel'', can also be cast on a rune but creates a temporary portal instead. ''Ultima 7'' features a similar system. Most Ultimas feature a system of permanent but intermittent portals called moongates whose location and destination depend on the phase of the world's two moons. In some there is a spell to open a gate whose destination likewise depends on the phase of the moons, and/or an Orb of the Moons which opens a moongate to various locations. ''Ultima Online'''s moongates are always present and can transport the user to any other moongate at any time.
* In ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'' and its sequels, teleports exist to allow the players to traverse the map. Also, in some game types, the option exists to give each player a handheld device called a Translocator; this device, as a primary fire mode, fires a small disc to which the player can then teleport, as a secondary fire mode. It can be used with some skill to [[telefrag]] opponents by teleporting within the enemy character model when the destination disc is close enough.
* Within the [[MMORPG]] ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', characters can use an object called a "Hearthstone" to teleport the character to an inn to which the hearthstone is set. Characters can change the inn to which they "hearth" (as it is often called in-game) by visiting another inn and asking an innkeeper to make that inn their home.Users can also create trinkets to teleport them to the regions of Tanaris, Winterspring, Netherstorm, Blade's Edge Mountains, and most Northrend areas through the use of the "Engineering" profession. Various "mishaps" can happen, including temporary gender or race change, arriving dead or even ending up on a floating rock high above Area 52 (Netherstorm). Some classes have the ability to teleport to certain places, for example, Druids can teleport to Moonglade by use of an ability. Mages can create portals to capital cities that everyone in the party can access.  Also mages can teleport themselves to the capital cities.Warlocks can summon others with the help of group members. Meeting stones now work like warlocks summoning spells, without the use of a soul shard. Rogues also have a form of teleportation, Shadow step, an ability that makes the rogue appear behind an enemy.

=== Comics ===
* The ''[[Dan Dare]]'' adventures in the ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'' used a "telesender", originally invented by the [[Treens]].  A running joke was that Dan Dare's assistant Digby always arrived upside down.  Its first appearance was in ''Voyage to Venus'', published in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Daniel | last=Tatarsky | title=Dan Dare: the biography | publisher=Orion Books | isbn=978-0-7528-8896-5 | pages=173–174 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[DC Comics]] also has many teleporters, including [[Zatanna]], [[Misfit (DC Comics)|Misfit]], [[Darkseid]], [[Ambush Bug]], [[Angle Man]], [[Manitou Raven]], [[Bolt (DC Comics)|Bolt]], [[Chronos (comics)|Chronos]], [[Dr. Fate]], [[La Encantadora]], [[Gog (DC Comics)|Gog]], and [[Hourman (android)|Hourman]].  There is also a way for non-teleporters to travel called the [[Boom Tube]].  [[The Flash]] has also "teleported" into parallel universes by vibrating at a very high frequency. Additionally, the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'s lunar [[Justice League Watchtower|Watchtower]] contained banks of teleportation tubes based on principally Martian technology.
* Published by [[Gold Key Comics]], the mid-1960s science fiction war comic ''[[M.A.R.S. Patrol Total War]]'' featured an unknown invader who used teleportation to attack various spots on the Earth.
* The [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic books feature many [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] and other characters with teleportation powers, such as  [[Azazel (Marvel comics)|Azazel]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Magik (comics)|Magik]], [[Locus (comics)|Locus]], [[Lila Cheney]], [[Amanda Sefton]], [[Madelyne Pryor]], [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], [[Wink (Marvel Comics)|The Wink]], [[Paragon (comics)|Paragon]], [[Silver Samurai]], [[Eden Fesi]] and dozens of others. In ''Fantastic Four'' #65 (August 1967), Ronan the Accuser, a member of the alien race the Kree, uses a device to teleport himself from an orbiting spaceship to a street in New York City. The character [[Spot (comics)|Spot]] can open holes he can teleport himself or even parts of himself through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark |first=Brian |url=http://www.movieline.com/2010/10/5-villains-that-would-be-cooler-than-the-lizard-in-spider-man-reboot.php |title=5 Villains That Would Be Cooler Than the Lizard in the Spider-Man Reboot |publisher=Movieline |date=2010-10-14 |accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Several different forms of spacetime ''jutsu'' (technique) appear in the [[Naruto Shippuden]] [[manga]]. Those include teleporting one's self, teleporting objects or humans, and adjusting time to teleport. Those techniques have names such as ''Kamui'' for teleporting objects/humans, ''Summoning'' when teleporting an animal to one's location, and ''Flying Thunder God'' when teleporting one self to where a teleporting seal is located (mainly used by the "Yellow Flash").
* The main protagonist, [[Goku]], learns from an alien species on how to teleport across the universe in the manga / anime series [[Dragon Ball]]. The technique was coined, "Instant Transmission" (瞬間移動, ''Shunkan Idō'', lit. Instant Movement), where Goku would focus his index and middle finger together towards his forehead and concentrate on a location he could sense through clairvoyant means through the practice of Qi Gong/Ki that is prevalent in the Dragon Ball universe. It was taught to Goku when he was on Planet Yardrat after his deadly battle with [[Frieza]] on Planet Namek. In addition to Goku, the upper Gods called [[King Kai|Kais]] are also capable of performing an upgraded form of instant transmission. Moreover, many antagonists like [[Android Cell|Cell]] and [[Majin Buu]] learned to do it as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1624">In [[crystallography]], a '''Wyckoff position''' is a point belonging to a set of points for which site [[symmetry group]]s are conjugate [[subgroup]]s of the [[space group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Lev. Kantorovich | title =  Quantum Theory of the Solid State: An Introduction | publisher = Springer | page = 28 | url = https://www.springer.com/west/home/materials?SGWID=4-10041-22-33589604-0 | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crystallography tables give the Wyckoff positions for different space groups.

Wyckoff positions are used in calculations of [[crystal]] properties.  There are two types of positions: general and special.  
*General positions are left invariant only for the identity operation (''E'').  Each space group has only one general position.  
*Special positions are left invariant by the identity operation and at least one other operation of the space group.

The Wyckoff positions are named after [[Ralph Walter Graystone Wyckoff]], an American X-ray crystallographer who authored several books in the field. His 1922 book, The Analytical Expression of the Results of the Theory of Space Groups, contained tables with the positional coordinates, both general and special, permitted by the symmetry elements. This book was the forerunner of International Tables for X-ray Crystallography, which first appeared in 1935.
