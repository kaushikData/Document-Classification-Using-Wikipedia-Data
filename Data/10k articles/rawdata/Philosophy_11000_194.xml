==Biography==

===Youth and education===
Abdus Salam was born to Chaudhry Muhammad Hussain and Hajira Hussain, into a [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[Muslim]] family that was part of the [[Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam]]. In terms of caste-affiliation, they were [[Jat]]s of [[Rajput]] descent from Jhang on his father's side while his mother was a [[Kakazai]] from Gurdaspur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Aziz | first = [[Khursheed Kamal Aziz|Khursheed Kamal]] | title = The Coffee House of Lahore, a Memoir 1942–57 | publisher = Sang-e-Meel Publications| edition = First| date = March 2008 | pages = 200 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mSnnnAAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Khursheed+Kamal+Aziz%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj058vk2NzVAhVs7oMKHViMBfE4ChDoAQg0MAM | isbn = 9693520939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Fraser, ''Cosmic Anger: Abdus Salam – The First Muslim Nobel Scientist'', OUP Oxford (2008), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dawn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://herald.dawn.com/news/1153774|title=I was born a Pakistani and I’ll die a Pakistani: Abdus Salam|work=[[Dawn News]]|date=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, Gul Muhammad, was a religious scholar as well as a physician&lt;ref name="kibble98"/&gt; while his father was an education officer in the Department of Education of [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab State]] in a poor farming district.

Salam very early established a reputation throughout the Punjab and later at the University of Cambridge for outstanding brilliance and academic achievement. At age 14, Salam scored the highest marks ever recorded for the matriculation (entrance) examination at the [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=59–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won a full scholarship to the [[Government College, Lahore|Government College University]] of [[Lahore]], [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=78–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salam was a versatile scholar, interested in [[Urdu literature|Urdu]] and [[British literature|English literature]] in which he excelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Murthi|1999|pp=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he soon picked up Mathematics as his concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Murthi|1999|pp=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salam's mentor and tutors wanted him to become an English teacher, but Salam decided to stick with Mathematics&lt;ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan, Former Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, former Head of the Nuclear Engineering Division, and former Head of the Reactor Engineering IAEA Division "&gt;{{cite journal

During his doctoral studies, his mentors challenged him to solve within one year an intractable problem which had defied such great minds as [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] and [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]].&lt;ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan, Former Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, former Head of the Nuclear Engineering Division, and former Head of the Reactor Engineering IAEA Division "/&gt; Within six months, Salam had found a solution for the renormalisation of meson theory. As he proposed the solution at the Cavendish Laboratory, Salam had attracted the attention of [[Hans Bethe|Bethe]], [[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]] and Dirac.&lt;ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan, Former Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, former Head of the Nuclear Engineering Division, and former Head of the Reactor Engineering IAEA Division "/&gt;

===Academic career===

After receiving his doctorate in 1951, Salam returned to Lahore at the [[Government College University, Lahore|Government College University]] as a Professor of Mathematics where he remained till 1954. In 1952, he was appointed professor and Chair of the Department of Mathematics at the neighbouring University of the Punjab. In the latter capacity, Salam sought to update the university curriculum, introducing a course in [[Quantum mechanics]] as a part of the undergraduate curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Fayyazuddin|2005|pp=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this initiative was soon reverted by the Vice-Chancellor, and Salam decided to teach an evening course in Quantum Mechanics outside the regular curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Fayyazuddin|2005|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Salam enjoyed a mixed popularity in the university, he began to supervise the education of students who were particularly influenced by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Fayyazuddin|2005|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Riazuddin remained the only student of Salam who had the privilege to study under Salam at the undergraduate and post-graduate level in Lahore, and [[Postdoctoral research|post-doctoral]] level in Cambridge University. In 1953, Salam was unable to establish a research institute in Lahore, as he faced strong opposition from his peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=237–238}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, Salam took fellowship and became one of the earliest [[Fellow of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences|fellows of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences]]. As a result of [[1953 Lahore riots]], Salam went back to Cambridge and joined [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], and took a position as a professor of mathematics in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Duff|2007|pp=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1957, he was invited to take a chair at [[Imperial College, London]], and he and [[Paul Taunton Matthews|Paul Matthews]] went on to set up the Theoretical Physics Department at Imperial College.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Duff|2007|pp=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; As time passed, this department became one of the prestigious research departments that included well known physicists such as [[Steven Weinberg]], [[Tom W. B. Kibble|Tom Kibble]], [[Gerald Guralnik]], [[C. R. Hagen]], [[Riazuddin (physicist)|Riazuddin]], and [[John Clive Ward|John Ward]].
[[File:St. John's College, Cambridge University.jpg|thumb|[[St John's College, Cambridge]] where Salam studied.]]
In 1957, Punjab University conferred Salam with an [[Honorary degree|Honorary doctorate]] for his contribution in Particle physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Duff|2007|pp=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year with help from his mentor, Salam launched a scholarship programme for his students in Pakistan. Salam retained strong links with Pakistan, and visited his country from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Duff|2007|pp=iix}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Cambridge and Imperial College he formed a group of theoretical physicists, the majority of whom were his Pakistani students. At age 33, Salam became one of the youngest persons to be elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1959|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1959]].&lt;ref name="kibble98" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kibble98" /&gt; Salam took a fellowship at the [[Princeton University]] in 1959, where he met with [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=239–240}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to whom he presented his research work on neutrinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=241–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oppenheimer and Salam discussed the foundation of electrodynamics, problems and their solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; His dedicated personal assistant was Jean Bouckley. In 1980, Salam became a foreign fellow of the [[Bangladesh Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Scientific career===
Early in his career, Salam made an important and significant contribution in [[quantum electrodynamics]] and [[quantum field theory]], including its extension into [[Particle physics|particle]] and [[nuclear physics]]. In his early career in Pakistan, Salam was greatly interested in mathematical series and their relation to physics. Salam had played an influential role in the advancement of nuclear physics, but he maintained and dedicated himself to mathematics and theoretical physics and focused Pakistan to do more research in theoretical physics.&lt;ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan, Former Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, former Head of the Nuclear Engineering Division, and former Head of the Reactor Engineering IAEA Division"/&gt; However, he regarded nuclear physics (nuclear fission and nuclear power) as a non-pioneering part of physics as it had already "happened".&lt;ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan, Former Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, former Head of the Nuclear Engineering Division, and former Head of the Reactor Engineering IAEA Division "/&gt; Even in Pakistan, Salam was the leading driving force in theoretical physics in Pakistan, with many scientists he continued to influence and encourage to keep their work on theoretical physics.&lt;ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan, Former Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, former Head of the Nuclear Engineering Division, and former Head of the Reactor Engineering IAEA Division "/&gt;

Salam had a prolific research career in theoretical and high-energy physics.&lt;ref name="Riazuddin 2005 31"&gt;{{harv|Riazuddin|2005|pp=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salam had worked on theory of the [[neutrino]] – an elusive particle that was first postulated by [[Wolfgang Pauli]] in the 1930s. Salam introduced [[chiral symmetry]] in the theory of neutrinos. The introduction of chiral symmetry played crucial role in subsequent development of the [[Electroweak interaction|theory of electroweak interactions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Riazuddin|2005|pp=31–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salam later passed his work to [[Riazuddin (physicist)|Riazuddin]], who made pioneering contributions in neutrinos. Salam introduced the massive [[Higgs boson]]s to the theory of the [[Standard Model]], where he later predicted the existence of [[proton decay]]. In 1963, Salam published his theoretical work on the [[vector meson]]. The paper introduced the interaction of vector meson, photon (vector [[electrodynamics]]), and the [[renormalisation]] of vector mesons' known mass after the interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Riazuddin|1994|pp=124–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, Salam began to work with [[John Clive Ward]] on [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetries]] and [[electroweak unification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Salam | first1 = A. | last2 = Ward | first2 = J. C. | doi = 10.1007/BF02812723 | title = On a gauge theory of elementary interactions | journal = Il Nuovo Cimento | volume = 19 | pages = 165–170 | date = 1961 |bibcode = 1961NCim...19..165S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Salam | first1 = A. | last2 = Ward | first2 = J.

Salam was convinced that all the [[Fundamental interaction|elementary particle]] interactions are actually the gauge interactions.&lt;ref name="uddin 1994 149–157"&gt;{{harv|Riazuddin|1994|pp=149–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, together with [[Steven Weinberg|Weinberg]] and [[Sheldon Glashow]], Salam formulated the mathematical concept of their work. While in Imperial College, Salam, along with Glashow and [[Jeffrey Goldstone]], mathematically proved the [[Goldstone boson|Goldstone's theorem]], that a massless [[Spin (physics)|spin-zero]] object must appear in a theory as a result of spontaneous breaking of a continuous [[global symmetry]].&lt;ref name="uddin 1994 149–157"/&gt; In 1960, Salam and Weinberg incorporated the [[Higgs mechanism]] into Glashow's discovery, giving it a modern form in electroweak theory, and thus theorised the Standard Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author=Salam, A.  |editor=N. Svartholm |date=1968 |booktitle=Elementary Particle Physics: Relativistic Groups and Analyticity |pages=367 |conference=Eighth Nobel Symposium |publisher=Almquvist and Wiksell |location=Stockholm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, together with [[Steven Weinberg|Weinberg]] and [[Sheldon Glashow]], Salam finally formulated the mathematical concept of their work.[[File:Abdus Salam lecture.jpg|thumb|Abdus Salam lectures on G.U.T. at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Oriental Institute of Chicago|Oriental Institute]].]]In 1966, Salam carried out pioneering work on a [[hypothetical particle]]. Salam showed the possible [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] interaction between the [[Magnetic monopole]] and the [[CP-violation|C-violation]], thus he formulated the [[magnetic photon]].&lt;ref name="A. Salam 1966 683–684"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Salam, A. | title= Magnetic monopole and two photon theories of C-violation | journal=Physics Letters | volume=22 | date=1966 | issue=5 | pages= 683–684 | doi= 10.1016/0031-9163(66)90704-9|bibcode = 1966PhL....22..683S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of [[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers|PRL Symmetry Breaking]] papers in 1964, Steven Weinberg and Salam were the first to apply the Higgs mechanism to [[electroweak symmetry breaking]]. Salam provided a mathematical postulation for the interaction between the Higgs boson and the electroweak symmetry theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Riazuddin|1994|pp=156–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Salam began to work with [[Indian-American]] theoretical physicist [[Jogesh Pati]]. Pati wrote to Salam several times expressing interest to work under Salam's direction, in response to which Salam eventually invited Pati to the ICTP seminar in Pakistan. Salam suggested to Pati that there should be some deep reason why the protons and electrons are so different and yet carry equal but opposite electric charge. Protons carry quarks, but the electroweak theory was concerned only with the electrons and neutrinos, with nothing postulated about quarks. If all of nature's ingredients could be brought together in one new symmetry, it might reveal a reason for the various features of these particles and the forces they feel. This led to the development of [[Pati–Salam model]] in particle physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Salam and Jogesh Pati were the first to notice that since [[Quark]]s and [[Lepton]]s have very similar [[Special unitary group|SU(2)]] × [[Circle group|U(1)]] representation content, they all may have similar entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Riazuddin|1994|pp=321–322}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provided a simple realisation of the quark-lepton symmetry by postulating that [[lepton number]] was a fourth [[Color charge|colour]], dubbed "violet".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Riazuddin|1994|pp=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicists had believed that there were four fundamental forces of nature: the gravitational force, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and the electromagnetic force. Salam had worked on the unification of these forces from 1959 with Glashow and Weinberg. While at Imperial College London, Salam successfully showed that weak nuclear forces are not really different from electromagnetic forces, and two could inter-convert. Salam provided a theory that shows the unification of two fundamental forces of nature, weak nuclear forces and the electromagnetic forces, one into another.&lt;ref name="Riazuddin 2005 31"/&gt; Glashow had also formulated the same work, and the theory was combined in 1966. In 1967, Salam proved the electroweak unification theory mathematically, and finally published the papers. For this achievement, Salam, Glashow, and Weinberg were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979. The Nobel Prize Foundation paid tribute to the scientists and issued a statement saying: "For their contributions to the theory of the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles, including, inter alia, the prediction of the weak neutral current".&lt;ref name="Nobel Prize"/&gt;  In the 1970s Salam continued trying to unify forces by including the strong interaction in a [[grand unified theory]].

==Government work==
[[File:routeabdussalam.png|thumb|right|The road named after Abdus Salam in [[CERN]], Geneva]]
Abdus Salam returned to Pakistan in 1960 to take charge of a government post that was given to him by President [[Field Marshal Ayub Khan]]. From her [[Creation of Pakistan|independence]], Pakistan has never had a coherent [[Science in Pakistan|science policy]], and the total expenditure on research and development represent ~1.0% of Pakistan's GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ghani|1982|pp=64–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) headquarters was located in a small room, and less than 10 scientists were working on fundamental concepts of physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ghani|1982|pp=67–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdus Salam replaced [[Salimuzzaman Siddiqui]] as [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan)#Science Advisors|Science Advisor]], became first [[Chief technical officer|Member (technical)]] of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. Abdus Salam expanded the web of physics research and development in Pakistan by sending more than 500 scientists abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ishfaq Ahmad]], Abdus Salam was responsible for sending more than 500 scientists to the United States&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1961, Abdus Salam approached President Ayub Khan to set up the country's first national space agency.&lt;ref name="Suparco"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suparco.gov.pk/pages/history.asp |work=Suparco |title=Suparco's History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417192331/http://www.suparco.gov.pk/pages/history.asp |archivedate=17 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 September 1961, through an executive order, [[Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission]] was established, in which Abdus Salam served as the first director.&lt;ref name="Suparco"/&gt; Before 1960, very little work on scientific development was done, and scientific activities in Pakistan were almost diminished. Abdus Salam called [[Ishfaq Ahmad]], a nuclear physicist, who had left the country for Switzerland where he joined CERN, to Pakistan. With the support of Abdus Salam, PAEC established PAEC Lahore Center-6, with Ishfaq Ahmad as its first director.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Abdus Salam became a central and administrative figure to lead the research in both Theoretical and Particle physics.&lt;ref name="CERN Courier"/&gt; With the establishment of Institute of Physics at [[Quaid-e-Azam University]], the research in theoretical and particle physics was engaged.&lt;ref name="CERN Courier"/&gt; Under Abdus Salam's direction, physicists tackled the greatest outstanding problems in physics and mathematics.&lt;ref name="CERN Courier"/&gt;  Another physicist, [[Raziuddin Siddiqui]], established numerous physics research groups and supervised research activities in the academic institutions of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="ICTP"/&gt; Under the direction of Abdus Salam, research in physics reached a point that prompted worldwide recognition of Pakistani physicists.&lt;ref name="ICTP"/&gt;
[[File:International Centre for Theoretical Physics.jpg|left|thumb|[[International Centre for Theoretical Physics|Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] was founded by Salam in 1964.]]
From the 1950s, Salam had tried establishing high-powered research institutes in Pakistan, though he was unable to do so. Salam moved PAEC Headquarters to a bigger building, and established research laboratories all over the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=05–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the direction of Salam, [[Ishrat Hussain Usmani]] set up plutonium and uranium exploration committees throughout the country. In October 1961, Salam travelled to the United States and signed a space-co-operation agreement between Pakistan and United States. In November 1961, NASA started to build a space facility – [[Sonmiani (space facility)|Flight Test Range]] – in Balochistan where Abdus Salam served as its first technical director.

Abdus Salam played an influential and significant role in Pakistan's development in nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. In 1964, Abdus Salam was made head of Pakistan's IAEA delegation and represented Pakistan for a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Duff|2007|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Abdus Salam joined [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] – Abdus Salam's lifelong friend and contemporary at Government College University. Khan was the first person in the IAEA that Abdus Salam had consulted about the establishment of [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]], a research physics institution, in [[Trieste]], Italy. With an agreement signed with IAEA, the International Centre for Theoretical Physics was set up with Abdus Salam as its first director. At IAEA, Abdus Salam had advocated the importance of nuclear power plants in his country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Duff|2007|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was due to his effort that in 1965, Canada and Pakistan signed a nuclear energy co-operation deal. Salam had obtained the permission from Ayub Khan – against the wishes of Ayub Khan's own government functionaries – to set up the [[Karachi Nuclear Power Plant|nuclear power plant]] near Karachi.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Riazuddin|2005|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, with the efforts led by Abdus Salam, the United States and Pakistan signed an agreement in which the US provided Pakistan with a small [[Pakistan Atomic Research Reactor#PARR-I Reactor|research reactor]]. Abdus Salam had a long dream to establish a research institute in Pakistan, for which he had advocated on many different occasions. In 1965, Abdus Salam and [[Edward Durrell Stone]] signed a contract for the establishment of [[Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology]] at [[Nilore]], Islamabad.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space programme===
{{Main article|Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission}}
Salam was the founder of Pakistan's space programme as he was responsible for the establishment of the [[space research]] activities in Pakistan. In early 1961, Salam approached President Ayub Khan to lay the foundation of country's first executive agency to co-ordinate space research.&lt;ref name="Suparco"/&gt; On 16 September 1961, through an executive order, the [[Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission]] (SUPARCO) was established of which Salam was made its first and founder director of the agency.&lt;ref name="Suparco"/&gt; Salam immediately travelled to United States, where he successfully signed a space co-operation agreement with United States Government. In November 1961, NASA built [[Sonmiani (space facility)|Flight Test Center]] (FTC) in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan Province]]. During this time, Salam visited [[Pakistan Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]] where he met with [[Air Commodore]] ([[Brigadier-General]]) [[Wladyslaw Turowicz]] – a Polish military scientist and an [[aerospace engineer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Duff|2007|pp=50–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Turowicz was made the first technical director of the space centre, and a programme of rocket testing ensued. In 1964, while in the United States, Salam visited the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], and met with nuclear engineers [[Salim Mehmud]] and [[Tariq Mustafa]].&lt;ref name="CNBC Pakistan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3927488686022979715# |work=CNBC |title=Abdus Salam's footprint in Pakistan's Space Programme |date=13 May 2007 |author=Mehmud, Salim |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622100656/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3927488686022979715%23 |archivedate=22 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Salam signed another agreement with [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) in which NASA launched a programme to provide training to Pakistan's scientists and engineers.&lt;ref name="CNBC Pakistan"/&gt; Both nuclear engineers returned to Pakistan in few months and were inducted in Suparco.&lt;ref name="Suparco"/&gt;

===Nuclear weapons programme===
{{See also|Project-706#Organization|Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction}}
Salam knew the importance of [[nuclear technology]] in Pakistan, for civilian and peaceful purposes.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Defence Journal"/&gt; But, according to his biographers, Salam played an ambiguous role in Pakistan's own integrated atomic bomb project. As late as the 1960s, Salam made an unsuccessful attempt for a proposal for the establishment of nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, but it was deferred the matter on economic grounds by Ayub Khan.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Defence Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shabbir |first=Usman |author2=Syed Ahmed |author3=H Khan |title=Pakistan's Nuclear Journey – from Multan to Chaghi: Development and testing of nuclear weapons |journal=Pakistan Defence Journal |date=May 2007 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=42–56 |url=http://www.pakdef.info/ereporter/PakDef%20Mag%20Vol%201%20Issue%202.pdf |accessdate=12 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221190710/http://www.pakdef.info/ereporter/PakDef%20Mag%20Vol%201%20Issue%202.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rehman, Salam's influence in nuclear development was lessened and diminished as late as 1974, and he became critical of Bhutto's control over science.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Defence Journal"/&gt; But Salam personally did not terminate his connection with the scientists working in the theoretical physics division at PAEC.&lt;ref name="Rahman 1998 15–19"&gt;{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=15–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1972–73, he had been a great advocate for the atomic bomb project,&lt;ref name="Norman Dombey, Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Sussex"/&gt; but subsequently took a stance against it after he fell out with Bhutto over the issue of [[Second Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|the Ahmaddiya denomination as non-Islamic]].&lt;ref name="Norman Dombey, Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Sussex"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dombey|first=Norman|title=Salam's Part in the Pakistan's atomic bomb projects|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:nEoPfxzPkNEJ:arxiv.org/pdf/1112.2266+Munir+Khan+nuclear+physics&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShQmDsuYoVt0GT8axNM0X0pjNXkMe3AGotfelN95mdjDAF3NmyIY7FX38mbDXfrxtQUeby8RWbmdxnJYTIGwUFF8ExKjEbUNmzhWb0qJlPfE25kYXhAjjs8KX4ZPYj4hCoqAbK5&amp;sig=AHIEtbScOMeOEw-JdPP4eX2pZLyOg9LDng|publisher=Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Sussex|accessdate=30 October 2012|location=Brighton BN1 9QH|format=google docs|date=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Salam led the establishing of the nuclear research institute—[[Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=09–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, the plutonium reactor [[Pakistan Atomic Research Reactor]] went [[Critical mass|critical]] under the leadership of Salam.&lt;ref name="Rahman 1998 15–19"/&gt; In 1973, Salam proposed the idea of establishing an annual college to promote scientific activities in the country to the Chairman of PAEC, [[Munir Ahmad Khan]], who wholeheartedly accepted and fully supported this idea. This led to the establishment of the [[International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics and Contemporary Needs]] (INSC), where each year since 1976 scientists from all over the world come to Pakistan to interact with Pakistani scientists. The first annual INSC conference was held on advanced particle and nuclear physics.

In November 1971, Salam met with [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] in his residence, and following Bhutto's advice, Salam went to United States to avoid the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 Indo-Pak winter war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=25–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Salam had travelled to the United States and returned to Pakistan with scientific literature about the [[Manhattan Project]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and calculations involving in atomic bombs.&lt;ref name="Norman Dombey, Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Sussex"/&gt; In 1972, the Government of Pakistan learned about the development status of the first atomic bomb completed under the [[Indian nuclear programme]]. On 20 January 1972, at the Multan meeting, Bhutto orchestrated to develop the deterrence programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=3–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Former prime minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, formed a group of scientists and engineers, which was first headed by Salam.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=38–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Salam, as Science Advisor to the [[President of Pakistan|President]], had managed and participated in a secret meeting of nuclear scientists with Bhutto in [[Multan]], which came to be known as the "''Multan Meeting''". At this meeting, only [[Ishrat Hussain Usmani|I.H. Usmani]] protested, believing that the country had neither facilities nor talent to carry out such an ambitious and technologically remanding project at that time, whilst Salam remained quiet.&lt;ref name="Lancers Publications, US" /&gt;  Here, Bhutto entrusted Salam and appointed Munir Ahmad Khan as Chairman of the PAEC and head of the atomic bomb program, as Salam had supported Khan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Abdus had led groundbreaking work at the TPG and was initially headed by Salam until 1974.&lt;ref name="Norman Dombey, Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Sussex"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

An office was set up for Salam in the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime ministers' Secretariat]] by order of Bhutto.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Defence Journal"/&gt; Salam immediately started to motivate and invite scientists to begin work with PAEC in the development of fission weapons.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Defence Journal"/&gt; In December 1972, two [[theoretical physicist]]s working at the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] were asked by Salam to report to [[Munir Ahmad Khan]], the scientific director of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the beginning of the "Theoretical Physics Group (TPG)", reporting directly to Salam.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TPG, in PAEC, was assigned to conduct research in [[fast neutron calculations]], [[hydrodynamics]] (how the explosion produced by a chain reaction might behave), problems of neutron diffusion, and the development of theoretical designs of Pakistan's nuclear weapon devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Theoretical Physics Group working under the leadership of [[Riazuddin (physicist)|Riazuddin]], who was also Salam's student, began to directly report to Salam, and the work on the theoretical design of the nuclear weapon device was completed in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Salam had led the groundbreaking work in the development of the weapons programme, with Khan. In 1972, Salam had formed the Mathematical Physics Group, under [[Raziuddin Siddiqui]], that was charged, with the Theoretical Physics Group, with carrying out research in the theory of [[Relativity of simultaneity|simultaneity]] during the detonation process, and the mathematics involved in the theory of nuclear fission&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=45–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following India's surprise [[nuclear test]] —[[Pokhran-I]] – in 1974, [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] had called for a meeting to initiate work on atomic bomb, which was attended by Salam and at which [[Muhammad Hafeez Qureshi]] was appointed head of the Directorate of Technical Development in PAEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=22–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DTD was set up to co-ordinate the work of the various specialised groups of scientists and engineers working on different aspects of the atomic bomb.&lt;ref name="Rahman 1998 55–59"/&gt; The word "[[Atomic bomb|bomb]]" was never used in this meeting, but the participants fully understood what was being discussed.&lt;ref name="Rahman 1998 55–59"/&gt; On March 1974, Salam and Khan also established the Wah Group Scientist that was charged with manufacturing materials, explosive lenses and [[Nuclear weapon design|triggering mechanism]] development of the weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the setting up of DTD, Salam, along with Riazuddin and [[Munir Ahmad Khan]], visited the [[Pakistan Ordnance Factories]] (POF) where they held talks with senior military engineers led by POF chairman [[Lieutenant-General]] Qamar Ali Mirza.&lt;ref name="Rahman 1998 75–76"/&gt; It was there that the [[Corps of Engineers, Pakistan Army|Corps of Engineers]] built the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] in [[Wah Cantonment|Wah Cantt]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Wah Group working under the DTD was charged with the material and [[Nuclear weapon design|triggering mechanism]] development of the weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=41–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salam remained associated with the nuclear weapons programme until the mid-1974, when he left the country after [[Ahmadi]] were declared non-Muslims by the Pakistani Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; His own relations with Prime minister Bhutto fell out and turned into open hostility after the [[Ahmadiyya Community]] was declared as not-Islamic; he lodged a public and powerful protest against Bhutto regarding this issue and gave great criticism to Bhutto over his control over science.&lt;ref name="Norman Dombey, Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Sussex"/&gt; In spite of this, Salam maintained close relations with the theoretical physics division at PAEC who kept him informed about every status of the calculations needed to calculate the performance of the atomic bomb, according to Norman Dombey.&lt;ref name="Norman Dombey, Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Sussex"/&gt; After seeing Indian [[Siachen conflict|aggression]] in [[Northern Pakistan]], followed by [[Operation Brasstacks|massive troops rotation]] in [[Sindh|Southern Pakistan]], Salam again renewed his ties with the senior scientists working in the atomic bomb projects, including [[Ishfaq Ahmad]] and others, who had kept him informed about the scientific development of the program.&lt;ref name="Norman Dombey, Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Sussex"/&gt; In the 1980s, Salam personally approved many appointments and a large influx of Pakistani scientists to the associateship program at [[ICTP]] and [[CERN]], and engaged in research in theoretical physics with his students at the ICTP.&lt;ref name="Norman Dombey, Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Sussex"/&gt;

In 2008, Indian scholar Ravi Singh noted in his book that "in 1978, Abdus Salam with PAEC officials, paid a secret visit to China, and was instrumental in initiating industrial nuclear cooperation between the two countries."&lt;ref name="Lancers Publications, US"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Ravi Shekhar Narain|title=The Military Factor in Pakistan|date=2008|publisher=Lancers Publications, U.S.|location=United States|isbn=978-0-9815378-9-4|pages=403–404|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wCm2DFZblOYC&amp;pg=PA404}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he had left the country, Salam did not hesitate to advise the PAEC and Theoretical and Mathematical Physics Group on important scientific matters, and kept his close association with TPG and PAEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Riazuddin|2005|pp=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy for science==

In 1964, Salam founded the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] (ICTP), [[Trieste]], in the North-East of Italy and served as its director until 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ictp.it/ |title=The Ictp |publisher=Ictp.it |date=3 December 2012 |accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, he founded [[International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics and Contemporary Needs|International Nathiagali Summer College]] (INSC) to promote science in his country.&lt;ref name="INSC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ncp.edu.pk/insc/index.htm |work=INSC |title=International Nathiagali Summer College |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002154826/http://www.ncp.edu.pk/insc/index.htm |archivedate=2 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The INSC is an annual meeting of scientists from all over the world to come to Pakistan and hold discussions on different aspects of physics and science.&lt;ref name="INSC"/&gt; Even today, the INSC holds annual meetings, and Salam's pupil student Riazuddin is its director since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organizers of INSC |url=http://www.ncp.edu.pk/insc/organizers.htm |accessdate=12 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612082445/http://www.ncp.edu.pk/insc/organizers.htm |archivedate=12 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the scientists at ICTP commemorated Salam and renamed ICTP as "[[Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics]]". Salam had advocated for development of Science in third world countries, and attended various seminars in different countries. Throughout the years, Salam served on a number of United Nations committees concerning science and technology in developing countries.&lt;ref name="NobelBio" /&gt; Salam also founded the [[Third World Academy of Sciences]] (TWAS) and was a leading figure in the creation of a number of international centres dedicated to the advancement of science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Third World Academy of Sciences|url=http://www.twas.org/|accessdate =12 March 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425060340/http://www.twas.org/| archivedate= 25 April 2011| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his visit at the Institute of Physics of [[Quaid-i-Azam University]] in 1979, Salam had explained after receiving his award: ''Physicists believed there are four fundamental forces of nature; the gravitational force, the weak and strong nuclear force, and the electromagnetic force''.&lt;ref name="Riazuddin 2005 34"&gt;{{harv|Riazuddin|2005|pp=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salam was a firm believer that "scientific thought is the common heritage of mankind", and that developing nations needed to help themselves and invest in their own scientists to boost development and reduce the gap between the [[North–South divide|Global South and the Global North]], thus contributing to a more peaceful world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1981, Salam became a founding member of the [[World Cultural Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About Us | publisher = [[World Cultural Council]] | url = http://www.consejoculturalmundial.org/about-us/ | accessdate = November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Salam had departed from Pakistan, he did not terminate his connection to Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Riazuddin|2005|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salam continued inviting Pakistan's scientists to ICTP, and maintained a research programme for the Pakistani scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=300–301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many prominent scientists, including [[Ghulam Murtaza (physicist)|Ghulam Murtaza]], [[Riazuddin (physicist)|Riazuddin]], [[Kamaluddin Ahmed (physicist)|Kamaluddin Ahmed]], [[Faheem Hussain]], [[Raziuddin Siddiqui]], [[Munir Ahmad Khan]], [[Ishfaq Ahmad]], and [[I. H. Usmani]], considered him as their mentor and a teacher.

==Personal life==
Salam was a very private individual, who kept his public and personal lives quite separate.&lt;ref name="kibble98"/&gt; He married twice; first time to a cousin, the second time in accordance with [[Nikah|Islamic law]],&lt;ref name="nyt-obit"&gt;{{cite news|work=New York Times|title=Abdus Salam Is Dead at 70; Physicist Shared Nobel Prize|last=Browne|first=Malcolm W.|date=23 November 1996|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/23/world/abdus-salam-is-dead-at-70-physicist-shared-nobel-prize.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="johnson-guardian-obit"&gt;{{cite news|work=The Telegraph|title=Professor Dame Louise Johnson|date=8 October 2012|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9594182/Professor-Dame-Louise-Johnson.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at his death, was survived by three daughters and a son by his first wife, and a son and daughter by his second, Professor [[Louise Johnson|Dame Louise Johnson]], formerly Professor of [[Molecular biophysics]] in [[Oxford University]]. Two of his daughters are; Anisa Bushra Salam Bajwa and Aziza Rahman.

===Religion===
Abdus Salam was an [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi Muslim]],&lt;ref name="NobelBio" /&gt; who saw his religion as a fundamental part of his scientific work. He once wrote that "the Holy Quran enjoins us to reflect on the verities of Allah's created laws of nature; however, that our generation has been privileged to glimpse a part of His design is a bounty and a grace for which I render thanks with a humble heart."''&lt;ref name="NobelBio" /&gt;

During his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize in Physics, Salam quoted verses from the [[Quran]] and stated:
{{quote|"Thou seest not, in the creation of the All-merciful any imperfection, Return thy gaze, seest thou any fissure? Then Return thy gaze, again and again. Thy gaze, Comes back to thee dazzled, aweary." [67:3–4]

This, in effect, is the faith of all physicists; the deeper we seek, the more is our wonder excited, the more is the dazzlement for our gaze.&lt;ref name="The Nobel Prize in Physics 1979 - Banquet Speech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/salam-speech.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1979 – Banquet Speech |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=10 December 1979 |accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1974, the Pakistan parliament made a [[Second Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|constitutional amendment]] that declared [[Ahmadi]] as non-Muslims. In protest, Salam left Pakistan for London. After his departure, Salam did not completely terminate his connection to Pakistan, and kept his close association with the Theoretical Physics Group as well as academic scientists from Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC).&lt;ref name="Riazuddin 2005 34"/&gt; At ICTP, Salam had launched series of post-research programmes for Pakistani academics with whom he had developed extremely close relations. In 1983, Riazuddin and [[Asghar Qadir]] returned to ICTP where they had joined Salam, and stayed with him until 1990.&lt;ref name="Chowk.com"/&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Grave of Abdus Salam.jpg|thumb|right|The defaced grave of Abdus Salam at [[Rabwah]], Pakistan]]
Abdus Salam died peacefully on 21 November 1996 at the age of 70 in [[Oxford, England|Oxford]], England, from [[progressive supranuclear palsy]] (PSP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abdus Salam Is Dead at 70; Physicist Shared Nobel Prize|author=Browne, Malcolm W. |date=21 November 1996|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/23/world/abdus-salam-is-dead-at-70-physicist-shared-nobel-prize.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was returned to Pakistan and kept in Darul Ziafat, where some 13,000 men and women visited to pay their last respects. Approximately 30,000 people attended his funeral prayers.

Salam was buried in [[Bahishti Maqbara]], a cemetery established by the [[Ahmadiyya Community]] at [[Rabwah]], Punjab, Pakistan, next to his parents' graves. The epitaph on his tomb initially read "First Muslim Nobel Laureate". The Pakistani government removed "Muslim" and left only his name on the headstone.Pakistan is infamous for its persecution of the [[Ahmadi]] people. They are the only nation to officially declare that Ahmadis are non-muslim. &lt;ref name=AHRC&gt;{{cite web|title=PAKISTAN: Is Dr. Abdus Salam – a Nobel Laureate or persona non grata?|url=http://www.humanrights.asia/news/ahrc-news/AHRC-ART-128-2012|accessdate=28 November 2012|publisher=Asian Human Rights Commission|date=22 November 2012|author=Baseer Naweed|author2=Stewart Sloan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "Muslim" was initially obscured on the orders of a local magistrate before moving to the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan clerics persecute 'non-Muslims'|author=Wilkinson, Isambard |date=25 December 2007|work=Daily Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1573619/Pakistan-clerics-persecute-non-Muslims.html|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Ordinance XX]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepersecution.org/50years/paklaw.html | title=Government of Pakistan – Law for Ahmadis | accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; being an [[Ahmadi]], he was considered a non-Muslim according to the definition provided in the [[Second Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|II Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of Pakistan]].

===Legacy===
{{Rquote|right|His craving for [[Pakistani nationalism|nationalism]] is symbolized best by his wish to be buried in his own homeland... He loved his country and its soil.

Salam's work in Pakistan has been far reaching and regarded as highly influential. Salam is remembered as his peers and students as the "father of Pakistan's school of Theoretical Physics" as well as Pakistan's science. Abdus Salam was a charismatic and an iconic figure, as much as a symbol among them of what they were working or/ researching toward in their respected field.&lt;ref name="The Dawn Newspapers (Archive, 21 November 2011)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Muslim Times, Lahore"&gt;{{cite news|last=Alim|first=Abdul|title=Who is the Father (Salam or Khan)?|url=http://www.themuslimtimes.org/2012/09/uncategorized/who-is-baba-e-bum-a-q-khan|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=Muslim Times, Lahore|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawn News International, Archive 2004"/&gt; His students, fellow scientists and engineers, remembered him as brilliant teacher, and engaging researcher who would also influence among others to do the same.&lt;ref name="Riazuddin 2005 31"/&gt; Salam founded the [[Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission|Space Research Commission]] of which he served its first founding director in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Riazuddin 2005 31"/&gt; In 1998, the Government of Pakistan issued a commemorative stamp to honour the services of Salam as part of its "Scientists of Pakistan" series.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Post Office Department"/&gt; His alma mater, Government College Lahore, now a university, has [[Abdus Salam Chair in Physics]] and [[Abdus Salam School of Mathematics|Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences]] named after him.&lt;ref name="ASSMS, Government College University"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gcu.edu.pk/ASSMS.htm |title=Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences |publisher=Gcu.edu.pk |accessdate=9 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016190004/http://gcu.edu.pk/ASSMS.htm |archivedate=16 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Abdus Salam Chair (LUMS)|Abdus Salam Chair]] was also established in his honour at the Syed Babar Ali School of Science and Engineering in [[Lahore University of Management Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Honouring a Nobel laureate: Prof Asad Abidi named inaugural holder of Abdus Salam Chair|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1292051/honouring-nobel-laureate-prof-asad-abidi-named-inaugural-holder-abdus-salam-chair/|accessdate=2 June 2017|work=[[Express Tribune]]|date=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the immense services he had done for Pakistan and the Government, he has been discriminated against because of his affiliation with the [[Ahmadiyya]] sect, which the Pakistan Government has denounced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/8744092.stm |work=BBC News | first=Mohammed | last=Hanif | title=Why Pakistan's Ahmadi community is officially detested | date=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also made a significant contribution towards the recent success of search for the Higgs boson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/abdus-salams-son-flays-pak-hypocrisy/974037/0 | title=Abdus Salam's son flays Pak hypocrisy|work=Indian Express | date= 14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Salam has been commemorated by Pakistan's noted and prominent scientists, who were also his students. Many scientists have recalled their college experiences. [[Ghulam Murtaza (physicist)|Ghulam Murtaza]], a professor of [[plasma physics]] at the Government College University and student of Salam, wrote:

[[File:Dr. Abdus Salam Scientists of Pakistan.jpg|thumb|upright|A commemorative stamp to honour Abdus Salam.]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;When Dr. Salam was to deliver a lecture, the hall would be packed and although the subject was [[Particle Physics]], his manner and eloquence was such as if he was talking about literature. When he finished his lectures, listeners would often burst into spontaneous applause and give him a standing ovation. People from all parts of the world would come to [[Imperial College]] and seek Dr. Salam's help. He would give a patient hearing to everyone including those who were talking nonsense. He treated everyone with respect and compassion and never belittled or offended anyone. Dr. Salam's strength was that he could "sift jewels from the sand".&lt;ref name="chowkbio"&gt;Zainab Mahmood (November 26, 2004){{cite web|url=http://www.chowk.com/articles/8387 |title=Dr Abdus Salam – The 'Mystic' scientist |accessdate=2009-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216051624/http://www.chowk.com/articles/8387 |archivedate=16 February 2008 |df=dmy }}. Chowk: Science&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ishfaq Ahmad]], former chairman of the PAEC and a lifelong friend of Salam recalls:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dr Salam was responsible for sending about 500 physicists, mathematicians and scientists from Pakistan, for PhD's to the best institutions in UK and USA.&lt;ref name="chowkbio"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In August 1996, the former chairman of PAEC and lifelong friend, [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] met Salam in Oxford. Munir Ahmad Khan, who headed the [[Pakistan and Nuclear Weapons|nuclear weapons]] and [[Nuclear energy in Pakistan|energy programme]], said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;My last meeting with Abdus Salam was only three months ago. His disease had taken its toll and he was unable to talk. Yet he understood what was said. I told him about the celebration held in Pakistan on his seventieth birthday. He kept staring at me. He had risen above praise. As I rose to leave he pressed my hand to express his feelings as if he wanted to thank everyone who had said kind words about him. Dr. Abdus Salam had deep love for Pakistan in spite of the fact that he was treated unfairly and indifferently by his own country. It became more and more difficult for him to come to Pakistan and this hurt him deeply. Now he has returned home finally, to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much. May be in the years to come we will rise above our prejudice and own him and give him, after his death, what we could not when he was alive. We [[Pakistanis]] may choose to ignore Dr. Salam, but the world at large will always remember him.&lt;ref name="chowkbio"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Documentaries on Abdus Salam==
;Salam – the film
LLC started formally researching and developing a film on the science and life of Abdus Salam in 2004, two years after the producers had conceived of the idea. A fundraising teaser was released by Kailoola Productions to coincide with Salam's birth anniversary on 29 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salam|url=http://kailoola.com/salam/|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The post-production phase of this documentary film, pending funding, is estimated at US$150,000.

===Contributions===
Salam's primary focus was research on the physics of elementary particles. His particular numerous groundbreaking contributions included:

* two-component [[neutrino]] theory and the prediction of the inevitable parity violation in [[weak interaction]];
* gauge [[Unified field theory|unification]] of weak and electromagnetic interactions, the unified force is called the "[[Electroweak interaction|Electroweak]]" force, a name given to it by Salam, and which forms the basis of the [[Standard Model]] in particle physics;
* predicted existence of weak [[neutral currents]] and [[W particles]] and [[Z particles]] before their experimental discovery;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1979|url=http://www.nobel.se/physics/laureates/1979|publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|accessdate=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* symmetry properties of elementary particles; [[unitary symmetry]];
* renormalisation of meson theories;
* gravity theory and its role in particle physics; two tensor theory of gravity and strong interaction physics;
* unification of electroweak with strong nuclear forces, [[grand unification theory]];
* related prediction of proton-decay;
* [[Pati–Salam model]], a grand unification theory;
* [[Supersymmetry]] theory, in particular formulation of [[Superspace]] and formalism of [[superfield]]s in 1974;
* the theory of [[supermanifold]]s, as a geometrical framework for understanding supersymmetry, in 1974;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Frédéric|last=Hélein|title=A representation formula for maps on supermanifolds|journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics|volume=49|date=2008|pages=023506|doi=10.1063/1.2840464|arxiv = math-ph/0603045 |bibcode = 2008JMP....49b3506H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], the concept of '''The Absolute''', also known as '''The (Unconditioned) Ultimate''', '''The Wholly Other''', '''The [[Supreme Being]]''',  '''The Absolute/Ultimate Reality''', and other names, is the thing, being, entity, power, force, reality, presence, law, principle, etc. that possesses maximal [[Ontology|ontological]] status, existential ranking, existential greatness, or existentiality. In layman's terms, this is the one that is, in one way or another, the greatest, truest, or most [[Reality|real]] [[being]].

There are many conceptions of The Absolute in various fields and subjects, such as [[philosophy]], [[religion]], [[Spirituality|spiritual traditions]], [[mathematics]], and even [[natural science]]. The nature of these conceptions can range from "merely" encompassing all [[Physics|physical]] existence, [[nature]], or [[reality]], to being completely unconditioned existentially, [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcending]] all concepts, notions, and types, kinds, and categories of being.

The Absolute is often thought of as causing to come into being manifestations that interact with lower or lesser forms of being. This is either done passively, through [[Emanationism|emanations]], or actively, through [[avatar]]s and [[incarnation]]s. These existential manifestations, which themselves can possess [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] attributes, only contain minuscule or infinitesimal portions of the true essence of The Absolute.

The term itself was not in use in ancient or medieval philosophy, but closely related to the description of God as ''[[Actus purus]]'' (Pure Actuality) in [[scholasticism]]. It was introduced in modern philosophy, notably by [[Hegel]], for "the sum of all being, actual and potential".&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=The Absolute}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term has since also been adopted in  [[perennial philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Perennial Philosophy|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|isbn=9780061724947|location=New York|language=English}}

==Major conceptions of The Absolute==
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}
There are three general ways of conceiving the Absolute. The Absolute might be (1) the first and greatest being, (2) not a being at all but the "ground" of being, or (3) both the ground of being and a being.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In conception one the Absolute is the most true and intelligible reality. It can be spoken of and known. For example, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s Absolute Spirit is the most true reality. It is thinkable, speakable, and exists in the objective world by comprehending everything, including people, states, and world history.

In conception two the Absolute might be conceived of as utterly outside of all other reality and hence unintelligible. It cannot be known or spoken about. Plato's Socrates says that "[[Form of the Good|The Form of the Good]]" is "beyond being",&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Republic'', Book VI, 508.&lt;/ref&gt; implying that it is even beyond thought, language, and normal categories of existence.

St. [[John of the Cross]] says:
{{poemquote
|text=He who truly arrives there
cuts free from himself;
all that he knew before
now seems worthless,
and his knowledge so soars
that he is left in unknowing
transcending all knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Works-Saint-John-Cross-ebook/dp/B00V21HZ8G/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461745961&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=st+john+of+the+cross|title=The Complete Works of Saint John of the Cross, Volume 1 of 2|last=Cross|first=St John of the|date=2015-01-16|publisher=Waxkeep Publishing|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In conception three the Absolute is seen as transcending duality and distinction. This concept of a fundamental reality that transcends or includes all other reality is usually (but not always) associated with [[divinity]]. While this conception initially seems contradictory, it has been highly influential. One way to understand this third conception is to consider the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]''.

{{poemquote
|text=The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
|source=Tao Te Ching, 1
}}

These opening lines distinguish between two [[Tao]]s. One is the "eternal Tao" (which cannot be named or explained) and the other "Tao" seems to exist in space and time (and can be named and explained). The eternal Tao is beyond existence and cannot be named or fully understood, while the other Tao exists and can be known. The eternal Tao is infinite; the other is finite. The eternal Tao is formless; the other is formed. The eternal Tao is transcendent; the other is immanent. The other "Tao" is an attempt to describe the "eternal Tao" in human terms; but such effort can never express the eternal Tao fully. He continues:
{{poemquote
|text=The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth
The named is the mother of myriad things
Thus, constantly without desire, one observes its essence
Constantly with desire, one observes its manifestations
These two emerge together but differ in name
The unity is said to be the mystery.
}}

In these lines, he further discusses the difference between the two Taos. The eternal Tao is "nameless" and is the origin of Heaven and Earth; this origin can be understood as an underlying [[metaphysics]] that cannot be described fully. The "named" Tao, on the other hand, is able to describe specific phenomenons that exist in space and time, hence it is the mother of myriad of things; it also can be treated as the humanly conceived concepts in the effort to describe our physical world. Later, he points out that both the "named" and the "nameless" emerge together from the same eternal Tao. This seemingly self-contradictory unity, of course, is said to be the mystery to be understood.

===Interpretations===
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}
While these conceptions are superficially similar, they admit of multiple interpretations. Some philosophers, especially perennialists and [[pantheism|pantheist]] philosophers, find great significance in the similarities between these different words and argue that various/all cultures past and present have an identical concept of the 'Absolute'.

Other philosophers, however, argue that these concepts are not the same,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c6aHAgAAQBAJ|title=Philosophy of Religion: A Contemporary Introduction|last=Yandell|first=Keith E.|date=2002-01-22|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134827237|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moser|first=Paul|date=2009-01-01|title=Exclusivism, Inclusivism, and Kardiatheology|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/MOSEIA|journal=Philosophia Christi|volume=11|issue=2|pages=293–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the Logos is rational and formal whereas Brahman is formless and irrational; and since Plato's Form of the Good is impersonal where the Christian God is personal; since Bradley's Absolute is a conscious experience whereas [[Brand Blanshard]]'s Absolute is an unconscious, intelligible system.

Perennialist philosophers such as John Hick argue that even if the concepts vary slightly, the reality of the Absolute reality behind the varying concepts is the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hick/|title=Hick, John {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Within religious traditions ====
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}
Philosophers such as [[Adi Shankara]] denied the Absolute any personal sense, whereas philosophers such as [[Ramanuja]] and [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]], tended to identify the Absolute with a [[Ishvara|personal God]]. The [[Traditionalist School]], via [[Frithjof Schuon]], admits:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is true that God as creator, revealer, and savior is not to be identified with the Absolute as such; it is likewise true that God in Himself, in the full depth of His reality, is not to be reduced to the creative Function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.studiesincomparativereligion.com/Public/articles/browse_g.aspx?ID=261|title=Form and Substance in the Religions|last=Schuon|first=Frithjof|date=1974|website=Studies in Comparative Religion|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Early Hinduism identified [[Brahman]] with [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]]. The same immortal spirit was conceived of as functional in the world in three ways: creation, preservation, and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03270.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 3: Vana Parva: Draupadi-harana Parva: Section CCLXX|last=Ganguli|first=Kisari Mohan|date=|website=Sacred Texts|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|quote=The Supreme Spirit hath three conditions. In the form of Brahma, he is the Creator, and in the form of Vishnu he is the Preserver, and in his form as Rudra, he is the Destroyer of the Universe!}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was therefore no real contradiction between [[Bhakti|love of a personal God]] and [[Brahman|an impersonal Absolute]], although the latter was sometimes conceived of as "purer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mahavidya.ca/2015/03/04/nirguna-and-saguna-brahman/|title=Nirguna and Saguna Brahman|last=Rodrigues|first=Hillary|date=2015|website=Mahavidya|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|quote=Until this occurs, “the world…even including Isvara (the Lord), is not ultimately true or real, but that ultimate reality belongs only to the infinite, eternal, unchanging, pure bliss consciousness that is Brahman…all that we see with our senses, even our private thoughts, Advaita claims, are not ultimately real” (Betty 216).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shaivism]], and most [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] Indian religions, gave God five functions: creation, preservation, destruction, concealment, and revelation. [[Shiva]], as [[Brahman]], would therefore act in the world as a personal God. Yet this distinction between the Absolute and Infinite, or Transcendent and Immanent is not entirely, in itself, absolute. Philosophers like Shankara believe that upon doing away with [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] the entire universe disappears, including the notion of a personal God. Philosophers such as [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]] and [[Ramanuja]], tend to propound an identification of the Absolute with God, whereas later philosophers such as [[Nimbarka]] and [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Caitanya]], tended to identify the Absolute with a personal form of God ([[Krishna]]). Either way, all these claims, taken in context, tend to prove non-contradictory.

The quote above, via Schuon, is actually fully represented within the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition. [[Brahma]], the creator god, is not worshiped within Hinduism. The only deities that are worshiped, are [[Shiva]], and [[Vishnu]]. Both Shiva and Vishnu, by their respective devotees, are represented as having power over the following five functions: creation, preservation, destruction, concealment, and revelation. However, a further distinction is made by Shankara: God is not [[Brahman]] (the Absolute). Rather the appearance of God is still via the power of [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]. So there are in effect, three levels, which Schuon himself observes: Brahman (the Absolute), God as creator, revealer, and savior (AKA, Shiva or Vishnu), and finally God as creator (AKA, Brahma). Incidental reasons are given for Brahma's lack of worship, a Hindu myth attributes this situation to a curse by [[Bhrigu]]. [[Devdutt Pattanaik]], an Indian author, gives some philosophical reasons. Ultimately the reason is actually inherent ("inherent" in the Absolute) and theological.

== Relation of humanity to the Absolute==
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}

[[Laozi]] taught that the Tao was not only the ultimate reality but the ideal of human life. Another conceptual similarity between various conceptions is that the ultimate reality also somehow reveals to humans the way to live. For example, Plato taught that the Good was both the source of reality, the highest object of knowledge, and the ultimate end of desire.

[[C. S. Lewis]] explains the connection between the highest reality and human action in this way:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLRLoWGgWqYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=abolition+of+man&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiz_sDY3P_ZAhXJrFQKHcIlCPgQ6AEIKTAA&amp;q=rta|title=The Abolition of Man|last=Lewis|first=C.S.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1943|isbn=978-0-06-065294-4|location=United Kingdom|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|text=In early Hinduism that conduct in men which can be called good consists in conformity to, or almost participation in, the Rta—that great ritual or pattern of nature and supernature which is revealed alike in the cosmic order, the moral virtues, and the ceremonial of the temple. Righteousness, correctness, order, the Rta, is constantly identified with satya or truth, correspondence to reality. As Plato said that the Good was 'beyond existence' and Wordsworth that through virtue the stars were strong, so the Indian masters say that the gods themselves are born of the Rta and obey it. The Chinese also speak of a great thing (the greatest thing) called the Tao. It is the reality beyond all predicates, the abyss that was before the Creator Himself. It is Nature, it is the Way, the Road. It is the Way in which the universe goes on, the Way in which things everlastingly emerge, stilly and tranquilly, into space and time. It is also the Way which every man should tread in imitation of that cosmic and supercosmic progression, conforming all activities to that great exemplar. 'In ritual', say the Analects, 'it is harmony with Nature that is prized.' The ancient Jews likewise praise the Law as being 'true'. This conception in all its forms, Platonic, Aristotelian, Stoic, Christian, and Oriental alike, I shall henceforth refer to for brevity simply as 'the Tao'.|sign=C.S. Lewis|source=The Abolition of Man}}

[[I. K. Taimni]] says:
{{Quotation|Because the Ultimate Reality which is denoted by the word 'Absolute' or 'Parabrahman' (卍) is the very core of our being as well as the cause and basis of the universe of which we are part, we can no more get away from it than our solar system can get away from the sun round which it resolves and from which it receives everything which keeps it alive and moving. Although the Absolute is sometimes referred to by such epithets as the Void, Ever-Darkness etc. and is beyond intellectual comprehension, still, from the intellectual point of view it is the most profound concept in the whole realm of philosophy. The fact that it is called 'Unknowable' does not mean that it is beyond the range of philosophical or religious thought and something on which thinking is impossible or undesirable. The very fact that it is the heart and the basis of the universe should make it the most intriguing object of enquiry within the realms of the intellect. |I. K. Taimni|''Man, God and the Universe''|Chapter 1&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "core of our being" is [[Freudian]]; see {{Cite journal | author = Bettina Bock von Wülfingen | year = 2013 | title = Freud's 'Core of our Being' Between Cytology and Psychoanalysis | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bewi.201301604/pdf | journal = Berichte zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 226–244 | doi = 10.1002/bewi.201301604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Aldous Huxley says:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Perennial Philosophy|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|year=1945|isbn=978-0-06-172494-7|location=United States|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|text=Only the transcendent, the completely other, can be immanent without being modified by the becoming of that in which it dwells. The Perennial Philosophy teaches that it is desirable and indeed necessary to know the spiritual Ground of things, not only within the soul, but also outside in the world and, beyond world and soul, in its transcendent otherness 'in heaven.' ... God within and God without; these are two abstract notions, which can be entertained by the understanding and expressed in words.|sign=Aldous Huxley|source=The Perennial Philosophy}}

Similarly, the Hindu Taimni describes the [[Parabrahman]] as unknowable by the human mind and unthinkable but the highest object of realization and the most profound object of philosophical enquiry.&lt;ref&gt;I. K. Taimni ''Man, God and the Universe'' Quest Books, 1974, p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plotinus]] likewise taught that the goal of philosophy was to "contemplate the One".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/|title=Plotinus - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=|date=|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiencing the Absolute ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Philosophers and religious adherents who aim to pattern their life after the Absolute reality sometimes claim to have experienced the Absolute. They report [[mystical experience]]s, feelings of oneness, transcendence of their everyday personality or of personhood altogether.

=== Representing the Absolute===
[[File:Yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|200px|The Absolute represented as ''[[Yggdrasill]]'' in [[Germanic paganism|Germanic religion]].]]
The Absolute is conceptually defined as something inexpressible and perhaps unthinkable. This concept creates special problems for expression in words, poetry, mythology, and art. Writers, [[Alex Grey|painters]], storytellers, filmmakers&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Terrence Malick]]'s ''Tree of Life'' and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' are two good examples (one religious, one atheistic) of the use of contradiction to convey the Absolute in the final sequences.&lt;/ref&gt; often use paradox or contradiction because of the "contradictory aspect of the ultimate reality".&lt;ref name="Dadosky, 2004. p. 86"&gt;Dadosky, 2004. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Mircea Eliade]], the Absolute can be mediated or [[revelation|revealed]] through [[symbol]]s.&lt;ref name="Dadosky, 2004. p. 85"&gt;Dadosky, 2004. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; For Eliade the "[[Arche|archaic]]" mind is constantly aware of the presence of the Sacred, and for this mind all symbols are [[religion|religious]] (relinking to the Origin). Through symbols human beings can get an immediate "intuition" of certain features of the inexhaustible Sacred. The mind makes use of images to grasp the ultimate reality of things because reality manifests itself in contradictory ways and therefore can't be described in concepts. It is therefore the image as such, as a whole bundle of meaning, that is "true" (faithful, trustworthy).&lt;ref name="Dadosky, 2004. p. 85"/&gt; Eliade says :&lt;ref&gt;Dadosky, 2004. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the ''sacred'' is equivalent to a ''power'', and, in the last analysis, to ''reality''. The sacred is saturated with ''being''. Sacred power means reality and at the same time enduringness and efficacy. The polarity sacred-profane is often expressed as opposition between real and ''unreal'' or pseudoreal. ''[...]'' Thus it is easy to understand that religious man deeply desires ''to be'', to participate in ''reality'', to be saturated with power.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Common symbols of the Absolute include [[world tree]]s, the [[tree of life]], [[macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], [[fire]], children,&lt;ref&gt;See [[George MacDonald]]'s ''The Golden Key''&lt;/ref&gt; [[circles]], [[mandalas]], and the human body.

'''Academic authorship''' of [[academic journal|journal]] [[manuscript|articles]], books, and other original works is a means by which [[academia|academics]] communicate the results of their [[list of academic disciplines|scholarly work]], establish [[scientific priority|priority]] for their discoveries, and build their reputation among their peers.

Authorship is a primary basis that employers use to evaluate academic personnel for employment, promotion, and [[tenure]]. In [[academic publishing]], authorship of a work is claimed by those making intellectual contributions to the completion of the [[research]] described in the work. In simple cases, a solitary scholar carries out a research project and writes the subsequent article or book. In many [[list of academic disciplines|disciplines]], however, [[collaboration]] is the norm and issues of authorship can be controversial. In these contexts, authorship can encompass activities other than writing the article; a researcher who comes up with an experimental design and analyzes the data may be considered an author, even if she or he had little role in composing the text describing the results. According to some standards, even writing the entire article would not constitute authorship unless the writer was also involved in at least one other phase of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dickson |year= 1978 | journal=Wildl.

==Definition==
Guidelines for assigning authorship vary between [[institution]]s and disciplines. They may be formally defined or simply cultural custom. Incorrect application of authorship rules occasionally leads to charges of [[academic dishonesty|academic misconduct]] and sanctions for the violator. A 2002&lt;!--published in 2005--&gt; survey of a large sample of researchers who had received funding from the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] revealed that 10% of respondents claimed to have inappropriately assigned authorship credit within the last three years.&lt;ref name=Martinson2005&gt;{{Cite journal

===Authorship in the natural sciences===
The natural sciences have no universal standard for authorship, but some major multi-disciplinary [[academic journal|journals]] and institutions have established guidelines for work that they publish. The journal ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]'' (''PNAS'') has an editorial policy that specifies "authorship should be limited to those who have contributed substantially to the work" and furthermore, "authors are strongly encouraged to indicate their specific contributions" as a [[footnote]]. The [[American Chemical Society]] further specifies that authors are those who also "share responsibility and accountability for the results"&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/ethics/ethics.pdf Editors of the Publications Division of the American Chemical Society. 2006. Ethical Guidelines to Publication of Chemical Research.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2018}} and the U.S. [[United States National Academies|National Academies]] specify "an author who is willing to take credit for a paper must also bear responsibility for its contents. Thus, unless a footnote or the text of the paper explicitly assigns responsibility for different parts of the paper to different authors, the authors whose names appear on a paper must share responsibility for all of it."&lt;ref name="National"/&gt;

===Authorship in mathematics, theoretical computer science and high energy physics===
In mathematics, the authors are usually listed in alphabetical order (this is the so-called Hardy-Littlewood Rule). This usage is described in the "Information Statements on the Culture of Research and Scholarship in Mathematics" section of the [[American Mathematical Society]] website,&lt;ref name="ams culture"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ams.org/about-us/governance/committees/cprof-home#culture|title = Information Statements|website =  Committee on the Profession|publisher = American Mathematical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically the 2004 statement: ''[http://www.ams.org/profession/leaders/culture/CultureStatement04.pdf Joint Research and Its Publication]''.

In other branches of knowledge such as economics, business, finance or [[particle physics]], it is also usual to sort the authors alphabetically.&lt;ref name="author listing"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waltman | first1 = L | year = 2012 | title = An empirical analysis of the use  of alphabetical authorship in scientific publishing | url = | journal = Journal of Informetrics | volume = 4 | issue = 6| pages = 700–711 | doi = 10.1016/j.joi.2012.07.008 | arxiv = 1206.4863 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authorship in medicine===
The medical field defines authorship very narrowly. According to the [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]], designation as an author must satisfy four conditions. The author must have:
# Contributed substantially to the conception and design of the study, the acquisition of data, or the analysis and interpretation
# Drafted or provided critical revision of the article
# Provided final approval of the version to publish
# Agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved

Acquisition of funding, or general supervision of the research group alone does not constitute authorship. Many authors - especially those in the middle of the byline - do not fulfill these authorship criteria.&lt;ref name="advances.sciencemag.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sauermann|first1=Henry|last2=Haeussler|first2=Carolin|title=Authorship and contribution disclosures|journal=Science Advances|volume=3|issue=11|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/11/e1700404.full|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1700404|year=2017|page=e1700404|bibcode=2017SciA....3E0404S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some medical journals have abandoned the strict notion of author, with the flexible notion of ''contributor''.&lt;ref name=Rennie1997&gt;{{Cite journal

| doi = 10.1001/jama.278.7.579
| pmid = 9268280
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between about 1980-2010 the average number of authors in medical papers increased, and perhaps tripled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsao|first1=CI|last2=Roberts|first2=LW|title=Authorship in scholarly manuscripts: practical considerations for resident and early career physicians.|journal=Academic Psychiatry |date= |volume=33|issue=1|pages=76–9|pmid=19349451|doi=10.1176/appi.ap.33.1.76|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authorship in the social sciences===
The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) has similar guidelines as medicine for authorship. The APA acknowledge that authorship is not limited to the writing of manuscripts, but must include those who have made substantial contributions to a study such as "formulating the problem or hypothesis, structuring the experimental design, organizing and conducting the statistical analysis, interpreting the results, or writing a major portion of the paper".&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association. (2001). Publication manual of the American Psychological Association (5th ed.). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; While the APA guidelines list many other forms of contributions to a study that do not constitute authorship, it does state that combinations of these and other tasks may justify authorship. Like medicine, the APA considers institutional position, such as Department Chair, insufficient for attributing authorship.

===Authorship in the humanities===
Neither the Modern Languages Association&lt;ref&gt;Gibaldi, J. (1998). ''MLA style manual and guide to scholarly publishing'' (2nd ed.). New York: Modern Language Association of America.&lt;/ref&gt; nor the Chicago Manual of Style&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]|edition = 15th|date =2006|location = Chicago|publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn =  978-0226104041}}&lt;/ref&gt; define requirements for authorship (because usually humanities works are single-authored and the author is responsible for the entire work).

==Growing number of authors per paper==
From the late 17th century to the 1920s, sole authorship was the norm, and the one-paper-one-author model worked well for distributing credit.&lt;ref name="Greene2007"/&gt; Today, shared authorship is common in most academic disciplines, with the exception of the humanities, where sole authorship is still the predominant model. In particular types of research, including particle physics, genome sequencing and clinical trials, a paper's author list can run into the hundreds. In 1998, the [[Collider Detector at Fermilab]] (CDF) adopted a (at that time) highly unorthodox policy for assigning authorship. CDF maintains a ''standard author list''. All scientists and engineers working at CDF are added to the standard author list after one year of full-time work; names stay on the list until one year after the worker leaves CDF. Every publication coming out of CDF uses the entire standard author list, in alphabetical order. Other big collaborations, including most particle physics experiments, followed this model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.sciencewatch.com/newsletter/2012/201207/multiauthor_papers/|title=Multiauthor Papers: Onward and Upward|author=Christopher King|date=July 2012|accessdate=6 December 2017|work = ScienceWatch Newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In large, multi-center clinical trials authorship is often used as a reward for recruiting patients.&lt;ref name="Regalado1995"/&gt;

A paper published in the [[The New England Journal of Medicine|New England Journal of Medicine]] in 1993 reported on a clinical trial conducted in 1,081 hospitals in 15 different countries, involving a total of 41,021 patients. There were 972 authors listed in an appendix and authorship was assigned to a group.&lt;ref name="Investigators1993"/&gt; In 2015, an article in high-energy physics was published describing the measurement of the mass of the [[Higgs boson]] based on collisions in the [[Large Hadron Collider]]; the article boasted 5,154 authors, the printed author list needed 24 pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nature.com/news/physics-paper-sets-record-with-more-than-5-000-authors-1.17567|title=Physics paper sets record with more than 5,000 authors|author=Davide Castelvecchi|date=15 May 2015|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large authors lists have attracted some criticism. They strain guidelines that insist that each author's role be described and that each author is responsible for the validity of the whole work. Such a system treats authorship more as ''credit'' for scientific service at the facility in general rather that as an identification of specific contributions.&lt;ref&gt;Biagioli, M. Rights or rewards? Changing frameworks of scientific authorship. In ''Scientific Authorship'', Biagioli, M. and Galison, P. eds. Routledge, New York, 2003, pp. 253–280.&lt;/ref&gt; One commentator wrote, "In more than 25 years working as a scientific editor ... I have not been aware of any valid argument for more than three authors per paper, although I recognize that this may not be true for every field."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/37855 | pmid = 9288957 | year = 1997 | last1 = Van Loon | first1 = A. J. | title = Pseudo-authorship | journal = Nature | volume = 389 | issue = 6646 | pages = 11 |bibcode = 1997Natur.389...11V }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of shared authorship has been attributed to [[Big Science]]—scientific experiments that require collaboration and specialization of many individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Price|first= Derek John de Solla |date = 1986|chapter = Collaboration in an Invisible College|title = Little science, big science...and beyond |pages = 119–134|location= New York|publisher = Columbia University Press|url = http://www.andreasaltelli.eu/file/repository/Little_science_big_science_and_beyond.pdf |isbn = 0-231-04956-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, the increase in multi-authorship might be a consequence of the way scientists are evaluated. Traditionally, scientists were judged by the number of papers they published, and later by the impact of those papers. The former is an estimate of quantity and the latter of quality. Both methods were adequate when single authorship was the norm, but vastly inflate individual contribution when papers are multi-authored. When each author claims each paper and each citation as his/her own, papers and citations are magically multiplied by the number of authors. Furthermore, there is no cost to giving authorship to individuals who made only minor contribution and, actually, there is an incentive to do so. Hence, the system rewards heavily multi-authored papers. This problem is openly acknowledged, and it could easily be "corrected" by dividing each paper and its citations by the number of authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Põder E | year = 2010 | title = Let's correct that small mistake | url = | journal = J. Am. Soc. Inform. Sci. Tech | volume = 61 | issue = 12| pages = 2593–2594 | doi = 10.1002/asi.21438 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lozano | first1 = G. A. | year = 2013 | title = The elephant in the room: multi-authorship and the assessment of individual researchers | url = | journal = Current Science | volume = 105 | issue = 4| pages = 443–445 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the rise in shared authorship may also reflect increased acknowledgment of the contributions of lower level workers, including graduate students and technicians, as well as honorary authorship, while allowing for such collaborations to make an independent statement about the quality and integrity of a scientific work.

==Honorary authorship==
''Honorary authorship'' is sometimes granted to those who played no significant role in the work, for a variety of reasons. Until recently, it was standard to list the head of a German department or institution as an author on a paper regardless of input.&lt;ref name="Pearson, H 2006"/&gt; The [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], however, warns that such practices "dilute the credit due the people who actually did the work, inflate the credentials of those so 'honored,' and make the proper attribution of credit more difficult."&lt;ref name=National/&gt; The extent to which honorary authorship still occurs is not empirically known. However, it is plausible to expect that it is still widespread, because senior scientists leading large research groups can receive much of their reputation from a long publication list and thus have little motivation to give up honorary authorships.

A possible measure against honorary authorships has been implemented by some scientific journals, in particular by the ''Nature'' journals. They demand&lt;ref name="NaturePolicies"/&gt; that each new manuscript must include a statement of responsibility that specifies the contribution of every author. The level of detail varies between the disciplines. Senior persons may still make some vague claim to have "supervised the project", for example, even if they were only in the formal position of a supervisor without having delivered concrete contributions. (The truth content of such statements is usually not checked by independent persons.) However, the need to describe contributions can at least be expected to somewhat reduce honorary authorships. In addition, it may help to identify the perpetrator in a case of scientific fraud.

==Ghost authorship==
''Ghost authorship'' occurs when an individual makes a substantial contribution to the research or the writing of the report, but is not listed as an author.&lt;ref name="Ghost authorship in industry-initiated randomised trials"/&gt; Researchers, statisticians and writers (e.g. [[medical writer]]s or [[technical writers]]) become ''ghost authors'' when they meet authorship criteria but are not named as an author. Writers who work in this capacity are called [[Ghostwriting#Academic|ghostwriters]].

Ghost authorship has been linked to partnerships between industry and higher education. Two-thirds of industry-initiated [[randomized controlled trial|randomized trials]] may have evidence of ghost authorship.&lt;ref name="Ghost authorship in industry-initiated randomised trials"/&gt;
Ghost authorship is considered problematic because it may be used to obscure the participation of researchers with conflicts of interest.&lt;ref name="Handling of scientific dishonesty in the Nordic countries. National Committees on Scientific Dishonesty in the Nordic Countries"/&gt;

Litigation against the pharmaceutical company, [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]] over health concerns related to use of their drug, [[Rofecoxib]] (brand name Vioxx), revealed examples of ghost authorship.&lt;ref name=Ross2008&gt;{{Cite journal
| last1 = Ross | first1 = Joseph S.
| last2 = Hill | first2 = Kevin P.
| last3 = Egilman | first3 = David S.
| last4 = Krumholz | first4 = Harlan M.
| year = 2008
| title = Guest Authorship and Ghostwriting in Publications Related to Rofecoxib: A Case Study of Industry Documents from Rofecoxib Litigation
| journal = JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association
| volume = 299
| issue = 15
| pages = 1800–12
| doi = 10.1001/jama.299.15.1800
| pmid = 18413874
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Merck routinely paid medical writing companies to prepare journal manuscripts, and subsequently recruited external, academically affiliated researchers to pose as the authors.

Authors are sometimes included in a list without their permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nmat1264 | title = Authorship without authorization | pmid = 15516947 | year = 2004 | journal = Nature Materials | volume = 3 | issue = 11 | page = 743|bibcode = 2004NatMa...3..743. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even if this is done with the benign intention to acknowledge some contributions, it is problematic since authors carry responsibility for correctness and thus need to have the opportunity to check the manuscript and possibly demand changes.

==Order of authors in a list==
Rules for the order of multiple authors in a list have historically varied significantly between fields of research.&lt;ref name="On Academic Authorship (RPH 2.8)"/&gt; Some fields list authors in order of their degree of involvement in the work, with the most active contributors listed first;&lt;ref name="advances.sciencemag.org"/&gt; other fields, such as mathematics or engineering (e.g., [[control theory]]), sometimes list them alphabetically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/40958 | pmid = 9237742 | year = 1997 | last1 = Stubbs | first1 = C. | title = The serious business of listing authors. | journal = Nature | volume = 388 | issue = 6640 | page = 320 |bibcode = 1997Natur.388Q.320. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EPAC96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ICALEPCS99"/&gt; Historically biologists tended to place a [[principal investigator]] (supervisor or lab head) last in an author list whereas organic chemists might have put him or her first.&lt;ref name="Pearson, H 2006"/&gt; Research articles in high energy physics, where the author lists can number in the tens to hundreds, often list authors alphabetically.  In Computer Science in general the principal contributor is the first in the author list. However, the practice of putting the principal investigator last in the author list has increasingly become an accepted standard across most areas in science and engineering.{{Citation needed|reason=Is there data to back this up?|date=September 2017}}

Although listing authors in order of the involvement in the project seems straightforward, it often leads to conflict. A study in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that more than two-thirds of 919 corresponding authors disagreed with their coauthors regarding contributions of each author.&lt;ref name="Reliability of disclosure forms of authors' contributions"/&gt;

==Responsibilities of authors==
Authors' reputations can be damaged if their names appear on a paper that they do not completely understand or with which they were not intimately involved.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Numerous guidelines and customs specify that all co-authors must be able to understand and support a paper's major points.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In a notable case, American stem-cell researcher [[Gerald Schatten]] had his name listed on a paper co-authored with [[Hwang Woo-suk]]. The paper was later exposed as fraudulent and, though Schatten was not accused of participating in the fraud, a panel at his university found that "his failure to more closely oversee research with his name on it does make him guilty of 'research misbehavior.'"&lt;ref&gt;Holden, Constance. (2006.) Schatten: Pitt Panel Finds "Misbehavior" but Not Misconduct. ''Science'', '''311''':928.&lt;/ref&gt;

All authors, including co-authors, are usually expected to have made reasonable attempts to check findings submitted for publication. In some cases, co-authors of faked research have been accused of inappropriate behavior or research misconduct for failing to verify reports authored by others or by a commercial sponsor. Examples include the case of Professor Geoffrey Chamberlain named as guest author of  papers fabricated by Malcolm Pearce,&lt;ref name="Lessons from the Pearce affair: handling scientific fraud"/&gt; (Chamberlain was exonerated from collusion in Pearce's deception)&lt;ref name="Independent Committee of Inquiry into the publication of articles in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Independent Committee of Inquiry into the publication of articles in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (1994-1995) |url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cats/7/4972.htm |accessdate=2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and the co-authors of [[Jan Hendrik Schön]] at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]]. More recent cases include [[Charles Nemeroff]],&lt;ref name="Journal editor quits in conflict scandal - The Scientist - Magazine of the Life Sciences"/&gt; former editor-in-chief of ''[[Neuropsychopharmacology]]'', and the so-called Sheffield Actonel affair.&lt;ref name="Actonel_Case_Media_Reports"/&gt;

Additionally, authors are expected to keep all study data for later examination even after publication. Both scientific and academic censure can result from a failure to keep primary data; the case of [[Ranjit Chandra]] of [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] provides an example of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Memorial University to re-examine Chandra case|url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/memorial-university-to-re-examine-chandra-case-1.575308|website = www.cbc.ca|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scientific journals also require that authors provide information to allow readers to determine whether the authors may have commercial or non-commercial [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]]. Outlined in the author disclosure statement for the ''[[American Journal of Human Biology]]'',&lt;ref name="American Journal of Human Biology - Wiley InterScience"/&gt; this is a policy more common in scientific fields where funding often comes from corporate sources. Authors are also commonly required to provide information about [[research ethics|ethical]] aspects of research, particularly where research involves human or animal participants or use of biological material. Provision of incorrect information to journals may be regarded as misconduct. Financial pressures on universities have encouraged this type of misconduct. The majority of recent cases of alleged misconduct involving undisclosed conflicts of interest or failure of the authors to have seen scientific data involve collaborative research between scientists and biotechnology companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2133061/ |title=Did a British university sell out to P&amp;G? - By Jennifer Washburn - Slate Magazine |work= |accessdate=2010-04-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100323070938/http://www.slate.com/id/2133061/| archivedate= 23 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anonymous and unclaimed authorship==
Authors occasionally forgo claiming authorship, for a number of reasons. Historically some authors have published anonymously to shield themselves when presenting controversial claims. A key example is [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]]' anonymous publication of [[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]], a speculative, pre-Darwinian work on the origins of life and the cosmos. The book argued for an evolutionary view of life in the same spirit as the late Frenchman [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]. Lamarck had long been discredited among intellectuals by this time and evolutionary (or development) theories were exceedingly unpopular, except among the political radicals, materialists, and atheists - Chambers hoped to avoid Lamarck's fate.

In the 18th century, [[Émilie du Châtelet]] began her career as a scientific author by submitting a paper in an annual competition held by the [[French Academy of Sciences]]; papers in this competition were submitted anonymously. Initially presenting her work without claiming authorship allowed her to have her work judged by established scientists while avoiding the bias against women in the sciences. She did not win the competition, but eventually her paper was published alongside the winning submissions, under her real name.&lt;ref&gt;Terrall, M. The uses of anonymity in the age of reason. In ''Scientific Authorship'' Biagioli, M. and Galison, P. eds. Routledge, New York, 2003, pp. 91–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists and engineers working in corporate and military organizations are often restricted from publishing and claiming authorship of their work because their results are considered secret property of the organization that employs them. One notable example is that of [[William Gosset]], who was forced to publish his work in statistics under the pseudonym “Student” due to his employment at the [[Guinness]] brewery. Another account describes the frustration of physicists working in nuclear weapons programs at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Lawrence Livermore Laboratory]] – years after making a discovery they would read of the same phenomenon being "discovered" by a physicist unaware of the original, secret discovery of the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Gusterson, H. The death of the authors of death - Prestige and creativity among nuclear weapons scientists. In ''Scientific Authorship'' Biagioli, M. and Galison, P. eds. Routledge, New York, 2003, pp. 282–307.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alanus University of Arts and Social Sciences''' (''Alanus Hochschule für Kunst und Gesellschaft'') is a state-accredited private [[university]] in [[Alfter]] (near [[Bonn]]), Germany, providing education in [[the arts]] and [[social sciences]] up to doctorate level. It has offered accredited arts degrees since 2003 and other degrees since 2006. In 2010, the university was awarded institutional accreditation and the right to award doctorates by the [[German Council of Science and Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mastersportal.eu/students/browse/university/967/alanus-university-of-arts-and-social-sciences.html Alanus University of Arts and Social Sciences] mastersportal.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

The university was founded as an [[anthroposophy|anthroposophical]] [[art school]] in 1973. In cooperation with [[Rudolf Steiner University College]], it publishes the international academic journal ''[[Research on Steiner Education]]''.

An '''allegiance''' is a duty of fidelity said to be owed, or freely committed, by the people, [[British subject|subjects]] or [[citizen]]s to their [[state (polity)|state]] or [[Monarch|sovereign]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/allegiance&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
From Middle English ''ligeaunce'' (see medieval Latin ''ligeantia'', "a  liegance"). The ''al-'' prefix was probably added through confusion with another legal term, ''allegeance'', an "allegation" (the French ''allegeance'' comes from the English). ''Allegiance'' is formed from "liege," from [[Old French]] ''liege'', "liege, free", of Germanic origin. The connection with [[Latin]] ''ligare'', "to bind," is erroneous.&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Allegiance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Traditionally, English legal commentators used the term ''allegiance'' in two ways. In one sense, it referred to the deference which anyone, even foreigners, was expected to pay to the institutions of the country where one lived. In the other sense, it meant national character{{clarify|date=October 2016}} and the subjection{{clarify|date=October 2016}} due to that character.&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911"/&gt;

==Types==
* Local allegiance&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/local%20allegiance&lt;/ref&gt;
* Natural allegiance&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural%20allegiance&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
The English doctrine, which was at one time adopted in the United States, asserted that allegiance was indelible: "Nemo potest exuere patriam". As the law stood prior to 1870, every person who by birth or [[naturalisation]] satisfied the conditions set forth, (though he should be removed in infancy to another country where his family resided), owed an allegiance to the British crown which he/she could never resign or lose, except by act of parliament or by the recognition of the independence or the cession of the portion of British territory in which he resided.&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911"/&gt;

This refusal to accept any [[Renunciation of citizenship|renunciation]] of allegiance to the Crown led to conflict with the United States over [[impressment]], which led to further conflicts during the [[War of 1812]], when thirteen Irish American [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] were executed as [[traitor]]s after the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]]; [[Winfield Scott]] urged American [[reprisal]], but none was carried out.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Eisenhower]] (1997), ''Agent of Destiny:  The Life and Times of Winfield Scott'', New York:  Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegiance is the tie which binds the subject to the [[Monarch|Sovereign]] in return for that protection which the Sovereign affords the subject. It was the mutual bond and obligation between monarch and subjects, whereby subjects are called his liege subjects, because they are bound to obey and serve him; and he is called their liege lord, because he should maintain and defend them (''Ex parte Anderson'' (1861) 3 El &amp; El 487; 121 ER 525; ''China Navigation Co v Attorney-General'' (1932) 48 TLR 375; ''Attorney-General v Nissan'' [1969] 1 All ER 629; ''[[Oppenheimer v Cattermole]]'' [1972] 3 All ER 1106). The duty of the Crown towards its subjects is to govern and protect. The reciprocal duty of the subject towards the Crown is that of allegiance.

At common law, allegiance is a true and faithful obedience of the subject due to his Sovereign. As the subject owes to his king his true and faithful allegiance and obedience, so the Sovereign

* ''duplex et reciprocum ligamen; quia sicut subditus regi tenetur ad obedientiam, ita rex subdito tenetur ad protectionem; merito igitur ligeantia dicitur a ligando, quia continet in se duplex ligamen'' (''Calvin's Case'' (1608) 7 Co Rep 1a; Jenk 306; 2 State Tr 559; 77 ER 377).

Natural allegiance and obedience is an incident inseparable to every subject, for parte Anderson (1861) 3 El &amp; El 487; 121 ER 525). Natural-born subjects owe allegiance wherever they may be. Where territory is occupied in the course of hostilities by an enemy's force, even if the annexation of the occupied country is proclaimed by the enemy, there can be no change of allegiance during the progress of hostilities on the part of a citizen of the occupied country (''R v Vermaak'' (1900) 21 NLR 204 (South Africa)).

Allegiance is owed both to the Sovereign as a natural person  and to the Sovereign in the political capacity (''Re Stepney Election Petition, Isaacson v Durant'' (1886) 17 QBD 54 (per [[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|Lord Coleridge]] CJ)). Attachment to the person of the reigning Sovereign is not sufficient. Loyalty requires affection also to the office of the Sovereign, attachment to royalty, attachment to the law and to the constitution of the realm, and he who would, by force or by fraud, endeavour to prostrate that law and constitution, though he may retain his affection for its head, can boast but an imperfect and spurious species of loyalty (''R v O'Connell'' (1844) 7 ILR 261).

There were four kinds of allegiances (''Rittson v Stordy'' (1855) 3 Sm &amp; G 230; ''De Geer v Stone'' (1882) 22 Ch D 243; ''Isaacson v Durant'' (1886) 54 LT 684; ''Gibson, Gavin v Gibson'' [1913] 3 KB 379; ''Joyce v DPP'' [1946] AC 347; ''Collingwood v Pace'' (1661) O Bridg 410; ''Lane v Bennett'' (1836) 1 M &amp; W 70; ''Lyons Corp v East India Co'' (1836) 1 Moo PCC 175; ''Birtwhistle v Vardill'' (1840) 7 Cl &amp; Fin 895; ''R v Lopez, R v Sattler'' (1858) Dears &amp; B 525; Ex p Brown (1864) 5 B &amp; S 280);

(a) ''Ligeantia naturalis, absoluta, pura et indefinita'', and this originally is due by nature and birthright, and is called ''alta ligeantia'', and those that owe this are called ''subditus natus'';

(b) ''Ligeantia acquisita'', not by nature but by acquisition or denization, being called a denizen, or rather denizon, because they are ''subditus datus'';

(c) ''Ligeantia localis'', by operation of law, when a friendly alien enters the country, because so long as they are in the country they are within the Sovereign's protection, therefore they owe the Sovereign a local obedience or allegiance (''R v Cowle'' (1759) 2 Burr 834; ''Low v Routledge'' (1865) 1 Ch App 42; ''Re Johnson, Roberts v Attorney-General'' [1903] 1 Ch 821; ''Tingley v Muller'' [1917] 2 Ch 144; ''Rodriguez v Speyer'' [1919] AC 59; ''Johnstone v Pedlar'' [1921] 2 AC 262; ''R v Tucker'' (1694) Show Parl Cas 186; ''R v Keyn'' (1876) 2 Ex  D 63; ''Re Stepney Election Petn, Isaacson v Durant'' (1886) 17 QBD 54);

(d) A legal obedience, where a particular law requires the taking of an oath of allegiance by subject or alien alike.

Natural allegiance was acquired by birth within the Sovereign's dominions (except for the issue of diplomats or of invading forces or of an alien in an enemy occupied territory). The natural allegiance and obedience are an incident inseparable from every subject, for as soon as they are born they owe by birthright allegiance and obedience to the Sovereign (''Ex p. Anderson'' (1861) 3 E &amp; E 487). A natural-born subject owes allegiance wherever they may be, so that where territory is occupied in the course of hostilities by an enemy's force, even if the annexation of the occupied country is proclaimed by the enemy, there can be no change of allegiance during the progress of hostilities on the part of a citizen of the occupied country (''R v Vermaak'' (1900) 21 NLR 204 (South Africa)).

Acquired allegiance was acquired by naturalisation or denization. Denization, or ''ligeantia acquisita'', appears to be threefold (''Thomas v Sorrel'' (1673) 3 Keb 143);

* (a) absolute, as the common denization, without any limitation or restraint;
* (b) limited, as when the Sovereign grants letters of denization to an alien, and the alien's male heirs, or to an alien for the term of their life;
* (c) It may be granted upon condition, ''cujus est dare, ejus est disponere'', and this denization of an alien may come about three ways: by Parliament; by letters patent, which was the usual manner; and by conquest.

Local allegiance was due by an alien while in the protection of the Crown. All friendly resident aliens incurred all the obligations of subjects (''The Angelique'' (1801) 3 Ch Rob App 7). An alien, coming into a colony also became, temporarily a subject of the Crown, and acquired rights both within and beyond the colony, and these latter rights could not be affected by the laws of that colony (''Routledge v Low'' (1868) LR 3 HL 100; 37 LJ Ch 454; 18 LT 874; 16 WR 1081, HL; ''Reid v Maxwell'' (1886) 2 TLR 790; ''Falcon v Famous Players Film Co'' [1926] 2 KB 474).

A resident alien owed allegiance even when the protection of the Crown was withdrawn owing to the occupation of an enemy, because the absence of the Crown's protection was temporary and involuntary (''de Jager v Attorney-General of Natal'' [1907] AC 326).

Legal allegiance was due when an alien took an oath of allegiance required for a particular office under the Crown.

By the [[Naturalisation Act 1870]], it was made possible for British subjects to renounce their nationality and allegiance, and the ways in which that nationality is lost are defined. So British subjects voluntarily naturalized in a foreign state are deemed aliens from the time of such naturalization, unless, in the case of persons naturalized before the passing of the act, they have declared their desire to remain British subjects within two years from the passing of the act. Persons who from having been born within British territory are British subjects, but who at birth became under the law of any foreign state subjects of such state, and also persons who though born abroad are British subjects by reason of parentage, may by declarations of alienage get rid of British nationality. Emigration to an uncivilized country leaves British nationality unaffected: indeed the right claimed by all states to follow with their authority their subjects so emigrating is one of the usual and recognized means of [[Colonialism|colonial]] expansion.&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911"/&gt;

==United States==
The doctrine that no man can cast off his native allegiance without the consent of his sovereign was early abandoned in the United States, and [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Rutledge]] also declared in [[Talbot v. Janson]], "a man may, at the same time, enjoy the rights of citizenship under two governments."&lt;ref&gt;3 U.S. 133, www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0003_Z04.html  .&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 27, 1868, the day before the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] was adopted, [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] declared in the preamble of the [[Expatriation Act of 1868|Expatriation Act]] that "the right of [[expatriation]] is a natural and inherent right of all people, indispensable to the enjoyment of the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," and (Section I) one of "the fundamental principles of this government" ([[United States Revised Statutes]], sec. 1999). Every natural-born citizen of a foreign state who is also an American citizen and every natural-born American citizen who is a citizen of a foreign land owes a double allegiance, one to the United States, and one to his homeland (in the event of an immigrant becoming a citizen of the US), or to his adopted land (in the event of an emigrant natural born citizen of the  US becoming a citizen of another nation). If these allegiances come into conflict, he or she may be guilty of treason against one or both. If the demands of these two sovereigns upon his duty of allegiance come into conflict, those of the United States have the paramount authority in American law;&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911"/&gt; likewise, those of the foreign land have paramount authority in their legal system. In such a situation, it may be incumbent on the individual to [[Renunciation of citizenship|renounce]] one of his citizenships to avoid possibly being forced into situations where countervailing duties are required of him, such as might occur in the event of war.

==Oath of allegiance==
{{main|Oath of allegiance}}
The oath of allegiance is an [[oath]] of fidelity to the sovereign taken by all persons holding important public office and as a condition of naturalization. By ancient common law, it might be required of all persons above the age of 12, and it was repeatedly used as a test for the disaffected. In England, it was first imposed by statute in the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England]] (1558) and its form has more than once been altered since. Up to the time of the revolution, the promise was, "to be true and faithful to the king and his heirs, and truth and faith to bear of life and limb and terrene [[honour]], and not to know or hear of any ill or damage intended him without defending him therefrom." This was thought to favour the doctrine of absolute non-resistance, and accordingly, the [[Convention Parliament (England)|Convention Parliament]] enacted the form that has been in use since that time – "I do sincerely promise and swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty ..."&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911"/&gt;

In the United States and some other republics, the oath is known as the Pledge of Allegiance. Instead of declaring fidelity to a monarch, the pledge is made to the flag, the republic, and to the core values of the country, specifically [[liberty]] and [[justice]]. The reciting of the pledge in the United States is [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)#Legal challenges|voluntary]] because of the rights guaranteed to the people under the [[First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/319/624|title=West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Islam{{anchor|Bayat}}==
{{main|Bay'ah}}
The word used in the Arabic language for allegiance is ''bay'at'' (Arabic: بيعة), which means "taking hand". The practice is sanctioned in the [[Quran]] by Surah 48:10: "Verily, those who give thee their allegiance, they give it but to Allah Himself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Whitehouse| first = Bill| title = Reality Without A Name| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yVUCCnhTiHcC&amp;pg=PA266| format = PDF: Google Books| accessdate = 2008-03-31| publisher = Bilquees Press| isbn = 0-9680995-6-4| page = 266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is used for the [[oath]] of allegiance to an [[emir]]. It is also used for the initiation ceremony specific to many [[Sufi]] orders.

===Appeals to authorities===

Historically, opinion on the appeal to authority has been divided: it is listed as a valid argument as often as a fallacious argument in various sources,&lt;ref name="Logic and the Common law Trial"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Underwood|first1=R.H.|title=Logic and the Common law Trial|journal=[[American Journal of Trial Advocacy]]|date=1994|page=166|url=http://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1258&amp;context=law_facpub}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some holding that it is a strong argument&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.critical-thinking.org.uk/critical-thinking/fallacies/appeal-to-authority.php]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merrilee"&gt;Salmon, Merrilee ''Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking'' (2012) Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The ethics of protocells|last=Bedau|first=Mark|publisher=Mit Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-262-01262-1|location=Boston, Massachusetts; London, England|pages=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; which "has a legitimate force",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodwin|first1=Jean|last2=McKerrow|first2=Raymie|title=Accounting for the force of the appeal to authority|journal=OSSA Conference Archive|date=2011|url=http://scholar.uwindsor.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=ossaarchive}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others that it is weak or an outright fallacy&lt;ref name = "skepdic_old"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Robert|title=Appeal to Authority|url=http://www.skepdic.com/authorty.html|website=The Skeptic's Dictionary|ref=skepdic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woodward|first1=Ian|title=Ignorance is Contagious|url=http://www.geol.utas.edu.au/geography/EIANZ/Ignorance_is_contagious_%28July_2008%29.pdf|publisher=University of Tasmania}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sadler"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadler|first1=Troy|title=Promoting Discourse and Argumentation in Science Teacher Education|journal=Journal of Science Teacher Education|date=2006|doi=10.1007/s10972-006-9025-4|volume=17|issue=4|pages=323–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knight|first1=Sue|last2=Collins|first2=Carol|title=The Cultivation of Reason Giving|journal=International Journal of the Humanities|date=2005|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/abstract?&amp;authtype=crawler&amp;jrnl=14479508&amp;AN=25038782&amp;h=sWDEg2RMGhbfqaDCp464Y5XAO3vdCZAgW0WIY4qbGiCjVmjhsyD1Jk32%2baByC8MqBDqu3SxDr7URVV3i9g681Q%3d%3d&amp;crl=c&amp;resultNs=AdminWebAuth&amp;resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&amp;crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d14479508%26AN%3d25038782}}&lt;/ref&gt; where, on a conflict of facts, "mere appeal to authority alone had better be avoided".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Rival Theories of Cholera|journal=Medical Press and Circular|date=1885|volume=90|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBgCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use in science====

Scientific knowledge is best established by evidence and experiment rather than argued through authority&lt;ref name="occultatoms"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McBride|first1=Michael|title=Retrospective Scientific Evaluation|url=https://webspace.yale.edu/chem125/125/history99/8Occult/OccultAtoms.html#ret|publisher=Yale University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Principles_of_Psychology"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zinser|first1=Otto|title=Basic Principles of Experimental Psychology|date=1984|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XcBtP1TpAcUC&amp;q=%22accept+claims+on+the+authority%22&amp;dq=%22accept+claims+on+the+authority%22|isbn=9780070728455}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stephen|first1=Leslie|title=The Science of Ethics|page=viii|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5jA1AQAAMAAJ|year=1882}}&lt;/ref&gt; as authority has no place in science.&lt;ref name="Principles_of_Psychology" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevenson|first1=I.|title=Some of My Journeys in Medicine|date=1990|publisher=The University of Southwestern Louisiana|page=18|url=https://med.virginia.edu/perceptual-studies/wp-content/uploads/sites/360/2015/11/some-of-my-journeys-in-medicine.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quick|first1=James Campbell|last2=Little|first2=Laura M.|last3=Cooper|first3=Cary L.|last4=Gibbs|first4=Philip C.|last5=Nelson|first5=Debra|journal=International Review of Industrial and Organizational Psychology|date=2010|page=278|title=Organizational Behavior|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229724832}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Sagan]] wrote of arguments from authority: &lt;blockquote&gt;One of the great commandments of science is, "Mistrust arguments from authority." ... Too many such arguments have proved too painfully wrong. Authorities must prove their contentions like everybody else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sagan|first1=Carl|title=The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yz8Y6KfXf9UC&amp;q=Arguments+from+authority#v=snippet&amp;q=Arguments%20from%20authority&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]
|date=July 6, 2011 |isbn=9780307801043}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An example of the use of the appeal to authority in science can be seen in 1923, when leading American zoologist [[Theophilus Painter]] declared, based on poor data and conflicting observations he had made,&lt;ref name ="Painter_Account" /&gt;&lt;ref name="48_taught"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mertens|first1=Thomas|title=The Role of Factual Knowledge in Biology Teaching|journal=[[The American Biology Teacher]]|date=October 1979|volume=41|issue=7|doi=10.2307/4446671|url=http://abt.ucpress.edu/content/41/7/395|pages=395–419|jstor=4446671}}&lt;/ref&gt; that humans had 24 pairs of [[chromosomes]]. From the 1920s to the 1950s, this continued to be held based on Painter's authority,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= O'Connor|first= Clare|year= 2008|title= Human Chromosome Number|publisher= Nature|url= http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/Human-Chromosome-Number-294|accessdate= April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gartler|first1=Stanley|title=The Chromosome Number in Humans: A Brief History|journal=[[Nature Reviews Genetics]]|date=2006|volume=7|issue=8|pages=655–60|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/The-chromosome-number-in-humans-a-brief-15575|doi=10.1038/nrg1917|pmid=16847465}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="48_taught" /&gt; despite subsequent counts totaling the [[Chromosome#Human chromosomes|correct number]] of 23.&lt;ref name="Painter_Account"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glass|first1=Bentley|title=Theophilus Shickel Painter|date=1990|publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]]|location=Washington, DC|pages=316–17|url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/painter-theophilus-shickel.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orrell_2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orrell|first1=David PhD.|title=The Future of Everything: The Science of Prediction|date=2008|pages=184–85|title-link=Apollo's Arrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even textbooks&lt;ref name="Painter_Account" /&gt; with photos showing 23 pairs incorrectly declared the number to be 24&lt;ref name="Orrell_2008"/&gt; based on the authority of the then-consensus of 24 pairs.&lt;ref name="Down_Binder"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kevles|first1=Daniel J.|title=Human Chromosomes--Down's Disorder and the Binder's Mistakes|journal=Engineering and Science|date=1985|page=9|url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/594/2/Kevles.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This seemingly established number created [[confirmation bias]] among researchers, and "most cytologists, expecting to detect Painter's number, virtually always did so".&lt;ref name ="Down_Binder"/&gt; Painter's "influence was so great that many scientists preferred to believe his count over the actual evidence",&lt;ref name="Orrell_2008"/&gt; and scientists who obtained the accurate number modified&lt;ref name="Hsudo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=T. C.|first1=Hsu|title=Out of the Dark Ages: Human and Mammalian Cytogenetics: An Historical Perspective|journal=Cell|date=1979|url=http://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/0092-8674%2879%2990249-6.pdf|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(79)90249-6|volume=18|issue=4|pages=1375–1376}}&lt;/ref&gt; or discarded&lt;ref name="Liver"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Unger|first1=Lawrence|last2=Blystone|first2=Robert|title=Paradigm Lost: The Human Chromosome Story|journal=[[Bioscene]]|date=1996|url=http://amcbt.indstate.edu/volume_22/v22-2p3-9.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; their data to agree with Painter's count.

A more recent example involved the "[[When contact changes minds|When contact changes minds: An experiment on transmission of support for gay equality]]" paper. The paper was a fraud based on forged data, yet concerns about it were ignored in many cases due to appeals to authority. One analysis of the affair notes that "Over and over again, throughout the scientific community and the media, LaCour’s impossible-seeming results were treated as truth, in part because of the weight [the study's co-author] [[Donald Green|Green]]’s name carried".&lt;ref name="Gay Marriage Fraud"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singal|first1=Jesse|title=The Case of the Amazing Gay-Marriage Data: How a Graduate Student Reluctantly Uncovered a Huge Scientific Fraud|url=https://www.thecut.com/2015/05/how-a-grad-student-uncovered-a-huge-fraud.html|publisher=The Cut|date=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One psychologist stated his reaction to the paper was "that’s very surprising and doesn’t fit with a huge literature of evidence. It doesn’t sound plausible to me... [then I pull it up and] I see [[Donald Green|Don Green]] is an author. I trust him completely, so I’m no longer doubtful". The forger, LaCour, would use appeals to authority to defend his research: "if his responses sometimes seemed to lack depth when he was pressed for details, his impressive connections often allayed concerns", with one of his partners stating "when he and I really had a disagreement, he would often rely on the kind of arguments where he’d basically invoke authority, right? He’s the one with advanced training, and his adviser is this very high-powered, very experienced person...and they know a lot more than we do".&lt;ref name="Gay Marriage Fraud"/&gt;

Much like the erroneous chromosome number taking decades to refute until microscopy made the error unmistakable, the one who would go on to debunk this paper "was consistently told by friends and advisers to keep quiet about his concerns lest he earn a reputation as a troublemaker", up until "the very last moment when multiple 'smoking guns' finally appeared", and he found that "There was almost no encouragement for him to probe the hints of weirdness he’d uncovered".&lt;ref name="Gay Marriage Fraud"/&gt;

=== {{anchor|False authority}} Appeal to non-authorities ===

Fallacious arguments from [[authority]] are also frequently the result of citing a non-authority as an authority.&lt;ref name="skepdic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/authorty.html|title=Appeal to Authority|ref=skepdic|last1=Carroll|first1=Robert|website=[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the fallacy of appealing to an authority in an unrelated field would be citing [[Albert Einstein]] as an authority for a determination on religion when his primary expertise was in [[physics]].&lt;ref name="skepdic" /&gt; The body of attributed authorities might not even welcome their citation, such as with the "More Doctors Smoke [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]]s" ad campaign.&lt;ref&gt;https://csts.ua.edu/files/2016/09/1983-When-More-Doctors-Smoked-Camels-Cigarette-advertising-in-the-Journal-NYSJM.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a fallacious ''[[ad hominem]]'' argument to argue that a person presenting statements lacks authority and thus their arguments do not need to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williamson|first1=Owen|title=Master List of Logical Fallacies|url=http://utminers.utep.edu/omwilliamson/ENGL1311/fallacies.htm|publisher=[[The University of Texas at El Paso]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As appeals to a perceived lack of authority, these types of argument are fallacious for much the same reasons as an appeal to authority.

Other related fallacious arguments assume that a person without status or authority is inherently reliable. For instance, the [[appeal to poverty]] is the fallacy of thinking that someone is more likely to be correct because they are poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruggiero|first1=Tim|title=Logical Fallacies|url=http://www.philosophicalsociety.com/Logical%20Fallacies.htm#argumentum%20ad%20lazarum%20--%20The%20fallacy%20of%20supposing%20a%20conclusion%20is%20valid%20because%20the%20argument%20is%20made%20by%20a%20poor%20person.%20It%20is%20the%20opposite%20of%20the%20ad%20crumenam%20fallacy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an argument holds that a conclusion is likely to be true precisely because the one who holds or is presenting it lacks authority, it is a fallacious ''appeal to the common man''.&lt;ref name="Common_man_ref"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bennett|first1=B.|title=Appeal to the Common Man|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/24-appeal-to-common-folk|website=Logically Fallacious}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cognitive bias ==
The argument from authority is based on the idea that a perceived authority must know better and that the person should conform to their opinion. This has its roots in psychological [[cognitive biases]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi = 10.1057/9780230297616_5|chapter = Social Influence: Modes and Modalities|title = The Social Psychology of Communication|pages = 87–106|year = 2011|last1 = Sammut|first1 = Gordon|last2 = Bauer|first2 = Martin W|isbn = 978-0-230-24736-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Asch effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Delameter|first1=Andrew|title=Contrasting Scientific &amp; Non-Scientific Approaches to Acquiring Knowledge|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Xu_Mcci-vPsJ:academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/psych/delam/53.1/Lecture1.pptx+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us|agency=City University of New York|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheldon|first1=Brian|last2=Macdonald|first2=Geraldine|title=A Textbook of Social Work|date=2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dt6NAgAAQBAJ|publisher=Routledge|page=40|isbn=9781135282615}}&lt;/ref&gt; In repeated and modified instances of the [[Asch conformity experiments]], it was found that high-status individuals create a stronger likelihood of a subject agreeing with an obviously false conclusion, despite the subject normally being able to clearly see that the answer was incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= McLeod| first= Samuel| year= 2008| title= Asch Experiment| publisher= Simply Psychology|url= http://www.simplypsychology.org/asch-conformity.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, humans have been shown to feel strong emotional pressure to conform to authorities and majority positions. A repeat of the experiments by another group of researchers found that "Participants reported considerable [[Stress (psychological)|distress]] under the group pressure", with 59% conforming at least once and agreeing with the clearly incorrect answer, whereas the incorrect answer was much more rarely given when no such pressures were present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Webley| first= Paul| title= A partial and non-evaluative history of the Asch effect| publisher=[[University of Exeter]]|url= http://people.exeter.ac.uk/PWebley/psy1002/asch.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study shining light on the psychological basis of the fallacy as it relates to perceived authorities are the [[Milgram experiments]], which demonstrated that people are more likely to go along with something when it is presented by an authority.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Milgram | first1 = S | year = 1965 | title = Some conditions of obedience and disobedience to authority | url = | journal = Human Relations | volume = 18 | issue = 1| pages = 57–76 | doi=10.1177/001872676501800105}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a variation of a study where the researchers did not wear a lab coat, thus reducing the perceived authority of the tasker, the obedience level dropped to 20% from the original rate, which had been higher than 50%. Obedience is encouraged by reminding the individual of what a perceived authority states and by showing them that their opinion goes against this authority.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Scholars have noted that certain environments can produce an ideal situation for these processes to take hold, giving rise to [[groupthink]].&lt;ref&gt;https://disruptedphysician.com/2014/12/page/2/&lt;/ref&gt; In groupthink, individuals in a group feel inclined to minimize conflict and encourage conformity. Through an appeal to authority, a group member might present that opinion as a consensus and encourage the other group members to engage in groupthink by not disagreeing with this perceived consensus or authority.&lt;ref&gt;Definition of GROUPTHINK. (2017). Merriam-webster.com. Retrieved from https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/groupthink&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rossi|first1=Stacey (2006)|title=Examination of Exclusion Rates in Massachusetts Public Schools|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED492086.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; One paper about the philosophy of mathematics for example notes that, within academia, &lt;blockquote&gt;If...a person accepts our discipline, and goes through two or three years of [[graduate study]] in mathematics, he absorbs our way of thinking, and is no longer the critical outsider he once was...If the student is unable to absorb our way of thinking, we flunk him out, of course. If he gets through our obstacle course and then decides that our arguments are unclear or incorrect, we dismiss him as a crank, crackpot, or misfit.&lt;ref name=The_Ideal_Mathematician&gt;{{cite book|last1=David|first1=Phillip J.|last2=Hersh|first2=Reuben|title=New Directions in the Philosophy of Mathematics|date=1998|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|page=8|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042349/http://users-cs.au.dk/danvy/the-ideal-mathematician.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Corporate environments are similarly vulnerable to appeals to perceived authorities and experts leading to groupthink,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lookwin|first1=B.

''''Abu Bakr Muhammad at-Turtushi''' ({{Lang-ar|ابو بكر محمد بن الوليد الطرطوشي}}{{ltr}}) (1059 – 1126 CE; 451 [[Islamic calendar|AH]] – 520 AH ), better known as '''At-Turtushi''' was one of the most prominent [[al-Andalus|Andalusian]] political philosophers of the twelfth century. His book Kitāb Sirāj al-Mulūk (The Lamp of Kings) was one of the most important works of political theory to be produced in the medieval Islamic world. At-Turtushi was also an accomplished jurist in the [[Maliki]] school.

==Life==
ِAbu Bakr was born in Tortosa in 1059 in the northern region of [[Al-Andalus]] at the [[Ebro Delta]], at a time when the region had become increasingly fragmented and was divided into various [[taifa]] kingdoms. He first traveled to [[Zaragoza]], where he became a student under [[Abu al-Walid al-Baji]], a famous scholar and poet. While in Spain, he also familiarised himself with the philosophical and political treatises of the Andalusian polymath [[Ibn Hazm]].

He travelled for knowledge, seeking to educate himself from various scholars in different part of the Muslim world and went as far east as [[Baghdad]]. On his way he also stopped at [[Damascus]], [[Aleppo]], [[Cairo]], and [[Alexandria]]. He eventually settled in [[Fatimid]] Alexandria, where he taught at a [[madrassa]]. At-Turtushi strongly opposed the [[Ismaili]] ideology of the [[Fatimid]] dynasty in Egypt. He also issued a [[fatwa]] for Yusuf [[Ibn Tashfin]], the [[Almoravid]] ruler of Al-Andulus (Muslim Spain) that allowed him to invade Spain and depose of the divided [[Taifa]] kingdoms. His most famous work was ''[[Siraj al-Muluk]]'' (سراج الملوك) (The Lamp of Kings) an important treatise on political theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ballandalus.wordpress.com/2013/05/26/abu-bakr-al-turtushis-siraj-al-muluk-a-masterpiece-of-andalusi-political-philosophy/ Abu Bakr al-Turtushi’s “Siraj al-Muluk”: A Masterpiece of Andalusi Political Philosophy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203082944/http://ballandalus.wordpress.com/2013/05/26/abu-bakr-al-turtushis-siraj-al-muluk-a-masterpiece-of-andalusi-political-philosophy/ |date=December 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Baddha Padmasana'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hjnewsonline.com/international-yoga-day-baddha-padmasana-good-for-health/&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Bounded Lotus Pose''' is a variation of the cross legged sitting meditative [[asana]] called [[Lotus position|Padmasana]]. Baddha means bounded in Sanskrit and, as the name suggests, this asana is a bounded form of Padmasana. This asana improves flexibility of the joints of the lower extremities, helps the circulation of legs, helps to correct postural deformities, and improves concentration&lt;ref&gt;https://www.medindia.net/yoga-lifestyle/asana-baddhapadmasana.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Baddha padmasana.jpg|thumb|Baddha padmasana..Sadhak Anshit]]

==Tha Asana==
From the common [[sitting]] down on the floor (Indian Style, [[Cross-legged]]) position (asana), one foot is placed on top of the opposite thigh with its sole facing upward and heel close to the [[abdomen]]. The other foot is then lifted up slowly and placed on the opposite thigh in a symmetrical way. This is Padmasana.

One hand then reaches behind the back and catches hold of the same foot with the index and middle finger of the hand. This is then slowly done with the other hand. In the final position, the person doing the asana is constrained because of holding the feet with the hands coming from behind the back.

==Effects==
The range of shoulder movement is increased due to crossing of hands behind the back.

==Precautions==
It is generally not recommended for people with knee and ankle pain to attempt this asana.

'''Botton''' is a small village within the [[North York Moors National Park]] in [[North Yorkshire]], England which is mainly a [[Camphill Movement|Camphill Community]] for people with learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvt.org.uk/botton-village.html |title=Botton Village|publisher=The Camphill Village Trust|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The origins of Botton village ==

Botton was founded in 1955&lt;ref&gt;Jan Martin Bang, "Camphill Ecovillages", ''Proceedings of the Seventh International Communal Studies Conference: Communal living on the threshold of a new millennium: lessons and perspectives.'', International Communal Studies Association, ( 25–27 June 2001) pp. 249–257. [http://www.ic.org/icsa/docs/ICSA_eBook.pdf Conference proceedings.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070727014347/http://www.ic.org/icsa/docs/ICSA_eBook.pdf |date=27 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the initiative of the Camphill community in Scotland and initial direction of Peter Roth. It was the first organisation of its kind within the anthroposophical social therapeutic work specifically for people with disability after they reached adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;''Geschichte der anthroposophischen Heilpädagogik und Sozialtherapie - Entwicklung und Aufgabenfelder 1920 bis 1980'' Volker Frielingsdorf, Rüdiger Grimm, Brigitte Kaldenberg, Verlag am Goetheanum 2013, {{ISBN|9783723514788}}, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Builders of Camphill: Lives and Destinies of the Founders'' Edited by Friedwart Bock, Floris Books, 2004 {{ISBN|9780863154423}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is home to more than 230 people, around 100 of whom are adults with learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvt.org.uk/botton-village.html Camphill Village Trust Communities: Botton Village, North Yorkshire] Official website&lt;/ref&gt; Many people who live there, live in shared family-style homes together with co-workers, others are supported in shared accommodation with friends or live independently. There are five [[Biodynamic agriculture|biodynamic]] farms located around the village. The community works together on these farms, each person contributing according to his or her ability.[[File:Walled Garden, Botton Hall.jpg|thumb|left]]

In the village there are many different workshops where villagers make products which are sold to the public via a number of outlets. There are also three shops: a gift shop, for visitors, with items from both Botton and other Camphill villages; a village store, which is the village food shop and a "Coffee Bar" where the villagers and co-workers congregate in the evening to chat and play board games.

Botton village received the Deputy Prime Minister's Award for Sustainable Communities in 2005; the award cited the community's dedication to the ethos of sustainability and mutual respect, as well as their concrete achievements in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;"The Deputy Prime Minister's Award." ''Learning Disability Practice'' 9.2 (March 2006): 26(1)&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2005, the village featured in a [[Channel 4]] documentary entitled ''Botton, the strangest village in Britain''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/O/only_human/ ''The Strangest Village in Britain''] Channel4.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current disputes ==

Some members of the local and surrounding community have been in dispute with the charity that runs the village, the Camphill Village Trust (CVT), taking their case to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.actionforbotton.org/&lt;/ref&gt; However, following mediation at the beginning of July 2015, both sides are working to find a positive way forward for the community. They will return to review progress with the mediator early in 2016. The dispute centred on whether the historic model of volunteer co-workers receiving financial and other benefits from the charity, instead of a salary, in return for living and working in Botton, was acceptable to [[HM Revenue and Customs|Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC)]].

== Action for Botton ==

Action for Botton – the group campaigning with Botton co-workers for the retention of the voluntary co-worker model – believes that, in introducing paid employment for co-worker's services, the charity is acting against its own founding principles. They highlight many other Camphill Communities that continue to operate the co-worker model. Action for Botton also have letters stating that HMRC do not require volunteer co-workers to be employed&lt;ref&gt;http://www.actionforbotton.org/cms/tinymce/plugins/moxiemanager/data/files/Letter%20D%20Gauke%20re%20BIM22040%20redacted.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Financial Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke writes: "I would like to make it clear that that there has been no recent change in legislation, nor change in rules by HMRC, which affect the tax status of volunteer workers. It appears that changes being introduced by the CVT are as a result of independent advice received by the Trust, and not as a result of any direct or indirect action by HMRC."

However, a letter from HMRC to the CVT, dated 1 December 2014 and published on the Trust's Facebook page&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Camphill Village Trust|url = https://www.facebook.com/camphillvillagetrust?fref=ts|website = www.facebook.com|accessdate = 12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates otherwise, stating that "HMRC has now provided its Status Opinion in relation to the co-workers within the CVT which is that in our view those co-workers will be employees with effect from 6 April 2015. Consequently our view is that it is now incumbent on the Trustees and Directors of the CVT to take appropriate action mindful of their respectful fiduciary duties."

Action for Botton's main concern was that the move to paid employment would prevent co-workers from continuing to share their homes with learning disabled people in the way they had since Botton was established. During the mediation process, the Trust reaffirmed its commitment to shared living and co-working, within a mixed portfolio of living and care options available to the people it supports.

{{Tort law}}
In the [[United States]], the '''calculus of negligence''', also known as the '''Hand rule''', '''Hand formula''', or '''BPL formula''', is a term coined by Judge [[Learned Hand]] and describes a process for determining whether a legal duty of care has been breached (see [[negligence]]).  The original description of the calculus was in ''[[United States v. Carroll Towing Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[U.S. v. Carroll Towing]]'', 159 F.2d 169 ([[2d Cir.]] 1947).&lt;/ref&gt; in which an improperly secured [[barge]] had drifted away from a [[pier]] and caused damage to several other boats.

== Articulation of the rule ==
Hand stated:

{{quote|[T]he owner's duty, as in other similar situations, to provide against resulting injuries is a function of three variables: (1) The probability that she will break away; (2) the gravity of the resulting injury, if she does; (3) the burden of adequate precautions.}}

This relationship has been formalized by the [[law and economics]] school as such: an act is in breach of the [[duty of care]] if:

:&lt;math&gt;PL&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;

where ''B'' is the cost (burden) of taking precautions, and ''P'' is the probability of loss (''L'').  ''L'' is the gravity of loss.  The product of P x L must be a greater amount than B to create a duty of due care for the defendant.

== Rationale ==
The calculus of negligence is based on the [[Coase theorem]].  The tort system acts as if, before the injury or damage, a contract had been made between the parties under the assumption that a [[Rationality|rational]], cost-minimizing individual will not spend money on taking precautions if those precautions are more expensive than the costs of the harm that they prevent.  In other words, rather than spending money on safety, the individual will simply allow harm to occur and pay for the costs of that harm, because that will be more cost-efficient than taking precautions.  This represents cases where B is greater than PL.

If the harm could be avoided for ''less'' than the cost of the harm (B is less than PL), then the individual ''should'' take the precautions, rather than allowing the harm to occur.  If precautions were not taken, we find that a legal duty of care has been breached, and we impose liability on the individual to pay for the harm.

This approach, in theory, leads to an optimal allocation of resources; where harm can be cheaply avoided, the legal system requires precautions.  Where precautions are prohibitively expensive, it does not.  In marginal-cost terms, we require individuals to invest one unit of precautions up until the point that those precautions prevent exactly one unit of harm, and no less.

== Criticism ==
Critics point out that term "gravity of loss (L)" is vague, and could entail a wide variety of damages, from a scratched fender to several dead victims.&lt;ref name="Glannon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Glannon |first=Joseph W. |title=The Law of Torts |edition=3rd |year=2005 |publisher=[[Aspen Publishers]] |location=New York, NY |pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even then, on top of that, how exactly a juror should determine a value for such a loss is abstract in itself.  The speculative nature of the rule also seizes upon how a juror should determine the probability of loss (P).&lt;ref name="Glannon"/&gt;

Additionally, the rule fails to account for possible alternatives, whether it be the use of alternate methods to reach the same outcome, or abandoning the risky activity altogether.&lt;ref name="Glannon"/&gt;

Human teams estimating risk need to guard against judgment errors, cf. [[absolute probability judgement]].

== Use in practice ==
In the U.S., juries, with guidance from the court, decide what particular acts or omissions constitute negligence, so a reference to the standard of ordinary care removes the need to discuss this moot "rule". Juries are not told this "rule" but essentially use their common sense to decide what an ordinarily careful person would have done under the circumstances. The "calculus of negligence" has less practical value for the lay researcher seeking to understand how the courts actually determine negligence cases in the United States than the [[jury instructions]] used by the courts in the individual states.

Outside legal proceedings, this rule is the core premise of [[insurance]], [[risk management]], [[quality assurance]], [[information security]] and [[privacy]]{{clarify|date=July 2015}} practices.  It factors into [[due care]] and [[due diligence]] decisions in business risk.  Restrictions exist in the cases where the loss applies to human life or the probability of adverse finding in court cases. One famous case of abuse by industry in recent years related to the [[Ford Pinto]].

Quality assurance techniques extend the use of probability and loss to include uncertainty bounds in each quantity and possible interactions between uncertainty in probability and impact for two purposes.  First, to more accurately model customer acceptance and process reliability to produce wanted outcomes.  Second, to seek cost effective factors either up or down stream of the event that produce better results at sustainably reduced costs.  Example, simply providing a protective rail near a cliff also includes quality manufacture features of the rail as part of the solution.  Reasonable signs warning of the risk before persons reach the cliff may actually be more effective in reducing fatalities than the rail itself.

== Australia ==
In Australia, the calculus of negligence is a normative judgement with no formula or rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|63|2005|litigants=Mulligan v Coffs Harbour City Council |parallelcite=(2005) 223 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 486 |date=21 October 2005 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In NSW, the test is how a reasonable person (or other standard of care) would respond to the risk in the circumstances considering the 'probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken'&lt;ref name="CLA2002"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|cla2002161|Civil Liability Act 2002|5B}}(2)(a).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|5|1998|litigants=Romeo v Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory |parallelcite=(1998) 192 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 432 |date=2 February 1998 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and, 'the likely seriousness of the harm',&lt;ref name="CLA2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|court=UKHL |year=1950 |num=3 |litigants=[[Paris v Stepney Borough Council]] |parallelcite=[1951] {{abbr|AC|Appeal Cases}} 367 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 'the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm',&lt;ref name="CLA2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|9|2002|litigants=Woods v Multi-Sport Holdings Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(2002) [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 460 |date= |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 'social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm'.&lt;ref name="CLA2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|20|1991|litigants=E v Australian Red Cross Society |parallelcite=(1991) 27 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 310 |date= |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; State and Territory legislatures require that the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm be taken into account in determining whether or not a reasonable person would have taken precautions against that risk of harm.&lt;ref name="CLA2002"/&gt; For example, in ''Haris v Bulldogs Rugby League Club Limited'' &lt;ref name="Haris v Bulldogs"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|53|2006|litigants=Haris v Bulldogs Rugby League Club Limited |date=17 March 2006 |courtname= auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the court considered the social utility of holding football matches when determining whether a football club took sufficient precautions to protect spectators from the risk of being struck by fireworks set off as part of the entertainment during a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|53|2006|litigants=Haris v Bulldogs Rugby League Club Limited |date=17 March 2006 |courtname= auto}} per Santow JA at [60]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3473">'''Chimeric genes''' (literally, made of parts from different sources) form through the combination of portions of two or more [[Gene|coding sequences]] to produce new genes.  These [[mutation]]s are distinct from [[Fusion protein|fusion genes]] which merge whole gene sequences into a single reading frame and often retain their original functions.

==Formation==
Chimeric genes can form through several different means.  Many chimeric genes form through errors in [[DNA replication]] or [[DNA repair]] so that pieces of two different genes are inadvertently combined.&lt;ref name="Formation"&gt;Rogers, RL, Bedford, T and Hartl DL. "Formation and Longevity of Chimeric and Duplicat Genes in ''Drosphila''".  ''Genetics''. 181: 313-322.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chimeric genes can also form through [[Retrotransposon|retrotransposition]] where a retrotransposon accidentally copies the transcript of a gene and inserts it into the genome in a new location.  Depending on where the new [[retrogene]] appears, it can recruit new [[exon]]s to produce a chimeric gene.  Finally, [[ectopic recombination]], when there is an exchange between portions of the genome that are not actually related, can also produce chimeric genes.  This process occurs often in human genomes, and abnormal chimeras formed by this process are known to cause [[color blindness]].

==Evolutionary Importance of Fusion Proteins==
Chimeric genes are important players in the evolution of genetic novelty.  Much like [[gene duplication]]s, they provide a source of new genes, which can allow organisms to develop new [[phenotype]]s  and [[Adaptation|adapt]] to their environment.  Unlike duplicate genes, chimeric proteins are immediately distinct from their parental genes, and therefore are more likely to produce entirely new functions.  

Chimeric fusion proteins form often in genomes,&lt;ref name="Formation" /&gt; and many of these are likely to be dysfunctional and eliminated by natural selection.  However, in some cases, these new peptides can form fully functional gene products that are [[Natural selection|selectively favored]] and spread through populations quickly.

==Functions==
One of the most well known chimeric genes was identified in [[Drosophila]] and has been named [[Jingwei]].&lt;ref name="jingwei"&gt;Long, M., C. H. Langley 1993. "Natural selection and the origin of ''jingwei'', a chimeric processed functional gene in ''Drosophila''."  Science  260: 91-95.&lt;/ref&gt;  This gene is formed from a [[Retrotransposon|retrotransposed]] copy of [[Alcohol dehydrogenase]] that united with the yellow emperor gene to produce a new protein.&lt;ref name="jingwei" /&gt;  The new amino acid residues that it recruited from yellow emperor allow the new protein to act on long chain alcohols and diols, including growth hormones and pheremones.&lt;ref name ="Jgw func"&gt;Zhang J, Dean AM, Brunet F, Long M. 2004. "Evolving protein functional diversity in new genes of ''Drosophila''." ''Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A'' 101: 16246-50.&lt;/ref&gt; These changes affect fly development.  In this case, the combination of different [[protein domains]] resulted in a gene that was fully functional and favored by selection.

The functions of many chimeric genes are not yet known. In some cases these gene products are not beneficial and they may even cause diseases such as cancer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3415">'''David ben Yom Tov ibn Bilia''' was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Jewish]] [[philosopher]] who lived in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.

Ibn Bilia was the author of many works, the greater part of which, no longer in existence, are known only by quotations. Among them were: ''Me'or 'Enayim'', a commentary on the [[Pentateuch]], quoted by [[Joseph Caspi|Caspi]], [[Levi ben Gershon]], and chiefly by the author's countryman [[Samuel Zarza]], who often criticized Ibn Bilia's interpretations as being too mystical; and ''Yesodot ha-Maskil'', published, with a French translation by [[Solomon Klein|S. Klein]], in the collection ''Dibre Ḥakamim'', Metz, 1849.

In the ''Yesodot'' Ibn Bilia propounded thirteen articles of belief in addition to those of [[Maimonides]]. These are:
# The existence of incorporeal intellects;
# The creation of the world;
# The existence of a future life;
# Emanation of the soul from God;
# The soul's existence through its own substance and its self-consciousness;
# Its existence independent of the body it subsequently occupies;
# Retribution of the soul;
# Perdition of the souls of the wicked;
# Superiority of the Mosaic law over philosophy;
# The presence of an esoteric as well as an exoteric meaning in Holy Scripture;
# Inadmissibility of emendations of the Torah;
# The reward of the fulfilment of the divine precepts implied in the precepts themselves;
# The inadequacy of ceremonial laws alone for the realization of human perfection.

These, together with the [[Maimonides#The_13_principles_of_faith|thirteen articles of Maimonides]], make twenty-six, the numerical value of the [[Tetragrammaton]].

Ibn Bilia also wrote ''Ẓiyyurim'', an ethical work; ''Kilale ha-Higgayon'', a work on logic, of which only a fragment has been preserved (Neubauer, "Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS." No. 2168); ''Ma'amar bi-Segullot 'Or ha-Naḥash'', a treatise on the medicinal virtues of the skin of the serpent, translated from Johannes Paulinus' Latin translation "Salus Vitæ" (Munich, No. 228).

In the past some scholars, including the nineteenth century scholar [[Moritz Steinschneider]], have identified Ibn Bilia with the [[David ben Yom Tov]] who was the father of the Catalan astronomer [[Jacob ben David ben Yom Tov Poel]].  That David wrote works including the ''Kelal Qatan'' ("Concise Summary"), a treatise on the medical applications of astrology. However the two are now believed to have been separate individuals.

'''Dimitrie Gusti''' ({{IPA-ro|diˈmitri.e ˈɡusti}}; 13 February 1880 – 30 October 1955) was a [[Romania]]n [[Sociology|sociologist]], [[Ethnology|ethnologist]], historian, and [[Voluntarism (action)|voluntarist]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]]; a professor at the [[University of Iaşi]] and the [[University of Bucharest]], he served as Romania's Minister of Education in 1932–1933. Gusti was elected a [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]] in 1919, and was its president between 1944 and 1946. He was the main contributor to the creation of a new Romanian school of sociology.

He was a prominent member of the [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]], and later of the [[National Peasants' Party]] into which the former had merged.

==Biography==
Born in [[Iaşi]], he began studying Letters at the [[University of Iaşi]] before moving on to the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Universität unter den Linden]] and the [[University of Leipzig]], where he studied and completed a [[doctorate]] in Philosophy (1904). In 1905, he began the study of Sociology, Law, and [[Political economy]] at the Universität unter den Linden.

Gusti was appointed to the Department of Ancient History, [[Ethics]] and Sociology of the University of Iaşi in 1910, and was one of the main contributors to the creation of a new Romanian school of sociology. He moved to [[Bucharest]] in 1920, and began work as a professor at the [[University of Bucharest]], in the Department of Sociology, Ethics, Politics and [[Aesthetics]] of the latter's Faculty of Letters and Philosophy. His lectures became a center of interest inside the academic community, and he attracted students with diverse backgrounds and political convictions (the [[far right]] [[Mircea Vulcănescu]], the [[Communism|communist]] [[Miron Constantinescu]], the [[Austromarxism|Austromarxist]] [[Henri H. Stahl]], and the  left-wing artist [[Lena Constante]]).

Creator of the Bucharest School of Sociology and several Institutes, he also led, between 1925 and 1948, the intense research of Romanian villages and the publishing of its results as detailed [[Monography|monographs]] (a work in which he was notably assisted by [[Gheorghe Vlădescu-Răcoasa]] and Stahl). In 1936, together with Stahl and [[Victor Ion Popa]], Gusti created the [[Village Museum]] in Bucharest.

He left the National Peasants' Party after 1938, disagreeing with its decision to oppose the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime of [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]], and collaborated with the newly created [[National Renaissance Front]].&lt;ref&gt;Bozgan, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, he was threatened by the rise of the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]] (with the late 1940 establishment of the [[National Legionary State]]); following the [[Legionnaires' Rebellion and Bucharest Pogrom|Legionary Rebellion]] and the Guard's defeat, he sent a congratulatory telegram to ''[[Conducător]]'' [[Ion Antonescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Scurtu, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of [[World War II]], Gusti was approached by the new Communist government with offers of collaboration. He was invited to attend official ceremonies inside the [[Soviet Union]], and was a member of the [[Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Bozgan, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Bucharest, and was buried at [[Bellu Cemetery|Bellu]] cemetery.

==Theory==
Gusti defined his view on society as dependent on a set of principles:
*Society is composed of "[[social units]]", as groups of humans linked by a voluntary organizing activity and interconnected spiritually.
*The essence of life is "social will".
*"Social will" is expressed in [[economics]] and [[spirituality]], both of which are regulated by law and politics.
*"Social will" is conditioned by factors which are included in four fundamental and parallel categories: [[Cosmology|cosmical]], [[Life|biological]], [[Self (psychology)|psychological]], and historical.
*The changes engineered by the factors are known as "[[social process]]es".
*The premeses of development one can observe in present society, and thus can predict with some accuracy, are known as "social trends".

A creator of the sociological ''monographic method'' (as still used by his Bucharest School), Gusti favored and theoretised first-hand intensive observation of social units and phenomena, as well as [[interdisciplinarity]], with the research work being carried out through intensive collaboration within the field of [[social sciences]], but also with doctors, [[Agronomy|agronomists]], schoolteachers, etc.

'''Douglas Whiting Rae''' (born 1939) is a political scientist and Richard Ely Professor of Political Science and Management at [[Yale University]]. He is a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and served as Chief Administrative Officer of the [[City of New Haven]], [[Connecticut]] in 1990–1991. He has contributed to the [[BBC]], ''[[The New Republic]]'', and ''[[The New York Times]]''.

==Education==
He is a graduate of [[Indiana University]] and the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], where his Ph.D. adviser was [[Austin Ranney]].

==Works==
Perhaps his most seminal work, ''The Political Consequences of Electoral Laws'' (1967, 2nd ed. 1971), was the first systematic comparative analysis of electoral systems, applying the mathematical tools of social science to past elections in the Western industrialized world to determine the effects of electoral laws on election results, in particular on proportionality i.e. the correspondences between parties' vote shares and seat shares, and the number of parties in a given country. While the book has become dated by the explosion in electoral studies that occurred across the world more than a decade later, much of his terminology and guiding criteria e.g. his three basic dimensions of electoral systems (1) electoral formula (the mathematical method for translating votes into seats), (2) district magnitude (the number of members to be elected in a district), and (3) ballot structure (the way in which electoral choices are presented on the ballot), remain standard. It is generally regarded as the most important work on voting systems since [[Maurice Duverger]]'s "Political Parties" (1951, trans. 1954).

Rae's other highly influential book is ''Equalities'', published in 1981.  A noteworthy work on equality theory, "Equalities" compares and contrasts the ideas of a number of political theorists, including [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Robert Nozick]], [[John Rawls]], and [[Vilfredo Pareto]].

''City: Urbanism and its End'', published in 2003, is a history of New Haven, Connecticut and puts forth an account of late-19th and early-20th century [[urbanism]] in American cities. In ''City'', Rae presents detailed evidence of the flourishing civic life present in New Haven and elsewhere in this period. He maintains that urbanism was a product of "centering technologies"—such as rail and alternating current electricity—and many of the vital qualities associated with urbanism were contingent on these "accidents of urban creation." In the case of New Haven, he argues that the unparalleled spending on [[urban renewal]] by the administration of Mayor [[Richard C. Lee]] were necessarily unable to halt the technological shifts that caused urbanism's end. Rae contends that, given the futility of resurrecting the physical qualities of urbanism, that further spending on urbanist regeneration should focus on the positive social qualities of urbanism.

==Awards and recognition==
Rae has been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, was a fellow of Stanford’s [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]], a fellow of the [[Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study]], and has received numerous honors and prizes for his research. He has consulted widely and variously to the parliaments of Spain, Italy, &amp; the Netherlands Antilles, select corporate leaders, to numerous American cities and universities, and to the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=biography|url=http://som.yale.edu/douglas-w-rae|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dvādaśāha''' – ([[Sanskrit]]: द्वादशाह) literally means the twelve-day sacrifice.

The ''Soma sacrifice'' that takes twelve-days is called ''Dvādaśāha'' in which a ten-day sequence called ''dāśa-rātra'', is flanked by two intensive day and overnight sacrifices called ''atirātras'' as opening and closing days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Supreme Wisdom of the Upanishads|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=270|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2jnPlEqwe_UC&amp;pg=PA270&amp;dq=dvadasaha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8mVQVKOkA8_q8AWwaA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dvadasaha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Agnistoma'' serves as the paradigm for all ''Soma sacrifices'' up to those of twelve days duration, the ''Dvādaśāha'' soma sacrifice is paradigmatic for ''Soma sacrifices'' of twelve days and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reflections on Resemblance, Ritual and Religion|author=Brian K.

The twelve-days ''Soma sacrifices'' are called ''Ahinas'', and the longer ones are called ''Sattras''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Echoes of Ancient Indian Wisdom|author=Shantha N. nair|publisher=Pustak Mahal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OzFvE0IR7rkC&amp;pg=PT202&amp;lpg=PT202&amp;dq=dvadashaha&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X_stz-zXKW&amp;sig=xe_xNBVPd9aPd3LN14fkz7h0pGI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=E15QVLnCN4Wj8AXC4oKgAw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=dvadashaha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aitreya Brahmana describes the ''Dvādaśāha sacrifice'' in its Pancika IV.iv.23 to V.iv.25, beginning with the origin and the initial ritual of this sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sechzig Upanisad’s des Veda|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=9|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=dvadasaha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JWFQVO33F9PN8gXtyoL4Ag&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dvadasaha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first six ''Prishtha'' days of the ''Dvādaśāha '' sacrifice represent the mouth, the ''Chandomah'' days are the seventh to the ninth which represent what is in the mouth as tongue palate and teeth; but that by which one produces articulate sounds of speech or by which one distinguishes sweet and not sweet, is the tenth day which is the 'day of happiness'. Those desirous of prosperity perform this ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Aiterya Brahmanam of the Rig Veda Vol.2|page=356|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Vpw-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA356&amp;dq=dvadasaha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-WNQVOPUKJTn8AWXjIDQAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dvadasaha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental scheme of the sattras is that of a ''Dvādaśāha'' comprising a ''prayaniya-atiratra'' (one day), a ''prishthaya-shada-aha'' (six days), ''chandomas'' (three days), an ''avivakya'' (one day) and an ''udayaniya-atiratra'' (one day), which programme can be suitably extended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Antiquities of India|author=Lionel D.Barnett|publisher=Atlantic Publishers|page=173|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LnoREHdzxt8C&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=dvadasaha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8mVQVKOkA8_q8AWwaA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dvadasaha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Dvādaśāha'' sacrifice is both, ''Ahina'' and ''Sattra'' types of ''Soma sacrifice'', the former is ''Vayudha'', and the latter, ''Samudha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sayana’s Methodology in Interpreting the Rig Veda|author=Indrani Kar|publisher=Sanskrit Pustak  Bhandar|pages=213,214|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3rXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=dvadasaha&amp;dq=dvadasaha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JWFQVO33F9PN8gXtyoL4Ag&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Sattra'' type of session, there is no sacrifice, only Brahmins perform this ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of the Vedic Rituals|author=Chitrabhanu sen|publisher=Concept Publishing|page=115|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pW8E_bjmWD0C&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=dvadasaha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-WNQVOPUKJTn8AWXjIDQAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dvadasaha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, [[Badarayana]] states:-

:द्वादशाहवदुभयविधं बादरायणोऽतः |

:"Hence Bādarāyana considers the released souls to be of both kinds (i.e. with or without bodies and senses) just as it is the case with the Dvādaśāha (twelve-day) sacrifice." - ([[Brahma Sutras]] IV.iv.12)

[[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] explains that when a liberated soul wishes to have a body, he gets one; and when he desires to remain without it, he has none; for his will is true and desires are diverse like the ''Dvādaśāha'' which can be both a ''sattra'' and an ''ahina'', because of the injunction about the sacrifice itself and the specification of the sacrificer. And, [[Gambhirananda]] clarifies that ''Dvādaśāha'' becomes ''Ahina'' when there is injunction about it along with the specification of its performer; it is ''Sattra'' when it is resorted to by many performers. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya of Sankaracarya|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|page=904|url= https://www.amazon.in/Brahma-Sutra-Bhasya-Sankaracarya/dp/8175051051 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''eikasía''' ({{lang-grc|εἰκασία}}), meaning  imagination in Greek, was used by [[Plato]] to refer to a human way of dealing with appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swif.uniba.it/lei/foldop/foldoc.cgi?eikasia |title=eikasia |work=FOLDOC |accessdate=2006-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620035437/http://www.swif.uniba.it/lei/foldop/foldoc.cgi?eikasia |archivedate=2006-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the inability to perceive whether a [[perception]] is an [[image]] of something else. It therefore prevents us from perceiving that a [[dream]] or [[memory]] or a reflection in a [[mirror]] is not [[reality]] as such.

It is apart of [[Analogy of the divided line|Plato's Analogy of the Divided Line]].

== Education and professional career ==
Engebretsen obtained his master's degree in [[intellectual history]] from the University of Oslo in 2001 and his PhD from the same university in 2006. From 2007 to 2011 he worked as an associate professor in [[philosophy of science]] at the [[Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences]], where he still has an adjunct position. He has also worked as an assistant professor at the [[University of Lorraine]] in France (2001-2002) and as a senior adviser in [[Norad]]'s evaluation department (2006-2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.med.uio.no/helsam/english/people/aca/eivinden/|title=Eivind Engebretsen - Institute of Health and Society|last=|first=|date=|website=www.med.uio.no|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a board member of the International Society for Cultural History and the alternate Norwegian Member of the Helsinki Group on Gender in Research and Innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culthist.net/isch-committee/|title=ISCH Committee|website=www.culthist.net|language=en|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&amp;groupID=698 |title=Register of Commission expert groups and other similar entities|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2016-2017 Engebretsen was member of one of the expert groups for the interim evaluation of the European research programme, [[Horizon 2020]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&amp;groupID=3470|title=Register of Commission expert groups and other similar entities|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Cheveigné|first=Suzanne|last2= Bustelo|first2=Maria|last3=Engebretsen|first3=Eivind|last4=Sandström|first4=Ulf|last5=Knoll|first5=Bente|date=2017-10-13|title=Interim Evaluation: Gender equality as a crosscutting issue in Horizon 2020 Report|url=https://ec.europa.eu/research/swafs/pdf/pub_gender_equality/interim_evaluation_gender_long_final.pdf|publisher=European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Engebretsen's area of interest is knowledge trajectories and decision making in health care. His current research is concerned with the discourse of ‘[[knowledge translation]]’ and how this discourse might be expanded by drawing on theories of [[translation]] from [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]] and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.med.uio.no/helsam/english/research/groups/knowit/index.html|title=Knowledge in translation (KNOWIT) - Institute of Health and Society|website=www.med.uio.no|language=en|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work in this area has created international debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Greenhalgh, Trisha |date=2015-04-30 |title="Real v Rubbish EBM"|language=en |url=http://www.public-record.org/video/trish-greenhalgh-real-v-rubbish-ebm/qYvdhA697jI |access-date=2017-09-30 |publisher=CEBM Oxford }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evidentlycochrane.net/incomplete-misleading-reading-archie-cochrane |title=An incomplete and misleading reading |last=Chalmers, Ian |date=2016-10-21 |website= www.evidentlycochrane.net |publisher=Cochrane UK |access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Together with the philosopher and psychoanalyst [[Julia Kristeva]], Engebretsen has advocated a "new [[medical humanities]]" that not only considers the humanities as a corrective to biomedicine, but as a fundamental challenge to the whole distinction between medicine and the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kristeva|first=Julia|last2=Moro|first2=Marie Rose|last3=Ødemark|first3=John|last4=Engebretsen|first4=Eivind|date=2017-09-21|title=Cultural crossings of care: An appeal to the medical humanities|url=http://mh.bmj.com/content/early/2017/09/21/medhum-2017-011263|journal=Medical Humanities|language=en|pages=medhum–2017–011263|doi=10.1136/medhum-2017-011263|issn=1468-215X|pmid=28935631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engebretsen's research and publishing activities are characterized by border crossing and bridging between different scientific disciplines. He has published more than 100 scientific publications, including articles in renowned scientific journals such as [[the Lancet]], [[the BMJ]] and [[Social History]]. He has also written and edited several books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wo.cristin.no/as/WebObjects/cristin.woa/10/wa/fres?action=sok&amp;pnr=22703&amp;la=en&amp;sort=ar|title=Cristin|website=wo.cristin.no|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fazhengnian''' ({{zh|t=發正念|s=发正念|p=Fā Zhèng Niàn}}; literally "sending forth righteous thoughts") is a meditation exercise practiced in [[Falun Gong]] (or Falun Dafa). The practice of sending forth righteous thoughts was initiated by Falun Gong’s founder, Mr. [[Li Hongzhi]], on May 19, 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Teaching the Fa at the 2001 Canada Fa Conference {{!}} Falun Dafa - Minghui.org|url = http://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2001/5/22/10271.html|website = en.minghui.org|accessdate = 2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; a few years after the start of the [[persecution of Falun Gong]] by authorities of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Sending forth righteous thoughts is one of the three requirements for Falun Dafa practitioners during this period of time called "Fa-rectification," along with studying the Fa, and clarifying the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Falun Dafa - Home|url = http://en.falundafa.org/index.html|website = en.falundafa.org|access-date = 2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with Mr. Li Hongzhi's teachings, Minghui.org, with the aim of providing essential guidelines for sending forth righteous thoughts, advises that sending forth righteous thoughts is "very important, and every Fa-rectification period Dafa disciple must do well in this regard."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Minghui.org. [http://en.minghui.org/emh/articles/2005/3/12/58362.html Editorial: The Essentials to Sending Forth Righteous Thoughts and the Schedule for Sending Forth Righteous Thoughts at Set Times Around the World (Update 2)]&lt;/ref&gt; Additional instructions published on Minghui.org indicate that, "when sending forth righteous thoughts, your mind must be focused, pure, and stable."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ritual is performed by sitting in the full lotus (cross-legged) position. Two hand positions are employed: the first hand position involves holding the right palm erect in front of the chest, while the second consists of holding the hands in the lotus hand position.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Minghui.org. [http://en.minghui.org/emh/articles/2001/6/12/11429.html “The Two Hand Positions for Sending  Forth Righteous Thoughts”].&lt;/ref&gt; The hand positions are accompanied by the recitation of two formulas, which may be translated as: (1) “The Fa rectifies the Cosmos, the Evil is completely eliminated"; and (2) "The Fa rectifies Heaven and Earth, immediate retribution in this lifetime."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Minghui.org, "whether or not one's primary language is Chinese," practitioners "should use accurate Mandarin Chinese pronunciations as much as possible when reciting the verses."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Falun Dafa practitioners worldwide simultaneously send forth righteous thoughts four times daily.

== Characteristics ==
Freenode is centrally managed. Staffers or staff (as IRC operators are called) have the same access across all servers. A list of active staff can be viewed using the &lt;code&gt;/stats p&lt;/code&gt; command. Some operations that would normally only apply to one server (like k-lines) are propagated across the whole network. Servers are "donated" to the network, rather than "linked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://freenode.net/hosting_ircd.shtml |title= Hosting a Server |publisher= freenode.net |accessdate= 19 March 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130303194357/http://freenode.net/hosting_ircd.shtml |archivedate= 3 March 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network focuses on supporting peer-directed and open-source projects.&lt;ref name= "NetForGood"/&gt; Primary on-topic channels begin with a single #, and groups wanting to use such a channel must officially register with Freenode. "About" channels, which may not be about a peer-directed or open-source project, begin with two ##, and are available on a first-come, first-served basis without needing a group registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://freenode.net/policy.shtml#channelnaming |title= Policies: Channel Naming |publisher= freenode.net |accessdate= 19 March 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130321013005/http://freenode.net/policy.shtml#channelnaming |archivedate= 21 March 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Server software ===
Freenode currently runs Atheme IRC Services and IRCd-Seven, a set of Freenode-specific patches on the Charybdis IRCd (based on Ratbox). In 1999, Freenode ran an IRCd called Dancer (based on IRC-Hybrid) then switched to Hyperion in 2005. Hyperion was then replaced with IRCd-Seven&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://freenode.net/seven.shtml |title= ircd-seven |publisher= freenode.net |accessdate= 13 March 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130315171205/http://freenode.net/seven.shtml |archivedate= 15 March 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; on 30 January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.irc-junkie.org/2010-01-30/freenode-migration-to-ircd-seven-successfully-completed/ |title= freenode migration to ircd-seven successfully completed |date= 30 January 2010 |author= phrozen77 |accessdate= 19 March 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130204005542/http://www.irc-junkie.org/2010-01-30/freenode-migration-to-ircd-seven-successfully-completed/ |archivedate= 4 February 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://blog.freenode.net/2010/01/migration-to-new-ircd/ |title= Migration to ircd-seven |publisher= blog.freenode.net |date= 26 January 2010 |accessdate= 19 March 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130402185553/http://blog.freenode.net/2010/01/migration-to-new-ircd/ |archivedate= 2 April 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of freenode servers.svg|thumb|left|There are 23 Freenode servers around the world {{as of|2014|10|lc= on}}.]]
{{Anchor|ratbert}}

Freenode began as a 4-person [[Linux]] support channel called #LinPeople on [[EFnet]], another IRC network. By 1995 after moving to [[Undernet]] and then [[DALnet]] it moved from being just a channel to its own network, irc.linpeople.org. In early 1998 it changed to Open Projects Net (OPN) with about 200 users and under 20 channels.&lt;ref name= "Filson"&gt;{{cite book |title= Setting Up Lamp: Getting Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP Working Together |last= Filson |first= Eric |last2= Rosebrock |first2= Eric |year= 2004 |publisher= [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |page= 374 |isbn= 978-0782143379 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-vd6wozE8SEC&amp;pg=PA374&amp;lpg=PA374&amp;dq=freenode+1998&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=freenode%201998 |accessdate= 19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OPN soon grew to become the largest network for the [[free software community]], and 20th largest in the world.

On 24 June 2006, a user with the nickname "ratbert" gained administrative privileges of Freenode [[Network administrator|administrator]] Rob Levin (&lt;tt&gt;lilo&lt;/tt&gt;) and took control of the network. It is likely that approximately 25 user passwords were stolen as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=189470&amp;cid=15603568 |title= Freenode Network Hijacked, Passwords Compromised? |work= [[Slashdot]] |date= 26 June 2006 |accessdate= 19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This user proceeded to [[K-line (IRC)|K-line]] many Freenode staff members, and most Freenode servers subsequently went down for several hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1014005/freenode-irc-network-hacked |title= Freenode IRC Network hacked |last= Farrell |first= Nick |date= 26 June 2006 |work= The Inquirer |accessdate= 19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 30 January 2010, a new attack was discovered on Freenode that had never been seen before in the wild. [[Internet troll]] organization [[Gay Nigger Association of America]] created a piece of [[JavaScript]] that caused users of [[Firefox]], as well as [[SeaMonkey]] and [[Mozilla]]{{clarify|date= August 2012}} to silently connect to Freenode and [[IRC Flooding|flood]] it. This exploit used an ability of Firefox to [[HTTP POST|submit]] web forms to a [[port]] other than 80 (the default [[HTTP]] port). Whilst Firefox developers had blocked most ports some time ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www-archive.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/PortBanning.html |title= Mozilla Port Blocking |date= 15 August 2007 |publisher= [[Mozilla]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; port 6667, the port for IRC, was not blocked.&lt;ref name= "ffbug"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.softpedia.com/news/Firefox-Bug-Used-to-Harass-an-Entire-IRC-Network-133613.shtml |title= Firefox Bug Used to Harass Entire IRC Network |first= Lucian |last= Constantin |date= 30 January 2010 |work= [[Softpedia]] |quote= A group of self-declared Internet trolls, called the GNAA, has used an old but obscure attack method to wreak havoc on the Freenode IRC network.

On 2 February 2014 Freenode suffered a DDoS attack (confirmed by @freenodestaff on Twitter) which caused a partial outage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hn.meteor.com/posts/7168282-791bf |title= Freenode IRC is down |work= Hacker News |accessdate= 2 February 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140221001832/http://hn.meteor.com/posts/7168282-791bf |archive-date= 21 February 2014 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the attacks several servers remained nullrouted by their providers and for a short time period only a single server in rotation was accepting connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://blog.freenode.net/2014/02/turbulence/ |title= Turbulence |work= staffblog |accessdate= 22 February 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140227023432/https://blog.freenode.net/2014/02/turbulence/ |archive-date= 27 February 2014 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 2014 a DDoS attack occurred which caused the network to split for several hours followed by several botnet attacks in the #freenode channel and against Freenode's services. Freenode's infrastructure team noticed a vulnerability on one of their IRC servers. So far the team has only managed to identify indication of the server being compromised by an unknown third party. Freenode recommended that all users change their NickServ password for safety reasons, and has temporarily taken the compromised server offline until the vulnerability is fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.freenode.net/2014/09/server-issues-2/ |title= Server issues |work= staffblog |accessdate= 13 September 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140913160524/https://blog.freenode.net/2014/09/server-issues-2/ |archive-date= 13 September 2014 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freenode IRC users told to change passwords after securo-breach|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/09/15/freenode_irc_users_warned_breach/|website=[[The Register]]|accessdate=13 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613121806/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/09/15/freenode_irc_users_warned_breach/|archivedate=13 June 2015|date=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A deep technical analysis of the rootkit used in the attack was released on 14 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nccgroup.com/en/blog/2014/10/analysis-of-the-linux-backdoor-used-in-freenode-irc-network-compromise/ |title=Analysis of the Linux backdoor used in Freenode IRC network compromise |website=nccgroup.com |accessdate= 14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 August 2017 Freenode suffered from a "fairly extensive spambot attack ... containing child pornography images." In the midst of combating the attack, the operators accidentally set a [[IRCd#K-line|K-Line]] banning most users of the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://freenode.net/news/spamwave |title=Spambot Attack |work= staffblog |accessdate= 18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Peer-Directed Projects Center ==
The Peer-Directed Projects Center ('''PDPC''') is known as the organization which ran&lt;ref name="bye-pdpc"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://blog.freenode.net/2013/03/bye-bye-pdpc |title= Bye bye PDPC |date= 19 March 2013 |author= RichiH |accessdate= 19 March 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130322063238/http://blog.freenode.net/2013/03/bye-bye-pdpc/ |archive-date= 22 March 2013 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Freenode [[IRC]] network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://freenode.net/ |title= About the Network |publisher= Peer-Directed Projects Center (PDPC) |accessdate= 19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where many prominent open source projects host their official IRC channels. The PDPC was incorporated in [[England and Wales]].

PDPC was created to run the Freenode network and to establish a variety of programs relating to peer-directed project communities. According to its charter, the PDPC exists "to help peer-directed project communities flourish", mostly based around [[FOSS|free and open source software]] projects, and encouraging the use of free software through supporting its development. The GNU Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.gnu.org/press/2002-08-26-freenode.html |title= GNU Project Will Use Freenode as Its Official IRC Network |publisher= [[GNU Project]] |date= 26 August 2002 |accessdate= 19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the Freenode network for communication.

The PDPC was founded and initially directed by Rob Levin. In November 2006, the board went through a reshuffle and new members were installed. Seth Schoen left and Christel Dahlskjaer, senior Freenode staffer became the secretary and head of staff on Freenode in Schoen's place. Also joining the board was David Levin, Rob's brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://blog.freenode.net/2006/11/introducing-the-pdpc-board/ |title= Introducing the PDPC board |publisher= freenode.net |date= 11 November 2006 |accessdate= 19 March 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121130193558/http://blog.freenode.net/2006/11/introducing-the-pdpc-board/ |archive-date= 30 November 2012 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, the PDPC was dissolved. The decision to dissolve was made in part due to the donation levels and costs associated with maintaining its status as a charitable organization in the UK.&lt;ref name= "bye-pdpc"/&gt;

On 12 September 2006, Levin was struck by a car while riding a bicycle at night in [[Houston, Texas]], in a [[Hit and run (vehicular)|hit-and-run collision]]. After the collision, it was reported that Levin was hospitalized for several days. He died on 16 September.&lt;ref name= "freenode-death-news"/&gt;

=== OpenProjects ===
From 1994 onwards, Levin worked to encourage the use of IRC for [[Free Software]] and [[Open Source]] projects. Levin was one of the founders of the OpenProjects Network (OPN), which quickly grew to become the largest IRC network used by the free software community. The OpenProjects domains were later put up for sale, but did not sell.&lt;ref name="TheRegister_BuyAPiece"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/01/29/buy_a_piece_of_net/ |title= Buy a piece of Net nostalgia for $5,000 |first= Kieren |last= McCarthy |date= 29 January 2003 |work= [[The Register]] |accessdate= 19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 ''[[The Register]]'' (UK) reported that Levin [[embezzlement|mismanaged]] funds intended for the OPN, quoting him as writing that they went "to paying bills, to paying the rent, to buying food and necessities."&lt;ref name="TheRegister_BuyAPiece" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9812">'''Friedrich Kambartel''' (born 17 February 1935 in [[Münster]], [[Germany]]) is a philosopher.

==Biography==

Kambartel studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[philosophy]] at the University of Münster, where he received his PhD (in mathematics) and his “habilitation”, the postdoctoral lecture qualification (in philosophy). In 1966 he was appointed Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Constance]], where he took active part in the reformation of the university (“Little Harvard on Lake Constance”). Kambartel has close ties to the ''Erlangen School'' of constructivist philosophy of science. He taught at Frankfurt am Main from 1993 until his retirement in 2000.

Currently Kambartel is working together with his daughter on a conceptual novel.

Kambartel’s main research areas are the [[philosophy of language]], the philosophy of the natural sciences, and the [[philosophy of mind]]. However, he also did work in [[logic]], [[Action theory (philosophy)|action theory]], [[ethics]] and the philosophy of economics.

His most important works are the habilitation thesis “Erfahrung und Struktur” (“Experience and Structure”), published by Suhrkamp in 1968, as well as the two anthologies “Theorie und Begründung” (1978, “Theory and Justification”) and “Philosophie der humanen Welt” (1989, “Philosophy of the Human World”), also published by Suhrkamp.

Two major topics are present throughout Kambartel’s work — on the one hand the primacy of practical reason, and on the other the conception of reason as culture.

The first topic shapes his work in the philosophies of science, mind, and action. If practical reason were granted primacy over theoretical reason, if the latter were only possible on the basis of the former, then results obtained by [[neuroscience]], for example, could never show that man is determined after all and cannot really act freely.

The second topic does not emerge clearly until his later work, and then it also marks a distance to the constructive attempts of the Erlangen School. Reason was not to be understood exactly, e.g. to be defined as a principle or criterion. Reason was rather a culture you grow into, a social practice within which you cultivate your judgment. Conceptual judgments like [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]’s formula of man as an end in itself served as comments to parts of the “grammar” of this culture. Contrary to what Kant believed, morality was not supreme; it was only one standard of rationality among others; reason integrated this standard and weighed it up against other standards of rationality.

'''Genic capture''' is a hypothesis explaining the maintenance of [[genetic variance]] in traits under [[sexual selection]]. A classic problem in sexual selection is the fixation of [[alleles]] that are beneficial under strong selection, thereby eliminating the benefits of [[mate choice]]. Genic capture resolves this [[lek paradox|paradox]] by suggesting that [[Quantitative genetics|additive genetic variance]] of [[Sexual selection|sexually selected traits]] reflects the genetic variance in total condition.&lt;ref name="rowehoule"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowe|first=Locke|author2=Houle, David|title=The capture of genetic variance by condition dependent traits|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|year=1996|volume=263|pages=1415–1421|doi=10.1098/rspb.1996.0207|issue=1375}}&lt;/ref&gt; A deleterious [[mutation]] anywhere in the [[genome]] will adversely affect condition, and thereby adversely affect a condition-dependent sexually selected trait. Genic capture therefore resolves the [[lek paradox]] by proposing that recurrent deleterious mutation maintains additive genetic variance in fitness by incorporating the entire [[mutation load]] of an individual. Thus any condition-dependent trait "captures" the overall genetic variance in condition. Rowe and Houle argued that genic capture ensures that [[Handicap principle|good genes]] will become a central feature of the evolution of any sexually selected trait.

== Condition ==

The key quantity for genic capture is vaguely defined as "condition." The hypothesis only defines condition as a quantity that correlates tightly with overall [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], such that [[directional selection]] will always increase average condition over time. Condition should, in general, reflect overall energy acquisition, such that life-history variation reflects differential allocation to survival and sexual signalling. Genetic variation in condition should be very broadly affected by any changes in the genome. Close to [[genetic equilibrium|equilibrium]] any mutation should be [[Fisher's geometric model|deleterious]], thereby leading to non-zero overall mutation rate, maintaining variance in fitness.

== Rowe and Houle's Quantitative Genetic Model ==
Rowe and Houle's simple model defines a trait as the result of three heritable components, a condition-independent component &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, epistatic modification &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and condition, suggesting the following function for a trait:

&lt;math&gt;
T = a + bC
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the condition of an individual.  Loci contributing to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are loosely linked and independent of loci contributing to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.  Rowe and Houle then find the expected variance of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and ignored higher-order terms (i.e. products of variances):

&lt;math&gt;
G_T \approx G_a + \bar{b}^2 G_C + \bar{C}^2 G_b
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G_T&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[genetic variance]] in the signal and analogously for other traits.  Under [[directional selection]] on &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, the loci underlying &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; may lose all genetic variance.  However, there is no qualitative difference in directional selection on &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; between [[stabilizing selection]] (i.e. no sexual selection) and directional selection on &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, the second term &lt;math&gt;\bar{b}^2 G_C&lt;/math&gt; will remain positive (due to biased mutation) and dominate &lt;math&gt;G_T&lt;/math&gt; under sexual selection.

== Other Applications ==
Genic capture can also play a role in accelerating adaptation to new environments.&lt;ref name="lorch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorch|first=Patrick|title=Condition-dependent sexual selection can accelerate adaptation|journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research|year=2003|volume=5|pages=867–881|author2=Stephen Proulx |author3=Locke Rowe |author4=Troy Day }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparisons ==

Genic capture was proposed as a simpler alternative to another theory explaining the lek paradox&lt;ref name="moller"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pomiankowski|first=Andrew|author2=Moller, A.P.|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] | year=1995|volume=260|pages=21–29|doi=10.1098/rspb.1995.0054|title=A Resolution of the Lek Paradox|issue=1357}}&lt;/ref&gt; that proposed that sexual selection creates [[disruptive selection]], i.e. positive selection for genetic variance.  Genic capture does not require any particular fitness function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="79004">The mathematical concept of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] emerged in the 17th century in connection with the development of the [[calculus]]; for example, the slope &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{d}\!y/\operatorname{d}\!x&lt;/math&gt; of a graph at a point was regarded as a function of the ''x''-coordinate of the point. Functions were not explicitly considered in antiquity, but some precursors of the concept can perhaps be seen in the work of medieval philosophers and mathematicians such as [[Oresme]].

Mathematicians of the 18th century typically regarded a function as being defined by an [[analytic expression]]. In the 19th century, the demands of the rigorous development of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] by [[Weierstrass]] and others, the reformulation of [[geometry]] in terms of analysis, and the invention of [[set theory]] by [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]], eventually led to the much more general modern concept of a function as a single-valued mapping from one set to another.

==Functions before the 17th century==

Already in the 12th century, mathematician [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī|Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi]] analyzed the equation {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''d'' {{=}} ''b''⋅''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} in the form {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ⋅ (''b'' - ''x'') {{=}} ''d'',}} stating that the left hand side must at least equal the value of {{mvar|d}} for the equation to have a solution. He then determined the maximum value of this expression. It is arguable that the isolation of this expression is an early approach to the notion of a "function". A value less than {{mvar|d}} means no positive solution; a value equal to {{mvar|d}} corresponds to one solution, while a value greater than {{mvar|d}} corresponds to two solutions. Sharaf al-Din's analysis of this equation was a notable development in [[Islamic mathematics]], but his work was not pursued any further at that time, neither in the Muslim world nor in Europe.&lt;ref name="stages"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=Victor |last2=Barton |first2=Bill |title=Stages in the History of Algebra with Implications for Teaching |journal=Educational Studies in Mathematics |date=October 2007 |volume=66 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dieudonné {{sfn | Dieudonné | 1992 |p=55}} and Ponte,&lt;ref&gt;"The emergence of a notion of function as an individualized mathematical entity can be traced to the beginnings of infinitesimal calculus". ({{harvnb |Ponte |1992}})&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of a function emerged in the 17th century as a result of the development of [[analytic geometry]] and the [[infinitesimal calculus]]. Nevertheless, Medvedev suggests that the implicit concept of a function is one with an ancient lineage.&lt;ref&gt;"...although we do not find in [the mathematicians of Ancient Greece] the idea of functional dependence distinguished in explicit form as a comparatively independent object of study, nevertheless one cannot help noticing the large stock of functional correspondences they studied." ({{harvnb |Medvedev|1991|pages=29–30}})&lt;/ref&gt; Ponte also sees more explicit approaches to the concept in the [[Middle Ages]]:

:Historically, some mathematicians can be regarded as having foreseen and come close to a modern formulation of the concept of function. Among them is [[Nicole Oresme|Oresme]] (1323–1382) . . . In his theory, some general ideas about independent and dependent variable quantities seem to be present.{{sfn |Ponte |1992}}

The development of analytical geometry around 1640 allowed mathematicians to go between geometric problems about curves and algebraic relations between "variable coordinates ''x'' and ''y''."{{sfn|Gardiner|1982|p=255}} Calculus was developed using the notion of variables, with their associated geometric meaning, which persisted well into the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Gardiner|1982|p=256}} However, the terminology of "function" came to be used in interactions between Leibniz and Bernoulli towards the end of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Kleiner 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kleiner |first=Israel |chapter=Evolution of the Function Concept: A Brief Survey |editor1=Marlow Anderson |editor2=Victor Katz |editor3=Robin Wilson |title=Who Gave You the Epsilon?: And Other Tales of Mathematical History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwFMjsym9JwC&amp;pg=PA15 |year=2009 |publisher=MAA |isbn=978-0-88385-569-0 |pages=14–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The notion of "function" in analysis==

The term "'''function'''" was literally introduced by [[Gottfried Leibniz]], in a 1673 letter, to describe a quantity related to points of a [[curve]], such as a [[coordinate]] or curve's [[slope]].&lt;ref&gt;Eves dates Leibniz's first use to the year 1694 and also similarly relates the usage to "as a term to denote any quantity connected with a curve, such as the coordinates of a point on the curve, the slope of the curve, and so on" ({{harvnb |Eves |1990 |p=234}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Johann Bernoulli]] started calling expressions made of a single variable "functions."
In 1698, he agreed with Leibniz that any quantity formed "in an algebraic and transcendental manner" may be called a function of ''x''.&lt;ref name="Bourbaki2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=N. Bourbaki|title=Elements of Mathematics Functions of a Real Variable: Elementary Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dtYLvM02cRYC&amp;pg=PA154|date=18 September 2003|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-65340-0|pages=154–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1718, he came to regard as a function "any expression made up of a variable and some constants."{{sfn |Eves |1990 |p=234}} [[Alexis Claude Clairaut]] (in approximately 1734) and [[Leonhard Euler]] introduced the familiar notation &lt;math&gt;{f(x)}&lt;/math&gt; for the value of a function.{{sfn |Eves |1990 |p=235}}

The functions considered in those times are called today [[derivative|differentiable functions]]. For this type of function, one can talk about [[limit of a function|limit]]s and derivatives; both are measurements of the output or the change in the output as it depends on the input or the change in the input.  Such functions are the basis of [[calculus]].

===Euler===
In the first volume of his fundamental text ''Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum'', published in 1748, Euler gave essentially the same definition of a function as his teacher Bernoulli, as an [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]] or [[formula]] involving variables and constants e.g., &lt;math&gt;{x^2+3x+2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves |1990 |p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euler's own definition reads:

:A function of a variable quantity is an analytic expression composed in any way whatsoever of the variable quantity and numbers or constant quantities.{{sfn |Euler |1988 |p=3}}

Euler also allowed multi-valued functions whose values are determined by an implicit equation.

In 1755, however, in his ''Institutiones Calculi Differentialis,'' Euler gave a more general concept of a function:

:When certain quantities depend on others in such a way that they undergo a change when the latter change, then the first are called ''functions'' of the second. This name has an extremely broad character; it encompasses all the ways in which one quantity can be determined in terms of others.{{sfn|Euler|2000|p=VI}}

Medvedev{{sfn|Medvedev | 1991|p=47}} considers that "In essence this is the definition that became known as Dirichlet's definition." Edwards{{sfn|Edwards|2007|p=47}} also credits Euler with a general concept of a function and says further that

:The relations among these quantities are not thought of as being given by formulas, but on the other hand they are surely not thought of as being the sort of general set-theoretic, anything-goes subsets of product spaces that modern mathematicians mean when they use the word "function".

===Fourier===
In his ''Théorie Analytique de la Chaleur,''{{sfn | Fourier | 1822 }} [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]] claimed that an arbitrary function could be represented by a Fourier series.&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary mathematicians, with much broader and more precise conceptions of functions, integration, and different notions of convergence than was possible in Fourier's time (including examples of functions that were regarded as pathological and referred to as "monsters" until as late as the turn of the 20th century), would not agree with Fourier that a completely arbitrary function can be expanded in Fourier series, even if its Fourier coefficients are well-defined. For example, [[Kolmogorov]] (1922) constructed a Lebesgue integrable function whose Fourier series diverges pointwise almost everywhere. Nevertheless, a very wide class of functions can be expanded in Fourier series, especially if one allows weaker forms of convergence, such as convergence in the sense of distributions. Thus, Fourier's claim was a reasonable one in the context of his time.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourier had a general conception of a function, which included functions that were neither continuous nor defined by an analytical expression.&lt;ref&gt;For example: "A general function ''f(x)'' is a sequence of values or ordinates, each of which is arbitrary...It is by no means assumed that these ordinates are subject to any general law; they may follow one another in a completely arbitrary manner, and each of them is defined as if it were a unique quantity." ({{harvnb|Fourier|1822|p=552}})&lt;/ref&gt; Related questions on the nature and representation of functions, arising from the solution of the [[wave equation]] for a vibrating string, had already been the subject of dispute between [[d'Alembert]] and Euler, and they had a significant impact in generalizing the notion of a function. [[Nikolai Luzin|Luzin]] observes that:

:The modern understanding of function and its definition, which seems correct to us, could arise only after Fourier's discovery. His discovery showed clearly that most of the misunderstandings that arose in the debate about the vibrating string were the result of confusing two seemingly identical but actually vastly different concepts, namely that of function and that of its analytic representation. Indeed, prior to Fourier's discovery no distinction was drawn between the concepts of "function" and of "analytic representation," and it was this discovery that brought about their disconnection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Luzin|
1998 | p=263}}. Translation by Abe Shenitzer of an article by Luzin that appeared (in the 1930s) in the first edition of The Great Soviet Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cauchy===
During the 19th century, mathematicians started to formalize all the different branches of mathematics. One of the first to do so was [[Cauchy]]; his somewhat imprecise results were later made completely rigorous by [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]], who advocated building calculus on [[arithmetic]] rather than on [[geometry]], which favoured Euler's definition over Leibniz's (see [[arithmetization of analysis]]). According to Smithies, Cauchy thought of functions as being defined by equations involving real or complex numbers, and tacitly assumed they were continuous:

:Cauchy makes some general remarks about functions in Chapter I, Section 1 of his ''Analyse algébrique'' (1821). From what he says there, it is clear that he normally regards a function as being defined by an analytic expression (if it is explicit) or by an equation or a system of equations (if it is implicit); where he differs from his predecessors is that he is prepared to consider the possibility that a function may be defined only for a restricted range of the independent variable.{{sfn|Smithies |1997|p=187}}

===Lobachevsky and Dirichlet===
[[Nikolai Lobachevsky]]&lt;ref&gt;"On the vanishing of trigonometric series," 1834 ({{harvnb | Lobachevsky |1951 | pages=31–80}}).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]]&lt;ref&gt;Über die Darstellung ganz willkürlicher Funktionen durch Sinus- und Cosinusreihen," 1837 ({{harvnb|Dirichlet|1889|pages=135–160}}).&lt;/ref&gt; are traditionally credited with independently giving the modern "formal" definition of a function as a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] in which every first element has a unique second element.

Lobachevsky (1834) writes that

:The general concept of a function requires that a function of ''x'' be defined as a number given for each ''x'' and varying gradually with ''x''. The value of the function can be given either by an analytic expression, or by a condition that provides a means of examining all numbers and choosing one of them; or finally the dependence may exist but remain unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lobachevsky |1951|p=43}} as quoted in {{harvnb|Medvedev|1991|p=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

while Dirichlet (1837) writes

:If now a unique finite ''y'' corresponding to each ''x'', and moreover in such a way that when ''x'' ranges continuously over the interval from ''a'' to ''b'', &lt;math&gt;{y=f(x)}&lt;/math&gt; also varies continuously, then ''y'' is called a ''continuous'' function of ''x'' for this interval. It is not at all necessary here that ''y'' be given in terms of ''x'' by one and the same law throughout the entire interval, and it is not necessary that it be regarded as a dependence expressed using mathematical operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dirichlet|1889 |p=135}} as quoted in {{harvnb|Medvedev|1991|pages=60–61}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eves asserts that "the student of mathematics usually meets the Dirichlet definition of function in his introductory course in calculus,.&lt;ref&gt;Eves asserts that Dirichlet "arrived at the following formulation: "[The notion of] a ''variable'' is a symbol that represents any one of a set of numbers; if two variables ''x'' and ''y'' are so related that whenever a value is assigned to ''x'' there is automatically assigned, by some rule or correspondence, a value to ''y'', then we say ''y'' is a (single-valued) ''function'' of x. The variable ''x'' . . . is called the ''independent variable'' and the variable ''y'' is called the dependent variable. The permissible values that ''x'' may assume constitute the ''domain of definition'' of the function, and the values taken on by y constitute the ''range of values'' of the function . . . it stresses the basic idea of a relationship between two sets of numbers" {{harvnb |Eves |1990 |p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dirichlet's claim to this formalization has been disputed by [[Imre Lakatos]]:

:There is no such definition in Dirichlet's works at all.  But there is ample evidence that he had no idea of this concept.  In his [1837] paper for instance, when he discusses piecewise continuous functions, he says that at points of discontinuity the function ''has two values'': ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Imre Lakatos |first=Imre |last=Lakatos |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Worrall |editor2-first=Elie |editor2-last=Zahar |year=1976 |title= Proofs and Refutations |location= Cambridge |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 0-521-29038-4 |page=151 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1n6SFdXCOBQC}} Published posthumously.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Gardiner says
"...it seems to me that Lakatos goes too far, for example, when he asserts that 'there is ample evidence that [Dirichlet] had no idea of [the modern function] concept'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gardiner |first=A.|year=1982|ref=harv |title=Understanding infinity,the mathematics of infinite processes |page=275 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |isbn=0-486-42538-X |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=NiDCYJ8vrGQC&amp;pg=PA275&amp;lpg=PA275&amp;dq=dirichlet+lakatos+arbitrary+have+not+checked&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Tn6NPwu42&amp;sig=woChOYaXCoomirwrqW1VVWyRxE8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sTp4T9zyAoHL0QWwsoW4DQ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, as noted above, Dirichlet's paper does appear to include a definition along the lines of what is usually ascribed to him, even though (like Lobachevsky) he states it only for continuous functions of a real variable.

Similarly, Lavine observes that:

:It is a matter of some dispute how much credit Dirichlet deserves for the modern definition of a function, in part because he restricted his definition to continuous functions....I believe Dirichlet defined the notion of ''continuous'' function to make it clear that no rule or law is required even in the case of continuous functions, not just in general. This would have deserved special emphasis because of Euler's ''definition'' of a continuous function as one given by single expression-or law. But I also doubt there is sufficient evidence to settle the dispute.{{sfn | Lavine | 1994 |p=34}}

Because Lobachevsky and Dirichlet have been credited as among the first to introduce the notion of an arbitrary correspondence, this notion is sometimes referred to as the Dirichlet or Lobachevsky-Dirichlet definition of a function.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb | Medvedev | 1991 |pages=55–70}} for further discussion.&lt;/ref&gt; A general version of this definition was later used by [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] (1939), and some in the education community refer to it as the "Dirichlet–Bourbaki" definition of a function.

===Dedekind===
[[Jean Dieudonné|Dieudonné]], who was one of the founding members of the Bourbaki group, credits a precise and general modern definition of a function to [[Dedekind]] in his work
''Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen'',&lt;ref&gt;"By a mapping φ of a set ''S'' we understand a law that assigns to each element ''s'' of ''S'' a uniquely determined object called the ''image'' of ''s'', denoted as φ(''s''). {{harvnb | Dedekind  |1995|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which appeared in 1888 but had already been drafted in 1878. Dieudonné observes that instead of confining himself, as in previous conceptions, to real (or complex) functions, Dedekind defines a function as a single-valued mapping between any two sets:

:What was new and what was to be essential for the whole of mathematics was the entirely general conception of a ''function''.{{sfn | Dieudonné | 1992 | p=135}}

===Hardy===
{{harvnb|Hardy|1908|pp=26–28}} defined a function as a relation between two variables ''x'' and ''y'' such that "to some values of ''x'' at any rate correspond values of ''y''."  He neither required the function to be defined for all values of ''x'' nor to associate each value of ''x'' to a single value of&amp;nbsp;''y''. This broad definition of a function encompasses more relations than are ordinarily considered functions in contemporary mathematics.  For example, Hardy's definition includes [[multivalued function]]s and what in [[computability theory]] are called [[partial functions]].

==The logician's "function" prior to 1850==
[[Logician]]s of this time were primarily involved with analyzing [[syllogism]]s (the 2000-year-old Aristotelian forms and otherwise), or as [[Augustus De Morgan]] (1847) stated it: "the examination of that part of reasoning which depends upon the manner in which inferences are formed,
and the investigation of general maxims and rules for constructing arguments".{{sfn |De Morgan |1847 |p=1}} At this time the notion of (logical) "function" is not explicit, but at least in the work of De Morgan and [[George Boole]] it is implied: we see abstraction of the argument forms, the introduction of variables, the introduction of a symbolic algebra with respect to these variables, and some of the notions of set theory.

De Morgan's 1847 "FORMAL LOGIC OR, The Calculus of Inference, Necessary and Probable" observes that "[a] [[logical truth]] depends upon the ''structure of the statement'', and not upon the particular matters spoken of"; he wastes no time (preface page i) abstracting: "In the form of the proposition, the copula is made as abstract as the terms". He immediately (p.&amp;nbsp;1) casts what he calls "the proposition" (present-day propositional ''function'' or ''relation'') into a form such as "X is Y", where the symbols X, "is", and Y represent, respectively, the ''subject'', ''copula'', and ''predicate.'' While the word "function" does not appear, the notion of "abstraction" is there, "variables" are there, the notion of inclusion in his symbolism "all of the Δ is in the О" (p.&amp;nbsp;9) is there, and lastly a new symbolism for logical analysis of the notion of "relation" (he uses the word with respect to this example " X)Y " (p.&amp;nbsp;75) ) is there:
:" A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; X)Y  To take an X it is necessary to take a Y" [or To be an X it is necessary to be a Y]
:" A&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Y)X  To take a Y it is sufficient to take a X" [or To be a Y it is sufficient to be an X], etc.

In his 1848 ''The Nature of Logic'' Boole asserts that "logic  . . . is in a more especial sense the science of reasoning by signs", and he briefly discusses the notions of "belonging to" and "class": "An individual may possess a great variety of attributes and thus belonging to a great variety of different classes" .&lt;ref&gt;Boole 1848 in {{harvnb |Grattan-Guinness |Bornet |1997 |pp=1, 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like De Morgan he uses the notion of "variable" drawn from analysis; he gives an example of "represent[ing] the class oxen by ''x'' and that of horses by ''y'' and the conjunction ''and'' by the sign + . . . we might represent the aggregate class oxen and horses by ''x + y''".&lt;ref&gt;Boole 1848 in {{harvnb |Grattan-Guinness |Bornet |1997 |p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of "the Differential Calculus" Boole defined (circa 1849) the notion of a function as follows:
:"That quantity whose variation is uniform . . . is called the independent variable. That quantity whose variation is referred to the variation of the former is said to be a ''function'' of it. The Differential calculus enables us in every case to pass from the function to the limit. This it does by a certain Operation. But in the very Idea of an Operation is . . . the idea of an inverse operation. To effect that inverse operation in the present instance is the business of the Int[egral] Calculus."&lt;ref&gt;Boole circa 1849 ''Elementary Treatise on Logic not mathematical including philosophy of mathematical reasoning'' in {{harvnb |Grattan-Guinness |Bornet |1997 |p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The logicians' "function" 1850–1950==
Eves observes "that logicians have endeavored to push down further the starting level of the definitional development of mathematics and to derive the theory of sets, or classes, from a foundation in the logic of propositions and propositional functions".{{sfn |Eves |1990 |p=222}} But by the late 19th century the logicians' research into the foundations of mathematics was undergoing a major split. The direction of the first group, the [[Logicist]]s, can probably be summed up best by {{harvard citations |nb |first=Bertrand |last=Russell |year=1903 |p=9}} – "to fulfil two objects, first, to show that all mathematics follows from symbolic logic, and secondly to discover, as far as possible, what are the principles of symbolic logic itself."

The second group of logicians, the set-theorists, emerged with [[Georg Cantor]]'s "set theory" (1870–1890) but were driven forward partly as a result of Russell's discovery of a paradox that could be derived from Frege's conception of "function", but also as a reaction against Russell's proposed solution.&lt;ref&gt;Some of this criticism is intense: see the introduction by [[Willard Quine]] preceding {{harvnb |Russell |1908a}} ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types'' in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=151}}. See also in {{harvnb |von Neumann |1925}} the introduction to his ''Axiomatization of Set Theory'' in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zermelo's set-theoretic response was his 1908 ''Investigations in the foundations of set theory I'' – the first axiomatic set theory; here too the notion of "propositional function" plays a role.

===George Boole's ''The Laws of Thought'' 1854; John Venn's ''Symbolic Logic'' 1881===
In his ''An Investigation into the laws of thought'' Boole now defined a function in terms of a symbol ''x'' as follows:
:"8. Definition. – Any algebraic expression involving symbol ''x'' is termed a function of x, and may be represented by the abbreviated form f(x)"{{sfn |Boole |1854 |p=86}}
Boole then used ''algebraic'' expressions to define both algebraic and ''logical'' notions, e.g., 1&amp;minus;''x'' is logical NOT(''x''), ''xy'' is the logical AND(''x'',''y''), ''x + y'' is the logical OR(''x'', ''y''), ''x''(''x''+''y'') is ''xx''+''xy'', and "the special law" ''xx'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''.&lt;ref&gt;cf {{harvnb |Boole |1854 |pp=31–34}}. Boole discusses this "special law" with its two algebraic roots ''x'' = 0 or 1, on page 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1881 ''Symbolic Logic'' Venn was using the words "logical function" and the contemporary symbolism ( x = f(y), y = f&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(x), cf page xxi) plus the circle-diagrams historically associated with Venn to describe "class relations",&lt;ref&gt;Although he gives others credit, cf {{harvnb |Venn |1881 |p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the notions "'quantifying' our predicate", "propositions in respect of their extension", "the relation of inclusion and exclusion of two classes to one another", and "propositional function" (all on p.&amp;nbsp;10), the bar over a variable to indicate not-x (page 43), etc. Indeed he equated unequivocally the notion of "logical function" with "class" [modern "set"]: "... on the view adopted in this book, f(x) never stands for anything but a logical class. It may be a compound class aggregated of many simple classes; it may be a class indicated by certain inverse logical operations, it may be composed of two groups of classes equal to one another, or what is the same thing, their difference declared equal to zero, that is, a logical equation. But however composed or derived, f(x) with us will never be anything else than a general expression for such logical classes of things as may fairly find a place in ordinary Logic".{{sfn |Venn |1881 |pp=86–87}}

===Frege's ''Begriffsschrift'' 1879===
[[Gottlob Frege]]'s [[Begriffsschrift]] (1879) preceded [[Giuseppe Peano]] (1889), but Peano had no knowledge of {{harvnb |Frege |1879}} until after he had published his 1889.&lt;ref&gt;cf van Heijenoort's introduction to {{harvnb |Peano |1889}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967}}. For most of his logical symbolism and notions of propositions Peano credits "many writers, especially Boole". In footnote 1 he credits Boole 1847, 1848, 1854, Schröder 1877, Peirce 1880, Jevons 1883, MacColl 1877, 1878, 1878a, 1880; cf {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=86}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Both writers strongly influenced {{harvtxt |Russell |1903}}. Russell in turn influenced much of 20th-century mathematics and logic through his ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (1913) jointly authored with [[Alfred North Whitehead]].

At the outset Frege abandons the traditional "concepts ''subject'' and ''predicate''", replacing them with ''argument'' and ''function'' respectively, which he believes "will stand the test of time. It is easy to see how regarding a content as a function of an argument leads to the formation of concepts. Furthermore, the demonstration of the connection between the meanings of the words ''if, and, not, or, there is, some, all,'' and so forth, deserves attention".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Frege |1879}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frege begins his discussion of "function" with an example: Begin with the expression&lt;ref&gt;Frege's exact words are "expressed in our formula language" and "expression", cf {{harvnb |Frege |1879}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |pp=21–22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Hydrogen is lighter than carbon dioxide". Now remove the sign for hydrogen (i.e., the word "hydrogen") and replace it with the sign for oxygen (i.e., the word "oxygen"); this makes a second statement. Do this again (using either statement) and substitute the sign for nitrogen (i.e., the word "nitrogen") and note that "This changes the meaning in such a way that "oxygen" or "nitrogen" enters into the relations in which "hydrogen" stood before".&lt;ref&gt;This example is from {{harvnb |Frege |1879}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three statements:
* "Hydrogen is lighter than carbon dioxide."
* "Oxygen is lighter than carbon dioxide."
* "Nitrogen is lighter than carbon dioxide."
Now observe in all three a "stable component, representing the totality of [the] relations";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Frege |1879}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; call this '''the function''', i.e.,
: "... is lighter than carbon dioxide", is the function.
Frege calls the '''argument''' of the function "[t]he sign [e.g., hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen], regarded as replaceable by others that [[denotation|denotes]] the object standing in these relations".&lt;ref&gt;Frege cautions that the function will have "argument places" where the argument should be placed as distinct from other places where the same sign might appear. But he does not go deeper into how to signify these positions and {{harvnb |Russell |1903}} observes this.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that we could have derived the function as "Hydrogen is lighter than . . .." as well, with an argument position on the ''right''; the exact observation is made by Peano (see more below). Finally, Frege allows for the case of two (or more arguments). For example, remove "carbon dioxide" to yield the invariant part (the function) as:
* "... is lighter than ... "
The one-argument function Frege generalizes into the form Φ(A) where A is the argument and Φ( ) represents the function, whereas the two-argument function he symbolizes as Ψ(A, B) with A and B the arguments and Ψ( , ) the function and cautions that "in general Ψ(A, B) differs from Ψ(B, A)". Using his unique symbolism he translates for the reader the following symbolism:
:"We can read |--- Φ(A) as "A has the property Φ. |--- Ψ(A, B) can be translated by "B stands in the relation Ψ to A" or "B is a result of an application of the procedure Ψ to the object A".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Frege |1879}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |pp=21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peano's ''The Principles of Arithmetic'' 1889===
Peano defined the notion of "function" in a manner somewhat similar to Frege, but without the precision.&lt;ref&gt;"...Peano intends to cover much more ground than Frege does in his ''Begriffsschrift'' and his subsequent works, but he does not till that ground to any depth comparable to what Frege does in his self-allotted field", {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; First Peano defines the sign "K means ''class'', or aggregate of objects",{{sfn |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=89}} the objects of which satisfy three simple equality-conditions,{{sfn |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=91}} ''a = a'', (''a = b'') = (''b = a''), IF ((''a = b'') AND (''b = c'')) THEN (''a = c''). He then introduces φ, "a sign or an aggregate of signs such that if ''x'' is an object of the class ''s'', the expression φx denotes a new object". Peano adds two conditions on these new objects: First, that the three equality-conditions hold for the objects φx; secondly, that "if ''x'' and ''y'' are objects of class ''s'' and if ''x'' = ''y'', we assume it is possible to deduce ''φx = φy''".&lt;ref&gt;All symbols used here are from {{harvnb |Peano |1889}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=91}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Given all these conditions are met, φ is a "function presign". Likewise he identifies a "function postsign". For example   if ''φ'' is the function presign ''a''+, then ''φx'' yields ''a''+''x'', or if ''φ'' is the function postsign +''a'' then ''xφ'' yields  ''x''+''a''.{{sfn |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=91}}

===Bertrand Russell's ''The Principles of Mathematics'' 1903===
While the influence of Cantor and Peano was paramount,&lt;ref&gt;"In Mathematics, my chief obligations, as is indeed evident, are to Georg Cantor and Professor Peano. If I had become acquainted sooner with the work of Professor Frege, I should have owed a great deal to him, but as it is I arrived independently at many results which he had already established", {{harvnb |Russell |1903 |p=viii}}. He also highlights Boole's 1854 ''Laws of Thought'' and [[Ernst Schröder]]'s three volumes of "non-Peanesque methods" 1890, 1891, and 1895 cf {{harvnb |Russell |1903 |p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Appendix A "The Logical and Arithmetical Doctrines of Frege" of ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'', Russell arrives at a discussion of Frege's notion of ''function'', "...a point in which Frege's work is very important, and requires careful examination".{{sfn |Russell |1903 |p=505}} In response to his 1902 exchange of letters with Frege about the contradiction he discovered in Frege's ''Begriffsschrift'' Russell tacked this section on at the last moment.

For Russell the bedeviling notion is that of "variable": "6. Mathematical propositions are not only characterized by the fact that they assert implications, but also by the fact that they contain ''variables''. The notion of the variable is one of the most difficult with which logic has to deal. For the present, I openly wish to make it plain that there are variables in all mathematical propositions, even where at first sight they might seem to be absent. . . . We shall find always, in all mathematical propositions, that the words ''any'' or ''some'' occur; and these words are the marks of a variable and a formal implication".{{sfn |Russell |1903 |pp=5–6}}

As expressed by Russell "the process of transforming constants in a proposition into variables leads to what is called generalization, and gives us, as it were, the formal essence of a proposition ... So long as any term in our proposition can be turned into a variable, our proposition can be generalized; and so long as this is possible, it is the business of mathematics to do it";{{sfn |Russell |1903 |p=7}} these generalizations Russell named ''propositional functions''".{{sfn |Russell |1903 |p=19}} Indeed he cites and quotes from Frege's ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' and presents a vivid example from Frege's 1891 ''Function und Begriff'': That "the essence of the arithmetical function 2''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'' is what is left when the x is taken away, i.e., in the above instance 2(&amp;nbsp;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;). The argument ''x'' does not belong to the function but the two taken together make the whole".{{sfn |Russell |1903 |p=505}} Russell agreed with Frege's notion of "function" in one sense: "He regards functions – and in this I agree with him – as more fundamental than predicates and relations" but Russell rejected Frege's "theory of subject and assertion", in particular "he thinks that, if a term ''a'' occurs in a proposition, the proposition can always be analysed into ''a'' and an assertion about ''a''".{{sfn |Russell |1903 |p=505}}

===Evolution of Russell's notion of "function" 1908–1913===
Russell would carry his ideas forward in his 1908 ''Mathematical logical as based on the theory of types'' and into his and Whitehead's 1910–1913 ''Principia Mathematica''. By the time of ''Principia Mathematica'' Russell, like Frege, considered the propositional function fundamental: "Propositional functions are the fundamental kind from which the more usual kinds of function, such as "sin ''x''" or log x or "the father of x" are derived. These derivative functions . . . are called "descriptive functions". The functions of propositions . . . are a particular case of propositional functions".&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1910–1913:15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Propositional function]]s''': Because his terminology is different from the contemporary, the reader may be confused by Russell's "propositional function". An example may help. Russell writes a '''propositional function''' in its raw form, e.g., as ''φŷ'': "''ŷ'' is hurt". (Observe the circumflex or "hat" over the variable ''y''). For our example, we will assign just 4 values to the variable ''ŷ'': "Bob", "This bird", "Emily the rabbit", and "''y''". Substitution of one of these values for variable ''ŷ'' yields a '''proposition'''; this proposition is called a "value" of the propositional function. In our example there are four values of the propositional function, e.g., "Bob is hurt", "This bird is hurt", "Emily the rabbit is hurt" and "''y'' is hurt." A proposition, if it is '''significant'''—i.e., if its truth is '''determinate'''—has a '''truth-value''' of ''truth'' or ''falsity''. If a proposition's truth value is "truth" then the variable's value is said to '''satisfy''' the propositional function. Finally, per Russell's definition, "a ''class'' [set] is all objects satisfying some propositional function" (p.&amp;nbsp;23). Note the word "all'" – this is how the contemporary notions of "For all ∀" and "there exists at least one instance ∃" enter the treatment (p.&amp;nbsp;15).

To continue the example: Suppose (from outside the mathematics/logic) one determines that the propositions "Bob is hurt" has a truth value of "falsity", "This bird is hurt" has a truth value of "truth", "Emily the rabbit is hurt" has an indeterminate truth value because "Emily the rabbit" doesn't exist, and "''y'' is hurt" is ambiguous as to its truth value because the argument ''y'' itself is ambiguous. While the two propositions "Bob is hurt" and "This bird is hurt" are ''significant'' (both have truth values), only the value "This bird" of the ''variable'' ''ŷ'' ''satisfies'' the propositional function ''φŷ'': "''ŷ'' is hurt". When one goes to form the class α: ''φŷ'': "''ŷ'' is hurt", only "This bird" is included, given the four values "Bob", "This bird", "Emily the rabbit" and "''y''" for variable ''ŷ'' and their respective truth-values: falsity, truth, indeterminate, ambiguous.

Russell defines '''functions of propositions with arguments''', and '''truth-functions''' ''f(p)''.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead and Russell 1910–1913:6, 8 respectively&lt;/ref&gt; For example, suppose one were to form the "function of propositions with arguments" p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: "NOT(p) AND q" and assign its variables the values of ''p'': "Bob is hurt" and ''q'': "This bird is hurt". (We are restricted to  the logical linkages NOT, AND, OR and IMPLIES, and we can only assign "significant" propositions to the variables ''p'' and ''q''). Then the "function of propositions with arguments" is p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: NOT("Bob is hurt") AND "This bird is hurt". To determine the truth value of this "function of propositions with arguments" we submit it to a "truth function", e.g., ''f(p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)'': ''f''( NOT("Bob is hurt") AND "This bird is hurt" ), which yields a truth value of "truth".

'''The notion of a "many-one" functional relation"''': Russell first discusses the notion of "identity", then defines a '''descriptive function''' (pages 30ff) as the '''unique''' value ''ιx'' that satisfies the (2-variable) propositional function (i.e., "relation") ''φŷ''.
:''N.B. The reader should be warned here that the order of the variables are reversed! ''y'' is the independent variable and ''x'' is the dependent variable, e.g., x = sin(y)''.&lt;ref&gt;Something similar appears in {{harvnb |Tarski |1946}}. Tarski refers to a "relational function" as a "ONE-MANY [sic!] or FUNCTIONAL RELATION or simply a FUNCTION". Tarski comments about this reversal of variables on page 99.&lt;/ref&gt;
Russell symbolizes the descriptive function as "the object standing in relation to ''y''": R'y =&lt;sub&gt;DEF&lt;/sub&gt; (''ιx'')(''x R y''). Russell repeats that "''R'y'' is a function of ''y'', but not a propositional function [sic]; we shall call it a ''descriptive'' function. All the ordinary functions of mathematics are of this kind. Thus in our notation "sin ''y''" would be written " sin '' 'y'' ", and "sin" would stand for the relation sin '' 'y'' has to ''y''".&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead and Russell 1910–1913:31. This paper is important enough that van Heijenoort reprinted it as {{harvnb |Whitehead |Russell |1910}} ''Incomplete symbols: Descriptions'' with commentary by W. V. Quine in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |pp=216–223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The formalist's "function": David Hilbert's axiomatization of mathematics (1904–1927)==
[[David Hilbert]] set himself the goal of "formalizing" classical mathematics "as a formal axiomatic theory, and this theory shall be proved to be consistent, i.e., free from contradiction".{{sfn |Kleene |1952 |p=53}} In {{harvnb |Hilbert |1927}} ''The Foundations of Mathematics'' he frames the notion of function in terms of the existence of an "object":
: 13. A(a) --&gt; A(ε(A)) Here ε(A) stands for an object of which the proposition A(a) certainly holds if it holds of any object at all; let us call ε the logical ε-function".&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; [The arrow indicates "implies".]
Hilbert then illustrates the three ways how the ε-function is to be used, firstly as the "for all" and "there exists" notions, secondly to represent the "object of which [a proposition] holds", and lastly how to cast it into the [[choice function]].

'''Recursion theory and computability''': But the unexpected outcome of Hilbert's and his student [[Bernays]]'s effort was failure; see [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] of 1931. At about the same time, in an effort to solve Hilbert's [[Entscheidungsproblem]], mathematicians set about to define what was meant by an "effectively calculable function" ([[Alonzo Church]] 1936), i.e., "effective method" or "[[algorithm]]", that is, an explicit, step-by-step procedure that would succeed in computing a function. Various models for algorithms appeared, in rapid succession, including Church's [[lambda calculus]] (1936), [[Stephen Kleene]]'s [[mu-recursive function|μ-recursive functions]](1936) and [[Alan Turing]]'s (1936–7) notion of replacing human "computers" with utterly-mechanical "computing machines" (see [[Turing machine]]s).  It was shown that all of these models could compute the same class of [[computable function]]s. [[Church's thesis]] holds that this class of functions exhausts all the [[number-theoretic function]]s that can be calculated by an algorithm. The outcomes of these efforts were vivid demonstrations that, in Turing's words, "there can be no general process for determining whether a given formula ''U'' of the functional calculus '''K''' [''Principia Mathematica''] is provable";&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7 in {{cite book |first=Martin |last=Davis |authorlink=Martin Davis |title=The undecidable: basic papers on undecidable propositions, unsolvable problems and computable functions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qW8x7sQ4JXgC |year=1965 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |isbn=978-0-486-43228-1 |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; see more at [[Independence (mathematical logic)]] and [[Computability theory]].

==Development of the set-theoretic definition of "function"==
Set theory began with the work of the logicians with the notion of "class" (modern "set") for example {{harvtxt |De Morgan |1847}}, [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]] (1880), {{harvtxt |Venn |1881}}, {{harvtxt |Frege |1879}} and {{harvtxt |Peano |1889}}. It was given a push by [[Georg Cantor]]'s attempt to define the infinite in set-theoretic treatment (1870–1890) and a subsequent discovery of an [[antinomy]] (contradiction, paradox) in this treatment ([[Cantor's paradox]]), by Russell's discovery (1902) of an antinomy in Frege's 1879 ([[Russell's paradox]]), by the discovery of more antinomies in the early 20th century (e.g., the 1897 [[Burali-Forti paradox]] and the 1905 [[Richard paradox]]), and by resistance to Russell's complex treatment of logic{{sfn |Kleene |1952 |p=45}} and dislike of his [[axiom of reducibility]]&lt;ref&gt;"The nonprimitive and arbitrary character of this axiom drew forth severe criticism, and much of subsequent refinement of the logistic program lies in attempts to devise some method of avoiding the disliked axiom of reducibility" {{harvnb |Eves |1990 |p=268}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (1908, 1910–1913) that he proposed as a means to evade the antinomies.

===Russell's paradox 1902===
In 1902 Russell sent a letter to Frege pointing out that Frege's 1879 ''Begriffsschrift'' allowed a function to be an argument of itself: "On the other hand, it may also be that the argument is determinate and the function indeterminate . . .."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Frege |1879}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this unconstrained situation Russell was able to form a paradox:
:"You state ... that a function, too, can act as the indeterminate element. This I formerly believed, but now this view seems doubtful to me because of the following contradiction. Let ''w'' be the predicate: to be a predicate that cannot be predicated of itself. Can ''w'' be predicated of itself?"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt |Russell |1902}} ''Letter to Frege'' in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Frege responded promptly that "Your discovery of the contradiction caused me the greatest surprise and, I would almost say, consternation, since it has shaken the basis on which I intended to build arithmetic".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt |Frege |1902}} ''Letter to Russell'' in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this point forward development of the foundations of mathematics became an exercise in how to dodge "Russell's paradox", framed as it was in "the bare [set-theoretic] notions of set and element".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort's commentary to Russell's ''Letter to Frege'' in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zermelo's set theory (1908) modified by Skolem (1922)===
The notion of "function" appears as Zermelo's axiom III—the Axiom of Separation (Axiom der Aussonderung). This axiom constrains us to use a propositional function Φ(x) to "separate" a subset M&lt;sub&gt;Φ&lt;/sub&gt; from a previously formed set M:
: "AXIOM III. (Axiom of separation). Whenever the propositional function Φ(x) is definite for all elements of a set M, M possesses a subset M&lt;sub&gt;Φ&lt;/sub&gt; containing as elements precisely those elements x of M for which Φ(x) is true".&lt;ref&gt;The original uses an Old High German symbol in place of Φ cf {{harvnb |Zermelo |1908a}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As there is no universal set—sets originate by way of Axiom II from elements of (non-set) ''domain B'' – "...this disposes of the Russell antinomy so far as we are concerned".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Zermelo |1908a}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Zermelo's "definite criterion" is imprecise, and is fixed by Weyl, Fraenkel, Skolem, and von Neumann.&lt;ref&gt;cf van Heijenoort's commentary before Zermelo 1908 ''Investigations in the foundations of set theory I'' in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact Skolem in his 1922 referred to this "definite criterion" or "property" as a "definite proposition":
:"... a finite expression constructed from elementary propositions of the form ''a'' ε ''b'' or ''a'' = ''b'' by means of the five operations [logical conjunction, disjunction, negation, universal quantification, and existential quantification].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Skolem |1922}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |pp=292–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Van Heijenoort|van Heijenoort]] summarizes:
:"A property is definite in Skolem's sense if it is expressed . . . by a well-formed formula in the simple predicate calculus of first order in which the sole predicate constants are ε and possibly, =. ... Today an axiomatization of set theory is usually embedded in a logical calculus, and it is [[Hermann Weyl|Weyl's]] and Skolem's approach to the formulation of the axiom of separation that is generally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort's introduction to Abraham Fraenkel's ''The notion "definite" and the independence of the axiom of choice'' in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=285}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this quote the reader may observe a shift in terminology: nowhere is mentioned the notion of "propositional function", but rather one sees the words "formula", "predicate calculus", "predicate", and "logical calculus." This shift in terminology is discussed more in the section that covers "function" in contemporary set theory.

===The Wiener–Hausdorff–Kuratowski "ordered pair" definition 1914–1921===
The history of the notion of "ordered pair" is not clear. As noted above, Frege (1879) proposed an intuitive ordering in his definition of a two-argument function Ψ(A, B). [[Norbert Wiener]] in his 1914 (see below) observes that his own treatment essentially "revert(s) to [[Ernst Schröder|Schröder's]] treatment of a relation as a class of ordered couples".&lt;ref&gt;But Wiener offers no date or reference cf {{harvnb |Wiener |1914}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt |Russell |1903}} considered the definition of a relation (such as Ψ(A, B)) as a "class of couples" but rejected it:
:"There is a temptation to regard a relation as definable in extension as a class of couples. This is the formal advantage that it avoids the necessity for the primitive proposition asserting that every couple has a relation holding between no other pairs of terms. But it is necessary to give sense to the couple, to distinguish the referent [''domain''] from the relatum [''converse domain'']: thus a couple becomes essentially distinct from a class of two terms, and must itself be introduced as a primitive idea. . . . It seems therefore more correct to take an intensional view of relations, and to identify them rather with class-concepts than with classes."{{sfn |Russell |1903 |p=99}}

By 1910–1913 and ''Principia Mathematica'' Russell had given up on the requirement for an [[Intensional statement|intensional]] definition of a relation, stating that "mathematics is always concerned with extensions rather than intensions" and "Relations, like classes, are to be taken in ''extension''".&lt;ref&gt;both quotes from {{harvnb |Whitehead |Russell |1913 |p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; To demonstrate the notion of a relation in [[Extension (predicate logic)|extension]] Russell now embraced the notion of ''ordered couple'': "We may regard a relation ... as a class of couples ... the relation determined by φ(''x, y'') is the class of couples (''x, y'') for which  φ(''x, y'') is true". {{sfn |Whitehead |Russell |1913 |p=26}}  In a footnote he clarified his notion and arrived at this definition:
:"Such a couple has a ''sense'', i.e., the couple (''x, y'') is different from the couple (''y, x'') unless ''x = y''. We shall call it a "couple with sense," ... it may also be called an ''ordered couple''. {{sfn |Whitehead |Russell |1913 |p=26}}
But he goes on to say that he would not introduce the ordered couples further into his "symbolic treatment"; he proposes his "matrix" and his unpopular axiom of reducibility in their place.

An attempt to solve the problem of the [[antinomies]] led Russell to propose his "doctrine of types" in an appendix B of his 1903 ''The Principles of Mathematics''.{{sfn |Russell |1903 |pp=523–529}} In a few years he would refine this notion and propose in his 1908 ''The Theory of Types'' two [[axiom of reducibility|axioms of reducibility]], the purpose of which were to reduce (single-variable) propositional functions and (dual-variable) relations to a "lower" form (and ultimately into a completely [[extensional]] form); he and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] would carry this treatment over to ''Principia Mathematica'' 1910–1913 with a further refinement called "a matrix".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Principia Mathematica  |chapter=*12 The Hierarchy of Types and the axiom of Reducibility |year=1913 |page=161 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rdMgDpNSdLsC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first axiom is *12.1; the second is *12.11. To quote Wiener the second axiom *12.11 "is involved only in the theory of relations".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Wiener |1914}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both axioms, however, were met with skepticism and resistance; see more at [[Axiom of reducibility]]. By 1914 Norbert Wiener, using Whitehead and Russell's symbolism, eliminated axiom *12.11 (the "two-variable" (relational) version of the axiom of reducibility) by expressing a relation as an [[ordered pair]] "using the null set. At approximately the same time, [[Felix Hausdorff|Hausdorff]] (1914, p. 32) gave the definition of the ordered pair (a, b) as { {a,1}, {b, 2} }. A few years later [[Kuratowski]] (1921) offered a definition that has been widely used ever since, namely { {a, b}, {a} }".&lt;ref&gt;commentary by van Heijenoort preceding {{harvnb |Wiener |1914}} ''A simplification of the logic of relations'' in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=224}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by {{harvtxt |Suppes |1960}} "This definition . . . was historically important in reducing the theory of relations to the theory of sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Suppes |1960 |p=32}}. This same point appears in van Heijenoort's commentary before {{harvtxt |Wiener |1914}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=224}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Observe that while Wiener "reduced" the relational *12.11 form of the axiom of reducibility he ''did not'' reduce nor otherwise change the propositional-function form *12.1; indeed he declared this "essential to the treatment of identity, descriptions, classes and relations".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Wiener |1914}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schönfinkel's notion of "function" as a many-one "correspondence" 1924===
Where exactly the ''general'' notion of "function" as a many-one correspondence derives from is unclear. Russell in his 1920 ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'' states that "It should be observed that all mathematical functions result form one-many [sic – contemporary usage is many-one] relations . . . Functions in this sense are ''descriptive'' functions".{{sfn |Russell |1920 |p=46}} A reasonable possibility is the ''Principia Mathematica'' notion of "descriptive function" – ''R 'y'' =&lt;sub&gt;DEF&lt;/sub&gt; (ι''x'')(''x R y''): "the singular object that has a relation ''R'' to ''y''". Whatever the case, by 1924, [[Moses Schönfinkel]] expressed the notion, claiming it to be "well known":
:"As is well known, by function we mean in the simplest case a correspondence between the elements of some domain of quantities, the argument domain, and those of a domain of function values ... such that to each argument value there corresponds at most one function value".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt |Schönfinkel |1924}} ''On the building blocks of mathematical logic'' in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Willard Quine]], {{harvnb |Schönfinkel |1924}} "provide[s] for ... the whole sweep of abstract set theory. The crux of the matter is that Schönfinkel lets functions stand as arguments. For Schönfinkel, substantially as for Frege, classes are special sorts of functions. They are propositional functions, functions whose values are truth values. All functions, propositional and otherwise, are for Schönfinkel one-place functions".&lt;ref&gt;commentary by W. V. Quine preceding {{harvtxt |Schönfinkel |1924}} ''On the building blocks of mathematical logic'' in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=356}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Remarkably, Schönfinkel reduces all mathematics to an extremely compact ''functional calculus'' consisting of only three functions: Constancy, fusion (i.e., composition), and mutual exclusivity. Quine notes that [[Haskell Curry]] (1958) carried this work forward "under the head of [[combinatory logic]]".&lt;ref&gt;cf ''Curry and Feys 1958''; Quine in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=357}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Von Neumann's set theory 1925===
By 1925 [[Abraham Fraenkel]] (1922) and [[Thoralf Skolem]] (1922) had amended Zermelo's set theory of 1908. But von Neumann was not convinced that this axiomatization could not lead to the antinomies.&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann's critique of the history observes the split between the logicists (e.g., Russell et. al.) and the set-theorists (e.g., Zermelo et. al.) and the formalists (e.g., Hilbert), cf {{harvnb |von Neumann |1925}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |pp=394–396}}.&lt;/ref&gt; So he proposed his own theory, his 1925 ''An axiomatization of set theory''.&lt;ref&gt;In addition to the 1925 appearance in van Heijenoort, Suppes 1970:12 cites two more: 1928a and 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; It explicitly contains a "contemporary", set-theoretic version of the notion of "function":
:"[Unlike Zermelo's set theory] [w]e prefer, however, to axiomatize not "set" but "function". The latter notion certainly includes the former. (More precisely, the two notions are completely equivalent, since a function can be regarded as a set of pairs, and a set as a function that can take two values.)".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |von Neumann |1925}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outset he begins with ''I-objects'' and ''II-objects'', two objects ''A'' and ''B'' that are I-objects (first axiom), and two types of "operations" that assume ordering as a structural property&lt;ref&gt;In his 1930-1931 ''The Philosophy of Mathematics and Hilbert's Proof Theory'' Bernays asserts (in the context of rebutting Logicism's construction of the numbers from logical axioms) that "the Number concept turns out to be an elementary ''structural concept''". This paper appears on page 243 in Paolo Mancosu 1998 ''From Brouwer to Hilbert'', Oxford University Press, NY, {{isbn|0-19-509632-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; obtained of the resulting objects [''x'', ''y''] and (''x'', ''y''). The two "domains of objects" are called "arguments" (I-objects) and "functions" (II-objects); where they overlap are the "argument functions" (he calls them I-II objects). He introduces two "universal two-variable operations" – (i) the operation [x, y]: ". . . read 'the value of the function ''x'' for the argument ''y'' . . . it itself is a type I object", and (ii) the operation (''x, y''): ". . . (read 'the ordered pair x, y') whose variables ''x'' and ''y'' must both be arguments and that itself produces an argument (''x, y''). Its most important property is that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; follow from (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)". To clarify the function pair he notes that "Instead of ''f''(''x'') we write [''f,x''] to indicate that ''f'', just like ''x'', is to be regarded as a variable in this procedure". To avoid the "antinomies of naive set theory, in Russell's first of all . . . we must forgo treating certain functions as arguments".&lt;ref&gt;All quotes from {{harvnb |von Neumann |1925}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |pp=396–398}}&lt;/ref&gt; He adopts a notion from Zermelo to restrict these "certain functions".&lt;ref&gt;This notion is not easy to summarize; see more at {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=397}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppes&lt;ref&gt;See also van Heijenoort's introduction to von Neumann's paper on pages 393–394.&lt;/ref&gt; observes that von Neumann's axiomatization was modified by Bernays "in order to remain nearer to the original Zermelo system . . . He introduced two membership relations: one between sets, and one between sets and classes". Then Gödel [1940]&lt;ref&gt;cf in particular p. 35 where Gödel declares his primitive notions to be class, set, and "the dyadic ''relation ε'' between class and class, class and set, set and class, or set and set". Gödel 1940 ''The consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum hypothesis with the axioms of set theory'' appearing on pages 33ff in Volume II of ''Kurt Godel Collected Works'', Oxford University Press, NY, {{isbn|0-19-514721-9}} (v.2, pbk).&lt;/ref&gt; further modified the theory: "his primitive notions are those of set, class and membership (although membership alone is sufficient)".&lt;ref&gt;All quotes from {{harvnb |Suppes  |1960 |p=12}} footnote. He also references "a paper by R. M. Robinson [1937] [that] provides a simplified system close to von Neumann's original one".&lt;/ref&gt; This axiomatization is now known as [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]].

===Bourbaki 1939===
In 1939, [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]], in addition to giving the well-known ordered pair definition of a function as a certain subset of the cartesian product E x F, gave the following:

"Let E and F be two sets, which may or may not be distinct. A relation between a variable element x of E and a variable element y of F is called a functional relation in y if, for all x ∈ E, there exists a unique y ∈ F which is in the given relation with x.
"We give the name of function to the operation which in this way associates with every element x ∈ E the element y ∈ F which is in the given relation with x, and the function is said to be determined by the given functional relation. Two equivalent functional relations determine the same function."

==Since 1950==

===Notion of "function" in contemporary set theory===
Both axiomatic and naive forms of Zermelo's set theory as modified by Fraenkel (1922) and Skolem (1922) ''define'' "function" as a relation, ''define'' a relation as a set of ordered pairs, and ''define'' an ordered pair as a set of two "dissymetric" sets.

While the reader of {{harvtxt |Suppes |1960}} ''Axiomatic Set Theory'' or {{harvtxt |Halmos |1970}} ''Naive Set Theory'' observes the use of function-symbolism in the ''axiom of separation'', e.g., φ(x) (in Suppes) and S(x) (in Halmos), they will see no mention of "proposition" or even "first order predicate calculus". In their place are "''expressions'' of the object language", "atomic formulae", "primitive formulae", and "atomic sentences".

{{harvtxt |Kleene |1952}} defines the words as follows: "In word languages, a proposition is expressed by a sentence. Then a 'predicate' is expressed by an incomplete sentence or sentence skeleton containing an open place. For example, "___ is a man" expresses a predicate ... The predicate is a ''propositional function of one variable''. Predicates are often called 'properties' ... The predicate calculus will treat of the logic of predicates in this general sense of 'predicate', i.e., as propositional function".{{sfn |Kleene |1952 |pp=143–145}}

In 1954, Bourbaki, on p.&amp;nbsp;76 in Chapitre II of Theorie des Ensembles (theory of sets), gave a definition of a function as a triple ''f'' = (''F'', ''A'', ''B'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Elements de Mathematique,Theorie des Ensembles |author=N.Bourbaki |authorlink=Nicolas Bourbaki |publisher=Hermann &amp; cie |page=76 |year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here ''F'' is a ''functional graph'', meaning a set of pairs where no two pairs have the same first member.  On p.&amp;nbsp;77 (''op. cit.'') Bourbaki states (literal translation): "Often we shall use, in the remainder of this Treatise, the word ''function'' instead of ''functional graph''."

{{harvtxt |Suppes |1960}} in ''Axiomatic Set Theory'', formally defines a ''relation'' (p.&amp;nbsp;57) as a set of pairs, and a ''function'' (p.&amp;nbsp;86) as a relation where no two pairs have the same first member.

===Relational form of a function===
The reason for the disappearance of the words "propositional function" e.g., in {{harvtxt |Suppes |1960}}, and {{harvtxt |Halmos |1970}}, is explained by {{harvtxt |Tarski |1946}} together with further explanation of the terminology:
:"An expression such as ''x is an integer'', which contains variables and, on replacement of these variables by constants becomes a sentence, is called a SENTENTIAL [i.e., propositional cf his index] FUNCTION. But mathematicians, by the way, are not very fond of this expression, because they use the term "function" with a different meaning. ... sentential functions and sentences composed entirely of mathematical symbols (and not words of everyday language), such as: ''x + y = 5'' are usually referred to by mathematicians as FORMULAE. In place of "sentential function" we shall sometimes simply say "sentence" – but only in cases where there is no danger of any misunderstanding".{{sfn |Tarski |1946 |p=5}}
For his part Tarski calls the relational form of function a "FUNCTIONAL RELATION or simply a FUNCTION".{{sfn |Tarski |1946 |p=98}} After a discussion of this "functional relation" he asserts that:
:"The concept of a function which we are considering now differs essentially from the concepts of a sentential [propositional] and of a designatory function .... Strictly speaking ... [these] do not belong to the domain of logic or mathematics; they denote certain categories of expressions which serve to compose logical and mathematical statements, but they do not denote things treated of in those statements... . The term "function" in its new sense, on the other hand, is an expression of a purely logical character; it designates a certain type of things dealt with in logic and mathematics."{{sfn |Tarski |1946 |p=102}}

As a small child during [[World War II]] Abram was an internee in Japanese camps.&lt;ref&gt;http://lbs.hh.schule.de/interkulturell/hamburg/handbuch-kapitel/anhang.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After liberation his family returned to the Netherlands. Abram studied mathematics and philosophy at the University of Amsterdam. He is professor of [[pedagogy]] (theory of teaching) at that institute and has published on topics regarding Jewish culture and identity, multicultural education and "Education after Auschwitz". He has been the first European professor for "Holocaust Education" since 1990.

He has developed a model known as the ‘five-slice pie chart’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhm.nl/documenten/Schijf+van+5k+-+IdoAbram.eng.pdf|title=Joods Historisch Museum - Joods Cultureel Kwartier|website=www.jhm.nl|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195425/http://www.jhm.nl/documenten/Schijf%20van%205k%20-%20IdoAbram.eng.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to illustrate the different ways of being [[Judaism|Jewish]]. He says there are five aspects that in some way affect the life of every Jew. These are "religion and tradition", "the tie with [[Israel]] and [[Zionism]]", '"war persecution and survival", "personal history" and the "exchange between Jewish and Dutch cultures".  Just how heavily these different aspects weigh on each person individually depends on the place and time in which one lives. During the course of a person’s life the various aspects may alter in importance.

==Biography==
Ihab Hassan was born in [[Cairo]], Egypt, and emigrated to the United States in 1946. He was Emeritus Vilas Research Professor at the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]]. His writings include ''Radical Innocence: Studies in the Contemporary American Novel'' (1961), ''The Literature of Silence: Henry Miller and Samuel Beckett'' (1967), ''The Dismemberment of Orpheus: Toward a Postmodern Literature'' (1971, 1982), ''Paracriticisms: Seven Speculations of the Times'' (1975), ''The Right Promethean Fire: Imagination, Science, and Cultural Change'' (1980), ''The Postmodern Turn: Essays in Postmodern Theory and Culture'' (1987), ''Selves at Risk: Patterns of Quest in Contemporary American Letters'' (1990), and ''Rumors of Change: Essays of Five Decades'' (1995), as well as two memoirs, ''Out of Egypt: Scenes and Arguments of an Autobiography'' (1985) and ''Between the Eagle and the Sun: Traces of Japan'' (1996). Recently, he has published many short stories in various literary magazines and is completing a novel, ''The Changeling''. His last published work was ''In Quest of Nothing: Selected Essays, 1998-2008'' (2010). In addition, he has written more than 300 essays and reviews on literary and cultural subjects.

Hassan received honorary degrees from the Faculty of Humanities at [[Uppsala University]], [[Sweden]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/&lt;/ref&gt; (1996) and the University of Giessen (1999), two [[Guggenheim Fellowships]] (1958, 1962), and three Senior Fulbright Lectureships (1966, 1974, 1975). He was on the Faculty of the School of Letters, Indiana University (1964), Visiting Fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (1972), twice on the Faculty of the Salzburg Summer Seminars in American Studies (1965,1975), Senior Fellow at the Camargo Foundation in Cassis (1974–1975), Resident Scholar at the Rockefeller Study Center in Bellagio (1978), twice a Senior Fellow at the Humanities Research Center in Canberra (1990, 2003), Resident Fellow at the Humanities Research Institute of the University of California, Irvine (1990), on the Faculty of the Stuttgart Summer Seminars in Cultural Studies (1991), and three times on the Faculty of the Scandinavian Summer School of Literary Theory and Criticism in Karlskrona (2000, 20001, 2004).  He has also received the Alumni Teaching Award and the Honors Program Teaching Award at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, where he has taught for 29 years. In addition he has delivered more than 500 public lectures in North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.

The following table is taken from a part of ''The Dismemberment of Orpheus'' that was reprinted in ''Postmodern American Fiction: A Norton Anthology'' (1998). It seeks to explain the differences, both concrete and abstract, between [[modernism]] and [[postmodernism]].

Hassan's Table of Differences between Modernism and Postmodernism ends with the statement (The Dismemberment of Orpheus, p.&amp;nbsp;269): "Yet the dichotomies this table represents remain insecure, equivocal. For differences shift, defer, even collapse; concepts in any one vertical column are not all equivalent; and inversions and exceptions, in both modernism and postmodernism, abound."

==Background==
Born in [[Glen Cove, New York]] on [[Long Island]], Hecht attended [[Adelphi University]] where she earned a BA in history, for a time studying at the Université de Caen, and the Université d'Angers. She earned her PhD in the [[History of Science]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1995 and taught at [[Nassau Community College]] from 1994 to 2007, finally as a tenured associate professor of history. Hecht has taught in the MFA programs at [[The New School]] and [[Columbia University]], and is a fellow of the [[New York Institute for the Humanities]].

Hecht is married and has two children.

She has appeared on television on the [[Discovery Channel]], ''[[The Morning Show with Marcus Smith]]'', ''Road to Reason'' and [[MSNBC]]'s ''Hardball'',&lt;ref name=FriendlyAtheist&gt;{{cite web|last=Fidalgo|first=Paul|title=Jennifer Michael Hecht and Ron Reagan Talk Atheism in Politics on 'Hardball'|date=December 29, 2013|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2013/12/29/hecht_hardball/|work=Friendly Atheist|publisher=Patheos|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on radio on ''[[The Brian Lehrer Show]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brian|first=Lehrer|authorlink=Brian Lehrer|title=Reasons to Live|date=December 12, 2013|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/reasons-live/|work=The Brian Lehrer Show|publisher=New York Public Radio|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Leonard Lopate Show]]'', ''[[On Being]]'' (formerly known as ''Speaking of Faith''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tippett|first=Krista|authorlink=Krista Tippett|title=Jennifer Michael Hecht - A History of Doubt|date=January 8, 2009|url=http://www.onbeing.org/program/history-doubt/51|work=On Being|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tippett|first=Krista|title=Jennifer Michael Hecht - Suicide, and Hope for Our Future Selves|date=December 10, 2015|url=http://www.onbeing.org/program/jennifer-michael-hecht-hope-for-our-future-selves/20140327|work=On Being|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[All Things Considered]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conan|first=Neal|title=Doubt: A History|date=November 13, 2003 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1505065|work=All Things Considered|publisher=NPR|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Joy Cardin Show'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cardin|first=Joy|title=Against Suicide|date=December 11, 2013|url=http://www.wpr.org/people/jennifer-michael-hecht|work=The Joy Cardin Show|publisher=Wisconsin Public Radio|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

==Intellectual interests and writings==
Of her three major intellectual interests, she ranks them, "Poetry came first, then historical scholarship, then public atheism, and they probably remain in that order in my dedication to them."&lt;ref name=TheBestSchoolsInterview&gt;{{cite web|title=Jennifer Michael Hecht Interview|url=http://www.thebestschools.org/features/jennifer-michael-hecht-interview/|work=TheBestSchools|publisher=TheBestSchools.org|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally intending to be a poet, she was drawn to the history of science. Her first book, ''[[The End of the Soul: Scientific Modernity, Atheism, and Anthropology in France, 1876-1936]]'', grew out of her dissertation on some late 19th-century anthropologists who formed the [[Society of Mutual Autopsy]]. The members would dissect each other's brains after death, and Hecht, having noticed their atheism, came to understand that this was being done not only for the sake of scientific finds, but perhaps to prove to the Catholic Church that the soul does not exist.

While researching her first book, she came to realize that there was no sufficient history of atheism, and that led to her second book, ''[[Doubt: A History: The Great Doubters and Their Legacy of Innovation from Socrates and Jesus to Thomas Jefferson and Emily Dickinson|Doubt: A History]]''.

While writing ''Doubt'', she found that many atheists went beyond simply stating that there are no gods and also made profound suggestions about how people should think of life and how we should live. That led to her third book, ''The Happiness Myth'', which starts there and goes on to look at present-day attitudes about how to be happy. She calls it "a work of Skepticism in the modern sense of debunking."&lt;ref name=TheBestSchoolsInterview /&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{quote box|align=right|quote=A culture that invents&lt;br&gt;escalators and Stairmasters&lt;br&gt;is a culture that needs to&lt;br&gt;assess what it's actually&lt;br&gt;talking about.|source=—Jennifer Michael Hecht&lt;br&gt;from an&lt;br&gt;interview by [[D.J. Grothe]]&lt;br&gt;on ''[[Point of Inquiry]]'' podcast&lt;ref name=POI /&gt;}}

Hecht believes that, "the basic modern assumptions about how to be happy are nonsense." In a review of her book, ''The Happiness Myth'' for ''The New York Times'', Alison McCulloch summed it up, "What you think you should do to be happy, like getting fitter and thinner, is part of a 'cultural code' — 'an unscientific web of symbolic cultural fantasies' — and once you realize this, you will perhaps feel a little more free to be a lot more happy."&lt;ref name=nytimesreview&gt;{{cite web|last=McCulloch|first=Alison|title=Get Happy|date=May 6, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/books/review/McCulloch.t.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times Sunday Book Review|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in an interview on the ''[[Point of Inquiry]]'' podcast in 2007,&lt;ref name=POI&gt;{{cite web|title=Jennifer Michael Hecht - The Happiness Myth|date=May 25, 2007|author=Grothe, D.J.|authorlink=DJ Grothe|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/jennifer_michael_hecht_the_happiness_myth|publisher=Center for Inquiry|accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; she said "I'm not trying really to get somebody out of depression, but I sure am trying to get people to not be so worried, so anxious over things that really don't matter."

She has written against agnosticism, calling "philosophically silly" the argument that because you can't prove a negative we have to allow for the possibility of God. "Either you doubt everything to the point where you can't speak, or you make reasoned decisions."&lt;ref name= TheBestSchoolsInterview /&gt;

Hecht is an anti-suicide advocate, writing an entire book (''Stay: A History of Suicide and the Philosophies Against It'') arguing against it. She believes not only that "Suicide is delayed homicide", but also "that you owe it to your future self to live".&lt;ref name=nytimesoped&gt;{{cite web|last=Brooks|first=David|title=The Irony of Despair|date=December 5, 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/06/opinion/brooks-the-irony-of-despair.html|work=The Opinion Pages|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She does not believe in life-after-death, urging that we should remember death and remember that it's the end. "I think this world is extraordinary and I also think it's a pain in the ass. And I'm happy to be here and I'm ok with not being here forever."&lt;ref name=POI /&gt;

She believes that morality is not magical, it is the attempt to do right. And rather than either being handed to us by God or just made up by each person, is inherent in human groups. "There are deep rules of morality that we as human beings, in human groups, 'invented' on biological and social and intellectual lines."

Her poetry and philosophy often intersect, and she has taught a course called "Poets and Philosophy" at the New School for many years. Her own taste is for poets who are concerned with philosophical or religious questions. "Leopardi's misery makes me as happy as Schopenhauer's does, though I am ever aware of the equal cacophony of birth and pleasure that shadow their admittedly much more deafening symphony of death and suffering. Dickinson I treasure beyond measure and think she's mostly on my side of the nonbeliever line; anyway, she's my number-one poet. Hopkins has a few rhyming hunks of pure passion, frustrated but wild, which I love with a love that is more than a love, but which only go so far. Donne is deep and great company, but he leans too much into comforting delusions for me, often when he is at his best in poetic chops and pyrotechnics. Rilke is a lifesaving self-help writer and a bit of a brilliant con artist."&lt;ref name=TheBestSchoolsInterview /&gt;

==Atheism==
Hecht was raised Jewish and believed in God until she was twelve when she had what she describes as a "Talking Heads headshift", standing in her parent's house saying, "This is not my beautiful couch, I am not your beautiful daughter." In the days that followed she came to see that "we are one species among great nature, and as the trees very slowly rot, so do our pampered haunches."&lt;ref name= TheBestSchoolsInterview /&gt; Eventually, she replaced faith in God with faith in humanity.

Hecht has been an outspoken member of the secular community since 2003, accepting the label "atheist" somewhat reluctantly. "Initially after writing my book Doubt, I avoided the atheist label, saying only that I did not believe in God. After some reflection, I realized I needed to defend what I truly believe. I now call myself an 'atheist,' and proudly."&lt;ref name=politico&gt;{{cite web|last=Hecht|first=Jennifer Michael|title=The Last Taboo|date=December 2013|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2013/12/the-last-taboo-atheists-politicians-100901.html|work=POLITICO Magazine|publisher=POLITICO LLC|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hecht is an honorary board member of the [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]]. In 2009, she told the FFRF convention audience: "If there is no God — and there isn't — then we [humans] made up morality. And I'm very impressed."

In her 2007 interview for the ''[[Point of Inquiry]]'' podcast,&lt;ref name=POI /&gt; when asked, "Do you think religion might actually be harmful for one's happiness?", she said, "Yes ... when I wrote ''Doubt'' it was very much to show people who felt that doubting religion or getting away from religion was painful. I find the world in which the natural world that we see {{em|is}} the world, in which we make up no other, I find that world to be the best one. I'm glad there's no afterlife. I like the world as it is. And I think that religion does add a tremendous amount of guilt and pain and trouble." Hecht does not, however, believe that religion is all bad. In that same interview, she went on to say, "The beautiful building and coming together and reminding oneself of community, of how we must each take the role that is given us, know yourself, remember death, control your desires, these are the big messages of wisdom. And religion got it right that you have to meditate on them for them to work."&lt;ref name=POI /&gt;

In a December 2013 article for ''[[Politico]]'' Magazine, Hecht examined "The Last Taboo" in American politics, atheism. Referencing newly retired Rep. [[Barney Frank]]'s lack of religious belief she wrote, "Was it really harder to come out as an atheist politician in 2013 than as a gay one 25 years ago?"&lt;ref name=politico /&gt;

==Published works==
Her debut poetry collection, ''The Next Ancient World'', artfully mixes contemporary and ancient world views, histories, and myths. In 2002 it received the Tupelo Press Judge's Prize in Poetry, the [[Norma Farber First Book Award]] from the [[Poetry Society of America]], as well as ForeWord Magazine's award for Poetry Book of the Year.&lt;ref name=poetryfoundation&gt;{{cite web|title=Jennifer Michael Hecht|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/jennifer-michael-hecht|publisher=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her second collection, ''Funny'', explores the implications of the human love of humor and jokes. It won the 2005 [[Felix Pollak]] Prize from the [[University of Wisconsin Press]]. Her most recent collection, ''Who Said'' ([[Copper Canyon Press]], 2013),&lt;ref name=coppercanyon&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Said|url=https://www.coppercanyonpress.org/pages/browse/book.asp?bg={F9984CF6-A755-4770-BE6D-508FAE27FBE4}|publisher=Copper Canyon Press|accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; playfully asks the title question of some of the most iconic English language poems.

In 2003 Hecht published two books of history and philosophy with two different publishers. The first, ''[[Doubt: A History: The Great Doubters and Their Legacy of Innovation from Socrates and Jesus to Thomas Jefferson and Emily Dickinson|Doubt: A History]]'', is an epic, worldwide study of religious [[doubt]] throughout history. The other, ''[[The End of the Soul]]'', is a profile of an unusual group of nineteenth-century French anthropologists who formed the [[Society of Mutual Autopsy]] to discover links between personality, ability and brain [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. It received the prestigious [[Ralph Waldo Emerson Award]] for 2004 from the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]] &lt;ref name=pbk&gt;{{cite web|title=Ralph Waldo Emerson Award — List of Previous Winners|url=http://www.pbk.org/infoview/PBK_Infoview.aspx?t=&amp;id=58|publisher=The Phi Beta Kappa Society|accessdate=February 6, 2014|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304051511/https://www.pbk.org/infoview/PBK_Infoview.aspx?t=&amp;id=58|archive-date=March 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "for scholarly studies that contribute significantly to interpretations of the intellectual and cultural condition of humanity." &lt;ref name=new_school&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty - Jennifer Michael Hecht|url=http://www.newschool.edu/public-engagement/school-of-writing-faculty/?id=27114|publisher=The New School|accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Hecht published ''The Happiness Myth: Why What We Think Is Right Is Wrong'' in which she attempts to examine happiness through historical perspective. Hecht maintains that our current perception of happiness is affected by culture, and that future generations may well mock our view of happiness as we make fun of earlier generations.

In 2013 Hecht published "Stay: A History of Suicide and the Philosophies Against It." It is a study of intellectual and cultural history, in which she channels her grief for two friends lost to suicide into a search for persuasive arguments against it; arguments she hopes to bring back into public consciousness.

"Lapouge's contribution to racism was a quantitative, well-written race theory that was replete with the language and tools of science. It was particularly appealing because it described a collection of human groups which sounded too scientific and clinical to be political."

'''John Adams''' (October 30 &amp;#91;[[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]] October 19&amp;#93;&amp;nbsp;1735&amp;nbsp;– July 4, 1826) was one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], serving as the first [[Vice Presidents of the United States|Vice President]] (1789–1797) and as the second [[President of the United States]] (1797–1801). He was a lawyer, diplomat, and leader of American independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. Adams was a dedicated diarist, and correspondent with his wife and advisor [[Abigail Adams|Abigail]], and recorded important historical information on the era.

A political activist prior to the [[American Revolution]], Adams was devoted to the [[right to counsel]] and [[presumption of innocence]]. He defied anti-British sentiment and successfully defended British soldiers against murder charges arising from the [[Boston Massacre]]. Adams was a [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] and became a principal leader of the Revolution. He assisted in drafting the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776 and was its foremost advocate in Congress. As a diplomat in Europe, he helped negotiate the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|peace treaty]] with Great Britain and secured vital governmental loans. Adams was the primary author of the [[Massachusetts Constitution]] in 1780, which influenced the United States' own [[United States Constitution|constitution]], as did his earlier ''[[Thoughts on Government]]''.

Adams was elected to two terms as vice president under [[George Washington]]. He then won election in [[United States presidential election, 1796|1796]] as president; during his single term, he encountered fierce criticism from the [[Jeffersonian Republicans]] and from some in his own [[Federalist Party]], led by his rival [[Alexander Hamilton]]. Adams signed the controversial [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] and built up the army and navy in the undeclared "[[Quasi-War]]" with France. The main accomplishment of his presidency was a [[Convention of 1800|peaceful resolution]] of this conflict in the face of public anger and Hamilton's opposition. He was the first president to reside in the executive mansion now known as the [[White House]].

Opposition from Federalists and accusations of despotism from Republicans led to Adams' [[United States presidential election, 1800|re-election]] loss to his former friend [[Thomas Jefferson]], and he retired to Massachusetts. He eventually resumed his friendship with Jefferson by initiating a correspondence that lasted fourteen years. He and his wife generated a family of politicians, diplomats, and historians now referred to as the [[Adams political family]], which includes their son [[John Quincy Adams]], the sixth president of the United States. John Adams died on the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, hours after Jefferson's death. Surveys of historians and scholars have [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|favorably ranked his administration]].

==Early life and education==

===Childhood===
[[File:John Adams birthplace, Quincy, Massachusetts.JPG|thumb|right|Adams' birthplace in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]]|alt=Small wooden house with red-brick chimney in the middle]]
John Adams was born on October 30, 1735, (October 19, 1735, [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]], [[Julian calendar]]) to [[John Adams Sr.]] and [[Susanna Boylston]]. He had two younger brothers, Peter and Elihu.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=11}} [[John Adams Birthplace|Adams' birthplace]] was on the family farm in Braintree, Massachusetts (now [[Quincy, Massachusetts]]).{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=317}} His mother was from a leading medical family of present-day [[Brookline, Massachusetts]]. His father was a [[deacon]] in the [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational Church]], a farmer, a [[cordwainer]], and a lieutenant in the [[Massachusetts National Guard|militia]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=29–30}} John Sr. served as a [[Board of selectmen|selectman]] (town councilman) and supervised the building of schools and roads. Adams often praised his father and recalled their close relationship.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=11–14}} Adams' great-grandfather [[Henry Adams (Braintree)|Henry Adams]] emigrated to Massachusetts from [[Braintree, Essex]], England, around 1638.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=29–30}}

Though raised in modest surroundings, Adams felt pressured to live up to his heritage. His was a family of [[Puritans]], who profoundly affected their region's culture, laws, and traditions. By the time of John Adams' birth, Puritan tenets such as [[predestination]] had waned and many of their severe practices moderated, but Adams still "considered them bearers of freedom, a cause that still had a holy urgency."{{sfn|Brookhiser|2002|p=13}} Adams recalled that his parents "held every Species of Libertinage in ... Contempt and horror," and detailed "pictures of disgrace, or baseness and of Ruin" resulting from any debauchery.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=11}}

Adams, as the eldest child, was compelled to obtain a formal education. This began at age six at a [[Dame school]] for boys and girls, conducted at a teacher's home, and was centered upon ''[[The New England Primer]]''. Shortly thereafter, Adams attended Braintree Latin School under Joseph Cleverly, where studies included [[Latin]], rhetoric, logic, and arithmetic. Adams' early education included incidents of [[truancy]], a dislike for his master, and a desire to become a farmer. All discussion on the matter ended with his father's command that he remain in school: "You shall comply with my desires." Deacon Adams hired a new schoolmaster named Joseph Marsh, and his son responded positively.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=12–14}}

===College education and adulthood===
At age sixteen, Adams entered [[Harvard College]] in 1751, studying under [[Joseph Mayhew]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=35}} As an adult, Adams was a keen scholar, studying the works of ancient writers such as [[Thucydides]], [[Plato]], [[Cicero]], and [[Tacitus]] in their original languages.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=13}} Though his father expected him to be a minister,{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=16}} after his 1755 graduation with an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B. degree]], he taught school temporarily in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], Massachusetts while pondering his permanent vocation. In the next four years, he began to seek prestige, craving "Honour or Reputation" and "more {{sic|def|ference|hide=y}} from [his] fellows", and was determined to be "a great Man." He decided to become a lawyer to further those ends, writing his father that he found among lawyers "noble and gallant achievements" but, among the clergy, the "pretended sanctity of some absolute dunces." His aspirations conflicted with his Puritanism, though, prompting reservations about his self-described "trumpery" and failure to share the "happiness of [his] fellow men."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=17–18}}

As the [[French and Indian War]] began in 1754, Adams, aged nineteen, began to struggle with his responsibility in the conflict as his many of his contemporaries joined the war for money. Adams later said, "I longed more ardently to be a Soldier than I ever did to be a Lawyer," recognizing that he was the first of his family to "[degenerate] from the virtues of the house so far as not to have been an officer in the militia."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=21}}

In 1756, Adams began [[reading law]] under John Putnam, a leading lawyer in Worcester.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=19}} In 1758, he earned an [[Master of Arts|A.M.]] from Harvard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/11/obama-joins-list-of-seven-presidents-with-harvard-degrees/ |title=Obama joins list of seven presidents with Harvard degrees |publisher=''The Harvard Gazette'' |date=November 6, 2008 |accessdate=December 5, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190338/http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/11/obama-joins-list-of-seven-presidents-with-harvard-degrees/ |archivedate=August 1, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was soon admitted to the bar, having completed his studies under Putnam.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=44}} He developed an early habit of writing about events and impressions of men in his diary; this included [[James Otis Jr.|James Otis Jr.'s]] 1761 legal argument challenging the legality of British [[Writ of assistance|Writs of Assistance]], allowing the British to search a home without notice or reason. Otis's argument inspired Adams to the cause of the American colonies.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=46}}

In 1763, Adams forged into various aspects of political theory by publishing seven essays in Boston newspapers. He offered them anonymously, under the [[nom de plume]] "Humphrey Ploughjogger", and in them ridiculed the selfish thirst for power he perceived among the Massachusetts colonial elite.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=36–39}} Adams was initially less well known than his older cousin [[Samuel Adams]], but his influence emerged from his work as a constitutional lawyer, his analysis of history, and his dedication to [[republicanism]]. Adams often found his irascible nature a constraint in his political career.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=16}}

In the late 1750s, Adams fell in love with Hannah Quincy; while they were alone, he was poised to propose, but was interrupted by friends, and the moment was lost. In 1759, he met 15-year-old [[Abigail Adams|Abigail Smith]] through his friend Richard Cranch, who was courting Abigail's older sister. Adams initially was not impressed with Abigail and her two sisters, writing that they were not "fond, nor frank, nor candid."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=51–52}} In time they grew close and were married on October 25, 1764, despite the opposition of Abigail's haughty mother. They shared a love of books, and kindred personalities that proved honest in their praise and criticism of each other. After his father's death in 1761, Adams had inherited a {{cvt|9+1/2|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm and [[John Quincy Adams Birthplace|a house]] where they lived until 1783.&lt;ref name=Life1961 /&gt;{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=55–56}} John and Abigail had six children: [[Abigail Adams Smith|Abigail]] "Nabby" in 1765,{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=58}} future president [[John Quincy Adams]] in 1767,{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=57}} Susanna in 1768, [[Charles Adams (1770–1800)|Charles]] in 1770, [[Thomas Boylston Adams (1772–1832)|Thomas]] in 1772,{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=71}} and Elizabeth in 1777.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=171–172}} Susanna died when she was one year old,{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=71}} while Elizabeth was stillborn.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=171–172}} All three of his sons became lawyers; Charles and Thomas were unsuccessful, became alcoholics, and died young, while John Quincy excelled and launched a career in politics. Adams' writings are devoid of his feelings about the sons' fates.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=634–35}}

==Career before the Revolution==

===Opponent of Stamp Act===
Adams rose to prominence leading widespread opposition to the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]]. The Act was imposed by the British Parliament without consulting the American legislatures. It required payment of a direct tax by the colonies for stamped documents,&lt;ref name="Declaration of Independence"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript |title=Declaration of Independence: A Transcription |publisher=United States National Archives |access-date=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stamp Act"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.john-adams-heritage.com/political-activism/|title=Stamp Act and the beginning of political activism |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614042234/http://www.john-adams-heritage.com/political-activism/ |publisher=John Adams Historical Society |archivedate=June 14, 2016|deadurl=no|accessdate=2016-07-05|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was designed to pay for the costs of Britain's war with France. Power of enforcement was given to British Vice Admiralty Courts, rather than [[common law]] courts.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=72–76}}&lt;ref name="Stamp Act"/&gt; These Admiralty courts acted without juries and were greatly disliked.&lt;ref name="Declaration of Independence"/&gt; The Act was despised for both its monetary cost and implementation without colonial consent, and encountered violent resistance, preventing its enforcement.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=72–76}} Adams authored the "[[Braintree Instructions]]" in 1765, in the form of a letter sent to the representatives of Braintree in the Massachusetts legislature. In it he explained that the Act should be opposed since it denied two fundamental rights guaranteed to all Englishmen (and which all free men deserved): rights to be taxed only by consent and to be tried by a jury of one's peers. The instructions were a succinct and forthright defense of colonial rights and liberties, and served as a model for other towns' instructions.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=55–56}}

Adams also reprised his pen name "Humphrey Ploughjogger" in opposition to the Stamp Act in August of that year. Included were four articles to the ''[[Boston Gazette]]''. The articles were republished in ''The London Chronicle'' in 1768 as ''True Sentiments of America'', also known as ''A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law''. He also spoke in December before the governor and council, pronouncing the Stamp Act invalid in the absence of Massachusetts representation at Parliament.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=39}}{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=59–61}} He noted that many protests were sparked by a popular sermon of Boston minister [[Jonathan Mayhew]], invoking [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans 13]] to justify insurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=905|title=Discourse Concerning Unlimited Submission and Non-resistance to the Higher Powers|first=Rev. Jonathan|last=Mayhew|publisher=Ashbrook Center|year=1750|accessdate=August 22, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415082838/http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=905|archivedate=April 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Adams took a strong stand against the Act in writing, he rebuffed attempts by Samuel Adams, a leader in the popular protest movements, to involve him in mob actions and public demonstrations.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=47–49}} In 1766, a town meeting of Braintree elected Adams as a selectman.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=63}}

With the repeal of the Stamp Act in early 1766, tensions with Britain temporarily eased.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=62–63}} Putting politics aside, Adams moved his family to Boston in April 1768 to focus on his law practice. The family rented a clapboard house on [[Brattle Street (Boston)|Brattle Street]] that was known locally as the "White House". He, Abigail, and the children lived there for a year, then moved to Cold Lane; still later, they moved again to a larger house in Brattle Square in the center of the city.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=57}} With the death of [[Jeremiah Gridley]] and mental collapse of Otis, Adams became Boston's most prominent lawyer.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=63}}

===Counsel for the British: Boston Massacre===
[[File:BostonMassacre byAlonzoChappel1878.png|thumb|Boston Massacre of 1770 by Alonzo Chappel (1878)|alt=Depiction of chaotic confrontation between British soldiers and Bostonians]]
Britain's passage of the [[Townshend Acts]] in 1767 revived tensions, and an increase in mob violence led the British to dispatch more troops to the colonies.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=57–59}} On March 5, 1770, when a lone British sentry was accosted by an mob of citizens, eight of his fellow [[29th (Worcestershire) Regiment of Foot|soldiers]] reinforced him, and the crowd around them grew to several hundred. The soldiers were struck with snowballs, ice, and stones, and in the chaos the soldiers opened fire, killing five civilians, bringing about the infamous [[Boston Massacre]]. The accused soldiers were arrested on charges of murder. When no other attorneys would come to their defense, Adams was impelled to do so despite the risk to his reputation—he believed no person should be denied the right to counsel and a fair trial. The trials were delayed so that passions could cool.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=65–66}}

The week-long trial of the commander, Captain [[Thomas Preston (British Army officer)|Thomas Preston]], began on October 24 and ended in his acquittal, because it was impossible to prove that he had ordered his soldiers to fire.{{sfn|Morse|1884|p=39}} The remaining soldiers were tried in December, when Adams made his legendary argument regarding jury decisions: "Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Adams |first=John |title=Argument in Defense of the Soldiers in the Boston Massacre Trials |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/05-03-02-0001-0004-0016 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |date=December 1770 |access-date=July 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added, "It is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished, for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished. But if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned, perhaps to die, then the citizen will say, 'whether I do good or whether I do evil is immaterial, for innocence itself is no protection,' and if such an idea as that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end of security whatsoever." Adams won acquittal for six of the soldiers. Two, who had fired directly into the crowd, were convicted of manslaughter. Adams was paid a small sum by his clients.&lt;ref name=Life1961&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=June 30, 1961 |title=Private Thoughts of a Founding Father |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V1QEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA82 |magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407141509/http://books.google.com/books?id=V1QEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA82 |archivedate=April 7, 2015 |access-date=June 7, 2015 |page=82 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to biographer [[John E. Ferling]], during [[Voir dire|jury selection]] Adams "expertly exercised his right to challenge individual jurors and contrived what amounted to a packed jury. Not only were several jurors closely tied through business arrangements to the British army, but five ultimately became Loyalist exiles." While Adams' defense was helped by a weak prosecution, he also "performed brilliantly."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=69}} Ferling surmises that Adams may have been encouraged to take the case in exchange for political office; one of Boston's seats opened three months later in the Massachusetts legislature, and Adams was the town's first choice to fill the vacancy.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=67–68}}

The prosperity of his law practice increased from this exposure, as did the demands on his time. In 1771, Adams moved his family to Braintree, but kept his office in Boston. He noted on the day of the family's move, "Now my family is away, I feel no Inclination at all, no Temptation, to be any where but at my Office. I am in it by 6 in the Morning – I am in it at 9 at night. ... In the Evening, I can be alone at my Office, and no where else." After some time in the capital, he became disenchanted with the rural and "vulgar" Braintree as a home for his family—in August 1772, he moved them back to Boston. He purchased a large brick house on [[Court Street (Boston)|Queen Street]], not far from his office.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=74}} In 1774, Adams and Abigail returned the family to the farm due to the increasingly unstable situation in Boston, and Braintree remained their permanent Massachusetts home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906091054/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/adams/peopleevents/p_callender.html |title=American Experience – John &amp; Abigail Adams – Timeline |publisher=PBS |access-date=September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Becoming a revolutionary===
Adams, who had been among the more conservative of the Founders, persistently held that while British actions against the colonies had been wrong and misguided, open insurrection was unwarranted and peaceful petition with the ultimate view of remaining part of Great Britain was a better alternative.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=72–73}} His ideas began to change around 1772, as the British Crown assumed payment of the salaries of Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] and his judges instead of the Massachusetts legislature. Adams wrote in the ''Gazette'' that these measures would destroy judicial independence and place the colonial government in closer subjugation to the Crown. After discontent among members of the legislature, Hutchinson delivered a speech warning that Parliament's powers over the colonies were absolute and that any resistance was illegal. Subsequently, John Adams, Samuel, and [[Joseph Hawley (Massachusetts)|Joseph Hawley]] drafted a resolution adopted by the House of Representatives threatening independence as an alternative to tyranny. The resolution argued that the colonists had never been under the sovereignty of Parliament. Their original charter, as well as their allegiance, was exclusively with the King.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=78–80}}

The [[Boston Tea Party]], a historic demonstration against the British [[East India Company]]'s tea monopoly over American merchants, took place on December 16, 1773. The British schooner ''Dartmouth'', loaded with tea to be traded subject to the new [[Tea Act]], had previously dropped anchor in Boston harbor. By 9:00 PM, the work of the protesters was done – they had demolished 342 chests of tea worth about ten thousand pounds, the 1992 equivalent of about $1 million. The ''Dartmouth'' owners briefly retained Adams as legal counsel regarding their liability for the destroyed shipment. Adams himself applauded the destruction of the tea, calling it the "grandest Event" in the history of the colonial protest movement,{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=92–94}} and writing in his diary that the dutied tea's destruction was an "absolutely and indispensably" necessary action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://founders.archives.gov/?q=absolutely%20and%20indispensably&amp;s=1511311111&amp;sa=&amp;r=2&amp;sr=|title=1773.

Five lay papers on a table.]]

In 1774, at the instigation of Samuel Adams, the [[First Continental Congress]] was convened in response to the [[Intolerable Acts]], a series of deeply unpopular measures intended to punish Massachusetts, centralize authority in Britain, and prevent rebellion in other colonies. Four delegates were chosen by the Massachusetts legislature, including Adams, who agreed to attend,{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=95–97}} despite an emotional plea from his friend [[Jonathan Sewall]] not to.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=71}}

Shortly after he arrived in Philadelphia, Adams was placed on the 23-member Grand Committee tasked with drafting a letter of grievances to [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. The members of the committee soon split into conservative and radical factions.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=107–108}} Although the Massachusetts delegation was largely passive, Adams criticized conservatives such as [[Joseph Galloway]], [[James Duane]], and [[Peter Oliver (loyalist)|Peter Oliver]] who advocated a conciliatory policy towards the British or felt that the colonies had a duty to remain loyal to Britain, although his views at the time did align with those of conservative [[John Dickinson (Pennsylvania and Delaware)|John Dickinson]]. Adams sought the repeal of objectionable policies, but at this early stage he continued to see benefits for maintaining America's status as a British colony.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=128–130}} He renewed his push for the right to a jury trial.&lt;ref&gt;Elrod, Jennifer. "W(h)ither the Jury? The Diminishing Role of the Jury Trial in Our Legal System," 68 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 3, 8 (2011) (quoting Thomas J. Methvin, Alabama – The Arbitration State, 62 Ala.

Adams' absence from home was hard on Abigail, who was left alone to care for the family. She still encouraged her husband in his task, writing: "You cannot be, I know, nor do I wish to see you an inactive Spectator, but if the Sword be drawn I bid adieu to all domestick felicity, and look forward to that Country where there is neither wars nor rumors of War in a firm belief that thro the mercy of its King we shall both rejoice there together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/04-01-02-0116 |title=Abigail Adams to John Adams, 16 October 1774 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News of the opening hostilities with the British at the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] made Adams hope that independence would soon become a reality. Three days after the battle, he rode into a militia camp and, while reflecting positively on the high spirits of the men, was distressed by their poor condition and lack of discipline.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|p=196}} A month later, Adams returned to Philadelphia for the [[Second Continental Congress]] as the leader of the Massachusetts delegation.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=87–88}} He moved cautiously at first, noting that the Congress was divided between [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]], those favoring independence, and those hesitant to take any position.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=90}} He became convinced that Congress was moving in the proper direction – away from Great Britain. Publicly, Adams supported "reconciliation if practicable," but privately agreed with [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s confidential observation that independence was inevitable.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=136}}

In June 1775, with a view of promoting union among the colonies against Great Britain, he nominated [[George Washington]] of Virginia as commander-in-chief of the [[Continental Army|army]] then assembled around Boston.&lt;ref name="Time Line"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://masshist.org/adams/timeline.cfm |title=Adams Time Line |publisher=Massachusetts Historical Society |accessdate=August 22, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324015852/http://masshist.org/adams/timeline.cfm |archivedate=March 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He praised Washington's "skill and experience" as well as his "excellent universal character."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=124}} Adams opposed various attempts, including the [[Olive Branch Petition]], aimed at trying to find peace between the colonies and Great Britain.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=94–95}} Invoking the already-long list of British actions against the colonies, he wrote, "In my opinion Powder and Artillery are the most efficacious, Sure, and infallibly conciliatory Measures We can adopt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/06-03-02-0014 |title=From John Adams to Moses Gill, 10 June 1775 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his failure to prevent the petition from being enacted, he wrote a private letter derisively referring to Dickinson as a "piddling genius." The letter was intercepted and published in Loyalist newspapers. The well-respected Dickinson refused to greet Adams and he was for a time largely ostracized.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=95–96}} Ferling writes, "By the fall of 1775 no one in Congress labored more ardently than Adams to hasten the day when America would be separate from Great Britain."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=136}} In October 1775, Adams was appointed the chief judge of the Massachusetts Superior Court, but he never served, and resigned in February 1777.&lt;ref name="Time Line"/&gt; In response to queries from other delegates, Adams wrote the 1776 pamphlet ''[[Thoughts on Government]]'', which laid out an influential framework for republican constitutions.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=155–157}}

===Independence===
Throughout the first half of 1776, Adams grew increasingly impatient with what he perceived to be the slow pace of declaring independence.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|p=263}} He kept busy on the floor of the Congress, helping push through a plan to outfit armed ships to launch raids on enemy vessels. Later in the year, he drafted the first set of regulations to govern the provisional navy.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=99–100}} Adams drafted the preamble to the [[Lee resolution]] of colleague [[Richard Henry Lee]].{{sfn|Maier|1998|p=37}} He developed a rapport with Delegate [[Thomas Jefferson]] of Virginia, who had been slower to support independence but by early 1776 agreed that it was necessary.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=113–117}} On June 7, 1776, Adams seconded the resolution, which stated, "These colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=146}}

Prior to independence being declared, Adams organized and selected a [[Committee of Five]] charged with drafting a Declaration of Independence. He chose himself, Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert R. Livingston]] and [[Roger Sherman]].{{sfn|Boyd|Gawalt|1999|p=21}} Jefferson thought Adams should write the document, but Adams persuaded the Committee to choose Jefferson. Adams recorded his exchange with Jefferson on the question: Jefferson asked, "Why will you not? You ought to do it." To which Adams responded, "I will not – reasons enough." Jefferson replied, "What can be your reasons?" And Adams responded, "Reason first, you are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear at the head of this business. Reason second, I am obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular. You are very much otherwise. Reason third, you can write ten times better than I can." "Well," said Jefferson, "if you are decided, I will do as well as I can."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=119}} The Committee left no minutes, and the drafting process itself remains uncertain. Accounts written many years later by Jefferson and Adams, although frequently cited, are often contradictory.{{sfn|Maier|1998|pp=97–105}} Although the first draft was written primarily by Jefferson, Adams assumed a major role in its completion.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=130–135}} On July 1, the resolution was debated in Congress. It was expected to pass, but opponents such as Dickinson made a strong effort to oppose it anyhow. Jefferson, a poor debater, remained silent while Adams argued for its adoption.{{sfn|Morse|1884|pp=127–128}} Many years later, Jefferson hailed Adams as "the pillar of [the Declaration's] support on the floor of Congress, [its] ablest advocate and defender against the multifarious assaults it encountered."&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, Thomas. To William P. Gardner. ''The Works of Thomas Jefferson''. Federal Edition (New York and London, G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1904–05). Vol. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; After editing [[United States Declaration of Independence|the document]] further, Congress approved it on July 2. Twelve colonies voted in the affirmative, while New York abstained. Dickinson was absent.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=136}} On July 3, Adams wrote to Abigail that "yesterday was decided the greatest question which was ever debated in America, and a greater perhaps never was nor will be decided among men." He predicted that "[t]he second day of July, 1776, will be the most memorable epoch in the history of America," and would be commemorated annually with great festivities.{{sfn|Morse|1884|p=128}}

After defeating the [[Continental Army]] at the [[Battle of Long Island]] on August 27, British Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] determined that a strategic advantage was at hand, and requested that Congress send representatives to negotiate peace. A delegation, including Adams and Benjamin Franklin, met with Howe at the [[Staten Island Peace Conference]] on September 11.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=153–157}} Howe's authority was premised on the states' submission, so the parties found no common ground. When Lord Howe stated he could only view the American delegates as British subjects, Adams replied, "Your lordship may consider me in what light you please, ... except that of a British subject."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=157}} Adams learned many years later that his name was on a list of people specifically excluded from Howe's pardon-granting authority.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=158}} Adams was unimpressed with Howe and predicted American success.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=164–65}}

In 1775, Adams became head of the [[Board of War and Ordnance]], charged with keeping accurate record of the officers in the army and their ranks, the disposition of troops throughout the colonies, and ammunition.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|p=267}} He sat on ninety committees, chairing twenty-five, an unmatched workload among the congressmen. As Benjamin Rush reported, he was acknowledged "to be the first man in the House."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=163}} He was referred to as a "one man war department," working up to eighteen-hour days and mastering the details of raising, equipping and fielding an army under civilian control. He authored the "Plan of Treaties," laying out the Congress's requirements for a treaty with France.{{sfn|Ellis|1993|pp=41–42}}

==Diplomatic service==
{{main|Diplomacy of John Adams}}

===Commissioner to France===
Before the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, Adams advocated in Congress that independence was necessary to establish trade, and conversely trade was essential for the attainment of independence; he specifically urged negotiation of a commercial treaty with France. He was then appointed, along with Franklin, Dickinson, [[Benjamin Harrison V|Benjamin Harrison]] of Virginia and Robert Morris of Pennsylvania, "to prepare a plan of treaties to be proposed to foreign powers." While Jefferson was laboring over the Declaration of Independence, Adams worked on the [[Model Treaty]]. The Model Treaty authorized a commercial agreement with France but contained no provisions for formal recognition or military assistance. There were provisions for what constituted French territory. The treaty adhered to the provision that "[[freedom of navigation|free ships make free goods]]," allowing neutral nations to trade reciprocally while exempting an agreed upon list of contraband. By late 1777, America's finances were in tatters, and that September a British army had [[Battle of Brandywine|defeated]] General Washington and captured Philadelphia. More Americans came to determine that mere commercial ties between the U.S. and France would not be enough, and that military assistance would be needed to end the war. The defeat of the British at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] was expected to help induce France to agree to an alliance.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=189–190}}

In November, Adams learned that he was to be named commissioner to France, replacing [[Silas Deane]] and joining Franklin and [[Arthur Lee (diplomat)|Arthur Lee]] in Paris to negotiate an alliance with the hesitant French. [[James Lovell (Continental Congress)|James Lovell]] invoked Adams' "inflexible integrity" and the need to have a youthful man who could counterbalance Franklin's advanced age. On November 27, Adams accepted, wasting no time. He wrote to Lovell that he "should have wanted no motives or arguments" for his acceptance if he "could be sure that the public would be benefited by it." Abigail was left in Massachusetts to manage their home, but it was agreed that 10-year-old John Quincy would go with Adams, for the experience was "of inestimable value" to his maturation.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=174–176}} On February 17, Adams set sail aboard the [[frigate]] ''[[USS Boston (1777)|Boston]]'', commanded by Captain [[Samuel Tucker]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=177–179}} The trip was stormy and treacherous. Lightning injured 19 sailors and killed one. The ship was pursued by several British vessels, with Adams taking up arms to help capture one. A cannon malfunction killed one and injured five of the crew.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=186}} On April 1, the ''Boston'' arrived in Spain, where Adams learned that France had agreed to an [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|alliance]] with the United States on February 6.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=187}} Shortly after, they arrived in France.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=189}} Adams was annoyed by the other two commissioners: Lee, whom he thought paranoid and cynical, and the popular and influential Franklin, whom he found lethargic and overly deferential and accommodating to the French.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=198, 209}} He assumed a less visible role but helped manage the delegation's finances and record-keeping.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=199}} Frustrated by the perceived lack of commitment on the part of the French, Adams wrote a letter to French foreign minister [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Vergennes]] in December, arguing for French naval support in North America. Franklin toned down the letter, but Vergennes still ignored it.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=210}} In September 1778, Congress increased Franklin's powers by naming him [[minister plenipotentiary]] to France while Lee was sent to Spain. Adams received no instructions. Frustrated by the apparent slight, he departed France with John Quincy on March 8, 1779.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=210–213}} On August 2, they arrived in Braintree.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=218}}

[[File:BenFranklinDuplessis.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Adams frequently clashed with [[Benjamin Franklin]] over how to manage French relations.]]
In late 1779, Adams was appointed as the sole minister charged with negotiations to establish a commercial treaty with Britain and end the war.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=221}} Following the conclusion of the Massachusetts constitutional convention, he departed for France in November{{sfn|Smith|1962a|p=451}} aboard the French frigate ''Sensible'' – accompanied by John Quincy and 9-year-old son Charles. Constant disagreement between Lee and Franklin eventually resulted in Adams assuming the role of tie-breaker in almost all votes on commission business. He increased his usefulness by mastering the French language. Lee was eventually recalled. Adams closely supervised his sons' education while writing to Abigail about once every ten days.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=218–222}}

In contrast to Franklin, Adams viewed the Franco-American alliance pessimistically. The French, he believed, were involved for their own self-interest, and he grew frustrated by what he saw as their sluggishness in providing substantial aid to the Revolution. The French, Adams wrote, meant to keep their hands "above our chin to prevent us from drowning, but not to lift our heads out of water."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=233}} In March 1780, Congress, trying to curb inflation, voted to devalue the dollar. Vergennes summoned Adams for a meeting. In a letter sent in June, he insisted that any fluctuation of the dollar value without an exception for French merchants was unacceptable and requested that Adams write to Congress asking it to "retrace its steps." Adams bluntly defended the decision, not only claiming that the French merchants were doing better than Vergennes implied, but voicing other grievances he had with the French. The alliance had been made over two years before. During that period, an army under the [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|comte de Rochambeau]] had been sent to assist Washington, but it had yet to do anything of significance and America was expecting French warships. These were needed, Adams wrote, to contain the British armies in the port cities and contend with the powerful British Navy. However, the French Navy had been sent not to the United States but to the West Indies to protect French interests there. France, Adams believed, needed to commit itself more fully to the alliance. Vergennes responded that he would deal only with Franklin, who sent a letter back to Congress critical of Adams.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=239–241}} Adams then left France of his own accord.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=242}}

===Ambassador to the Dutch Republic===
In mid-1780, Adams travelled to the [[Dutch Republic]]. One of the few other existing republics at the time, Adams thought it might be sympathetic to the American cause. Securing a Dutch loan could increase American independence from France and pressure Britain into peace. At first, Adams had no official status, but in July he was formally given permission to negotiate for a loan and took up residence in [[Amsterdam]] in August. Adams was originally optimistic and greatly enjoyed the city, but soon became disappointed. The Dutch, fearing British retaliation, refused to meet Adams. Before he had arrived, the British found out about secret aid the Dutch had sent to the Americans, the British authorized reprisals against their ships, which only increased their apprehension. Word had also reached Europe of American battlefield defeats. After five months of not meeting with a single Dutch official, Adams in early 1781 pronounced Amsterdam "the capital of the reign of [[Mammon]]."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=228–230}} He was finally invited to present his credentials as ambassador to the Dutch government at [[The Hague]] on April 19, 1781, but they did not promise any assistance. In the meantime, Adams thwarted an attempt by neutral European powers to mediate the war without consulting the United States.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=254–255}} In July, Adams consented to the departure of both of his sons; John Quincy went with Adams' secretary [[Francis Dana]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] as a [[French language|French]] interpreter, in an effort to seek recognition from [[Russia]], and a homesick Charles returned home with Adams' friend [[Benjamin Waterhouse]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=262}} In August, shortly after being removed from his position of sole head of peace treaty negotiations, Adams fell seriously ill in "a major nervous breakdown."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=236}} That November, he learned that American and French troops had decisively defeated the British at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]]. The victory was in large part due to the assistance of the French Navy, which vindicated Adams' stand for increased naval assistance.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=239–240}}

News of the American triumph at Yorktown convulsed Europe. In January 1782, after recovering, Adams arrived at The Hague to demand that the [[States General of the Netherlands]] answer his petitions. His efforts stalled, and he took his cause to the people, successfully capitalizing on popular pro-American sentiment to push the States General towards recognizing the U.S. Several provinces began recognizing American independence. On April 19, the States General in The Hague formally recognized American independence and acknowledged Adams as ambassador.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=268–270}} On June 11, with the aid of the Dutch [[Patriottentijd|''Patriotten'']] leader [[Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol]], Adams negotiated a loan of five million guilders. In October, he negotiated with the Dutch a treaty of amity and commerce.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=171–173}} The house that Adams bought during this stay in the [[Netherlands]] became the first American embassy on foreign soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehague.usembassy.gov/friendship_days2.html |title=Dutch American Friendship Day / Heritage Day – U.S. Embassy The Hague, Netherlands |publisher=U.S. Embassy |date=November 16, 1991 |accessdate=2010-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527103140/http://thehague.usembassy.gov/friendship_days2.html |archivedate=May 27, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treaty of Paris===
After negotiating the loan with the Dutch, Adams was re-appointed as the American commissioner to negotiate the war-ending treaty, the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. Vergennes still disapproved of Adams, so Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, [[John Jay]], and [[Henry Laurens]] were appointed to collaborate with Adams, although Jefferson did not go to Europe and Laurens was posted to the Dutch Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Ferling, ch. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final negotiations, securing fishing rights off [[Newfoundland]] and [[Cape Breton Island]] proved both very important and very difficult. In response to very strict restrictions proposed by the British, Adams insisted that not only should American fishermen be allowed to travel as close to shore as desired, but that they should be allowed to cure their fish on the shores of Newfoundland.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=545–546}} This, and other statements, prompted Vergennes to secretly inform the British that France did not feel compelled to "sustain [these] pretentious ambitions." Overruling Franklin and distrustful of Vergennes, Jay and Adams decided not to consult with France, instead dealing directly with the British.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=281–284}} During these negotiations, Adams mentioned to the British that his proposed fishing terms were more generous than those offered by France in 1778, and that accepting would foster good will between Britain and the United States while putting pressure on France. Britain agreed, and the two sides worked out other provisions afterwards. Vergennes was angered when he learned from Franklin of the American duplicity, but did not demand renegotiation,{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=546–547}} and was supposedly surprised at how much the Americans could extract. The independent negotiations allowed the French to plead innocence to their Spanish allies, whose demands for [[Gibraltar]] might have caused significant problems.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=546–547}} On September 3, 1783, the treaty was signed and American independence was recognized.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=285}}

===Ambassador to Great Britain===
[[File:John Adams (1785) Age 50.jpg|thumb|Portrait by Mather Brown|right|Adams – 1785 [[Mather Brown]] Portrait]]
Adams was appointed the first American ambassador to Great Britain in 1785. When a counterpart assumed that Adams had family in England, Adams replied, "Neither my father or mother, grandfather or grandmother, great grandfather or great grandmother, nor any other relation that I know of, or care a farthing for, has been in England these one hundred and fifty years; so that you see I have not one drop of blood in my veins but what is American."{{sfn|Adams|Adams|1851|p=392}}

After arriving in London from Paris, Adams had his first audience with King George III on June 1, which he meticulously recorded in a letter to Foreign Minister Jay the next day. The pair's exchange was respectful; Adams promised to do all that he could to restore friendship and cordiality "between People who, tho Seperated [sic] by an Ocean and under different Governments have the Same Language, a Similar Religion and kindred Blood," and the King agreed to "receive with Pleasure, the Assurances of the friendly Dispositions of the United States." The King added that although "he had been the last to consent" to American independence, he wanted Adams to know that he had always done what he thought was right. Towards its end, he startled Adams by commenting that "There is an Opinion, among Some People, that you are not the most attached of all Your Countrymen, to the manners of France." Adams replied, "That Opinion sir, is not mistaken, I must avow to your Majesty, I have no Attachments but to my own Country." To this King George responded, "An honest Man will never have any other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/06-17-02-0078#ADMS-06-17-02-0078-fn-0013 |title=From John Adams to John Jay, 2 June 1785 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams was joined by Abigail while in London. Suffering the hostility of the King's courtiers, they escaped when they could by seeking out [[Richard Price]], minister of [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]] and instigator of the [[Revolution Controversy|debate over the Revolution]] within Britain.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=343–344}} Adams corresponded with his sons John Quincy and Charles, both of whom were at Harvard, cautioning the former against the "smell of the midnight lamp" while admonishing the latter to devote sufficient time to study.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=364–365}} Jefferson visited Adams in 1786 while serving as Minister to France; the two toured the countryside and saw many British historical sites.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=354–357}} While in London, he briefly met his old friend Jonathan Sewall, but the two discovered that they had grown too far apart to renew their friendship. Adams considered Sewall one of the war's casualties, and Sewall critiqued him as an ambassador:

{{quote|His abilities are undoubtedly equal to the mechanical parts of his business as ambassador; but this is not enough. He cannot dance, drink, game, flatter, promise, dress, swear with the gentlemen, and small talk and flirt with the ladies; in short, he has none of those essential arts or ornaments which constitute a courtier. There are thousands who, with a tenth of his understanding and without a spark of his honesty, would distance him infinitely in any court in Europe.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=348–350}}}}

Adams' tenure in Britain was complicated by both countries failing to follow their treaty obligations. The American states had been delinquent in paying debts owed to British merchants, and in response, the British refused to vacate forts in the northwest as promised. Adams' attempts to resolve this dispute failed, and he was often frustrated by a lack of news of progress from home.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=655}} The news he received of tumult at home, such as [[Shays' Rebellion]], heightened his anxiety. He then asked Jay to be relieved;{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=702}} in 1788, he took his leave of George III, who engaged Adams in polite and formal conversation, promising to uphold his end of the treaty once America did the same.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=729}} Adams then went to The Hague to take formal leave of his ambassadorship there and to secure refinancing from the Dutch, allowing the United States to meet obligations on earlier loans.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=382}}

==Vice Presidency, 1789–97==
===Election===
On June 17, Adams arrived back in Massachusetts to a triumphant welcome. He returned to farming life in the months after. The nation's first [[U.S. presidential election, 1789|presidential election]] was soon to take place. Because George Washington was widely expected to win the presidency, many felt that the vice presidency should go a northerner. Although he made no public comments on the matter, Adams was the primary contender.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=389–392}} Each state's [[Electoral College (United States)|presidential electors]] gathered on February 4, 1789 to cast their two votes for the president. The person with the most votes would be president and the second would become vice president.{{sfn|Ferling|2009|pp=270–274}} Adams received 34 [[United States Electoral College|electoral college]] votes in the election, second place behind George Washington, who garnered 69 votes. As a result, Washington became the nation's [[List of Presidents of the United States|first president]], and Adams became its first [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|vice president]]. Adams finished well ahead of all others except Washington, but was still offended by Washington receiving more than twice as many votes.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=393–394}} To Benjamin Rush, he wrote, "Is not my election to this office, in the dark and scurvy manner in which it was done, a curse rather than a blessing?" Unbeknownst to Adams, Hamilton convinced many electors to not vote for him, under the pretext of not embarrassing Washington, to be absolutely sure that Adams did not win.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=272–273}}

Although his term was scheduled to start on March 4, 1789, it was delayed until April 21 because Congress could not initially achieve a [[quorum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Vice Presidential Inaugurations| url=https://www.aoc.gov/nations-stage/vice-president-inaugurations |publisher=Architect of the Capitol| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure===
[[File:Official Presidential portrait of John Adams (by John Trumbull, circa 1792).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Portrait of Adams by [[John Trumbull]], 1793]]
The sole constitutionally prescribed responsibility of the vice president is to preside over the Senate, where he can cast a tie-breaking vote.&lt;ref name="USSadamsdoc"&gt;{{Include-USGov| agency= United States Senate| article= Vice President of the United States (President of the Senate)| url= https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Vice_President.htm#2| accessdate= July 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his term, Adams became deeply involved in a lengthy Senate controversy over the official titles for the president and executive officers of the new government. Although the House agreed that the president should be addressed simply as "George Washington, President of the United States," the Senate debated the issue at some length. Adams favored the adoption of the style of ''Highness'' (as well as the title of ''Protector of Their [the United States'] Liberties'') for the president.{{sfn|Hutson|1968|pp=30–39}} Some senators favored a variant of ''Highness'' or the lesser ''Excellency''."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=404–405}} [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-federalists]] in the Senate objected to the monarchical sound of them all; Jefferson described them as "superlatively ridiculous."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=410}} The Senate emphasized simplicity and republicanism, and many argued that these "distinctions," as Adams called them, violated the Constitution's prohibition on titles of nobility. Adams argued that the distinctions were necessary because the highest office of the United States must be marked with "dignity and splendor" to command respect. He was widely derided for his combative nature and stubbornness, especially as he actively debated and lectured the senators. "For forty minutes he harangued us from the chair," wrote Senator [[William Maclay (Pennsylvania senator)|William Maclay]] of Pennsylvania. Maclay became Adams' fiercest opponent and repeatedly expressed personal contempt for him in both public and private. He likened Adams to "a monkey just put into breeches."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=406–408}} [[Ralph Izard]] suggested that Adams be referred to by the title "His Rotundity," a joke which soon became popular.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=408}} On May 14, the Senate decided that the title of "[[Mr. President (title)|Mr. President]]" would be used.{{sfn|Wood|2006|p=54}} Privately, Adams conceded that his vice presidency had begun poorly, and that perhaps he had been out of the country too long to know the sentiment of the people. Washington quietly expressed his displeasure with the fuss and rarely consulted Adams.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=408–409}}

[[File:George_Washington_1795.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Portrait of Washington by [[Gilbert Stuart]], 1795.  George Washington rarely consulted Vice President Adams, who often felt marginalized and overshadowed by Washington's prestige.]]
As vice president, Adams largely sided with the Washington administration and the emerging [[Federalist Party]]. He supported Washington's policies against opposition from anti-Federalists and [[Democratic-Republican Party|Republicans]]. He cast 31 [[List of tie-breaking votes cast by vice presidents of the United States|tie-breaking votes]], all in support of the administration, and more than any other vice president.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=460}} In 1790, Jefferson, Madison, and Hamilton struck a [[Compromise of 1790|bargain]] guaranteeing Republican support for Hamilton's [[Funding Act of 1790|debt assumption plan]] in exchange for the capital being temporarily moved from New York to [[Philadelphia]], and then to a permanent site on the [[Potomac River]] to placate Southerners. In the Senate, Adams cast a tie-breaking nay vote against a last-minute motion to keep the capital in New York.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=425–426}} In another instance, he voted against a bill sponsored by Maclay that would have required Senate consent for the removal of executive branch officials who had been confirmed by the Senate.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=413–414}}

Adams played a minor role in politics as vice president. He attended few cabinet meetings, and the President sought his counsel infrequently.&lt;ref name=USSadamsdoc/&gt; While Adams brought energy and dedication to the office,{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=769}} by mid-1789 he had already found it "not quite adapted to my character ... too inactive, and mechanical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/?q=%22not%20quite%20adapted%20to%20my%20character%22&amp;s=1511311111&amp;sa=&amp;r=1&amp;sr= |title=John Adams to John Quincy Adams, 9 July 1789 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote, "My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man ... or his imagination contrived or his imagination conceived."{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=844}} Adams' behavior made him a target for critics of the Washington administration. Toward the end of his first term, he grew accustomed to assuming a marginal role, and rarely intervened in debate.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=434}} Adams never questioned Washington's courage or patriotism, but Washington did join Franklin and others as the object of Adams' ire or envy. "The History of our Revolution will be one continued lie," Adams declared. "...&amp;nbsp;The essence of the whole will be that Dr. Franklin's electrical Rod smote the Earth and out sprung General Washington. That Franklin electrified him with his Rod – and henceforth these two conducted all the Policy, Negotiations, Legislatures and War."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=310}} Adams won reelection with little difficulty in [[United States presidential election, 1792|1792]] with 77 votes. His strongest challenger, [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]], had 50.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=439}}

On July 14, 1789, the [[French Revolution]] began. Republicans were jubilant. Adams at first expressed cautious optimism, but soon began denouncing the revolutionaries as barbarous and tyrannical.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=416–417}} Washington eventually consulted Adams more often, but not until near the end of his administration, by which point Hamilton, Jefferson, and [[Edmund Randolph]] had all resigned.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=878}} The British had been raiding American trading vessels, and John Jay was sent to London to negotiate an end to hostilities. When he returned with a [[Jay Treaty|peace treaty]] on terms unfavorable to the United States, Adams urged Washington to sign it to prevent war. Washington chose to do so, igniting protests and riots. He was accused of surrendering American honor to a tyrannical monarchy and of turning his back on the French Republic.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=456–457}} John Adams predicted in a letter to Abigail that ratification would deeply divide the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/04-11-02-0132 |title=John Adams to Abigail Adams, 16 April 1796 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Election of 1796===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1796}}
[[File:ElectoralCollege1796.svg|thumb|250px|1796 presidential election results]]
The election of 1796 was the first contested American presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bomboy |first=Scott |title=Inside America's first dirty presidential campaign, 1796 style |work=Constitution Daily |date=October 22, 2012 |url=https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/inside-americas-first-dirty-presidential-campaign-1796-style/ |publisher=National Constitution Center |location=Philadelphia, PA |access-date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twice, George Washington had been elected to office unanimously but, during his [[presidency of George Washington|presidency]], deep philosophical differences between the two leading figures in the administration – Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson – had caused a rift, leading to the founding of the Federalist Party and Republican parties.&lt;ref name=FerlingTime&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/4210440/jefferson-hamilton-excerpt/ |title=How the Rivalry Between Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton Changed History |first=John |last=Ferling |publisher=''Time Magazine'' |date=February 15, 2016 |access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Washington announced that he would not be a candidate for a third term, an intense [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] struggle for control of Congress and the presidency began.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|pp=360–361}}

Like the previous two presidential elections, no candidates were put forward for voters to choose between in 1796. The Constitution provided for the selection of electors who would then choose a president.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|pp=898–99}} In seven states voters chose the presidential electors. In the remaining nine states, they were chosen by the state's legislature.&lt;ref name=JAelections&gt;{{cite web |url=https://millercenter.org/president/adams/campaigns-and-elections |title=John Adams: Campaigns and Elections |last=Taylor |first=C. James |publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia |location=Charlottesville, VA |access-date=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clear Republican favorite was Jefferson.{{sfn|McDonald|1974|pp=178–181}} Adams was the Federalist frontrunner.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|pp=898–899}} The Republicans held a [[congressional nominating caucus]] and named Jefferson and [[Aaron Burr]] as their presidential choices.{{sfn|Diggins|2003|pp=83–88}} Jefferson at first declined the nomination, but he agreed to run a few weeks later. Federalist members of Congress held an informal nominating caucus and named Adams and [[Thomas Pinckney]] as their candidates.{{sfn|McDonald|1974|pp=178–181}}{{sfn|Hoadley|1986|p=54}} The campaign was for the most part confined to newspaper attacks, pamphlets and political rallies;{{sfn|Smith|1962b|pp=898–899}} of the four contenders, only Burr actively campaigned. The practice of not campaigning for office would remain for many decades.&lt;ref name=JAelections/&gt; Adams stated that he wanted to stay out of what he called the "silly and wicked game" of electioneering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/?q=silly%20and%20wicked%20game%20Author%3A%22Adams%2C%20John%22&amp;s=1511311111&amp;sa=&amp;r=1&amp;sr= |title=John Adams to Abigail Adams, 10 February 1796 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the campaign progressed, fears grew among Hamilton and his supporters that Adams was too vain, opinionated, unpredictable and stubborn to follow their directions.{{sfn|Elkins|McKitrick|1993|pp=513–537}} Indeed, Adams felt largely left out of Washington's administration and did not consider himself a strong member of the Federalist Party. He had remarked that Hamilton's economic program, centered around banks, would "swindle" the poor and unleash the "gangrene of avarice."{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=521}} Desiring "a more pliant president than Adams," Hamilton maneuvered to tip the election to Pinckney. He coerced South Carolina Federalist electors, pledged to vote for "[[favorite son]]" Pinckney, to scatter their second votes among candidates other than Adams. Hamilton's scheme was undone when several [[New England]] state electors heard of it and agreed not to vote for Pinckney.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=902}} Adams wrote shortly after the election that Hamilton was a "proud Spirited, conceited, aspiring Mortal always pretending to Morality, with as debauched Morals as old Franklin who is more his Model than any one I know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/04-11-02-0251 |title=John Adams to Abigail Adams, 9 January 1797 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=September 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his life, Adams made highly critical statements about Hamilton. He made derogatory references to his womanizing, real or alleged, and slurred him as the "[[Creole peoples|Creole]] bastard."{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=522}}

In the end, Adams won the presidency by a narrow margin, receiving 71 electoral votes to 68 for Jefferson, who became the vice president; Pinckney finished in third with 59 votes, and Burr came in fourth with 30. The balance of the Electoral College votes were dispersed among nine other candidates.&lt;ref name=ECscore&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/scores.html#1789| title=Electoral College Box Scores 1789–1996| publisher=[[Office of the Federal Register]], [[National Archives and Records Administration]]| location=College Park, Maryland| accessdate=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the only election to date in which a president and vice president were elected from opposing tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-oe-amar22-2008oct22-story.html |title=Vice president: a split-ticket vote? |last=Amar |first=Vikram David |date=October 22, 2008 |publisher=''The New York Times'' |access-date=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidency, 1797–1801==
{{Main|Presidency of John Adams}}
[[File:PhiladelphiaPresidentsHouse.jpg|thumb|[[President's House (Philadelphia)|President's House]], [[Philadelphia]]. Adams occupied this Philadelphia mansion from March 1797 to May 1800.]]

===Inauguration===
Adams was [[Inauguration of John Adams|sworn into office]] as the nation's second president on March 4, 1797 by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Oliver Ellsworth]]. As president, he followed Washington's lead in using the presidency to exemplify republican values and [[civic virtue]], and his service was free of scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 3rd Presidential Inauguration, John Adams, March 04, 1797| url=https://www.inaugural.senate.gov/about/past-inaugural-ceremonies/3rd-inaugural-ceremonies/| publisher=U.S. Senate| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams spent much of his term at his Massachusetts home [[Peacefield]], preferring the quietness of domestic life to business at the capital. He ignored the political patronage and office seekers which other office holders utilized.{{sfn|Herring|2008|p=91}}

Historians debate his decision to retain the members of Washington's cabinet in light of the cabinet's loyalty to Hamilton. The "Hamiltonians who surround him," Jefferson soon remarked, "are only a little less hostile to him than to me."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=333}} Although aware of Hamilton's influence, Adams was convinced that their retention ensured a smoother succession.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=471}} Adams maintained the economic programs of Hamilton, who regularly consulted with key cabinet members, especially the powerful Treasury Secretary, [[Oliver Wolcott Jr.]]{{sfn|Kurtz|1957|p=272}} Adams was in other respects quite independent of his cabinet, often making decisions despite opposition from it.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=593–594}} Hamilton had grown accustomed to being regularly consulted by Washington. Shortly after Adams was inaugurated, Hamilton sent him a detailed letter filled with policy suggestions for the new administration. Adams dismissively ignored it.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=524}}

===Failed peace commission and XYZ affair===
{{Main|XYZ Affair}}
[[File:Property protected à la françoise.jpg|thumb|right|A political cartoon depicts the XYZ Affair – America is a female being plundered by Frenchmen. (1798)]]
Historian [[Joseph Ellis]] writes that "[t]he Adams presidency was destined to be dominated by a single question of American policy to an extent seldom if ever encountered by any succeeding occupant of the office." That question was whether to make war with France or find peace.{{sfn|Ellis|1993|p=28}} In Europe, [[French Revolutionary Wars|Britain and France were at war]] as a result of the French Revolution. Hamilton and the Federalists favored the British monarchy against what they perceived to be the political and anti-religious radicalism of the French Revolution, while Jefferson and the Republicans, with their firm opposition to monarchy, strongly supported France.{{sfn|Wood|2009|pp=174–177; 240}} The French had supported Jefferson for president and became even more belligerent at his loss.{{sfn|Herring|2008|p=82}} When Adams entered office, he decided to continue Washington's policy of staying out of the war. Because of the Jay Treaty, the French saw America as Britain's junior partner and began seizing American merchant ships that were trading with the British. Most Americans were still pro-French due to France's assistance during the Revolution, the perceived humiliation of the Jay Treaty, and their desire to support a republic against the British monarchy, and would not tolerate war with France.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=343–345}}

On May 16, 1797, Adams gave a speech to the House and Senate in which he called for increasing defense capabilities in case of war with France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/ja97-03.asp |title=John Adams – Special Message to the Senate and the House; May 16 1797 |publisher=''Avalon Project,'' Yale Law School |access-date=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced that he would send a peace commission to France but simultaneously called for a military buildup to counter any potential French threat. The speech was well received by the Federalists. Adams was depicted as an eagle holding an olive branch in one talon and the "emblems of defense" in the other. The Republicans were outraged, for Adams had not only failed to express support for the cause of the French Republic but appeared to be calling for war against it.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=484–485}}

Sentiments changed with the [[XYZ Affair]]. The peace commission that Adams appointed consisted of [[John Marshall]], [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] and [[Elbridge Gerry]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=495}} Jefferson met four times with Joseph Letombe, the French consul in Philadelphia. Letombe wrote to Paris stating that Jefferson had told him that it was in France's best interest to treat the American ministers civilly but "then drag out the negotiations at length" to arrive at most favorable solution. According to Letombe, Jefferson called Adams "vain, suspicious, and stubborn."{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=547}} When the envoys arrived in October, they were kept waiting for several days, and then granted only a 15-minute meeting with French Foreign Minister [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]]. The diplomats were then met by three of Talleyrand's agents. The French emissaries (later code-named, X, Y, and Z) refused to conduct negotiations unless the United States paid enormous bribes, one to Talleyrand personally, and another to the Republic of France.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=495}} Supposedly this was to make up for offenses given to France by Adams in his speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/?q=talleyrand%20Author%3A%22Adams%2C%20John%22&amp;s=1511311111&amp;r=4 |title=Epitomy, and Remarks on Actions of Ministers at Paris, 22 October 1797 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Americans refused to negotiate on such terms.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=495–496}} Marshall and Pinckney returned home, while Gerry remained.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=502}}

News of the disastrous peace mission arrived in the form of a memorandum from Marshall on March 4, 1798. Adams, not wanting to incite violent impulses among the populace, announced that the mission had failed without providing details.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=550}} He also sent a message to Congress asking for a renewal of the nation's defenses. The Republicans frustrated the President's defense measures. Suspecting that he might be hiding material favorable to France, the House, with the support of Federalists who had heard rumors of what was contained in the messages and were happy to assist the Republicans, voted overwhelmingly to demand that Adams release the papers. Once they were released, the Republicans, according to Abigail, were "struck dumb."{{sfn|Smith|1962b|pp=957–960}} [[Benjamin Franklin Bache]], editor of the ''[[Philadelphia Aurora]],'' blamed Adams' aggression as the cause of the disaster. Among the general public, the effects were very different. The affair substantially weakened popular American support of France. Adams reached the height of his popularity as many in the country called for full-scale war against the French.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=498}}

===Alien and Sedition Acts===
{{Main|Alien and Sedition Acts}}
Despite the XYZ Affair, Republican opposition persisted. Federalists accused the French and their associated immigrants of provoking civil unrest. In an attempt to quell the outcry, the Federalists introduced, and the Congress passed, a series of laws collectively referred to as the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], which were signed by Adams in June 1798.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=365–368}} Congress specifically passed four measures – the [[Naturalization Act of 1798|Naturalization Act]], the Alien Friends Act, the Alien Enemies Act and the Sedition Act. All came within a period of two weeks, in what Jefferson called an "unguarded passion." The Alien Friends Act, Alien Enemies Act, and Naturalization Acts targeted immigrants, specifically French, by giving the President greater deportation authority and increasing citizenship requirements. The Sedition Act made it a crime to publish "false, scandalous, and malicious writing" against the government or its officials.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=365}} Adams had not promoted any of these acts, but was urged to sign them by his wife and cabinet. He eventually agreed and signed the bills into law.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=366}}

[[File:Thomas Jefferson rev.jpg|thumb|right|Thomas Jefferson, Adams' Vice President, attempted to undermine many of his actions as president and eventually defeated him for reelection.]]
The administration initiated fourteen or more indictments under the Sedition Act, as well as suits against five of the six most prominent Republican newspapers. The majority of the legal actions began in 1798 and 1799, and went to trial on the eve of the 1800 presidential election. Other historians have cited evidence that the Alien and Sedition Acts were rarely enforced, namely: 1) only 10 convictions under the Sedition Act have been identified; 2) Adams never signed a deportation order; and 3) the sources of expressed furor over the acts were Republicans. The Acts allowed for prosecution of many who opposed the Federalists.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=668}} Congressman [[Matthew Lyon]] of Vermont was sentenced to four months in jail for criticizing the President.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=575}} Adams resisted Pickering's attempts to deport aliens, although many left on their own, largely in response to the hostile environment.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=367}} Republicans were outraged. Jefferson, disgusted by the acts, wrote nothing publicly but partnered with Madison to secretly draft the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]]. Jefferson, writing for Kentucky, wrote that states had the "natural right" to [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullify]] any acts they deemed unconstitutional. Writing to Madison, he speculated that as a last resort the states might have to "sever ourselves from the union we so much value."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=520–521}} Federalists reacted bitterly to the resolutions, which were to have far more lasting implications for the country than the Alien and Sedition Acts. Still, the acts Adams signed into law energized and unified the Republican Party while doing little to unite the Federalists.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=573–575}}

===Quasi-War===
In May 1798, a French privateer captured a merchant vessel off of the New York Harbor. An increase in attacks on sea marked the beginning of the undeclared naval war known as the [[Quasi-War]].{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=553}} Adams knew that America would be unable to win a major conflict, both because of its internal divisions and because France at the time was dominating the fight in most of Europe. He pursued a strategy whereby America harassed French ships in an effort sufficient to stem the French assaults on American interests.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=356–357}} In May, shortly after the attack in New York, Congress created a separate Navy Department. The prospect of a French invasion of the U.S. mainland led for calls to build up the army. Hamilton and other "High Federalists" were particularly adamant that a large army be called up, in spite of a common fear, particularly among Republicans, that large standing armies were subversive to liberty. In May, a "provisional" army of 10,000 soldiers was authorized by Congress. In July, Congress created twelve infantry regiments and provided for six cavalry companies. These numbers exceeded Adams' requests but fell short of Hamilton's.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=552–553}}

Adams was pressured by Federalists to appoint Hamilton, who had served as Washington's aide-de-camp during the Revolution, to command the army.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|p=376}} Distrustful of Hamilton and fearing a plot to subvert his administration, Adams appointed Washington to command the army without consulting him. Washington was surprised, and as a condition of his acceptance demanded that he be permitted to appoint his own subordinates. He wished to have [[Henry Knox]] as second-in-command, followed by Hamilton, and then Charles Pinckney.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|pp=376–377}} On June 2, Hamilton wrote to Washington stating that he would not serve unless he was made Inspector General and second-in-command.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=555}} Washington conceded that Hamilton, despite holding a rank lower than that of Knox and Pinckney, had, by serving on his staff, more opportunity to comprehend the whole military scene, and should therefore outrank them. Adams sent Secretary of War McHenry to [[Mount Vernon]] to convince Washington to accept the post. McHenry put forth his opinion that Washington would not serve unless permitted to choose his own officers.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|p=378}} Adams had intended to appoint Republicans Burr and [[Frederick Muhlenberg]] to make the army appear bipartisan. Washington's list consisted entirely of Federalists.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=978}} Adams relented and agreed to submit to the Senate the names of Hamilton, Pinckney, and Knox, in that order, although final decisions of rank would be reserved to Adams.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|p=378}} Knox refused to serve under these conditions. Adams firmly intended to give to Hamilton the lowest possible rank, while Washington and many other Federalists wrongly insisted that the order in which the names had been submitted to the Senate must determine seniority. On September 21, Adams received a letter from McHenry relaying a statement from Washington threatening to resign if Hamilton were not made second-in-command.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|pp=380–381}} Adams knew of the backlash that he would receive from Federalists should he continue his course, and he was forced to capitulate despite bitter resentment against many of his fellow Federalists.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|pp=982–983}} The severe illness of Abigail, whom Adams was feared was near death, exacerbated his suffering and frustration.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|pp=380–381}}

[[File:Alexander Hamilton portrait by John Trumbull 1806.jpg|thumb|left|Alexander Hamilton's desire for high military rank and his push for war with France put him into conflict with Adams.]]
It quickly became apparent that due to Washington's advanced age, Hamilton was the army's ''de facto'' commander. He exerted effective control over the War Department, taking over supplies for the army.{{sfn|Kurtz|1957|p=331}} Meanwhile, Adams built up the Navy, adding [[six original United States frigates|six fast, powerful frigates]], most notably the [[USS Constitution|USS ''Constitution'']].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=507}}

The Quasi-War continued, but there was a noticeable decline in war fever beginning in the fall once news arrived of the French defeat at the [[Battle of the Nile]], which many Americans hoped would make them more disposed to negotiate.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=516–517}} In October, Adams heard from Gerry in Paris that the French wanted to make peace and would properly receive an American delegation. That December in his address to Congress, Adams relayed these statements while expressing the need to maintain adequate defenses. The speech angered both Federalists, including Hamilton, many of whom had wanted a request for a declaration of war, and Republicans.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=592–593}} Hamilton secretly promoted a plan, already rejected by Adams, in which American and British troops would combine to seize [[Spanish Florida]] and [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]], ostensibly to deter a possible French invasion. Hamilton's critics, including Abigail, saw in his military buildups the signs of an aspiring military dictator.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=518}}

On February 18, 1799, Adams surprised many by nominating diplomat [[William Vans Murray]] on a peace mission to France. The decision was made without consulting his cabinet or even Abigail, who nonetheless upon hearing of it described it as a "master stroke." To placate Republicans, he nominated [[Patrick Henry]] and Ellsworth to accompany Murray and the Senate immediately approved them on March 3. Henry declined the nomination and Adams chose [[William Richardson Davie]] to replace him.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=523–525}} Hamilton strongly criticized the decision, as did Adams' cabinet members, who maintained frequent communication with him. Adams again questioned the loyalty of those men but did not remove them.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=593–594}} To the annoyance of many, Adams spent a full seven months–March to September–of 1799 in Peacefield, finally returning to Trenton, where the government had set up temporary quarters due to the [[yellow fever]] epidemic, after a letter arrived from Talleyrand confirming Gerry's statement that American ministers would be received. Adams then decided to send the commissioners to France.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=526–529}} Adams arrived back in Trenton on October 10.{{sfn|Morse|1884|p=304}} Shortly after, Hamilton, in a breach of military protocol, arrived uninvited at the city to speak with the President, urging him not to send the peace commissioners but instead to ally with Britain, which he viewed to be the stronger party, to restore the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] to France. "I heard him with perfect good humor, though never in my life did I hear a man talk more like a fool," Adams said. He regarded Hamilton's idea as chimerical and far-fetched. On November 15, the commissioners set sail for Paris.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=530–531}}

===Fries's Rebellion===
{{main|Fries's Rebellion}}
To pay for the military buildup of the Quasi-War, Adams and his Federalist allies enacted the [[direct tax|Direct Tax]] of 1798. Direct taxation by the federal government was widely unpopular, and the government's revenue under Washington had mostly come from [[excise tax]]es and [[Tariffs in United States history|tariffs]]. Though Washington had maintained a balanced budget with the help of a growing economy, increased military expenditures threatened to cause major budget deficits, and the Federalists developed a taxation plan to meet the need for increased government revenue. The Direct Tax of 1798 instituted a [[progressive tax|progressive]] [[land value tax]] of up to 1% of the value of a property. Taxpayers in eastern Pennsylvania resisted federal tax collectors, and in March 1799 the bloodless Fries's Rebellion broke out. Led by Revolutionary War veteran [[John Fries]], rural German-speaking farmers protested what they saw as a threat to their liberties. They intimidated tax collectors, who often found themselves unable to go about their business.{{sfn|Elkins|McKitrick|1993|pp=696–700}} The disturbance was quickly ended with Hamilton leading the army to restore peace.{{sfn|Diggins|2003|pp=129–130}}

Fries and two other leaders were arrested, found guilty of treason, and sentenced to hang. They appealed to Adams requesting a pardon. The cabinet unanimously advised Adams to refuse, but he instead granted the pardon, using as justification the argument that the men had instigated a mere riot as opposed to a rebellion.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=540–541}} In his pamphlet attacking Adams before the election, Hamilton wrote that "it was impossible to commit a greater error."&lt;ref name="Adams Pamphlet"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-25-02-0110-0002#ARHN-01-25-02-0110-0002-fn-0166-ptr |title=Letter from Alexander Hamilton, Concerning the Public Conduct and Character of John Adams, Esq.

On May 5, 1800, Adams' frustrations with the Hamilton wing of the party exploded during a meeting with McHenry, a Hamilton loyalist who was universally regarded, even by Hamilton, as an inept Secretary of War. Adams accused him of subservience to Hamilton and declared that he would rather serve as Jefferson's vice president or minister at The Hague than be beholden to Hamilton for the presidency. McHenry offered to resign at once, and Adams accepted. On May 10, he asked Pickering to resign. Pickering refused and was summarily dismissed. Adams named John Marshall as Secretary of State and [[Samuel Dexter]] as Secretary of War.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=538–539}}{{sfn|Smith|1962b|pp=1028–1029}} In 1799, [[Napoleon]] took over as head of the French government in the [[Coup of 18 Brumaire]] and declared the French Revolution over.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=534}} News of this event increased Adams' desire to disband the provisional army, which, with Washington now dead, was commanded only by Hamilton.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=539–540}} His moves to end the army after the departures of McHenry and Pickering were met with little opposition.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=395}} Rather than allow Adams to receive the credit, Federalists joined with Republicans in voting to disband the army in mid-1800.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=539–540}}

Napoleon, realizing that the conflict was pointless, signaled his readiness for friendly relations. By the [[Convention of 1800]], the two sides agreed to return any captured ships and to allow for the peaceful transfer of non-military goods to an enemy of the nation. On January 23, 1801, the Senate voted 16–14 in favor of the treaty, four votes short of the necessary two thirds. Some Federalists, including Hamilton, urged that the Senate vote in favor of the treaty with reservations. A new proposal was then drawn up demanding that the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance of 1778]] be superseded and that France pay for its damages to American property. On February 3, the treaty with the reservations passed 22–9 and was signed by Adams.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=150}}{{efn|Jefferson, after entering office, approved a negotiated end to the 1778 alliance, freeing the United States of foreign entanglements, while excusing France from paying indemnities.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=423}}}} Adams proudly avoided war, but deeply split his party in the process. Historian [[Ron Chernow]] writes that "the threat of Jacobinism" was the one thing that united the Federalist Party, and that Adams' elimination of it unwittingly contributed to the party's demise.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=594}} News of the peace treaty did not arrive in the United States until after the election, too late to sway the results.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=631}}

===Establishing government institutions and move to Washington===
Adams' leadership on naval defense has sometimes led him to be called the "father of the [[American Navy]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/j/john-adams-frigate-i.html|title=John Adams I (Frigate) 1799–1867|publisher=''Naval History and Heritage Command'' |access-date=August 22, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909083339/http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/j/john-adams-frigate-i.html|archivedate=September 9, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Miller|1997|p=9}} In July 1798, he signed into law [[An Act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen]], which authorized the establishment of a government-operated marine hospital service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2011/01/17/congress-passes-socialized-medicine-and-mandates-health-insurance-in-1798/|title=Congress Passes Socialized Medicine and Mandates Health Insurance – In 1798|accessdate=August 23, 2015|publisher=''Forbes''|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812024426/http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2011/01/17/congress-passes-socialized-medicine-and-mandates-health-insurance-in-1798/|archivedate=August 12, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1800, he signed the law establishing the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="OLC"/&gt;

Adams made his first official visit to the nation's new [[seat of government]] in early June 1800. Amid the "raw and unfinished" cityscape, the president found the public buildings "in a much greater forwardness of completion than expected."{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=1036}} He moved into the nearly completed [[White House|President's Mansion]] (later known as the White House) on November 1. Abigail arrived a few weeks later. Upon arriving, Adams wrote to her, "Before I end my letter, I pray Heaven to bestow the best of Blessings on this House and all that shall hereafter inhabit it.

===Election of 1800===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1800}}
[[File:ElectoralCollege1800.svg|thumb|250px|1800 presidential election results]]
With the Federalist Party deeply split over his negotiations with France, and the opposition Republican Party enraged over the Alien and Sedition Acts and the expansion of the military, Adams faced a daunting reelection campaign in [[United States presidential election, 1800|1800]].&lt;ref name=JAelections/&gt; The Federalist congressmen caucused in the spring of 1800 and nominated Adams and [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]]. The Republicans nominated Jefferson and Burr, their candidates in the previous election.&lt;ref name="Ferling, ch. 19"&gt;Ferling, ch. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign was bitter and characterized by malicious insults by partisan presses on both sides. Federalists claimed that the Republicans were the enemies of "all who love order, peace, virtue, and religion." They were said to be libertines and dangerous radicals who favored states' rights over the Union and would instigate anarchy and civil war. Jefferson's rumored [[Sally Hemmings|affairs]] with slaves were used against him. Republicans in turn accused Federalists of subverting republican principles through punitive federal laws and of favoring Britain and the other coalition countries in their war with France to promote aristocratic, anti-republican values. Jefferson was portrayed as an apostle of liberty and man of the people, while Adams was labelled a monarchist. He was accused of insanity and marital infidelity.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=543–545}} [[James T. Callender]], a Republican propagandist secretly financed by Jefferson, degraded Adams' character and accused him of attempting to make war with France. Callender was arrested and jailed under the Sedition Act, which only further inflamed Republican passions.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=536–537}}

Opposition from the Federalist Party was at times equally intense. Some, including Pickering, accused Adams of colluding with Jefferson so that he would end up either president or vice president.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=544}} Hamilton was hard at work, attempting to sabotage the President's reelection. Planning an indictment of Adams' character, he requested and received private documents from both the ousted cabinet secretaries and Wolcott.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=619–620}} The letter was intended for only a few Federalist electors. Upon seeing a draft, several Federalists urged Hamilton not to send it. Wolcott wrote that "the poor old man" could do himself in without Hamilton's assistance. Hamilton did not heed their advice.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=549}} On October 24, he sent a pamphlet strongly attacking Adams' policies and character. Hamilton denounced the "precipitate nomination" of Murray, the pardoning of Fries, and the firing of Pickering. He included a fair share of personal insults, vilifying the President's "disgusting egotism" and "ungovernable temper." Adams, he concluded, was "emotionally unstable, given to impulsive and irrational decisions, unable to coexist with his closest advisers, and generally unfit to be president."&lt;ref name="Adams Pamphlet"/&gt; Strangely, it ended by saying that the electors should support Adams and Pinckney equally.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=550}} Thanks to Burr, who had covertly obtained a copy, the pamphlet became public knowledge and was distributed throughout the country by Republicans, who rejoiced in what it contained.{{sfn|Morse|1884|pp=320–321}} The pamphlet destroyed the Federalist Party, ended Hamilton's political career, and helped ensure Adams' already-likely defeat.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=550}}

When the electoral votes were counted, Adams finished in third place with 65 votes, and Pinckney came in fourth with 64 votes. Jefferson and Burr tied for first place with 73 votes each. Because of the tie, the election devolved upon the House of Representatives, with each state having one vote and a supermajority required for victory. On February 17, 1801 – on the 36th ballot – Jefferson was elected by a vote of 10 to 4 (two states abstained).&lt;ref name=JAelections/&gt;&lt;ref name=ECscore/&gt; It is noteworthy that Hamilton's scheme, although it made the Federalists appear divided and therefore helped Jefferson win, failed in its overall attempt to woo Federalist electors away from Adams.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=626}}{{efn|Ferling attributes Adams's defeat to five factors: the stronger organization of the Republicans; Federalist disunity; the controversy surrounding the Alien and Sedition Acts; the popularity of Jefferson in the South; and the effective politicking of Burr in [[New York (state)|New York]].{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=404–405}} Adams wrote, "No party that ever existed knew itself so little or so vainly overrated its own influence and popularity as ours. None ever understood so ill the causes of its own power, or so wantonly destroyed them."{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=1053}} Stephen G. Kurtz argues that Hamilton and his supporters were primarily responsible for the destruction of the Federalist Party. They viewed the party as a personal tool and played into the hands of the Jeffersonians by building up a large standing army and creating a feud with Adams.{{sfn|Kurtz|1957|p=331}} Chernow writes that Hamilton believed that by eliminating Adams, he could eventually pick up the pieces of the ruined Federalist Party and lead it back to dominance: "Better to purge Adams and let Jefferson govern for a while than to water down the party's ideological purity with compromises."{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=626}}}}

To compound the agony of his defeat, Adams' son Charles, a long-time alcoholic, died on November 30. Anxious to rejoin Abigail, who had already left for Massachusetts, Adams departed the White House in the predawn hours of March 4, 1801, and did not attend [[First inauguration of Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson's inauguration]]. Since him, only three out-going presidents (having served a full term) have not attended their successors' inaugurations.&lt;ref name="Ferling, ch. 19"/&gt; The complications arising out of the 1796 and 1800 elections prompted Congress and the states to refine the process whereby the Electoral College elects a president and a vice president through the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]], which became a part of the Constitution in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xii |title=Election of President and Vice President |last=Levinson |first=Sanford V. |publisher=''Constitution Center'' |access-date=September 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams appointed two [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] associate justices during his term in office: [[Bushrod Washington]], the nephew of American founding father and President George Washington, and [[Alfred Moore]].&lt;ref name="Ferling, ch. 19"/&gt; After the retirement of Ellsworth due to ill health in 1800, it fell to Adams to appoint the Court's fourth Chief Justice. At the time, it was not yet certain whether Jefferson or Burr would win the election. Regardless, Adams believed that the choice should be someone "in the full vigor of middle age" who could counter what might be a long line of successive Republican presidents. Adams chose his Secretary of State John Marshall.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|pp=1063–1064}} He, along with Stoddert, was one of Adams' few trusted cabinet members, and was among the first to greet him when he arrived at the White House.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=550}} Adams signed his commission on January 31 and the Senate approved it immediately.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=560}} Marshall's long tenure left a lasting influence on the Court. He maintained a carefully reasoned nationalistic interpretation of the Constitution and established the judicial branch as the equal of the executive and legislative branches.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=411}}

After the Federalists lost control of both houses of Congress along with the White House in the election of 1800, the [[lame-duck session]] of the 6th Congress in February 1801 approved a judiciary act, commonly known as the [[Midnight Judges Act]], which created a set of federal appeals courts between the district courts and the Supreme Court. Adams filled the vacancies created in this statute by appointing a series of judges, whom his opponents called the "Midnight Judges," just days before his term expired. Most of these judges lost their posts when the [[7th United States Congress|7th Congress]], with a solid Republican majority, approved the [[Judiciary Act of 1802]], abolishing the newly created courts.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=408–410}}

==Retirement==
===Initial years===
Adams resumed farming at Peacefield in the town of Quincy and began work on an autobiography. The work had numerous gaps and was eventually abandoned and left unedited.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=421–423}} Most of Adams' attention was focused on farm work. His frugal lifestyle and presidential salary had left him with a considerable fortune by 1801. In 1803, the bank holding his cash reserves of about $13,000 collapsed. John Quincy resolved the crisis by buying his properties in Weymouth and Quincy, including Peacefield, for $12,800.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=435}} During the first four years of retirement, Adams made little effort to contact others, but eventually resumed contact with old acquaintances such as [[Benjamin Waterhouse]] and [[Benjamin Rush]].{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=426}}

Adams generally stayed quiet on public matters. He did not publicly denounce Jefferson's actions as president,{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=595}} believing that "instead of opposing Systematically any Administration, running down their Characters and opposing all their Measures right or wrong, We ought to Support every Administration as far as We can in Justice."&lt;ref name="Adams 1808"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/99-02-02-5238 |title=From John Adams to Benjamin Rush, 18 April 1808 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=October 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a disgruntled James Callender, angry at not being appointed to an office, turned on the President by revealing the [[Sally Hemings]] affair, Adams said nothing.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=579–585}} John Quincy was elected to the Senate in 1803. Shortly thereafter, both he and his father crossed party lines to support Jefferson's [[Louisiana Purchase]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=586}} The only major political incident involving Adams during the Jefferson years was a dispute with [[Mercy Otis Warren]] in 1806. Warren, an old friend, had attacked Adams in a pamphlet for his "partiality for monarchy" and "pride of talents and much ambition." A tempestuous correspondence ensued. In time, their friendship healed.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=594–596}} Adams did privately criticize the President over his [[Embargo Act of 1807|Embargo Act]],&lt;ref name="Adams 1808"/&gt; despite the fact that John Quincy voted for it.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=598–599}} John Quincy resigned from the Senate in 1808 after the Federalist-controlled State Senate refused to nominate him for a second term. After the Federalists denounced John Quincy as no longer being of their party, Adams wrote to him that he himself had long since "abdicated and disclaimed the name and character and attributes of that sect."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=599}}

After Jefferson's retirement from public life in 1809, Adams became more vocal. He published a three-year marathon of letters in the ''[[Boston Patriot (newspaper)|Boston Patriot]]'' newspaper, refuting line-by-line Hamilton's 1800 pamphlet. The initial piece was written shortly after his return from Peacefield and "had gathered dust for eight years." Adams had decided to shelve it over fears that it could negatively impact John Quincy should he ever seek office. Although Hamilton had died in 1804 in [[Burr–Hamilton duel|a duel with Aaron Burr]], Adams felt the need to vindicate his character against his charges. With his son having broken from the Federalist Party and joined the Republicans, he felt he could safely do so without threatening his political career.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=429–430}} Adams supported the [[War of 1812]]. Having worried over the rise of sectionalism, he celebrated the growth of a "national character" that accompanied it.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=425–426}}

Daughter [[Abigail Adams Smith|Abigail ("Nabby")]] was married to [[Congressman|Representative]] [[William Stephens Smith]], but she returned to her parents' home after the failure of the marriage; she died of [[breast cancer]] in 1813.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=430}}

===Correspondence with Jefferson===
In early 1801, Adams sent Thomas Jefferson a brief note after returning to Quincy wishing him a happy and prosperous presidency. Jefferson failed to respond, and they did not speak again for nearly 12 years. In 1804, Abigail, unbeknownst to her husband, wrote to Jefferson to express her condolences upon the death of his daughter [[Mary Jefferson Eppes|Polly]], who had stayed with the Adamses in London in 1787. This initiated a brief correspondence between the two which quickly descended into political rancor. Jefferson terminated it by not replying to Abigail's fourth letter. Aside from that, by 1812 there had been no communication between Peacefield and Monticello since Adams left office.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=431}}

[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Portrait of John Adams - Samuel Finley Breese Morse - overall.jpg|thumb|left|John Adams, c. 1816, by [[Samuel Morse]] ([[Brooklyn Museum of Art|Brooklyn Museum]])|alt=An unsmiling elderly man sits in a red chair, slightly pointing left.]]

In early 1812, Adams reconciled with Jefferson. The previous year had been tragic for Adams; his brother-in-law and friend Richard Cranch had died along with his widow Mary, and Nabby had been diagnosed with breast cancer. These events mellowed Adams and caused him to soften his outlook.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=429–430}} Their mutual friend Benjamin Rush, a fellow signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] who had been corresponding with both, encouraged them to reach out to each other. On New Year's Day, Adams sent a brief, friendly note to Jefferson to accompany the delivery of "two pieces of homespun," a two-volume collection of lectures on rhetoric by John Quincy Adams. Jefferson replied immediately with a cordial letter, and the two men revived their friendship, which they sustained by mail. The correspondence that they resumed in 1812 lasted the rest of their lives, and has been hailed as among their great legacies of American literature. Their letters represent an insight into both the period and the minds of the two revolutionary leaders and presidents. The missives lasted fourteen years, and consisted of 158 letters – 109 from Adams and 49 from Jefferson.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=431–432}}

Early on, Adams repeatedly tried to turn the correspondence to a discussion of their actions in the political arena.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=607}} Jefferson refused to oblige him, saying that "nothing new can be added by you or me to what has been said by others and will be said in every age."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson to John Adams, June 27, 1813. Cappon p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; Adams made one more attempt, writing that "You and I ought not to die before we have explained ourselves to each other."&lt;ref&gt;John Adams to Thomas Jefferson, July 15, 1813. Cappon p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, Jefferson declined to engage Adams in this sort of discussion. Adams accepted this, and the correspondence turned to other matters, particularly philosophy and their daily habits.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=608}}{{efn|The two men discussed "natural aristocracy." Jefferson said, "The natural aristocracy I consider as the most precious gift of nature for the instruction, the trusts, and government of society. And indeed it would have been inconsistent in creation to have formed man for the social state, and not to have provided virtue and wisdom enough to manage the concerns of society. May we not even say that the form of government is best which provides most effectually for a pure selection of these natural [aristocrats] into the offices of government?"&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson to John Adams, October 28, 1813. Cappon, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; Adams wondered if it ever would be so clear who these people were, "Your distinction between natural and artificial aristocracy does not appear to me well founded. Birth and wealth are conferred on some men as imperiously by nature, as genius, strength, or beauty. ... When aristocracies are established by human laws and honour, wealth, and power are made hereditary by municipal laws and political institutions, then I acknowledge artificial aristocracy to commence." It would always be true, Adams argued, that fate would bestow influence on some men for reasons other than wisdom and virtue. A good government had to account for that reality.&lt;ref&gt;John Adams to Thomas Jefferson, November 15, 1813. Cappon, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the two grew older, the letters became fewer and farther between. There was also important information that each man kept to himself. Jefferson said nothing about his construction of a new house, domestic turmoil, slave ownership, or poor financial situation, while Adams did not mention the troublesome behavior of his son Thomas, who had failed as a lawyer and become an alcoholic, resorting afterwards to living primarily as a caretaker at Peacefield.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=634}}

===Last years and death===
Abigail died of [[typhoid]] on October 28, 1818.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=437}} The year 1824 was filled with excitement in America, featuring a [[United States presidential election, 1824|four way presidential contest]] which included John Quincy. The [[Marquis de Lafayette]] toured the country and met briefly with Adams, who greatly enjoyed the visit.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=637}} Adams was delighted by the election of John Quincy to the presidency. The results became official in February 1825 after a deadlock was decided in the House of Representatives. He did remark, "No man who ever held the office of President would congratulate a friend on obtaining it."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=639}}

Less than a month before his death, Adams issued a statement about the destiny of the United States, which historian [[Joy Hakim]] characterized as a warning for his fellow citizens: "My best wishes, in the joys, and festivities, and the solemn services of that day on which will be completed the fiftieth year from its birth, of the independence of the United States: a memorable epoch in the annals of the human race, destined in future history to form the brightest or the blackest page, according to the use or the abuse of those political institutions by which they shall, in time to come, be shaped by the human mind."{{sfn|Hakim|2003|p=97}}

==Political writings==
===''Thoughts on Government''===
[[File:Thoughts on Government.jpg|thumb|''Thoughts on Government''|alt=title page of Adam's pamphlet]]
During the First Continental Congress, Adams was sometimes solicited for his views on government. While recognizing its importance, Adams had privately criticized [[Thomas Paine]]'s 1776 pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'', which attacked all forms of monarchy, even constitutional monarchy of the sort advocated by [[John Locke]]. It supported a unicameral legislature and a weak executive elected by the legislature. According to Adams, the author had "a better hand at pulling down than building."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=97}} He believed that the views expressed in the pamphlet were "so democratical, without any restraint or even an attempt at any equilibrium or counter poise, that it must produce confusion and every evil work."{{sfn|Foot|Kramnick|1987|p=11}} What Paine advocated was a radical democracy with the views of the majority neither checked nor counterbalanced. This was incompatible with the system of checks and balances that conservatives like Adams would implement.{{sfn|Gimbel|1956|p=21}} Some delegates urged Adams to commit his views to paper. He did so in separate letters to these colleagues. So impressed was Richard Henry Lee that, with Adams' consent, he had the most comprehensive letter printed. Published anonymously in April 1776, it was titled ''[[Thoughts on Government]]'' and styled as "a Letter from a Gentleman to his Friend." Many historians agree that none of Adams' other compositions rivaled the enduring influence of this pamphlet.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=155–157}}

Adams advised that the form of government should be chosen to attain the desired ends – the happiness and virtue of the greatest number of people. He wrote that, "There is no good government but what is [[Republicanism in the United States|republican]]. That the only valuable part of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitution]] is so because the very definition of a republic is an empire of laws, and not of men." The treatise defended [[bicameralism]], for "a single assembly is liable to all the vices, follies and frailties of an individual."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adams|Adams]], Vol. IV, p. 195, "Thoughts on Government"&lt;/ref&gt; Adams suggested that there should be a [[separation of powers]] between the [[executive (government)|executive]], the [[judicial]] and the [[legislative]] branches, and further recommended that if a continental government were to be formed then it "should sacredly be confined" to certain [[enumerated powers]]. ''Thoughts on Government'' was referenced in every state-constitution writing hall. Adams used the letter to attack opponents of independence. He claimed that [[John Dickinson]]'s fear of republicanism was responsible for his refusal to support independence, and wrote that opposition from Southern planters was rooted in fear that their aristocratic slaveholding status would be endangered by it.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=155–157}}

===Massachusetts Constitution===
After returning from his first mission to France in 1779, Adams was elected to the [[Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1779–1780|Massachusetts Constitutional Convention]] with the purpose of establishing a new constitution for Massachusetts. He served on a committee of three, also including Samuel Adams and [[James Bowdoin]], to draft the constitution. The task of writing it fell primarily to John Adams. The resulting [[Constitution of Massachusetts]] was approved in 1780. It was the first constitution written by a special committee, then ratified by the people; and was the first to feature a bicameral legislature. Included were a distinct executive – though restrained by an executive council – with a qualified (two-thirds) veto, and an independent judicial branch. The judges were given lifetime appointments, allowed to "hold their offices during good behavior."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=214–216}}

The Constitution affirmed the "duty" of the individual to worship the "Supreme Being," and that he had the right to do so without molestation "in the manner most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=222}} It established a system of public education that would provide free schooling for three years to the children of all citizens.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=272}} Adams was a strong believer in good education as one of the pillars of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. He believed that people "in a State of Ignorance" were more easily enslaved while those "enlightened with knowledge" would be better able to protect their liberties.{{sfn|Burns|2013|p=76}} Adams became one of the founders of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1780.{{sfn|Cochrane|1978|p=7}}

===''Defence of the Constitutions''===
Adams' preoccupation with political and governmental affairs–which caused considerable separation from his wife and children–had a distinct familial context, which he articulated in 1780: "I must study Politicks and War that my sons may have the liberty to study Mathematicks and Philosophy. My sons ought to study Geography, natural History, Naval Architecture, navigation, Commerce and Agriculture, in order to give their children a right to study Painting, Poetry, Musick, Architecture, Statuary, Tapestry, and Porcelaine."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=174–175}}

While in London, Adams learned of a [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|convention]] being planned to amend the [[Articles of Confederation]]. In January 1787, he published a work entitled ''A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org/jadams/ja1_00.htm |title=John Adams: Defence of the Constitutions, 1787 |publisher=''Constitution.org'' |accessdate=March 2, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125085353/http://www.constitution.org/jadams/ja1_00.htm |archivedate=January 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet repudiated the views of [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] and other European writers as to the viciousness of state government frameworks. He suggested that "the rich, the well-born and the able" should be set apart from other men in a senate – that would prevent them from dominating the lower house. Adams' ''Defence'' is described as an articulation of the theory of [[mixed government]]. Adams contended that social classes exist in every political society, and that a good government must accept that reality. For centuries, dating back to [[Aristotle]], a mixed regime balancing monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy – that is, the king, the nobles, and the people – was required to preserve order and liberty.{{sfn|Adams|1954|p=xvii}}

Historian [[Gordon S. Wood]] has maintained that Adams' political philosophy had become irrelevant by the time the Federal Constitution was ratified. By then, American political thought, transformed by more than a decade of vigorous debate as well as formative experiential pressures, had abandoned the classical perception of politics as a mirror of social estates. Americans' new understanding of [[popular sovereignty]] was that the citizenry were the sole possessors of power in the nation. Representatives in the government enjoyed mere portions of the people's power and only for a limited time. Adams was thought to have overlooked this evolution and revealed his continued attachment to the older version of politics.{{sfn|Wood|2006|pp=173–202}} Yet Wood was accused of ignoring Adams' peculiar definition of the term "republic," and his support for a constitution ratified by the people.{{sfn|Thompson|1998|p=317}}

On [[separation of powers]], Adams wrote that, "Power must be opposed to power, and interest to interest."&lt;ref name="Works of John Adams, IV:557"&gt;Works of John Adams, IV:557&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment was later echoed by James Madison's statement that, "[a]mbition must be made to counteract ambition," in [[Federalist No. 51]], explaining the separation of powers established under the new Constitution.&lt;ref name="Works of John Adams, IV:557"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Madison |first=James|title=The Federalist No. 51 |url=http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=The_Federalist_Papers/No._51&amp;oldid=504230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams believed that human beings were naturally desirous of furthering their own ambitions, and a single democratically elected house, if left unchecked, would be subject to this error, and therefore needed to be checked by an upper house and an executive. He wrote that a strong executive would defend the people's liberties against "aristocrats" attempting to take it away.&lt;ref name="Ralston"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/amer-enl/#SH3d |title=American Enlightenment Thought |last=Ralston |first=Shane J. |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the government's role in education Adams stated that, "The whole people must take upon themselves the education of the whole people and be willing to bear the expenses of it. There should not be a district of one mile square, without a school in it, not founded by a charitable individual, but maintained at the public expense of the people themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Letter to [[John Jebb (reformer)|John Jebb]], Vol. 9, p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams first saw the new [[United States Constitution]] in late 1787. To Jefferson, he wrote that he read it "with great satisfaction." Adams did express regret that the president would be unable to make appointments without [[United States Senate|Senate]] approval and over the absence of a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. "Should not such a thing have preceded the model?" he asked.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=379}}

==Political philosophy and views==
===Slavery===
Adams never owned a [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] and declined on principle to utilize slave labor, saying, "I have, through my whole life, held the practice of slavery in such abhorrence, that I have never owned a negro or any other slave, though I have lived for many years in times, when the practice was not disgraceful, when the best men in my vicinity thought it not inconsistent with their character, and when it has cost me thousands of dollars for the labor and subsistence of free men, which I might have saved by the purchase of negroes at times when they were very cheap."&lt;ref name=RJEvans&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/2127#lf1431-10_head_152|last=Adams|first=John|title=Letter to Robert J. Evans|date=June 8, 1819|publisher=[[Liberty Fund Inc.]]|accessdate=February 3, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203234949/http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/2127#lf1431-10_head_152|archivedate=February 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the war, he occasionally represented slaves in suits for their freedom.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=77}} Adams generally tried to keep the issue out of national politics, because of the anticipated Southern response during a time when unity was needed to achieve independence. He spoke out in 1777 against a bill to emancipate slaves in Massachusetts, saying that the issue was presently too divisive, and so the legislation should "sleep for a time." He also was against use of black soldiers in the Revolution due to opposition from Southerners.{{sfn|Wiencek|2004|p=215}} Slavery was abolished in Massachusetts about 1780, when it was forbidden by implication in the Declaration of Rights that John Adams wrote into the Massachusetts Constitution.{{sfn|Moore|1866|pp=200–203}} Abigail Adams vocally opposed slavery.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=26}}

===Accusations of monarchism===
Throughout his lifetime Adams expressed controversial and shifting views regarding the virtues of monarchical and hereditary political institutions.&lt;ref name="Mark O. Hatfield, Vice Pres"&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark O.|last=Hatfield|year=1997|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/john_adams.pdf|title=Vice Presidents of the United States|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|pages=3–11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219094306/https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/john_adams.pdf|archivedate=December 19, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times he conveyed substantial support for these approaches, suggesting for example that "hereditary monarchy or aristocracy" are the "only institutions that can possibly preserve the laws and liberties of the people."{{sfn|Adams|1892|p=38}} Yet at other times he distanced himself from such ideas, calling himself "a mortal and irreconcilable enemy to Monarchy" and "no friend to hereditary limited monarchy in America."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=410}} Such denials did not assuage his critics, and Adams was often accused of being a monarchist.&lt;ref name="John &amp; Abigail Adams"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/adams/peopleevents/p_callender.html|title=John &amp; Abigail Adams|publisher=PBS online|accessdate=July 17, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730143702/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/adams/peopleevents/p_callender.html|archivedate=July 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Clinton Rossiter]] portrays Adams not as a monarchist but a revolutionary conservative who sought to balance republicanism with the stability of monarchy to create "ordered liberty."{{sfn|Rossiter|1955|p=114}} His 1790 ''Discourses on Davila'' published in the ''Gazette of the United States'' warned once again of the dangers of unbridled democracy.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=421}}

[[File:Gilbert Stuart John Adams.jpg|thumb|John Adams by [[Gilbert Stuart]] (1823). This portrait was the last ever made of Adams, done at the request of John Quincy.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=638}}|alt=An elderly man sits in a red chair with his arms crossed, looking slightly left.]]
Many of these attacks are considered to have been scurrilous, including suggestions that he was planning to "crown himself king" and "grooming John Quincy as heir to the throne."&lt;ref name="John &amp; Abigail Adams"/&gt; Peter Shaw has argued that: "[T]he inevitable attacks on Adams, crude as they were, stumbled on a truth that he did not admit to himself. He was leaning toward monarchy and aristocracy (as distinct from kings and aristocrats) ... Decidedly, sometime after he became vice-president, Adams concluded that the United States would have to adopt a hereditary legislature and a monarch ... and he outlined a plan by which state conventions would appoint hereditary senators while a national one appointed a president for life."{{sfn|Shaw|1975|pp=230–237}} In contrast to such notions, Adams asserted in a letter to Thomas Jefferson:

{{quote|If you suppose that I have ever had a design or desire of attempting to introduce a government of King, Lords and Commons, or in other words an hereditary Executive, or an hereditary Senate, either into the government of the United States, or that of any individual state, in this country, you are wholly mistaken. There is not such a thought expressed or intimated in any public writing or private letter of mine, and I may safely challenge all of mankind to produce such a passage and quote the chapter and verse.{{sfn|Adams|2004|p=466}}}}

According to Luke Mayville, Adams synthesized two strands of thought: [[political science|practical study]] of past and present governments, and [[Scottish Enlightenment]] thinking concerning individual desires expressed in politics.{{sfn|Mayville|2016|pp=11–14}} Adams conclusion was that the great danger was that an [[oligarchy]] of the wealthy would take hold to the detriment of equality. To counter that danger, the power of the wealthy needed to be channeled by institutions, and checked by a strong executive.{{sfn|Mayville|2016|pp=11–14}}&lt;ref name="Ralston"/&gt;

===Religious views===

Adams was raised a [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], since his ancestors were Puritans. According to biographer [[David McCullough]], "as his family and friends knew, Adams was both a devout Christian, and an independent thinker, and he saw no conflict in that."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=18}} In a letter to Rush, Adams credited religion with the success of his ancestors since their migration to the New World.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=22}} He believed that regular church service was beneficial to man's moral sense. Everett (1966) concludes that "Adams strove for a religion based on a common sense sort of reasonableness" and maintained that religion must change and evolve toward perfection.{{sfn|Everett|1966|pp=49–57}} Fielding (1940) argues that Adams' beliefs synthesized Puritan, [[deism|deist]], and [[humanism|humanist]] concepts. Adams at one point said that Christianity had originally been [[revelation|revelatory]], but was being misinterpreted in the service of superstition, fraud, and unscrupulous power.{{sfn|Fielding|1940|pp=33–46}}

Frazer (2004) notes that while he shared many perspectives with deists and often used deistic terminology, "Adams clearly was not a deist. Deism rejected any and all supernatural activity and intervention by God; consequently, deists did not believe in miracles or God's providence.&amp;nbsp;... Adams did believe in miracles, providence, and, to a certain extent, the Bible as revelation."&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, Gregg L. (2004). ''The Political Theology of the American Founding''. PhD dissertation. Claremont Graduate University. p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Frazer argues that Adams' "theistic rationalism, like that of the other Founders, was a sort of middle ground between Protestantism and deism."&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, Gregg L. (2004). ''The Political Theology of the American Founding''. PhD dissertation. Claremont Graduate University. p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1796, Adams denounced [[Thomas Paine]]'s deistic criticisms of Christianity in ''[[The Age of Reason]]'', saying, "The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/01-03-02-0013-0002-0015 |title=July 26. 1796. Tuesday. [from the Diary of John Adams] |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his retirement years, Adams moved away from some of the Puritan sentiments of his youth and closer to more mainstream Enlightenment religious ideals. He blamed institutional Christianity for causing much suffering but continued to be an active Christian while maintaining that religion was necessary for society. He became a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], rejecting the divinity of [[Jesus]].{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=433–434}} David L. Holmes argues that Adams, while adopting central tenets of the Unitarian creed, accepted Jesus as the redeemer of humanity and the biblical accounts of [[Miracles of Jesus|his miracles]] as true.{{sfn|Holmes|2006|pp=73–78}}

===Historical reputation===
{{see also|Bibliography of John Adams}}
Franklin summed up what many thought of Adams when he said, "He means well for his country, is always an honest man, often a wise one, but sometimes, and in some things, absolutely out of his senses."{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=518}} Adams came to be seen as someone with a long, distinguished, and spotless career in public service, and a man of great patriotism and integrity, but whose vanity, stubbornness, and cantankerousness often got him into unnecessary trouble. Adams strongly felt that he would be forgotten and underappreciated by history. These feelings often manifested themselves through envy and verbal attacks on other Founders.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=310}}{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=520}}

Historian George Herring argues that Adams was the most independent-minded of the Founders.{{sfn|Herring|2008|p=89}} Though he formally aligned with the Federalists, he was somewhat a party unto himself, at times disagreeing with the Federalists as much as he did the Republicans.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=647}} He was often described as "prickly," but his tenacity was fed by good decisions made in the face of universal opposition.{{sfn|Herring|2008|p=89}} Adams was often combative, which diminished presidential decorum, as he admitted in his old age: "[As president] I refused to suffer in silence. I sighed, sobbed, and groaned, and sometimes screeched and screamed. And I must confess to my shame and sorrow that I sometimes swore."{{sfn|Ellis|1993|p=57}} Stubbornness was seen as one of his defining traits, a fact for which Adams made no apology. "Thanks to God that he gave me stubbornness when I know I am right," he wrote.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=272}} His resolve to advance peace with France while maintaining a posture of defense reduced his popularity and contributed to his defeat for reelection.{{sfn|Herring|2008|pp=90–91}} Most historians applaud him for avoiding an all-out war with France during his presidency. His signing of the Alien and Sedition Acts is almost always condemned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://millercenter.org/president/adams/impact-and-legacy |title=John Adams: Impact and Legacy |last=Taylor |first=C. James |location=Charlottesville, VA |publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia |access-date=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ferling, Adams' political philosophy fell "out of step" with the way that the country was heading. The country tended further away from Adams' emphasis on order and the rule of law and towards the Jeffersonian vision of liberty and weak central government. In the years following his retirement from public life, as first [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonianism]] and then [[Jacksonian democracy]] grew to dominate American politics, Adams was largely forgotten.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=4}} When his name was mentioned, it was typically not in a favorable way. In the [[United States presidential election, 1840|1840 presidential election]], [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate [[William Henry Harrison]] was attacked by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] on the false allegation that he had once been a supporter of John Adams.{{sfn|Shafer|2016|pp=128–129}} Adams was eventually subject to criticism from [[states' rights]] advocates. [[Edward A. Pollard]], a strong supporter of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]], singled out Adams, writing:

{{quote|The first President from the North, John Adams, asserted and essayed to put into practice the supremacy of the "National" power over the states and the citizens thereof. He was sustained in his attempted usurpations by all the New England states and by a powerful public sentiment in each of the Middle States. The "[[strict constructionism|strict constructionists]]" of the Constitution were not slow in raising the standard of opposition against a pernicious error.{{sfn|Pollard|1862|p=12}}}}

In the 21st century, Adams remains less well known than many of America's other Founding Fathers. McCullough argued that "[t]he problem with Adams is that most Americans know nothing about him." Todd Leopold of [[CNN]] wrote in 2001 that Adams is "remembered as that guy who served a single term as president between Washington and Jefferson, and as a short, vain, somewhat rotund man whose stature seems to have been dwarfed by his lanky colleagues."&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/books/06/07/david.mccullough/ |title=David McCullough brings 'John Adams' to life |last=Leopold |first=Todd |publisher=''CNN'' |date=June 7, 2006 |access-date=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has always been seen, Ferling says, as "honest and dedicated," but despite his lengthy career in public service, Adams is still overshadowed by the dramatic military and political achievements and strong personalities of his contemporaries.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=2–3}} Gilbert Chinard, in his 1933 biography of Adams, described the man as "staunch, honest stubborn and somewhat narrow."{{sfn|Chinard|1933|p=vi}} In his 2-volume 1962 biography, Page Smith lauds Adams for his fight against radicals such as Thomas Paine, whose promised reforms portended anarchy and misery. Ferling, in his 1992 biography, writes that "Adams was his own worst enemy." He criticizes him for his "pettiness ... jealousy, and vanity," and faults him for his frequent separations from his wife and children. He praises Adams for his willingness to acknowledge his deficiencies and for striving to overcome them. In 1995, Peter Shaw published ''The Character of John Adams.'' Ferling believes that the man who emerges is one "perpetually at war with himself," whose desire for fame and recognition leads to charges of vanity.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=3–4}}

In 2001, David McCullough published a biography of the president entitled ''[[John Adams (book)|John Adams]]''. McCullough lauds Adams for consistency and honesty, "plays down or explains away" his more controversial actions, such as the dispute over presidential titles and the predawn flight from the White House, and criticizes his friend and rival, Jefferson. The book sold very well and was very favorably received and, along with the Ferling biography, contributed to a rapid resurgence in Adams' reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/05/27/reviews/010527.27maiert.html |title=Plain Speaking: In David McCullough's telling, the second president is reminiscent of the 33rd (Harry Truman) |last=Maier |first=Pauline |date=May 27, 2001 |publisher=''The New York Times'' |access-date=November 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a [[John Adams (miniseries)|miniseries]] was released based on the McCullough biography, featuring [[Paul Giamatti]] as Adams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-ca-giamatti13apr13-story.html |title=Paul Giamatti is so imperfect for the role |last=Lieberman |first=Paul |date=April 13, 2008 |publisher=''The Los Angeles Times'' |access-date=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{s-ref|While Adams won the vice presidency in [[United States presidential election, 1789|1789]] as well, he was not the candidate of the Federalist Party, which had not yet formed.|Technically, Adams was a presidential candidate in 1792 and Pinckney was a presidential candidate in 1796. Prior to the passage of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] in 1804, each presidential elector could cast two ballots; the highest vote-getter would become president and the runner-up would become vice president. Thus, in 1792, with [[George Washington]] as the prohibitive favorite for president, the Federalist party fielded Adams as a presidential candidate, with the intention that he be elected to the vice presidency. Similarly, in 1796 and 1800, the Federalist party fielded two candidates, Adams and Thomas Pinckney, in 1796 and Adams and [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney|Charles Pinckney]] in 1800, with the intention that Adams be elected president and Pinckney be elected vice president.}}

In computing, '''Linux-IO''' ('''LIO''') '''Target''' is an open-source implementation of the [[SCSI target]] that has become the standard one included in the [[Linux kernel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://linux-iscsi.org/wiki/Target |title=Target| date=2012-10-23| accessdate=2012-12-25| publisher=linux-iscsi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2014}} Internally, LIO does not initiate sessions, but instead provides one or more [[Logical Unit Number]]s (LUNs), waits for SCSI commands from a [[SCSI initiator]], and performs required input/output data transfers.  LIO supports common storage fabrics, including  [[FCoE]], [[Fibre Channel]], [[IEEE 1394]], [[iSCSI]], [[iSCSI Extensions for RDMA]] (iSER), [[SCSI RDMA Protocol]] (SRP) and [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]]. It is included in most [[Linux distribution]]s; native support for LIO in [[QEMU]]/[[Kernel-based Virtual Machine|KVM]], [[libvirt]], and [[OpenStack]] makes LIO also a storage option for cloud deployments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/lio-iscsi-support| title=Support LIO as an iSCSI backend| author=Eric Harney | publisher=launchpad.net| date=2012-12-17| accessdate= 2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/linux/pdfs/KVM_Virtualized_IO_Performance_Paper_v2.pdf |author=IBM, Red Hat |title=KVM Virtualized I/O Performance |date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LIO is maintained by Datera, Inc., a [[Silicon Valley]] vendor of storage systems and software. On January 15, 2011, LIO SCSI target engine was merged into the [[Linux kernel mainline]], in kernel version 2.6.38,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=38567333a6dabd0f2b4150e9fb6dd8e3ba2985e5| title=Trivial merge| author=Linus Torvalds| publisher=lkml.org| date=2011-01-15| accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-2-6-38-Part-4-Storage-1199926.html| title=Kernel Log: Coming in 2.6.38 (Part 4) - Storage| author=Thorsten Leemhuis| publisher=Heise Online| date=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was released on March 14, 2011. Additional fabric modules have been merged into subsequent Linux releases.

A competing generic SCSI target module for Linux is [[SCST]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/424004/ |title=A tale of two SCSI targets |publisher=Lwn.net |date= |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the narrower purpose providing a Linux [[iSCSI target]], the older IET and STGT modules also enjoy industry support.&lt;ref&gt;Florian Haas, "[http://porky.linuxjournal.com:8080/LJ/217/11275.html Replicate Everything! Highly Available iSCSI Storage with DRBD and Pacemaker]", (Linux iSCSI: a Tale of Four Targets section) ''[[Linux Journal]]'' Issue #217, May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[SCSI]] standard provides an extensible semantic abstraction for [[computer data storage]] devices, and as such has become a "[[lingua franca]]" for data storage systems. The SCSI T10 standards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.t10.org/| title=SCSI Storage Interfaces| author=Technical Committee T10| publisher=t10.org| accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; define the [[SCSI command|commands]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=SCSI Commands Reference Manual| publisher=Seagate Technology| url=http://www.seagate.com/staticfiles/support/disc/manuals/Interface%20manuals/100293068c.pdf| format=PDF| location=Scotts Valley| series=100293068, Rev. C| date=April 2010| accessdate=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and protocols of the SCSI command processor (sent in ''[[SCSI CDB]]s''), and the electrical and optical interfaces for various implementations.

A ''SCSI initiator'' is the endpoint that initiates a [[SCSI]] session. A ''[[SCSI initiator and target|SCSI target]]'' is the endpoint that waits for initiator commands and executes the required [[input/output|I/O]] data transfers. The SCSI target usually exports one or more [[Logical unit number|LUN]]s for initiators to operate on.

The LIO Linux SCSI Target implements a generic SCSI target that provides remote access to most data storage device types over all prevalent storage fabrics and protocols. LIO neither directly accesses data nor does it directly communicate with applications. LIO provides a highly efficient, fabric-independent and fabric-transparent abstraction for the semantics of numerous data storage device types.

==Architecture==
[[File:LIO-Architecture.png|300px|thumb|LIO Architecture]]

LIO implements a modular and extensible architecture around a versatile and highly efficient, parallelized SCSI command processing engine. The SCSI target engine implements the semantics of a SCSI target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Nicholas |last=Bellinger |title=Current Status and Future of iSCSI on the Linux platform
|conference=Linux Plumbers Conference |year=2009 |url=http://linuxplumbersconf.org/2009/slides/Nicholas-A.-Bellinger-LIO-LPC-2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LIO SCSI target engine is independent of specific fabric modules or backstore types. Thus, LIO supports mixing and matching any number of fabrics and backstores at the same time. The LIO SCSI target engine implements a comprehensive SPC-3/SPC-4&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.t10.org/members/w_spc4.htm| title=SCSI Primary Commands - 4 (SPC-4)| author=Ralph Weber| publisher=t10.org| date=2011-01-17| accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; feature set with support for high-end features, including SCSI-3/SCSI-4 ''Persistent Reservations'' (PRs), SCSI-4 ''Asymmetric Logical Unit Assignment'' (ALUA), [[VMware]] ''vSphere APIs for Array Integration'' (VAAI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://linux-iscsi.org/wiki/VAAI |title=VAAI| author=LIO Linux SCSI Target| date=2012-12-23| accessdate=2012-12-25| publisher=linux-iscsi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Data Integrity Field|T10 DIF]], etc.

LIO is configurable via a [[configfs]]-based&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://lwn.net/Articles/148973/| title=Configfs - an introduction| author=Jonathan Corbet| publisher=lwn.net| date=2005-08-24| accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; kernel API, and can be managed via a command-line interface and API (''[[#targetcli|targetcli]]'').

===SCSI target===
The concept of a SCSI target isn't narrowly restricted to physical devices on a SCSI bus, but instead provides a generalized model for all receivers on a logical SCSI fabric. This includes SCSI sessions across interconnects with no physical SCSI bus at all. Conceptually, the SCSI target provides a generic block storage service or [[server (computing)|server]] in this scenario.

===Backstores===
Backstores provide the SCSI target with generalized access to data storage devices by importing them via corresponding device drivers. Backstores don't need to be physical SCSI devices.

The most important backstore media types are:

* '''Block''': The block driver allows using raw Linux block devices as backstores for export via LIO. This includes physical devices, such as [[hard disk drive|HDD]]s, [[solid-state drive|SSD]]s, [[Compact Disc|CD]]s/[[DVD]]s, [[RAM drive|RAM disk]]s, etc., and logical devices, such as software or hardware [[RAID]] volumes or [[Logical Volume Manager (Linux)|LVM]] volumes.
* '''File''': The file driver allows using files that can reside in any Linux [[file system]] or [[clustered file system]] as backstores for export via LIO.
* '''Raw''': The raw driver allows using unstructured memory as backstores for export via LIO.

As a result, LIO provides a generalized model to export block storage.

===Fabric modules===
Fabric modules implement the frontend of the SCSI target by encapsulating and abstracting the properties of the various supported interconnect. The following fabric modules are available.

====FCoE====
[[File:Storage FCoE.png|thumb|Combined storage and local area network]]

The ''[[Fibre Channel over Ethernet]]'' (FCoE) fabric module allows the transport of [[Fibre Channel]] protocol (FCP) traffic across [[data center bridging|lossless Ethernet]] networks. The specification, supported by a large number of network and storage vendors, is part of the Technical Committee T11 FC-BB-5 standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fibre Channel: Backbone - 5 revision 2.00 |url=http://www.t11.org/ftp/t11/pub/fc/bb-5/09-056v5.pdf |date=June 4, 2009 |publisher=American National Standard for Information Technology [[International Committee for Information Technology Standards]] Technical Group T11 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LIO supports all standard Ethernet NICs.

The FCoE fabric module was contributed by [[Cisco]] and [[Intel]], and released with Linux 3.0 on July 21, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=3699d92a4d7b649bde67dff3cc681400992e0254| title=&amp;#91;SCSI&amp;#93; tcm_fc: Adding FC_FC4 provider (tcm_fc) for FCoE target (TCM - target core) support| author=Linus Torvalds| date=2011-04-18| accessdate=2012-12-24| publisher=torvalds/linux-2.6.git}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fibre Channel====
[[Fibre Channel]] is a high-speed network technology primarily used for storage networking. It is standardized in the Technical Committee T11&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.t11.org/index.html| title=T11 Home Page| accessdate=2012-12-25| publisher=t11.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the InterNational Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS).

The [[QLogic]] Fibre Channel fabric module supports 4- and 8-[[gigabit]] speeds with the following HBAs:

* QLogic 2400 Series (QLx246x), 4GFC
* QLogic 2500 Series (QLE256x), 8GFC (fully qual'd)

The Fibre Channel fabric module&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=75f8c1f693eefacc17a65614eb4ed1ee0f84fda6| title=&amp;#91;SCSI&amp;#93; tcm_qla2xxx: Add &gt;= 24xx series fabric module for target-core| author="Linus Torvalds"| date=2012-05-15| accessdate=2012-05-22| publisher=torvalds/linux-2.6.git}}&lt;/ref&gt; and low-level driver&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=2d70c103fd2a066f904712b14239a5ce141f8236| title=&amp;#91;SCSI&amp;#93; qla2xxx: Add LLD target-mode infrastructure for &gt;= 24xx series| author="Linus Torvalds"| date=2012-05-15| accessdate=2012-05-22| publisher=torvalds/linux-2.6.git}}&lt;/ref&gt; (LLD) were released with Linux 3.5 on July 21, 2012.&lt;ref name=linux3.5&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-3-5-Part-2-Filesystems-and-storage-1630816.html| title=Kernel Log: Coming in 3.5 (Part 2) - Filesystems and storage| author=Thorsten Leemhuis| publisher=Heise Online| date=2012-07-03| accessdate=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Linux 3.9, the following QLogic HBAs and CNAs are also supported:

* QLogic 2600 Series (QLE266x), 16GFC, SR-IOV
* QLogic 8300 Series (QLE834x), 16GFS/10 GbE, PCIe Gen3 SR-IOV
* QLogic 8100 Series (QLE81xx), 8GFC/10 GbE, PCIe Gen2

This makes LIO the first open source target to support 16-gigabit Fibre Channel.

====IEEE 1394====
[[File:LIO-Firewire-Target.png|300px|thumb|LIO Firewire Target for Mac [[OS X]]]]

The FireWire SBP-2 fabric module enables [[Linux]] to export local storage devices via [[IEEE 1394]], so that other systems can mount them as an ordinary IEEE 1394 storage device.

IEEE 1394 is a serial bus interface standard for high-speed communications and isochronous real-time data transfer. It was developed by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] as "FireWire" in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and [[Macintosh]] computers have supported "FireWire target disk mode" since 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1661| title=How to use and troubleshoot FireWire target disk mode| accessdate=2012-12-24| publisher=apple.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FireWire SBP-2 fabric module was released with Linux 3.5 on July 21, 2012.&lt;ref name=linux3.5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=a511ce3397803558a3591e55423f3ae6aa28c9db| title=sbp-target: Initial merge of firewire/ieee-1394 target mode support| author=Linus Torvalds| date=2012-04-15| accessdate=2012-12-24| publisher=torvalds/linux-2.6.git}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====iSCSI====
The ''Internet Small Computer System Interface'' ([[iSCSI]]) fabric module allows the transport of SCSI traffic across standard IP networks.

By carrying SCSI sessions across IP networks, iSCSI is used to facilitate data transfers over intranets and to manage storage over long distances. iSCSI can be used to transmit data over local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), or the Internet, and can enable location-independent and location-transparent data storage and retrieval.

The LIO iSCSI fabric module also implements a number of advanced iSCSI features that increase performance and resiliency, such as ''Multiple Connections per Session'' (MC/S) and ''Error Recovery Levels'' 0-2 (ERL=0,1,2).

LIO supports all standard Ethernet NICs.

The [[iSCSI]] fabric module was released with Linux 3.1 on October 24, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=91d41fdf31f74e6e2e5f3cb018eca4200e36e202| title=iSCSI merge| author=Linus Torvalds| date=2011-07-27| accessdate=2012-12-14| publisher=lkml.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|InfiniBand}}

====iSER====
Networks supporting [[remote direct memory access]] (RDMA) can use the [[iSCSI Extensions for RDMA]] (iSER) fabric module to transport [[iSCSI]] traffic.
iSER permits data to be transferred directly into and out of remote SCSI computer memory buffers without intermediate data copies (''direct data placement'' or DDP) by using RDMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Direct Data Placement over Reliable Transports |work=RFC 5041 |author=H. Shah|date=October 2007 |accessdate=2012-12-24|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; RDMA is supported on [[InfiniBand]] networks, on Ethernet  with [[data center bridging]] (DCB) networks via [[RDMA over Converged Ethernet]] (RoCE), and on standard Ethernet networks with [[iWARP]] enhanced [[TCP offload engine]] controllers.

The iSER fabric module was developed together by Datera and [[Mellanox Technologies]], and first released with Linux 3.10 on June 30, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=6da6dc2380c3cfe8d6b59d7c3c55fdd7a521fe6c| title=Merge branch 'for-next-merge'| author=Linus Torvalds| date=2013-04-30| accessdate=2013-07-07| publisher=lkml.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====SRP====
The ''[[SCSI RDMA Protocol]]'' (SRP) fabric module allows the transport of SCSI traffic across RDMA (see above) networks. As of 2013, SRP was more widely used than iSER, although it is more limited, as SCSI is only a peer-to-peer protocol, whereas iSCSI is fully routable.
The SRP fabric module supports the following Mellanox [[host channel adapter]]s (HCAs):

* Mellanox ConnectX-2 VPI PCIe Gen2 HCAs (x8 lanes), single/dual-port QDR 40 Gbit/s
* Mellanox ConnectX-3 VPI PCIe Gen3 HCAs (x8 lanes), single/dual-port FDR 56 Gbit/s
* Mellanox ConnectX-IB PCIe Gen3 HCAs (x16 lanes), single/dual-port FDR 56 Gbit/s

The SRP fabric module was released with Linux 3.3 on March 18, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git;a=commit;h=f59e842fc0871cd5baa213dc32e0ce8e5aaf4758| title=InfiniBand/SRP merge| author=Linus Torvalds| date=2012-01-18| accessdate=2012-12-24| publisher=lkml.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[c't]] magazine measured almost 5000 MB/s throughput with LIO SRP Target over one Mellanox ConnectX-3 port in 56 Gbit/s FDR mode on a [[Sandy Bridge (microarchitecture)|Sandy Bridge]] [[PCI Express]] 3.0 system with four [[Fusion-io|Fusion-IO]] ioDrive PCI Express flash memory cards.

====USB====
The ''USB Gadget'' fabric module enables Linux to export local storage devices via the [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB), so that other systems can mount them as an ordinary storage device.

USB was designed in the mid-1990s to standardize the connection of [[computer peripheral]]s, and has also become common for data storage devices.

The USB Gadget fabric module was released with Linux 3.5 on July 21, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git;a=commit;h=ba01a87e37d3ca9efe141e2907c2ec3f89490b4f| title=Merge branch 'usb-target-merge'| accessdate=2012-12-24| publisher=torvalds/linux-2.6.git}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===targetcli===
''targetcli'' is a user space single-node management ''[[command line interface]]'' (CLI) for LIO.&lt;ref name="targetcli"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://linux-iscsi.org/wiki/Targetcli |title=Targetcli| author=LIO Linux SCSI Target| date=2012-12-09| accessdate=2012-12-25| publisher=linux-iscsi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It supports all fabric modules and is based on a modular, extensible architecture, with plug-in modules for additional fabric modules or functionality.

''targetcli'' provides a CLI that uses an underlying generic target library through a well-defined API. Thus the CLI can easily be replaced or complemented by a UI with other metaphors, such as a GUI.

''targetcli'' is implemented in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and consists of three main modules:

* the underlying ''rtslib'' and API.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://github.com/Datera/targetcli.git |title=Package rtslib| author=Jerome Martin| date=2011-08-03| accessdate=2012-12-25| publisher=daterainc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the ''configshell'', which encapsulates the fabric-specific attributes in corresponding 'spec' files.
* the ''targetcli'' shell itself.

Detailed instructions on how to set up LIO targets can be found on the LIO wiki.&lt;ref name="targetcli"/&gt;

==Linux distributions==
''targetcli'' and LIO are included in most Linux distributions per default. Here is an overview over the most popular ones, together with the initial inclusion dates:

'''Leonid Naumovich Stolovich''' ({{lang-ru|Леони́д Нау́мович Столович}}; {{lang-et|Leonid Stolovitš}}; July 22, 1929, [[Leningrad]] – November 4, 2013, [[Tartu]]) was a [[Russian philosophy|Russian]]–[[Estonia]]n [[philosopher]], Doctor of Philosophy (1966) and professor (1967).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Delfi |url=http://rus.delfi.ee/daily/estonia/skonchalsya-professor-tartuskogo-universiteta-leonid-stolovich.d?id=67042744 |title=Скончался профессор Тартуского университета Леонид Столович - Delfi |publisher=Rus.delfi.ee |date= |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stolovich graduated from the [[Leningrad University]] in 1952, from 1953 on he worked at [[Tartu University]], [[Estonia]], from 1994 on as a [[professor emeritus]].
Above all, Stolovich studied [[esthetics]]: its history, theories of esthetics and [[axiology]]. He is the author of more than forty books and 400 publications in 20 languages. 

During the ''[[Perestroika]]'' era, Stolovich took part in the pro-democracy movement ([[Popular Front of Estonia]]). Stolovich’s work “Pluralism in the Philosophy…” decovers 'systematic pluralism', a term coined by Stolovich, which means the unity of dialectical opposites pluralism and monism.

Floridi is best known for his work on two areas of philosophical research: the [[philosophy of information]] and [[information ethics]].

Between 2008 and 2013, he held the Research Chair in [[philosophy of information]] and the [[UNESCO]] Chair in Information and [[Computer Ethics]] at the [[University of Hertfordshire]]. 
He was the founder and director of the IEG,&lt;ref&gt;`[http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/areas/ieg/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; an interdepartmental research group on the philosophy of information at the [[University of Oxford]], and of the GPI&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophyofinformation.net/centre/gpi/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705090440/http://philosophyofinformation.net/centre/gpi/ |date=July 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the research Group in Philosophy of Information at the [[University of Hertfordshire]]. He was the founder and director of the [[:it:SWIF|SWIF]], the Italian e-journal of philosophy (1995–2008). He is a former Governing Body Fellow of [[St Cross College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stx.ox.ac.uk/people/fellow/professor-luciano-floridi |title=St Cross College: Luciano Floridi |publisher=www.stx.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005024934/http://www.stx.ox.ac.uk/people/fellow/professor-luciano-floridi |archivedate=5 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Floridi was born in [[Rome]] in 1964, and studied at Rome University [[La Sapienza]] (Laurea, first class with distinction, 1988), where he was originally educated as a historian of philosophy.&lt;ref name="philosophyofinformation.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophyofinformation.net/pdf/auto.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907203824/http://www.philosophyofinformation.net/pdf/auto.pdf |archivedate=7 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}   Biography, in Italian, from ''Cervelli in Fuga'' (Roma: Accenti, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; He soon became interested in [[analytic philosophy]] and wrote his ''tesi di laurea'' (MA dissertation) in [[philosophy of logic]], on [[Michael Dummett]]'s [[anti-realism]]. He obtained his [[Master of Philosophy]] (1989) and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree (1990) from the [[University of Warwick]], working in [[epistemology]] and [[philosophy of logic]] with [[Susan Haack]] (who was his PhD supervisor) and [[Michael Dummett]]. Floridi's early student years are partly recounted in the non-fiction book ''[[The Lost Painting: The Quest for a Caravaggio Masterpiece]]'', where he was "Luciano". During his graduate and [[postdoctoral]] years, he covered the standard topics in [[analytic philosophy]] in search of a new methodology. He sought to approach contemporary problems from a heuristically powerful and intellectually enriching perspective when dealing with lively philosophical issues. During his graduate studies, he began to distance himself from classical [[analytic philosophy]]. In his view, the analytic movement had lost its way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/SOIS/cipr/floridi_inseit_interview.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705165117/http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/SOIS/cipr/floridi_inseit_interview.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 July 2008|title=INSEIT MEMBER SPOTLIGHT: LUCIANO FLORIDI|date=5 July 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, he worked on [[pragmatism]] (especially [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]]) and foundationalist issues in epistemology and [[philosophy of logic]].

== Academic career ==
He was a Lecturer in Philosophy at the [[University of Warwick]] in 1990-1. He joined the Faculty of Philosophy of the [[University of Oxford]] in 1990 and the [[OUCL]] (Oxford's Department of Computer Science) in 1999. He was [[Junior Research Fellow]] in Philosophy at [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson College]], Oxford University (1990-4), Frances Yates Fellow in the History of Ideas at the [[Warburg Institute]], [[University of London]] (1994–95) and Research Fellow in Philosophy at [[Wolfson College, Oxford]] University (1994-2001). During these years in Oxford, he held lectureships in different Colleges.

Between 2001 and 2006, he was [[Markle Foundation]] Senior Research Fellow in Information Policy at the [[Programme in Comparative Media Law and Policy]], [[Oxford University]].

In his first book, ''Scepticism and the Foundation of Epistemology'', Floridi was already looking for a concept of ''subject-independent knowledge'' close to what he now identifies as semantic ''[[information]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fva-KjwzUk8C&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Scepticism+and+the+Foundation+of+Epistemology&amp;ei=yYoUSv2uNIPGzQTX67HNDw ''Scepticism and the Foundation of Epistemology''].&lt;/ref&gt; During his postdoctoral studies, as a Junior Research Fellow of [[Wolfson College, Oxford]] University, he began to embrace a more Neo-Kantian philosophy, which led him to spend one academic year in [[Marburg]], where he focused on [[Ernst Cassirer]]'s version of [[Neo-Kantianism]].&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.philosophyofinformation.net/pdf/apapaci.pdf Interview for the American Philosophical Association — ''Philosophy And Computing Newsletter''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216120840/http://www.philosophyofinformation.net/pdf/apapaci.pdf |date=16 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began working exclusively on what is now known as the [[philosophy of information]] during his years as Research Fellow, still at Wolfson College.&lt;ref name="philosophyofinformation.net"/&gt;

== Philosophy ==
{{more footnotes|date=July 2012}}
According to Floridi, it is necessary to develop a constructionist philosophy, where design, modelling and implementation replace analysis and dissection. Shifting from one set of tasks to the other, philosophy could then stop retreating into the increasingly small corner of its self-sustaining investigations and hence reacquire a wider view about what really matters. Slowly, Floridi has come to characterise his constructionist philosophy as an innovative field, now known as the [[philosophy of information]], the new area of research that has emerged from the computational/informational turn.

Floridi approaches the [[philosophy of information]] from the perspectives of [[logic]] and epistemology (theoretical), and [[computer science]], [[information technology|IT]] and [[Humanities Computing]] (theoretical).

For example, in the Preface of ''Philosophy and Computing'', published in 1999, he wrote that the book was meant for philosophy students who need IT literacy to use computers efficiently or indispensable background knowledge for the critical understanding of our digital age. The latter provides a basis for the would-be branch of philosophy, the [[philosophy of information]]. PI, or PCI (Philosophy of Computing and Information), became his major research interest.

Floridi's perspective is that there is a need for a broader concept of information, which includes [[computation]], but not only computation. This new framework provides a theoretical framework within which to make sense of various lines of research that have emerged since the fifties. The second advantage is PI’s perspective on the development of philosophy through time. In his view, PI gives us a much wider and more profound perspective on what philosophy might have actually been doing throughout the centuries.
 
Currently, Floridi is working on two areas of research: [[computer ethics]] (see the entry [[information ethics]]) and the concept of [[information]]. Key to this area of work is the claim that ICT ([[Information and Communications Technology]]) is radically [[Reengineering (software)|re-engineering]] or [[ontology|re-ontologizing]] the [[infosphere]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4795">'''Narrative logic''' describes any [[logic]]al process of [[narratology|narrative analysis]] used by readers or viewers to understand and draw conclusions from narratives. Narrative logic is a tool through which the audience may infer actions, events, intentions, thoughts, beliefs, values, and feelings of characters and narrators, or otherwise elucidate details not included in the narrative.  For example, if a character is in Paris in one scene and in Nice the next, the audience can infer that she traveled, and later references to that travel will not be illogical or unexplainable simply because the trip was not explicitly described. In the same way, if a gun is shown in the drawer of a character's desk, the audience can infer that the gun will be or has been used in some way relevant to the plot.  Authors will often play with conventional patterns of narrative logic by attempting to plant "false leads" or to hide important clues, leading audiences to improper conclusions or even to doubt their sense of what is really happening.

It is necessary to build a [[logical argument]] based upon the content of a narrative, using its events and [[rhetoric]] as evidence to infer other elements necessary to produce a coherent and consistent plot, theme, and argument. This is done to ensure that one's argument does not contradict or alter the narrative itself. Problems and disagreements may arise from this fixity of the narrative because it should also preclude alteration of the artistic statement being conveyed, something that is open to subjective interpretation and may be paradoxical or illogical in itself. Thus, this process is generally imperfect since, as with all narrative analysis and most forms of logic, different applications and interpretations can lead to differing conclusions.

Narrative logic becomes explicit or even labored to create [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] where there is a [[plot hole]] or some intentional gap in a narrative, or to explain other unresolved issues within a narrative (i.e. questions such as "Did this character die or simply disappear?" or "Why did two instances under the same circumstances lead to different results?"). It may also be used for other purposes, such as answering theoretical questions derived from the narrative (i.e. "What would happen if...?" or "Who would win in a battle between...?"). In a broader sense it is used in devices such as [[fictional character|character]] development, since a character is defined by the interpretations of its actions and the rhetoric used to describe it.

==Example: Kill Bill: Volume 2==
:

Consider the question of what happens to the character of Elle Driver ([[Daryl Hannah]]) in this movie. At the end of the movie a shot is shown of each of the characters on the Bride's kill list with a caption telling the fate of the character. For Elle Driver the caption reads "???," director [[Quentin Tarantino]] seemingly leaving it up to the audience to decide. Using narrative logic, we take all relevant information from the narrative and come to a conclusion about Driver's fate. Driver is last depicted thrashing about in a trailer, having been blinded by the Bride. This trailer is also occupied by a deadly [[black mamba]], a fact that is emphasized when it is shown poised to strike as the Bride leaves the trailer. Logically, a thrashing, blind woman and threatened snake occupying a confined space would lead most to conclude that Driver falls prey to the snake and is dead at the end of the film. This conclusion may be further supported by taking into consideration the film's rhetorical and artistic devices. The film is largely a tale of deadly vengeance, and the other targets of the Bride are known to be dead at the film's end, thus the ending is better rounded by assuming Driver to likewise be dead. Also, the Bride's codename is Black Mamba, and this same snake killed another of the Bride's targets, so if one presumes the snake is a rhetorical extension of the Bride's wrath, it would most likely strike Driver down while she is vulnerable.
 
However, one may also argue that Driver survived. Again, this conclusion can be supported with logic and analysis of the movie's narrative. The strongest evidence may be the very fact that Driver's fate is left open to question. Another point is that, despite blindness, Driver is still a highly trained professional who would not easily succumb to death by a small reptile.

This example shows how the application of narrative logic may lead to different conclusions using the same evidence. However, these conclusions are similar in that they do not detract from the narrative itself, but only build upon it.

      <comment>A Nikodym set is a kind of set, not a specific one. Bogachev's use of "the" is due to a lack of understanding of definite and indefinite articles because they don't exist in Slavic languages. This is backed up by the Falconer reference. It seems there is no reason to duplicate the definition in the second paragraph, so I have merged it with the first.</comment>

Subsequently, constructions were found of Nikodym sets having continuum many exceptional lines for each point, and [[Kenneth Falconer (mathematician)|Kenneth Falconer]] found analogues in higher dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Falconer|first1=K.

Nikodym sets are closely related to [[Kakeya set]]s (also known as Besicovitch sets).

The existence of Nikodym sets is sometimes compared with the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]]. There is, however, an important difference between the two: the Banach–Tarski paradox relies on non-measurable sets.

Mathematicians have also researched Nikodym sets over [[finite field]]s (as opposed to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Ronald L.|authorlink1=Ronald Graham|authorlink3=Steve Butler (mathematician)|last2=Nešetřil|first2=Jaroslav|last3=Butler|first3=Steve|title=The Mathematics of Paul Erdős I|date=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781461472582|pages=496|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=onG8BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA496|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Ninjō'''|[[wikt:人情|人情]]|"human emotion or compassion"}} in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], is human feeling that complements and opposes the value of [[giri (Japanese)|giri]], or social obligation, within the Japanese worldview.  Broadly speaking, ''ninjō'' is said to be the human feeling that inescapably springs up ''in conflict'' with social obligation.  As ''ninjō'' is a culture-specific term, the validity or importance of this concept is subject to a wide range of viewpoints, inextricably tied into one's perspective on [[nihonjinron]] as a whole.

The classic example of ''ninjō'' is that of a [[samurai]] who falls in love with an unacceptable partner (perhaps somebody of low social class or somebody of an enemy clan).  As a loyal member of his clan, he then becomes torn between the obligation to his feudal lord and his personal feelings, with the only possible resolution being ''[[shinjū]]'' or double love-suicide.  The correspondence to [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' or the [[Aeneid]] would be made by Japanese and non-Japanese alike.  The question of whether modern Japanese still feel a greater sense of giri than their Western counterparts, and thus remain in some ineffable way psychologically closer to this sort of giri-ninjo conflict is precisely where nihonjinron divides into the Japan-centric and Japan-skeptic camps.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28259">{{Gnosticism}}
The '''Ophites''' or '''Ophians''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] Ὀφιανοί ''Ophianoi'', from ὄφις ''ophis'' "snake") were members of a Christian [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] sect depicted by [[Hippolytus of Rome]] (170–235) in a lost work, the ''Syntagma'' ("arrangement").

It is now thought that later accounts of these "Ophites" by [[Pseudo-Tertullian]], [[Philastrius]] and [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] are all dependent on the lost ''Syntagma'' of Hippolytus. It is possible that rather than an actual sectarian name Hippolytus may have invented "Ophite" as a generic term for what he considered heretical speculations concerning the [[Serpents in the Bible|serpent of Genesis]] or [[Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;"In fact, because the Pseudo-Tertullian Ophite entry is the only one in the catalogue that discusses serpents, Hippolytus may well have used 'Ophite' as a generic term for heretical snake speculations in his Syntagma." Rasimus 2007, p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the sources directly dependent on Hippolytus (Pseudo-Tertullian, Philastrius and Epiphanius), Origen and Clement of Alexandria also mention the group. The group is mentioned by [[Irenaeus]] in ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus Haereses]]'' ([http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103130.htm 1:30]).

==Pseudo-Tertullian==
[[File:The Brazen Serpent (crop).jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Nehushtan|Brazen Serpent]] (illustration from a Bible card published 1907 by Providence Lithograph Company)]]

[[Pseudo-Tertullian]] (probably the Latin translation of the lost work ''[[Syntagma of Hippolytus|Syntagma]]'' of Hippolytus, written c. 220) is the earliest source to mention Ophites, and the first source to discuss the connection with serpents. He claims (''Haer''. 2.1-4) that the Ophites taught that

{{quote|Christ did not exist in the flesh (''Christum autem non in substantia carnis fuisse''; 2.4); that they extolled the serpent and preferred it to Christ (''serpentem magnificant in tantum, ut ilium etiam ipsi Christo praeferant''; 2.1); and that Christ imitated (''imitor'') Moses' serpent's sacred power (Num 21:6-9) saying, "And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up (John 3:14)" (''Haer''. 2:1). In addition, Eve is said to have believed the serpent, as if it had been God the Son (''Eua quasi filio deo crediredat''; 2.4).}}

The name "Jesus" is not mentioned in the account. Epiphanius' account differs from that of Pseudo-Tertullian only in a few places. According to the former, the Ophites did not actually prefer the snake to Christ, but thought them identical (''Pan''. 37.1.2; 2.6; 6.5-6; 8.1).&lt;ref&gt;Rasimus 2006, p. 804.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hippolytus==
===''Syntagma''===
This lost earlier treatise of Hippolytus appears to have contained a section on the Ophites, following that on the [[Nicolaitans]], with whom they were brought into connection. [[Philastrius|Philaster]] has mistakenly (obviously) transposed this and two other sections, beginning his treatise on heresies with the Ophites, and making the Ophites, Cainites, and [[Sethians]] pre-Christian sects. The section of Hippolytus appears to have given a condensed account of the mythological story told by Irenaeus. In giving the name Ophite, however, he appears to have brought into greater prominence than Irenaeus the characteristics of the sect indicated by the word, their honour of the serpent, whom they even preferred to Christ, their venerating him because he taught our first parents the knowledge of good and evil, their use of the references to the brazen serpent in the Old and New Testament, and their introduction of the serpent into their [[Eucharist]]ic celebration.

===''Philosophumena''===
{{Main|Naassenes|Peratae|Sethians}}
The great difference between the earlier and the later treatise of Hippolytus is that the former was a mere compilation, his account of the opinions of heresies being in the main derived from the lectures of Irenaeus; but at the time of writing the latter, he had himself read several heretical writings, of which he gives an extract in his treatise. In this book he makes a contemptuous mention of the Ophites in company with the [[Cainites]] and Nochaitae (8:20) as heretics whose doctrines did not deserve the compliment of serious exposition or refutation.

And it is strange that he does not seem to suspect that these heretics have any connection with those who form the subject of his fifth book. In that book he treats of sects which paid honour to the serpent, giving to the first of these sects the name [[Naassenes]], a title which he knows is derived from the [[Hebrew]] word for serpent ("Nahash"-נחש). Possibly Hippolytus restricted the name Ophites to the sect described by Irenaeus, which has very little in common with that which he calls Naassenes. This book contains sections on several other Ophite systems, that of the [[Perates|Peratae]], [[Sethians]] and of Justinus.

==Irenaeus==
===''Against Heresies''===
[[Image:Angelo Bronzino 016.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Agnolo Bronzino]], ''Il serpente di bronzo'', from the chapel of Eleonora of Toledo, [[Firenze]], [[Palazzo Vecchio]]]]

[[Irenaeus]] (died c. 202) gives, in what seems intended for chronological order, a list of heresies, beginning with [[Simon Magus]] and ending with [[Tatian]], and adds in a kind of appendix a description of a variety of Gnostic sects deriving their origin, as Irenaeus maintains, from the heresy of Simon Magus (''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'' [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103123.htm 1:23]-[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103128.htm 28]). This chronology is not considered historically accurate by most modern authors.&lt;ref&gt;Couliano.{{Page needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He details what has been identified by subsequent writers as an Ophite [[cosmogony]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Creation began as a series of [[emanation]]s:

'''The True and Holy Church:'''
*''[[Bythos]]'' (Depth):
**Father of All (the [[Adam Kadmon|First Man]]):
***''Ennoia'', the Son of Man (the Second Man):
****The [[Holy Spirit]], the First Woman:
*****Water
*****Darkness
*****The Abyss
*****[[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]]

Of the beauty of the Holy Spirit, both First and Second Man became enamoured, and they generated from her a third male, an Incorruptible Light, called [[Christ]].

===Sophia===
But the excess of light with which she had been impregnated was more than she could contain, and while Christ her right-hand birth was borne upward with his mother, forming with the First and Second Man the True and Holy Church, a drop of light fell on the left hand downwards into the world of matter, and was called [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]] (Wisdom) or Prunikos, an [[hermaphrodite|androgynous]] being.

By this arrival the still waters were set in motion, all things rushing to embrace the Light, and Prunikos wantonly playing with the waters, assumed to herself a body, without the protection of which the light was in danger of being completely absorbed by matter. Yet when oppressed by the grossness of her surroundings, she strove to escape the waters and ascend to her mother, the body weighed her down, and she could do no more than arch herself above the waters, constituting thus the visible heaven. In process of time, however, by intensity of desire she was able to free herself from the encumbrance of the body, and leaving it behind to ascend to the region immediately above, called in the language of another sect the middle region.

===Ialdabaoth===
Meanwhile a son, Ialdabaoth, born to her from her contact with the waters, having in him a certain breath of the incorruptible light left him from his mother, by means of which he works, generates from the waters a son without any mother. And this son in like manner another, until there were seven [[archon (Gnosticism)|Archons]] in all, ruling the [[seven heavens]];&lt;ref&gt;See also the [[Mithraic]] representations of seven heavens and an eighth region above them ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI/Chapter XXII|''Contra Celsum'' 6:22]]).&lt;/ref&gt; a Hebdomad which their mother completes into an [[Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|Ogdoad]].

*[[Ialdabaoth]] ("yalda bahut" = "son of chaos"), the Demiurge
*[[Archon (Gnosticism)|Iao]]
*[[Sabaoth]]
*[[Adonai]]os
*[[El (deity)|El]]aios
*Astaphanos
*Horaios ("or" = "light")

But it came to pass that these sons strove for mastery with their father Ialdabaoth, whereat he suffered great affliction, and casting his despairing gaze on the dregs of matter below, he, through them, consolidated his longing and obtained a son Ophiomorphus, the serpent-formed [[Nous]], whence come the spirit and soul, and all things of this lower world; but whence came also oblivion, wickedness, jealousy, envy, and death. Ialdabaoth, stretching himself over his upper heaven, had shut out from all below the knowledge that there was anything higher than himself, and having puffed up with pride at the sons whom he had begotten without help from his mother, he cried,
{{cquote|I am Father and God, and above me there is none other.}}
On this his mother, hearing him, cried out ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXX.|1:30, 6]]),
{{cquote|Do not lie, Ialdabaoth, for above thee is the Father of All, the First Man, and the Son of Man.}}
When the heavenly powers marvelled at this voice, Ialdabaoth, to call off their attention, exclaimed, "Let us make man after our image."&lt;ref&gt;This is a direct quotation from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Then the six powers formed a gigantic man, the mother Sophia having given assistance to the design, in order that by this means she might recover the Light-fluid from Ialdabaoth. For the man whom the six powers had formed, lay unable to raise itself, writhing like a worm until they brought it to their father, who breathed into it the breath of life, and so emptied himself of his power. But the man having now Thought and Conception (Nous and Enthymesis), forthwith gave thanks to the First Man, disregarding those who had made him.

[[File:William Blake - The Temptation and Fall of Eve (Illustration to Milton's "Paradise Lost") - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Blake]], ''The Temptation and Fall of Eve'', 1808 (illustration of Milton's ''[[Paradise Lost]]'')]]

At this Ialdabaoth, being jealous, planned to despoil the man by means of a woman, and formed [[Eve]], of whose beauty the six powers being enamoured generated sons from her, namely, the [[angel]]s. Then Sophia devised by means of the serpent to seduce Eve and [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] to transgress the precept of Ialdabaoth; and Eve, accepting the advice of one who seemed a Son of God, persuaded Adam also to eat of the forbidden tree. And when they ate they gained knowledge of the power which is over all, and revoked from those who had made them. Thereupon Ialdabaoth cast Adam and Eve out of Paradise; but the mother had secretly emptied them of the Light-fluid in order that it might not share the curse or reproach. So they were cast down into this world, as was also the serpent who had been detected in working against his father. He brought the angels here under his power, and himself generated six sons, a counterpart of the Hebdomad of which his father was a member. These seven [[demon]]s always oppose and thwart the human race on whose account their father was cast down.

Adam and Eve at first had light and clear and, as it were, spiritual bodies, which on their fall became dull and gross; and their spirits were also languid because they had lost all but the breath of this lower world which their maker had breathed into them; until Prunikos taking pity on them gave them back the sweet odour of the Light-fluid through which they woke to a knowledge of themselves and knew that they were naked. 

The above is clearly a variant of the account of the Creation given in chapter 1 of [[The Book of Genesis]] - but with the major difference that the single, omnipotent God of the original Biblical story is here depicted as Ialdabaoth - one of many Divine beings, and not the most important of them, with his claim to exclusive Godhood described as an arrogant and false usurpation. 

The story proceeds to give a version of [[Old Testament]] history, in which Ialdabaoth is represented as making a series of efforts to obtain exclusive adoration for himself, and to avenge himself on those who refused to pay it, while he is counteracted by Prunikos, who strives to enlighten mankind as to the existence of higher powers more deserving of adoration. In particular the prophets who were each the organ of one of the Hebdomad, the glorification of whom was their main theme, were nevertheless inspired by Sophia to make fragmentary revelations about the First Man and about Christ above, whose descent also she caused to be predicted.

===Redemption===
And here we come to the version given of [[New Testament]] history in this system. Sophia, having no rest either in heaven or on earth, implored the assistance of her mother, the First Woman. She, moved with pity at her daughter's repentance, begged of the First Man that Christ should be sent down to her assistance. Sophia, apprized of the coming help, announced his advent by John, prepared the baptism of repentance, and by means of her son, Ialdabaoth, got ready a woman to receive the annunciation from Christ, in order that when he came there might be a pure and clean vessel to receive him, namely Jesus, who, being born of a virgin by divine power, was wiser, purer, and more righteous than any other man. Christ then descended through the seven heavens, taking the form of the sons of each as he came down, and depriving each of their rulers of his power. For wheresoever Christ came the Light-fluid rushed to him, and when he came into this world he first united himself with his sister Sophia, and they refreshed one another as bridegroom and bride, and the two united descended into Jesus (though never actually dwelling in his flesh), who thus became [[Jesus Christ]]. Then he began to work miracles, and to announce the unknown Father, and to declare himself manifestly the son of the First Man. Then Ialdabaoth and the other princes of the Hebdomad, being angry, sought to have Jesus crucified, but Christ and Sophia did not share his passion, having withdrawn themselves into the incorruptible [[Aeon]]. But Christ did not forget Jesus, but sent a power which raised his body up, not indeed his choical body, for "flesh and blood cannot lay hold of the kingdom of God," but his animal and spiritual body. So it was that Jesus did no miracles, either before his baptism, when he was first united to Christ, or after his resurrection, when Christ had withdrawn himself from him. Jesus then remained on earth after his resurrection eighteen months, at first himself not understanding the whole truth, but enlightened by a revelation subsequently made him, which he taught to a chosen few of his disciples, and then was taken up to heaven.

The story proceeds to tell that Christ, sitting on the right hand of the father Ialdabaoth, without his knowledge enriches himself with the souls of those who had known him, inflicting a corresponding loss on Ialdabaoth. For as righteous souls instead of returning to him are united to Christ, Ialdabaoth is less and less able to bestow any of the Light-fluid on souls afterwards entering this world, and can only breathe into them his own animal breath. The consummation of all things will take place when, by successive union of righteous souls with Christ, the last drop of the Light-fluid shall be recovered from this lower world.

===Significance===
The system here expounded evidently implies a considerable knowledge of the Old Testament on the part either of its inventor or expounder. It begins with "the spirit of God moving on the face of the waters," and it summarises the subsequent history, even mentioning the sacred writers by name. Yet that it is not the work of those amicable to Judaism is evident from the hostility shown to the God of the Jews, who is represented as a mixture of arrogance and ignorance, waging war against idolatry from mere love of self-exaltation, yet constantly thwarted and overcome by the skill of superior knowledge. The feminine attributes ascribed to the Holy Spirit indicate that Greek was not the native language of the framer of this system, and this conclusion is confirmed by the absence of elements derived from Greek philosophic systems. If, for instance, we compare this system with that of [[Valentinianism|Valentinus]], we discover at once so much agreement in essential features as to assure us of the substantial identity of the foundation of the two systems; but the Valentinian system contains several things derived from Greek philosophy, whereas that which we have described can be explained from purely Oriental sources. We are entitled therefore to regard the latter as representing the more original form. The reporter of this system is clearly acquainted with the [[New Testament]], since he adopts a phrase from the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|Epistle to the Corinthians]]; he knows that Jesus habitually spoke of himself as Son of Man; and in denying that Jesus performed miracles before his baptism, he adopts the history as told in the Gospels in opposition to that told in [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal Gospels]] of the Infancy. The place which the doctrine of a Trinity holds in this system is significant.

Although, following Theodoret, we have given the name Ophite to the system described by Irenaeus, it will have been seen that the doctrine concerning the serpent forms a very subordinate part of the system. In the passage immediately following the chapter we have analysed, Irenaeus shows acquaintance with a section of the school who may be called Ophite in the proper sense of the word, some teaching that Sophia herself was the serpent, some glorifying [[Cain]] and other enemies of the God of the Old Testament.

If we were to single out what we regard as the most characteristic feature of the scheme, it is the prominence given to the attribute of light as the property of the good Principle. This feature is still more striking in the derived system of ''[[Pistis Sophia]]'', where the mention of light is of perpetual occurrence, and the dignity of every being is measured by the brilliancy of its light.

In the section of Irenaeus immediately preceding that of which we have just given an account, there is a summary of a system which has been called Barbeliot, from its use of the name [[Barbelo]] to denote the supreme female principle. It contains some of the essential features of the scheme just described, of which it seems to have been a development, principally characterized by a great wealth of nomenclature, and, with the exception of the name which has given a title to the system, all derived from the [[Greek language]].

==Clement of Alexandria==
[[Clement of Alexandria]] (c. 150-c. 215) incidentally mentions [[Cainites]] and Ophites, (''Stromata'' 7:17) but gives no explanation of their tenets. Nor do we suppose that there is any reason to connect with this sect his reprobation of the use of serpent ornaments by women (''Instructor'' 2:13).

==Origen==
[[File:Ophitediagram-matter.png|thumb|320px|right|Reconstruction of Ophite Diagram from ''Histoire critique du Gnosticisme;'' Jacques Matter, 1826, Vol. III, Plate I, D.]]
[[Origen]] (c. 185–254) is led to speak of the Ophites ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI/Chapter XXVIII|''Contra Celsum'' 6:28]]) by an accusation of [[Celsus]] that the Christians counted seven heavens, and spoke of the Creator as an accursed divinity, inasmuch as he was worthy of execration for cursing the serpent who introduced the first human beings to the knowledge of good and evil. Origen replies that Celsus had mixed up matters, and had confounded with the Christians the Ophites, who so far from being Christians would not hear the name of Jesus, nor own him to have been so much as a wise and virtuous man, nor would admit anyone into their assembly until he had cursed Jesus. It may be doubted whether Origen has not here been misinformed about a sect of which he intimates that he knows but little. According to all other authorities the Ophites claimed to be Christians. Elsewhere Origen classes the Ophites as heretics of the graver sort with the followers of [[Marcion of Sinope|Marcion]], [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]], [[Basilides]], and [[Apelles (gnostic)|Apelles]] (''Commentary on Matthew'' 3:852). The identity of the nomenclature shows that for Origen, these Ophites of Origen are a branch of the unnamed sect described by Irenaeus.

===Hebdomad===
The names of the seven princes of the Hebdomad, as given by Origen, agree completely with the list of Irenaeus ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI/Chapter XXXI|''Contra Celsum'' 6:31]]). Origen also gives the names of the seven demons. Irenaeus only gives the name of their chief, but that one is enough to establish a more than accidental coincidence, since it is a name we should not have expected to find as the name of a demon, namely, [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]]. The name Prunikos is also found in the report of Origen. Origen gives what must have been one of the valuable secrets of this sect, viz. the formula to be addressed by an ascending soul to each of the princes of the hebdomad in order to propitiate him to grant a passage through his dominions. Perhaps the secret would have been more jealously guarded if it were not that in addition to the use of the formula, it seems to have been necessary to produce at each gate a certain symbol. These would only be in the possession of the initiated, and we may imagine that they were buried with them. He gives the formulae in the inverse order; i.e. first the formula to be used by a soul which has passed through the highest heaven and desires to enter the Ogdoad; next the formula to be used in order to gain admission to the highest heaven, and so on.

===Diagrams===
{{Main|Ophite Diagrams}}
Origen also gives a description of an [[Ophite Diagrams|Ophite diagram]], which Celsus likewise had met with, consisting of an outer circle, named [[Leviathan]], denoting the soul of all things, with ten internal circles, variously coloured, the diagram containing also the figures and names of the seven demons. Many have attempted to reproduce the figure from Origen's description, but in truth Origen has not given us particulars enough to enable us to make a restoration with confidence, or even to enable us to understand what was intended to be represented. Origen names Euphrates as the introducer of the doctrine of the sect which he describes, and the sect may have been that branch of the Ophites who are called [[Perates|Peratae]].

==Epiphanius==
{{quote|They have a snake, which they keep in a certain chest—the ''[[cista mystica]]''—and which at the hour of their mysteries they bring forth from its cave. They heap loaves upon the table and summon the serpent. Since the cave is open it comes out. It is a cunning beast and, knowing their foolish ways, it crawls up on the table and rolls in the loaves; this they say is the perfect sacrifice. Wherefore, as I have been told, they not only break the bread in which the snake has rolled and administer it to those present, but each one kisses the snake on the mouth, for the snake has been tamed by a spell, or has been made gentle for their fraud by some other diabolical method. And they fall down before it and call this the Eucharist, consummated by the beast rolling in the loaves. And through it, as they say, they send forth a hymn to the Father on high, thus concluding their mysteries.| ''[[Panarion]]'' 1:37&lt;ref&gt;Campbell and Abadie, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ophite teaching was, most likely, dying out in the days of Hippolytus; in the time of Epiphanius it was not absolutely extinct, but the notices in his work would lead us to think of it as but the eccentric doctrine of some stray heretic here and there, and not to have counted many adherents. In the 5th century Theodoret tells (''Heresies'' 1:24) of having found serpent worship practised in his diocese by people whom he calls [[Marcion]]ites, but whom we may believe to have been really Ophites.

==Nag Hammadi texts==
Of the [[Nag Hammadi]] Gnostic texts that mention the serpent, three appear related to early church accounts of the Ophites. These texts are ''[[Hypostasis of the Archons]], [[On the Origin of the World]],'' and the ''[[Apocryphon of John]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Of the Nag Hammadi texts that speak of the serpent three are clearly related to heresiologists' Ophite accounts. These texts are ''Hyp. Arch., Orig. World,'' and ''Ap. John''." Rasimus 2007, p. 450.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Emulation==
[[Our Lady of Endor Coven]], a cult established in 1948, was strongly influenced by the teachings of the ancient Ophites, as given in the above sources.

==Essence of epistemology==

* [[Descriptive knowledge]] ("knowledge that")
* [[Scientific method]]
* [[Truth]]

== Branches of epistemology ==

* [[Alethiology]] &amp;ndash;  the study of the nature of truth
* [[Formal epistemology]] &amp;ndash; subdiscipline of [[epistemology]] that uses [[formal methods]] from [[logic]], [[probability theory]] and [[computability theory]] to elucidate traditional epistemic problems.
* [[Meta-epistemology]] &amp;ndash; [[metaphilosophical]] study of the subject, matter, [[philosophical method|methods]] and aims of [[epistemology]] and of approaches to understanding and structuring our knowledge of knowledge itself.
* [[Social epistemology]]

== Epistemological theories ==
===Justification===
* [[Theory of justification|Theories of justification]]
** [[Foundationalism]] &amp;ndash; Self-evident basic beliefs justify other non-basic beliefs.
** [[Coherentism]] &amp;ndash; Beliefs are justified if they cohere with other beliefs a person holds, each belief is justified if it coheres with the overall system of beliefs.
** [[Internalism]] &amp;ndash; The believer must be able to justify a belief through internal knowledge.
** [[Externalism]] &amp;ndash; Outside sources of knowledge can be used to justify a belief.
** [[Philosophical skepticism#Epistemology and skepticism|Skepticism]] &amp;ndash; A variety of viewpoints questioning the possibility of knowledge.
*** [[Academic skepticism]] &amp;ndash; A school of skepticism which rejects the existence of truth and maintains that knowledge is impossible.
*** [[Pyrrhonian skepticism]] &amp;ndash; A school of skepticism which emphasises suspension of belief to attain [[ataraxia#Pyrrhonism|ataraxia]] (tranquility of mind).
** Minority viewpoints include:
*** [[Foundherentism]] &amp;ndash; A combination of foundationalism and coherentism proposed by [[Susan Haack]].
*** [[Infinitism]] &amp;ndash; Beliefs are justified by infinite chains of reasons, as proposed by [[Peter D. Klein]].
* [[Theory of justification#Justifiers|Common justifiers]]
** [[Scientific method]] &amp;ndash; body of [[Scientific technique|technique]]s for investigating [[phenomenon|phenomena]], acquiring new&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldhaber|Nieto|2010|page=940}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[knowledge]], or correcting and integrating previous knowledge.  A scientific method consists of the collection of [[data]] through [[observation]] and [[experiment]]ation, and the formulation and testing of [[hypotheses]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/scientific%20method scientific method], ''[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Occam's Razor]] &amp;ndash; the principle that "entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity" (''entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem''). The popular interpretation of this principle is that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one. However, this is often confused, as the 'simple' "is really referring to the theory with the fewest new assumptions." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theness.com/the-razor-in-the-toolbox/ The NESS: The Razor in the Toolbox]&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Empiricism]] &amp;ndash; theory of [[knowledge]] that asserts that knowledge arises from [[evidence]] gathered via [[Empirical evidence|sense experience]].  Empiricism emphasizes the role of [[experience]] and [[evidence]], especially [[sensory perception]], in the formation of ideas, over the notion of [[innate idea]]s or [[tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Baird | first = Forrest E. | authorlink = |author2=Walter Kaufmann | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2008 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-158591-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Induction (philosophy)|Induction]] &amp;ndash; kind of [[reasoning]] that allows for the possibility that the conclusion is false even where all of the premises are true.&lt;ref&gt;John Vickers. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/ The Problem of Induction]. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; The premises of an inductive [[logical argument]] indicate some degree of support (inductive probability) for the conclusion but do not [[entailment|entail]] it; i.e. they do not ensure its truth.
** [[Pragmatism]] &amp;ndash; philosophical movement that includes those who claim that an ideology or [[proposition]] is true if it works satisfactorily, that the meaning of a proposition is to be found in the practical consequences of accepting it, and that impractical ideas are to be rejected.
** [[Probability theory]] &amp;ndash; branch of [[mathematics]] concerned with analysis of [[Statistical randomness|random]] phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9375936 Probability theory, Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; The central objects of probability theory are [[random variable]]s, [[stochastic process]]es, and [[event (probability theory)|event]]s: mathematical abstractions of [[determinism|non-deterministic]] events or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or evolve over time in an ''apparently'' random fashion.  If repeated many times the sequence of random events will exhibit certain statistical patterns, which can be studied and predicted.
** [[Abductive Reasoning]] or [[Inference to the Best Explanation]] &amp;ndash; kind of logical inference described by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] as the process of arriving at an explanatory hypothesis.  Thus, to abduce a hypothetical explanation &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; as a conclusion from a noticed curious circumstance &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; as a premise, is to surmise that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; may be true because then &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; would be a matter of course.&lt;ref name=HL&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1903), Harvard lectures on pragmatism, ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, [http://www.textlog.de/7664-2.html paragraphs 188–189].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pay it forward''' is an expression for describing the beneficiary of a good deed repaying it to others instead of to the original benefactor.

The concept is old, but the phrase may have been coined by Lily Hardy Hammond in her 1916 book ''In the Garden of Delight''.&lt;ref name=Hammond&gt;{{cite book |first=Lily Hardy |last=Hammond |title=In the Garden of Delight |publisher=[[Thomas Y. Crowell Co.]] |location=New York |year=1916 |page=209 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rjweAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA209 |archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/InTheGardenOfDelight |archivedate=October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Pay it forward" is implemented in contract law of [[loan]]s in the concept of [[third party beneficiaries]]. Specifically, the creditor offers the debtor the option of paying the debt forward by lending it to a [[third party beneficiary|third person]] instead of paying it back to the original creditor. This contract may include the provision that the debtor may repay the debt [[in kind]], lending the same amount to a similarly disadvantaged party once they have the means, and under the same conditions. Debt and payments can be monetary or by good deeds. A related type of transaction, which starts with a gift instead of a loan, is [[alternative giving]].

==History==
Pay it forward was used as a key plot element in the [[wikt:dénouement#Noun|denouement]] of a [[New Comedy]] play by [[Menander]], ''[[Dyskolos]]'' (a title which can be translated as "The Grouch"). ''Dyskolos'' was a prizewinning play in ancient Athens in 317 BC; however, the text of the play was lost and it was only  recovered and republished in 1957.

The concept was rediscovered and described by [[Benjamin Franklin]], in a [[s:Franklin to Benjamin Webb|letter to Benjamin Webb]] dated April 25, 1784:&lt;ref name="BenFranklinAutobiography"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Franklin|first1=Benjamin|title=Autobiography|date=1917|publisher=Macmillan|page=241|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1XFXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA241#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|I do not pretend to [[gift|give]] such a deed; I only [[loan|lend]] it to you. When you [...] meet with another honest Man in similar Distress, you must pay me by lending this Sum to him; enjoining him to discharge the Debt by a like operation, when he shall be able, and shall meet with another opportunity. I hope it may thus go thro' many hands, before it meets with a Knave that will stop its Progress. This is a trick of mine for doing a deal of good with a little money.}}

[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], in his 1841 essay [[Compensation (essay)|''Compensation'']],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emersoncentral.com/compensation.htm Ralph Waldo Emerson, ''Compensation'', 1841, (text of Emerson essay)]&lt;/ref&gt; wrote: "In the order of nature we cannot render benefits to those from whom we receive them, or only seldom. But the benefit we receive must be rendered again, line for line, deed for deed, cent for cent, to somebody."

In 1916, Lily Hardy Hammond wrote, "You don't pay love back; you pay it forward."&lt;ref name=Hammond /&gt;

[[Wayne Woodrow Hayes|Woody Hayes]] (February 14, 1913 – March 12, 1987) was a college football coach who is best remembered for winning five national titles and 13 Big Ten championships in 28 years at [[The Ohio State University]]. He misquoted Emerson as having said "You can pay back only seldom. You can always pay forward, and you must pay line for line, deed for deed, and cent for cent." He also shortened the (mis)quotation into "You can never pay back; but you can always pay forward" and variants.&lt;ref name="CoachWoodyHayes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greene|first1=Bob|title=You can always pay forward.|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-01-03/features/9501030136_1_mrs-ballard-woody-hayes-ohio-state|website=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Woody Hayes: Sport Motivational Advice from the Commencement Speech at Ohio State University|url=http://www.graduationwisdom.com/speeches/0022-hayes.htm|website=GraduationWisdom.com|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1929 novel, ''[[Magnificent Obsession]]'', by [[Lloyd C. Douglas]], also espoused this philosophy, in combination with the concept that good deeds should be performed in confidence.

===Robert Heinlein's contribution===

The term "pay it forward" was popularized by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] in his book ''[[Between Planets]]'', published in 1951:

{{quotation|The banker reached into the folds of his gown, pulled out a single credit note. "But eat first—a full belly steadies the judgment. Do me the honor of accepting this as our welcome to the newcomer."

His pride said no; his stomach said YES! Don took it and said, "Uh, thanks! That's awfully kind of you. I'll pay it back, first chance."

"Instead, pay it forward to some other brother who needs it."}}

Heinlein both preached and practiced this philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Today, the [[Heinlein Society]], a humanitarian organization founded in his name, practices it in the form of various programs such as blood drives, free educational CDs for teachers, and US$500 scholarships.&lt;ref name="hsforward"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heinleinsociety.org/pay-it-forward/ | title=Pay It Forward | publisher=The Heinlein Society | accessdate=February 8, 2018 | quote=The most important aspect of Robert Heinlein’s legacy that we at The Heinlein Society support and adhere to is his concept of paying it forward.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Author [[Spider Robinson]] made repeated reference to the doctrine, attributing it to his spiritual mentor Heinlein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.heinleinsociety.org/CentennialReader/heinleinsociety.html |title = The Heinlein Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}}

Heinlein was a mentor to [[Ray Bradbury]], giving him help and quite possibly passing on the concept, made famous by the publication of a letter from him to Heinlein thanking him. In Bradbury's novel ''[[Dandelion Wine]]'', published in 1957, when the main character Douglas Spaulding is reflecting on his life being saved by Mr. Jonas, the Junkman:

{{quotation|How do I thank Mr. Jonas, he wondered, for what he's done?  How do I thank him, how pay him back? No way, no way at all. You just can't pay. What then? What? Pass it on somehow, he thought, pass it on to someone else. Keep the chain moving. Look around, find someone, and pass it on. That was the only way....}}

Bradbury has also advised that writers he has helped thank him by helping other writers.

Some time in 1980, a sixteen-page supplemental [[Marvel Comics|Marvel comic]] appeared in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' entitled “What Price a Life?” and was subsequently reprinted as the backup story in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #126 dated February, 1983. This was a team-up between [[Spider-Man]] and [[The Incredible Hulk]], in which Spider-Man helps the Hulk escape from police who mistakenly thought that he was attacking them. Afterwards, they meet in their secret identities, with [[Peter Parker]] warning [[Bruce Banner]] to leave town because of the Hulk’s seeming attack on police. But Banner is flat broke, and cannot afford even bus fare. As a result, Parker gives Banner his last $5 bill, saying that someone had given him money when he was down on his luck, and this was how he was repaying that debt. Later, in Chicago, the Hulk confronts muggers who had just robbed an elderly retired man of his pension money, all the money he had. After corralling the muggers, the Hulk turns towards the victim. The retiree thinks that the Hulk is about to attack him as well, but instead, the Hulk gives him the $5 bill. It transpires that the very same old man had earlier given a down-on-his-luck Peter Parker a $5 bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Sjoerdsma |first = Al |title = Review of "What Price a Life?" |url = http://spiderfan.org/comics/reviews/spiderman_promo_newspaper/price_chicago.html |work = ComicBoards.com |publisher = SpiderFan.org |accessdate = 6 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Catherine Ryan Hyde]]'s novel ''[[Pay It Forward (novel)|Pay It Forward]]'' was published and adapted into a [[Pay It Forward (film)|film of the same name]], distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] and starring [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Helen Hunt]] and [[Haley Joel Osment]]. In Ryan Hyde's book and movie it is described as an obligation to do three good deeds for others in response to a good deed that one receives. Such good deeds should accomplish things that the other person cannot accomplish on their own. In this way, the practice of helping one another can spread geometrically through [[society]], at a ratio of three to one, creating a [[social movement]] with an impact of making the world a better place.

The Pay it Forward Movement and Foundation&lt;ref name=PIFF&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.payitforwardfoundation.org/ |work=Pay It Forward Foundation |title=HOME |publisher= |accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in the USA helping start a ripple effect of kindness acts around the world. The newly appointed president of the foundation, Charley Johnson, had an idea for encouraging kindness acts by having a Pay it Forward Bracelet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pifexperience.org/ |title=Web hosting provider - Bluehost.com - domain hosting - PHP Hosting - cheap web hosting - Frontpage Hosting E-Commerce Web Hosting Bluehost|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that could be worn as a reminder. Since then, over a million Pay it Forward bracelets have been distributed in over 100 countries sparking acts of kindness. Few bracelets remain with their original recipients, however, as they circulate in the spirit of the reciprocal or generalized altruism.

In 2007, International [http://www.payitforwardday.com Pay it Forward Day] was founded in Australia by Blake Beattie. It has now spread to 70 countries with over 50 state and city proclamations. It is estimated that it has inspired over 5 million acts of kindness and has featured on 7, 9, 10, ABC, NBC, Fox 5, Fox 8 and [[Global News]] in Canada.

On April 5, 2012, [[WBRZ-TV]], the [[American Broadcasting Company]] affiliate for the city of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], [[Louisiana]], did a story on The Newton Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenewtonproject.com |title=The Newton Project|publisher=|accessdate=2018-01-31 | deadurl=usurped| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160111205312/http://thenewtonproject.com/| archive-date= 11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 501(c)(3) outreach organization created to demonstrate that regardless of how big the problems of the world may seem, each person can make a difference simply by taking the time to show love, appreciation and kindness to the people around them. It is based on the classic pay-it-forward concept, but demonstrates the impact of each act on the world by tracking each wristband with a unique ID number and quantifying the lives each has touched. The Newton Project’s attempt to quantify the benefits of a Pay It Forward type system can be viewed by the general public at their website.

Inspired by [[John F. Kennedy]] who profoundly declared, "Let us think of education as the means of developing our greatest abilities, because in each of us there is a private hope and dream which, fulfilled, can be translated into benefit for everyone and greater strength for our nation", The Student Body of America Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studentbodyofamerica.org |title=Home |work=Project Pay It Forward| date=20 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[501(c)3]] nonprofit organization, has initiated its Project Pay it Forward&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectpayitforward.org/|title=Home|first=Project Pay It|last=Forward|date=20 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; program to implement education with the pay-it-forward concept.

Businesses have also adopted the concept as part of their [[organizational culture|corporate culture.]] [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo, N.D.]]-based [[Bell Bank]] started a Pay It Forward program in 2007, inspired by [[Oprah Winfrey]]’s “Pay It Forward” project.&lt;ref name="inforum.com"&gt;The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead, December 18, 2007 http://www.inforum.com/content/state-banks-pay-it-forward-initiative-receiving-worldwide-media-attention&lt;/ref&gt; The program gives full-time employees $1,000 and part-time employees $500 each year to give to people and organizations in need.&lt;ref name="bmag.bushfoundation.org"&gt;Bush Foundation http://bmag.bushfoundation.org/buzz/who-michael-solberg&lt;/ref&gt; Employees are also given $1,000 to give to a customer, vendor or community member to donate to someone else.&lt;ref name="bmag.bushfoundation.org"/&gt; The program has given out more than $8 million so far.&lt;ref&gt;Northwestern Financial Review, June 1, 2016 http://www.northwesternfinancialreview.com/issue/northwestern-financial-review/article/bell-state-bank-rings-in-50th-anniversary&lt;/ref&gt;

After launching the program, Michael Solberg, [[Bell Bank]]’s president and CEO, appeared on a number of news outlets to talk about it, including ''[[Good Morning America]]'', [[CBS]]’s ''[[The Early Show]]'', [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]&lt;ref name="inforum.com"/&gt; and ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' with [[Katie Couric]].&lt;ref&gt;The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead, January 10, 2008 http://www.inforum.com/content/banks-pay-it-forward-effort-be-featured-cbs-news&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raya Dunayevskaya''', born '''Raya Shpigel''' ({{lang-ru|Ра́я Шпи́гель}}; May 1, 1910 &amp;ndash; June 9, 1987), later '''Rae Spiegel''', also known by the pseudonym '''Freddie Forest''', was the [[United States|American]] founder of the [[philosophy]] of [[Marxist Humanism]] in the United States. At one time [[Leon Trotsky]]'s secretary, she later split with him and ultimately founded the organization [[News and Letters Committees]] and was its leader until her death.

==Biography==
Of Jewish descent, Dunayevskaya was born Raya Shpigel in today's [[Ukraine]] and emigrated to the United States (her name changed to Rae Spiegel) and joined the revolutionary movement in her childhood. Active in the [[American Communist Party]] youth organization, she was expelled at age 18 and thrown down a flight of stairs when she suggested that her local comrades should find out Trotsky's response to his expulsion from the [[Soviet Communist Party]] and the [[Comintern]]. By the following year she found a group of independent Trotskyists in [[Boston]], led by [[Antoinette Buchholz Konikow]], an advocate of [[birth control]] and legal [[abortion]].&lt;ref name="Women Building Chicago, p. 239"&gt;''Women Building Chicago'', p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, she adopted her mother's maiden name Dunayevskaya.&lt;ref&gt;''Urbane Revolutionary: C. L. R. James and the Struggle for a New Society'', Frank Rosengarten, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Without getting permission from the U.S. Trotskyist organization, she went to [[Mexico]] in 1937 to serve as [[Leon Trotsky]]'s Russian language secretary during his [[exile]] there.&lt;ref name="Women Building Chicago, p. 239"/&gt; Having returned to Chicago in 1938 after the deaths of her father and brother, she broke with Trotsky in 1939 when he continued to maintain that the [[Soviet Union]] was a "[[workers' state]]" even after the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]]. She opposed any notion that workers should be asked to defend this "workers' state" allied with [[Nazi Germany]] in a [[world war]]. Along with theorists such as [[C. L. R. James]], and later [[Tony Cliff]], Dunayevskaya argued that the Soviet Union had become '[[state capitalist]]'. Toward the end of her life, she stated that what she called "my real development" only began after her break with Trotsky.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Literary Review'', "Marxist-Humanism, an Interview with Raya Dunayevskaya," p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her simultaneous study of the Russian economy and of Marx's early writings (later known as the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]''), led to her theory that not only was the [[U.S.S.R.]] a '[[state capitalist]]' society, but that '[[state capitalism]]' was a new world stage. Much of her initial analysis was published in ''The New International'' in 1942-1943.

In 1940, she was involved in the split in the [[Socialist Workers Party (US)|Socialist Workers Party]] that led to the formation of the [[Workers Party (US)|Workers Party]] (WP), with which she shared an objection to Trotsky's characterisation of the Soviet Union as a '[[degenerated workers' state]]'. Within the WP, she formed the [[Johnson–Forest Tendency]] alongside [[C. L. R. James]] (she being "Freddie Forest" and he "J.R. Johnson", named for their party cadre names). The tendency argued that the Soviet Union was '[[state capitalism|state capitalist]]', while the WP majority maintained that it was [[bureaucratic collectivist]].

Differences within the WP steadily widened, and in 1947, after a brief period of independent existence during which they published a series of documents, the tendency returned to the ranks of the SWP. Their membership in the SWP was based on a shared insistence that there was a pre-revolutionary situation just around the corner, and the shared belief that a [[Leninist]] party must be in place to take advantage of the coming opportunities.

By 1951, with the failure of their shared perspective to materialize, the tendency developed a theory that rejected [[Leninism]] and saw the workers as being spontaneously revolutionary. This was borne out for them by the 1949 U.S. miners' strike. In later years, they were to pay close attention to [[automation]], especially in the [[automobile industry]], which they came to see as paradigmatic of a new stage of [[capitalism]]. This led to the tendency leaving the SWP again to begin independent work.

After more than a decade of developing the theory of [[state capitalism]], Dunayevskaya continued her study of the Hegelian [[dialectic]] by taking on a task the Johnson–Forest Tendency had set itself: exploring [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel's]] ''[[Philosophy of Mind]]''. In 1954 she initiated a decades long correspondence with the Critical Theorist, Herbert Marcuse, in which the necessity and freedom dialectic in Hegel and Marx became a focal point of contention.http://marxist-humanistdialectics.blogspot.com/2018/03/coming-out-in-may-necessity-and-freedom.html She advanced an interpretation of Hegel's [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolutes]] holding that they involved a dual movement: a movement from practice that is itself a form of theory and a movement from theory reaching to philosophy. She considered these 1953 letters to be "the philosophic moment" from which the whole development of [[Marxist Humanism]] flowed.

In 1953 Dunayevskaya moved to Detroit, where she was to live until 1984. In 1954-1955 she and C. L. R. James engaged in a split{{clarify|date=December 2014}}. In 1955, she founded her own organization, [[News and Letters Committees]], and a Marxist-Humanist newspaper, ''[[News &amp; Letters]]'', which remains in publication today. The newspaper covers women's struggles, the liberation of workers, people of color, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual rights and the disability rights movement, while not separating that coverage from philosophical and theoretical articles. The organization split in 2008-9 and the U.S. Marxist-Humanists (later to become the [http://www.internationalmarxisthumanist.org/ International Marxist-Humanist Organization]) was formed.

Dunayevskaya wrote what came to be known as her "trilogy of revolution": ''[[Marxism and Freedom: From 1776 Until Today]]'' (1958), ''[[Philosophy and Revolution]]'' (1973), and ''[[Rosa Luxemburg, Women's Liberation, and Marx's Philosophy of Revolution]]'' (1982).  In addition, she selected and introduced a collection of writings, published in 1985, ''Women's Liberation and the Dialectics of Revolution''.

In the last year of her life she was working on a new book which she had tentatively titled, ''Dialectics of Organization and Philosophy: The 'Party' and Forms of Organization Born Out of Spontaneity''.&lt;ref&gt;Many of her writings that were part of the process of work on the projected book are included in Volume XIII of the Supplement to the Raya Dunayevskaya Collection.&lt;/ref&gt;

Raya Dunayevskaya's speeches, letters, publications, notes, recordings and other items are located in the Walter P. Reuther Library at [[Wayne State University]] in [[Detroit]]. Microfilm copies of the collection are available from the WSU Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs. Guides to the collection are available from News and Letters Committees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9227">'''Richard Laughton''' (1670?–1723)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=16124|title=Laughton, Richard|first=John|last=Gascoigne}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an English churchman and academic, now known as a [[natural philosopher]] and populariser of the ideas of [[Isaac Newton]].

==Early life==
Originally from London, he was educated at [[Clare College, Cambridge]], where he was admitted as a [[sizar]] in 1680. He graduated B.A. in 1685, proceeded M.A. in 1691, and was created D.D. by mandate in 1717.&lt;ref name="Venn"&gt;{{acad|LTN680R|Laughton, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Laughton, Richard|volume=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 1693 Laughton was chaplain to [[John Moore (bishop of Ely)|John Moore]], the [[bishop of Norwich]]. In 1694 he was appointed tutor of his college, and in this capacity he acquired a reputation. [[John Colbatch]], in his commemoration sermon preached in Trinity College Chapel, 17 December 1717, said of Laughton "We see what a conflux of nobility and gentry the virtue of one man draws daily to one of our least colleges".&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; More colloquially, he was called a "pupil-monger".&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter William Rouse Ball]], ''A History of the Study of Mathematics at Cambridge'' (1889), pp. 75–6, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofstudyof00ballrich#page/74/mode/2up archive.org.]&lt;/ref&gt; Among his pupils were [[Martin Folkes]], [[Benjamin Ibbot]], and [[Robert Greene (philosopher)|Robert Greene]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=11419|title=Greene, Robert|first=John|last=Gascoigne}}&lt;/ref&gt; He encouraged the study of Newton's ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''.&lt;ref name="Ellis2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Heather Ellis|title=Generational Conflict and University Reform: Oxford in the Age of Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ldPsLBkV1LUC&amp;pg=PA29|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=3 August 2012|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-22552-7|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In politics Laughton was a Whig. He had the backing of [[Simon Patrick]], the [[bishop of Ely]], in college matters, who wrote to the Master of Clare, Samuel Blythe, on his behalf in 1697.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Gascoigne|title=Cambridge in the Age of the Enlightenment: Science, Religion and Politics from the Restoration to the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QmwqzdMsRkC&amp;pg=PA86|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=18 July 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52497-1|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Moore, who succeeded Patrick in the see, acted in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;John Gascoigne, ''Politics, Patronage and Newtonianism: The Cambridge Example'', The Historical Journal Vol. 27, No. 1 (Mar., 1984), pp. 1-24, at p. 13. Published by: Cambridge University Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2639340&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proctor==
Laughton became vicar of [[Stow-cum-Quy]] in 1709.&lt;ref name="Venn"/&gt; He was a supporter of the Newtonian philosophy; and when in 1710–1711 he had as [[senior proctor]] to appoint a moderator for the examinations, he took on the duty himself. He brought forward questions on the Newtonian theory; and divided candidates into two classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Linehan|title=St John's College Cambridge: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHir3e7Y_jUC&amp;pg=PA189|accessdate=30 May 2013|year=2011|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=978-1-84383-608-7|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the history of the [[Tripos]], his attention to the provisions of Elizabethan statutes allowing M.A.'s to question the B.A. candidates is considered another factor in the development of a differentiated examination system.&lt;ref name="Ellis2012"/&gt;

[[Samuel Clarke]], in the preface to his edition of [[Jacques Rohault]]'s treatise on Physics, acknowledged his obligation to Laughton. [[W. W. Rouse Ball]] thought that Laughton was a significant influence on Clarke, who offered a Newtonian proposition in 1711. It is now argued that [[John Ellys (Caius)|John Ellys]] is the likely source in this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Gascoigne|title=Cambridge in the Age of the Enlightenment: Science, Religion and Politics from the Restoration to the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QmwqzdMsRkC&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=18 July 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52497-1|pages=143–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laughton did induce [[William Browne (physician)|William Browne]], of [[Peterhouse]], to tackle a mathematical question.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Wordsworth, ''Scholae academicae: some account of the studies at the English Universities in the eighteenth century'' (1877) p. 58; [https://archive.org/stream/scholaeacademica00word#page/58/mode/2up archive.org.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[William Whiston]] called Laughton a friend and excellent tutor; and recorded his  vain efforts to turn him back from his adoption of [[Arianism]]. It was to Laughton that [[Lady Masham]] addressed a well-known letter describing the closing scene of [[John Locke]]'s life.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Laughton was on close terms with [[Richard Bentley]]. He met [[Conrad von Uffenbach]], who visited Cambridge in 1710. That year he was, as proctor, a prominent reformer of academic discipline; his efforts involved him in clashes with  other leading members of the university, including [[Conyers Middleton]] and [[Thomas Gooch]], who found him officious.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; Laughton's targets included [[Stourbridge fair]] and [[coffee house]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Eyton Bickersteth Mayor]], ''Cambridge under Queen Anne: illustrated by memoir of Ambrose Bonwicke and diaries of Francis Burman and Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach'' (1911), p. 419; [https://archive.org/stream/cambridgeunderqu00mayoiala#page/418/mode/2up archive.org.]&lt;/ref&gt; He also closed clubs and broke up gatherings at taverns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[James Henry Monk]]|title=The Life of Richard Bentley, D.D.: Master of Trinity College, and Regius Professor of Divinity in the University of Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0UoJAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA286|accessdate=30 May 2013|year=1833|publisher=J. G. &amp; F. Rivington|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident with Middleton was a party at the Rose Tavern, and involved drinking the health of the high Tory [[Henry Sacheverell]] on 3 July 1710, which Laughton reported to the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Middleton, Conyers|volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political atmosphere ahead of the [[British general election, 1710|general election of October 1710]] was fraught: Laughton was a known Whig militant, and his action brought a tit-for-tat reprisal by Tories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/constituencies/cambridge-university historyofparliamentonline.org, ''Cambridge University 1690–1715''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1713 Laughton was an unsuccessful candidate for the mastership of his college, in an election that saw political tensions in Clare itself. Robert Greene, his former pupil, made clear his Tory allegiance. William Grigg was elected; in fact both he and Laughton were allies of Bentley and his reformist programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David B. Ruderman|title=Jewish enlightenment in an English key: Anglo-Jewry's construction of modern Jewish thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=30kN_nSt2sUC&amp;pg=PA195|accessdate=30 May 2013|year=2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-04883-3|pages=195–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking on [[George Parker, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield|George Parker]] as pupil in 1715, Laughton also reported to his father [[Thomas Parker, 1st Earl of Macclesfield|Lord Parker]], the prominent Whig, on university politics. Laughton and Parker's agent Thomas Bell were heavily involved in supporting candidates for head of house, such as [[John Davies (Queens')|John Davies]] of Queens'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Gascoigne|title=Cambridge in the Age of the Enlightenment: Science, Religion and Politics from the Restoration to the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QmwqzdMsRkC&amp;pg=PA93|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=18 July 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52497-1|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1717 Laughton preached before King George I; his prominence has led to a tentative identification in the ''[[Dunciad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Pope|title=The Poems of Alexander Pope: The Dunciad (1728) &amp; The Dunciad Variorum (1729)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Ghys7hD2WAC&amp;pg=PA79|accessdate=30 May 2013|year=2007|publisher=Pearson/Longman|isbn=978-0-582-42342-8|page=79 note 370}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was installed prebendary of the eighth stall in [[Worcester Cathedral]]. He died on 28 July 1723.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Laughton published ''A Sermon preach'd before the King at King's College Chapel in Cambridge'' (1717). He published some verses, and left in manuscript his speech, as senior proctor, in the bachelors' schools, and ''On Natural Religion''.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Under [[Poland#Postwar communist Poland|communism]] he was one of the editors of the [[samizdat]] quarterly [[Arka (samizdat)|“Arka”]]. After the collapse of the communist regime he co-founded the [[Centre for Political Thought]], which combines research, teaching, seminars and conferences and is also a publishing house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omp.org.pl/onas.php |title=Ośrodek Myśli Politycznej (Center for Political Thought) |publisher=omp.org.pl |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has translated and written commentaries to [[Plato|Plato’s]] ''[[Phaedo]]'' (1995), ''[[Euthyphro]]'' (1998) and [[Apology (Plato)|''Apology'']] (2003). He is the author of several books: ''Plato’s Critique of Democracy'' (1990), ''Toleration'' (1997), ''A Treatise on Liberty'' (2007) and ''An Essay on the Polish Soul'' (2008), ''Socrates'' (2013).

In 2005 he was elected to a seat in the [[Senate of the Republic of Poland|Polish Senate]] (representing the [[Law and Justice|Law and Justice Party]]), where he became [[Deputy Speaker]]. In 2007 he was [[Ministry of National Education (Poland)|Poland’s Education Minister]], and in 2007-2009 Secretary of State in the [[Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland|Chancellery of President]] [[Lech Kaczyński]]. He is currently a member of the [[European Parliament]], where he sits on the [[Committee on Foreign Affairs (EU)|Foreign Affairs Committee]], and a Co-chairman of the [[European Conservatives and Reformists|Conservatives and Reformists parliamentary group]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecrgroup.eu/ryszard-legutko-elected-the-ecr-co-chairman/|title=ECR Group - European Conservatives and Reformists Group|last=Reformists|first=European Conservatives and|website=ecrgroup.eu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Sued in 2010 for violation of personal rights by calling students who demanded removal of Christian symbols from a public school “unruly brats spoiled by their parents”, he asked for a dismissal of the case based on his immunity as a member of European Parliament.  In 2011 the court denied that request.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gazetawroclawska.pl/stronaglowna/333263,wroc-aw-legutko-odpowie-przed-s-dem-za-smarkaczy,id,t.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Plaintiffs are represented by an attorney on a pro-bono basis under the Precedential Cases Program of the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ns-adwokaci.pl/pro-bono-en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17811">The '''spirit spouse''' is one of the most widespread elements of [[shamanism]], distributed through all continents and at all cultural levels. Often, these spirit husbands/wives are seen as the primary helping spirits of the shaman, who assist them in their work, and help them gain power in the world of spirit. The relationships shamans have with their spirit spouses may be expressed in romantic, sexual, or purely symbolic ways, and may include gender transformation as a part of correctly pairing with their "spouse". Shamans report engaging with their spirit spouses through dreams, trance, and other ritual elements.&lt;ref&gt;Orlando O. Espín &amp; James B. Nickoloff: ''An Introductory Dictionary of Theology and Religious Studies''. Liturgical Press, 2007. p. 1315b&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures, gaining a spirit spouse is a necessary and expected part of initiation into becoming a shaman. Evidence of spirit spouses may be seen in non-shamanic cultures as well, including dreams about Christ by nuns,&lt;ref&gt;instance (Russian Orthodox) &amp;ndash; Steven Fanning: ''Mystics of the Christian Tradition''. Routledge, 2001. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;instance (Catholic) &amp;ndash; [http://laxlim.blogspot.com/2006/01/frugal-nuns-of-barrios-altos-now-surf.htm "nuns of Barrios Altos"]&lt;/ref&gt; who are considered to be "brides of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wGti0MSyyWIC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq= instances &amp;ndash; Patrician Crawford: "Women's Dreams in early modern England", p. 100. In:- [[Daniel Pick]] &amp; Lyndal Roper (eds.): ''Dreams and History''. Psychology Press, 2004. pp. 91-104]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Particular instances==
===South America===
In South America, the shaman is a dominant figure. The type of shamanism practiced in this region has similarities with those of ethnic groups residing in Siberia and these include the process of initiation. In both of these societies, the process included marriage to a spirit spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shamanism|last=Vitebsky|first=Piers|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2001|isbn=0806133287|location=Norman|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] in [[Momostenango]], Guatemala—Diviners "are recruited in a classical shamanic fashion, including divine election – through ... dreams – and the process involves a marriage to a spirit spouse."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Tedlock: "Divination as a Way of Knowing", p. 194.

Events that highlight the role of the spirit spouse include the Andean people's Tinku Festival, held in the first week of May. This Andean religious event celebrates [[Pachamama]], a goddess considered to be the Mother Earth. The festivity includes a ceremonial ritual, wherein participants shed blood as sacrifice and offering to the goddess in order to acquire blessing and guarantee a plentiful harvest. Shamans troop to the Tinku Festival to search for their spirit spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evil Spiritual Marriage: Everybody has a Spirit Spouse|last=Akerele|first=Anthony|publisher=NMountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries Virginia|year=2013|isbn=9780983776062|location=Springfield, VA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christian literature, there are demons called incubus and succubus, who are also called types of spirit spouses. They are specifically referred to as spirit wife and spirit husband, respectively. We knew of these creatures, for instance, in the work of St. Augustine where it was stated that "many have verified it by their own experience and trustworthy persons have corroborated the experiences others told, that sylvans and fauns, commonly called incubi, have often wicked assaults upon women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Crushing Invisible Barriers: Onset of a Glorious Marital Destiny|last=Kyalo|first=Dee|publisher=Westbow Press|year=2013|isbn=9781490817682|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; These creatures are considered as spirit spouses, who only exist in dreams having intercourse with the dreamer.

Amongst the varied tribes of southern [[Nigeria]] such as the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and the [[Igbo people|Igbo]], ''Spirit Spouses of the Sea'' are common features of life due to the geographical closeness of their cultures to the Atlantic Ocean, though attitudes to their supposed existence depend largely on the religious inclinations of the individuals concerned. For example, a Yoruba [[Yoruba religion|traditionalist]] might look at a conjugal visit from a dream-based lover in much the same way as the aforementioned Ewe and Baule do, whereas a [[Muslim]] or [[Christian]] tribesman in the same situation would most likely look at it as a grave misfortune and seek the mystic aid of a spiritual counsellor to rectify what he would see as a probably dangerous connection to an otherworldly ''demon''.

=== Neopaganism ===
The controversial, self-proclaimed [[Contemporary witchcraft#Traditional Witchcraft|traditional witch]] Robin Artisson includes a variation of the Norse [[fetch (folklore)|fetch]] concept in his book ''The Witching Way of the Hollow Hill''.&lt;ref&gt;Artisson, R. (2009). [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0982031882 Witching Way of the Hollow Hill]. Pendraig Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; He supports this with the thesis that the questing/rescuing heroes in myths, legends, and fairy tales can be seen as the soul, and rescued maidens as the fetch bride. However, he does not make it clear if this occurs in dreams, [[Shamanism#Practice|shamanic journey]]s in a [[trance]] state, or both—though trance work is an important part of his theology and recommended practice. Some other Neopagan authors from very different traditions have also hinted at the possibility spiritual-sexual union of some sort with divine or spirit being.

==Contrast against opposite-gender spirit-mediumship==
The practice of dream-based spirit-marriage would appear to exclude and be excluded by (i.e., not be practiced by the same practitioners, nor perhaps even ever known in the same ethnic culture, as) the practice of opposite-gender spirit-possession mediumship. The latter practice (of opposite-gender spirit-possession mediumship) is attested in, e.g., Okinawa, Siam, and Burma, in each of which areas it would appear to be mainly (if not entirely) based on non-remembered (putatively non-conscious) trance. 

The practice of dream-based spirit-marriage would appear likewise to exclude and be excluded by shallower trances involving some partial degree of control (but permanently and continuously, instead of merely intermittently as was the case in non-remembered trance) of the practitioner by a spirit-entity of opposite gender from that of the practitioner; which is attested not only among the [[Two-Spirit|berdache]] in tribes of the Great Plains of North America, but also among the manang in Borneo, and perhaps also among numerous other persons and geographic regions (including European practitioners of homosexual magic, etc.).

===Asia===
Thai—For a male spirit-medium, "female spirits possess the medium on Saturdays";&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2000, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; for which occasions the male medium is attired in feminine garments&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2000, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;—these are events of spirit-possession by the medium's "losing consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2000, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; However, dreaming is not significant for T'ai spirit-mediumship.&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2000, p. 290; referring to Gananath Obeyesekere: ''Medusa's Hair'', p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; (There is, nevertheless, some degree of similarity between this practice of becoming possessed by an opposite-gender spirit regularly on a particular day of the week; and the custom in Haitian spirit-marriage of regularly devoting a particular day of the week to one's marital duty to that spirit.)&lt;ref&gt;"Once the ceremony is complete, the spouse will abstain from sexual relations on his or her Lwa's day of the week, reserving that time for visits from his or her divine mate."

'''Thiruvalluvar''', also known as '''Valluvar''', was a celebrated [[Tamil people|Tamil]] poet and [[philosopher]]. He is best known for authoring ''[[Tirukkural|Thirukkuṛaḷ]]'', a collection of couplets on ethics, political and economical matters, and love. The text is considered as one of the finest works of the [[Tamil literature]].

Much of the information about Valluvar comes from legendary accounts, and little is known with certainty about his family background, religious affiliation, or birthplace. He lived in present-day [[Tamil Nadu]] state of [[India]], and his [[floruit]] is dated variously from 4th century BCE to 7th century CE based on the traditional accounts and the linguistic analyses of his writings.

Valluvar has literally influenced every scholar down the ages since his time across the ethical, social, political, economical, religious, philosophical, and spiritual spheres.{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=7–13}}{{sfn|Sundaramurthi, 2000|p=624}} Because the life, culture and ethics of the [[Tamil people|Tamils]] are considered to be solely defined in terms of the values set by the Kural literature, the government and the people of [[Tamil diaspora|Tamil land]] alike venerate Valluvar and his work with utmost reverence.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}} He is known by numerous honorific designations, such as Saint, First Poet, Divine Poet, Brahma, and Great Scholar.{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=22}}

== Background ==
There is negligible authentic information about the life of Valluvar.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=155}} In fact, neither his actual name nor the original title of his work can be determined with certainty.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=125}} ''Tirukkural'' itself does not name its author. Reminiscing this, [[Monsieur Ariel]], a [[French people|French]] scholar of the 19th century, famously said of the ''Tirukkural'' thus: ''Ce livre sans nom, par un auteur sans nom'' ("The book without a name by an author without a name").&lt;ref name="GUPope_SacredKurral"&gt;{{cite book

Various claims have been made regarding Valluvar's occupation. One tradition claims that he was a [[Paraiyar]] weaver.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=124-125}} Another theory is that he must have been from the agricultural caste of [[Vellalar]]s because he extols agriculture in his work.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}} [[Raghava Iyengar|Mu Raghava Iyengar]] speculated that "valluva" in his name is a variation of "vallabha", the designation of a royal officer.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}} [[S. Vaiyapuri Pillai]] derived his name from "valluvan" (a Paraiyar caste of royal drummers) and theorized that he was "the chief of the proclaiming boys analogous to a trumpet-major of an army".{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}}

The poem ''Kapilar Akaval'' (or ''Ahaval''), purportedly written by [[Kapilar]], describes its author as a brother of Valluvar. It states that they were children of a [[Pulaya]] woman named Adi and a [[Brahmin]] named Bhagwan.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=227}} The poem claims that the couple had seven children, including three sons (Thiruvalluvar, Kapilar, and Atikaman) and four sisters (Awai, Uppai, Uruvai, and Velli).{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1991|p=25}} However, this legendary account is spurious.{{sfn|Shuddhananda A. Sarma|2007|p=76}}{{sfn|Irāmaccantiran̲ Nākacāmi|1997|p=202}} [[Kamil Zvelebil]] dates ''Kapilar Ahaval'' to 15th century CE, based on its language.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=227}} Various biographies mention the name of Valluvar's wife as [[Vasuki (wife of Valluvar)|Vasuki]], but such details are of doubtful historicity.{{sfn|Mohan Lal|1992|p=4341}}

[[George Uglow Pope]] called Valluvar "the greatest poet of South India", but according to [[Kamil Zvelebil]], he does not seem to have been a poet. According to Zvelebil, while the author handles the [[metre (poetry)|metre]] very skillfully, the ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' does not feature "true and great poetry" throughout the work, except, notably, in the [[Inbam (Kural book)|third book]] (pleasure). This suggests that Valluvar's main aim was not to produce a work of art, but rather an instructive text focused on wisdom, justice, and ethics.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=168}}

The ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' has been dated variously from 300 BCE to 7th century CE. According to traditional accounts, it was the last work of the third [[Tamil Sangams|Sangam]] and was subjected to a divine test (which it passed). The scholars who believe this tradition, such as Somasundara Bharathiar and M. Rajamanickam, date the text to as early as 300 BCE. Historian [[K. K. Pillay]] assigned it to the early 1st century CE.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=124}}

Linguist [[Kamil Zvelebil]] is certain that ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' does not belong to the [[Sangam literature|Sangam]] period and dates it to somewhere between 450 and 500 CE.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=124}} His estimate is based on the language of the text, its allusions to the earlier works, and its borrowing from some Sanskrit treatises.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}} Zvelebil notes that the text features several grammatical innovations, that are absent in the older [[Sangam literature]]. The text also features a higher number of [[Sanskrit]] [[loan word]]s compared with these older texts.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=169}} According to Zvelebil, besides being part of the ancient Tamil literary tradition, the author was also a part of the "one great Indian ethical, didactic tradition", as a few of his verses seem to be translations of the verses in Sanskrit texts such as ''[[Dharmaśāstra|Mānavadharmaśāstra]]'' and [[Kautilya]]'s ''[[Arthaśāstra]].{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=171}}

[[S. Vaiyapuri Pillai]] assigned the work to c. 650 CE, believing that it borrowed from some Sanskrit works of the 6th century CE.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=124}} Zvelebil disagrees with this assessment, pointing out that some of the words that Pillai believed to be Sanskrit loan words have now been proved to be of [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] origin by [[Thomas Burrow]] and [[Murray Barnson Emeneau]].{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=171}}

With the exact date of Valluvar still under debate, taking the latest of the estimated dates, the [[Government of Tamil Nadu|Tamil Nadu government]] is using 31 BCE as the year of Valluvar, as suggested by [[Maraimalai Adigal]], from 18 January 1935.&lt;ref&gt;''Thiruvalluvar Ninaivu Malar'', 1935, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Valluvar year is calculated by adding 31 to any year of the common era.

== Birthplace ==
The poem ''Kapilar Akaval'' states that Valluvar was born on the top of an oil-nut tree in Mayilapuram ([[Mylapore]] in [[Chennai]]).{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1991|p=25}} On the other hand, the poem number 21 of ''Tiruvalluva Maalai'' claims that he was born in [[Madurai]].{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=125}}

In 2005, a 3-member research team from the [[Kanyakumari (town)|Kanyakumari]] Historical and Cultural Research Centre (KHCRC) claimed that Valluvar was born in Thirunayanarkurichi, a village in present-day [[Kanyakumari district]]. Their claim was based on an old [[Kani tribe|Kani]] tribal leader who told them that Valluvar was a king who ruled the "Valluvanadu" territory in the hilly tracts of the Kanyakumari district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://zeenews.india.com/home/research-team-claims-to-have-found-thiruvalluvars-kingdom_213930.html |title=Research team claims to have found Thiruvalluvar's kingdom |publisher=Zee News |date=26 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion ==
[[File:Thiruvalluvar Temple.JPG|thumb|180px|A temple for Thiruvalluvar in [[Mylapore]]]]
Valluvar is generally thought to have belonged to either [[Jainism]] or [[Hinduism]].{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|pp=156-171}}{{sfn|Mohan Lal|1992|pp=4333–4334}} Valluvar's treatment of the concept of [[ahimsa]] or [[non-violence]], which is the principal concept of both these religions, bolsters this. In particular, his treatment of the chapters on [[vegetarianism|strict vegetarianism]] (or [[veganism]]) (Chapters 26 and 32) and [[non-killing]] (Chapter 33) reflects the Jain precepts, where these are stringently enforced.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|pp=156-171}} The three parts that the Kural literature is divided into, namely, ''aram'' (virtue), ''porul'' (wealth) and ''inbam'' (love), aiming at attaining ''veedu'' (ultimate salvation), follow, respectively, the four foundations of Hinduism, namely, [[dharma]], [[artha]], [[kama]] and [[moksha]].{{sfn|P. S. Sundaram|1990|pp=7–16}} His mentioning of God [[Vishnu]] in couplets 610 and 1103 and [[Goddess Lakshmi]] in couplets 167, 408, 519, 565, 568, 616, and 617 hints at the [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] beliefs of Valluvar. Other eastern beliefs of the poet found in the book include previous birth and rebirth, seven births, and some ancient Indian astrological concepts, among others.{{sfn|P. R. Natarajan|2008|pp=1–6}}

However, owing to the Kural text's non-denominational nature, almost every religious group in [[India]], including [[Christianity]], has claimed the work and its author as one of their own.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}}

=== Jainism ===
[[Kamil Zvelebil]] believes that the ethics of the ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' reflect the [[Jainism|Jain]] moral code (e.g. ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' 251-260 talks about vegetarianism, and ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' 321-333 talks against killing). Zvelebil states that the text features "several purely Jaina technical terms", such as the following epithets of God:{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=157}}

* ''Malarmicaiyekinan'' (''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' 3), "he who walked upon the [lotus] flower"
* ''Aravaliyantanan'' (''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' 3), "the Brahmin [who had] the wheel of dharma"
* ''Enkunattan'' (''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' 9), "one of the eight-fold qualities"
* ''Atipakavan'' (''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' 1), "the Primeval Lord"

Zvelebil notes that even the 13th century Hindu scholar [[Parimēlaḻakar]], who wrote a commentary on ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'', accepted that such epithets are applicable only to the Jain [[Arihant (Jainism)|Arhat]]. Some other epithets mentioned in the text also reflect a "strong ascetic flavour" characteristic of Jainism:{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=157}}

* ''Ventutal ventamai ilan'' (''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' 4), "he who has neither desire nor aversion"
* ''Porivayil aintavittan'' (''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' 6), "he who has destroyed the gates of the five senses"

Zvelebil further states that Valluvar seems to have been "cognizant of the latest developments" in Jainism.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=157}} Zvelebil theorizes that he was probably "a learned Jain with eclectic leanings", who was well-acquainted with the earlier Tamil literature, and also had some knowledge of the Sanskrit texts.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=155}}

=== Hinduism ===
[[File:Valluva-nayanar.jpg|thumb|180px|An ancient image of Valluvar]]
Multiple [[Hinduism|Hindu]] sects have claimed Valluvar as one of their own and have tried to align his verses with their own teachings.{{sfn|Swamiji Iraianban|1997|p=13}} [[Shaivite]]s have characterised Valluvar as a devotee of Shiva and have installed his images in their temples.{{sfn|Raj Pruthi|Bela Rani Sharma|1995|p=113}}

=== Buddhism ===
Anti-caste activist [[Iyothee Thass]], who converted to [[Buddhism]], claimed that Valluvar was originally called "Tiruvalla Nayanar", and was a Buddhist.{{sfn|K. A. Geetha|2015|p=49}} Thass described him as follows: Tiruvalla Nayanar was born in Madurai, as the son of King Kanchan and Queen Upakesi. When he grew up, the prince wandered across many countries, until he joined a Buddhist [[sangha|sangam]] at Thinnanur. There, he learned about the Buddhist doctrine from his guru Chakaya Munivar.{{sfn|K. A. Geetha|2015|p=50}} Thass further contended that the name "Tirukkuṛaḷ" is a reference to the Buddhist ''[[Tripiṭaka]]''.{{sfn|K. A. Geetha|2015|p=50}} He claims that Valluvar's book was originally called ''Tirikural'' ("Three Kurals"), because it adhered to the three Buddhist scriptures ''[[Abhidhamma Pitaka|Dhamma Pitaka]]'', ''[[Sutta Pitaka]]'', and ''[[Vinaya Pitaka]]''.{{sfn|K. A. Geetha|2015|p=49}} According to Thass, the legend that presents Valluvar as the son of a [[Brahmin]] father and a Paraiyar mother was invented by Brahmins, who wanted to Hinduise a Buddhist text.{{sfn|K. A. Geetha|2015|p=49}}

=== Christianity ===
Christian missionary [[George Uglow Pope]] claimed that the ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' shows [[Christianity|Christian]] influence, particularly from the [[Catechetical School of Alexandria|Alexandrian school]]. He theorized that Valluvar came into contact with Christian teachers such as [[Pantaenus]] in Mayilapur and incorporated the ideas from the Christian scriptures in his text. Pope praises the Kural as an "echo of the 'Sermon on the Mount.'" In the Introduction to his English translation of the Kural, Pope even claims, "I cannot feel any hesitation in saying that the Christian Scriptures were among the sources from which the poet derived his inspiration." Zvelebil states that Pope was "rather overenthusiastic in discovering strong traces of Christianity" in ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' and dismisses Pope's hypothesis as based on "vague impressions".{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|pp=156-157}} Since the 1960s, some South Indian Christians led by M. Deivanayagam at the [[Madras Christian College]], have even characterized Valluvar as a disciple of [[Thomas the Apostle]].{{sfn|Jan A. B. Jongeneel|2009|p=111}} According to this theory, Thomas visited present-day Chennai, where Valluvar listened to his lectures on the [[Sermon of the Mount]].{{sfn|Mohan Lal|1992|p=4341}} Several Tamil scholars, both Christian and Hindu, have criticized this claim as inaccurate.{{sfn|Jan A. B. Jongeneel|2009|p=111}} Nevertheless, the chapters on the ethics of [[vegetarianism]] (Chapter 26) and [[non-killing]] (Chapter 33), which the Kural emphasizes emphatically and unambiguously unlike the [[Bible]] or other [[Abrahamic]] religious texts, suggest that the ethics of the Kural is rather a reflection of the [[Jain philosophy|Jaina moral code]] than of [[Christian ethics]].{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|pp=156-171}}

[[File:Tiruvalluvar statue LIC.jpg|thumb|200px|Statue of Valluvar at Kanyakumari]]
''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' is the chief work attributed to Valluvar. It is one of the most revered ancient works in the Tamil language. It contains 1330 couplets, which are divided into 133 sections of 10 couplets each. The first 38 sections are about ethics (''[[Aram (Kural book)|aram]]''), the next 70 about political and economic matters (''[[Porul (Kural book)|porul]]''), and the rest are about love (''[[Inbam (Kural book)|inbam]]'').{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=155}} The text has been translated into several languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tamilelibrary.org/teli/thkrl.html | title=Translation of the Tamil literary work thirukkuRaL in world languages | publisher=K. Kalyanasundaram | accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a translation into Latin by [[Constanzo Beschi]] in 1699, which helped make the work known to European intellectuals.

Valluvar is also believed to be the author of two Tamil texts on medicine, ''Gnana Vettiyan'' (1500 verses) and ''Pancharathnam'' (500 verses), although many scholars claim that they were by a later author with the same name,&lt;ref name="Cuppiramaṇiyan̲1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ca.

A temple-like memorial to Valluvar, [[Valluvar Kottam]], was built in [[Chennai]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="Abram(Firm)2003"/&gt;  This monument complex consists of structures usually found in [[Dravidian architecture|Dravidian temples]],&lt;ref name="Tourist Guide to Tamil Nadu"&gt;{{cite book|title=Tourist Guide to Tamil Nadu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGxbJqdEQrwC&amp;pg=PA20|accessdate=12 December 2010|publisher=Sura Books|isbn=978-81-7478-177-2|pages=20–}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a [[temple car]]&lt;ref name="Hancock2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Elizabeth Hancock|title=The politics of heritage from Madras to Chennai|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0duq2Vd_ahcC&amp;pg=PA113|accessdate=12 December 2010|date=8 October 2008|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-35223-1|pages=113–}}&lt;/ref&gt; carved from three blocks of [[granite]], and a shallow, rectangular pond.&lt;ref name="Abram(Firm)2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Abram|author2=Rough Guides (Firm)|title=South India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sEhJBfbhTAAC&amp;pg=PA421|accessdate=12 December 2010|year=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-84353-103-6|pages=421–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The auditorium adjoining the memorial is one of the largest in Asia and can seat up to 4,000 people.&lt;ref name="Kamath2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rina Kamath|title=Chennai|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bw2vDg2fTrMC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=12 December 2010|year=2000|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=978-81-250-1378-5|pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a 133-foot tall statue of Valluvar erected at [[Kanyakumari (town)|Kanyakumari]] at the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent, where the [[Arabian Sea]], the [[Bay of Bengal]], and the Indian Ocean converge. The 133 feet denote Tirukkuṛaḷ's 133 chapters or ''athikarams'' and the show of three fingers denote the three themes ''[[Aram (Kural book)|Aram]]'', ''[[Porul (Kural book)|Porul]]'', and ''[[Inbam (Kural book)|Inbam]]'', that is, the sections on morals, wealth and love.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5141">Reverend '''Thomas Kingsmill Abbott''' (26 March 1829 – 18 December 1913) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] scholar and educator.

Abbott was born in [[Dublin]] and was educated at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]]. He took his degree in 1851 and was made a fellow of the college in 1854. He obtained an M.A. and a D.Litt. from Trinity, and was ordained a minister in the [[Church of Ireland]].

In 1852 he solved a geometrical problem posed by [[J. J. Sylvester]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kOYv0RX3Ym4C&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;dq=Sylvester%E2%80%99+%22t+k++abbott%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qECQuMPyQ8&amp;sig=GEtpvuRf2oBkwUXzsRPX8vNt8_0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKyJX9o8fPAhVGSSYKHda1CxIQ6AEIIzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Sylvester%E2%80%99%20%22t%20k%20%20abbott%22&amp;f=false On a geometrical Problem noticed by Mr. Sylvester.] ''The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science'', Vol. V.–Fourth Series, January–June, 1853, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

He occupied the [[chair (academic)|chair]] of moral philosophy (1867–72), of biblical Greek (1875–88), and of Hebrew (1879–1900). In 1887 he was elected librarian in Trinity and, in 1900, completed catalogues of the library's manuscript holdings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcd.ie/Library/manuscripts/catalogues.php Catalogues – Manuscripts &amp; Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of a group of Irish scholars, including [[J. P. Mahaffy]], who made significant contributions to the dissemination and study of the works of [[Immanuel Kant]]. His translation of Kant's "Critique of Practical Reason" remained the standard English version of the text well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7Rnz9cDWt9kC&amp;pg=PA270&amp;dq=%22thomas+kingsmill+abbott%22+1829+1913&amp;ei=8xYXS6f6Haq-ygT16dW1Bw#v=onepage&amp;q=abbott&amp;f=false A History of Irish Thought]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1901, he received an honorary [[Doctor of Divinity|doctorate in Divinity]] from the [[University of Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Glasgow University jubilee |day_of_week=Friday |date=14 June 1901 |page_number=10 |issue=36481| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859 he married Caroline Kingsmill, eldest daughter of the [[penology|penologist]] Rev. Joseph Kingsmill.

He died in [[Killiney]] in Dublin on 18 December 1913.

'''Tithing settlement''' is the name of a formalized series of meetings held at [[Ward (LDS Church)|local congregations]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). During tithing settlement, each member of the church is individually interviewed by the [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] or [[branch president]] of the congregation and asked to declare whether he or she has paid a full [[tithe]] to the church, which is defined as ten per cent of the member's income. Tithing settlement meetings are generally held in November or December.

During the meeting, each member is given a copy of his or her donation record for the year, and asked to confirm it is correct.

Each church member is required to choose one of the following tithing statuses as defined by the church:&lt;ref name="instructions"&gt;[https://www.lds.org/help/support/tithing-status?lang=eng], lds.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Full-tithe''' payers have paid one-tenth of their income as tithing. ([[Missionary (LDS Church)|Full-time missionaries]] and those completely dependent on church welfare assistance are also full tithe-payers.)
* '''Part-tithe''' payers have paid tithing, but the amount is less than one-tenth of their income.
* '''Non-tithe''' payers have not paid tithing during the year and (in the view of the church) are not exempt from paying tithing.
* Previously, '''Exempt''' members had no income and paid no tithing, but they declare that they would have paid a full tithe if they had income. But it appears that this classification has been recently removed.

Church members are invited to make a payment to correct any deficiency before the records are closed for year-end.

If a church member declines to participate or attend a tithing settlement meeting, the bishop or branch president is required to choose a tithing status on their behalf.&lt;ref name="instructions" /&gt;

Payment of tithing is a core doctrine of the church for all members, including children. Church members must declare themselves to be "full-tithe payers" in order to receive a [[temple recommend]] and attend one of the church's [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]]. However, that is done in a separate meeting from the tithing settlement.&lt;ref name="Tithing Settlement"&gt;[https://tech.lds.org/wiki/index.php?title=Tithing_settlement Church Tithing Settlement Overview], lds.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The LDS Church uses the honor system and personal accountability of the individual tithe payer. It is not the church's general position to question the honesty of tithe payers. The church predominantly accepts the status declared by the tithe payer through counsel and consideration of the leaders. It is up to the individual tithe payer to determine and in turn declare to their leaders whether he or she feels they are a full tithe payer or not.

==Factors of a good work ethic==
Proponents of a strong work ethic consider it to be vital for achieving goals, that it gives strength to their orientation and the right mindset. A work ethic is a set of moral principles a person uses in their job. People who possess a strong work ethic embody certain principles that guide their work behavior, leading them to produce high-quality work consistently and the output [[Motivation|motivates]] them to stay on track. A good work ethic fuels an individual's needs and goals, it is related to the initiative by a person for the objectives. It is considered as a source of self respect, satisfaction, and fulfillment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Factors are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2011/12/21/reviving-work-ethic-in-america/#450a49d6449a|title=Reviving Work Ethic in America|first=Dan|last=Schawbel|date=December 21, 2011|website=forbes.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyswan/2016/10/05/7-work-ethic-commandments-for-an-entrepreneur/|title=7 Work Ethic Commandments For An Entrepreneur|first=Andy|last=Swan|date=October 5, 2016|website=forbes.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Goal-oriented actions: it is not about making plans or the next logical steps; it's about getting things done so that the work invested wouldn't be counter-productive.
#Prioritized focus: focusing on qualitative activities that a person is capable and in areas where they can make a difference or a high impact based on objectives.
#Being available and reliable: spending time on the work and building oneself up for the task.
#Conscientiousness: a desire to do a task well, being vigilant and organized.
#Creating a rewarding routine/system: Engaging in tasks that provide strength and energy which can be transferred to your ultimate goals, creating a habit and a habitat for success.
#Embracing positivism: shape a problem with the statement "good, (action) (problem)", e.g. "I'm tired and it is time for a workout" leads to "Good. Workout tired".

A negative work ethic is a behavior of a single individual or a group that has led to a systematic lack of productivity, reliability, accountability and a growing sphere of unprofessional/unhealthy relationships (e.g., power politics, lack of social skills, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/negative-work-ethic-definition-10235.html|title=Negative Work Ethic Definition|author=Robert Vaux|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assumptions===
Assumptions about good work ethic is drawn out in philosophical writings of Goldman, they are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alvin I. Goldman|title=A theory of human action|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RfADAQAAIAAJ|year=1970|publisher=Prentice-Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#The path to what you want is to take action.
#The success of action plans depend upon how congruent one's worldview ([[wikt:Weltanschauung|Weltanschauung]]) is with the society's.
#Many problems faced are only a temporary breakdown of self management.
#Setting time limits for achieving goals helps to overcome the edge of discomforts that time can have on subjective needs.
#A positive problem-solving or goal attainment experience improves one's ability to cope with the next difficulty.
#Hardships in life is a normality, they become a problem when they are the same over and over.
#A person is what s/he does, and feelings flow from behavior.
#Feelings can be viewed as beliefs about one's wants.

In the 1970s a good work ethic was considered as a lifestyle to meet unmet or unsatisfied wants by people.

==Capitalist view==
{{See also|Protestant work ethic}}

Steven Malanga refers to "what was once understood as the work ethic—not just hard work but also a set of accompanying [[virtue]]s, whose crucial role in the development and sustaining of [[free markets]] too few now recall".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_3_work-ethic.html |title = Whatever Happened to the Work Ethic? by Steven Malanga, City Journal Summer 2009 |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]] quotes the ethical writings of [[Benjamin Franklin]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Remember, that ''time is money''.  He that can earn ten shillings a day by his labor, and goes abroad, or sits idle, one half of that day, though he spends but sixpence during his diversion or idleness, ought not to reckon ''that'' the only expense; he has really spent, or rather thrown away, five shillings besides.

Remember, that money is the ''prolific, generating nature''.  Money can beget money, and its offspring can beget more, and so on.  Five shillings turned is six, turned again is seven and threepence, and so on, till it becomes a hundred pounds.  The more there is of it, the more it produces every turning, so that the profits rise quicker and quicker.  He that kills a breeding sow, destroys all her offspring to the thousandth generation.  He that murders a crown, destroys all that it might have produced, even scores of pounds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Franklin]], ''Advice to a Young Tradesman, Written by an Old One'' (1748), Italics in the original&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Weber notes that this is not a philosophy of mere greed, but a statement laden with moral language.  It is in effect an ethical response to the natural desire for [[Hedonic motivation|hedonic]] reward, a statement of the value of delayed gratification to achieve self-actualization. Franklin claims that Bible readings revealed to him the usefulness of virtue. Indeed, this reflects the then christian search for ethic for living and the struggle to make a living.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max ''The Protestant Ethic and "The Spirit of Capitalism" (Penguin Books, 2002) translated by Peter Baehr and Gordon C. Wells, pp.9-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental studies have shown that people with fair work ethic are able to tolerate tedious jobs with equitable monetary rewards and benefits, they are highly critical, have a tendency for [[workaholism]] and a negative relation with leisure activity concepts. They valued meritocracy and egalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;Mirels and Garrett (1971). Protestant Work Ethic. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 36, 40–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s work ethic was considered very important, nonconformist ideals were dealt autocratically. Suppression of humor in the workplace was one of them. It is recorded that at the Ford Company a worker John Gallo was fired for being "caught in the act of smiling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Robert|title=The Psychology of Humor at Work: A Psychological Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c3y_DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT149|date=19 December 2016|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|isbn=978-1-317-37077-2|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-capitalist view==
[[Countercultural]] groups and communities have challenged these values in recent decades.

The French Leftist [[philosopher]] [[André Gorz]] (1923–2007) wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The work ethic has become obsolete. It is no longer true that producing more means working more, or that producing more will lead to a better way of life.
The connection between more and better has been broken; our needs for many products and services are already more than adequately met, and many of our as-yet-unsatisfied needs will be met not by producing more, but by producing differently, producing other things, or even producing less. This is especially true as regards our needs for air, water, space, silence, beauty, time and human contact.

Neither is it true any longer that the more each individual works, the better off everyone will be. In a [[post-industrial society]], not everyone ''has'' to work hard in order to survive, though may be forced to anyway due to the economic system. The present crisis has stimulated technological change of an unprecedented scale and speed: '[[Microchip revolution|the micro-chip revolution]]'. The object and indeed the effect of this revolution has been to make rapidly increasing savings in labour, in the industrial, administrative and service sectors. Increasing production is secured in these sectors by decreasing amounts of labour. As a result, the social process of production no longer needs everyone to work in it on a full-time basis. The work ethic ceases to be viable in such a situation and workbased society is thrown into crisis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antenna.nl/~waterman/gorz.html|title=GSD: Andre Gorz}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anti-capitalists believe that the concept of "hard work" is meant by capitalists to delude the [[working class]] into becoming loyal servants to the [[elite]], and that working hard, in itself, is not automatically an honorable thing, but only a means to creating more wealth for the people at the top of the [[Organization|economic pyramid]]. In the [[Soviet Union]], the regime portrayed work ethic as an ideal to strive for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urban75.org/mayday/capitalism.html|title=Intro to Capitalism - Does capitalism work for the benefit of all, or is it just a tool to exploit the working classes? Or is Anarchy the way forward?|website=Our Mayday|date=April 2003|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recession is a contributing factor that holds back work ethic, because the generation that inherits economic decline lives in an economy that isn’t ready to receive them. Without work there to do, the ethic that is attached to it fails to generate distinctive value. The negative work ethic and power structures that doesn't value or credit work done or unethically attribute work done as a service or  with higher moral ideals have dissolved the ethic presented in the society and turned the focus onto self-centered perks and individualism. Further, urbanization and an emphasis on large-scale businesses has led to eliminating avenues for learning vital concepts about work. Millennials in a research identified what made them unique was consumerist trends like technology use, music/pop culture, liberal/tolerant beliefs, clothes, and individualistic ones like greater intelligence than work, they were not able to distinguish the concept in the traditional understandings of work ethic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2010/04/the-millenials-work-ethic-prob|title=Debunking The Millennials’ Work Ethic “Problem”|author=Erica Williams|date=April 8, 2010|website=hbr.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Indo-European topics|Religion and mythology}}
'''Yazdânism''', or the '''Cult of Angels''', is a pre-[[Islam]]ic, [[native religion]] of the [[Kurds#religion|Kurds]]. The term was introduced by Kurdish scholar [[Mehrdad Izady]] to represent what he considers the "original" religion of the Kurds&lt;ref name="Foltz 219"&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Foltz |chapter=Two Kurdish Sects: The Yezidis and the Yaresan |title=Religions of Iran: From Prehistory to the Present |isbn=978-1-78074-307-3 |chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/9387407 |page=219 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to Izady, Yazdânism is now continued in the denominations of [[Yazidis]]m, [[Yarsanism]], and [[Ishikism|Ishik Alevism]].&lt;ref&gt;Izady, 1992. pp. 170 passim&lt;/ref&gt; The three traditions subsumed under the term Yazdânism are primarily practiced in relatively isolated communities; from [[Khorasan Province|Khurasan]] to [[Anatolia]], and parts of western Iran.

The concept of Yazdânism has found a wide perception both within and beyond [[Kurdish nationalism|Kurdish nationalist]] discourses, but has been disputed by other recognized scholars of [[Iranian religions]]. Well established, however, are the "striking" and "unmistakable" similarities between the [[Yazidis]] and the [[Yarsanism|Yaresan]] or ''Ahl-e Haqq'',{{sfn|Kreyenbroek|1995|pages=54; 59}} some of which can be traced back to elements of an ancient faith that was probably dominant among [[Western Iranian languages|Western Iranians]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foltz|first1=Richard|title=Two Kurdish Sects: The Yezidis and the Yaresan|pages=219|url=https://www.academia.edu/9387407/Religions_of_Iran_From_Prehistory_to_the_Present}}&lt;/ref&gt; and likened to practices of pre-[[Zoroastrian]] [[Mithra]]ic religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Foltz |chapter=Mithra and Mithraism |title=Religions of Iran: From Prehistory to the Present |isbn=978-1-78074-307-3 |chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/9387407 |page=30 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehrdad Izady defines the Yazdanism as an ancient [[Hurrians|Hurrian]] religion and states that [[Mitanni]] could have introduced some of the [[Vedic]] tradition that appears to be manifest in Yazdanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploring Kurdish Origins|url=http://www.kurdistanica.com/?q=node/74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[Mehrdad Izady]] derived the term from a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] concept of [[Yazata|Holy beings]] ({{lang-pal|Yazdān}}), often translated as "angels" or "[[archangel]]s". While he refers to "Yazdânism" as possibly being the real name of this old religion and the sources of modern designation, [[Yezidi]], he has published evidence of this assertion only in his 1992 book, ''Kurds: A Concise Handbook.''

One of the few ancient sources that mention the "Sipâsîâns", considered synonymous with the Yazdanis is the ''[[Dabestân-e Madâheb]]'', written between 1645 and 1658.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dabestan-e Madaheb, section 1-2|author=Azar Kayvan|newspaper=|date=1645–1658|url=http://www.avesta.org/dabestan/dabestn2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principal beliefs ==
{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=November 2015}}
In Yazdani theologies, an absolute [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] [[God]] (''Hâk'' or ''Haq'') encompasses the whole universe. He binds together the [[cosmos]] with his essence, and manifests as the ''heft sirr'' (the "Heptad", "Seven Mysteries", "Seven Angels"), who sustain universal life and can incarnate in persons, ''bâbâ'' ("Gates" or "[[Avatar]]").&lt;ref name="Kurdistanica"&gt;Kurdistanica – Encyclopaedia of Kurdistan: ''[http://www.kurdistanica.com/?q=node/101 Cult of Angels]&lt;/ref&gt; These seven emanations are comparable to the seven ''[[Anunnaki]]'' aspects of ''[[Anu]]''  of ancient Mesopotamian theology, and they include ''[[Melek Taus]]'' (the "Peacock Angel" or "King"), who is the same as the ancient god [[Tammuz (deity)|Dumuzi]] son of [[Enki]]{{sfn|Açıkyıldız|2010|page=74}} and the main deity in Yazidi theology, and ''Shaykh Shams al-Din'', "the sun of the faith", who is [[Mithra]].&lt;ref&gt;Bidlisi, Izady. 2000. p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

These religions continue the [[theology]] of [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian religions]] under a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] influence,&lt;ref&gt;Meho, 1997. p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; and expressed through an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persianate]] [[Sufism|Sufi]] lexicon.

===Reincarnation===
Yazdânism teaches the cyclic nature of the world with [[reincarnation]] of the [[deity]] and of people being a common feature, traversing [[incarnation]]s of the soul of a man into human form or an animal or even a plant. These religions also teach that there are seven cycles of the universe, six of which have already happened, while the seventh one is yet to unfold. In each cycle, there is a set of six reincarnated persons (one female, five male) who will herald the new cycle and preside over it (the seventh one in the set being the ever-lasting, the ever-present Almighty).

The reincarnation of the deity could be in one of the three forms: a "reflection incarnation", a "guest incarnation", or the highest form, an "embodiment incarnation". [[Jesus]], [[Ali]], and the three leaders of the three primary branches of Yazdânism are all embodiment incarnations, meaning [[Deity|Godhead]] actually born in a human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== Seven divine beings ===
The principal feature of Yazdânism is the belief in seven benevolent divine beings that defend the world from an equal number of malign entities. While this concept exists in its purest form in [[Yârsânism]] and [[Yazidism]], it evolves into "seven saints/spiritual persons", which are called "Yedi Ulu Ozan" in [[Alevism]].{{sfn|Izady|1992|pp=170 passim}} Another important feature of these religions is a doctrine of reincarnation. The belief in reincarnation has been documented among the [[Nusayri]] ''(Shamsi [[Alawites]])'' as well.{{sfn|Izady|1992|pp=170 passim}}

The Yazidis believe in a single [[God]] as creator of the world, which he has placed under the care of these seven “holy beings” or [[angel]]s, whose “chief” ([[archangel]]) is [[Melek Taus]], the “Peacock Angel”. The Peacock Angel, as world-ruler, causes both good and bad to befall individuals, and this ambivalent character is reflected in myths of his own temporary fall from God’s favor, before his remorseful tears extinguished the fires of his hellish prison and he was reconciled with God.

Melek Taus is sometimes identified by Muslims and Christians with [[Shaitan]] ([[Satan]]). Yazidis, however, strongly dispute this, considering him to be the leader of the [[archangels]], not a fallen angel.&lt;ref name="Bruinessen"&gt;''Kurdish Society'' by Martin Van Bruinessen, in [https://books.google.com/books?id=JZ6JAgAAQBAJ The Kurds: A Contemporary Overview], ed.

:The Yazidis of Kurdistan have been called many things, most notoriously “devil-worshippers”, a term used both by unsympathetic neighbours and fascinated Westerners. This sensational epithet is not only deeply offensive to the Yazidis themselves, but quite simply wrong.&lt;ref name="leidenuniv1998"&gt;Allison, C. (1998).

Because of this connection to the Sufi Iblis tradition, some followers of Christianity and Islam equate the Peacock Angel with their own unredeemed evil spirit [[Satan]],&lt;ref&gt;“The Peacock Angel (Malak Tawus) whom they worship may be identified with Satan, but is to them not the Lord of Evil as he is to Muslims and Christians.” In: {{cite book |author=[[Martin van Bruinessen]] |chapter=Kurdish Society |title=The Kurds: A Contemporary Overview |url={{Google books|JZ6JAgAAQBAJ|plainurl=yes}} |editor-last=Kreyenbroek |editor-first=Philip G. |editor-last2=Sperl |editor-first2=Stefan |date=2005 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Muslim and Christian neighbors of the Yezidis in the Middle East consider the Peacock Angel as the embodiment of Satan and an evil, rebellious spirit”.

=== Difference in practices from Islam ===
Yazdânis do not maintain any of the requisite [[five Pillars of Islam|five pillars]] of Islam; nor do they have [[mosques]] or frequent them. The [[Quran]] to them is as respectable as is the [[Bible]], and yet each denomination of this religion has its own [[scriptures]] that the adherents hold in a higher esteem than any one of the former or others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Two denominations==
=== Yarsanism ===
{{Main|Sultan Sahak|Yarsanism}}
From the Yarsani (sometimes also called Ahl-e Haqq or Yâresân) point of view, the universe is composed of two distinct yet interrelated worlds: the internal (''[[Batin (Islam)|batini]]'') and the external (''[[Zahir (Islam)|zahiri]]''), each having its own order and rules. Although humans are only aware of the outer world, their lives are governed according to the rules of the inner world. Among other important pillars of their belief system are that the Divine Essence has successive manifestations in human form (''mazhariyyat'', derived from ''zahir'') and the belief in [[transmigration of the soul]] (or ''dunaduni'' in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]). The Yarsani do not observe Muslim rites and rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Z. Mir-Hosseini, ''Inner Truth and Outer History: The Two Worlds of the Ahl-e Haqq of Kurdistan'', International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol.26, 1994, p.267-268&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "''Haqq''" (as in [[Yarsanism|Ahl-e Haqq]]) is often misrepresented and misinterpreted as the [[Arabic]] term for ''"Truth"''. Instead, its true meaning is clearly explained by [[Nur Ali Elahi]] (died 1974) &amp;ndash; as being "distinct from the Arabic term and in fact, should be  written as "Hâq" ("Hâq-i wâqi'") instead of "Haqq" and should be understood to be different in meaning, connotation, and essence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== Yazidism ===
{{main|Yazidis|Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir}}
[[File:Pilgrims and festival at Lalish on the day of the Ezidi New Year in 2017 18.jpg|thumb|[[Yazidi]] men]]
[[Yazidis]], who have much in common with the followers of [[Yarsanism]], state that the world created by God was at first a ''pearl''. It remained in this very small and enclosed state for some time (often a [[40 (number)#In religion|magic number]] such as forty or forty thousand years) before being remade in its current state. During this period the ''Heptad'' were called into existence, God made a covenant with them and entrusted the world to them. Besides [[Melek Taus|Tawûsê Melek]], members of the Heptad (the Seven), who were called into existence by God at the beginning of all things, include [[Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir|Sheikh ‘Adī ibn Musāfir al-Umawī ''(Şêx Adî)'']], his companion Şêx Hasan and a group known as the ''Four Mysteries'': Shamsadin, Fakhradin, Sajadin and Naserdin.

The distribution of these three beliefs follows geographic boundaries:
* The [[Alevis]] may be found in central and eastern [[Turkey]] and northwestern [[Syria]] and are [[Zaza Kurds]].
* The [[Yârsânism|Yârsâni]] or [[Yârsânism|Ahl-e Haqq]] are located in the eastern (and northeastern) part of [[Iraq]] and in western [[Iran]].
* The [[Yazidi]]s come from the Turkish-Iraqi border region, and many of them reside in [[Armenia]].

==Reception==
Izady proposes the term as denoting a belief system which "predates Islam by millennia" which is in its character "[[Aryan]]" rather than "[[Semitic people|Semitic]]".&lt;ref&gt;"a belief system of great antiquity that is fundamentally a non-Semitic religion, with an Aryan superstructure overlaying a religious foundation indigenous to the Zagros. To identify the Cult or any of its denominations as Islamic is simply a mistake born of a lack of knowledge of the religion, which pre-dates Islam by millennia." in: {{harvnb|Izady|1992|pp=172 passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of suggesting that the Muslim Kurds are Yazdanis, [[Mehrdad Izady|Izady]] suggests that Yazdani Kurds are not Muslim, and identify themselves as such only to [[Taqiyya|avoid harm]] and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Izady|1992|pp=172 passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The view on non-Islamic identity of the ''Yazdanis'' is shared by [[Mohammad Mokri]], the well-known Kurdish folklorist and historian, who states this religion to be "less [[Islamic]] than [[Baha'ism]]", which had emerged from [[Bábism]] as "a new non-[[Islam]]ic religion".&lt;ref&gt;"A belief system of great antiquity that is fundamentally a non-Semitic religion, with an [[Aryan]] superstructure overlaying a religious foundation indigenous to the [[Zagros Mountains|Zagros]]. To identify the Cult or any of its denominations as Islamic is simply a mistake born of a lack of knowledge of the religion, which pre-dates Islam by millennia." {{Citation

===Criticism===
The concept of ‘Yazdanism’ as a distinct religion has been disputed by a number of scholars. [[Richard Foltz]] considers Yazdânism, or the “Cult of Angels”, as Izady’s “invented religion”, which according to [[Richard Foltz|Foltz]] “owes more to contemporary Kurdish national sentiment than to actual religious history.”&lt;ref name="Foltz 219"/&gt;

Iranian anthropologist [[Ziba Mir-Hosseini]] states:{{sfn|Mir-Hosseini|1992|p=132}}
{{blockquote|quote=The most notable case is that of Izady (1992) who, in his eagerness to distance the Ahl-e Haqq from Islam and to give it a purely Kurdish pedigree, asserts that the sect is a denomination of a religion of great antiquity which he calls “''the Cult of Angels''”. This 'Cult', he states, is "fundamentally a non-Semitic religion, with an Aryan superstructure overlaying a religious foundation indigenous to the Zagros. To identify the Cult or any of its denominations as Islamic is simply a mistake born of a lack of knowledge of the religion, which pre-dates Islam by millennia."}}

'''''Zen in the Art of Archery''''' (Zen in der Kunst des Bogenschießens) is a book by German philosophy professor [[Eugen Herrigel]], published in 1948, about his experiences studying [[Kyūdō]], a form of Japanese [[archery]], when he lived in Japan in the 1920s. It is credited with introducing [[Zen]] to Western audiences in the late 1940s and 1950s.

==Origin==
Herrigel (1884–1955) was a German professor of philosophy, with a special interest in [[mysticism]]. From 1924 to 1929 he taught philosophy in Japan, and studied [[Kyūdō]] (the art of the [[yumi|Japanese bow]]) under a master named Awa Kenzô. Awa taught kyūdō in a way that was regarded by some as a mystical religion, called ''[[Daishadokyo]]''. Daishadokyo was an approach to kyūdō that placed great emphasis on the spiritual aspect and differed from much of the mainstream practice at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Myth of Zen in the Art of Archery | work=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies, 2001, 28/1-2 | url=http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2726|format=PDF| accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1936, Herrigel wrote a 20-page essay about his experiences, and then in 1948 expanded the essay into a short book. The book was translated into English in 1953 and Japanese in 1955.

==Book==
The book sets forth theories about motor learning.  Herrigel has an accepting spirit towards and about unconscious control of outer activity Westerners heretofore considered wholly to be under conscious-waking control and direction.  For example, a central idea in the book is how through years of practice, a physical activity becomes effortless both mentally and physically, as if our habit body executes complex and difficult movements without conscious control from the mind.

Herrigel describes Zen in [[archery]] as follows: &lt;br&gt;
:''"(...) The archer ceases to be conscious of himself as the one who is engaged in hitting the bull's-eye which confronts him. This state of unconscious is realized only when, completely empty and rid of the self, he becomes one with the perfecting of his technical skill, though there is in it something of a quite different order which cannot be attained by any progressive study of the art (...)"''

==Influence==
Herrigel's book may have inspired [[Tim Gallwey]]'s 1974 book ''[[The Inner Game of Tennis]]''.  Both Herrigel and Gallwey approach sport and life as opportunities for learning inner cooperation.  ''Zen in the Art of Archery'' also relates to the "[[inner child]]" idea in [[humanistic psychology]]. Later literature either discusses balancing the "inner game" and the "outer game" or counseling approaches to accessing, communicating and collaborating with the inner child beyond sports.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The title "Zen in the Art of Archery" most likely inspired the titles of many other works, either directly or indirectly. Foremost among these is [[Robert Pirsig]]'s 1974 book ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]''. More than 200 works have been created with similar titles,{{cn|date=September 2018}} including [[Ray Bradbury]]'s 1990 book ''[[Zen in the Art of Writing]]'', as well as ''Zen and the Art of Poker'', ''Zen and the Art of Knitting'', ''[[Crazy Legs Conti: Zen and the Art of Competitive Eating]]'', and so on.

[[J. D. Salinger]]'s fictional character [[Glass family|Seymour Glass]] applied one aspect of Zen archery—aiming by deliberately not taking aim—to playing the children's game of [[marbles]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The wider theme of many of these works is that a regular routine can have a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] dimension.
