'''826 Valencia''' is a non-profit organization in the [[Mission District]] of [[San Francisco]], California, United States, dedicated to helping children and young adults develop writing skills and to helping teachers inspire their students to write. It was the basis for the [[826 National]] organization, which has centers on the [[United States]] with the same goal.

==Overview==
Named for its street address, 826 Valencia was founded in 2002 by author [[Dave Eggers]] and veteran teacher [[Nínive Clements Calegari|Nínive Calegari]], who both have ties to the literary and educational community. 826 consists of a writing lab, a street-front student-friendly pirate supply store that partially funds the programs, and two satellite classrooms in nearby middle schools.

Over 1,400 volunteers—including published authors, magazine founders, SAT-course instructors, and documentary filmmakers—have donated their time to work with thousands of students. These volunteers allow 826 Valencia to offer all of its services for free.&lt;ref name=miller&gt;{{cite news|first=Claire Cain|last=Miller|title=A Genius at Tutoring|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2008/0107/110_print.html|work=Forbes|date=January 7, 2008|accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

826 Valencia opened a satellite location in the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jessica |last=Zack |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/books/article/Beyond-the-bean-Coffee-importer-s-conscience-12526358.php |title=Beyond the bean: Coffee importer’s conscience fuels Eggers’ adventure story |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=January 29, 2018 |orig-year=January 25, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==826 Valencia's programming==
826 Valencia's programming includes:

In-schools programs
* Teams of volunteers visit local high-needs schools around San Francisco to support teachers and provide assistance to students as they tackle various projects, such as school newspapers, research papers, oral histories, and college-entrance essays.

Workshops
* 826 Valencia offers free workshops on weeknights and weekends designed to foster creativity and strengthen writing skills in a variety of genres such as cartooning, college application essay writing, or starting a ’zine. From the playful to the practical, all workshops are project-based and are taught by experienced, accomplished professionals.

Field trips
* Up to four times each week during the school year, 826 Valencia welcomes an entire class into the writing lab for a morning of custom-designed, project-based learning. Students may experience a roundtable discussion with a local author, enjoy an active workshop focused on poetry or journalism, or finalize pieces of writing for publication.

After-school tutoring
* Five days a week, dozens of students of all skill levels and interests come to 826 for free, one-on-one tutoring.  Most of these students are from the predominantly Latino neighborhood in the Mission District, and few speak English at home. When their homework is finished, some children work on extracurricular writing projects; others prefer to grab a book off the shelves and do some quiet reading.

Student publishing
* 826 Valencia publishes an array of student-authored literary journals, newspapers, books, and chapbooks. The largest publishing project each year is the Young Authors’ Book Project. In its seventh year, the project is the culmination of a semester-long collaboration with a local, public, San Francisco high school to write, edit, and design a book that is then published professionally and sold in bookstores nationwide.

==Pirate supply store==
[[File:I'm a pirate and I'm with Coco.jpg|alt=|thumb|The storefront for 826 Valencia's pirate supply store with a sign reading "I'm a pirate and [[I'm with Coco]]!"]]
826 Valencia runs San Francisco's "only independent pirate supply store".  The store is the front entrance of the tutoring center and has the look and feel of an authentic [[pirate]] shop.&lt;ref name=ganahl&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2002/08/02/MN49346.DTL|title=A heartwarming work of literary altruism|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=March 24, 2013|date=August 2, 2002|first=Jane|last= Ganahl}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sells pirate clothing, [[eyepatch]]es, [[compass]]es, spyglasses, pirate [[dice]], [[Jolly Roger|skull flags]], and secret treasures.  It features handmade signs, scattered around the store, offering tongue-in-cheek wisdom, such as "Uses for Lard" (#5: "Lard Fights") and "Guidelines for New Shipmates" (#4: "No forgetting to swab").  Unsuspecting visitors are sometimes treated to surprise "moppings."

Shoppers can also find back issues of [[Timothy McSweeney's Quarterly Concern|''McSweeney's Quarterly Concern'']], books published by [[McSweeney's]], and literary compilations written by 826 Valencia students.  The books of student writing published by 826 Valencia include forewords, illustrations and interviews from public figures such as Former San Francisco mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] and actor [[Robin Williams]].

The Pirate Supply Store was originally created through necessity.  After being turned down for regular use of church basements and school facilities, the founders discovered an empty store on Valencia Street. City ordinances required businesses in that area of the city to be either retail or catering, so the Pirate Supply Store was opened in 2002 as the "legitimate" business front for the writing center. It also helps fund the tutoring program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrea |last=Valencia |url=https://missionlocal.org/2014/07/826-valencia-is-expanding/ |title=826 Valencia is Expanding |newspaper=Mission Local |date=July 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mural==
Dave Eggers commissioned cartoonist [[Chris Ware]] to design the mural for the facade of 826 Valencia's building.&lt;ref name="mural-eye"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=David|title=Chris Ware’s new mural tells the story of the human race|url=http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=87&amp;fid=460|publisher=Eye Magazine|accessdate=27 May 2011|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mural depicts "the parallel development of humans and their efforts at and motivations for communication, spoken and written."&lt;ref name="mural-826"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Façade |url=http://www.826valencia.org/store/facade.html |publisher=826 Valencia |accessdate=27 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727142455/http://www.826valencia.org/store/facade.html |archivedate=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3.9m x 6m mural was applied by artisans to Ware’s specifications.&lt;ref name="mural-eye"/&gt; Describing the work, Ware said "I didn’t want it to make anyone 'feel good', especially in that typically muralistic 'hands across the water' sort of way,"..."I especially wanted it to be something that people living in the neighbourhood could look at day after day and hopefully not tire of too quickly. I really hoped whomever might happen to come across it would find something that showed a respect for their intelligence, and didn’t force-feed them any 'message'."&lt;ref name="mural-eye"/&gt;

==Influence==

{{Main|826 National}}

826 Valencia has inspired a number of other projects across the US, known as 'chapters'. In late 2004, just before the founding of four new chapters, [[826 National]] was launched as an umbrella organization that provides logistical support to its chapters.&lt;ref name=dunkelberger&gt;{{cite news|first=Diane |last=Dunkelberger |title=Conquest of the Word Masters |url=http://www.826valencia.org/press/2006_12.html |work=Benefit Magazine |date=December 1, 2006 |accessdate=March 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620171707/http://www.826valencia.org/press/2006_12.html |archivedate=June 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are now eight chapters that make up 826 National: 826 Valencia, [[826NYC]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[826LA]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[826 Chicago|826CHI]] in [[Chicago]], [[826michigan]] (serving [[Ann Arbor]], [[Detroit]], and [[Ypsilanti]]), [[826 Boston]] in [[Boston]], [[826DC]] in [[Washington, DC]], and most recently, [[826 New Orleans]].

'''Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles''' (also called '''AP CSP''') is an [[AP Computer Science]] course and examination offered by the [[College Board]] to [[high school]] students as an opportunity to earn college credit for a [[college]]-level [[computer science]] course. '''AP Computer Science Principles'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-principles AP Computer Science Principles Home Page], The College Board&lt;/ref&gt; is meant to be the equivalent of a first-semester course in computer science. Assessment for AP Computer Science Principles is divided into two parts, both an end of course exam as well as the creation of artifacts throughout the course.&lt;ref name="apstudent.collegeboard.org"&gt;[https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-principles/about-the-exam AP Computer Science Principles About The Exam Page], The College Board&lt;/ref&gt;

The AP Computer Science Principles Exam was administered for the first time on May 5, 2017.

==Topic Outline==
'''Curriculum Overview'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-curriculum-framework.pdf |title=AP Computer Science Principles: Curriculum Framework 2016-2017 |format=PDF |pages=2–3 |publisher=College Board |date=Fall 2010 |accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The framework focuses on computational thinking practices which are applied throughout the curriculum. The concept outline included in the curriculum is divided into seven units called "Big Ideas". Each unit contains a series of "Learning Objectives". Each "Learning Objective" is a general benchmark of student performance or understanding which has an associated "Enduring Understanding". An "Enduring Understanding" is a core comprehension which students should retain well after completing the course. Each "Learning Objective" is split into multiple "Essential Knowledge" standards, which are specific facts or content which the student must know to demonstrate mastery of the  learning objective when assessed.

{{grading}}

Academic grading in [[South Korea]] depends on the type of school in which it is involved in. In [[University]], the grade runs upon a letter-type grade similar to [[American schools]]. The letter grades can add up to different numbered averages, from 0.0 to 4.5. However, in [[Middle School]], the grades are based on the characters of the Korean language, such as "수" meaning "Outstanding", or "양" meaning "Needs Improvement".

==Middle school==
All Korean Secondary Schools traditionally used to have a five-point [[Grading (education)|grading system]], which was converted from the student's raw score in mid-terms and finals (out of 100).

This system is still used in South Korean Middle Schools.

*A: 90-100%
*B: 80-90%
*C: 70-80%
*D: 60-70%
*E: Below 60%

Students are generally not held back in Korean schools. Thus a grade of 'E' is still a passing grade.

==High school==
In October 2004, the [[ministry of education]] changed the High School academic grading system from absolute to relative evaluation.

The revised grading system provides for 9 ranks based on students' relative standing amongst all others taking the same class that [[semester]].

In 2014, the High School academic grading system was changed to a five-point grading system.

|-
! Aggregate Percentile
|4%||11%||23%||40%||60%||77%||89%||96%||100%
||}

In [[South Korea]], depending on each [[school]], the perfect score is represented as either 4.0, 4.3, or 4.5. The latter is the most commonly used system in the country. Some schools regard A+ and A0 as equal.

Many universities use the following gradations:

[[Category:Academia in South Korea|Grading]]

 What has to be noted is that since high schools are not nationally normalized, this rank is considered relatively depending on what high school one has graduated. For example, most students in 'Specialized high schools': except for arts school(Korean Minjok Leadership Academy, Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies, Cheong Shim international academy, Seoul Science high school, Foreign language high school) show strong academic ability because students who are accepted are selected through competitive entrance exam. Thus, students who get rank 8 or 9 are definitely not considered as a same level student who get 8-9 from normal- state high school. Also meaning normal high school's rank 1 is considered lower than rank 1 from special high schools since its rigorosity and level of classes and course works required for students are different. And this can be proved by their college acceptance results. This system is also applied to grades in colleges too.(Ex. SKY university gpa 3.0 and Kang-won university gpa 3.0 is considered different )</text>

{{grading}}
This article is about the grades that are used in [[Sweden]].

==Primary school==
In the Swedish ''grundskola'' [Kindergarten - Ninth grade] (primary/elementary and secondary/high school, officially called "compulsory school" by [[Skolverket]]), students are currently (December 2012) graded from the sixth grade and onward. Students can be graded:
*A - Exemplary
*B - Excellent
*C - Good
*D - Adequate
*E - Acceptable
*F - Fail, not passed

If a student has not attended enough classes (e.g. due to sickness, late start, truancy), they will instead be marked with an *-, that gives the same points (0p) as an *F, despite not being an actual grade.

A reform was taken into full effect on the beginning of the semester in 2011 which had students graded from the sixth grade, and the grade is more similar to the system of the upper secondary school (''[[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]''), with grades F-A. According to [[Skolverket]], the change is due to a lot of students (~10 %) failing in courses in Swedish, Swedish as a second language, English or mathematics in the 9th year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skolverket.se/kursplaner_och_betyg/2.4122/2.5350/betyg-i-arskurs-6-1.129986 |title=Betyg i årskurs 6 |work=Skolverket.se |publisher=Skolverket |accessdate=17 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026000612/http://www.skolverket.se/kursplaner_och_betyg/2.4122/2.5350/betyg-i-arskurs-6-1.129986 |archivedate=26 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secondary school ==
In the ''[[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' (three-year pre-university course, similar to the UK [[sixth form college]], officially called "upper secondary school" by [[Skolverket]], despite there being no such thing as a "lower secondary school"), the same grading system as the primary school was used until 2011, when it was changed to a six-degree system A-F (A being the highest and F for having failed).&lt;ref name='skolverket'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skolverket.se/forskola_och_skola/gymnasieutbildning/2.2952/bedomning-1.129623 |title=Om gymnasieskolan: Bedömning |work=Skolverket.se |publisher=Skolverket |accessdate=17 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128214725/http://www.skolverket.se/forskola_och_skola/gymnasieutbildning/2.2952/bedomning-1.129623 |archivedate=28 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grades are assigned based on individual achievements rather than relative performance. Formally, the grade should reflect the degree of attainment of stated learning outcomes and objectives.

=== Grade points ===
To easily count an average grade for the student, every grade in its subject gives a certain amount of points. To later use the grades for entrance to a specific program of courses in the Gymnasium, or to the higher educational institutes as the Universities etcetera. To count the average, all the points of the seventeen best grades are count together to then be divided by 17, the number of grades a student can present. Thau the best possible grade, *A, is worth 20 points, the maximum score is 340 points (17 grades x 20 points [The grade of an *A] per grade), or an average score of 20 points, which only is made if the student can show the grade of an *A in all subjects he/she has read during the last semester.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Grade !! Points
|-
| A || 20
|-
| B || 17.5
|-
| C || 15
|-
| D || 12.5
|-
| E || 10
|-
| F || 0
|-
| - || 0
|}

'''This can be shown by the grade forms below;'''

[Bild] Picture &amp; Art= B (17.5)

[Engelska] English= A (20)

[Hemkunskap] Home economics= C (15)

[Idrott] Physical education= B (17.5)

[Matematik] Math= A (20)

[Musik] Music= D (12.5)

[Biologi] Biology= B (17.5)

[Fysik] Physics= A (20)

[Kemi] Chemistry= C (15)

[Historia] History= B (17.5)

[Samhällskunskap] Social studies= A (20)

[Religionskunskap] Religious knowledge= A (20)

[Geografi] Geography= B (17.5)

[Träslöjd/Textilslöjd] Wood work/Needle work= E (10)

[Svenska/Svenska som andraspråk] Swedish/Swedish as a second language= A (20)

[Moderna språk] Foreign languages (French, Spanish, German)= B (17.5)

Which gives a sum of 277.5 points, or an average point of 17.34, which symbolizes the grade of a C, even if you could place it as a weak B (B-), when a B is represented of a grade point of 17.5 or higher. When this grade isn't really that much the grade is counted as the grade below, in this case a C, which is represented by 15 points or higher.
 
If the student has parents from, or was born in a foreign country, he or she has the right to get education in his or her native language and also gets a valid grade in that language. Because you can only file 16 grades this gives the student the opportunity to choose which subject not to count, possibly the worst. Depending on schools the students can study another subject (Technics, Languages etc.), where the same procedure is used to file only the allowed 16 grades.

=== Historically ===

==== 1996–2010 ====
From 1996 to 2010, grades ranged from "IG", "G", "VG", to "MVG" ("IG" being failed). This was changed in the secondary school reforms of 2011, primarily to make the distinction of grades clearer and to make the grading of students fairer.&lt;ref name='skolverket'/&gt; The IG-MVG system was translated into a numerical GPA like number for application purposes etc., where MVG equaled 20.0, VG 15.0, G 10.0 and IG 0 and the highest achievable GPA thus being 20.0.  This system is still (2013) in use for students who started their secondary school with these grades.

==== 20th century ====
Until 1996 relative grades on the scale 1-5 were used, with 5 being the highest grade. The scale was intended to follow a [[normal distribution]] on a national level, with a mean of 3 and a [[standard deviation]] of 1.

Up until 1962 yet another scale was used:

*A - ''Berömlig'' (Excellent)
*a - ''Med utmärkt beröm godkänd ''(Passed with great credit)
*AB - ''Med beröm godkänd'' (Passed with credit)
*Ba - ''Icke utan beröm godkänd'' (Passed, not without credit)
*B - ''Godkänd'' (Passed)
*Bc - ''Icke fullt godkänd'' (Not entirely passable)
*C - ''Underkänd'' (Fail)
*D - "Klandervärt" (Humiliation)

Though unused for over 40 years, this scale retains some cultural significance, and the standard [[law school]] grading scale used today is based on it (see below).

==University level==
On [[university]] level the following standard grading scale has been defined:

*VG - ''Väl godkänd'' (Passed with distinction)
*G - ''Godkänd'' (Passed)
*U - ''Underkänd'' (Fail)

As long as relative grading is not used, however, individual universities may choose to use any other scale. For example, in the fields of [[engineering]] and [[technology]], the passing grades of VG and G are commonly replaced with 5, 4 and 3, whereas [[law school]]s consistently employ a scale of AB, Ba and B as passing grades. Further, a number of universities are currently in the process of transitioning to an [[ECTS grading scale|ECTS]] based scale, with an A to F grading, pursuant to the [[Bologna process]]. Many universities (e.g. [[KTH]] and [[Stockholm University]]) finished the transition  process in 2007 or 2008.

Prior to transitioning to the Bologna Process, the private university [[Stockholm School of Economics]] (Sw. Handelshögskolan i Stockholm) adopted its own grading scale:

* B - "Berömlig" (Excellent)
* MBG - "Med Beröm Godkänd" (Passed with distinction)
* G - "Godkänd" (Passed)

where B corresponded to a &gt;=85% score, MBG &gt;= 70% and G &gt;= 50%.

After spring 2016 all new students enrolled at the Stockholm School of Economics follow a new grading scale:
*80%- '''Utmärkt''' (Excellent)
*70-79%- '''Mycket Väl Godkänd''' (Very Good)
*60-69%- '''Väl Godkänd''' (Good)
*50-59%- '''Godkänd''' (Pass)

'''ACSL''', or the '''American Computer Science League''', is an international [[computer science]] competition among more than 300 [[school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.acsl.org/|title = American Computer Science League|date = |accessdate = November 13, 2014|website = |publisher = American Computer Science League|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally founded in 1978 as the Rhode Island Computer Science League, it then became the New England Computer Science League.  With countrywide and worldwide participants, it became the American Computer Science League.  It has been in continuous existence since 1978.  
Each yearly competition consists of four contests. All students at each school may compete but the team score is the sum of the best 3 or 5 top scores.  Each contest consists of two parts: a written section (called "shorts") and a programming section.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.acsl.org/acsl/02-03/works.htm|title = How ACSL Works.|date = |accessdate = November 13, 2014|website = |publisher = American Computer Science League|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Written topics tested include "what does this program do?", [[digital electronics]], [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], [[computer numbering formats|computer numbering systems]], [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive function]]s, [[data structures]] (primarily dealing with [[Heap (data structure)|heaps]],  [[binary search tree]]s, [[stack (data structure)|stacks]], and [[Queue (data structure)|queues]]), [[Lisp programming language|lisp programming]], [[regular expressions]] and [[Finite state machine|Finite State Automata]], bit string flicking, [[graph theory]], [[assembly language|assembly programming]] and [[prefix notation|prefix]]/[[postfix notation|postfix]]/[[infix notation|infix]] notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.acsl.org/acsl/14-15/Categories.htm|title = Categories|date = |accessdate = November 13, 2014|website = |publisher =American Computer Science League |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions==
There are five divisions in ACSL: Elementary, Classroom, Junior, Intermediate, and Senior.  The Elementary Division is a non-programming competition for grades 3 - 6.  It tests one topic per contest.  The Classroom Division is a non-programming competition for all grades and consists of a 10 question test on 4 topics each contest. Junior Division is recommended for middle school students (no students above the ninth grade may compete in it).  Intermediate and Senior Divisions are for secondary school students, Intermediate being easier and Senior being more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.acsl.org/acsl/11-12/divisions.htm|title = Divisions|date = |accessdate = November 13, 2014|website = |publisher = American Computer Science League|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the All-Star Contest, the Junior teams consist of 5 members each while the Senior and Intermediate teams can consist of 3 or 5 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://acsl.org/acsl/14-15/FAQ_1.pdf|title = Frequently Asked Questions|date = |accessdate = November 13, 2014|website = |publisher = American Computer Science League|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each team competes against other same-sized teams in its division.

==Regular Season==
The Regular Season, in which individual students compete to get their school team qualified for the All-Star Contest, consists of four rounds.  These rounds consist of a programming part and a written part.  In the programming part, students have 72 hours to complete a program in any [[computer language]] to perform the given task.  In the written part, students have a total of 30 minutes to answer 5 questions based on given topics.  Students then receive a score of up to 10 points (5 for written and 5 for programming).  For the Classroom Division, students receive 45 minutes to solve 10 written problems. For the Elementary Division, students have 30 minutes to solve 5 written problems. Prizes are awarded to top scoring teams and students based upon cumulative scores after the fourth contest.

==All-Star Contest==
The All-Star Contest is held at a different location every year.  Teams are given 4 hours to earn up to 60 (40 for Junior Division) points by successfully completing various programs.  Individuals are then given 1 hour (45 minutes for Junior Division) to take a 12 (8 for Junior Division) question multiple choice test based on the categories of the written questions in the Regular Season rounds.  The scores of the programming and the team's individual scores are added together to determine the winners.  Prizes are given to teams with the highest scores and individuals based on their performance on the multiple choice test.

'''Ana Lara''' (born 30 November 1959) is a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] composer.

== Life ==
Ana Lara was born in [[Mexico City]] and studied at the National Conservatory of Music with [[Mario Lavista]] and [[Daniel Catán]] and later with [[Fredrico Ibarra]]. She continued her studies at the [[Warsaw]] Academy of Music with [[Zbigniew Rudzinski]] and [[Wlodzimierz Kotonski]]. She also studied ethnomusicology at the [[University of Maryland]], graduating with a Master of Arts degree.

After completing her studies, Lara worked as a composer and music producer. In 1989 she began producing a Mexico City University Radio (Radio UNAM) contemporary music program, and in 2000 she was nominated as Best Classical Album Producer at the [[Latin Grammy Awards]]. She founded and served as artistic director of Mexico's International Festival Música y Escena, and served as artistic director of the Puebla Instrumenta Verano 2004 summer courses. She also teaches music and seminars on Latin American and twentieth century music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peermusicclassical.com/composer/composerdetail.cfm?detail=lara|title=Ana Lara|accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvoQQU1QL_QC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;dq=Ana+Lara+composer&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5p0cTcLNKM6s8AaP58W7Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ana%20Lara%20composer&amp;f=false|title=The Norton/Grove dictionary of women composers|format=Digitized online by GoogleBooks|first=Julie Anne|last=Sadie|first2=Rhian|last2=Samuel|year=1994|accessdate=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the years, the Forum offered a wide-ranging program of classes, public lectures and seminars, art exhibitions, performances, popular education workshops, and language classes.&lt;ref&gt;http://brechtforum.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiserearth.org/organization/view/201f9c1414e009be165d780fc0c1707c&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://brechtforum.org/nyms {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221040405/http://brechtforum.org/nyms |date=2010-02-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brecht Forum closed in 2014. Many of the teachers and activists from the Forum have continued offering classes and discussions through the Marxist Education Project, which was founded following the Forum's closure and operates out of the Brooklyn Commons in the [[Boerum Hill]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecommonsbrooklyn.org/content/marxist-education-project |title=The Marxist Education Project — The Brooklyn Commons |publisher=The Brooklyn Commons |access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marxedproject.org/our-legacy/ |title=Our Legacy — Marxist Education Project |access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Brecht Forum was founded in 1975, as the New York Marxist School by a collective of civil rights, community, labor, and student activists.&lt;ref&gt;http://brechtforum.org/nyms {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221040405/http://brechtforum.org/nyms |date=2010-02-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, it moved to [[Westbeth Artists Community|Westbeth]], 451 West St., [[New York, NY]],&lt;ref&gt;http://events.nbcnewyork.com/new-york-ny/venues/show/46982-brecht-forum{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly Serge’s Gym where its program also included the [[Theater of the Oppressed]] Laboratory,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spunk.org/texts/art/sp000338.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toplab.org/lababout.htm|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630000519/http://www.toplab.org/lababout.htm|archivedate=2007-06-30|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2009-06-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Institute for Popular Education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycore.org/itags.html|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619183022/http://www.nycore.org/itags.html|archivedate=2009-06-19|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2009-06-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Neues Kabarett series..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ny.com/health/fitness/| title=NYC Fitness Clubs|accessdate=June 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, it moved to the Commons in Brooklyn at 338 Atlantic Avenue, where its successor organization, the Marxist Education Project, now hosts many events each year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.librarything.com/venue/17671/Brecht-Forum&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/entity.php?id%3D4422 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061122125836/http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/entity.php?id=4422 |archivedate=2006-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://newyork.timeout.com/venues/west-village/1187/the-brecht-forum| title=The Brecht Forum| work=Music, Time Out New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brecht Forum's website is being maintained as an archive at brechtforum.net.

This is a list of the different '''copyright policies of [[academic publisher]]s'''. Traditionally, the author of an article was required to transfer the [[copyright]] to the journal publisher. Publishers claimed this was necessary in order to protect [[author's rights]], and to coordinate permissions for reprints or other use. However, many authors, especially those active in the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] movement, found this unsatisfactory,&lt;ref name=Di_Cosmo&gt;{{Cite journal
| issn = 1684-5285
| volume = 7
| issue = 3
| pages = 41–8
| last = Di Cosmo

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have used their influence to effect a gradual move towards a license to publish instead. Under such a system, the publisher has permission to edit, print, and distribute the article commercially, but the author(s) retain the other rights themselves.

Even if they retain the copyright to an article, most journals allow certain rights to their authors. These rights usually include the ability to reuse parts of the paper in the author's future work, and allow the author to distribute  a limited number of copies. In the print format, such copies are called reprints; in the electronic format, they are called [[postprints]]. Some publishers, for example the [[American Physical Society]], also grant the author the right to post and update the article on the author's or employer's website and on free e-print servers, to grant permission to others to use or reuse figures, and even to reprint the article as long as no fee is charged.&lt;ref name="forms"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forms.aps.org/author/copyfaq.html |title=APS Copyright Policies and Frequently Asked Questions}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rise of [[open access journals]], in which the author retains the copyright but sometimes needs to pay a [[Article Processing Charge|publication charge]], such as the [[Public Library of Science]] family of journals, is another recent response to copyright concerns.

== American Institute of Physics  ==
The [[American Institute of Physics]] requires the transfer of copyright from the authors, but allows the authors to post and update an article:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web posting guidelines|url=http://www.aip.org/pubservs/web_posting_guidelines.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* files prepared and/or formatted by AIP (e.g. the published PDF) on the authors webpage, as long as no fee is charged, and a copyright notice, a link and a bibliographical citation are included;
* author-prepared files only (i.e. not the published PDF) on free-access E-print servers.

"AIP Advances" authors may make their work available according to the terms of the [[Creative Commons License|Creative Commons 3.0 Unported License]].

== American Physical Society ==
The [[American Physical Society]] requires the transfer of copyright from the authors to the Society.
It allows the authors to:&lt;ref name="forms" /&gt;
* Distribute [[preprints]] (author prepared files), on the authors website or on preprint servers.
* Distribute other versions, including the final and further updates, on the authors website or on preprint servers, as long as they were prepared and formatted by the author (i.e. not the PDF prepared by APS).
* Distribute the published version (i.e. the PDF prepared by APS), in the authors website as long as no fee is charged.
A citation and notice of the APS copyright must be included.

== Nature Publishing Group ==
The [[Nature Publishing Group]] does not require the transfer of copyright from the authors. It allows the authors to:
*  to submit the author's version of the accepted paper (the unedited manuscript) to a funding body's archive, their institution's repositories, or their personal websites, for public release six months after publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=License to publish: authors &amp; referees @ npg|url=http://www.nature.com/authors/policies/license.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They state:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nature Copyright permissions page|url=http://www.nature.com/reprints/permission-requests.html|publisher=Nature Pub.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation | Since 2003, ownership of copyright in original research articles remains with the Authors*, and provided that, when reproducing the Contribution or extracts from it, the Authors acknowledge first and reference publication in the Journal, the Authors retain the following non-exclusive rights:
To reproduce the Contribution in whole or in part in any printed volume (book or thesis) of which they are the author(s).

==The Dental Schools Council History==
The Dental Schools Council began life as the ''Education Consultative Committee of the Dental Schools of Great Britain'' on 31 January 1931 when Mr W. Malcolm Knott (President of the [[British Dental Association]] in 1930) invited several Dental Deans to come together to discuss the formation of a Dental School Committee to discuss all matters relating to dental [[education]]. Twelve [[dental school]]s were represented at the first meeting, with each member donating one guinea to cover expenses. The first topic discussed was the recommendation of a [[General Medical Council]] to maintain dental standards in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J.J. |last=Murray |date=24 March 2007 |title=The Council of Heads and Deans of Dental Schools: 75 years |journal=[[British Dental Journal]] |volume=202 |issue=6 |pages=331–334 |pmid=17384612 |doi=10.1038/bdj.2007.226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Education Consultative Committee of the Dental Schools of Great Britain enabled the university staff to play a greater role in determining, co-ordinating and agreeing standards in the dental curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Noble.

==Previous names==
The Dental Schools Council has been referred to under many names since its formation. In 1932, a formal [[constitution]] was approved resulting in a new name - ''The Dental Education Advisory Committee of Great Britain and Ireland'', which was later changed in 1937 to the ''Dental Education Advisory Council of Great Britain and Ireland'' (DEAC). In order to align itself with the Council of Heads of Medical Schools - now the ''[[Medical Schools Council]]'' - the DEAC changed its name in 1993 to the ''Council of Deans of Dental Schools'' (CDDS).  However, it was later decided in 2005 that it was necessary to change the name to ''Council of Heads and Deans of Dental Schools'' to reflect that not all members of the organisation were given the title ‘[[Dean (education)|Dean]]’.  2008 saw a final name change to the ''Dental Schools Council'' to reflect the expertise at all levels within the dental schools, from not only the Heads and Deans but also other dedicated staff members including admissions [[tutor]]s, [[Academic administration|administrators]] and [[students]] themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Dental Schools Council. http://www.dentalschoolscouncil.ac.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

==Senior Officers Group==
In 2007, the UK Dental Schools Senior Officers Group was convened, fostering formal and regular dialogue on key issues between Dental Schools across the UK at Senior Administrator Level. The Senior Officers Group meet twice a year in February and October (as a joint meeting with the Dental Schools Council). The current Chair is Anna Burrows, Senior Administrator at the [[University of Sheffield]] School of Clinical Dentistry.&lt;ref&gt;Sheffield School of Clinical Dentistry http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dentalschool/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3427">'''Douglas Dunlop''' was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] teacher and missionary who, during the British occupation of [[Egypt]] (1888–1922), controversially created what became known as the 'Dunlop-system' in Egyptian education. He was widely seen as an opponent of Egyptian nationalist aspirations in education.

From 1882-1922, Egypt was under [[British Armed Forces|British military]] occupation, and her government heavily under the influence (control) of the [[British Empire]]. The first [[List of colonial heads of Egypt|Consul-General]], [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Sir Evelyn Baring]] (later 1st [[Earl of Cromer]]), appointed Dunlop as British 'consultant' to the Egyptian ministry of education. Dunlop was suggested for this task by Cromer's former tennis partner.

Dunlop and the British had two concerns. Firstly, they were concerned with the debt-ridden Egyptian economy, and secondly with creating a suitable (and compliant) educated governing class and [[civil service]], modelled on their experiences in [[British India]]. The education policy of the Egyptian government prior to the occupation had been to create a meritocratic system. Dunlop, on the other hand, oversaw the creation of an elitist two-tier system, with fees introduced for the elite schools. Modernisation also occurred, with elemental schooling being both centralised and expanded. 

Prior to the British occupation, the administrative [[languages of Egypt]] had been French and Turkish. With British influence, [[English language|English]] became the preferred language. This brought increasing controversy, as Egyptian nationalists sought to reassert [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Dunlop, even after thirty years in Egypt, like Cromer, did not speak Arabic. He primarily promoted teaching in English, preferring to employ British teachers and attempting to marginalise teaching in Arabic and French.  

In 1907, [[Saad Zaghlul]] (later revolutionary leader and post-independence prime minister) became minister of education. Zaghul strongly promoted Arabic in education, and necessarily locking horns with his British advisor. Dunlop became a figure associated with British resistance to Egyptian [[anti-colonialism]]. Dunlop quit his post during the [[Egyptian revolution of 1919]].

'''Humberto''' (PFLC) is a high school in [[Tijuana]], north-west Mexico.

==History==
With the city of Tijuana already undergoing fast development, especially as a strategically located border town between the U.S. and México back in the middle of the 1900s, the need for higher education for its fast growing population soon became imminent; the need to offer post-secondary studies spurred the creation of the first high school ('preparatoria' as it is called in México) in the region, this at a time when Baja California was still considered as a territory (and therefore highly dependent upon the federal government regarding its governance and administration), before becoming a proper 'State' of Mexico. In 1946 a group of nine students started their studies in an education center that now caters for more than 4,500 students.

==Origins==
The school was founded based on Federal Cooperation on September 2, 1946, within the premises of the "Alvaro Obregon" School, situated at the southwest hillside part of Tijuana, nowadays site of The House of Culture, by its founder, Professor Rosas Garcia Jose Efrain, named as the first director of the Federal High School in operation there. In 1950 he moved together with the Secondary Studies section to the Centro Escolar de Agua Caliente to merge this with the Industrial Technical Institute on the same site. The educational complex got initiated by a group of local teachers and professionals, led by Professor Rosas Garcia Jose Efrain. Teachers pioneered by Rosas Garcia Jose Efrain, and Angel Morales Barraza, Angel Ruiz Ojeda, Alfonso Gómez Pereira, Gabriel Moreno Lozano, Maximum Argout, Luis Torres Coto, Margarita Ruiz Diaz, Ildefonso Corella and Tiburcio Gómez Alatorre . Subsequently joined by others like Miguel Bargalló Ardévosol, Maria Luisa Bargalló, Guillermo Caballero Sosa, Julio Torres Coto, Froylan Esparza , Jose Alberich, Aurelio Magro, Antonio Blanco and González Atenogenes.

===1960s===
In 1960 the High School joined the Universidad Autonoma de Baja California (UABC), thus giving birth to the University being implemented in the Coastal Zone, without losing its dependence from the Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP). In 1961 a divergent movement arose that resulted in the first semester of a school year ending in June, resuming activities with a second semester starting in September, later in the same calendar year{{Clarify|date=June 2011}}.

===1970s===
In 1971 the school adopted the name 'Lázaro Cárdenas', after the former Mexican president famous for, amongst other measures, the nationalization of the oil industry and largely improving and expanding education throughout the country, who had died on October 19, 1970.

In 1972 major changes set educational standards such as:
* Plan of study of 6 semesters
* The morning shift
* Pioneering the specialized skills programs in ten different professional areas.

====Federalization Decree====

'Sure, from this moment this is a federalized High School!' was the response given by the President of Mexico, Luis Echeverria Alvarez, to the pledge posed to him with a blanket by a large crowd of students on the night of December 2, 1973, at the school's 'Salvador Allende' Civic Plaza{{Clarify|date=June 2011}}.

With the arrival of Professor Jesus Ruiz Barraza, a series of measures were taken which transformed the school from a small provincial one to a large  high school {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. In 1972, within the context of educational reform set forth by president Echeverria's government, the school was incorporated into the 'National Association of Universities and Institutions of Higher Education' classification (ANUIES), abandoning the two-year plan in use since 1946, and supplying a three-year high school education program providing real job training in various professional specialties.

Before 1972 classes where held only in the evening in limited-space premises known as High School 19. Due to the constantly growing demand of students seeking high school education, Barraza pointed to the need for a morning school shift. With limited resources additional classrooms were built, allowing enrollment  to increase to just over 1,000 'preparatoria' students. President Echeverría granted the request and, in May 1972, a group of students invited the president, while visiting the city, to see the school's facilities.

Students and campus leaders were asking for laboratories, classrooms and sports fields and, most importantly the federalization of the school; President Echeverria fulfilled the request, and awarded two million pesos for the construction of an all-new building. From then onwards the school ceased to be funded by its students, and joined the federation.

During another visit to Tijuana on 2 December 1973, President Echeverria inaugurated the new facilities and publicly declared the official federalization of the school.

From that point, the school became a member institution of the Federal Education System thus receiving federal financial funding for its operations, staff, maintenance and expansion of facilities. The school's graduates have a statistically higher than average performance record in Tijuana and the state of Baja California, and Mexico, in general{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}.

===1980s===

The school started offering a high school program for employed adults in a late shift in 1983.

==International Baccalaureate==
Authorized to offer the IB Diploma Programme since November,'''1982'''.
The program is taught in Spanish. But students are also required to master the English language, on an 80% minimum ratio.
Students at this school usually enroll for the examinations of the [[International Baccalaureate|IB]] of the call in May.
The [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) aims to develop young caring, informed and eager for knowledge, who help to create a better and more peaceful world in the context of mutual understanding and intercultural respect.

In pursuit of this objective, the organization works with schools, governments and international organizations to develop challenging programs of international education and demanding rigorous assessment.

{{for|the form of digital memory sometimes called a "flash card"|Memory card}}
[[Image:Flashcard.png|230px|thumb|A set of flashcards demonstrating the [[Leitner system]]. Cards that the learner knows are promoted to a box for less frequent review (indicated by green arrows); cards for which the learner has forgotten the meaning are demoted to be studied more frequently (indicated by red arrows).]]

A '''flashcard''' or '''flash card''' is a card bearing [[information]], as words or numbers, on either or both sides, used in classroom drills or in private study. One writes a question on a side and an answer overleaf. Flashcards can bear [[vocabulary]], historical dates, formulae or any subject matter that can be learned via a question-and-answer format. Flashcards are widely used as a [[learning]] drill to aid [[Memory|memorization]]. They are often associated with [[spaced repetition]], i.e. reviewed at expanding time intervals.

Flashcards can be virtual, as those used by [[list of flashcard software|flashcard software]], or physical.

Flashcards are an application of the [[testing effect]] − the finding that [[long-term memory]] is increased when some of the learning period is devoted to retrieving the information through testing with proper feedback.

== Use ==
[[File:Anki flashcard question and answer math.gif|thumb|Example of a virtual flashcard: using [[list of flashcard software|flashcard software]] [[Anki (software)|Anki]] to review a mathematical formula. First, only the question is displayed. Then the answer is displayed too, for verification.]]
Flashcards exercise the mental process of [[active recall]]: given a prompt (the question), one produces the answer. Beyond the content of cards, which are collected in '''decks''', there is the question of ''use'' – how does one use the cards, in particular, how frequently does one review (more finely, how does one ''schedule'' review) and how does one react to errors, either complete failures to recall or mistakes? Various [[#Systems|systems]] have been developed, mostly based around [[spaced repetition]] – increasing the time intervals between reviews whenever a card is recalled correctly.

=== Two-sided ===
Physical flashcards are two-sided; in some context one wishes to correctly produce the opposite side on being presented with either side, such as in foreign language vocabulary; in other context one is content to go in only one direction, such as in producing a poem given its title or [[incipit]] ('''opening'''). For physical flashcards, one may either use a single card, flipping it according to the direction, or two parallel decks, such as one English-Japanese and one Japanese-English. They have a number of uses that can be very simple or very elaborate for the person to memorize.

== Systems ==
{{see also|Spaced repetition}}
There are various systems for using flashcards, many based around the principle of [[spaced repetition]] – reviewing information at increasing intervals. Manually managing interval length can add greatly to the overhead of using flashcards: the [[Leitner system]] is a simple spaced repetition system designed for paper flashcards, based on a small number of boxes and a simple algorithm, while the [[SuperMemo]] algorithms are more complicated, tracking each card individually, and designed for implementation by computer.

==Three-sided cards==
Physical flashcards are necessarily two-sided. A variant, found in electronic flashcards, is what is known as a '''three-sided card'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnemosyne-proj.org/help/adding-media.php Adding images, sounds, mathematical formulas, and three-sided cards] on [[Mnemosyne (software)|The Mnemosyne Project]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a particular kind of asymmetric two-sided card; abstractly, such a card has three fields, Q, A, A*, where Q &amp; A are reversed on flipping, but A* is always in the answer – the two "sides" are thus Q/A,A* and A/Q,A*. Concretely, these are most used for learning foreign vocabulary where the foreign pronunciation is not transparent from the foreign writing – in this case the Question is the native word, the Answer is the foreign word (written), and the pronunciation is always part of the answer (Answer*). This is particularly the case for [[Chinese character]]s, as in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[hanzi]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[kanji]], but can also be used for other non-phonetic spellings, including [[English as a second language]].

===Examples===
An English-speaking student learning the Chinese word [[wikt:人#Mandarin|人]] (rén, person):
:Q: person
:A: 人, rén
Reverse:
:Q: 人
:A: rén, person
Or a French student learning the English word  "[[wikt:enough|enough]]" (''[[wikt:assez|assez]]'' in French). Due to the irregular pronunciation of the -ough, the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] pronunciation is given along with the word itself.
:Q: assez
:A: enough {{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|n|ʌ|f}}
Reverse:
:Q: enough
:A: assez

===Purpose===
The purpose of three-sided cards is to provide the benefits of two-sided cards – ease of authoring (enter data once to create two cards), synchronized updates (changes to one are reflected in the other), and spacing between opposite sides (so opposite sides of the same card are not tested too close together) – without the card needing to be symmetric.

One can generalize this principle to an arbitrary number of data fields associated with a single record, with each field representing a different aspect of a fact or bundle of facts.

==Software==
{{main article|List of flashcard software}}
There is a wide range of software (including open source and online services) available for creating and using virtual flashcards as an aid to learning.

==History==
Paper flashcards have been used since at least the 19th century, with ''Reading Disentangled'' (1834), a set of [[phonics]] flashcards by English educator [[Favell Lee Mortimer]] being credited by some as the first flashcards.&lt;ref&gt;''The Clumsiest People in Europe: Or, Mrs. Mortimer's Bad-Tempered Guide to the Victorian World,'' [[Favell Lee Mortimer]], foreword by Todd Pruzan, 2006 edition, [https://books.google.com/books?id=B_AC9ae6lzkC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=favell+mortimer+flashcards p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, a single-sided [[hornbook]] had been used for early literacy education.

The [[Leitner system]] for scheduling flashcards was introduced by German scientific journalist [[Sebastian Leitner]] in the 1970s, specifically his 1972 ''So lernt man lernen. Der Weg zum Erfolg (How to learn to learn),''&lt;ref&gt;''So lernt man lernen. Der Weg zum Erfolg (How to learn to learn),'' Freiburg i. Br. 1972/2003, {{ISBN|3-451-05060-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[SuperMemo]] program and algorithm (specifically the SM-2 algorithm, which is the most popular in other programs) was introduced on December 13, 1987 by Polish researcher [[Piotr Woźniak (researcher)|Piotr Woźniak]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/beginning.htm 3. Account of research leading to the SuperMemo method, 3.1. The approximate function of optimal intervals] and [http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm 3.2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3174">'''Johann Ludwig Friedrich Lahrs''' (11 July 1880 &amp;ndash; 13 March 1964) was a [[Germany|German]] [[architect]] and professor.

==Life==

Lahrs was born in [[Königsberg]], [[East Prussia]]. After attending the [[Löbenicht Realgymnasium]], Lahrs studied at the [[Technical University of Berlin|Technical University in Charlottenburg]] in 1898. He worked in [[Berlin]] and Charlottenburg until 1908; in 1906 he was awarded the Schinkelpreis in honor of [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]. In 1908 Lahrs began working at the [[Kunstakademie Königsberg|Kunstakademie]] in his native Königsberg. He served as architectural professor at the Kunstakademie from 1911 to 1934.

Lahrs' most prominent designs included the [[Kunsthalle Königsberg|Kunsthalle]] (completed 1913) in [[Tragheim]] and the new Kunstakademie (completed 1919) after it moved to [[Ratshof]]. In 1920 Lahrs and [[Stanislaus Cauer]] designed a memorial in the Gemeindefriedhof cemetery near [[Rothenstein (Königsberg)|Rothenstein]] and [[Maraunenhof]]; the memorial honored 200 workers killed in a munitions explosion in Rothenstein.

Lahrs also designed the new mausoleum for [[Immanuel Kant]] near [[Königsberg Cathedral]] in 1924. In the same year he designed a regimental memorial at [[Brandenburg Gate (Kaliningrad)|Brandenburg Gate]] honoring casualties from Königsberg's foot artillery during [[World War I]]. In 1926 he led an excavation of the courtyard of [[Königsberg Castle]]. Two years later he designed the provincial finance office, the Landesfinanzamt, just outside [[Neurossgarten]]. Lahrs also designed the bookstore Gräfe und Unzer.

Lahrs remained at the Kunstakademie until 1934, when he retired his professorship after the appointment of [[Kurt Frick]] to the academy during ''[[Gleichschaltung]]''. Lahrs was married to Maria Lahrs, a painter and silhouette artist, with whom he had three daughters. After being [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–1950)|expelled]] from Königsberg in 1945 as a result of [[World War II]], Lahrs settled in [[Stuttgart]]. In 1956 he published ''Das Königsberger Schloß'', an architectural history of Königsberg Castle. Lahrs died in 1964 after an auto accident in Stuttgart.

[[File:JaneJoseph.jpg|thumb|Jane Joseph, photographed around 1920]]
'''Jane Marian Joseph''' (31 May 1894&amp;nbsp;– 9 March 1929) was an English composer, arranger and music teacher. She was a pupil and later associate of the composer [[Gustav Holst]], and was closely concerned in the organisation and management of various of the music festivals which Holst sponsored. Many of her works were composed for performance at these festivals and similar occasions. Her early death, which prevented the full realisation of her talents, was considered by her contemporaries as a considerable loss to English music.

Holst first observed Joseph's potential when he was teaching  her composition at [[St Paul's Girls' School]]. She began to act as his [[amanuensis]] in 1914, when he was composing ''[[The Planets]]'', her special responsibility being the preparation of the score for the "Neptune" movement. She continued to assist Holst with transcriptions, arrangements and translations, and was his librettist for the choral ballet ''The Golden Goose''. During her short professional life she became an active member of the [[Society of Women Musicians]], was the prime mover behind the first Kensington Musical Competition Festival, and helped to found the Kensington Choral Society.  She also taught music at a girls' school, where  Holst's daughter [[Imogen Holst|Imogen]] was one of her pupils, and became a leading figure in the musical life of [[Morley College]].

Much of Joseph's compositional [[Work of art|oeuvre]] was never published and has been lost. Of her published works, two early short orchestral pieces, ''Morris Dance'' and ''Bergamask'' won considerable critical praise, although neither became part of the general orchestral repertory.  Two choral works, ''A Festival Venite'' and ''A Hymn for Whitsuntide'' were admired during her lifetime, but seldom performed thereafter. Her carol "A Little Childe There is Ibore" was thought by Holst to be among the best of its kind. In the eight decades after her death there were no commercial recordings of Joseph's music,{{refn|The [[British Library Sound Archive]] collection contains a single recording of Joseph's: the carol "A Little Childe There is Ibore", probably derived from a 1995 BBC broadcast.

==Biography==

===Family background and early childhood===
Jane Joseph was born on 31 May 1894 at 23 Clanricarde Gardens, in the [[Notting Hill]] district of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Kensington|Borough of Kensington]], London, to a prosperous Jewish family. Her father, George Solomon Joseph (1844–1917),  a [[solicitor]] in his family's firm, had married Henrietta, née Franklin (1861–1938) in 1880. Jane was their fourth child; the youngest of her three brothers was seven years older than her. George Joseph had a deep interest in music, which he passed on to his children; two   sons, Frank  (1881–1944) and Edwin (1887–1975), became competent string players, while Jane learned piano (she took her first examination at the age of seven) and later, double-bass. In time, Frank's musical children, with Jane and friends, formed the basis of a "Josephs orchestra" that performed concerts at Frank's home for many years.&lt;ref name= Gibbs99&gt;{{cite journal|last= Gibbs|first= Alan|title= The Music of Jane Joseph|jstor= 946669|journal= Tempo|issue= 299|date= July 1999|pages=14–18}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs 2000, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

===St Paul's Girls' School and Gustav Holst===
[[File:Holst-by-rothenstein-1920.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Holst, as drawn by [[William Rothenstein]]]]
In 1909 Joseph won a scholarship to [[St Paul's Girls' School]] (SPGS) in [[Hammersmith]].&lt;ref name= G26&gt;Gibbs 2000, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The school had opened in 1904, as an offshoot of the long-established [[St Paul's School, London|St Paul's School]] for boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= History of the School|url=http://spgs.org/about/history/ |publisher= St Paul's Girls' School|accessdate= 8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its high mistress, Frances Ralph Gray, was a formidable figure with traditional views about female education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Coutts|first= Elizabeth|title= Gray, Frances Ralph|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/48642|work= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|edition=online|year= 2004|accessdate= 30 April 2013}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; who nevertheless provided a lively and varied learning environment in which Joseph excelled.  Apart from her academic successes, Joseph played double-bass in the school orchestra,&lt;ref name= Gibbs99/&gt; gave an acclaimed piano performance of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s [[D minor]] keyboard concerto, began to compose, and won a prize for [[sight-reading]].&lt;ref name= G26/&gt; While at the school she composed "The Carrion Crow", a song setting which, in 1914, became her first published work.&lt;ref name= G28&gt;Gibbs 2000, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Outside music she supported the school's Literary Society, where she presented papers on [[Charlotte Brontë]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]. She also won Honours in the examinations of the [[Royal Drawing Society]].&lt;ref name= G26/&gt;

Among the music teachers at SPGS, most significantly in terms of her musical development, Joseph encountered the emergent composer [[Gustav Holst]], then little known, who taught her composition. After leaving the [[Royal College of Music]] in 1898 Holst had earned his living as an organist, and as a trombonist in various orchestras, while awaiting critical recognition as a composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matthews|first=Colin|title=Holst, Gustav|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/13252|publisher= Grove Music Online|accessdate=22 March 2013|authorlink=Colin Matthews}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903 he gave up his orchestral appointments to concentrate on composing, but found that he needed a regular income. He became a music teacher, initially at the [[James Allen's Girls' School]] in [[Dulwich]];&lt;ref&gt;Short, pp. 50–53&lt;/ref&gt; in 1905 he was recommended to Frances Gray by Adine O'Neill, a former pupil of [[Clara Schumann]], who taught piano at SPGS.&lt;ref&gt;Short, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; He was first appointed on a part-time basis to teach singing, and later extended his activities to cover the school's wider music curriculum including conducting and composition.&lt;ref&gt;Short, p. 57 and p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; According to the composer Alan Gibbs, Joseph quickly came under Holst's spell, and adopted his principles as her own.&lt;ref name= Gibbs99/&gt; Holst later described her as the best girl pupil he ever had: "From the first she showed an individual attitude of mind and an eagerness to absorb all that was beautiful".&lt;ref name= MMR&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink= Gustav Holst|last= Holst|first= Gustav|title= Jane Joseph: A brief discussion of her published music|url= http://landofllostcontent.blogspot.co.uk/2009/08/jane-joseph-brief-discussion-of-her.html|journal= The Monthly Musical Record|date= April 1931|pages=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

===Student, scribe and teacher, 1913–1918===

====Girton====
[[File:Girton College, Cambridge, England, 1890s.jpg|thumb|Girton College, Cambridge, early in the 20th century]]
In the autumn of 1913, at the age of 19, Joseph began studying [[Classics]] at [[Girton College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name= Gibbs27&gt;Gibbs 2000, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, under Cambridge University regulations that were not fully repealed until 1948, women were ineligible to receive degrees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Chambers|first= Suzanna|title= At last, a degree of honour for 900 Cambridge women|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/at-last-a-degree-of-honour-for-900-cambridge-women-1157056.html|newspaper= The Independent|date= 31 May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they could sit the degree examinations, in Joseph's case the [[Classical Tripos]].  She soon found much in the university's life to divert her from her regular studies: debating, drama and, above all, music. In her first term she became a double-bass player in the [[Cambridge University Musical Society]] orchestra, under its conductor [[Cyril Rootham]]. She also sang [[alto]] in the society's choir, and may have participated in a performance of [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s ''[[La damnation de Faust]]'' that was praised in the ''Cambridge Review'' of 17 June 1914.&lt;ref name= Gibbs27/&gt; During vacations she continued her composition studies under Holst; in 1916 her "Wassail Song", a companion piece to "The Carrion Crow", was published. At Girton she wrote incidental music for a performance of [[W. B. Yeats]]'s verse play ''[[The Countess Cathleen]]'', in which she acted the part of the First Dragon.&lt;ref name= G28/&gt;

From 1915 Joseph's association with Holst became closer.  Overextended by his teaching duties and other commitments, Holst required assistance in the task of organising his music for publication and performance, and used a group of young women volunteers—his "scribes"—to make fair copies of his scores, write out instrumental or vocal parts, or prepare piano arrangements. In 1915 the composer was working on his largest and best-known work, the orchestral suite ''[[The Planets]]'', and invited Joseph, in her vacations, to join his scribes.&lt;ref name= G28/&gt; Among these were Vally Lasker, a piano teacher from SPGS, and Nora Day, who had been a pupil with Joseph at the school and since 1913 had been teaching there.&lt;ref&gt;Short, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs 2000, pp. 149–50&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph's main assignment for ''The Planets'' was to copy the "Neptune" movement, of which almost the entire original manuscript is written in her hand.&lt;ref name= G28/&gt; For the rest of her career she remained one of Holst's most regular [[amanuenses]],&lt;ref name= Gibbs99/&gt; and he came to rely on her more than on any other. Her commitments to musical activities at Girton, combined with her work for Holst, had an adverse effect on her formal studies. In the 1916 Classical Tripos examinations she was awarded only a Class III pass, a disappointing result duly noted in her parting testimonial from the college.&lt;ref name= G29&gt;Gibbs 2000, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early career====
When Joseph left Girton, the [[First World War]] was at a critical state; the [[Battle of the Somme]] had begun on 1 July 1916. Joseph wanted to assist the war effort, and after considering work on the land or in a munitions factory, took up part-time welfare work in [[Islington]]. In the autumn of 1916 she began teaching at [[Caterham School|Eothen]], a small private school for girls in [[Caterham]], founded and run by the Misses Catharine and Winifred Pye.&lt;ref name= G29/&gt; In 1917 Holst's ten-year-old daughter [[Imogen Holst|Imogen]] started at the school; soon, under Joseph's guidance the young pupil was composing her own music.&lt;ref name= IH9&gt;Grogan (ed.), pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt;  Joseph extended her own musical activities by joining the orchestra at [[Morley College]], where Holst was the director of music and where her brother Edwin had played the cello before the war.&lt;ref name= G31&gt;Gibbs 2000, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; At first she played the double-bass, but later took [[French horn]] lessons, possibly from [[Adolf Borsdorf|Adolph Borsdorf]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Borsdorf, Adolph|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t237/e1401?q=Adolph+Borsdorf&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit|work= The Oxford Dictionary of Music|edition=online|accessdate= 1 May 2013}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; later still, at very short notice, she taught herself the [[timpani]] part for a summer concert.&lt;ref name= G31/&gt; By 1918 she was a member of the Morley committee that on 9 March organised and produced an opera burlesque, ''English Opera as She is Wrote'', in which English, Italian, German, French and Russian opera styles were parodied in successive scenes. The performance was a great success and was repeated at several venues. It may have inspired Holst to use parody in his own opera, ''[[The Perfect Fool]]'', which he began composing in 1918.&lt;ref name= G34&gt;Gibbs 2000, pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;  In her spare time Joseph founded and ran a choir for Kensington [[Nanny|nannies]], which took part in local singing contests as the "Linden Singers".&lt;ref name= G29/&gt;
[[File:Thaxted Windmill and Church - geograph.org.uk - 158193.jpg|thumb|left|Thaxted, Essex, scene of the Whitsun music festivals 1916–18]]
Joseph increased her teaching commitments by often deputising for Holst, both at James Allen's and at SPGS.&lt;ref name= G29/&gt; She also continued in her role of the composer's amanuensis, and was invited to attend the private premiere of ''The Planets'', on 29 September 1918 at the [[Queen's Hall]], where [[Adrian Boult]] conducted the Queen's Hall orchestra. She later wrote: "From the moment of Mars&amp;nbsp;... to the last sound of Neptune, it was a big thing that will last all our lives, I think".&lt;ref name= G36&gt;Gibbs 2000, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; She was able to draw on her classical education at Girton when she helped to translate the  [[Apocryphal gospels|apocryphal]] work ''[[Acts of John|The Acts of John]]'' from the original Greek, to provide the text for Holst's ''Hymn of Jesus'' (1917);&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; for the same work she prepared a vocal score and an arrangement for piano, strings and organ.&lt;ref name= G29/&gt; She and Holst combined to produce a women's voices version (two sopranos and an alto) of [[William Byrd]]'s ''Mass for Three Voices'',&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs 2000, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; and Joseph worked alone to produce an orchestral accompaniment for [[Samuel Wesley]]'s ''Sing Aloud with Gladness''. This latter work was prepared for the 1917 [[Whitsun]] musical festival, one of an annual series of such festivals that Holst masterminded, first at his home town of  [[Thaxted]], in later years at assorted venues including [[Dulwich]], [[Chichester]] and [[Canterbury]]. Joseph became a key figure in these festivals, as organiser, performer and composer. At Thaxted in 1918 two of her compositions were performed: ''Hymn'' for female voices (now lost), and an orchestral piece, ''Barbara Noel's Morris'', which Joseph wrote to mark her friendship with the daughter of [[Conrad Noel]], Thaxted's vicar.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs 2000, pp. 32–33 and p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The years 1917 and 1918 also brought personal sadness. On 22 October 1917 Joseph's father died from a heart attack. On 27 May the following year, just after the Whitsun festival, her brother William was killed in action on the [[Western Front (World War I)|western front]]; in September, Edwin was severely wounded in the final Allied offensive of the war. In his monograph on Joseph's life and music, the composer Alan Gibbs writes that "there is no hint in Jane's letters of the effect these events had on her".&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs 2000, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;  Gibbs quotes [[Duff Cooper]], who wrote of those times: "...&amp;nbsp;if we wept—as weep we did—we wept in secret".&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs 2000, p. 34, quoting Cooper,  p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teacher, facilitator and composer, 1918–1928===

====Postwar years====
[[File:Vaughan-Williams-by-Rothenstein.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.7|Ralph Vaughan Williams, an appreciative critic of Joseph's early compositions]]
In 1919, seeking to consolidate her musical career, Joseph joined the [[Society of Women Musicians]] (SWM), founded in 1911 by the violinist and musicologist [[Marion Scott (musicologist)|Marion Scott]] and others to promote the interests of women in music.&lt;ref name= G40&gt;Gibbs 2000, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Scott was known to Joseph, having been [[Concertmaster|leader]] of the Morley orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Scott, Marion|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/25254?q=Marion+Scott&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit|publisher= Grove Music Online|accessdate= 4 May 2013}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph became a member of the SWM's Composers' Sectional Committee, and occasionally gave lectures to the society on subjects such as "The Necessity of Practical Experience for Composers", and "The Composer as Pupil".&lt;ref name= G40/&gt; In the summer of 1919 she took conducting lessons from [[Adrian Boult]], whom she described as "the most chinless man I have ever met".&lt;ref name= G38&gt;Gibbs 2000, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the lessons was to enable her to conduct   her orchestral work ''Bergamask'', which was performed at the [[London Coliseum|Coliseum Theatre]] under a scheme devised by [[Sir Oswald Stoll]] to showcase new British music. In that same summer she met [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], a close friend of Holst. She played him some of her music, probably a piano reduction of ''Bergamask'', and described him as "a very appreciative critic".&lt;ref name= G38/&gt;

Towards the end of 1918 Holst had asked Joseph to provide a libretto for his opera ''The Perfect Fool'', feeling that she might possess the required light touch that he thought his own writing lacked. It is not clear whether she declined, or whether Holst changed his mind, but he eventually wrote the text himself.&lt;ref&gt;Short, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph did, however, write the story for a ballet based on Holst's music ''The Sneezing Charm''; the ballet, entitled ''A Magic Hour'', was performed at Morley in October 1920.&lt;ref name= G36/&gt; Meantime, Joseph's works were being performed at SWM concerts: two songs, probably from her ''Mirage'' cycle, in January 1920, and some of her settings of [[Walter de la Mare]] poems in December.&lt;ref name= G40/&gt;

At Eothen, Joseph continued to supervise Imogen Holst's musical education, aspects of which had earlier been causing Holst some concern. In a letter to his wife dated February 1919, written when he was serving as [[YMCA]] musical organiser for British troops stationed in the Eastern Mediterranean,  Holst reported that "I've had a very kind and wise letter from Jane about Imogen".&lt;ref name= IH9/&gt; Whatever issues had troubled Holst were resolved satisfactorily, and Joseph became Imogen's theory teacher: "Theory with Jane is ''ripping''", the young pupil enthused.&lt;ref&gt;Grogan (ed.), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer term of 1920, with help from Joseph, Imogen devised and composed a "Dance of Nymphs and Shepherds" which was performed at the school on 9 July.&lt;ref&gt;Grogan (ed.), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 1921 Imogen started at SPGS; before becoming a boarder at Bute House (one of the school's residences for pupils), she stayed in the Joseph family home.&lt;ref&gt;Grogan (ed.), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The Whitsun festivals, suspended during Holst's absence, resumed at Dulwich in 1920. Joseph's part in this event is unrecorded, but she made a major contribution to the following year's festivities, which began beside the Thames at [[Isleworth]] and concluded on Whit Monday at SPGS in the gardens of Bute House.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs 2000, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; For the Monday's celebrations Joseph devised a presentation of [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]]'s [[semi-opera]] from 1690, ''[[Dioclesian]]''. Writing of the occasion after Joseph's death, Holst recalled that she had woven Purcell's music and [[Thomas Betterton]]'s text, both long neglected, "into a delightful out-door pageant founded on a fairy story, complete with lost princess, dragon and princely hero".&lt;ref name= MMR/&gt; Not satisfied with planning every aspect of the outdoor performance, Joseph prepared an indoors version of the entertainment, should the weather require this. The production was a great success, and was repeated that summer in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and,  in October 1921, at the [[The Old Vic|Old Vic]] theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Short, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this considerable organisational task, Holst wrote, "Jane gave the minimum of worry to each person concerned by giving herself the maximum of hard work and forethought".&lt;ref name= MMR/&gt;

====Career zenith====
[[File:AllSaints Blackheath.jpg|thumb|upright|left|All Saints, Blackheath, venue for the 1922 Whitsun festival (2007 photograph)]]
In November 1921 Joseph organised the Morley forces to perform a large-scale pageant, celebrating the bicentenary of the church of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]]. The text was by [[Laurence Housman]] and the music, directed by Holst, was taken from the Morley repertory.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs 2000, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year Joseph's increasing recognition as a composer was confirmed when her ''Seven Two-Part Songs'' were performed at a SWM concert that included works by [[Ethel Smyth]] and other women composers.&lt;ref name= G41&gt;Gibbs 2000, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Joseph's works, ''A Hymn for Whitsuntide'' and ''A Festival Venite'' &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYrHWmIIvOs Performance by Glasgow University Chapel Choir directed by Katy Lavinia Cooper, February 2018&lt;]&lt;/ref&gt; were introduced during the 1922 Whitsun festival at All Saints' church, [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], with Holst conducting. After the ''Venite'' premiere Joseph wrote appreciatively to Holst: "Do you suppose for one moment that any other conductor takes trouble like that? If you do, you are quite wrong".&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs 2000, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Venite'' was performed on 13 June 1923 at the [[Queen's Hall]], by the Philharmonic Choir under [[Charles Kennedy Scott]]; the ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]{{'}}''s critic thought it a "very notable addition to modern British music".&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Hann in ''The Spectator'', 30 June 1922, quoted in Gibbs 2000, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst her compositional and other activities, Joseph found time, in 1922, to organise the first Kensington Musical Competition Festival,&lt;ref name= GMO&gt;{{cite web|title= Joseph, Jane M.|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/52756?q=Jane+Joseph&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit|publisher= Grove Music Online|accessdate= 5 May 2013}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to orchestrate many of the competition songs. In due course this festival became an important annual event in Kensington; Vaughan Williams was among the adjudicators.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs 2000, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 October 1922, Vaughan Williams's 50th birthday, Joseph organised a choir which gave an early-morning surprise performance in the composer's garden of a song she had written to mark the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Short, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1919, Joseph had written to her brother Edwin expressing concern about Holst's health.&lt;ref name= G45&gt;Gibbs 2000, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; When following a physical breakdown in 1923 Holst gave up his duties at Morley College, Joseph wrote him a supportive letter congratulating him on his decision which would enable him to concentrate on composition.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs 2000, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; The following years were particularly fruitful for Holst, and Joseph assisted in many of the works he produced in the 1924–28 period. She helped him prepare the score for his ''Choral Symphony'', for which assistance he presented her with his original draft sketches, as a gesture of gratitude.&lt;ref&gt;Short, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Lasker and Day she worked to prepare vocal and full scores for the opera ''[[At the Boar's Head]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Short, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; and attended the rehearsals in March 1925. After the opera's premiere on 3 April she wrote to Holst with mildly critical comments on some of the singers, though with praise for the conductor, the young [[Malcolm Sargent]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs 2000, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; When Holst composed a short choral piece to celebrate the 21st birthday of the Oriana Madrigal Society, Joseph provided words which humorously reflected the conductor Kennedy Scott's working methods; the work was greatly appreciated by the choir.&lt;ref&gt;Short, pp. 235–36&lt;/ref&gt;  In that same year, 1925, she helped to found the Kensington Choral Society.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs 2000, p. 99 and p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;  By this time the Joseph home in Kensington, where Jane lived for her whole life, was becoming a recognised musical gathering-place; a visitor recalled meeting Vaughan Williams, Boult, and the harpist [[Sidonie Goossens]] there, among others.&lt;ref name= G45/&gt;

In 1926 Joseph provided Holst with the libretto for his choral ballet ''The Golden Goose'', based on a story by the [[Brothers Grimm]],&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; and arranged its first performance at the 1926 Whitsun festival, held at the James Allen school.&lt;ref&gt;Short, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= G48&gt;Gibbs 2000, pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph also assisted Holst and the librettist [[Steuart Wilson]] in the production of a second choral ballet, ''The Morning of the Year''—the first work commissioned by the [[BBC]]'s newly formed music department—which was performed at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in March 1927.&lt;ref name= G48/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Short, pp. 249–50&lt;/ref&gt; The Morley College Annual Report of 1927 recorded the formation of a folk dance club, and noted Joseph's "skilful direction" of the group. Her increasing interest in dance led her, that year, to join the English Folk Dance Society and the Kensington Dance Club.&lt;ref name= G36/&gt;

===Illness, death and tributes===
The main feature of the 1928 Whitsun festival, held at [[Canterbury]], was a religious drama, ''The Coming of Christ'', commissioned by [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]], then [[Dean of Canterbury]], and written by [[John Masefield]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs 2000, pp. 103–07&lt;/ref&gt; Holst provided the incidental music.  In a photograph described by Gibbs, taken of the festival's organisers and performers, Joseph is sitting between Holst and Mrs Bell, "taller than either, an efficient-looking lady in her early thirties, clearly of some importance to the festival".&lt;ref name= Gibbs99/&gt; This was Joseph's last Whitsun. Towards the end of the year her health began to fail; there is a mention in Holst's diary for 29 November 1928, "Jane's concert 8.15", but no indication is given of whether she was a performer. In February 1929 she paid off the final amount owing to the piano manufacturer [[C. Bechstein Pianofortefabrik|C. Bechstein]], for Morley's new piano for which she had been fundraising since 1926. On 9 March 1929 Joseph died at home, in Kensington, of kidney failure. After a private funeral she was buried in [[Willesden Jewish Cemetery]].&lt;ref name= G50&gt;Gibbs 2000, pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

Holst was in Venice when the news of Joseph's death reached him;  although Imogen records that he received it stoically, he was privately devastated.&lt;ref&gt;Grogan (ed.), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph had, wrote Imogen, "come nearest to his ideal of clear thinking and clear feeling".&lt;ref&gt;Holst, I., p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; In his own tribute, Holst drew attention to Joseph's "infinite capacity for taking pains which amounts to genius".&lt;ref name= MMR/&gt; No Whitsun festival was held in 1929, but in early July, at an open-air production of Holst's ''The Golden Goose'' at [[Warwick Castle]], a special performance of his ''St Paul's Suite'' was played in Joseph's memory.&lt;ref&gt;Grogan (ed.), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December 1929, at a competitive music festival, Vaughan Williams conducted the choir in Joseph's ''Hymn for Whitsuntide'' while the audience stood in tribute.&lt;ref name= G50/&gt; The same hymn was played at the first resumed Whitsun festival, at [[Chichester]] in May 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs 2000, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1931 Holst included her music in a concert that he conducted at [[Chichester Cathedral]], alongside works by [[William Byrd]], [[Thomas Weelkes]] and Vaughan Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Short, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the next few years Joseph's works were played at concerts and events organised by Morley College, the SWM, SPGS and the English Folk Dance Society.&lt;ref name= G50/&gt;  At Eothen a "Jane Joseph Memorial Prize" was established, and music scholarships were endowed in her name at Eothen and SPGS.&lt;ref name= G50/&gt;

A friend who expressed personal sadness on hearing of Joseph's death revealed another aspect of her character: "England won't be the same without Jane. She was terribly difficult to get to know at all, and awfully lonely, I thought, in spite of all her friends—don't you think so?—but I can't imagine Music without her".&lt;ref name= G53/&gt;

==Music==
{{Further|List of compositions by Jane Joseph}}
Much of Joseph's music was written for performances at modest-scale events by amateur performers. As such it was never published, and over the years many works have been lost.&lt;ref name= Scowcroft&gt;{{cite web|last= Scowcroft|first= Philip|url= http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2002/Oct02/distaff.htm#ixzz2SRaxNEcS|title= The Distaff Side: some British women composers|publisher= MusicWeb International|date= March 1994|accessdate= 9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The published works and the few others that survive,   Gibbs believes, place Joseph in the category of "progressive" English composers.&lt;ref name= G53&gt;Gibbs 2000, pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;  Although her first few compositions were mainly songs, she demonstrated early abilities as an orchestral composer. Gibbs finds in her two short pieces, ''Morris Dance'' (1917) (originally ''Barbara Noel's Morris'') and ''Bergamask'' (1919), three and five minutes respectively, a "fine feeling for orchestral sound". The ''Morris Dance'' has added sparkle from a [[glockenspiel]], while ''Bergamask'' has a festive Italianate feel.&lt;ref name= Gibbs99/&gt; The music writer Philip Scowcroft praises Joseph's confident handling of the sizeable orchestral forces required for the ''Morris Dance'', while the composer [[Havergal Brian]], Holst's contemporary, found ''Bergamask'' "exhilarating" and "full of promise".&lt;ref name= Scowcroft/&gt; Gibbs suggests that these two works presage Holst's late choral ballets, and comments:  "That these carefree pieces did not find a permanent place in the repertory is unfortunate".&lt;ref name= Gibbs99/&gt;
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=  Miss Joseph's 'Venite' is written in a great tradition&amp;nbsp;... however much the 'Venite' owes in spirit to the Tudor composers, it is an individual and self-supporting growth from that great tree, and its roots draw energy and life from fresh, unvitiated ground." |salign = left |source=  From ''The Spectator'' review of the Queen's Hall performance of Joseph's ''Venite'', June 1923&lt;ref name= MMR/&gt; }}
In Joseph's  ''Mirage''  song cycle of 1921 (five songs with string quartet accompaniment), a Holstian influence is evident alongside her own distinctive compositional voice. Gibbs highlights the first in the cycle, "Song", which initially echoes "To Varuna" from Holst's ''Rig Veda'' hymns, but evolves into "a different creation, distinguished by its own uncluttered quartet writing in which the viola has a special part to play". The final song, "Echo", has as much in common with [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] as with Holst.&lt;ref name= G53/&gt; Joseph's ''Festival Venite'' from 1922 is an example of her use of the [[Dorian mode#Modern Dorian mode|Modern Dorian mode]] (an ascending scale from D to the next D on the white piano keys), which became a feature of some of her later works. Scowcroft and Gibbs both point to Tudor influences in the ''Venite'' in which also, says Gibbs, "the congenial influence of Vaughan Williams in melody and harmony is felt".&lt;ref name= G55&gt;Gibbs 2000, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The orchestral score for this work lost, but an organ accompaniment has been devised. Joseph's unaccompanied choral ''Hymn for Whitsuntide''  also uses the Dorian Mode in what Holst described as a "flawless little motet"; this was first work of Joseph's to be broadcast, in 1968.&lt;ref name= Scowcroft/&gt;&lt;ref name= G55/&gt; A ''Short String Quartet'' in A minor was performed by the Winifred Smith Quartet in December 1922 and was accepted for publication by J.B. Cramer and Co. However, it was not published, and subsequently disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs 2000, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph's carol "A Little Childe There is Ibore", is a setting of a 15th-century poem for three female voices and piano or strings. Holst considered this "the best of Jane's many carols, and perhaps the hardest to perform well."&lt;ref name= MMR/&gt; Written in alternate bars of five and seven beats, it was praised by Brian for its originality.&lt;ref name= Scowcroft/&gt; It was eventually broadcast by the BBC on 21 December 1995.&lt;ref name= G55/&gt; Brian was also an admirer of Joseph's many instructional piano pieces: "pleasingly simple and unaffected".&lt;ref name= Scowcroft/&gt;  These were published between 1920 and 1925; Gibbs writes that these pieces "focus on technical aspects in tuneful and often modal contexts", with occasional excursions into other forms such as [[chaconne]] and [[Rondo#Rondo form|rondo]].&lt;ref name= Gibbs99/&gt;

'''Jesse Merwin''' (1785 – 1865), called the 'pattern' or 'original' of [[Ichabod Crane]] was a rural Schoolmaster in [[Upstate New York]], and a friend of [[Martin Van Buren]] and [[Washington Irving]]. He taught school at a [[single-room schoolhouse]] in [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]], New York.

==Biography==
Jesse Merwin, a 19th-century schoolmaster in [[Kinderhook, New York]],  was described in a well-known longhand script letter by President [[Martin Van Buren]], as the "pattern" for author [[Washington Irving]]'s character of [[Ichabod Crane]] in his story, [[Legend of Sleepy Hollow|The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]].&lt;ref name=STW&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Stanley T.|title=The Life of Washington Irving (Vol.1))|date=1935|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=429|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Yankee Visits Sleepy Hollow”, Yankee Magazine July 1953 p. 32, 33, 40, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a notation by Irving and a certification written in long hand by Martin Van Buren—who was friends with both the author and the schoolteacher—the 'pattern' (Van Buren's words) for the character of Ichabod Crane was based on the original [[Kinderhook (town), New York|Kinderhook]] schoolmaster named Jesse Merwin, whom Irving became friends with in [[Kinderhook, New York]], in 1809.&lt;ref name=denis&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denis|first1=Gary|title=Sleepy Hollow: Birth of the Legend|date=2015|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=978-1-5116-4546-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two friends continued a pen-pal correspondence for thirty years. The [[Columbia County Historical Society]] (New York) owns the original Kinderhook Schoolhouse named after the Irving character based on Jesse Merwin, the town's first schoolteacher.&lt;ref&gt;“Original of Washington Irving’s Characters”, Four-Track News, July 1906, p. 429, vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kinderhook town school district ([[Ichabod Crane Central School District]]) is also named for the Irving character.  Because a member of the [[Van Alen House|Van Tassel family]] was a lieutenant alongside another man in Tarrytown, Samuel Youngs, according to an 1894 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', "it [was] claimed by many in that town (Tarrytown) that [[Samuel Youngs]] was the original from whom Irving drew his character of Ichabod Crane".&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|title=In Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Monument in Memory of Soldiers of the Revolution|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9804E4D91131E033A25757C1A9669D94659ED7CF|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|location=New York|page=17|date=1894-10-14|accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Gary Denis asserts that while the character of Ichabod Crane is loosely based on Kinderhook Schoolmaster, Jesse Merwin, it ''may possibly'' ''include elements'' from Samuel Youngs' life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denis|first1=Gary|title=Sleepy Hollow: Birth of the Legend|date=2015|isbn=978-1-5116-4546-1|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early Irving biographer best known for his interpretation of [[Herman Melville]] as well as his  two-volume biography on Irving, Professor of English at [[Yale University]], [[Stanley Thomas Williams]], also refers to [[Martin Van Buren]]'s certificate, to quote here his two-volume work on Irving: "...Ichabod Crane, Irving drew from the schoolmaster whom he knew in 1809."&lt;ref name=STW/&gt;

==Early years==
By 1809 Merwin was teaching at a District School in [[Kinderhook (town), New York|Kinderhook]], where he boarded at the home of [[William Peter Van Ness|Judge William Peter Van Ness]]. There he met another boarder, a twenty-six year old tutor and aspiring author named [[Washington Irving]]. Irving and Merwin went fishing and hunting together during that period and became lifelong friends.

==Personal life==
Merwin married Jane Van Dyke, the daughter of a wealthy Kinderhook farmer in 1808, and  together they had eight sons and three daughters, including in 1834, Merwin named one of his sons 'Washington Irving Merwin' after his friend the author.
Merwin died in Kinderhook on November 8, 1852.

{{refimprove|date=April 2015}}
A '''letterman''', in [[United States|U.S.]] activities/sports, is a [[high school]] or [[college]] student who has met a specified level of participation or performance on a [[varsity team]].

==Overview==
[[File:Letterman jacket.jpg|thumb|right|A wool baseball jacket with embroidered letter "W" and award medals.]]
The term comes from the practice of awarding each such participant a cloth "[[Varsity letter|letter]]", which is usually the school's initial or initials, for placement on a "letter sweater" or "letter jacket" intended for the display of such an award.  In some instances, the sweater or jacket itself may also be awarded, especially for the initial award to a given individual.

Today, in order to distinguish "lettermen" from other team participants, schools often establish a minimum level of participation in a team's events or a minimum level of performance in order for a letter to be awarded.

A common threshold in [[American football]] and [[basketball]] is participation in a set level, often half, of all quarters in a season.

In individual sports such as [[tennis]] and [[golf]], the threshold for lettering is generally participation in one half or sometimes two-thirds of all matches contested.  Frequently, other members of the team who fail to meet requirements for a letter are awarded a certificate of participation or other award considered to be of lesser value than a letter.

Some schools continue to base the awarding of letters according to performance, in team sports requiring a certain number of scores, steals, baskets or tackles, according to position and sport. In individual sports letters are often determined according to qualification for state meets or tournaments. Other schools award letters on a more subjective basis, with the head coach, usually with the input of other coaches and sometimes  student team leaders who have already lettered, awarding letters for substantial improvement as well as significant performance on or off the field. This places much more emphasis on character, commitment and teamwork as well as, and often in place of, simply playing enough or meeting some other time or performance requirement. Sometimes in high schools academic performance in classes can also be an element. This philosophy gives more focus to developing and rewarding a well rounded and balanced player, where other methods focus strictly on athletic performance and on the field victories.

This term is not gender-specific; a qualifying participant in women's basketball or other women's sports is properly referred to as a letterman, as would be a qualifying female participant on a co-educational sports team.

An athlete who is awarded a letter (or letters in multiple sports) is said to have "lettered" when they receive their letter.

In recent years, some schools have expanded the concept of letterman beyond sports, providing letters for performance in [[performing arts]], [[academics]], or other school activities.

==Letter jacket==

A '''letter jacket''' is a [[Flight_jacket#The_Letterman_Jacket|baseball-styled jacket]] traditionally worn by high school and college students in the United States to represent school and team pride as well as to display personal awards earned in athletics, academics or activities. Letter jackets are also known as "varsity jackets" and "baseball jackets" in reference to their American origins.

===Appearance and style===
The body (i.e., torso) is usually of [[boiled wool]] and the sleeves of leather with banded wrists and waistband. Letter jackets are usually produced in the school colors with the body of the jacket in the school's primary color and sleeves in the secondary color.  Although sometimes, the colors of the jacket may be customized to a certain extent by the student.  There could be cases where a student could change the color so much that it doesn't differentiate too much from school colors. 
They usually feature a banded collar for men or a hood for women.

===Decorations===
The letter jacket derives its name from the [[varsity letter]] [[Chenille fabric|chenille]] patch on its left breast, which is almost always the first letter or initials of the high school or college the jacket came from. The letter itself can also be custom fitted to the particular sport or activity (ex. Cross Country- a symbol or sign in the middle of the letter).

The name of the owner usually appears either in chenille (matching the letter) or is embroidered on the jacket itself. The owner's graduation year typically appears in matching chenille. Placement of the name and year of graduation depends on school traditions. The year is most often sewn on the right sleeve or just above the right pocket. The school logo and symbols representing the student's activities may also be ironed  on to the jacket.

Lettermen who play on a championship team often receive a large patch commemorating their championship that is worn on the back of the jacket.

Lettermen who participate in a sport in which medals are awarded often sew the medals onto their jackets to display their accomplishments.

===History===
Varsity jackets trace their origins to '''letter [[sweater]]s''', first introduced by the [[Harvard Crimson baseball|Harvard University baseball]] team in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallagher|first=Jake|title=Dropping Knowledge: The Varsity Jacket|url=https://www.gq.com/style/blogs/the-gq-eye/2012/09/dropping-knowledge-the-varsity-jacket.html|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The letter was usually quite large and centered (if the sweater was a pullover); stripes on one sleeve designated the number of letters won, with a star indicating a team captain.

===Traditions===
Letter jackets are almost never purchased before a student has earned a letter. In schools where only [[varsity letters]] are awarded this is usually the practice in a student's junior or senior year. Recently, however, many student athletes have been awarded letters during their sophomore and sometimes freshman year, leading to the need for a jacket much sooner. Still, the actual jacket isn't usually purchased until the sophomore year at least. In schools where junior varsity letters are awarded, the jacket may be purchased by junior varsity letter recipients, though the letter is placed just above the left pocket, leaving space for a future varsity letter.

Some schools may award letter jackets to letter winners at the award ceremony, but more often the school only provides the letter. Some schools will have fund raising activities or other programs to provide jackets to students who cannot afford them.

While it is commonly done, removing one's letter from the letter jacket upon graduation is not firmly held as protocol.  Many graduates keep the letter on the jacket after graduation as a symbol of accomplishment and school pride and commitment, especially with college lettermen.

==Biography==
Mabel was born to Harold and Mary Cratty in [[Bellaire, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="NYT obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Y.W.C.A. Leader, Mabel Cratty, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0630.html|work=New York Times|date=February 28, 1928|accessdate=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mabel had a brother, Donald, and a sister, Anna. Her uncle was the Methodist bishop [[James Mills Thoburn]].&lt;ref name="NYT obit" /&gt;

She attended public school and received her teacher's education at [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] (OWU). After graduating from OWU in 1890, Mabel became a public school teacher. From 1900 to 1904, she was the principal of a high school in [[Delaware, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="NYT obit" /&gt; She received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from OWU in 1922.

Mabel left Delaware, Ohio in 1904 to take a position with the YWCA in [[Chicago]]. She became the Secretary of the Board in 1906 and served in other capacities for the YWCA as well. In addition to this and other work with the YWCA, Mabel Cratty was involved with a variety of other organizations, including [[World Student Christian Federation]] (WSCF), and the National Committee on the Cause and Cure of War (CCCW).

The Women's Building on the campus of [[George Williams College]] (GWC), built in 1926, was renamed Mabel Cratty Hall in her honor in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.gwcconferences.com/about/our-history.html|work=GWC Conference Center website|accessdate=October 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her papers from 1904 to 1928 are a part of the Sophia Smith Collection of  [[Smith College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mabel Cratty Papers, 1904-1928 (Bulk: 1913-1928)|url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss296.html|work=Five College Archives and Manuscript Collections|publisher=Sophia Smith Collection|accessdate=October 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the time of her death, she lived in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="NYT obit" /&gt;

'''''Maestra''''' is a 33-minute documentary film directed by [[Catherine Murphy (filmmaker)|Catherine Murphy]], about the youngest women teachers of the 1961 [[Cuban Literacy Campaign]].

In 1961, Cuba aimed to eradicate illiteracy in one year. It sent 250,000 volunteers across the island to teach reading and writing in rural communities for one year. 100,000 of the volunteers were under 18 and more than half of them were women.

In 2004, Murphy discovered that she knew several women in Havana who had volunteered for the project; they were in their 60s. Murphy was due to return to the United States, but before doing so, she decided to record three interviews with former Literacy Campaign volunteers. From 2004 to 2010, Murphy continued to track down stories of Literacy Campaign volunteers and the families that hosted them, eventually producing and directing ''Maestra'' and founding [[The Literacy Project]].&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;[http://vanderbilt.edu/clas/curriculum-resources/resource.php?id=44 ''Maestra Vanderbilt Curriculum Guide''], Center for Latin American Studies, Vanderbilt University&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is narrated in English by Pulitzer Prize–winning author [[Alice Walker]] and features Spanish-language interviews (with English subtitles) with nine of the women who taught in the Campaign.&lt;ref name=WMM&gt;[http://www.wmm.com/filmcatalog/pages/c863.shtml ''MAESTRA'']|Women Make Movies&lt;/ref&gt; ''Maestra'' features interviews with Norma Guillard, one of the first Cuban women to call herself a feminist, and Diana Balboa, one of the first open members of Cuba's LGBT community and an international advocate for gay and lesbian rights.

===President of the University of Minnesota (1997–2002)===
On July 1, 1997, Yudof took office as the 14th president of the [[University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref name="UC bio"/&gt; In his first year as president, Yudof took advantage of a state budget surplus to fund construction projects, historic preservation, and academic priorities at the university.

The university encountered [[University of Minnesota basketball scandal|scandal]] in 1999 after the ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]'' reported that an academic counseling staffer at Minnesota claimed to have done coursework for many student-athletes on the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball]] program over the past five years, as well as several other [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] rules violations by Minnesota basketball.&lt;ref name="accused of academic fraud"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Dohrmann  | first = George  | title = U basketball program accused of academic fraud  | work = [[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]  | date = March 10, 1999  | url = http://www.pioneerplanet.com/uofm/docs/0310gophers.htm | accessdate = May 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011230153823/http://www.pioneerplanet.com/uofm/docs/0310gophers.htm|archivedate=December 30, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yudof oversaw self-imposed sanctions on the men's basketball program.

In 2002, a six-story apartment-style hall was built at the University of Minnesota and was named after Mark G. Yudof. It is referred to as Yudof or Yudof Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://umn.irisregistration.com/Home/Site?code=parentsorientation|title=Landing Page - Iris.Conference|website=umn.irisregistration.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===President of the University of California (2008–2013)===
In March 2008, Yudof was selected as the next president of UC, to succeed [[Robert C. Dynes]].&lt;ref name=uc-2008-03-20&gt;{{cite press release | title=Search committee recommends Mark Yudof be appointed next UC president | publisher=University of California | date=2008-03-20 | url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/17517 | accessdate=2008-04-01 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327174048/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/17517 | archivedate=2008-03-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his term on June 16, 2008.

In November 2009, ''[[TIME Magazine]]'' recognized Mark Yudof as one of the "10 Best College Presidents", citing his efforts to provide opportunity and access to a quality education for California residents with financial need whose family income is less than $60,000.&lt;ref name="Time 2009"&gt;{{cite web|author=Yan, Sophia|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1937938_1937933_1937940,00.html|title=The 10 Best College Presidents: Mark Yudof|work=Time|date=November 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Yudof announced his plan to resign as president of the University of California, effective August 31, 2013.&lt;ref name=uc-2013-01-18&gt;{{cite press release|title=President Yudof to end his tenure in August |publisher=University of California |date=2013-01-18 |url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/28955 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121015909/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/28955 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-21 |accessdate=2013-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== California budget crisis ====

The [[California budget crisis]] resulted in massive cuts to higher education by the California State Legislature and Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].&lt;ref name="California's crisis hits its prized universities"/&gt; Struggling to grapple with the ensuing crisis, California legislative leaders cut more than 20 percent from the UC budget in one year - the largest budgetary reduction in the history of the UC. In a July 9 [https://web.archive.org/web/20130901191548/http://www.ucop.edu/president/biography/index.html "Open Letter to UC alumni and friends,"] UC Regent Richard Blum; [[Russell Gould]], then-chair; Sherry Lansing, then-vice chair; and UC president Yudof wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;
"The UC model — providing universal access to a top-notch, low-cost education and research of the highest caliber — continues to be studied around the globe among those who would emulate its success. And yet, this model has been increasingly abandoned at home by a state government responsible for its core funding."&lt;ref name="California's crisis hits its prized universities"&gt;{{Cite news|title=California's crisis hits its prized universities|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1911455,00.html|first=Kevin|last=O'Leary|date=18 July 2009|accessdate=2010-03-22|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As state budgetary support declined dramatically, Yudof kicked off an [http://www.ucforcalifornia.org/uc4ca/home/ online grassroots advocacy effort] in order to make the case for the University of California. In 2008, Yudof became the first president of a major research university to organize advocacy efforts using [http://www.ucforcalifornia.org/uc4ca/home/ email], [http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/budget/ blogs], [https://twitter.com/mark_yudof Twitter], [https://www.facebook.com/ucforcalifornia?v=app_2373072738&amp;ref=ts#/group.php?gid=6756592601&amp;ref=ts Facebook], and other social media components. Yudof called on all students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends to unite behind an aggressive push to make funding UC a state priority.

In 2009, Yudof further bolstered this effort through a campaign seeking to let legislators and the governor know how critical their support is in preserving the university's commitment to quality and student access.&lt;ref&gt;UC Newsroom http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/22360{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2009, Yudof came under criticism for an interview that he gave to Deborah Solomon of the [[New York Times]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/magazine/27fob-q4-t.html Big Man on Campus], in which he joked about taking a pay cut from his salary of over $800,000 to $400,000 in exchange for the White House and Air Force One.

====Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan ====

In February 2009,&lt;ref&gt;UC Announces Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/19471/{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; upon President Yudof's recommendation, the [[University of California Board of Regents]] unanimously approved a new [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]] plan intended to support college access for lower-income families and students. Under the policy, known as the [http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/blueandgold/ ''Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan''], undergraduates who are in their first four years of attendance at UC—or two for transfer students—will receive enough scholarship and grant assistance to at least fully cover their systemwide UC fees if they have incomes below $80,000 and meet other basic eligibility requirements for need-based financial aid.

==== Project You Can ====

In October 2009, seeking to help keep the University of California accessible and affordable for California students, President Yudof announced an ambitious effort that aims to raise $1 billion for student support over the next four years. Through the fundraising effort, [http://youcan.universityofcalifornia.edu/ ''Project You Can''], all 10 UC campuses have committed to raise $1 billion in the aggregate over the next four years—doubling the amount of private support the system has raised for scholarships, fellowships and other gift aid in the previous five years.&lt;ref&gt;UC Newsroom announcement http://youcan.universityofcalifornia.edu/scholarships.html&lt;/ref&gt; The UC Board of Regents endorsed the effort at its November 2009 meeting. Yudof made the [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/10/uc-announces-new-fundraising-campaign.html Project You Can announcement] at Sunnyside High School, which for 10 years has propelled promising students toward health careers through its Doctors Academy, a program sponsored by UCSF Fresno. Despite facing social and economic barriers — 87 percent of Sunnyside's students are eligible for free or reduced lunch — all Doctors Academy graduates have gone on to college, 43 percent of them at UC campuses.

Citing increasingly unreliable funding provided to universities by state government, President Yudof called for the [[federal government]] to bolster its financial commitments to the nation’s universities and colleges in his paper titled [https://web.archive.org/web/20130901191548/http://www.ucop.edu/president/biography/index.html ''Exploring a New Role for Federal Government in Higher Education'']. In announcing the proposal, Yudof remarked:
&lt;ref&gt;UC Budget blog, http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/budget/?p=950{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We must find creative ways to expand the federal commitment to research and access into a new category: The nuts-and-bolts core funding that is vital to a robust university, allowing it to hire quality professors, equip laboratories and expand the physical plant.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[New York Times]] columnist [[Bob Herbert]] visited the [[UC Berkeley]] campus and had this to say: &lt;blockquote&gt;
The problems at Berkeley are particularly acute because of the state’s drastic reduction of support. But colleges and universities across the country — public and private — are struggling because of the prolonged economic crisis and the pressure on state budgets. It will say a great deal about what kind of nation we’ve become if we let these most valuable assets slip into a period of decline.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;  His op-ed piece, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/03/opinion/03herbert.html?_r=3&amp;amp;ref=opinion "Cracks in the Future,"] ran in the [[New York Times]] citing [[UC Berkeley]] as evidence of the cracks appearing in America’s cornerstone of civilization - higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Herbert, The New York Times https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/03/opinion/03herbert.html?_r=3&amp;amp;ref=opinion&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
Yudof is a [[fellow]] of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and a member of the [[American Law Institute]]. In 1993, he and his wife, Judy, were the co-recipients of the [[Jewish National Fund]] Tree of Life Award.  Judy Yudof served as the first female international president of the [[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=jewish-woman&gt;{{cite news|title=Judy Yudof is First Woman to Head Conservative Movement |date=Summer 2002 |work=Jewish Woman |publisher=Jewish Women International |url=http://www.jwmag.org/site/c.fhLOK0PGLsF/b.2440551/ |accessdate=2008-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214023740/http://www.jwmag.org/site/c.fhLOK0PGLsF/b.2440551/ |archivedate=February 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2010, Regents of the University of Texas System established the Mark G. and Judy G.

Dr. '''Mary S. Sutherland, EdD, MPH, FAAHB''' was professor of [[health education]] at [[Florida State University]], where she held appointments in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction and the Department of Human Services and Studies. She coauthored more than 50 papers in peer-reviewed journals. 

Sutherland earned her bachelor of science degree in health and physical education from Michigan State University in 1962, an MS degree in physical education from the [[University of Tennessee]] in 1964, and an EdD in health, physical education and recreation from the [[University of Alabama]] at Tuscaloosa in 1973. 

She later returned to the University of Tennessee for an MPH degree in community health and health planning in 1978. Upon completion of her EdD she joined the faculty of the Department of Health Science at the [[State University of New York at Brockport]], where she served as coordinator of the school health education program from 1974-1977. 

From 1978-80, Sutherland served as associate professor chairperson in the Department of Health Education at the University of Maine at Farmington. She also played a key role during this period in the operations of the newly created Maine Health Education Resource Center and became one of the architects of the plan for a school health education program for the State of Maine. 

In 1980, she moved to Florida State University, where she remained until her death. Dr Sutherland was the recipient in 1982 of the Joseph Y. Porter Award, the most prestigious recognition given to an individual by the Florida Public Health Association. In 1998, she became a Fellow of the American Academy of Health Behavior. That same year, she was honored by the American School Health Association for outstanding achievement in prevention research. She has twice (in 1992 and 1995) received a Secretary's Excellence Award for Health Promotion from the [[US Department of Health and Human Services]]. Several of her funded programs have been recognized officially by local and regional organizations for excellence in three different decades.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11883">'''Maturation''' is a guiding notion in [[Philosophy of education|educational theory]] that argues children will develop their cognitive skills innately, with little influence from their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Child Development|last=Salkind|first=Neil J.|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Environmentalism,''' closely related to [[behaviorism]], is the opposite view, that children acquire cognitive skills and behaviors from their surroundings and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning and Memory|last=Byrne|first=John H.|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|year=2004|isbn=|location=New York|pages=57–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have studied the development of infants through various topics and have found support for both maturation and environmentalism. Two of the most commonly studied topics are: i) infant crawling and ii) infant language learning. Psychologists have found evidence supporting both the maturation theory and environmentalism theory when investigating each of these topics.

== Infant crawling ==
[[File:Ten_m3-Regulates-Eye-Specific-Patterning-in-the-Mammalian-Visual-Pathway-and-Is-Required-for-pbio.0050241.sv001.ogv|thumb|This video clip shows a visual cliff made for rats. The checkered material is the shallow area. The area not containing the checkered material is the deep area. Rats crossing this boundary experience the illusion of a drop in height.]]
One of the most common apparatus used by psychologists to study infant crawling is the [[visual cliff]]. This cliff was first used with different types of animals as well as infants to measure depth perception''.'' &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walk|first=Richard D.|last2=Gibson|first2=Eleanor J.|title=A comparative and analytical study of visual depth perception.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0093827|journal=Psychological Monographs: General and Applied|language=en|volume=75|issue=15|pages=1–44|doi=10.1037/h0093827}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Organisms are placed on a raised glass board. Under the glass, material is placed to give the effect of a floor on one side of the apparatus. On the other side, the material is taken away to give the effect of a drop, and a deep side''.'' &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When infants are placed on this apparatus, psychologists can study whether or not these infants, or other animals, have gained the skills needed to understand that the visual drop is dangerous, or if they still cross the drop point.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If young infants can avoid the experimental drop while crawling, researchers can assume that the aversion to cliffs is innately learned, not learned through crawling experience or teaching.

=== Arguments for maturation ===
In one study, it was found that the age an infant begins crawling, and not the crawling experience of an infant, determined whether they would cross or avoid the visual cliff. The infants with a later crawling start date avoided the cliff significantly more than infants with an earlier crawling start date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richards|first=John|last2=Radar|first2=Nancy|date=|title=Crawling-Onset Age Predicts Visual Cliff Avoidance in Infants|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|volume=7|pages=382-287|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These observations indicate that there is a biological time clock that is intuitively teaching infants about depth avoidance, rather than crawling experience teaching them about avoidance. These conclusions are consistent with maturation theory. In another study, psychologists found that the crawling experience negatively affected infants who could not yet walk and were placed in walkers on the virtual cliff. In this study too, the age when crawling began was a better indicator of whether the infant would avoid the cliff rather than his or her crawling experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rader|first=Nancy|last2=Bansano|first2=Mary|last3=Richards|first3=John E.|date=|title=On the Nature of the Visual-Cliff-Avoidance Response in Human Infants|url=|journal=Child Development|volume=51|pages=61–68|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lends evidence to the theory of maturation and innate age related steps in development, rather than external factors.

=== Arguments for environmentalism ===
Studies using a real water visual cliff found that infants with greater crawling experience had an easier time avoiding the cliff than those with less experience. A water cliff is a visual cliff with water in the deep end of the apparatus, and can measure an infant's potential perception of danger, as well as sensitivity to water''.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burnay|first=Carolina|last2=Cordovil|first2=Rita|date=2016-09-01|title=Crawling Experience Predicts Avoidance of Real Cliffs and Water Cliffs: Insights from a New Paradigm|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/infa.12134/abstract|journal=Infancy|language=en|volume=21|issue=5|pages=677–684|doi=10.1111/infa.12134|issn=1532-7078}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results indicating that crawling experience was a greater indicator of avoidance align with the environmentalism theory in that infants learn through experiences with their environment. Additionally, researchers have also observed that infants who have learnt avoidance through crawling carried this avoidance over to when they start walking, rather than having to relearn these skills. '''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witherington|first=David C.|last2=Campos|first2=Joseph J.|last3=Anderson|first3=David I.|last4=Lejeune|first4=Laure|last5=Seah|first5=Eileen|date=2005-05-01|title=Avoidance of Heights on the Visual Cliff in Newly Walking Infants|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1207/s15327078in0703_4/abstract|journal=Infancy|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=285–298|doi=10.1207/s15327078in0703_4|issn=1532-7078}}&lt;/ref&gt;''' These carryover effects indicate that infants are learning and processing through interactions with their environment and can apply their learnings to other new situations.

=== Mixed results ===
It has also been observed that a mother's emotions, seen through facial expression, can sometimes regulate an infant's behavior. Infants were placed on a visual cliff with a clear drop, and were able to see their mothers' facial expressions. When the mothers expressed fear, fewer infants crossed the cliff, indicating that the mothers' expressions had an effect on their behavior, supporting the environmentalism theory. However, when infants were placed on a visual cliff with a hidden drop, many infants crossed regardless of their mothers' facial expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sorce|first=James F.|last2=Emde|first2=Robert N.|last3=Campos|first3=Joseph J.|last4=Klinnert|first4=Mary D.|title=Maternal emotional signaling: Its effect on the visual cliff behavior of 1-year-olds.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.21.1.195|journal=Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=195–200|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.21.1.195}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lends credence to the maturation theory; infants innately understand crawling and do not take cues from their surroundings.

== Language learning ==
While specific alphabets, grammar, and sounds might differ in different regions of the world, language is a universal form of communication within all societies, with all infants learning how to speak early in their lives. However, there has been much debate on how children acquire their language skills. More specifically, psychologists have argued about whether the skills of learning a language are innate within all humans, consistent with the maturation theory, or are learned through societal teaching practices, consistent with the theory of environmentalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gleitman|first=Lila|date=|title=Maturational determinants of language growth|url=|journal=Cognition|volume=10|pages=102–114|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCartney|first=Kathleen|date=|title=Effect of Quality of Day Care Environment on Children's Language Development|url=|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=20|pages=244–260|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arguments for maturation ===
Infants are usually thought to be quick language learners, as people believe that children have implicit abilities to learn languages, whereas adults learning a language must use explicit instruction to obtain proficiency. However, it was found that if given explicit instructions, both children and adults learn new languages effectively. This finding endorse the reasoning that children have inherent abilities to learn languages that are not influenced by the environment. However, these inherent abilities to learn languages can be developed into even stronger skills with help from the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lichtman|first=Karen|date=2016|title=Age and learning environment: Are children implicit second language learners?*|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-child-language/article/age-and-learning-environment-are-children-implicit-second-language-learners/457C069A5339D656788E7E8D217B2A3A|journal=Journal of Child Language|language=en|volume=43|issue=3|pages=707–730|doi=10.1017/S0305000915000598|issn=0305-0009|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arguments for environmentalism ===
One way to examine the potential effect of the environment on the language abilities of children is to study the effects of day care environments on language learning skills. If young children spend a significant portion of their formative years in day care, and if the environment influences their ability to learn language, then there should be a correlation between the quality of day care and language abilities. Psychologists studying this relationship found that the quality of day cares, as well as the language skills of the day care providers are large predictors of children's' language ability. Children in higher quality day care locations had much stronger language abilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This evidence strongly supports the environmental theory that argues factors in a child's environment affect their development and language abilities. Additionally, the longer an infant or child experiences better care during their formative years, the stronger its language skills will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Weilin|last2=Farkas|first2=George|last3=Duncan|first3=Greg|last4=Burchinal|first4=Margaret|last5=Vandell|first5=Deborah Lowe|date=|title=Timing of High-Quality Child Care and Cognitive, Language, and Preacademic Development|url=|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=49|pages=1440–1451|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parent's responsiveness to children can also help facilitate language and vocabulary growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tamis-LeMonda|first=Catherine S.|last2=Kuchirko|first2=Yana|last3=Song|first3=Lulu|date=|title=Why is infant language learning facilitated by parental responsiveness?|url=|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=23|pages=121–126|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Environmentalism and behavioral interventions ====
In children with language development problems and behavioral disorders, parent behavioral interventions and speech therapy interventions have also been shown to significantly improve language development in young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tempel|first=Ashley B.|last2=Wagner|first2=Stephanie M.|last3=McNeil|first3=Cheryl B.|title=Parent-child interaction therapy and language facilitation: The role of parent-training on language development.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0100241|journal=The Journal of Speech and Language Pathology – Applied Behavior Analysis|language=en|volume=3|issue=2-3|pages=216–232|doi=10.1037/h0100241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parental influence can change and dictate young children language skills, an improvement that would not be seen from just internal maturation factors alone.

[[File:McEvedyShield.jpg|thumb|225px|The McEvedy Shield.]]
The '''McEvedy Shield''' is an annual [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] competition held in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]], for four of the region's boys' [[secondary school]]s. 
It was first held in 1922 and has become one of the highlights of the sporting calendar for the schools involved. The wooden shield, which is presented to the winning school, was donated in by Dr Patrick F. McEvedy to promote the spirit of athletic competition between the participating colleges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominionpost/4866057a25560.html McEvedy Shield: Pride on the line, The Dominion Post, Tuesday, 3 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; An old boy of St Patrick's College, Wellington, Dr McEvedy went on to represent [[England]] in [[rugby union]]. 

The 2018 competition was won by [[Wellington College (New Zealand)|Wellington College]] on Tuesday 6 March at Newtown Park, winning 4 titles in a row, and marking their 52nd McEvedy victory, out of 94 meetings.

== Patrick McEvedy ==

The shield was donated by [[Pat McEvedy|Patrick Francis McEvedy]] (1880-1935)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scrum.com/churchillcup/rugby/player/1664.html http://www.scrum.com/churchillcup/rugby/player/1664.html]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1922.  McEvedy attended St Patrick's, Wellington, from 1895 to 1898, before going to [[Guy's Hospital]] in [[London]] to train as a doctor. He toured New Zealand in 1904 with Bedell-Sivwright's British team and again in 1908 with the Anglo-Welsh team. He later returned to Wellington and was [[Wellington Rugby Football Union]] President 1931-1933 and [[NZRFU]] President 1934-1935.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spcob.org.nz/SITE_Default/news_and_events/newsletter_archive/march02.asp#0-7 http://www.spcob.org.nz/SITE_Default/news_and_events/newsletter_archive/march02.asp#0-7] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523185441/http://www.spcob.org.nz/SITE_Default/news_and_events/newsletter_archive/march02.asp#0-7 |date=23 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
The competition features fourteen track and field events across four age groups - under 14 years, under 15 years, under 16 years, under 17 and over 17
years. For each event in each age group,  four points are awarded for first place, three points for second place, two points for third place and one point for fourth place.

===Track===
[[100 metres]], [[200 metres]], [[400 metres]], [[800 metres]], [[1500 metres]], and [[3000 metres]], 80 metre [[Hurdling|hurdles]], [[100 metre hurdles]], [[110 metre hurdles]] and [[4 x 100 metres relay]].

===Field===
[[High jump]], [[long jump]], [[triple jump]], [[Javelin throw|javelin]], [[discus]] and [[shot put]].

==Participating schools==
[[Wellington College (New Zealand)|Wellington College]] and [[St. Patrick's College, Wellington]] are the only schools that remain from the original competition in 1922, with [[Rongotai College]] first competing in 1928 and [[St. Patrick's College, Silverstream|St Patrick's College, Silverstream]] taking part in the school's first year of existence, 1931.

Over the years there have been a number of schools that have taken part in the competition, including [[Hutt Valley High School]], [[Scots College, Wellington|Scots College]] and [[Wairarapa High School]] (which shared the Shield in 1925 with Wellington College, and won outright in 1927). In the early 1980s it was decided that only the four traditional boys' schools would be able to compete. 

In 2009, Scots College's attempt to rejoin the McEvedy Shield was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/sport/college-sport/2805190/McEvedy-Shield-hijacked-by-big-four McEvedy Shield 'hijacked' by big four. Retrieved 9 July 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venue==

[[File:NewtownPark.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The four colleges on the banks and stands of Newtown Park.]]
The competition is held at [[Newtown Park]], Newtown. Held during school hours, the entire student body of each school assembles to support its team. Because of the large number of spectators, the schools take turns sitting in the main stand. Each year two schools watch from the surrounding grass banks.

It has previously been held at the [[Basin Reserve]], [[Athletic Park (Wellington)|Athletic Park]] and on the St Patrick's College grounds at [[Silverstream]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6169">'''Medical Missions for Children''' is an independent, non-profit organization that works to improve health outcomes for our world's most critically ill children by providing individual [[telemedicine]] consultations and implementing education programs focused on narrowing the knowledge gap between healthcare providers in the United States and those in the developing world.  MMC focuses on "transferring medical knowledge from those who have it to those who need it" using a state-of-the-art communications infrastructure in order to touch the lives of more than one million critically ill children each year.

==About==
Medical Missions for Children was founded in 1999 by Frank and Peg Brady.  Its Global Telemedicine and Teaching Network - GTTN - currently serves over 100 countries throughout Latin America/Caribbean, Africa, North America, Asia/Pacific, Eastern Europe/Central Asia and the Middle East.

MMC is located on the campus of [[St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center]] in [[Paterson, New Jersey]]. It is a major stakeholder in [[List of tallest buildings in Paterson|The Hamiltonian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Hamiltonian |publisher=Garret Mountain Associates |date= |url=http://www.gmanj.com/home.html |accessdate=2014-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121171821/http://www.gmanj.com/home.html |archivedate=2014-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a 14-story hotel and conference center projected to open in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | title = Medical Missions for Children Hilton Doubletree   | publisher = Emporis   | date =    | url = http://www.emporis.com/building/medical-missions-for-children-hilton-doubletree-paterson-nj-usa   | accessdate = 2014-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web      | last = Prochilo   | first = Dan   | title = Developer predicts $150M Paterson hotel will be 'very, very busy'   | publisher = Emporis   | date = August 11, 2014   | url = http://www.fios1news.com/newjersey/node/33976#.VIgKLt77-8U   | accessdate = 2014-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | last = Ma   | first = Myles   | title = $100 million Paterson hotel to break ground in October   | publisher = The Star-Ledger   | date = August 7, 2014   | url = http://www.nj.com/passaic-county/index.ssf/2014/08/100_million_paterson_hotel_to_break_ground_in_october.html   | accessdate = 2014-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Malinconico   | first = Joe   | title = Paterson hotel project at hospital gets $105 million in state funding   | publisher = NorthJersey.com   | date = December 10, 2013   | url = http://www.northjersey.com/news/paterson-hotel-project-at-hospital-gets-105-million-in-state-funding-1.653635   | accessdate = 2014-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Global Telemedicine and Teaching Network==
The Global Telemedicine and Teaching Network (GTTN) comprises several programs:
*The Medical Broadcasting Channel - A 24/7/365 channel airing medical programming via satellite broadcast, [[Internet2]], and IPTV Networks.
*The Telemedicine Outreach Program -  a network of 27 tier-one mentoring hospitals in the United States and Europe linking to hospitals and institutions in more than 100 countries.

This Medical Missions for Children/Paterson, NJ (MMC) should not be confused with Medical Missions for Children (MMFC), a 501(3)(c) charity based in Woburn, MA that sends 13-15 surgical, medical and dental missions around the world each year to care for impoverished children who suffer from cleft deformities, microtia (absence of ear), head and neck abnormalities and severe, untreated burn injuries

==Television Programs==
MMC currently produces four healthcare series, several of which have been broadcast on the [[New Jersey Network]], the predecessor to NJTV, New Jersey's affiliate of [[PBS]].
*Tomorrow's Medicine Today
*Plain Talk About Health
*Take Care
*Healthy U

==The ''Giggles'' Children's Theater==
Located at St. Joseph's Children's Hospital, the ''Giggles'' Children's Theater (''Giggles'') draws its curtains twice each week to bring the healing powers of laughter through the performing arts to hospitalized children in Paterson.  Each performance is broadcast live on the hospital's closed-circuit TV system so that no child is excluded due to sickness or incapacity. Each performance is also recorded and rebroadcast so that 10 shows per week are offered on the hospital's Giggles TV channel.

In April 2007 a second ''Giggles'' theater opened at The Children's Inn located at the campus of the [[National Institutes of Health]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2758">'''Michael C. Bird''' is an economics lecturer, and was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the [[Colorado State Senate]] from 1984 to 1994.

Bird graduated from [[Western Maryland College]] in 1961, and gained his [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]]. He joined [[Colorado College]] in 1968, and was a Fulbright Lecturer in [[Mexico]] in 1966 through 1968, and [[Peru]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20060919211633/http://www.coloradocollege.edu/academics/catalog/?page=faculty&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 Bird and fellow [[Colorado College]] Professor Fred Sondermann were elected to city council of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] on a "Sensible Growth" ticket.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20060919193206/http://www.coloradocollege.edu/125/Timeline1960sto1970s.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Bird went on to become a Colorado State senator in 1984.

After a failed bid to become [[Governor of Colorado]] in 1993, losing out to business man [[Bruce D. Benson|Bruce Benson]] in the GOP due to his superior financial resources,&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty1.coloradocollege.edu/~bloevy/BookGovernor1994/GovernorTwentySeven.htm Governor Twenty-Seven&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and being time barred to extend his stay in the Senate in 1994, he returned to the world of education as a lecturer at [[Colorado College]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coloradocollege.edu/library/specialcollections/ColoradoCollege/Catalystindex.html Colorado College Tutt Library: Special Collections&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926214527/http://www.coloradocollege.edu/library/specialcollections/ColoradoCollege/Catalystindex.html |date=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Bird became Professor Emeritus of Economics at Colorado College, a position he still holds.

Bird is married to Ursula Steinhoff-Bird, the daughter of [[World War II]] [[Luftwaffe]] ace and former [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] military commander, [[Johannes Steinhoff]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/magazines/world_war_2/3026146.html TheHistoryNet | World War II | Interview With World War II Luftwaffe Eagle Johannes Steinhoff&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124182238/http://www.historynet.com/magazines/world_war_2/3026146.html |date=2008-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools''' ('''Middle States Association''' or '''MSA''') is a voluntary, peer-based, [[non-profit]] association that performs peer evaluation and regional [[educational accreditation|accreditation]] of public and private schools in the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic United States]] and certain foreign institutions of American origin. The MSA has until at least 2013 comprised three separate commissions: 
* '''Middle States Commission on Higher Education''' ('''MSCHE''')
* '''Middle States Commission on Elementary Schools''' ('''MSCES''')
* '''Middle States Commission on Secondary Schools''' ('''MSCSS''') 
The MSCES and the MSCSS operate together as an organization sometimes known as the '''MSA-CESS'''. The accreditation of post-secondary schools by the MSCSS is limited to those that do not confer degrees, or that offer technical programs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg6.html Regional and National Institutional Accrediting Agencies]. U.S. Department of Education, "College Accreditation in the United States". Retrieved 9 April, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Region and scope==
The "Middle States Commissions on Elementary and Secondary Schools" (M.S.A.-C.E.S.S.) accredits [[State school|public]] and [[private schools]] as well as school systems  throughout the [[United States]] and it states it is active in more than 85 countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msa-cess.org/RelId/606489/ISvars/default/Accreditation.htm MSA-CESS website], retrieved June 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

MSA used to accredit colleges and universities through its higher education commission.  In 2013, that commission — the [[Middle States Commission on Higher Education]] — became a legally separate entity.

'''Music Teachers National Association''' ('''MTNA''') is an American [[nonprofit]] professional organization for the support, growth, and development of music-teaching professionals, with some 22,000 members in 50 states, and over 500 local affiliates. MTNA offers a wide range of member resources, from leadership, teaching and personal health support, to insurance, financial and legal services. It also comprises two subsidiaries, the MTNA Professional Certification Program, and the MTNA Foundation Fund, which supports a variety of programs that include music competitions and commissioning of composers. MTNA was founded in 1876, and is registered as a [[501(c)(3)]] organization in Ohio, with headquarters located in [[Cincinnati]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtna.org/about-mtna/ About MTNA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204115738/http://www.mtna.org/about-mtna/ |date=2013-12-04 }}, [http://www.mtna.org/member-resources/ Member resources] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407165035/http://www.mtna.org/member-resources/ |date=2015-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Music Teachers National Association is an American organization founded in 1876 by [[Theodore Presser]], who was both a musician and publisher. MTNA is credited in helping to establish an international pitch scale in 1883 as well as promoting international copyright law and giving official recognition to the American composer.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich, "A Centennial History of the Music Teachers National Association." 1976, 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, MTNA approved the program for qualified teachers. MTNA is also known for commissioning compositions by American composers and presenting the annual Distinguished Composer of the Year Award. The association also hold annual competitions for young musicians at the local, state, and national level.&lt;ref&gt;Rita H. Mead “Music Teachers National Association.” In Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, 2007-2013 – Accessed September 20, 2013. http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/19451&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the organization had approximately 22,000 members, including teachers, performers, and composers, and more that 500 local affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtna.org/about-mtna/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-11-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204115738/http://www.mtna.org/about-mtna/ |archive-date=2013-12-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official journal of the MTNA, ''American Music Teacher'', was first published in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, “Music Teachers National Association.”&lt;/ref&gt;

MTNA's purpose is to advance the benefit of studying music and music making to society and to support the professionalism of music teachers. MTNA maintains two subsidiary programs: MTNA Professional Certification Program and the MTNA Foundation Fund. The Professional Certification Program exists to improve the quality of professionalism  in applied music teaching and assists the public in identifying proficient music teachers in their communities. The MTNA Foundation Fund supports programs that financially assist teachers and students with  educational objectives while supplying an opportunity for individual and corporate support of MTNA and its programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtna.org/about-mtna/history/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-11-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123030504/http://www.mtna.org/about-mtna/history/ |archive-date=2013-11-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and Special Programs==

As an association of music teachers, MTNA's mission is to elevate the professional level and develop  the standing of all its members. MTNA is responsible for disseminating many publications, including books, journals, and pamphlets that have greatly impacted the profession of teaching music.  MTNA also perpetually seeks newly published music and other teaching materials to raise awareness among its members.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich, "A Centennial History of the Music Teachers National Association," 1976, 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Certification of Teachers ===

According to MTNA, "The National Certification Plan is one of the highest importance to the professional welfare of the music teacher, and it provides a means of measuring and recognizing his or her professional growth. It represents almost a century of consultation and deliberation on the part of America's musical leaders."&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich, "A Centennial History of the Music Teachers National Association." 1976, 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MTNA Forums===

The independent music teachers forum of MTNA was the first established in 1972,  at the MTNA Convention in Portland, Oregon.  After this initial meeting, IMTF organized different committees on the local and state levels.  Its purpose was "To investigate the role of the full time independent teacher in American society today: the problems, advantages, and practices of this group, with the goal of establishing a true profession in this decade."&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich, "A Centennial History of the Music Teachers National Association." 1976, 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple forums now exist through MTNA. They provide an environment for open discussion and the expression of ideas. These forums meet annually at the MTNA conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtna.org/programs/forums/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-11-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022043713/http://www.mtna.org/programs/forums/ |archive-date=2013-10-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These forums include:

==="Distinguished Composer of the Year" Award===

First awarded in 1969, the terms of the Distinguished Composer of the Year Award state that an MTNA-affiliated state music teachers association could commission any composer of their choice to compose a work for their state convention.  Recording and scores of these works could then be sent to the national headquarters in Cincinnati.  From these commissions, one composer is selected each year by a panel of judges to receive the "Distinguished Composer Award," otherwise known as the "Composer of the Year" award.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich, "A Centennial History of the Music Teachers National Association." 1976, 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nancy H. Adsit''' ([[pen name]], '''Probus'''; May 21, 1825 – April 27, 1902) was an American art lecturer, art educator, and writer. A graduate of [[Ingham University]], she contributed for half a century to art literature.{{sfn|Herringshaw|1904|p=26}}

Adsit was the first woman to enter the insurance field in the United States, and, as far as was known, in the world. She was possessed of an unusual combination: great literary ability and excellent business sense. At the age of 13, she assumed charge of her own affairs and her future education. Some of her early writings aroused great antagonism, and her identity was withheld by her editor and not until many years later did she acknowledge their authorship. On the death of her husband, Charles Davenport Adsit, of [[Buffalo, New York]] in 1873, the widow assumed entire charge of his business and general insurance agency. After a most successful career in this line, she sold the business and resumed her writing. She contributed to the [[London]] ''[[The Art Journal|Art Journal]]'', writing an interesting series of articles for them on "The Black and White in Art" or "Etching and Engraving." This brought demands for lectures and parlor talks on art, and she began a course of classes for study. For many years, she delivered these lectures in the principal cities of the U.S. and her name was prominently connected with art education both in the U.S. and abroad.

==Early years and education==
Nancy H. Warren was born in [[Palermo, New York]], May 21, 1825. She was of [[New England]] [[Puritans]] lineage, and was descended from the [[Mayflower]] [[John Robinson (pastor)|Robinsons]] on the mother's side, and from the patriotic Warrens of [[Massachusetts]] on the father's side, her father being a clergyman and missionary. Her early life was a discipline in self-dependence, which aided and stimulated the development of an inherited force of character, enabling her to combat and conquer adverse conditions, overcome obstacles and from childhood mark out for herself and pursue steadily a career that achieved success. At the age of 13, she assumed entire charge of herself and her fortunes. The expenses of collegiate study in Ingham University were met by teaching and journalism.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=9}}

==Career==
Adsit was a regular contributor to the columns of the [[New York City]] ''Baptist Register'', the ''Boston Recorder'', the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' and the ''Western Literary Messenger''. Her earlier work was mostly in the line of poetic effusions and several series of "lay sermons" under the signature of "Probus." These sermons aroused intense antagonism in clerical circles, on account of their latitudinarianism on theologic questions. Heated and prolonged discussions followed each publication. "Probus," the unknown, was adjudged by a general council "guilty of heresy," and the sermons were denounced and condemned. The series was completed, however, and her identity was held between herself and the editor, and not until many years later, by her own voluntary confession, was the writer identified. Meanwhile, the thought of the clergy, as of the world at large, had broadened, and the sermons were no longer under proscription.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=9}}

She married Charles Davenport Adsit, of Buffalo, December 13, 1862. Her home during the next three years was at 11 North Division street, in that city. Alternating literary, charitable and church work with her domestic duties, she developed an ideal home. They removed to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], in 1865, where the husband died in 1873, leaving his widow charged with large responsibilities. Adsit immediately assumed the entire charge and management of a general insurance agency. She was the first woman in general insurance in the U.S., and, so far as is known, in the world. Protests from family friends and jealous antagonisms on the part of business competitors met her at the threshold of the work, but she won public favor as she gave assurance of ability, until the work was crowned with such success as to leave no cause for its further prosecution. Accordingly, Adsit sold the business, with her good will, and resumed writing. Her range of work reached from the political questions of the day to science and art. Her contributions to the London ''Art Journal'' for many years brought a request for a series of articles on the "White and Black in Art," or "Etching and Engraving." Finding no satisfactory data for thorough investigation in books, she visited the studios of artists as well as the workshops of engravers, gathering at firsthand the necessary information, even to the practical use of the tools of each craft. An entire year was consumed in this preparatory work.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=9}}

Months before the articles were completed the demand for parlor conversation on the topics which so absorbed her induced Adsit to open her home to groups of ladies and gentlemen, who cared to take up the study in earnest. The field of her labor gradually broadened, and from 1880, she gave lecture courses in nearly all the principal cities of the U.S.. Her name became prominently identified with art education, both in the U.S. and abroad. While Adsit disclaimed being an artist, she was a competent and thorough critic and elucidator of art. Her criticisms of prints, especially, were sought by connoisseurs and collectors. The secret of her success lay in the fact that her work was simply the expression of her own personality, including an abounding enthusiasm which carried her audiences. In a report of its [[Wisconsin]] secretary to the Association for the Advancement of Women, of which Adsit is one of the vice-presidents,{{sfn|Association for the Advancement of Women|1892|p=5}} the writer said: "To Mrs. C. D. Adsit's work is due, directly or indirectly, most of the art interest in our State as well as the entire West." Her own adverse experiences quickened and enlarged her sympathies toward all working women, to whom she gave not only wholesome advice, but also substantial aid. Her home in Milwaukee was a center of art and of social interchange.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=10}} She died April 27, 1902, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and was buried at [[Forest Home Cemetery]], Milwaukee.

== Editorial practice ==
Levinson focuses on the opportunities presented by digital and online media for reaching new audiences and expanding the impact of scholarly work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Nancy|date=2013-10-01|title=Print and Pixel|url=https://placesjournal.org/article/print-and-pixel/|journal=Places Journal|language=en-US|issue=2013|doi=10.22269/131001|issn=2164-7798}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Under Levinson’s editorship, ''Places'' moved from print to online and built a substantial and wide-ranging interdisciplinary readership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://placesjournal.org/news/from-the-editor-2009/|title=From the Editor|work=Places Journal|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://landscapearchitecturemagazine.org/2014/10/22/places-journal-has-a-new-place/|title=PLACES JOURNAL HAS A NEW PLACE|date=2014-10-22|work=Landscape Architecture Magazine|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levinson has expanded the mandate of the journal under the tagline “Public scholarship on architecture, landscape, and urbanism”''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://placesjournal.org/|title=Places Journal|work=Places Journal|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her editorial direction is described as “harnessing the moral and investigative power of public scholarship to promote equitable cities and sustainable landscapes.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Levinson has led funding campaigns to support the research and publication on topics that might not otherwise be addressed. This has resulted in funding from the [[Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts|Graham Foundation]] for three initiatives – History of the Present: Cities in Transition,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Future Archive&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grahamfoundation.org/grantees/5232-future-archive|title=Graham Foundation &gt; Grantees &gt; Places Journal|website=www.grahamfoundation.org|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Writers’ Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grahamfoundation.org/grantees/5526-places-journal-writers-fund|title=Graham Foundation &gt; Grantees &gt; Places Journal|website=www.grahamfoundation.org|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inequality Chronicles, a series investigating racial, social and economic inequality in American cities, was funded by [[The Kresge Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://placesjournal.org/series/the-inequality-chronicles/|title=The Inequality Chronicles: A Series on Places Journal|work=Places Journal|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levinson has also used ''Places'' as a foundation on which to build a range of related enterprises that seek to expand participation, readership and the dissemination of scholarship on the built environment.

[[File:Newtons cradle animation book 2.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|The cradle in [[Motion (physics)|motion]]]]
'''Newton’s cradle''' is a device that demonstrates [[conservation of momentum]] and [[conservation of energy|energy]] using a series of swinging spheres. When one sphere at the end is lifted and released, it strikes the stationary spheres, transmitting a force through the stationary spheres that pushes the last sphere upward. The last sphere swings back and strikes the still nearly stationary spheres, repeating the effect in the opposite direction. The device is named after 17th-century English scientist Sir [[Isaac Newton]]. It is also known as '''Newton's balls''' or '''Executive Ball Clicker'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencedemonstrations.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k16940&amp;tabgroupid=icb.tabgroup19784/NewtonsCradle/NewtonsCradle.html |title=Sciencedemonstrations.fas.harvard.eu |publisher=Sciencedemonstrations.fas.harvard.edu |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hendrix2.uoregon.edu/~demo/Demo/Mechanics/ILM/Balls.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720095258/http://hendrix2.uoregon.edu/~demo/Demo/Mechanics/ILM/Balls.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 July 2011 |title=Hendrix2.uoregon.edu |publisher=Hendrix2.uoregon.edu |accessdate=3 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://claymore.engineer.gvsu.edu/~flanderb/files/Newton.htm |title=claymore.engineer.gvsu.edu |publisher=claymore.engineer.gvsu.edu |accessdate=3 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928170526/http://claymore.engineer.gvsu.edu/~flanderb/files/Newton.htm |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://demo.pa.msu.edu/showdemo.asp?DID=DID26 |title=Demo.pa.mus.edu |publisher=Demo.pa.msu.edu |accessdate=3 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814121658/http://demo.pa.msu.edu/showdemo.asp?DID=DID26 |archivedate=14 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Newton’s Cradle 1 Jan 18.jpg|thumb|A 5-ball newton's cradle]]
A typical Newton's cradle consists of a series of identically sized metal balls suspended in a metal frame so that they are just touching each other at rest. Each ball is attached to the frame by two wires of equal length angled away from each other. This restricts the [[pendulum]]s' movements to the same plane.

==Operation==
[[File:Newton’s cradle slo mo.webm|thumb|Newton's cradle in [[slow motion]].]]
When one of the end balls ("the first") is pulled sideways, the attached string makes it follow an upward arc. When it is let go, it strikes the second ball and comes to nearly a dead stop. The ball on the opposite side acquires most of the velocity of the first ball and swings in an arc almost as high as the release height of the first ball.  This shows that the last ball receives most of the energy and momentum of the first ball. The impact produces a compression wave that propagates through the intermediate balls. Any efficiently elastic material such as steel does this, as long as the kinetic energy is temporarily stored as potential energy in the compression of the material rather than being lost as heat. There are slight movements in all the balls after the initial strike but the last ball receives most of the initial energy from the drop of the first ball. When two (or three) balls are dropped, the two (or three) balls on the opposite side swing out. Some say that this behavior demonstrates the conservation of momentum and kinetic energy in elastic collisions. However, if the colliding balls behave as described above with the same mass possessing the same velocity before and after the collisions, then any function of mass and velocity is conserved in such an event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gauld|first1=Colin F.|title=Newton’s Cradle in Physics Education|journal=Science &amp; Education|date=August 2006|volume=15|issue=6|pages=597–617|doi=10.1007/s11191-005-4785-3|bibcode=2006Sc&amp;Ed..15..597G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics explanation==
[[File:Newton's Cradle 2 ball cropped.gif|thumb|Newton's cradle with two balls of equal weight and perfectly efficient elasticity. The left ball is pulled away and let go. Neglecting the energy losses, the left ball strikes the right ball, transferring all the velocity to the right ball. Because they are the same weight, the same velocity indicates all the momentum and energy are also transferred. The kinetic energy, as determined by the velocity, is converted to potential energy as it reaches the same height as the initial ball and the cycle repeats.]]
[[File:Newtons cradle 5 ball system cropped.gif|thumb|An idealized Newton's cradle with five balls when there are no energy losses and there is always a small separation between the balls, except for when a pair is colliding.]]
[[File:Newtons cradle 3 ball swing 5 ball system cropped.gif|thumb|Newton's cradle three-ball swing in a five-ball system. The central ball swings without any apparent interruption.]]
Newton's cradle can be modeled with simple physics and minor errors if you incorrectly assume the balls always collide in pairs. If one ball strikes four stationary balls that are already touching, the simplification can't explain the resulting movements in all five balls, which are not due to friction losses. For example, in a real Newton's cradle the fourth has some movement and the first ball has a slight reverse movement. All the animations in this article show idealized action (simple solution) that only occurs if the balls are '''not''' touching initially and only collide in pairs.

===Simple solution===
The conservation of momentum (mass&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;velocity) and kinetic energy (0.5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;mass&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;velocity^2) can be used to find the resulting velocities for [[elastic collision|two colliding perfectly elastic objects]].  These two equations are used to determine the resulting velocities of the two objects. For the case of two balls constrained to a straight path by the strings in the cradle, the velocities are a single number instead of a 3D vector for 3D space, so the math requires only two equations to solve for two unknowns.  When the two objects weigh the same, the solution is simple: the moving object stops relative to the stationary one and the stationary one picks up all the other's initial velocity. This assumes perfectly elastic objects, so we do not need to account for heat and sound energy losses.

Steel does not compress much, but its elasticity is very efficient, so it does not cause much [[waste heat]]. The simple effect from two same-weight efficiently elastic colliding objects constrained to a straight path is the basis of the interesting effect seen in the cradle, and gives an approximate solution to all its action.

For a sequence of same-weight elastic objects constrained to a straight path, the effect continues to each successive object. For example, when two balls are dropped to strike three stationary balls in a cradle, there is an unnoticed but crucial small distance between the two dropped balls, and the action is as follows: The first moving ball that strikes the first stationary ball (the second ball striking the third ball) transfers all its velocity to the third ball and stops. The third ball then transfers the velocity to the fourth ball and stops, and then the fourth to the fifth ball. Right behind this sequence is the first ball transferring its velocity to the second ball that just stopped, and the sequence repeats immediately and imperceptibly behind the first sequence, ejecting the fourth ball right behind the fifth ball with the same small separation that was between the two initial striking balls.  If they are simply touching when they strike the third ball, precision requires the more complete solution below.

====Other examples of this effect====
The interesting effect of the last ball ejecting with a velocity nearly equal to the first ball can be seen in sliding a coin on a table into a line of identical coins, as long as the striking coin and its twin targets are in a straight line.  The effect can similarly be seen in billiard balls. The effect can also be seen when a sharp and strong pressure wave strikes a dense homogeneous material immersed in a less-dense medium.  If the identical atoms, molecules, or larger-scale sub-volumes of the dense homogeneous material are at least partially elastically connected to each other by electrostatic forces, they can act like a sequence of colliding identical elastic balls. The surrounding atoms, molecules, or sub-volumes experiencing the pressure wave act to constrain each other similarly to how the string constrains the cradle's balls to a straight line. For example, [[lithotripsy]] shock waves can be sent through the skin and tissue without harm to burst [[Kidney stone disease|kidney stones]]. The side of the stones opposite to the incoming pressure wave bursts, not the side receiving the initial strike.

====When the simple solution applies====
For the simple solution to precisely predict the action, no pair in the midst of colliding may touch a third ball, because the presence of the third ball effectively makes the struck ball appear heavier. Applying the two conservation equations to solve the final velocities of three or more balls in a single collision results in many possible solutions, so these two principles are not enough to determine resulting action.

Even when there is a small initial separation, a third ball may become involved in the collision if the initial separation is not large enough. When this occurs, the complete solution method described below must be used.

Small steel balls work well because they remain efficiently elastic with little heat loss under strong strikes and do not compress much (up to about 30&amp;nbsp;µm in a small Newton's cradle). The small, stiff compressions mean they occur rapidly, less than 200 microseconds, so steel balls are more likely to complete a collision before touching a nearby third ball. Softer elastic balls require a larger separation to maximize the effect from pair-wise collisions.

===More complete solution===
[[File:Newton Cradle 5 ball system in 3D 2 ball swing.gif|thumb|Newton's cradle five-ball system in 3D two-ball swing]]
A cradle that best follows the simple solution needs to have an initial separation between the balls that is at least twice the distance that the surface of balls compresses, but most do not. This section describes the action when the initial separation is not enough and in subsequent collisions that involve more than 2 balls even when there is an initial separation. This solution simplifies to the simple solution when only 2 balls touch during a collision. It applies to all perfectly elastic identical balls that have no energy losses due to friction and can be approximated by materials such as steel, glass, plastic, and rubber.

For two balls colliding, only the two equations for conservation of momentum and energy are needed to solve the two unknown resulting velocities. For three or more simultaneously colliding elastic balls, the relative compressibilities of the colliding surfaces are the additional variables that determine the outcome. For example, five balls have four colliding points and scaling (dividing) three of them by the fourth gives the three extra variables needed to solve for all five post-collision velocities.

Newtonian, Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, and stationary action are the different ways of mathematically expressing classical mechanics. They describe the same physics, but must be solved by different methods. All enforce the conservation of energy and momentum. Newton's law has been used in research papers. It is applied to each ball and the sum of forces is made equal to zero. So there are five equations, one for each ball—and five unknowns, one for each velocity. If the balls are identical, the absolute compressibility of the surfaces becomes irrelevant, because it can be divided out of both sides of all five equations, producing zero.

Most materials like steel that are efficiently elastic approximately follow Hooke's force law for springs, &lt;math&gt;F=k\cdot x&lt;/math&gt;, but because the area of contact for a sphere increases as the force increases, colliding elastic balls follow Hertz's adjustment to Hooke's law, &lt;math&gt;\ F=k\cdot x^{1.5}&lt;/math&gt;. This and Newton's law for motion (&lt;math&gt;F=m\cdot a&lt;/math&gt;) are applied to each ball, giving five simple but interdependent differential equations that are solved numerically. When the fifth ball begins accelerating, it is receiving momentum and energy from the third and fourth balls through the spring action of their compressed surfaces. For identical elastic balls of any type with initially touching balls the action is the same for the first strike, except the time to complete a collision increases in softer materials. 40% to 50% of the kinetic energy of the initial ball from a single-ball strike is stored in the ball surfaces as potential energy for most of the collision process. 13% of the initial velocity is imparted to the fourth ball (which can be seen as a 3.3 degree movement if the fifth ball moves out 25 degrees) and there is a slight reverse velocity in the first three balls, the first ball having the largest at −7% of the initial velocity. This separates the balls, but they come back together just before as the fifth ball returns. This is due to the pendulum phenomenon of different small angle disturbances having approximately the same time to return to the center. When balls are "touching" in subsequent collisions is complex, but still determinable by this method, especially if friction losses is included and the pendulum timing is calculated exactly instead of relying on the small angle approximation.

The differential equations with the initial separations are needed if there is less than 10&amp;nbsp;µm separation (less than width of a human hair) when using 100 gram steel balls with an initial 1&amp;nbsp;m/s strike speed.

The Hertzian differential equations predict that if two balls strike three, the fifth and fourth balls will leave with velocities of 1.14 and 0.80 times the initial velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/hinch/publications/PRSLA455_3201.pdf |title=The fragmentation of a line of balls by an impact |first1=E.J. |last1=Hinch |first2=S. |last2=Saint-Jean |journal=Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A |year=1999 |volume=455 |pages=3201–3220}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is 2.03 times more kinetic energy in the fifth ball than the fourth ball, which means the fifth ball would swing twice as high in the vertically direction as the fourth ball.  But in a real Newton's cradle the fourth ball swings out as far as the fifth ball. To explain the difference between theory and experiment, the two striking balls must have at least ≈10&amp;nbsp;µm separation (given steel, 100&amp;nbsp;g, and 1&amp;nbsp;m/s). This shows that in the common case of steel balls, unnoticed separations can be important and must be included in the Hertzian differential equations, or the simple solution gives a more accurate result.

===Effect of pressure waves===
The forces in the Hertzian solution above were assumed to propagate in the balls immediately, which is not the case. Sudden changes in the force between the atoms of a material builds up to form a pressure wave.  Pressure waves (aka sound) in steel travel about 5&amp;nbsp;cm in 10 microseconds, which is about 10 times faster than the time between the first ball striking and the last ball being ejected. The pressure waves reflect back and forth through all 5 balls about 10 times, although dispersing to less of a wave front with more reflections.  This is fast enough for the Hertzian solution to not require a substantial modification to adjust for the delay in force propagation through the balls. In less-rigid but still very elastic balls such as rubber, the propagation speed is slower, but the duration of collisions is longer, so the Hertzian solution still applies. The error introduced by the limited speed of the force propagation biases the Hertzian solution towards the simple solution because the collisions are not affected as much by the inertia of the balls that are further away.

Identically-shaped balls help the pressure waves converge on the contact point of the last ball: at the initial strike point one pressure wave goes forward to the other balls while another goes backwards to reflect off the opposite side of the first ball, and then it follows the first wave, being exactly 1 ball-diameter behind. The two waves meet up at the last contact point because the first wave reflects off the opposite side of the last ball and it meets up at the last contact point with the second wave. Then they reverberate back and forth like this about 10 times until the first ball stops connecting with the second ball. Then the reverberations reflect off the contact point between the second and third balls, but still converge at the last contact point, until the last ball is ejected—but it's less of a wave front with each reflection.

===Effect of different types of balls===
Using different types of material does not change the action as long as the material is efficiently elastic.  The size of the spheres doesn't change the results unless the increased weight exceeds the elastic limit of the material. If the solid balls are too large, is be lost as heat, because the elastic limit increases as radius&lt;sup&gt;1.5&lt;/sup&gt; but the energy had to be absorbed and released increases as radius&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  Making the contact surfaces flatter can overcome this to an extent by distributing the compression to a larger amount of material but it can introduce an alignment problem. Steel is better than most materials because it allows the simple solution to apply more often in collisions after the first strike, its elastic range for storing energy remains good despite the higher energy caused by its weight, and the higher weight decreases the effect of air resistance.

===Heat and friction losses===
This discussion has neglected energy losses from heat generated in the balls from non-perfect elasticity, friction in the strings, friction from air resistance, and sound generated from the clank of the vibrating balls. The energy losses are the reason the balls eventually come to a stop, but they are not the primary or initial cause of the action to become more disorderly, away from the ideal action of only one ball moving at any instant. The increase in the non-ideal action is caused by collisions that involve more than two balls at a time, effectively making the struck ball appear heavier. The size of the steel balls is limited because the collisions may exceed the elastic limit of the steel, deforming it and causing heat losses.

==Applications==
The most common application is that of a desktop [[executive toy]]. Another use is as an educational physics demonstration, as an example of [[conservation of momentum]] and [[conservation of energy]].

A similar principle, the propagation of waves in solids, was used in the Constantinesco [[Synchronization gear]] system for propeller / gun synchronizers on early fighter aircraft.{{elucidate|date=May 2015}}

==History==
[[File:American Science and Surplus - Newton's Cradle.jpg|thumb|right|Large Newton's cradle at American Science and Surplus]]
[[Christiaan Huygens]] used pendulums to study collisions. His work, ''De Motu Corporum ex Percussione'' (On the Motion of Bodies by Collision) published posthumously in 1703, contains a version of [[Newton's first law]] and discusses the collision of suspended bodies including two bodies of equal mass with the motion of the moving body being transferred to the one at rest.

The principle demonstrated by the device, the law of impacts between bodies, was first demonstrated by the French [[physicist]] [[Edme Mariotte|Abbé Mariotte]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~scidemos/NewtonianMechanics/NewtonsCradle/NewtonsCradle.html|title= Harvard website page on Newton's Cradle|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Edme Mariotte]]&lt;/ref&gt; Newton acknowledged Mariotte's work, among that of others, in his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''.

There is much confusion over the origins of the modern Newton's cradle. Marius J. Morin has been credited as being the first to name and make this popular [[executive toy]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} However, in early 1967, an English actor, [[Simon Prebble]], coined the name "Newton's cradle" (now used generically) for the wooden version manufactured by his company, Scientific Demonstrations Ltd.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} After some initial resistance from retailers, they were first sold by [[Harrods]] of London, thus creating the start of an enduring market for executive toys.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Later a very successful chrome design for the Carnaby Street store Gear was created by the sculptor and future film director [[Richard Loncraine]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The largest cradle device in the world was designed by ''[[MythBusters]]'' and consisted of five one-ton concrete and steel [[rebar]]-filled buoys suspended from a steel truss.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb episode|2074856|Newton's Crane Cradle (5 October 2011)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buoys also had a steel plate inserted in between their two halves to act as a "contact point" for transferring the energy; this cradle device did not function well because concrete is not elastic so most of the energy was lost to a heat buildup in the concrete. A smaller scale version constructed by them consists of five {{Convert|6|inch|cm|adj=mid}} chrome steel ball bearings, each weighing {{convert|33|lb|kg}}, and is nearly as efficient as a desktop model.

The cradle device with the largest diameter collision balls on public display was visible for more than a year in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], Wisconsin, at the retail store American Science and Surplus (see photo). Each ball was an inflatable exercise ball {{convert|26|in|cm}} in diameter (encased in steel rings), and was supported from the ceiling using extremely strong magnets. It was dismantled in early August 2010 due to maintenance concerns.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==In popular culture==
Newton's cradle has been used more than 20 times in movies,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/search/keyword?keywords=newton%27s-cradle Most Popular "Newton's Cradle" Titles - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; often as a [[Trope (literature)|trope]] on the desk of a lead villain such as Paul Newman's role in ''The Hudsucker Proxy'', Magneto in ''X-Men'', and the Kryptonians in ''Superman II''.  It was used to represent the unyielding position of the NFL towards head injuries in ''Concussion''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cinemaniacreviews.net/2015/12/31/review-concussion/ Concussion – Cinemaniac Reviews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211075312/https://cinemaniacreviews.net/2015/12/31/review-concussion/ |date=11 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used as a relaxing diversion on the desk of lead intelligent/anxious/sensitive characters such as Henry Winkler's role in ''Night Shift'', Dustin Hoffman's role in ''Straw Dogs'', and Gwyneth Paltrow's role in ''Iron Man 2''. It was featured more prominently as a series of clay pots in ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', and as a row of 1968 [[Eero Aarnio]] bubble chairs with scantily-clad women in them in ''Gamer''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stylessentials.com/?p=385 13 Icons of Modern Design in Movies « Style Essentials&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Storks (film)|Storks]]'', Hunter the CEO of Cornerstore has one not with balls, but with little birds.

In 2017, an episode of the ''Omnibus'' [[podcast]], featuring ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' champion [[Ken Jennings]] and musician [[John Roderick (musician)|John Roderick]], focused on the history of Newton's Cradle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.omnibusproject.com/podcasts/newtons-cradle-entry-835-1c1311.htm  ''Omnibus'': Newton's Cradle (Entry 835.1C1311)]&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's cradle is also featured on the desk of Deputy White House Communications Director [[Sam Seaborn]] in ''[[The West Wing]]''.

Jefferson Airplane (1968) on the album "Crown of Creation" used the cradle as a rhythm device to create polyrhythms on an instrumental track.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13046">A '''polytechnic''' ({{Lang-cy|coleg polytechnig}}&lt;ref&gt;http://m.cy.caimeiprinter.com/info/polytechnic-museum-of-printing-621616.html&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[tertiary education]] teaching institution in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] offering higher diplomas, undergraduate degree and post graduate education (masters and PhDs) that was governed and administered at the national level by the [[Council for National Academic Awards]]. At the outset the focus of Polytechnics was on [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] subjects with a special emphasis on [[engineering]].  After the passage of the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]] they became independent [[university|universities]] which meant they could award their own degrees. The comparable institutions in [[Scotland]] were collectively referred to as [[Central Institution]]s. Like polytechnics or technological universities ([[institute of technology]]) in other countries, their aim was to teach both purely academic and professional vocational degrees (engineering, computer science, law, architecture, management, business, accounting, journalism, town planning) etc. Their original focus was applied education for professional work and their original roots concentrated on advanced engineering and applied science ([[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] subjects), though soon after being founded they also created departments concerned with the humanities. The polytechnic legacy was to advance and excel in undergraduate and post graduate degrees in engineering and technology (STEM) education that now form a core faculty at most universities in the UK. While many former polytechnics have advanced their research focus many have stayed true to their original ethos by focusing on teaching for professional practice.

The division between universities and polytechnics was known as the [[Binary Divide]] in UK higher education.

==History==

=== 19th century ===
Some polytechnics trace their history back to the early 19th century. The [[University of Westminster|London Polytechnic]] (now the [[University of Westminster]]) emerged from the Royal Polytechnic Institution which was founded at Regent Street, London in 1838. The establishment of the polytechnic was a reaction to the rise of industrial power and technical education in France, Germany and the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Brosan, "The Development of Polytechnics in the UK", ''Paedagogica Europaea'', Vol 7, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Degrees at the London Polytechnic were validated by the University of London. The first British institution to use the name "polytechnic" was the [[Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society]], which it still retains, together with the affectionate nickname "The Poly".

=== 1960s–1992 ===
Most polytechnics were formed in the expansion of higher education in the 1960s, [[Academic degree]]s in polytechnics were validated by the UK [[Council for National Academic Awards]] (CNAA) from 1965 to 1992. The CNAA was chartered by the British government to validate and award degrees and maintain national quality assurance standards. The CNAA subject boards from their inception were from the universities. A CNAA degree was formally recognised as equivalent to a university degree and the courses were under strict scrutiny by assessors external to the polytechnics.&lt;ref name="DAvis1979"&gt;{{cite paper|title=The council for national academic awards 1964-74: a study of a validating agency|author=Davis, Martin C.|date=1979|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/7924/3/Thesis-1979-Davis.pdf|publisher=Loughborough University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sub-degree courses at these institutions were validated by the Business &amp; Technology Education Council ([[Business and Technology Education Council|BTEC]]).

Some polytechnics were often seen as ranking below universities in the provision of higher education because they lacked degree-awarding powers, concentrated on applied science and engineering education and produced less research than the universities, and because the qualifications necessary to gain a place in one were sometimes lower than for a university (the failure rate in the first year of undergraduate courses was high due to a rigorous filtering process). However, in terms of an undergraduate education this was a misconception since many polytechnics offered academic degrees validated by the CNAA from bachelor's and master's degree to PhD research degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Harold: "Higher Education in the UK: A critical examination of the Role of the CNAA", ''Higher Education Journal'', Springer Netherlands, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Also professional degrees in, for instance, engineering, town planning, law, and architecture were rigorously validated by various professional institutions. Many polytechnics argued that a CNAA degree was superior to many university degrees especially in engineering, due to the external independent validation process employed by the CNAA, the oversight of the engineering institutions, and innovations such as [[sandwich degree]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/apr/04/theobserver.observerbusiness4|title=Design's angel of the North|date=2004-04-03|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such innovations made a polytechnic education more relevant for professional work in applying science and advanced technology in industry.&lt;ref&gt;Brosan, "The Development of Polytechnics in the UK", ''Paedagogica Europaea'', Vol 7, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://technicaleducationmatters.org/about/|title=About|website=technicaleducationmatters.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In UK culture an engineering, applied science and technological education tended to be looked down upon socially. Industries and activities such as "manufacturing" and "engineering" were perceived to be things of the past, boring and "dirty". This connection to polytechnics did not help their cause in terms of achieving status in the public eye. This attitude and influence led to an expansion of the more popular subjects in the "creative" industries such as fashion, arts and design, media studies, journalism, film studies, and sports management. This social influence caused many polytechnics to change their faculty of "Engineering" to faculty of "Design and Technology"

For many years a central admissions system for polytechnics was not seen as necessary. However, a large increase in applications resulted from funding cuts to universities in the early 1980s. The [[Polytechnics Central Admissions System]] was introduced and handled the years of entry from 1986 to 1992.

===Post-1992===
Under the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]] they became fully fledged universities. After 1992, the former polytechnics ("[[new universities]]") awarded their own degrees. Most sub-degree BTEC qualifications have been phased out of the new universities and transferred to colleges of further education.

The polytechnics changed their names when they gained university status. Some simply dropped "polytechnic" and added "university" to their titles. For example, the Huddersfield Polytechnic became the University of Huddersfield. However, this was often not possible as there was another university with the name. One alternative title was "Metropolitan University", because the institution was situated in a city or other large [[metropolitan area]]. Examples are [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] and [[London Metropolitan University]]. These titles are often shortened to "Met" (Man Met, London Met) or an [[acronym]] (MMU, LMU). Others adopted a name which reflects the local area, such as [[Nottingham Trent University]] (named after the River Trent which flows through Nottingham) and [[Sheffield Hallam University]] ("Hallam" refers to the area of South Yorkshire in which much of Sheffield is situated). [[Ulster Polytechnic]] remains the only polytechnic to unite with a university; this occurred in 1984.

The last degree-awarding institution to hold on to the name "polytechnic" after 1992 was Anglia Polytechnic University (which had only attained polytechnic status the previous year). The word was soon identified as being off-putting to potential students, and the university became known as [[Anglia Ruskin University]] from 2005. The name "polytechnic" ([[École Polytechnique]]) in continental Europe and the USA ([[MIT]]) are viewed and styled as globally elite universities specializing in STEM education where science, engineering and engineers are premier forward looking strategic professions.  This is in stark contrast to the culture and social identity of engineers in the UK.

==List of former polytechnics==
At their peak there were over thirty polytechnics in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the English ones being primarily located in urban areas large enough to support industry or commerce, from which they usually took the city name. 
These are now universities.

In England, there are:
*[[Anglia Ruskin University]], formerly Anglia Polytechnic (located in Cambridge and Chelmsford)
*[[Birmingham City University]], formerly [[Birmingham Polytechnic]]
*[[University of Brighton]], formerly Brighton Polytechnic
*[[Bournemouth University]], formerly Bournemouth Polytechnic
*[[University of Central Lancashire]], formerly Lancashire Polytechnic and before that Preston Polytechnic (until 1984)
*[[Coventry University]], formerly Coventry Polytechnic and Lanchester Polytechnic (until 1987)
*[[De Montfort University]] Leicester, formerly Leicester Polytechnic
*[[University of East London]], formerly North East London Polytechnic and Polytechnic of East London
*[[University of Greenwich]], formerly Woolwich Polytechnic (later Thames Polytechnic)
*[[University of Hertfordshire]], formerly Hatfield Polytechnic
*[[University of Huddersfield]], formerly Huddersfield Polytechnic
*[[Kingston University]], formerly Kingston Polytechnic
*[[Leeds Beckett University]], formerly Leeds Polytechnic and as Leeds Metropolitan University from 1998 to 2013
*[[University of Lincoln|Lincoln University]] was formed in part from Humberside Polytechnic which was briefly Humberside University
*[[Liverpool John Moores University]], formerly Liverpool Polytechnic
*[[London Metropolitan University]], formerly [[London Guildhall University|City of London Polytechnic]] and [[University of North London|Polytechnic of North London]]
*[[Manchester Metropolitan University]], formerly Manchester Polytechnic
*[[Middlesex University]], formerly Middlesex Polytechnic
*[[University of Northumbria at Newcastle]], formerly Newcastle Polytechnic
*[[Nottingham Trent University]], formerly Trent Polytechnic (later Nottingham Polytechnic)
*[[Oxford Brookes University]], formerly Oxford Polytechnic
*[[University of Plymouth]], Plymouth Polytechnic (until 1989), then Polytechnic South West
*[[University of Portsmouth]], formerly Portsmouth Polytechnic
*[[Sheffield Hallam University]], formerly Sheffield Polytechnic
*[[South Bank University]], formerly South Bank Polytechnic (in London)
*[[Staffordshire University]], formerly Staffordshire Polytechnic
*[[University of Sunderland]], formerly Sunderland Polytechnic
*[[Teesside University]], formerly Teesside Polytechnic
*[[University of the West of England]], formerly Bristol Polytechnic
*[[University of West London]], formerly Polytechnic of West London
*[[University of Westminster]], formerly Polytechnic of Central London and the Royal Polytechnic Institution – Regent Street
*[[University of Wolverhampton]], formerly Wolverhampton Polytechnic


In addition, Wales has
*[[University of South Wales]], formerly Polytechnic of Wales and University of Glamorgan 

and Northern Ireland has:
*[[New University of Ulster]] which was a [[plate glass university]]. It absorbed the former Ulster Polytechnic, afterwards it was known as the University of Ulster. It is now known as [[Ulster University]]

In Scotland there were comparable Higher Education institutions called [[Central Institution]]s but these very rarely used the designation "Polytechnic" in their titles; these also converted into universities.
* One institution that did briefly use the designation "Polytechnic" was [[Edinburgh Napier University]]. Between 1988 and 1992 the institution was known as Napier Polytechnic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Edinburgh Napier University|title=About Edinburgh Napier University|url=http://www.napier.ac.uk/aboutus/foi/Pages/AboutEdinburghNapierUniversity.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728015527/http://www.napier.ac.uk/aboutus/foi/Pages/AboutEdinburghNapierUniversity.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 July 2011|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pora Ora''' is a series of [[educational game]]s and [[Application software|apps]] for [[primary school]] [[child]]ren ages 5 to 12. Suitable for use at both [[school]] and home, kids can learn things like [[multiplication table]]s, [[mathematics]], [[spelling]], and more, while enjoying themselves with colourful games. Pora Ora is the first offering of Caped Koala Studios, which has offices in [[London, England|London]] and [[Poznan, Poland]].&lt;ref name="Caped Koala Studios"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Caped Koala|url=http://capedkoala.com/about.html|accessdate=8 Jan 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[company]] was founded by Neil Gallagher and Conor Murphy.

==Usage==
Pora Ora has a [[desktop computer|desktop]] version called Pora Pal HQ, where one can feed and care for the Pora Pals unlocked in the interconnected games and apps. Schools are able to use Pora Ora as a free resource to compliment [[classroom]] activities. [[Progress report]]s detailing a child’s activities are available to [[teacher]]s, outlining the child's key strengths and weaknesses. The program also allows teachers to control [[interactive]] features and tailor content to suit their class' needs. Teachers also have access to the Teachers Portal, where they can connect with teachers around the world and share resources and tips. The Teachers Portal also has its own unique [[newsfeed]] with educational stories, [[blog]]s, and videos, ensuring that ''Pora Ora'' provides an up-to-date news resource for [[educator]]s.

==Pora Pals==
Pora Pals are virtual [[pet]]s whose well-being depends on the player acquiring [[wisdom]], conducting exploration, and receiving points for creativity. As players progress in the game, they are rewarded with the opportunity to unlock new Pora Pals, including

*Bubble Dragons
*[[Bat (animal)|Bats]]
*[[Leopard]]s
*[[Bee]]s
*[[Iceberg]]s
*Nippers
*Water Stalkers
*[[Frog]]s

== Roobles ==
Roobles are the in-game [[money|currency]] of ''Pora Ora''. Players need to earn roobles in order to be able to 'purchase' new [[clothing|clothes]], furnishings, [[hairstyle]]s, and gaming features. Roobles are earned playing games and learning.

== Pora Pads ==
Each player has their own Pora Pad (virtual home) in Pora Pal HQ to decorate and furnish. Each Pora Pad has its own [[garden]], where Pora Pals hang out.

== Games ==
* [[Leapfrog]]
* Globetrotters
* Bubble Trouble

The '''Seal of Excellence for Handicrafts''' is awarded to [[handicraft]] products annually by [[UNESCO]].

The programme operates separately in several Asian regions: [[South East Asia]], [[Central Asia]], [[South Asia]] and [[East Asia]]. Although initiated and generally coordinated by UNESCO, several partner NGOs implement the program at regional and national levels. Products are submitted annually between April and June and judging takes place in September by an international panel of experts selected by UNESCO.

The stated objective of the Seal is to encourage artisans to produce handicrafts using traditional skills, patterns and themes in an innovative way, in order to ensure the continuity and sustainability of these traditions and skills. The program was established to promote the handicraft sector, which play an important economic and social role in [[developing countries]]. The award aims to promote sustainable livelihoods as well as encourage the continued use of [[traditional knowledge]].

Products can be submitted in one of 7 categories:
# Textiles
# Natural Fibre
# Ceramics
# Wood
# Stone
# Metal
# Other (including paintings)

==Judging criteria==
The products are judged according to a number of set criteria. The general criteria, which was updated for 2007, includes

* '''Excellence''': Demonstrated excellence and standard-setting quality in craftsmanship
* '''Authenticity''': Expression of cultural identity and traditional aesthetic values
* '''Innovation''': Innovative approach to design and production
* '''Eco-friendliness''': Respect for the environment in materials and production techniques
* '''Marketability''': The potential of the item in world markets

Pre-conditions include considerations of [[social responsibility]] in product, and that the product classify as a [[handicraft]] according to the definition that appears on [http://www.unescobkk.org/culture/craftseal UNESCO Bangkok's Seal of Excellence website]

==History==
The Seal was launched in [[South East Asia]] in 2001. In 2004 it expanded to [[Central Asia]] and [[South Asia]], and to [[East Asia]] in 2006. Future expansion is planned for other regions of the world.

'''Stagecast Creator''' is a [[visual programming language]] intended for use in teaching programming to children. It is based on the [[programming by demonstration]] concept, where rules are created by giving examples of what actions should take place in a given situation. It can be used to construct simulations, animations and games, which run under [[Java (programming language)|Java]] on any suitable platform.&lt;ref&gt;Your wish is my command: programming by example, Henry Lieberman, [[Morgan Kaufmann Publishers]], {{ISBN|978-1-55860-688-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
What is today known as Creator originally started as a project by Allen Cypher and [[David Canfield Smith]] in Apple's [[Apple Advanced Technology Group|Advanced Technology Group]] (ATG) known as '''KidSim'''. As the name implies, it was intended to allow kids to construct their own simulations, reducing the programming task to something that anyone could handle. Programming in Creator uses graphical rewrite rules augmented with non-graphical tests and actions.

In 1994, Kurt Schmucker became the project manager, and under him, the project was renamed '''Cocoa''', and expanded to include a [[Netscape]] plug-in. It was also repositioned as "Internet Authoring for Kids", as the Internet was becoming increasingly accessible. The project was officially announced on May 13, 1996. There were three releases:

* DR1 (Developer Release 1) on October 31, 1996
* DR2 in June, 1997
* DR3 in June, 1998

When [[Steve Jobs]] returned to Apple in 1997, he began dismantling a number of non-productive departments{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}. One of these was the ATG.  [[Larry Tesler]], Cypher, and Smith, left to form [[Stagecast Software]] after retaining the rights to the Cocoa system.

Apple went on to reuse the Cocoa name for the entirely unrelated [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa application framework]], which had originated as [[OpenStep]]. Apparently due to time constraints—it was easier to reuse an already-registered name than to register a new term.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==Description==
Creator is based on the idea of independent ''characters'' that have a graphical appearance and non-graphical properties. Each character has a list of rules that determine how it behaves. The rules are created ''by demonstrating'' what the character does in a specific situation. Each graphical rewrite rule is a ''before / after'' rule, stating that when the ''before'' conditions of the rule are met, the ''after'' actions of the rule are performed&lt;ref&gt;Repenning, A, [https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~ralex/papers/PDF/VL95-RuleBending.pdf "Bending the Rules:Steps Toward Semantically Enriched Graphical Rewrite Rules"], Proceeding of Visual Languages, Darmstadt, Germany, 1995, pp. 226-233.&lt;/ref&gt;.

For a simple example, let's consider a simulation showing a character walking across a field, jumping over any rocks it encounters. Such a simulation would start with the construction of the playfield, in this case a line of icons representing the grass and a few rocks. A character is then placed on the playfield and double-clicked to open a rule editor. The rule editor will start by displaying the current conditions, that is, the character is standing on the grass. Below is an area to place the various "after" conditions, in this case the user drags open the default grid to two spaces, drags the character into the new grid cell, say to the right, and closes the rule editor.

If the simulation is started at this point, the character will start walking across the playfield to the right until it reaches the first rock. Since there is no rule showing what should happen when a rock is to the character's right, the character simply stops. At this point the rule editor is opened again, but now it shows the new condition that applies, the character is to the left of a rock. The actions in this case would be two steps, the first showing the character moving up and to the right, the next down and to the right. When the simulation is re-run, the character will walk to the right, and then "jump" over the rocks. In this case the character will now stop moving when it reaches the side of the screen, and a new rule could be added at that point to "wrap around" to the left side again.

Additional rules can be added "on the fly" to flesh out the simulation. In this example additional rules would likely be added to allow the conditions to apply no matter which direction the character is walking, duplicating the existing set of two rules for movement to the left, and up and down. To make the simulation interactive, the "automatic movement" rules can be removed, and replaced by ones that move only when the cursor keys are held down, and jump only if the user presses space. Now the simulation becomes a simple game.

Many new features were added to the system during its evolution from KidSim/Cocoa to Creator. These include the introduction of 'jars' as a means of object classification, a new z-variable that allows Creator to simulate a 3-D space (as a stack of 2-D sheets), the ability to control more than one character at a time, and the option to redraw the screen only after all moves in a turn have been made.

In order to ensure Creator's cross-platform compatibility, the entire system was ported to the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]]. As Cocoa, the system was a Mac-only product and included an 'Autoplayer' functionality that allowed a Cocoa simulation to be run as a stand-alone program on any Mac. With the port to Java, Creator simulations can be posted on a Web page and run as an applet.

The essay first appeared in the ''[[Los Angeles Free Press]]'' in 1967 and is often cited as one of the first [[Underground press|underground]] publications to receive widespread recognition. It was reprinted over 500 times in the 1960s and was published in book form in 1969 by Contact Books and in 1970 by [[Pocket Books]].

The essay, published during the height of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], in which Farber was an active participant, draws an extended analogy between the status of students at [[California State University]] and the status of [[African American]]s.

Farber uses the term "[[nigger]]" in the title to connote what he perceived as a "master-slave" relationship in modern educational settings in which students were overly constrained and intellectually de-motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Theatre in education (TIE) originated in Britain in 1965. Monica Prendergast and Juliana Saxton cited TIE as "one of the two historic roots of applied theatre practice". TIE typically includes a theatre company performing in an educational setting (i.e. a school) for youth, including interactive and performative moments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote = |title = Applied Theatre, International Case Studies and Challenges for Practice|year = 2009|publisher = Intellect Publishers|location = Briston, UK|page = 7|editor = Monica Prendergast &amp; Juliana Saxton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a high-impact child-centred performance for a specifically targeted school audience became hugely popular. Due to small audiences students can be encouraged to participate through work in-role and through debate. Student experimentation can be supported with resource materials and training or support for the students by teachers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zsbjn39/revision/1|title= history of TIE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Need ==

Education is becoming like rote learning. The education the students are getting is not being applied creatively in any area. Contrary to this 'rote' education, TIE presents a different approach including discussions, contributions and creativity through performance. It fulfils all types of [[learning]] and enhances the development process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aate.com/?page=effects|title=Effect of drama|work=AMERICAN ALLIANCE FOR THEATRE &amp; EDUCATION}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/kannada/theatre/You-can-now-study-theatre-in-school/articleshow/30887799.cms|title=Times of india|work=YOU CAN NOW STUDY THEATER IN SCHOOL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difference between Drama in Education and Theatre in Education ==

In the last twenty years many books have appeared describing drama and theatre activities with children. These various labels are indicative of the range of the work and of the possible confusions that can arise. Some of the main areas of work are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ann Redington|first1=Christine|title=Theatre in education : an historical and analytical study.|journal=University of Glasgow|date= December 1979|pages=10–460|url=http://theses.gla.ac.uk/2535/1/1979redingtonphd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drama in Education'''
In the school curriculum, this is both a method and a subject. As a curriculum subject it uses various dramatic elements, and acting out. In many Secondary schools drama is now a separate department. In some Primary schools it is used as a method to teach a number of subjects.

'''Theatre in Education'''
A professional team of trained and experienced actor/teachers, who prepare relevant material/project/experiment to be presented in schools often involving more than one visit. These programmes are usually devised and researched by the team/teachers and are for small groups of one or two classes of a specific age. The aim of the programmes is essentially educational, and uses theatre, drama in education and teaching techniques for educational purposes. 
This work provides an educational aid, resource and stimulus for both teachers and pupils, but to do so it may vary from place to place, total participation sessions to performance and discussion. Theatre in Education can be considered as a method of work used by some companies all the time, and by others only occasionally. Many companies who use this method of work have, as their starting point, a strong left-wing or didactic approach to their subject matter, and they cannot be considered as mere tools of the education system. Rather, they act as outside questioners, looking at ideas and values in society.

== The main element of TIE ==

These are the following characteristics of TIE&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*There is a clear aim and educational objective running throughout this process.
*The cast should be small so actors must be versatile and often take several roles.
*A low budget project has to be taken so that actors can play [[Musical instruments|instruments]] too. 
*The production must be portable and the design of the production will be simple and representational.
*The exploration of issues has to be from various viewpoints, so that we can see the effect of the action upon a range of people.
*There should be involvement by the audience.
*They are rarely wholly [[naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] because narration is often used.
*As actors have multiple roles, the costume are representational and simple.
*For educating the audience facts and figures can be included.
*They may have a strong message or moral running throughout the production.

== How TIE can be used ==

TIE can create different kinds of productions:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Supported by resource materials, the production can be designed to stimulate reaction and participation from its small audience, through role play and debate. 
*By specifically targeting an area for a particular age group in a school’s personal, social and health education curriculum.
*For the young audience the production can be based on the traditional story, allowing a range of follow-up activities if desired.
*Linking the story to the given activities for very young children can provide opportunities for involvement. 
*For the adult age group some additional 'dramatizing' activities may be added e.g. learning parenting skills or preparing for employment.
*It should be organised meaningfully.

== In Schools ==

'''The Role of Teacher '''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Synkova|first1=Klara|title=Drama in Education|journal=The Charles University (Czech Republic)|url=http://conference.pixel-online.net/ICT4LL2012/common/download/Abstract_pdf/436-QIL61-ABS-Synkova-ICT2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative to knowledge dissemination, memory-based teaching, [[Drama games]] and fun during lessons leads to better engagement. Instead of simply lecturing, the teacher in the TIE setting can become a conceptual artist who moulds [[knowledge]], [[feelings]], [[thoughts]], [[sensation (psychology)|sensations]] and experience into an active and activating educational process. This is not about an artist in a traditional way. It’s more a way of thinking, perception of the world and its needs in right - brained way as non-linear, practical, intuitive, and holistic. 
*Teacher´s typology 
The personality of a teacher influences the use of drama in lessons.  According to Barucha, teacher types fall into four quadrants (see Figure 1).  Barucha differentiates two dimensions depending on the teacher’s behaviour, perception, values and attitudes: the interactivity level and the level of logical/emphatic thinking. Both dimensions operate on a whole scale in between the extreme values. 


'''The Role of Student'''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In this methodology the student need to understand that the role of the teacher changes. In TIE the student himself takes the initiative and responsibility. TIE demands much greater independence of thinking. In this process of structured learning, drama rehearsals require full dedication. Due to this and closer interpersonal interaction, the process can lead to more clashes compared to traditional class teaching. There are several issues apart from memory training, courage to act, and the ability to emerge from the shell that each of us adopts at work or at school, there can be language difficulties, stage fright, newness in being expected to adopt a role, confidence etc.

Summarizing the main requirements and preconditions as follows: -
*Intellectual maturity, ability to understand the play and roles
*Ability to comprehend the cost and investment, but also the benefits. Openness to accept new method of teaching/ learning.
*Time management or Commitment
*Acceptance of guiding role of the teacher without formal authority
*Language competence
*Performance skills/competence (active attitude to potential stage fright issues, memory issues etc.)
*Collective work competence 
*Controlling the emotional intelligence and Ability to cooperate even in stressful moments (like a performance).

==Some theatre improvisation games==
This are some theatre games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=David|title=101 Drama Games and Activities|date=2007|publisher=Lulu |edition=2nd|url=https://earthviaradio.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/drama_101_games_and_activities.pdf|ref=http://www.dramaresource.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1) '''Alphabet conversation'''

Having a group of student, start a conversation one by one where each sentence begins with the next letter of the alphabet. Giving a situation before you begin will help the student. Students can also use sounds to start a sentence, for example “Mmmm” or “tut-tut”.  This game can be played in pairs or small groups.  Here is an example:
 
A:   Anyone seen my cat?

B:   Black one, with funny eyes?

A:   Can’t say I remember.

B:   Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten what it looks like?

A:   Every cat looks the same to me.

B:   Fortunately, I found one yesterday

A:   Gee, that’s great…

*Try starting somewhere in the middle of the alphabet.  Then when you reach “Z”, return to “A” until you arrive back where you started. This technique can be combine with one word stories.

2) '''People poems'''

Divide the class into small group of four or five. To each group give a topic/word –e.g. “Time”. Now each person in an each group as to write down or remembers some words associated with the theme, e.g.- slow, fast, boredom, quickly and centuries. Now every group has to make an object out of the members, linked to the theme (such as a clock). Ideally the group object should move. 
Next every group has to bring the object to life and works out a way of bringing in some or all of their words-linked to their movements. And at the end they show the resulting people poem to the rest of the class, who can try and guess the theme.
Themes can include: 
* Elements - earth, air, fire, water 
* Opposites – cold/hot, fast/slow, high/low 
* Colours
* Emotions

== Benefits ==
These are some benefits of TIE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.DramaEd.netCopyright|title=Benefits of Drama}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edartes.it/doc/Gaetano_Oliva,_Education_to_Theatricality_inside_Secondary_School,_Art_and_Body.pdf|title=Education to Theatricality inside Secondary School, Art and Body}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Self-Confidence''': By performing in front audience the student get the [[confidence]] to trust on his own ideas and abilities.  This will be applied to his life, career and school.
* 
* '''Imagination''': Thinking out of the box, and interpreting familiar material in new ways. [[Einstein]] said, “Imagination is more important than knowledge.”
* 
* '''Empathy''': Acting in a roles for different situations, time periods, and different [[cultures]] promotes compassion and it develops tolerance for others’ feelings and viewpoints.
* 
* '''Collaboration''': It combines the new ideas and abilities of its participants. This [[cooperative learning]] includes discussing, sharing, negotiating, rehearsing, and [[performing]].
* 
* '''Concentration''': Performing in a [[play (theatre)|play]] develops a constant focus of [[mind]], body, and [[voice]], which also helps in life and in school subjects.
* 
* '''Communication Skills''': In a play a student enhances [[Language|verbal]] and [[nonverbal]] expression of ideas. It also improves voice projection, articulation of words, and fluency with language. 
* 
* '''Emotional Outlet''': In the play the student is allowed to express a range of emotions. Sadness, aggression and tension are released in a safe, controlled environment, reducing antisocial [[behaviours]].
* 
* '''Relaxation''': Theatre activities reduce stress by releasing mental, physical, and emotional tension.
* 
* '''Physical Fitness''': Movement in drama improves body balance, coordination, flexibility, and control.

== History ==

Since then, over a hundred animated short films have been created by more than 500 children enrolled in the program.
