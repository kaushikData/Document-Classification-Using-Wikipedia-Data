==Biography==
Coutsoudis received her BSc from the [[University of Natal]] in 1974, followed by a Higher Diploma in Education in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whoswho.co.za/anna-coutsoudis-5057|title=Anna Coutsoudis|publisher=Who's Who Southern Africa|accessdate=18 October 2017 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, while raising a family, she completed her studies at the same university, earning a PhD from the Department of Paediatrics and Child Health with a thesis titled ''Epidemiological and clinical studies of vitamin A in Black South African pre-school children''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oatd.org/oatd/record?record=handle%5C:10413%5C%2F7451&amp;q=%2A%3A%2A|title=Epidemiological and clinical studies of vitamin A in Black South African pre-school children|author=Coutsoudis, Anna|publisher=Open Access Theses and Dissertations|year=1993|accessdate=18 October 2017 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=asgm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chs.ukzn.ac.za/news/09-10-22/ACADEMY_OF_SCIENCE_GOLD_MEDAL_FOR_PROMINENT_UKZN_SCIENTIST.aspx|title=Academy of Science Gold Medal for Prominent UKZN Scientist

She was honoured by an award from [[La Leche League International]] in 2001 for stressing the benefits of breastfeeding while in 2004 her extensive work on nutrition research was recognized by the Nutrition Society of South Africa.&lt;ref name=asgm/&gt;

In Mexico at the [[International AIDS Society]] Conference in 2008, Coutsoudis presented a convincing and well-received paper which stressed the benefits of breastfeeding for HIV-affected infants.&lt;ref name="Susser2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Susser|first=Ida|title=AIDS, Sex, and Culture: Global Politics and Survival in Southern Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qaeg6RqZb0YC&amp;pg=RA1-PA1951|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5910-7|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year,  an article she and her colleague [[Hoosen Coovadia]] published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' called on the South African government to stop providing free formula milk to HIV-infected mothers, causing outrage from HIV activists. In particular, Cousoudis criticized the commercial promotion of formula milk for young babies in South Africa, especially as it countered recommendations from the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2009-08-25-professors-provoke-breastfeeding-outrage|title=Professors provoke breastfeeding outrage|publisher=''Mail &amp; Guardian''|author=Barrett, Sara|date=25 August 2009|accessdate=18 October 2017 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, Coutsoudis participated in the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]'s 60th conference in [[Vienna]] where she was a key speaker at a well-attended event on "Nuclear Techniques to Assess Breastfeeding Practices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndaba-online.ukzn.ac.za/UkzndabaStory/162/nuclear-techniques-to-assess-breastfeeding-practices-/#sthash.mF8XN9XN.dpbs|title=Nuclear Techniques to Assess Breastfeeding Practices |publisher=University of KwaZulu-Natal: UKZNDADA online|author=Francis, MaryAnn|date=13 October 2016|accessdate=19 October 2017 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coutsoudis has served on various committees of the World Health Organizaion including the Steering Committee of the Child and Adolescent Health Unit and guideline development groups on [[Vitamin A]] Supplementation and HIV and Infant Feeding.&lt;ref name=dpch/&gt; She has published over 100 [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] scientific articles.&lt;ref&gt;USA, Gov.

The '''Austrian Latin America Institute''' (''Österreichisches Lateinamerika-Institut'', LAI) is an interdisciplinary orientated organisation, aiming at intensifying dialogue and exchange between [[Austria]] and [[Latin America]]. It was founded as an association in 1965 and receives subsidies for its work in development politics as well as scientific and cultural events and projects. About half of the annual budget originates from its own resources, mainly language courses as well as membership fees. In 1994 the institute moved to the historic Palais Schlick in [[Vienna]]'s 9th district [[Alsergrund]].

Charles was born at [[Buckingham Palace]] as the first grandchild of [[King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]].

After earning a bachelor of arts degree from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], Charles served in the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Royal Navy]] from 1971 to 1976.

In 1981, he married [[Lady Diana Spencer]] and they had two sons: [[Prince William]] (b. 1982)—later to become [[Duke of Cambridge]]—and [[Prince Harry]] (b. 1984)—later to become [[Duke of Sussex]].

The death of his grandfather and the accession of his mother as Queen Elizabeth II in 1952 made Charles her [[heir apparent]]. As the monarch's eldest son, he automatically took the titles [[Duke of Cornwall]], [[Duke of Rothesay]], [[Earl of Carrick]], [[Baron of Renfrew (title)|Baron of Renfrew]], [[Lord of the Isles]] and [[Prince and Great Steward of Scotland]].{{sfn|Brandreth|p=127|2007}} Charles attended [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|his mother's coronation]] at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 2 June 1953. As was customary for upper-class children at the time, a [[governess]], Catherine Peebles, was appointed and undertook his education between the ages of five and eight. Buckingham Palace announced in 1955 that Charles would attend school rather than have a private tutor, making him the first heir apparent ever to be educated in that manner.&lt;ref name="time 1988"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Growing Up Royal |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=25 April 1988 |url=http://www.time.com/time/daily/special/diana/readingroom/8191/4_25.html |accessdate=4 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050331004503/http://www.time.com/time/daily/special/diana/readingroom/8191/4_25.html |archivedate=31 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles attended [[Hill House School]] in west London. He did not receive preferential treatment from the school's founder and then-head, [[Stuart Townend (headmaster)|Stuart Townend]], who advised the Queen to have Charles train in [[Association football|football]] because the boys were never deferential to anyone on the football field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Lieutenant Colonel H.

It taught me to accept challenges and take the initiative."

Upon his return to Gordonstoun, Charles emulated his father in becoming [[Head girl and head boy|Head Boy]].

==Military training and career==
Charles followed family tradition when he served in the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Royal Navy]]. During his second year at Cambridge, he requested and received Royal Air Force training. On 8 March 1971, he flew himself to the Royal Air Force College [[RAF Cranwell|Cranwell]] to train as a jet pilot.{{sfn|Brandreth|pp=169–170|2007}} After the passing-out parade that September, he embarked on a naval career and enrolled in a six-week course at the Royal Naval College Dartmouth. He then served on the guided missile destroyer {{HMS|Norfolk|D21|6}} (1971–1972) and the frigates {{HMS|Minerva|F45|6}} (1972–1973) and {{HMS|Jupiter|F60|6}} (1974). In 1974, he qualified as a helicopter pilot at [[RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron)|RNAS Yeovilton]], and then joined 845 Naval Air Squadron, operating from {{HMS|Hermes|R12|6}}.{{sfn|Brandreth|p=170|2007}}

On 9 February 1976, he took command of the coastal minehunter {{HMS|Bronington|M1115|6}} for his last ten months of active service in the navy.{{sfn|Brandreth|p=170|2007}} He learned to fly on a [[De Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk|Chipmunk]] basic pilot trainer, a [[BAC Jet Provost]] jet trainer, and a [[Beagle Basset]] multi-engine trainer; he then regularly flew the [[Hawker Siddeley Andover]], [[Westland Wessex]] and [[BAe 146]] aircraft of [[The Queen's Flight]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Military Career of the Prince of Wales|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/the-prince-of-wales/biography/military-career#na|publisher=Prince of Wales |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; until he gave up flying after crashing the [[BAe 146]] in the [[Hebrides]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=187927|title=Incident British Aerospace BAe-146-100 ZE700, 29 Jun 1994|first=Harro|last=Ranter|website=aviation-safety.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/prince-gives-up-flying-royal-aircraft-after-hebrides-crash-1592247.html|title=Prince gives up flying royal aircraft after Hebrides crash|work=The Independent|author=Steve Boggan|date=19 July 1995|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early romances==
[[File:HRH Prince Charles 43 Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|
Portrait of the Prince in [[Buckingham Palace]], 1974, by [[Allan Warren]]]]
In his youth, Charles was amorously linked to a number of women. His great-uncle [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] advised him:&lt;blockquote&gt;In a case like yours, the man should sow his wild oats and have as many affairs as he can before settling down, but for a wife he should choose a suitable, attractive, and sweet-charactered girl before she has met anyone else she might fall for&amp;nbsp;... It is disturbing for women to have experiences if they have to remain on a pedestal after marriage.{{sfn|Junor|p=72|2005}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Charles's girlfriends included Georgiana Russell, the daughter of the [[John Russell (diplomat)|British Ambassador to Spain]];{{sfn|Brandreth|p=192|2007}} Lady Jane Wellesley, the daughter of the [[8th Duke of Wellington]];{{sfn|Brandreth|p=193|2007}} Davina Sheffield;{{sfn|Brandreth|p=194|2007}} [[Lady Sarah Spencer]];{{sfn|Brandreth|p=195|2007}} and [[Camilla Shand]],{{sfn|Brandreth|p=178|2007}} who later became his second wife and Duchess of Cornwall.{{sfn|Brandreth|pp=15–17|2007}}

Early in 1974, Mountbatten began corresponding with Charles about a potential marriage to [[Amanda Knatchbull]], who was Mountbatten's granddaughter.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=204–206|1994}}{{sfn|Brandreth|p=200|2007}} Charles wrote to Amanda's mother—[[Patricia Knatchbull, 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma|Lady Brabourne]], who was also his [[Godparent|godmother]]—expressing interest in her daughter, to which she replied approvingly, though she suggested that a [[courtship]] with the not yet 17-year-old girl was premature.{{sfn|Dimbleby|p=263|1994}} Four years later, Mountbatten arranged for Amanda and himself to accompany Charles on his 1980 tour of India. Both fathers, however, objected; Philip feared that Charles would be eclipsed by his famous uncle (who had served as the last British [[Viceroy]] and first [[Governor-General of India]]), while [[John Knatchbull, 7th Baron Brabourne|Lord Brabourne]] warned that a joint visit would concentrate media attention on the cousins before they could decide on becoming a couple.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=263–265|1994}} However, in August 1979, before Charles would depart alone for India, Mountbatten was killed by the IRA. When Charles returned, he proposed to Amanda,&lt;!--Brandreth p 202 says Charles proposed two weeks before the assassination and that Amanda turned him down then, before Mountbatten's death--&gt; but in addition to her grandfather, she had lost her paternal grandmother and youngest brother [[Nicholas Knatchbull|Nicholas]] in the bomb attack and was now reluctant to join the royal family.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=263–265|1994}} In June 1980, Charles officially turned down [[Chevening]] House, placed at his disposal since 1974, as his future residence. Chevening, a [[stately home]] in Kent, was bequeathed, along with an [[financial endowment|endowment]], to the Crown by the last [[James Stanhope, 7th Earl Stanhope|Earl Stanhope]], Amanda's childless great-uncle, in the hope that Charles would eventually occupy it.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=299–300|1994}} In 1977, a newspaper report mistakenly announced his engagement to [[Princess Marie-Astrid of Luxembourg]].{{sfn|Brandreth|p=196|2007}}

==Marriages==
===Marriage to Lady Diana Spencer===
{{Main|Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer}}
[[File:Charles and Di. Uluru. March 83.JPG|thumb|The Prince and Princess of Wales visit [[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock), Australia, March 1983]]
Charles first met [[Lady Diana Spencer]] in 1977 while he was visiting her home, [[Althorp]]. He was the companion of her elder sister, [[Lady Sarah McCorquodale|Sarah]], and did not consider Diana romantically until mid-1980. While they were sitting together on a bale of hay at a friend's barbecue in July, he mentioned Mountbatten's death, to which Diana replied that Charles had looked forlorn and in need of care during his uncle's funeral. Soon, according to Charles's chosen biographer, [[Jonathan Dimbleby]], "without any apparent surge in feeling, he began to think seriously of her as a potential bride", and she accompanied Charles on visits to [[Balmoral Castle]] and [[Sandringham House]].{{sfn|Dimbleby|p=279|1994}}

Charles's cousin [[Norton Knatchbull, 8th Baron Brabourne|Norton Knatchbull]] and his wife told Charles that Diana appeared awestruck by his position and that he did not seem to be in love with her.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=280–282|1994}} Meanwhile, the couple's continuing courtship attracted intense attention from the press and [[paparazzi]]. When Prince Philip told him that the media speculation would injure Diana's reputation if Charles did not come to a decision about marrying her soon, and realising that she was a suitable royal bride (according to Mountbatten's criteria), Charles construed his father's advice as a warning to proceed without further delay.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=281–283|1994}}

Prince Charles proposed to Diana in February 1981; she accepted and they married in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] on 29 July of that year. Upon his marriage, Charles reduced his voluntary tax contribution from the profits generated by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] from 50% to 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[New Statesman]] |location=UK | date=13 July 2009 | title=Royally Minted: What we give them and how they spend it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple lived at [[Kensington Palace]] and at [[Highgrove House]], near [[Tetbury]], and had two children: Princes [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|William]] (b. 1982) and [[Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex|Henry]] (known as "Harry") (b. 1984). Charles set a precedent by being the first royal father to be present at his children's births.&lt;ref name="time 1988"/&gt;

====Separation and divorce====
Within five years, the marriage was in trouble due to the couple's incompatibility and near thirteen-year age difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Tina|title=The Diana Chronicles|year=2007|page=720}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Smith|p=561|2000}} Charles resumed his relationship with his former girlfriend Camilla Parker Bowles, and Diana began one with Major [[James Hewitt]], the family's former riding instructor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Princess Diana’s Former Lover Maintains He Is Not Prince Harry’s Father |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/03/james-hewitt-prince-harry-father-princess-diana |accessdate=25 November 2018 |publisher=Vanity fair |date=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their evident discomfort in each other's company led to them being dubbed "The Glums" by the press.&lt;ref name="Quest"&gt;Quest, Richard (3 June 2002).

Audio tapes of her own extramarital flirtations also surfaced.&lt;ref name="Quest"/&gt; Persistent suggestions that Hewitt is Prince Harry's father have been based on a physical similarity between Hewitt and Harry. However, Harry had already been born by the time Diana's affair with Hewitt began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2273498.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Hewitt denies Prince Harry link | date=21 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Holder, Margaret|url=http://www.themortonreport.com/celebrity/royals/who-does-prince-harry-look-like/|title=Who Does Prince Harry Look Like?

In December 1992, British Prime Minister [[John Major]] announced the couple's formal separation in Parliament. Earlier that year, the British press had published transcripts of a passionate bugged telephone conversation between Charles and Camilla from 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textfiles.com/phreak/camilla.txt "The Camillagate Tapes"], 18 December 1989, phone transcript, Phone Phreaking&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5258604.stm|title=Royals caught out by interceptions|date=29 November 2006|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Charles sought public understanding via a televised interview with [[Jonathan Dimbleby]] on 29 June 1994.

The engagement of Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles was announced on 10 February 2005; he presented her with an engagement ring that had belonged to [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|his grandmother]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wickell|first=Carly|title=Camilla's Engagement Ring|url=http://jewelry.about.com/od/engagementrings/a/camilla_ring.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=22 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110233046/http://jewelry.about.com/od/engagementrings/a/camilla_ring.htm|archivedate=10 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen's consent to the marriage (as required by the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]]) was recorded in a [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] meeting on 2 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page496.asp |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101103140224/http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page496.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 November 2010 |title=Order in Council, 2 March 2005 |publisher=Privy-council.org.uk |accessdate=20 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the [[Department of Justice (Canada)|Department of Justice]] announced its decision that the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] was not required to meet to give its consent to the marriage, as the union would not result in offspring and would have no impact on the succession to the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian throne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Valpy |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Valpy |title=Scholars scurry to find implications of royal wedding |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=2 November 2005 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=https://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2FArticleNews%2FTPStory%2FLAC%2F20050211%2FPROTOCOL11%2FTPInternational&amp;ord=5357017&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;force_login=true |accessdate=4 March 2009 |location=Toronto }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles was the only member of the Royal Family to have a civil rather than a church wedding in England. Government documents from the 1950s and 1960s, published by the BBC, stated that such a marriage was illegal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/4262943.stm |title=Possible bar to wedding uncovered |publisher=BBC News |date=14 February 2005 |accessdate=12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; though these were dismissed by Charles's spokesman,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/4262963.stm | title=Panorama Lawful impediment? |publisher=BBC News |date=14 February 2005 |accessdate=25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and explained to be obsolete by the sitting government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050224/text/50224-51.htm#50224-51_head0 |title=Royal Marriage; Lords Hansard Written Statements 24 Feb 2005 : Column WS87 (50224-51) |author=The Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor (Lord Falconer of Thoroton) |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=24 February 2005 |accessdate=12 October 2008}} Excerpt: "The Government are satisfied that it is lawful for the Prince of Wales and Mrs Parker Bowles, like anyone else, to marry by a civil ceremony in accordance with Part III of the Marriage Act 1949. ¶ Civil marriages were introduced in England, by the Marriage Act 1836. Section 45 said that the Act&amp;nbsp;... shall not extend to the marriage of any of the Royal Family". ¶ But the provisions on civil marriage in the 1836 Act were repealed by the Marriage Act 1949. All remaining parts of the 1836 Act, including Section 45, were repealed by the Registration Service Act 1953. No part of the 1836 Act, therefore, remains on the statute book."&lt;/ref&gt;

The marriage was scheduled to take place in a civil ceremony at [[Windsor Castle]], with a subsequent religious blessing at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor|St George's Chapel]]. The venue was subsequently changed to [[Windsor Guildhall]], because a civil marriage at Windsor Castle would oblige the venue to be available to anyone who wished to be married there. Four days before the wedding, the originally scheduled date of 8 April was postponed until the following day in order to allow Charles and some of the invited dignitaries to attend the [[funeral of Pope John Paul II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pope funeral delays royal wedding|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4409507.stm|accessdate=22 August 2013|date=4 April 2005|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles's parents did not attend the civil marriage ceremony; the Queen's reluctance to attend probably arose from her position as [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4289417.stm |title=Q&amp;A: Queen's wedding decision |publisher=BBC News |date=23 February 2005 |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh did attend the [[service of worship|service]] of [[blessing]] and later held a reception for the newlyweds at Windsor Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/04/09/world/main686994.shtml |title=Charles And Camilla Finally Wed, After 30 Years Of Waiting, Prince Charles Weds His True Love|publisher= CBS News |date= 9 April 2005|accessdate=12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blessing, by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Rowan Williams]], at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], was televised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oliver|first=Mark|title=Charles and Camilla wed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/apr/09/monarchy.markoliver|accessdate=22 August 2013|date=9 April 2005|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social interests==
===Philanthropy and charity===

Since founding [[The Prince's Trust]] in 1976, Charles has established sixteen more charitable organisations, and now serves as president of all of those.&lt;ref name="Charities"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prince's Charities|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/theprinceofwales/atwork/theprincescharities/|publisher=Prince of Wales |accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these form a loose alliance called [[The Prince's Charities]], which describes itself as "the largest multi-cause charitable enterprise in the United Kingdom, raising over £100 million annually&amp;nbsp;... [and is] active across a broad range of areas including education and young people, environmental sustainability, the built environment, responsible business and enterprise and international."&lt;ref name="Charities"/&gt;

In 2010, [[The Prince's Charities#The Prince's Charities Canada|The Prince's Charities Canada]] was established in a similar fashion to its namesake in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/prince-charles-rallies-top-level-support-for-his-canadian-causes/article2437881/| last=Mackreal| first=Kim| title=Prince Charles rallies top level support for his Canadian causes| date=18 May 2012| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles is also [[patron]] of over 350 other charities and organisations,&lt;ref name=patron&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/theprinceofwales/patronages/index.html |title=Patronages |publisher=Prince of Wales |accessdate=12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and carries out duties related to these throughout the [[Commonwealth realm]]s; for example, he uses [[Royal tours of Canada|his tours]] of Canada as a way to help draw attention to youth, the disabled, the environment, the arts, medicine, the elderly, heritage conservation, and education.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/biography.htm |title=Royal Visit 2001 |publisher=Canadianheritage.gc.ca |accessdate=12 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922153922/http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/biography.htm |archivedate=22 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, Charles has supported humanitarian projects. Along with his two sons, he took part in ceremonies that marked the 1998 [[International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; Charles has also set up [[The Prince's Charities#The Prince's Charities Canada|The Prince's Charities Australia]], which is based in [[Melbourne, Victoria]]. The Prince's Charities Australia is to provide a coordinating presence for the Prince of Wales's Australian and international charitable endeavours&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princescharitiesaustralia.org.au/contact-us |title=Contact Us |publisher=The Prince's Charities Australia |accessdate=22 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809232135/http://www.princescharitiesaustralia.org.au/contact-us |archivedate= 9 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles was one of the first world leaders to express strong concerns about the human rights record of Romanian dictator [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], initiating objections in the international arena,{{sfn|Dimbleby|p=250|1994}} and subsequently supported the FARA Foundation,&lt;ref name=patron/&gt; a charity for Romanian orphans and abandoned children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faracharity.org/ |title=FARA Charity |publisher=FARA Enterprises |accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2013, Charles donated an unspecified sum of money to the British Red Cross Syria Crisis appeal and DEC Syria appeal, which is run by 14 British charities to help victims of the [[Syrian civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince Charles makes 'generous' Syria donation|url=http://www.thecommentator.com/article/3077/prince_charles_makes_generous_syria_donation|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=thecommentator.com|date=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince Charles makes 'generous' Syria donation |url=http://www.turknewsline.com/prince-charles-makes-generous-syria-donation/ |accessdate=19 April 2013 |newspaper=www.turknewsline.com/ |date=28 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502033337/http://www.turknewsline.com/prince-charles-makes-generous-syria-donation/ |archivedate=2 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', It is believed that after turning 65 years old in 2013, Charles donated his state pension to an unnamed charity that supports elderly people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Addley|first1=Esther|title=Prince Charles to claim state pension – and donate it to charity|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/07/prince-charles-claim-state-pension-navy-donate-charity|accessdate=27 July 2014|work=The Guardian|date=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, Charles arranged for five million measles-rubella vaccinations for children in the [[Philippines]] on the outbreak of measles in South-East Asia. According to Clarence House, Charles was affected by news of the damage caused by [[Typhoon Yolanda]] in 2013.

===Built environment===
The Prince of Wales has openly expressed his views on architecture and [[urban planning]]; he fostered the advancement of [[New Classical Architecture]] and asserted that he "care[s] deeply about issues such as the environment, architecture, inner-city renewal, and the quality of life."&lt;ref name="planetizen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles, Prince of Wales|url=http://www.planetizen.com/topthinkers/charles|publisher=Planetizen|date=13 September 2009|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Charles' 60th|url=http://www.plannedseniorhood.com/index.php/prince-charles-60th|work=10 interesting facts about Prince Charles|publisher=Planned Seniorhood|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech given for the 150th anniversary of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) on 30 May 1984, he memorably described a proposed extension to the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery in London]] as a "monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved friend" and deplored the "glass stumps and concrete towers" of modern architecture.&lt;ref name="RIBA speech"&gt;[http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_at_the_150th_anniversary_1876801621.html Text of the Prince of Wales's speech at the 150th anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213205/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_at_the_150th_anniversary_1876801621.html |date=27 September 2007 }} Royal Gala Evening at Hampton Court Palace, 30 May 1984.

What is wrong with them? Why has everything got to be vertical, straight, unbending, only at right angles – and functional?&lt;ref name="RIBA speech"/&gt;}}

[[File:Prince Charles 2000.jpg|thumb|The Prince of Wales at the newly opened [[We The Curious|@Bristol]], 14 June 2000]]

His book and BBC documentary ''A Vision of Britain'' (1987) was also critical of modern architecture, and he has continued to campaign for traditional urbanism, human scale, restoration of historic buildings, and sustainable design,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Prince of Wales Accepts Vincent Scully Prize|url=http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=15419&amp;int_modo=1|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=artdaily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite criticism in the press. Two of his charities ([[The Prince's Regeneration Trust]] and [[The Prince's Foundation for Building Community]]) promote his views, and the village of [[Poundbury]] was built on land owned by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] to a master plan by [[Léon Krier]] under the guidance of Prince Charles and in line with his philosophy.&lt;ref name="planetizen"/&gt;

Charles helped establish a national trust for the built environment in Canada after lamenting, in 1996, the unbridled destruction of many of the country's historic urban cores. He offered his assistance to the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] in creating a trust modelled on Britain's [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], a plan that was implemented with the passage of the [[2007 Canadian federal budget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.budget.gc.ca/2007/pdf/bp2007e.pdf| last=Department of Finance| title=The Budget Plan 2007: Aspire to a Stronger, Safer, Better Canada| pages=99| date=19 March 2007| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the Prince agreed to the use of his title for the [[Prince of Wales Prize for Municipal Heritage Leadership]], awarded by the [[Heritage Canada]] Foundation to municipal governments that have shown sustained commitment to the conservation of historic places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagecanada.org/eng/services/winners.html#pow |title=Heritage Services |publisher=Heritage Canada Foundation |accessdate=12 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914170352/http://www.heritagecanada.org/eng/services/winners.html |archivedate=14 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While visiting the United States and surveying the damage caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]], Charles received the [[National Building Museum]]'s [[Vincent Scully Prize]] in 2005, for his efforts in regard to architecture; he donated $25,000 of the prize money towards restoring storm-damaged communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hales|first=Linda|title=Prince Charles to Accept Scully Prize at Building Museum|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/25/AR2005102501514.html|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=26 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prince of Wales Accepts Vincent Scully Prize|url=http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=15419&amp;int_modo=1 |publisher=artdaily.com|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, he received the 10th annual [[Global Environmental Citizen Award]] from the [[Harvard Medical School]]'s Center for Health and the Global Environment, the director of which, [[Eric Chivian]], stated: "For decades the Prince of Wales has been a champion of the natural world&amp;nbsp;...

In 2007, Charles launched [[The Prince's May Day Network]], which encourages businesses to take action on [[climate change]]. Speaking to the [[European Parliament]] on 14 February 2008, he called for European Union leadership in the war against climate change. During the standing ovation that followed, [[Nigel Farage]], the leader of the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP), remained seated and went on to describe Charles's advisers as "naive and foolish at best."&lt;ref&gt;Farage continued: "How can somebody like Prince Charles be allowed to come to the European Parliament at this time to announce he thinks it should have more powers? It would have been better for the country he wants to rule one day if he had stayed home and tried to persuade [[Gordon Brown]] to give the people the promised referendum [on the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]]." {{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7245183.stm |title=UKIP anger at prince's EU speech|date=14 February 2008|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech to the Low Carbon Prosperity Summit in a European Parliament chamber on 9 February 2011, Charles said that climate change sceptics are playing "a reckless game of roulette" with the planet's future and are having a "corrosive effect" on public opinion. He also articulated the need to protect fisheries and the Amazon rain forest, and to make low-carbon emissions affordable and competitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apnews.myway.com//article/20110209/D9L9BNPO1.html |title=UK's Prince Charles blasts climate-change skeptics |publisher=Apnews.myway.com |date=9 February 2011 |accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 August 2012, the Prince of Wales addressed the International Union for Conservation of Nature – World Conservation Congress, supporting the view that grazing animals are needed to keep soils and grassland productive:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have been particularly fascinated, for example, by the work of a remarkable man called [[Allan Savory]], in [[Zimbabwe]] and other [[semi arid]] areas, who has argued for years against the prevailing expert view that is the simple numbers of cattle that drive overgrazing and cause fertile land to become desert. On the contrary, as he has since shown so graphically, the land needs the presence of feeding animals and their droppings for the cycle to be complete, so that soils and grassland areas stay productive. Such that, if you take grazers off the land and lock them away in vast [[feedlots]], the land dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Charles sends a message to IUCN's World Conservation Congress |url=http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/multimedia/video/?10774/Prince-Charles-sends-a-message-to-IUCNs-World-Conservation-Congress |publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature |accessdate=6 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315111928/http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/multimedia/video/?10774%2FPrince-Charles-sends-a-message-to-IUCNs-World-Conservation-Congress |archivedate=15 March 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In February 2014, Charles visited the [[Somerset levels]] to meet residents affected by [[Winter flooding of 2013–14 on the Somerset Levels|winter flooding]]. During his visit, Charles remarked that "There's nothing like a jolly good disaster to get people to start doing something. The tragedy is that nothing happened for so long."

===Alternative medicine===
[[File:Duchess of Cornwall, Prince of Wales - NIH.jpg|thumb|The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall with [[NIH]] Director [[Elias Zerhouni]] and Surgeon-General [[Richard Carmona]], November 2005]]

In April 2008, ''[[The Times]]'' published a letter from [[Edzard Ernst]], Professor of Complementary Medicine at the University of Exeter, which asked the Prince's Foundation to recall two guides promoting alternative medicine, saying "the majority of alternative therapies appear to be clinically ineffective, and many are downright dangerous." A speaker for the foundation countered the criticism by stating: "We entirely reject the accusation that our online publication ''Complementary Healthcare: A Guide'' contains any misleading or inaccurate claims about the benefits of complementary therapies. On the contrary, it treats people as adults and takes a responsible approach by encouraging people to look at reliable sources of information&amp;nbsp;... so that they can make informed decisions. The foundation does not promote complementary therapies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/prince-of-waless-guide-to-alternative-medicine-inaccurate-glgfl26ph56|title=Prince of Wales's guide to alternative medicine 'inaccurate'|last=Henderson|first=Mark|date=17 April 2008|work=The Times |location=London |accessdate=30 August 2008}} {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Ernst published a book with [[Simon Singh]], mockingly dedicated to "HRH the Prince of Wales" called ''[[Trick or Treatment|Trick or Treatment: Alternative Medicine on Trial]]''.

The Prince's [[Waitrose Duchy Organic|Duchy Originals]] produce a variety of complementary medicinal products including a "Detox Tincture" that Edzard Ernst has denounced as "financially exploiting the vulnerable" and "outright [[quackery]]".&lt;ref name=TelegraphAltMed&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mandrake/6474595/Prince-Charles-lobbies-Andy-Burnham-on-complementary-medicine-for-NHS.html | date=31 October 2009|work=The Telegraph |location=UK |author=Walker, Tim |title=Prince Charles lobbies Andy Burnham on complementary medicine for NHS | accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] criticised an email that Duchy Originals had sent out to advertise its Echina-Relief, Hyperi-Lift and Detox Tinctures products saying that it was misleading.&lt;ref name=TelegraphAltMed/&gt; The Prince personally wrote at least seven letters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcscience.net/?p=89|title=HRH "meddling in politics"|date=12 March 2007|publisher=DC's Improbable Science|author=[[David Colquhoun|Colquhoun, David]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA) shortly before they relaxed the rules governing labelling of such herbal products, a move that has been widely condemned by scientists and medical bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/doctors-attack-natural-remedy-claims-mchf8nkw22j |work=The Times |location=UK | date=1 September 2006 | title=Doctors attack natural remedy claims|author1=Nigel Hawkes |author2=Mark Henderson }} {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, it was reported that Charles had personally lobbied the Health Secretary, [[Andy Burnham]], regarding greater provision of alternative treatments in the NHS.&lt;ref name=TelegraphAltMed/&gt; In 2016, Charles said in a speech that he used [[homeopathy|homeopathic]] veterinary medicines to reduce antibiotic use at his farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/12/prince-charles-use-homeopathy-in-animals-to-cut-antibiotic-use|title=Prince Charles: I use homeopathy in animals to cut antibiotic use|work=The Guardian|date=12 May 2016|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ernst's book ''More Good Than Harm? The Moral Maze of Complementary and Alternative Medicine'' he and ethicist Kevin Smith call Charles "foolish and immoral" and "conclude that it is not possible to practice alternative medicine ethically". Ernst further claims that the private secretary of the Prince contacted the vice chancellor of Exeter University to investigate Ernst's complaints against the "Smallwood Report" which the Prince had commissioned in 2005. While Ernst was "found not to be guilty of any wrong-doing, all local support at Exeter stopped, which eventually led to my early retirement."&lt;ref name="SI 2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ernst|first1=Edzard|authorlink=Edzard Ernst|title=Why Did We Call Prince Charles Foolish and Immoral?|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=2018|volume=42|issue=3|pages=8–9|publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hobbies and personal interests==

===Sports===

From his youth until 1992, Prince Charles was an avid player of competitive [[polo]]. He continued to play informally, including for charity, until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4445424.stm | title = Prince Charles stops playing polo | date = 17 November 2005 |publisher=BBC News | accessdate =29 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles also frequently took part in [[fox hunting]] until [[Hunting Act 2004|the sport was banned in the United Kingdom]] in 2005. By the late 1990s, opposition to the activity was growing when Charles's participation was viewed as a "political statement" by those who were opposed to it. The [[League Against Cruel Sports]] launched an attack against Charles after he took his sons on the [[Duke of Beaufort's Hunt|Beaufort Hunt]] in 1999. At that time, the government was trying to ban hunting with hounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/496138.stm|title=Prince Charles takes sons hunting|date=30 October 1999|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=19 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1055062002|title=Prince: I'll leave Britain over fox hunt ban|date=22 September 2002|work=[[Scotland on Sunday]]|author=Jeremy Watson|accessdate=29 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713090359/http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1055062002|archivedate=13 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Charles is an author of several books that reflect his own interests.

==Media image==
Since his birth, Prince Charles has undergone close media attention, which increased as he matured. It has been an ambivalent relationship, largely impacted by his marriages to Diana and Camilla and its aftermath, but also centred on his future conduct as king, such as the 2014 play ''[[King Charles III (play)|King Charles III]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bartlett|first1=Mike|title=King Charles III|url=http://www.almeida.co.uk/event/kingcharles3|accessdate=27 July 2014|publisher=www.almeida.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of marriage to Diana===
[[File:Prince Charles, Princess Diana, Nancy Reagan, and Ronald Reagan (1985).jpg|thumb|The Prince and Princess of Wales with [[Nancy Reagan]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] in November 1985]]
Described as the "[[Eligible bachelor|world's most eligible bachelor]]" in the late 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Man who will be King|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19791001&amp;id=PSwpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6CoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4563,324963|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423003801/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19791001&amp;id=PSwpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6CoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4563,324963|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 April 2016|accessdate=30 July 2014|agency=Google news|publisher=The Milwaukee Journal|date=1 October 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Charles was subsequently overshadowed by Diana. After her death, the media regularly breached Charles's privacy and printed exposés.

In 2006, the prince filed a court case against the ''[[Daily Mail|Mail on Sunday]]'', after excerpts of his personal journals were published, revealing his opinions on matters such as the [[transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong]] to China in 1997, in which Charles described the Chinese government officials as "appalling old waxworks".&lt;ref name=BBCjournals /&gt; [[Mark Bolland]], his ex-private secretary, declared in a statement to the High Court that Charles "would readily embrace the political aspects of any contentious issue he was interested in&amp;nbsp;... He carried it out in a very considered, thoughtful and researched way. He often referred to himself as a 'dissident' working against the prevailing political consensus."&lt;ref name=BBCjournals&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4734798.stm |title=Charles 'adopted dissident role' |publisher=BBC News |date=21 February 2006 |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Dimbleby]] reported that the prince "has accumulated a number of certainties about the state of the world and does not relish contradiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/prince-charles-ready-for-active-service-23g3jzg02jq|title=Prince Charles: Ready for active service|date= 16 November 2008|work=The Times |location=UK |accessdate=29 March 2009 | first=Jonathan | last=Dimbleby}} {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other people who were formerly connected with the prince have betrayed his confidence. An ex-member of his household handed the press an internal memo in which Charles commented on ambition and opportunity, and which was widely interpreted as blaming meritocracy for creating a combative atmosphere in society. Charles responded: "In my view, it is just as great an achievement to be a plumber or a bricklayer as it is to be a lawyer or a doctor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4035181.stm |title=The rise of the meritocracy |publisher=BBC News |first=Jonathan |last=Duffy |date=23 November 2004 |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction to press treatment===
Charles's anguish was recorded in his private comments to [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]], caught on a microphone during a press photo-call in 2005 and published in the national press. After a question from the [[BBC]]'s royal correspondent, [[Nicholas Witchell]], Charles muttered: "These bloody people. I can't bear that man. I mean, he's so awful, he really is."&lt;ref name="news1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4397667.stm|title=Transcript: Princes' comments|date=31 March 2005|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Charles, "so often a target of the press, got his chance to return fire" when addressing "scores of editors, publishers and other media executives" gathered at [[St Bride's Church|St Bride's Fleet Street]] to celebrate 300 years of journalism.&lt;ref&gt;London's first daily newspaper, the [[Daily Courant]], was published in 1702.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;{{cite web|last=Woods|first=Audrey|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2002/Prince-Charles-Addresses-Editors/id-92deb09f64410b55cdfc261db024282b |title=Prince Charles Addresses Editors |publisher=AP News Archive|date=11 March 2002|accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defending public servants from "the corrosive drip of constant criticism", he noted that the press had been "awkward, cantankerous, cynical, bloody-minded, at times intrusive, at times inaccurate and at times deeply unfair and harmful to individuals and to institutions."&lt;ref name="Woods"/&gt; But, he concluded, regarding his own relations with the press, "from time to time we are probably both a bit hard on each other, exaggerating the downsides and ignoring the good points in each."&lt;ref name="Woods"/&gt;

===Guest appearances on television===
The Prince of Wales has occasionally appeared on television. In 1984, he read his children's book ''[[The Old Man of Lochnagar]]'' for the BBC's ''[[Jackanory]]'' series. The UK soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'' featured an appearance by Charles during the show's 40th anniversary in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=BBC News | title= Prince stars in live soap |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1061585.stm| accessdate=2 October 2012 | date=8 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did the New Zealand young adult cartoon series ''[[bro'Town]]'' (2005), after he attended a performance by the show's creators during a tour of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bro'Town Goes Global|url=https://au.lifestyle.yahoo.com/who/celebrity-interviews/article/-/5922811/bro-town-goes-global/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140501184951/https://au.lifestyle.yahoo.com/who/celebrity-interviews/article/-/5922811/bro-town-goes-global/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 May 2014|publisher=Yahoo|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Dave|title=Prince Charles, The Weather Man: Watch His On-Air Debut For BBC Scotland [VIDEO]|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/prince-charles-weather-man-watch-his-air-debut-bbc-scotland-video-697868|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=IB Times|date=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His saving of the Scottish stately home [[Dumfries House]] was the subject of [[Alan Titchmarsh]]'s documentary ''Royal Restoration'', which aired on TV in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/todays-top-tv/prince-charles-the-royal-restoration/49262 |title=Prince Charles: The Royal Restoration |publisher=What's on TV |date=29 May 2012 |accessdate=17 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123082814/http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/todays-top-tv/prince-charles-the-royal-restoration/49262 |archivedate=23 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in May 2012, Charles tried his hand at being a weather presenter for the BBC, reporting the forecast for Scotland as part of their annual week at [[Holyrood Palace]] alongside [[Christopher Blanchett]]. He injected humour in his report, asking, "Who the hell wrote this script?" as references were made to royal residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/video/2012/may/10/prince-charles-weather-bbc-scotland-video |title=Prince Charles reads weather on BBC Scotland: 'Thank God it isn't a bank holiday!' |work=The Guardian|date=10 May 2012|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2015, ''[[Channel 4 News]]'' revealed that interviews with Charles were subject to a contract that restricts questions to those previously approved, and gives his staff oversight of editing and the right to "remove the contribution in its entirety from the programme". ''Channel 4 News'' decided not to proceed with an interview on this basis, which some journalists believed would put them at risk of breaching the [[Ofcom]] Broadcasting Code on editorial independence and transparency.&lt;ref name="independent-20151202"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/prince-charles-the-15-page-contract-that-reveals-how-the-prince-of-wales-tries-to-control-the-media-a6756541.html |title=Prince Charles: The 15-page contract that reveals how the Prince of Wales tries to control the media |author=Ian Burrell |newspaper=The Independent |date=2 December 2015 |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Residences and finance==
[[File:Clarence house.jpg|thumb|[[Clarence House]], the official residence of the Prince of Wales]]

[[Clarence House]] in London is Charles's official residence. Previously, he had an apartment at [[St James's Palace]]. Charles also has two private homes: [[Highgrove House]] in [[Gloucestershire]] and [[Birkhall]] near [[Balmoral Castle]]. Both Clarence House and Birkhall were previously the residences of [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clarence House |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/ClarenceHouse/History.aspx |publisher=/www.royal.gov.uk |accessdate=1 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502031801/http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/ClarenceHouse/History.aspx |archivedate=2 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His primary source of income is generated from the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], which owns 133,658 acres of land (around 54,090 hectares), including farming, residential, and commercial properties, as well as an investment portfolio.

In 2007, the prince purchased a 192-acre property (150 acres of grazing and parkland, and 40 acres of woodland) in [[Carmarthenshire]], and applied for permission to convert the farm into a Welsh home for him and the Duchess of Cornwall, to be rented out as holiday flats when the couple is not in residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/welsh_property_for_the_duchy_of_cornwall_424937442.html |title=The Prince of Wales&amp;nbsp;– Welsh property for The Duchy of Cornwall |publisher=Prince of Wales |date=22 November 2006 |accessdate=2 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809060116/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/welsh_property_for_the_duchy_of_cornwall_424937442.html |archive-date=9 August 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A neighbouring family said the proposals flouted local planning regulations, and the application was put on hold temporarily while a report was drafted on how the alterations would affect the local bat population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/6727951.stm |title=Objection to prince's house plan |publisher=BBC News |date=7 June 2007 |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles and Camilla first stayed at the new property, called [[Llwynywermod]], in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall inhabit Llwynywermod for first time| publisher=Clarence House| date=23 June 2008| url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/the_prince_of_wales_and_the_duchess_of_cornwall_inhabit_llwy_1566635938.html| accessdate=2 October 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809053130/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/the_prince_of_wales_and_the_duchess_of_cornwall_inhabit_llwy_1566635938.html| archive-date=9 August 2012| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles has held titles throughout his life: the grandson of the monarch, the son of the monarch and in his own right. He has been a [[British prince]] since birth and was created Prince of Wales in 1958.{{refn|group="fn"|As the child of a daughter of the sovereign, Charles would not usually have been accorded the titles of a [[British prince]] or the [[Style (manner of address)|style]] ''[[Royal Highness]]''.

If he uses his first name, he would be known as ''Charles III''. However, it was reported in 2005 that Charles has suggested he may choose to reign as ''George VII'' in honour of his [[George VI|maternal grandfather]], and to avoid association with the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] kings [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (who was beheaded) and [[Charles II of England|Charles&amp;nbsp;II]] (who was known for his promiscuous lifestyle),&lt;ref name="CallMeGeorge"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/call-me-george-suggests-charles-xqqg2th2r23|title=Call me George, suggests Charles|last=Pierce|first=Andrew|date=24 December 2005|work=The Times|location=UK|subscription=yes|via=|accessdate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to be sensitive to the memory of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]], who was called "Charles III" by [[Jacobitism|his supporters]].&lt;ref name="CallMeGeorge"/&gt; Charles's office responded that "no decision has been made".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/dec/27/monarchy.michaelwhite|work=The Guardian |location=UK | title=Charles denies planning to reign as King George | date=27 December 2005| accessdate=2 October 2012 | first=Michael | last=White}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honours and military appointments===
Charles has held substantive ranks in the armed forces of a number of countries since he was made a [[flight lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Air Force]] in 1972. Charles's first honorary appointment in the armed forces was as [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of the [[Royal Regiment of Wales]] in 1969; since then, the prince has also been installed as Colonel-in-Chief, Colonel, Honorary Air Commodore, [[Air Commodore-in-Chief]], Deputy Colonel-in-Chief, Royal Honorary Colonel, Royal Colonel, and Honorary Commodore of at least 32 military formations throughout the Commonwealth, including the [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]], which is the only foreign regiment in the British army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prince of Wales visits the Royal Gurkha Rifles and Knole House|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/news-and-diary/the-prince-of-wales-visits-the-royal-gurkha-rifles-and-knole-house|publisher=Prince of Wales|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009, Charles holds the second-highest ranks in all three branches of the [[Canadian Forces]] and, on 16 June 2012, the Queen awarded the Prince of Wales honorary five-star rank in all three branches of the [[British Armed Forces]], "to acknowledge his support in her role as Commander-in-Chief", installing him as [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]], [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] and [[Marshal of the Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/the_queen_appoints_the_prince_of_wales_to_honorary_five_star_1126275880.html|title=The Queen Appoints the Prince of Wales to Honorary Five-Star rank|publisher=The Prince of Wales website|date=16 June 2012|accessdate=27 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629032823/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/the_queen_appoints_the_prince_of_wales_to_honorary_five_star_1126275880.html|archivedate=29 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-charles/9335960/Prince-Charles-awarded-highest-rank-in-all-three-armed-forces.html |title=Prince Charles awarded highest rank in all three armed forces|work=The Telegraph|date=16 June 2012|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=60350|page=23557|date=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been inducted into seven orders and received eight decorations from the Commonwealth realms, and has been the recipient of 20 different honours from foreign states, as well as nine honorary degrees from universities in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.

===Banners, flags, and standards===
The banners used by the prince vary depending upon location. His Personal Standard is the [[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom]] differenced as in his arms with a label of three points Argent, and the escutcheon of the arms of the Principality of Wales in the centre. It is used outside Wales, Scotland, Cornwall, and Canada, and throughout the entire United Kingdom when the prince is acting in an official capacity associated with the UK Armed Forces.&lt;ref name=flags&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/the-prince-of-wales/titles-and-heraldry/standards|title=Standards |publisher=Prince of Wales|access-date=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The personal flag for use in Wales is based upon the [[Royal Badge of Wales]] (the historic arms of the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]]), which consist of four quadrants, the first and fourth with a red lion on a gold field, and the second and third with a gold lion on a red field. Superimposed is an escutcheon [[Vert (heraldry)|Vert]] bearing the single-arched coronet of the Prince of Wales.&lt;ref name=flags/&gt;

In Scotland the personal banner used since 1974 is based upon three ancient Scottish titles: [[Duke of Rothesay]] ([[heir apparent]] to the [[King of Scots]]), [[High Steward of Scotland]] and [[Lord of the Isles]]. The flag is divided into four quadrants like the arms of the Chief of [[Clan Stewart of Appin]]; the first and fourth quadrants comprise a gold field with a blue and silver checkered band in the centre; the second and third quadrants display a black galley on a silver field. The arms are differenced from those of Appin by the addition of an inescutcheon bearing the tressured lion rampant of Scotland; defaced by a plain label of three points Azure to indicate the heir apparent.&lt;ref name=flags/&gt;

In Cornwall, the banner is the arms of the Duke of Cornwall: "[[Sable (heraldry)|Sable]] fifteen [[bezant]]s Or", that is, a black field bearing fifteen gold coins.&lt;ref name=flags/&gt;

In 2011, the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] introduced a [[Royal standards of Canada#Other members of the Royal Family|personal heraldic banner]] for the Prince of Wales for use in Canada, consisting of the shield of the [[Arms of Canada]] defaced with both a blue [[roundel (heraldry)|roundel]] of the [[Prince of Wales's feathers]] surrounded by a wreath of gold maple leaves, and a white label of three points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=2281 | title=The Prince of Wales | publisher=Office of the Governor General of Canada: Canadian Heraldic Authority | work=Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clarence Francis Stephens''' (July 24, 1917 – March 5, 2018) was the ninth [[African American]] to receive a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in mathematics. He is credited with inspiring students and faculty at [[SUNY Potsdam]] to form the most successful [[United States]] undergraduate mathematics degree programs in the past century.

==Early life==
One of six children, he was orphaned at the age of eight.&lt;ref name="Rountree"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rountree|first1=K|last2=Stanley|first2=O|title=Clarence F. Stephens|url=https://cs.appstate.edu/~sjg/wmm/student/stephens/stephensp.htm|website=cs.appstate.edu|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For his early education, he attended Harbison Agricultural and Industrial Institute, a [[boarding school for African-Americans]] in [[Irmo, South Carolina]] under Dean R. W. Bouleware and later President Rev John G. Porter.

Stephens graduated from [[Johnson C. Smith University]] in 1938 with a B.S. degree in mathematics. He received his M.S. (1939) and his Ph.D. (1944) from the [[University of Michigan]]. He was the 9th [[African American]] to receive a Ph.D in mathematics––for a thesis on ''Non-Linear Difference Equations Analytic in a Parameter'' under James Nyswander.&lt;ref name="Rountree" /&gt;

After serving in the [[U.S. Navy]] (1942–1946) as a Teaching Specialist, Dr. Stephens joined the mathematics faculty of Prairie View A&amp;M University. The next year (1947) he was invited to join the mathematics faculty at [[Morgan State University]].

==From research to teaching==
As a [[Mathematics Association of America]] (MAA) biography explains, “Dr. Stephens' focus was on being a research mathematician, so he accepted the position in part because he would be near a research library at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. While at [[Morgan State University]], Dr. Stephens became appalled at what a poor job was being done in general to teach and inspire students to learn mathematics. He changed his focus from being a researcher to achieving excellence, with desirable results, in teaching mathematics.

In 1953, he received a one-year Ford Fellowship to study at Princeton University's Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.&lt;ref name="Houston 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Houston|first1=JL|title=Clarence Francis Stephens|journal=NAM Newsletter|date=1997|issue=Fall|page=14|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/underrepresented-groups/summa/summa-archival-record/clarence-f-stephens|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Stephens remained at Morgan State until 1962, at which time he accepted an appointment as professor of mathematics at SUNY Geneseo. In 1969 he left Geneseo to join the mathematics faculty at [[SUNY Potsdam]], where he served as chair of the mathematics department until his [[retirement]] in 1987.

The MAA biography reports that during Dr. Stephens’ tenure at SUNY Potsdam "the department became nationally known as a model of teaching excellence in mathematics. For several of these years the program was among the top producers of mathematics majors in the country. The teaching techniques that Professor Stephens introduced at Potsdam, and earlier at Morgan State, have been adopted by many mathematics departments across the country. They have been described in publications by the MAA, and recently in a book, ''Math Education At Its Best: The Potsdam Model,'' by Datta (Center for Teaching/Learning of Mathematics, 1993)."

The '''National Center for Sex Education''' ({{lang-es|Centro Nacional de Educación Sexual}}, '''CENESEX''') is a government-funded body in [[Cuba]]. The center is best known for advocating tolerance of [[LGBT]] issues on the island. CENESEX stresses acceptance of [[sexual diversity]] and has attracted international attention in recent years for its campaigns for the rights of [[transgender]] persons, including the recognition of an individual’s [[gender identity]], regardless of birth sex, and provision of state-funded [[sexual reassignment surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cdn2.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2013/07/10-Anderson.pdf Anderson, Tim. "hiv/aids in cuba: a rights-based analysis." health and human rights (2009): 93-104.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The head of the center is [[Mariela Castro]], daughter of Cuban leader [[Raúl Castro]] (brother of former leader [[Fidel Castro]]).

==Mission==
CENESEX’s mission is to contribute to “the development of a culture of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] that is full, pleasurable and responsible, as well as to promote the full exercise of sexual rights.” The center plays a primary role in education concerning contraception and [[AIDS]].

==State-funded sexual reassignment==
The center pushed for passage of a law that would provide [[transgender]] persons with free [[sex reassignment surgery]] and [[Hormone replacement therapy (trans)|hormone replacement therapy]] in addition to granting them new legal identification documents with their changed gender. A draft bill was presented to the Cuban parliament in 2005. Prior to being approved, it was suggested that the bill would make Cuba the most [[Liberalism|liberal]] nation in [[Latin America]] on [[gender]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, Esteban, [http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000021/002197.htm "Castro's niece fights for new revolution"], ''[[Reuters]]'', 2006-07-03&lt;/ref&gt;  The measure passed in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN06395397|title=Cuba approves sex change operations|publisher=Reuters|date=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''Darwin for Beginners''''', republished as '''''Introducing Darwin''''', is a 1982 [[graphic novel|graphic]] [[study guide]] to [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Evolution]] written by Dr. [[Jonathan Miller]] and illustrated by [[Borin Van Loon]].&lt;ref name="RW00"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Jonathan|last1=Miller|first2=Borin|last2=Van Loon|year=1982|title=Darwin for Beginners|publisher=[[For Beginners, LLC|Writers &amp; Readers Publishing]]|location=|page=|chapter=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volume, according to the publisher's website, "unravels Darwin’s life and his contribution to biology, and traces the path from his scientific predecessors to the later modifications that his own evolutionary theories required."&lt;ref name="IB01"&gt;{{cite web |title=Introducing Darwin: A Graphic Guide |first= |last= |url=http://www.introducingbooks.com/title/introducing-darwin/ |work=Icon Books |date= |accessdate=2017-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication History==
This volume was originally published in the UK by [[For Beginners, LLC|Writers and Readers Publishing Cooperative]] in 1982, following the collapse of this organisation in 1984, in part due to a disagreement over the selling off of the US rights to this title, the book has subsequently been republished in the US by [[Pantheon Books]] and in the UK by [[Introducing... book series|Icon Books]].

Work on the book proved difficult at times, according to illustrator Borin Van Loon, as the schedule of the author Jonathan Miller was, "always taken up with ''lighting Rigoletto'' at the [[Royal Opera House]] or making a television series on the human body.&lt;ref name="BVL01"&gt;{{cite web |title=Introducing Darwin: A Graphic Guide |first=Borin |last=Van Loon |url=http://www.borinvanloon.co.uk/loonintrodarwin.html |work=borinvanloon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Professor [[David B. Richman]], writing in ''[[Reports of the National Center for Science Education]]'', described the book as, "a rather charming graphic account of Darwin's ideas."&lt;ref name="RNCSE01"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Richman |first=David B. |date=September–October 2010 |title=Review: Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species |url=https://ncse.com/library-resource/review-charles-darwins-origin-species |journal=[[Reports of the National Center for Science Education]] |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=38–39|doi=|access-date=2017-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Professor [[Richard C. Lewontin]], writing in ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', describes the book as, "a superb introduction to a very tricky subject."&lt;ref name="NYRB01"&gt;{{cite web |title=Darwin’s Revolution |first=Richard C. |last=Lewontin |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1983/06/16/darwins-revolution/ |work=[[New York Review of Books]] |date=1983-06-16 |accessdate=2017-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reviewer Charles Solomon, however, dismisses it as, "a competent but by no means extraordinary biography."&lt;ref name="LAT01"&gt;{{cite web |title=Darwin for Beginners |first=Charles |last=Solomon |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-25/books/bk-2024_1_jonathan-miller |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1990-02-25 |accessdate=2017-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Jon Seger]], writing in ''[[New Scientist]]'', describes the style of author Jonathan Miller, who he point out is primarily known as a TV physician, as, "that of a television documentary."&lt;ref name="NS01"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seger |first=Jon |date=9 June 1983 |title=Sanitary and Not So Sanitary Evolution |journal=[[New Scientist]] |volume=98 |issue=1361 |pages=719 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Miller's text is, according to Lewontin, "historically correct, scientifically impeccable," with, "all the emphasis in the right place."&lt;ref name="NYRB01" /&gt;

Van Loon's illustrations are,  according to Lewontin, "a constant reminder not to take the life of the mind more seriously than it deserves."&lt;ref name="NYRB01" /&gt; Seger describes, "the stream of rapidly changing images," as, "full of action," although at times, "pointlessly vulgar."&lt;ref name="NS01" /&gt;

Miller and Van Loon have, concludes Seger, "not produced a work of scholarship," but have, "brought to life an important chapter of scientific history."&lt;ref name="NS01" /&gt;

'''Deborah Digges''' (February 6, 1950 – April 10, 2009) was an American [[poet]] and teacher.

==Biography==
She was born Deborah Leah Sugarbaker in [[Jefferson City, Missouri]], on February 6, 1950.  Her father was a physician and her mother was a nurse; she was the sixth child in a family of ten children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Fox | first = Margali | title = Deborah Digges, Poet Who Channeled, Dies at 59 | series = Arts  | work=[[The New York Times]] | date = 2009-04-16 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/arts/17digges.html | accessdate = 2009-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digges received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from the [[University of California, Riverside]] in 1976, a [[Masters degree|Masters]] from the [[University of Missouri]] in 1982, and her [[Master of Fine Arts]] in Poetry from the [[Iowa Writers Workshop]] in 1984.  In the course of her academic career, she taught in the writing and English faculties of [[New York University]], [[Boston University]], [[Columbia University]], and [[Tufts University]].

She authored four books of poetry and two memoirs.  Her first book of poems, ''Vesper Sparrows'', won the [[Delmore Schwartz]] Memorial Prize for Poetry.  In 1997 Digges was awarded the [[Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award]], the largest prize for a single work of poetry, for her book ''Rough Music''.&lt;ref name=Lederman2009&gt;{{cite web

'''Educational research''' refers to the systematic collection and analysis of data related to the field of education. Research may involve a variety of methods.&lt;ref name="lodico"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Marguerite G. |last1=Lodico |first2=Dean T. |last2=Spaulding |first3=Katherine H. |last3=Voegtle |title=Methods in Educational Research: From Theory to Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J-aNet5eEFoC |year=2010 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] |isbn=978-0-470-58869-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Garry |last1=Anderson |first2=Nancy |last2=Arsenault |title=Fundamentals of Educational Research |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t85N0Ka1nq8C |year=1998 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-203-97822-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yates"&gt;{{cite book |first=Lyn |last=Yates |title=What Does Good Educational Research Look Like?: Situating a Field and Its Practices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=auAas53WSt0C&amp;pg=PP1 |year=2004 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill International]] |isbn=978-0-335-21199-9 |series=Conducting Educational Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research may involve various aspects of education including student learning, [[teaching methods]], teacher training, and classroom dynamics.&lt;ref name="texas"&gt;{{cite web |title=IAR: Glossary. (n.d.) |date=21 September 2011 |work=Instructional Assessment Resources |publisher=[[University of Texas at Austin]] |url=http://www.utexas.edu/academic/ctl/assessment/iar/glossary.php}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational researchers generally agree that research should be rigorous and systematic.&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="texas" /&gt; However, there is less agreement about specific standards, criteria and research procedures.&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kincheloe"&gt;{{cite book |first=Joe |last=Kincheloe |title=Rigour and Complexity in Educational Research |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khliqOuJrLIC |year=2004 |publisher=McGraw-Hill International |isbn=978-0-335-22604-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Educational researchers may draw upon a variety of disciplines. These disciplines include [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yates" /&gt; Methods may be drawn from a range of disciplines.&lt;ref name="yates" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kincheloe" /&gt; Conclusions drawn from an individual research study may be limited by the characteristics of the participants who were studied and the conditions under which the study was conducted.&lt;ref name="yates" /&gt;

==Characteristics of educational research==

There is no single "correct" way of conducting research in the field of education. 

Gary Anderson outlined ten aspects of educational research:&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt;

* Educational research attempts to solve a problem.
* Research involves gathering new data from primary or first-hand sources or using existing data for a new purpose.
* Research is based upon observable experience or empirical evidence.
* Research demands accurate observation and description.
* Research generally employs carefully designed procedures and rigorous analysis.
* Research emphasizes the development of generalizations, principles or theories that will help in understanding, prediction and/or control.
* Research requires expertise—familiarity with the field; competence in methodology; technical skill in collecting and analyzing the data.
* Research attempts to find an objective, unbiased solution to the problem and takes great pains to validate the procedures employed.
* Research is a deliberate and unhurried activity which is directional but often refines the problem or questions as the research progresses.
* Research is carefully recorded and reported to other persons interested in the problem.

==Approaches==
There are different approaches to educational research. One is a basic approach.&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt; This approach is also referred to as an academic research approach.&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt; Another approach is applied research&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt; or a contract research approach.&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt; These approaches have different purposes which influence the nature of the respective research.

===Basic approach===
Basic, or academic research focuses on the search for truth&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt; or the development of educational [[theory]].&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt; Researchers with this background "design studies that can test, refine, modify, or develop theories".&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt; Generally, these researchers are affiliated with an academic institution and are performing this research as part of their graduate or doctoral work.

===Applied approach===
The pursuit of information that can be directly applied to practice is aptly known as applied or contractual research.&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt; Researchers in this field are trying to find solutions to existing educational problems. The approach is much more utilitarian as it strives to find information that will directly influence practice.&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt;  Applied researchers are commissioned by a sponsor and are responsible for addressing the needs presented by this employer.&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt; The goal of this research is "to determine the applicability of educational theory and principles by testing hypotheses within specific settings".&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt;

===Comparison of basic and applied research===
The following are several defining characteristics that were written by Gary Anderson to compare basic (academic) and applied (contract) research.&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! Basic (Academic) Research !! Applied (Contract) Research
|-
                       
|1 ||Is sponsored by an agency committed to the general advancement of knowledge.|| Is sponsored by an agency with a vested interest in the results.
|-                        
|2 || Results are the property of society and the research community.|| Results become the property of the sponsor.
|-                        
|3 || Studies rely on the established reputations of the researchers and are totally under their control.|| Studies follow explicit terms of reference developed by the sponsor to serve the sponsor's needs.
|-                        
|4 || Budget allocations are generally based on global proposals and accounting is left to the researchers.||Budget accountability is directly related to the sponsor and relates to agreed terms of reference, time frames and methodologies.
|-                        
|5 ||The conduct of research is based on 'good faith' between funder and researcher.|| The work is contractual between sponsor and researcher.
|-                        
|6 ||The research produces findings and conclusions, but rarely recommendations except those related to further research needs.|| The research includes applied recommendations for action.
|-                        
|7 ||Academic research tends to extend an identifiable scholarly discipline.|| By its nature, contract research tends to be interdisciplinary.
|-                        
|8 ||Academic research is typically focused on a single set of testable hypotheses.|| Contract research frequently analyzes the consequences of alternative policy options.	
|-                        
|9 ||Decision-rules relate to theoretically-based tests of statistical significance.|| Decision-rules relate to predetermined conventions and agreements between the sponsor and the researcher.	
|-                        
|10 ||Research reports are targeted to other specialized researchers in the same field.|| Research reports are intended to be read and understood by lay persons.
|}

==Methodology==
The basis for educational research is the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt; The scientific method uses directed questions and manipulation of [[Variable (research)|variables]] to systematically find information about the teaching and learning process.&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt; In this scenario questions are answered by the analysis of data that is collected specifically for the purpose of answering these questions.&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt; Hypotheses are written and subsequently proved or disproved by data which leads to the creation of new [[hypotheses]]. The two main types of data that are used under this method are [[Qualitative data|qualitative]] and [[quantitative research|quantitative]].&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kincheloe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;{{cite book |first1=David |last1=Scott |first2=Robin |last2=Usher |title=Understanding Educational Research |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cErS8xH7bZYC |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-203-13192-3 |origyear=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qualitative research===
[[Qualitative research]] uses the data which is descriptive in nature. Tools that educational researchers use in collecting qualitative data include: observations, conducting interviews, conducting document analysis, and analyzing participant products such as journals, diaries, images or blogs.&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt;

===Types of qualitative research===
* [[Case study]]&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt;&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt;
* [[Ethnography]]&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt;&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt; 
* [[Phenomenological research]]&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt;&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt; 
* [[Narrative research]]&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt;
* Historical research&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt;

===Quantitative research===
[[Quantitative research]] uses data that is numerical and is based on the assumption that the numbers will describe a single reality.&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt; Statistics are often applied to find relationships between variables.

===Types of quantitative research===
* Descriptive survey research&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt;
* Experimental research&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt;
* Single-subject research&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt;
* Causal-comparative research&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt;
* Correlational research&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt;&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt;
* [[Meta-analysis]]&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt;

===Combination methods===
There also exists a new school of thought that these derivatives of the scientific method are far too reductionistic in nature.&lt;ref name="kincheloe" /&gt; Since educational research includes other disciplines such as [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[science]], and [[philosophy]]&lt;ref name="lodico" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yates" /&gt; and refers to work done in a wide variety of contexts&lt;ref name="yates" /&gt; it is proposed that researchers should use "multiple research approaches and theoretical constructs."&lt;ref name="kincheloe" /&gt;  This could mean using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods as well as common methodology from the fields mentioned above. In [[social research]] this phenomenon is referred to as [[triangulation (social science)]].&lt;ref name="gorard"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Stephen |last1=Gorard |first2=Chris |last2=Taylor |title=Combining Methods in Educational and Social Research |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jy1sbkAGfCoC |year=2004 |publisher=McGraw-Hill International |isbn=978-0-335-22517-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is well summarized by the work of Barrow in his text An introduction to philosophy of education:

{{Quote|Since educational issues are of many different kinds and logical types, it is to be expected that quite different types of research should be brought into play on different occasions. The question therefore is not whether research into teaching should be conducted by means of quantitative measures (on some such grounds as that they are more 'objective') or qualitative measures (on some such grounds as that they are more 'insightful'), but what kind of research can sensibly be utilized to look into this particular aspect of teaching as opposed to that.&lt;ref name="barrow"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ronald |last1=Woods |first2=Robin |last2=Barrow |title=An Introduction to Philosophy of Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ioOXDSw37jAC |year=2006 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-203-96995-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2776">'''Emmanuel Nicholas''' is a [[Sri Lankan Tamil]], who was born in [[Sri Lanka]] on 2 January 1939.&lt;ref name=cv&gt;[http://dawn.com/2012/04/13/the-sri-lankan-who-taught-gilani-and-worked-for-the-poor/ Dawn 13 April 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas, a [[La Salle Brothers, Pakistan|De La Salle Christian Brother]], was 27 when he left Sri Lanka for Pakistan, to teach mathematics and science at [[La Salle High School Multan]]. He taught there until 1968. His students included [[Yousuf Raza Gillani]] who become prime minister of Pakistan in March 2008.&lt;ref name=cv /&gt;

As a De La Salle Brother, he considers his mission in life is to educate the poor in the slums and rural outbacks. When St. Vincent’s school, in [[Mian Channu]] on the Multan-Lahore road, wanted a principal in 1968, Nicholas volunteered for the job. Mian Channu was a Christian village of about 600 families and the school was built for their children.

Nicholas also considered former President [[Zia ul-Haq]] to be a close friend.&lt;ref name=cv /&gt;

He also attended [[Fordham University]] in New York City, where he earned a master's degree in counseling.&lt;ref name=times&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/mar/19/20040319-093912-9052r/#ixzz38mUhKdrP Washington Times March 19, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, he left Pakistan to return to his native Sri Lanka. 
The President of Pakistan conferred the civil award of [[Tamgha-e-Imtiaz]] (Medal of Pakistan) on Bro. Emmanuel in recognition of his outstanding and meritorious services for the education sector in Pakistan. He received the award at the High Commission of Pakistan, [[Colombo]], on 23 March 2012.&lt;ref name=cv /&gt;

Back in Sri Lanka, he is working to improve the quality of life in a shantytown on the outskirts of [[Colombo]], particularly to reduce maternal and infant deaths. The De La Salle Brothers care for 450 children from ages 3 to 5 in preschool programs, 135 young women in training for jobs like sewing and catering, and 175 young men learning trades like agriculture and auto mechanics. Raising funds to carry out these programs is not easy. They get little financial help from the government, but people in business and international foundations do support . He needs $8,000 each month to continue his work.&lt;ref name=times /&gt;

}}The '''European Foundation for Management Development''' ('''EFMD''') is an international not-for-profit association, based in Brussels, Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=L'European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD)|url=http://www.groupeiam.com/index.php/accueil-efmd/72-international/organismes-internationaux-de-labellisation/100-l-european-foundation-for-management-development-efmd|journal=http://www.groupeiam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europe's largest network association in the field of management development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mba-courses.com/efmd.htm |title=European Foundation for Management Development: EQUIS Accreditation: A Level of Quality |work=MBA Courses Worldwide |publisher=Sandringham Publishing Ltd |accessdate=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has over 890 member organizations from [[academia]], business, public service and consultancy in 88 countries (as of September 2017). EFMD provides a forum for networking in [[management development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=European Foundation for Management Development|url=http://10times.com/organizers/european-foundation-for-management-development-efmd|journal=http://10times.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EFMD operates the '''EFMD Quality Improvement System''' ([[EFMD Quality Improvement System|EQUIS]]), which is one of the leading international systems of quality assessment, improvement, and accreditation of higher education institutions in management and business administration. It is comparable to its American equivalent [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] and provides a forum for information, research, networking and debate on innovation and best practice in management development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Hayleys case study by INSEAD wins top award in Europe |location=Sri Lanka |newspaper=[[The Daily Mirror (Sri Lanka)|The Daily Mirror]] |date=3 June 2010 |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/print/index.php/business/127-local/12150.html |accessdate=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation also runs the EPAS accreditation system for programmes as well as the EFMD Deans Across Frontiers development programme (EDAF) and the Business School Impact System (BSIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD)|url=http://www.unprme.org/about-prme/governance/efmd.php|journal=http://www.unprme.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Types of accreditation ==

While the [[EQUIS]] accreditation process, which is valid for an entire school (or faculty), is the main type of accreditation EFMD offers, there are a variety of other accreditations available. With EPAS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= EPAS Accreditation EFMD Programme accreditation System (EPAS) |url=http://www.efmd.org/index.php/services-for-business-schools/epas-accreditation |accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible for business schools to have certain degree programs accredited rather than the entire school. This variant somewhat resembles the AMBA ([[Association of MBAs]]) accreditation, as the London-based Association accredits the school's entire portfolio of [[MBA]] programs, but does not accredit the entire business school. EFMD also offers an accreditation for online courses (EOCCS) and for corporate learning (CLIP).

== Triple Accreditation ==

In business and management education, acquiring multiple accreditation by [[EQUIS]], [[AACSB]] and [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]] is often considered the "gold standard" because a business school must go to through a rigorous certification process by each of the three accreditation bodies. Schools that acquire all three are often referred to as having a [[Triple accreditation]] or Triple Crown accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Grandes écoles: les labels enfin décryptés|url=http://etudiant.aujourdhui.fr/etudiant/info/labels-accreditations-grandes-ecoles-enfin-decryptes.html|journal=http://etudiant.aujourdhui.fr|date = 13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EFMD activities ==

EFMD is the European partner in the [[China Europe International Business School]] ([[CEIBS]]), a joint venture with [[Shanghai Jiaotong University]] established as the first international business school with autonomous status in 1994 under an agreement between the [[European Commission]] and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Global Initiatives |url=http://www.efmd.org/images/stories/efmd/downloadables/EFMD_About_EFMD_Update_2011_ONLINE.pdf |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
EFMD is also founding partner of the Global Foundation for Management Education (GFME), which is a joint venture with the US-based Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business ([[AACSB]] International).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Global Initiatives |url=http://www.efmd.org/images/stories/efmd/downloadables/EFMD_About_EFMD_Update_2011_ONLINE.pdf |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; EFMD organizes conferences and seminars around the world for management development industry and published the [http://globalfocusmagazine.com Global Focus magazine].

In 2009, EFMD received an EU grant worth €2.2m&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 2009 Annual Action Programme for Non-State Actors and Local Authorities in Development |url=http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/documents/aap/2009/af_aap_2009_dci-nsa_p2.pdf |accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a project that aims to improve the efficiency of Cuban companies by providing training to senior managers. This project, called '''Consolidating and Strengthening Cuban Managerial Capabilities''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Consolidating and Strengthening Cuban Managerial Capabilities |url=http://www.efmd.org/index.php/international-projects/current-projects/cuba-project |accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to be implemented under the leadership of EFMD together with [[ESADE]], a business school in Barcelona, and the Cuban Ministry of Higher Education.

'''Heinrich Panofka''' (3 October 1807 – 18 November 1887)&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.bnf.fr/14825870/heinrich_panofka/ Heinrich Panofka] data.bnf.ft. Retrieved 8 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; was a German violinist, voice teacher, writer on music and composer.

==Life==
Panofka was born in Breslau (present-day [[Wrocław]]) in 1807. As a child, he made rapid progress on the violin, and first performed in public aged ten. In 1824 he went to Breslau University to study law, according to the wishes of his father; afterward, following his own wishes, he went to Vienna where he was a student of the violinist [[Joseph Mayseder]].&lt;ref name=dmm&gt;{{Cite Grove1900|first=George|last=Grove|wstitle=Panofka, Heinrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{cite wikisource|wslanguage=de|title=ADB:Panofka, Heinrich|year=1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1827 he performed successfully in Vienna and tried to follow up his success by traveling to Munich and Berlin. On the death of his father in 1831 he received his inheritance. Although in the following year he was persuaded by pianist Wenzeslaus Hauck to go on a concert tour through Germany, he gave up touring in 1833.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

In 1834 Panofka settled in Paris; here he met the singing teacher [[Marco Bordogni]], and other singers including [[Giovanni Battista Rubini]], [[Luigi Lablache]] and [[Domenico Donzelli]]. He became interested in the training of the voice, and with Bordogni he founded in 1842 an ''Académie de chant''.&lt;ref name=dmm/&gt;&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

He moved to London in 1844, and in 1847 was engaged by [[Benjamin Lumley]] as one of his assistants at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]]. He became known as a teacher and published ''A Practical Singing Tutor'' and other vocal studies. He returned to Paris in 1852; about 1855 he published ''L'art de chanter''. It was translated into Italian and German, and was much discussed before it gained acceptance from musical institutes.&lt;ref name=dmm/&gt;&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

From 1866 Panofka lived in Florence;&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; he died in 1887.&lt;ref name=dmm/&gt;

==Works==
Other works by Panofka include compositions for violin and piano, and for violin and orchestra. He translated [[Pierre Baillot]]'s ''L'art du violon'' into German.&lt;ref name=dmm/&gt; Interested in the musical issues of the day, he contributed to Robert Schumann's magazine ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]''.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

Through history, the systems of economic support for scientists and their work have been important determinants of the character and pace of scientific research.  The ancient foundations of the sciences were driven by practical and religious concerns and or the pursuit of philosophy more generally.  From the Middle Ages until the [[Age of Enlightenment]], scholars sought various forms of [[nobility|noble]] and [[religion|religious]] [[patronage]] or funded their own work through medical practice.  In the 18th and 19th centuries, many disciplines began to professionalize, and both government-sponsored "prizes" and the first research professorships at universities drove scientific investigation.  In the 20th century, a variety of sources, including government organizations, [[military funding of science|military funding]], [[patent]] profits, corporate sponsorship, and private [[philanthropy|philanthropies]], have shaped scientific research.

==Ancient science==
{{See also|History of mathematics|History of astronomy}}

Most early advances in mathematics, astronomy and engineering were byproducts of more immediate and practical goals.  [[Surveying]] and [[accounting]] needs drove ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Chinese, and Indian mathematics, while calendars created for religious and agricultural purposes drove early astronomy.

Modern science owes much of its heritage to ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]]; influential work in astronomy, mechanics, geometry, medicine, and [[natural history]] was part of the general pursuit of philosophy.  Architectural knowledge, especially in ancient Greece and Rome, also contributed to the development of mathematics, though the extent of the connection between architectural knowledge and more abstract mathematics and mechanics is unclear.

[[State (polity)|State]] [[policy]] has influenced the funding of [[public works]] and science for thousands of years, dating at least from the time of the [[Mohists]], who inspired the study of logic  during the period of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]], and the study of defensive fortifications during the [[Warring States period]] in China. General levies of labor and grain were collected to fund great public works in China, including the accumulation of grain for distribution in times of famine,&lt;ref&gt;Francesca Bray (1984), ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'' '''VI.2''' '''''Agriculture'''''&lt;/ref&gt; for the building of levees to control flooding by the great rivers of China, for the building of canals and locks to connect rivers of China, some of which flowed in opposite directions to each other,&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Needham]], ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and for  the building of bridges across these rivers. These projects required a [[civil service]], the [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholars]], some of whom demonstrated great mastery of [[hydraulics]].

==Science policy in the Middle Ages==
{{Main|Science in the Middle Ages}}

[[H. Floris Cohen]]'s historiography of the scientific revolution (''How Modern Science Came into the World'') credits the [[Umayyad caliphate]]s and especially the [[Abbasid caliphate]]s support for the [[Translation Movement|translation movement]] from the Greek, Persian, and Syriac literature to Arabic. These translations were undertaken by the library of the [[House of Wisdom]] in [[Bagdhad]].  [[Al-Kindi]], [[Al-Battani]], [[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]] and [[Ibn al-Haytham]] flourished under the liberal policies of these caliphates.

==Arabic-language science policy==
{{See also|Science in medieval Islam}}
Science in the Islamic world during the Middle Ages followed various models, and modes of funding varied based primarily on scholars. It was extensive patronage and strong intellectual policies implemented by specific rulers that allowed scientific knowledge to develop in many areas. The most prominent example of this is with the Translation Movement of the ninth century that was facilitated by early [[Abbasid]] Caliphs.&lt;ref&gt;Abattouy, M., Renn, J. &amp; Weinig, P., 2001. Transmission as Transformation: The Translation Movements in the Medieval East and West in a Comparative Perspective. Science in Context, 14(1-2), 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;   Other wealthy patrons also supported this movement and accelerated the process of acquiring, translating and interpreting ancient works of philosophy and science. Funding for translation was ongoing throughout the reign of certain caliphs, and it turned out that certain scholars became experts in the works they translated and in turn received further support for continuing to develop certain sciences. As these sciences received wider attention from the elite, more scholars were invited and funded to study particular sciences. Examples of translators and scholars who benefited from this type of support were [[al-Khawarizmi]], [[Hunayn Ibn Ishaq]] and the [[Banu Musa]].&lt;ref&gt;2004. Centuries in the House of Wisdom | Education | The Guardian. Available at: https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/sep/23/research.highereducation1 [Accessed March 8, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;  Patronage was primarily allocated to practical sciences which would be beneficial to the society at the time. Funding was reserved for those who were well versed in certain disciplines, and was not given based on religious affiliation. For this reason we find Jewish, Christian and mixed Muslim scholars working in [[Baghdad]] and other locations, often with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sabra | first1 = A.I. | year = 1996 | title = Situating Arabic Science: Locality versus Essence | url = | journal = Isis | volume = 87 | issue = 4| pages = 654–670 | doi = 10.1086/357651 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable feature  of many scholars working under Muslim rule in medieval times is that they were often polymaths. Examples include the work on [[Optics]], [[Math]] and [[Astronomy]] of [[Ibn al-Haytham]], or the work on [[Biology]], [[Theology]] and [[Arabic literature]] of [[al-Jahiz]]. Many of these scholars were encouraged through patronage to take a multidisciplinary approach to their work and to dabble in multiple fields. Those individuals who were knowledgeable on a wide variety of subjects, especially practical topics, were respected and well-cared for in their societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rashed | first1 = R. | year = 2002 | title = PORTRAITS OF SCIENCE: A Polymath in the 10th Century | url = | journal = Science | volume = 297 | issue = 5582| page = 773 |doi=10.1126/science.1074591 | pmid=12161634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding of science existed in many Muslim empires outside the Abbasids and continued even after the Mongol invasions into the Middle East. Results of patronage in Medieval Islamic areas include the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, the [[Al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]], [[Bimaristans]] across the Middle East and Persia, and famous observatories, such at that of [[Ulugh Beg]] in [[Samarqand]]. It is also significant to note that later Muslim empires (Ottomans, Safavid, Mughal empires) also supported science in their own ways, even though there scientific achievements were not as prominent on a global level.&lt;ref&gt;O'Leary, D.L., 1952. The Early Westward Drift of Science and Philosophy. Philosophy East and West, 1(4), 53-58.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FRANCIS ROBINSON, OTTOMANS-SAFAVIDS-MUGHALS: SHARED KNOWLEDGE AND CONNECTIVE SYSTEMS. Journal of Islamic Studies 1997 8: 151-184&lt;/ref&gt;

==16th and 17th centuries==

In Italy, Galileo noted that individual taxation of minute amounts could fund large sums to the State, which could then fund his research on the trajectory of cannonballs, noting that "each individual soldier was being paid from coin collected by a general tax of pennies and farthings, while even a million of gold would not suffice to pay the entire army."&lt;ref&gt;[[Galileo]] (1638) [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=753&amp;chapter=109891&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 Two New Sciences], Salviati, first day of the dialogs&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain]], [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]] had a formative effect on science policy with his identification of "experiments of .. light, more penetrating into nature [than what others know]",&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir Francis Bacon]] (1624). ''[[New Atlantis]]''&lt;/ref&gt; which today we call the [[crucial experiment]].  Governmental approval of [[the Royal Society]] recognized a [[scientific community]] which exists to this day. British prizes for research spurred the development of an accurate, portable [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]], which directly enabled reliable navigation and sailing on the high seas, and also funded Babbage's computer.

===Patronage===
Most of the important astronomers and natural philosophers (as well as artists) in the 16th and 17th centuries depended on the [[patronage]] of powerful religious or political figures to fund their work.  Patronage networks extended all the way from [[Emperor]]s and [[Pope]]s to regional nobles to artisans to peasants; even university positions were based to some extent on patronage.  Scholarly careers in this period were driven by patronage, often starting in undistinguished universities or local schools or courts, and traveling closer or farther from centers of power as their fortunes rose and fell.

Patronage, and the desire for more, also shaped the work and publications of scientists.  Effusive dedications to current or potential patrons can be found in almost every scholarly publication, while the interests of a patron in a specific topic was a strong incentive to pursue said topic&amp;mdash;or reframe one's work in terms of it.  [[Galileo]], for example, first presented the [[telescope]] as a naval instrument to military- and commerce-focused [[Republic of Venice]]; when he sought the more prestigious patronage of the [[Medici]] court in [[Florence]], he instead promoted the astronomical potential of the device (by naming the [[Galilean moons|moons of Jupiter]] after the Medicis).

A scholar's patron not only supported his research financially, but also provided credibility by associating results with the authority of the patron.  This function of patronage was gradually subsumed by scientific societies, which also initially drew upon their royal charters for authority but eventually came to be sources of credibility on their own.

===Self-funded science===

Self-funding and independent wealth were also crucial funding sources for scientists, from the Renaissance at least until the late 19th century.  Many scientists derived income from tangential but related activities: Galileo sold instruments; [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] published horoscopes; [[Robert Hooke]] designed buildings and built watches; and most anatomists and natural historians practiced or taught medicine. Those with independent means were sometimes known as [[gentlemen scientists]].

===Exploration and commerce===

Military and commercial voyages, though not intended for scientific purposes, were especially important for the dramatic growth of natural historical knowledge during the "[[Age of Exploration]]."  Scholars and nobles in seafaring nations, first Spain and Portugal followed Italy, France and England, amassed unprecedented collections of biological specimens in [[cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]], which galvanized interest in diversity and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]].

==18th and 19th centuries==
Gradually, a science policy arose that ideas be as free as the air (air being a [[free good]], not just a [[public good]]). Steven Johnson, in ''The invention of air'' (a 2008 book on Enlightenment Europe and America, especially on [[Joseph Priestley]]) quotes Jefferson: "That ideas should spread freely from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, ... like the air ... incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation." &lt;ref&gt;p.xiii Steven Johnson (2008) ''The invention of air'' {{ISBN|978-1-59448-401-8}}  (with acknowledgement on p.241, that Johnson learned the Jefferson quotation from [[Lawrence Lessig]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as the pace of technological progress increased before and during the [[industrial revolution]], most scientific and technological research was carried out by individual [[inventor]]s using their own funds. For example, Joseph Priestley was a clergyman and educator, who spoke freely with others, especially those in his scientific community, including [[Benjamin Franklin]], a self-made man who retired from the printing business. A system of [[patent]]s was developed to allow inventors a period of time (often twenty years) to commercialise their inventions and recoup a profit, although in practice many found this difficult. The talents of an inventor are not those of a businessman, and there are many examples of inventors (e.g. [[Charles Goodyear]]) making rather little money from their work whilst others were able to market it.

===Scientific societies===

The professionalization of science, begun in the nineteenth century, was further enabled by the creation of scientific organizations such as the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1863, the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] in 1911, and state funding of universities of their respective nations.

===Professionalization===

===Industry===

===Research universities===

==1900&amp;ndash;1945==

In the twentieth century, scientific and technological research became increasingly systematised, as [[corporation]]s developed, and discovered that continuous investment in [[research and development]] could be a key element of success in a competitive strategy. It remained the case, however, that imitation by competitors&amp;nbsp;– circumventing or simply flouting patents, especially those registered abroad&amp;nbsp;– was often just as successful a strategy for companies focused on innovation in matters of organisation and production technique, or even in marketing. A classic example is that of [[Wilkinson Sword]] and [[Global Gillette|Gillette]] in the [[disposable razor]] market, where the former has typically had the technological edge, and the latter the commercial one.

Swedish industrialist [[Alfred Nobel]]'s will directed that his vast fortune be utilized to establish prizes in the scientific fields of medicine, physics and chemistry as well as literature and peace. The [[Nobel prize]] served to provide financial incentives for scientists, elevated leading scientists to unprecedented visibility, and provided an example for other philanthropists of the industrial era to provide private sources of funding for scientific research and education. Ironically, it was not an era of peace that followed, but rather wars fought on unprecedented international scale that led to expanded state interest in the funding of science.

===War research===
The desire for more advanced weapons during [[World War I]] inspired significant investments in scientific research and applied engineering in both Germany and allied countries. [[World War II]] spawned even more widespread scientific research and engineering development in such fields as nuclear chemistry and nuclear physics as scientists raced to contribute to the development of radar, the proximity fuse, and the atomic bomb. In Germany, scientists such as [[Werner Heisenberg]] were being pushed by the leaders of the German war effort, including [[Adolf Hitler]] to evaluate the feasibility of developing atomic weapons in time for them to have an effect on the outcome of the war. Meanwhile, allied countries in the late 1930s and 1940s committed monumental resources to wartime scientific research. In the United States, these efforts were initially led by the National Defense Research Committee. Later, the Office of Scientific Research and Development, organized and administered by the MIT engineer [[Vannevar Bush]], took up the effort of coordinating government efforts in support of science.

Following the United States entry into the second world war, the [[Manhattan Project]] emerged as a massive coordinated program to pursue development of [[nuclear weapons]]. Leading scientists such as [[Robert Oppenheimer]], [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Edward Teller]] were among the thousands of civilian scientists and engineers employed in the unprecedented wartime efforts. Entire communities were created to support the scientific and industrial aspects of the nuclear efforts in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]]; [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]]; the [[Hanford site]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and elsewhere.  The Manhattan Project cost $1,889,604,000 of which $69,681,000 was dedicated to research and development. The Manhattan Project is regarded as a major milestone in the trend towards government funding of [[big science]].

==1945&amp;ndash;2000==

===Cold War science policy===

In the [[United States]], the foundation for post-WWII science policy was laid out in [[Vannevar Bush]]'s ''Science&amp;nbsp;– the Endless Frontier'', submitted to President Truman in 1945. Vannevar Bush was President Roosevelt's science advisor and became one of the most influential science advisors as in his essay, he pioneered how we decide on science policy today.&lt;ref name="Ehlers_science"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehlers|first=Vernon|title=The Future of U.S. Science Policy|journal=Science|date=16 January 1998|volume=279|pages=302|doi=10.1126/science.279.5349.302a|issue=5349|bibcode = 1998Sci...279..302E }}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 September 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Vannevar Bush, director of the office of scientific research and development for the U.S. government, wrote in July 1945 that "science is a proper concern of government" &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm Vannevar Bush (July 1945), "Science, the Endless Frontier"]&lt;/ref&gt;  This report led to the creation of the [[National Science Foundation]] in 1950 to support civilian scientific research.

During the [[Cold War]] era, the former Soviet Union invested heavily in science, attempting to match American achievements in nuclear science and its military and industrial applications. At the same time, the United States invested heavily in advancing its own nuclear research and development activities through a system of [[United States Department of Energy national laboratories|National laboratories]] managed by the newly formed [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] in collaboration with the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. This era of competition in science and weapons development was known as the [[arms race]]. In October 1957, the Soviet Union's successful launch of [[Sputnik]] spurred a strong reaction in the United States and a period of competition between the two new world [[superpower]]s in a [[space race]]. In reaction to [[Sputnik]], President Eisenhower formed the [[President's Science Advisory Commission]] (PSAC).  Its November 1960 report, "Scientific Progress, the Universities, and the Federal Government," was also known as the "Seaborg Report" after University of California, Berkeley Chancellor [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], the 1951 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry. The Seaborg Report, which emphasized federal funding for science and [[pure research]], is credited with influencing the federal policy towards academic science for the next eight years. PSAC member John Bardeen observed: "There was a time not long ago when science was so starved for funds that one could say almost any increase was desirable, but this is no longer true. We shall have to review our science budgets with particular care to [maintaining] a healthy rate of growth on a broad base and not see our efforts diverted into unprofitable channels." &lt;ref&gt;True Genius: The Life and Science of John Bardeen," ([[Washington, D.C.]]: Joseph Henry Press, 2002), p. 256 available online at http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309084083/html/256.html  page viewed July 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s appointment of Seaborg as Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission in 1961, put a respected scientist in a prominent government post where he could influence science policy for the next 11 years. In an address at [[Rice University]] in 1962, President Kennedy escalated the American commitment to the space program by identifying an important objective in the space race: "We choose to go to the [[moon]] in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard." [https://web.archive.org/web/20060912083212/http://webcast.rice.edu/speeches/19620912kennedy.html]. Federal funding for both pure and [[applied research]] reached unprecedented levels as the era of [[Big Science]] continued throughout the Cold War, largely due to desires to win the arms race and space race, but also because of American desires to make advances in medicine.

===State funding cuts===

Starting with the first [[1973 oil crisis|Oil shock]], an [[economic crisis]] hit the western world which made it more difficult for the states to maintain their uncritical funding of research and teaching. In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[University Grants Committee (UK)|University Grants Committee]] started to lower their annual block grant for certain universities as soon as 1974. This was compounded by the access to power of the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] government in 1979, who pledged a radical reduction of public spending. Between 1979 and 1981, more cuts in the block grant threatened universities and became opportunities seized by certain actors (heads of departments, vice-chancellors, etc.) for radical reorganisation and reorientation of the university's research.
In 1970 in the United States, the Military Authorization Act forbade the DOD to support research unless it had "direct or apparent relationship
to a specific military function." This cut the ability of the government to fund basic research.

===Selectivity===

In order to administer severely depleted resources in a (theoretically) transparent manner, several [[Discrimination|selectivity]] mechanisms were developed through the 1980s and 1990s. In the [[United Kingdom]], the funding cuts of 1984-1986 were accompanied by an assessment of the quality of research. This was done by estimating outside research income (from [[Research Councils]] and private business), as well as "informed prejudice" by the experts on the [[University Grants Committee (UK)|UGC]]. This became the first [[Research Assessment Exercise]], soon to be followed by many others.

In [[France]], selectivity is exercised through various means. The [[CNRS]] evaluates regularly its units and researchers. For this reason, through the 1980s-90s, the government has attempted to privilege funding for researchers with a CNRS affiliation. With the creation of a [[contract]] system finalised in 1989, all research was submitted to approval of the university for inclusion in the contract passed with the Education Ministry. This allowed universities to select and privilege research and researchers they considered better than others (usually those associated to the CNRS or other [[grands corps de recherche]]).

Critics of selectivity systems decry their inherent biases. Many selectivity systems such as the [[Research Assessment Exercise|RAE]] estimate the quality of research by its income (especially private income), and therefore favour expensive disciplines at the expense of cheap ones (see [[Matthew effect (sociology)|Matthew effect]]). They also favour more applied research (liable to attract business funding) at the expense of more fundamental science. These systems (as well as others such as [[bibliometry]]) are also open to abuse and fixing.

==21st century policy==

The NSF and OSTP have established a [[Science of science policy|Science of Science and Innovation Policy]] program known as [http://www.scienceofsciencepolicy.net/ SciSIP], aimed at understanding the field itself. ([https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=501084 NSF site])

The European Union manages research funding through the [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development]].

'''''How Children Learn''''' is a nonfiction book by educator [[John Caldwell Holt]], first published in 1967. A revised edition was released in 1983, with new chapters and commentaries.

The book focuses on Holt's interactions with young [[children]] and his observations of children [[learning]]. From them, he attempts to make sense of how and why children do the things they do. The central thesis of his work is that children learn most effectively by their own [[motivation]] and on their own terms. He opposes [[teaching]] in general, believing that children find it just as patronizing as would an adult and that [[parent]]s should provide information only as it is requested.

Children learn best when they are not pressured to learn in a way that is of no interest to them.

'''Impact evaluation''' assesses the changes that can be attributed to a particular intervention, such as a project, program or policy, both the intended ones, as well as ideally the unintended ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTISPMA/0,,menuPK:384336~pagePK:149018~piPK:149093~theSitePK:384329,00.html World Bank Poverty Group on Impact Evaluation], accessed on January 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to outcome monitoring, which examines whether targets have been achieved, impact evaluation is structured to answer the question: how would outcomes such as participants' well-being have changed if the intervention had not been undertaken? This involves counterfactual analysis, that is, "a comparison between what actually happened and what would have happened in the absence of the intervention."&lt;ref&gt;[http://lnweb90.worldbank.org/oed/oeddoclib.nsf/DocUNIDViewForJavaSearch/35BC420995BF58F8852571E00068C6BD/$file/impact_evaluation.pdf White, H. (2006) Impact Evaluation: The Experience of the Independent Evaluation Group of the World Bank, World Bank, Washington, D.C., p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; Impact evaluations seek to answer cause-and-effect questions. In other words, they look for the changes in outcome that are directly attributable to a program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.worldbank.org/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=1&amp;products_id=23915 Gertler, Martinez, Premand, Rawlings and Vermeersch (2011) Impact Evaluation in Practice, Washington, DC:The World Bank]&lt;/ref&gt;

Impact evaluation helps people answer key questions for evidence-based policy making: what works, what doesn't, where, why and for how much? It has received increasing attention in policy making in recent years in the context of both Western and developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3ieimpact.org/media/filer/2012/05/07/Working_Paper_8.pdf|title=Log in|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an important component of the armory of [[evaluation]] tools and approaches and integral to global efforts to improve the effectiveness of aid delivery and public spending more generally in improving living standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enterprise-development.org/page/download?id=2133, '' Muaz, Jalil Mohammad (2013), Practical Guidelines for conducting research. Summarising good research practice in line with the DCED Standard'']&lt;/ref&gt; Originally more oriented towards evaluation of social sector programs in developing countries, notably [[Conditional Cash Transfer|conditional cash transfers]], impact evaluation is now being increasingly applied in other areas such as the agriculture, energy and transport.

== Counterfactual evaluation designs ==

[[Counterfactual conditional|Counterfactual]] analysis enables evaluators to attribute cause and effect between interventions and outcomes. The 'counterfactual' measures what would have happened to beneficiaries in the absence of the intervention, and impact is estimated by comparing counterfactual outcomes to those observed under the intervention. The key challenge in impact evaluation is that the counterfactual cannot be directly observed and must be approximated with reference to a comparison group. There are a range of accepted approaches to determining an appropriate comparison group for counterfactual analysis, using either prospective (ex ante) or retrospective (ex post) evaluation design. Prospective evaluations begin during the design phase of the intervention, involving collection of baseline and end-line data from intervention beneficiaries (the 'treatment group') and non-beneficiaries (the 'comparison group'); they may involve selection of individuals or communities into treatment and comparison groups. Retrospective evaluations are usually conducted after the implementation phase and may exploit existing survey data, although the best evaluations will collect data as close to baseline as possible, to ensure comparability of intervention and comparison groups.

There are five key principles relating to internal validity (study design) and external validity (generalizability) which rigorous impact evaluations should address: confounding factors, [[selection bias]], spillover effects, contamination, and impact heterogeneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3ieimpact.org/media/filer/2012/04/20/principles-for-impact-evaluation.pdf|title=Log in|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Confounding''' occurs where certain factors, typically relating to socio-economic status, are correlated with exposure to the intervention and, independent of exposure, are causally related to the outcome of interest. Confounding factors are therefore alternate explanations for an observed (possibly spurious) relationship between intervention and outcome.
* '''Selection bias''', a special case of confounding, occurs where intervention participants are non-randomly drawn from the beneficiary population, and the criteria determining selection are correlated with outcomes. [[Unobserved heterogeneity|Unobserved factors]], which are associated with access to or participation in the intervention, and are causally related to the outcome of interest, may lead to a spurious relationship between intervention and outcome if unaccounted for. Self-selection occurs where, for example, more able or organized individuals or communities, who are more likely to have better outcomes of interest, are also more likely to participate in the intervention. Endogenous program selection occurs where individuals or communities are chosen to participate because they are seen to be more likely to benefit from the intervention. Ignoring confounding factors can lead to a problem of omitted variable bias. In the special case of selection bias, the endogeneity of the selection variables can cause simultaneity bias.
* '''Spillover''' (referred to as contagion in the case of experimental evaluations) occurs when members of the comparison (control) group are affected by the intervention. 
* '''Contamination''' occurs when members of treatment and/or comparison groups have access to another intervention which also affects the outcome of interest.
* '''Impact heterogeneity''' refers to differences in impact due by beneficiary type and context. High quality impact evaluations will assess the extent to which different groups (e.g., the disadvantaged) benefit from an intervention as well as the potential effect of context on impact. The degree that results are generalizable will determine the applicability of lessons learned for interventions in other contexts.

Impact evaluation designs are identified by the type of methods used to generate the counterfactual and can be broadly classified into three categories – experimental, quasi-experimental and non-experimental designs – that vary in feasibility, cost, involvement during design or after implementation phase of the intervention, and degree of selection bias. White (2006)&lt;ref name="worldbank.org"&gt;[http://lnweb90.worldbank.org/oed/oeddoclib.nsf/DocUNIDViewForJavaSearch/35BC420995BF58F8852571E00068C6BD/$file/impact_evaluation.pdf White, H. (2006) Impact Evaluation: The Experience of the Independent Evaluation Group of the World Bank, World Bank, Washington, D.C.]&lt;/ref&gt; and Ravallion (2008)&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTISPMA/Resources/383704-1153333441931/Evaluating_Antipoverty_Programs.pdf Ravallion, M. (2008) Evaluating Anti-Poverty Programs]&lt;/ref&gt; discuss alternate Impact Evaluation approaches.

===Experimental design===
{{further|Experimental design}}

Under experimental evaluations the treatment and comparison groups are selected randomly and isolated both from the intervention, as well as any interventions which may affect the outcome of interest. These evaluation designs are referred to as [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized control trials]] (RCTs). In experimental evaluations the comparison group is called a [[control group]]. When randomization is implemented over a sufficiently large sample with no contagion by the intervention, the only difference between treatment and control groups on average is that the latter does not receive the intervention. Random sample surveys, in which the sample for the evaluation is chosen randomly, should not be confused with experimental evaluation designs, which require the random assignment of the treatment.

The experimental approach is often held up as the 'gold standard' of evaluation. It is the only evaluation design which can conclusively account for selection bias in demonstrating a causal relationship between intervention and outcomes. Randomization and isolation from interventions might not be practicable in the realm of social policy and may be ethically difficult to defend,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/bpj/evoice/v6y2009i2n6.html|title=Should the Randomistas Rule?|first=Ravallion|last=Martin|date=1 January 2009|publisher=|volume=6|issue=2|pages=1–5|accessdate=16 January 2017|via=RePEc - IDEAS}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there may be opportunities to use natural experiments. Bamberger and White (2007)&lt;ref name="ed.gov"&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ800319&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ800319 Bamberger, M. and White, H. (2007) Using Strong Evaluation Designs in Developing Countries: Experience and Challenges, ''Journal of MultiDisciplinary Evaluation'', Volume 4, Number 8, 58-73]&lt;/ref&gt; highlight some of the limitations to applying RCTs to development interventions. Methodological critiques have been made by Scriven (2008)&lt;ref&gt;Scriven (2008) A Summative Evaluation of RCT Methodology: &amp; An Alternative Approach to Causal Research, ''Journal of MultiDisciplinary Evaluation'', Volume 5, Number 9, 11-24&lt;/ref&gt; on account of the biases introduced since social interventions cannot be triple blinded, and Deaton (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=1335715|title=Instruments of Development: Randomization in the Tropics, and the Search for the Elusive Keys to Economic Development|first=Angus|last=Deaton|date=1 January 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out that in practice analysis of RCTs falls back on the regression-based approaches they seek to avoid and so are subject to the same potential biases. Other problems include the often heterogeneous and changing contexts of interventions, logistical and practical challenges, difficulties with monitoring service delivery, access to the intervention by the comparison group and changes in selection criteria and/or intervention over time. Thus, it is estimated that RCTs are only applicable to 5 percent of development finance.&lt;ref name="ed.gov"/&gt;

===Quasi-experimental design===

[[Quasi-experiment]]al approaches can remove bias arising from selection on observables and, where panel data are available, time invariant unobservables. Quasi-experimental methods include matching, differencing, instrumental variables and the pipeline approach; they are usually carried out by multivariate [[regression analysis]].

If selection characteristics are known and observed, they can be controlled for to remove the bias. Matching involves comparing program participants with non-participants based on observed selection characteristics. [[Propensity score matching]] (PSM) uses a statistical model to calculate the probability of participating on the basis of a set of observable characteristics and matches participants and non-participants with similar probability scores. [[Regression discontinuity design]] exploits a decision rule as to who does and does not get the intervention to compare outcomes for those just either side of this cut-off.

Difference-in-differences or double differences, which use data collected at baseline and end-line for intervention and comparison groups, can be used to account for selection bias under the assumption that unobservable factors determining selection are fixed over time (time invariant).

[[Instrumental Variable|Instrumental variables]] estimation accounts for selection bias by modelling participation using factors ('instruments') that are correlated with selection but not the outcome, thus isolating the aspects of program participation which can be treated as exogenous.

The pipeline approach ([[stepped-wedge trial|stepped-wedge design]]) uses beneficiaries already chosen to participate in a project at a later stage as the comparison group. The assumption is that as they have been selected to receive the intervention in the future they are similar to the treatment group, and therefore comparable in terms of outcome variables of interest. However, in practice, it cannot be guaranteed that treatment and comparison groups are comparable and some method of matching will need to be applied to verify comparability.

===Non-experimental design===

Non-experimental impact evaluations are so-called because they do not involve a comparison group that does not have access to the intervention. The method used in non-experimental evaluation is to compare intervention groups before and after implementation of the intervention. Intervention [[interrupted time-series]] (ITS) evaluations require multiple data points on treated individuals before and after the intervention, while before versus after (or pre-test post-test) designs simply require a single data point before and after. Post-test analyses include data after the intervention from the intervention group only. Non-experimental designs are the weakest evaluation design, because to show a causal relationship between intervention and outcomes convincingly, the evaluation must demonstrate that any likely alternate explanations for the outcomes are irrelevant. However, there remain applications to which this design is relevant, for example, in calculating time-savings from an intervention which improves access to amenities. In addition, there may be cases where non-experimental designs are the only feasible impact evaluation design, such as universally implemented programmes or national policy reforms in which no isolated comparison groups are likely to exist.

== Biases in estimating programme effects ==

Randomized field experiments are the strongest research designs for assessing program impact. This particular research design is said to generally be the design of choice when it is feasible as it allows for a fair and accurate estimate of the program's actual effects (Rossi, Lipsey &amp; Freeman, 2004).

With that said, randomized field experiments are not always feasible to carry out and in these situations there are alternative research designs that are at the disposal of an evaluator. The main problem though is that regardless of which design an evaluator chooses, they are prone to a common problem: Regardless of how well thought through or well implemented the design is, each design is subject to yielding biased estimates of the program effects. These biases play the role of exaggerating or diminishing program effects. Not only that, but the direction the bias may take cannot usually be known in advance (Rossi et al., 2004). These biases affect the interest of the stakeholder. Furthermore, it is possible that program participants are disadvantaged if the bias is in such a way that it contributes to making an ineffective or harmful program seem effective. There is also the possibility that a bias can make an effective program seem ineffective or even as far as harmful. This could possibly make the accomplishments of program seem small or even insignificant therefore forcing the personnel and even cause the program's sponsors to reduce or eliminate the funding for the program (Rossi et al., 2004).

It is safe to say that if an inadequate design yields bias, the stakeholders who are largely responsible for the funding of the program will be the ones most concerned; the results of the evaluation help the stakeholders decide whether or not to continue funding the program because the final decision lies with the funders and the sponsors. Not only are the stakeholders mostly concerned, but those taking part in the program or those the program is intended to positively affect will be affected by the design chosen and the outcome rendered by that chosen design. Therefore, the evaluator's concern is to minimize the amount of bias in the estimation of program effects (Rossi et al., 2004).
 
Biases are normally visible in two situations: when the measurement of the outcome with program exposure or the estimate of what the outcome would have been without the program exposure is higher or lower than the corresponding "true" value (p267). Unfortunately, not all forms of bias that may compromise impact assessment are obvious (Rossi et al., 2004).

The most common form of impact evaluation design is comparing two groups of individuals or other units, an intervention group that receives the program and a control group that does not. The estimate of program effect is then based on the difference between the groups on a suitable outcome measure (Rossi et al., 2004). The random assignment of individuals to program and control groups allows for making the assumption of continuing equivalence. Group comparisons that have not been formed through randomization are known as non-equivalent comparison designs (Rossi et al., 2004).

===Selection bias===

When there is an absence of the assumption of equivalence, the difference in outcome between the groups that would have occurred regardless creates a form of bias in the estimate of program effects. This is known as selection bias (Rossi et al., 2004). It creates a threat to the validity of the program effect estimate in any impact assessment using a non-equivalent group comparison design and appears in situations where some process responsible for influences that are not fully known selects which individuals will be in which group instead of the assignment to groups being determined by pure chance (Rossi et al., 2004).  This may be because of participant self-selection, or it may be because of program placement (placement bias).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/392376/impact-evaluation-development-interventions-guide.pdf|title=Impact Evaluation of Development Interventions: A Practical Guide|last=White|first=Howard|last2=Raitzer|first2=David|publisher=Asian Development Bank|year=2017|isbn=978-92-9261-059-3|location=Manila|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selection bias can occur through natural or deliberate processes that cause a loss of outcome data for members of the intervention and control groups that have already been formed. This is known as attrition and it can come about in two ways (Rossi et al., 2004): targets drop out of the intervention or control group cannot be reached or targets refuse to co-operate in outcome measurement. Differential attrition is assumed when attrition occurs as a result of something either than explicit chance process (Rossi et al., 2004). This means that "those individuals that were from the intervention group whose outcome data are missing cannot be assumed to have the same outcome-relevant characteristics as those from the control group whose outcome data are missing" (Rossi et al., 2004, p271). However, random assignment designs are not safe from selection bias which is induced by attrition (Rossi et al., 2004).

===Other forms of bias===

There are other factors that can be responsible for bias in the results of an impact assessment. These generally have to do with events or experiences other than receiving the program that occur during the intervention. These biases include secular trends, interfering events and maturation (Rossi et al., 2004).
 
====Secular trends or secular drift====

Secular trends can be defined as being relatively long-term trends in the community, region or country. These are also termed secular drift and may produce changes that enhance or mask the apparent effects of a (Rossi et al., 2004). For example, when a community's birth rate is declining, a program to reduce fertility may appear effective because of bias stemming from that downward trend (Rossi et al., 2004, p273).

====Interfering events====

Interfering events are similar to secular trends; in this case it is the short-term events that can produce changes that may introduce bias into estimates of program effect, such as a power outage disrupting communications or hampering the delivery of food supplements may interfere with a nutrition program (Rossi et al., 2004, p273).

====Maturation====

Impact evaluation needs to accommodate the fact that natural maturational and developmental processes can produce considerable change independently of the program. Including these changes in the estimates of program effects would result in bias estimates. An example of this form of bias would be a program to improve preventative health practices among adults may seem ineffective because health generally declines with age (Rossi et al., 2004, p273).

"Careful maintenance of comparable circumstances for program and control groups between random assignment and outcome measurement should prevent bias from the influence of other differential experiences or events on the groups. If either of these conditions is absent from the design, there is potential for bias in the estimates of program effect" (Rossi et al., 2004, p274).

== Estimation methods ==

Estimation methods broadly follow evaluation designs. Different designs require different estimation methods to measure changes in well-being from the counterfactual. In experimental and quasi-experimental evaluation, the estimated impact of the intervention is calculated as the difference in mean outcomes between the treatment group (those receiving the intervention) and the control or comparison group (those who don't). This method is also called randomised control trials (RCT). According to an interview with Jim Rough, former representant of the American Evaluation Assosiciation, in the magazine [http://www.dandc.eu/articles/220609/index.en.shtml D+C Development and Cooperation] this method doesn't work for complex, multilayer matters. The single difference estimator compares mean outcomes at end-line and is valid where treatment and control groups have the same outcome values at baseline. The difference-in-difference (or double difference) estimator calculates the difference in the change in the outcome over time for treatment and comparison groups, thus utilizing data collected at baseline for both groups and a second round of data collected at end-line, after implementation of the intervention, which may be years later.

Impact Evaluations which have to compare average outcomes in the treatment group, irrespective of beneficiary participation (also referred to as 'compliance' or 'adherence'), to outcomes in the comparison group are referred to as intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. Impact Evaluations which compare outcomes among beneficiaries who comply or adhere to the intervention in the treatment group to outcomes in the control group are referred to as treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) analyses. ITT therefore provides a lower-bound estimate of impact, but is arguably of greater policy relevance than TOT in the analysis of voluntary programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED493363.pdf Bloom, H. (2006) The core analytics of randomized experiments for social research. MDRC Working Papers on Research Methodology. MDRC, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debates ==

While there is agreement on the importance of impact evaluation, and a consensus is emerging around the use of counterfactual evaluation methods, there has also been widespread debate in recent years on both the definition of impact evaluation and the use of appropriate methods (see White 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3ieimpact.org/en/evaluation/working-papers/working-paper-1/ White, H. (2009) Some reflections on current debates in impact evaluation, Working paper 1, International Initiative for Impact Evaluation, New Delhi]&lt;/ref&gt; for an overview).

=== Definitions ===

The International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) defines rigorous impact evaluations as: "analyses that measure the net change in outcomes for a particular group of people that can be attributed to a specific program using the best methodology available, feasible and appropriate to the evaluation question that is being investigated and to the specific context".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3ieimpact.org/media/filer/2012/04/20/principles-for-impact-evaluation.pdf|title=Log in|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the World Bank's DIME Initiative, "Impact evaluations compare the outcomes of a program against a counterfactual that shows what would have happened to beneficiaries without the program. Unlike other forms of evaluation, they permit the attribution of observed changes in outcomes to the program being evaluated by following experimental and quasi-experimental designs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTDEVIMPEVAINI/Resources/DIME_project_document-rev.pdf World Bank (n.d.) The Development IMpact Evaluation (DIME) Initiative, Project Document, World Bank, Washington, D.C.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, according to the US [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] impact evaluation is a form of evaluation that assesses the net effect of a program by comparing program outcomes with an estimate of what would have happened in the absence of a program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/evaluate/glossary/i-esd.htm US Environmental Protection Agency Program Evaluation Glossary], accessed on January 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the World Bank's [[Independent Evaluation Group]] (IEG), impact evaluation is the systematic identification of the effects positive or negative, intended or not on individual households, institutions, and the environment caused by a given development activity such as a program or project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldbank.org/ieg/ie/ World Bank Independent Evaluation Group], accessed on January 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Impact evaluation has been defined differently over the past few decades.&lt;ref name="worldbank.org"/&gt; Other interpretations of impact evaluation include:
*An evaluation which looks at the impact of an intervention on final welfare outcomes, rather than only at project outputs, or a process evaluation which focuses on implementation;
*An evaluation carried out some time (five to ten years) after the intervention has been completed so as to allow time for impact to appear; and
*An evaluation considering all interventions within a given sector or geographical area.
Other authors make a distinction between "impact evaluation" and "impact assessment." "Impact evaluation" uses empirical techniques to estimate the effects of interventions and their statistical significance, whereas "impact assessment" includes a broader set of methods, including structural simulations and other approaches that cannot test for statistical significance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Common definitions of 'impact' used in evaluation generally refer to the totality of longer-term consequences associated with an intervention on quality-of-life outcomes. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Development Assistance Committee (OECD-DAC) defines impact as the "positive and negative, primary and secondary long-term effects produced by a development intervention, directly or indirectly, intended or unintended".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/8/43/40501129.pdf OECD-DAC (2002) Glossary of Key Terms in Evaluation and Results-Based Management Proposed Harmonized Terminology, OECD, Paris]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of international agencies have also adopted this definition of impact. For example, UNICEF defines impact as "The longer term results of a program – technical, economic, socio-cultural, institutional, environmental or other – whether intended or unintended. The intended impact should correspond to the program goal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/evaldatabase/files/UNICEF_Eval_Report_Standards.pdf UNICEF (2004) UNICEF Evaluation Report Standards, Evaluation Office, UNICEF NYHQ, New York]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Evaluationwiki.org defines impact evaluation as an evaluation that looks beyond the immediate results of policies, instruction, or services to identify longer-term as well as unintended program effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evaluationwiki.org/index.php/Evaluation_Definition:_What_is_Evaluation%3F#Impact_Evaluations|title=Evaluation Definition: What is Evaluation? - EvaluationWiki|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically, an evaluation could be conducted to assess 'impact' as defined here without reference to a counterfactual. However, much of the existing literature (e.g. NONIE Guidelines on Impact Evaluation&lt;ref name="worldbank.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/ieg/nonie/guidance.html|title=Page Not Found|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopts the OECD-DAC definition of impact while referring to the techniques used to attribute impact to an intervention as necessarily based on counterfactual analysis.

What is missing from the term 'impact' evaluation is the way 'impact' shows up long-term. For instance, most Monitoring and Evaluation 'logical framework' plans have inputs-outputs-outcomes and... impacts. While the first three appear during the project duration itself, impact takes far longer to take place. For instance, in a 5-year agricultural project, seeds are inputs, farmers trained in using them our outputs, changes in crop yields as a result of the seeds being planted properly in an outcome and families being more sustainably food secure over time is an impact.  Such [http://valuingvoices.com/sustained-impact-post-project-ex-post-little-proof-at-3ie/ post-project impact evaluations] are very rare. They are also called ex-post evaluations or we are coining the term [http://valuingvoices.com/what-happens-after-the-project-ends-lessons-from-post-project-sustained-impact-evaluations-part-1/ sustained impact evaluations]. While hundreds of thousands of documents call for them, rarely do donors have the funding flexibility - or interest - to return to see how sustained, and durable our interventions remained after project close out, after resources were withdrawn. There are many [http://valuingvoices.com/what-happens-after-the-project-ends-lessons-from-post-project-sustained-impact-evaluations-part-1/ lessons to be learned for design, implementation, M&amp;E] and how to foster [http://valuingvoices.com/what-happens-after-the-project-ends-country-national-ownership-lessons-from-post-project-sustained-impact-evaluations-part-2/ country-ownership].

=== Methodological debates ===

There is intensive debate in academic circles around the appropriate methodologies for impact evaluation, between proponents of experimental methods on the one hand and proponents of more general methodologies on the other. William Easterly has referred to this as [http://aidwatchers.com/2009/12/the-civil-war-in-development-economics/ 'The Civil War in Development economics']. Proponents of experimental designs, sometimes referred to as 'randomistas',&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; argue randomization is the only means to ensure unobservable selection bias is accounted for, and that building up the flimsy experimental evidence base should be developed as a matter of priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdgoals.net/wp-content/uploads/banerjee.pdf|title=Banerjee, A. V. (2007) 'Making Aid Work' Cambridge, Boston Review Book, MIT Press, MA|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, others argue that randomized assignment is seldom appropriate to development interventions and even when it is, experiments provide us with information on the results of a specific intervention applied to a specific context, and little of external relevance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ800319&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ800319 Bamberger, M. and White, H. (2007) Using Strong Evaluation Designs in Developing Countries: Experience and Challenges, Journal of MultiDisciplinary Evaluation, Volume 4, Number 8, 58-73]&lt;/ref&gt; There has been criticism from evaluation bodies and others that some donors and academics over-emphasize favoured methods for impact evaluation,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europeanevaluation.org/download/?noGzip=1&amp;id=1969403 EES Statement on the importance of a methodologically diverse approach to impact evaluation&lt;/ref&gt; and that this may in fact hinder learning and accountability.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/odi-publications/opinions/127-impact-evaluation.pdf The 'gold standard' is not a silver bullet for evaluation&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there has been a debate around the appropriate role for qualitative methods within impact evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.odi.org/publications/430-aid-effectiveness-role-qualitative-research-impact-evaluation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/146499341201300104&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theory-based impact evaluation ===

While knowledge of effectiveness is vital, it is also important to understand the reasons for effectiveness and the circumstances under which results are likely to be replicated. In contrast with 'black box' impact evaluation approaches, which only report mean differences in outcomes between treatment and comparison groups, theory-based impact evaluation involves mapping out the causal chain from inputs to outcomes and impact and testing the underlying assumptions.&lt;ref name="3ieimpact.org"&gt;[http://www.3ieimpact.org/en/evaluation/working-papers/working-paper-3/ White, H. (2009b) Theory-based impact evaluation: Principles and practice, Working Paper 3, International Initiative for Impact Evaluation, New Delhi]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worldbank.org1"/&gt; Most interventions within the realm of public policy are of a voluntary, rather than coercive (legally required) nature. In addition, interventions are often active rather than passive, requiring a greater rather than lesser degree of participation among beneficiaries and therefore behavior change as a pre-requisite for effectiveness. Public policy will therefore be successful to the extent that people are incentivized to change their behaviour favourably. A theory-based approach enables policy-makers to understand the reasons for differing levels of program participation (referred to as 'compliance' or 'adherence') and the processes determining behavior change. Theory-Based approaches use both quantitative and qualitative data collection, and the latter can be particularly useful in understanding the reasons for compliance and therefore whether and how the intervention may be replicated in other settings. Methods of qualitative data collection include focus groups, in-depth interviews, participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and field visits, as well as reading of anthropological and political literature.

White (2009b)&lt;ref name="3ieimpact.org"/&gt; advocates more widespread application of a theory-based approach to impact evaluation as a means to improve policy relevance of impact evaluations, outlining six key principles of the theory-based approach:
# Map out the causal chain (program theory) which explains how the intervention is expected to lead to the intended outcomes, and collect data to test the underlying assumptions of the causal links.
# Understand context, including the social, political and economic setting of the intervention.
# Anticipate heterogeneity to help in identifying sub-groups and adjusting the sample size to account for the levels of disaggregation to be used in the analysis.
# Rigorous evaluation of impact using a credible counterfactual (as discussed above).
# Rigorous factual analysis of links in the causal chain.
# Use mixed methods (a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods).

== Examples ==

While experimental impact evaluation methodologies have been used to assess nutrition and water and sanitation interventions in developing countries since the 1980s, the first, and best known, application of experimental methods to a large-scale development program is the evaluation of the [[Conditional Cash Transfer]] (CCT) program Progresa (now called [[Oportunidades]]) in Mexico, which examined a range of development outcomes, including schooling, immunization rates and child work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/gertler_health.pdf Gertler, P. (2000) Final Report: The Impact of PROGRESA on Health. International Food Policy Research Institute, Washington, D.C.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://athena.sas.upenn.edu/~petra/papers/trans18.pdf|title=Untitled Document|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCT programs have since been implemented by a number of governments in Latin America and elsewhere, and a report released by the World Bank in February 2009 examines the impact of CCTs across twenty countries.&lt;ref&gt;Fiszbein, A. and Schady, N. (2009) Conditional Cash Transfers: Reducing present and future poverty: A World Bank Policy Research Report, World Bank, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, impact evaluation has been applied to a range of interventions across social and productive sectors. 3ie has launched an online [http://www.3ieimpact.org/database_of_impact_evaluations.html database of impact evaluations] covering studies conducted in low- and middle income countries. Other organisations publishing Impact Evaluations include [http://poverty-action.org/work/publications Innovations for Poverty Action], the World Bank's [http://www.worldbank.org/dime DIME Initiative] and [http://www.worldbank.org/ieg/nonie/papers.html NONIE]. The [[Independent Evaluation Group|IEG]] of the World Bank has systematically assessed and summarized the experience of ten impact evaluation of development programs in various sectors carried out over the past 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/oed/oeddoclib.nsf/DocUNIDViewForJavaSearch/35BC420995BF58F8852571E00068C6BD/$file/impact_evaluation.pdf Impact Evaluation: The Experience of the Independent Evaluation Group of the World Bank, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations promoting impact evaluation of development interventions ==

In 2006, the Evaluation Gap Working Group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/7973|title=When Will We Ever Learn? Improving Lives Through Impact Evaluation|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued for a major gap in the evidence on development interventions, and in particular for an independent body to be set up to plug the gap by funding and advocating for rigorous impact evaluation in low- and middle-income countries. The [http://www.3ieimpact.org International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie)] was set up in response to this report. 3ie seeks to improve the lives of poor people in low- and middle-income countries by providing, and summarizing, evidence of what works, when, why and for how much. 3ie operates a grant program, financing impact studies in low- and middle-income countries and synthetic reviews of existing evidence updated as new evidence appears, and supports quality impact evaluation through its quality assurance services.

Another initiative devoted to the evaluation of impacts is the [http://sustainablecommodities.org/cosa Committee on Sustainability Assessment (COSA)].  COSA is a non-profit global consortium of institutions, sustained in partnership with the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) [[Sustainable Commodity Initiative]], the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), and the United Nations [[International Trade Centre]] (ITC). COSA is developing and applying an independent measurement tool to analyze the distinct social, environmental and economic impacts of agricultural practices, and in particular those associated with the implementation of specific sustainability programs (Organic, [[Fairtrade]] etc.).  The focus of the initiative is to establish global indicators and measurement tools which farmers, policy-makers, and industry can use to understand and improve their sustainability with different crops or agricultural sectors. COSA aims to facilitate this by enabling them to accurately calculate the relative costs and benefits of becoming involved in any given sustainability initiative.

A number of additional organizations have been established to promote impact evaluation globally, including [http://poverty-action.org/ Innovations for Poverty Action], the [http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/sief-trust-fund World Bank's Strategic Impact Evaluation Fund (SIEF)], the World Bank's Development Impact Evaluation (DIME) Initiative, the [http://www.cgiar-ilac.org Institutional Learning and Change (ILAC) Initiative] of the CGIAR, and the [http://www.worldbank.org/ieg/nonie/ Network of Networks on Impact Evaluation (NONIE)].

== Systematic reviews of impact evidence ==

A range of organizations are working to coordinate the production of [[systematic reviews]]. Systematic reviews aim to bridge the research-policy divide by assessing the range of existing evidence on a particular topic, and presenting the information in an accessible format. Like rigorous impact evaluations, they are developed from a study Protocol which sets out a priori the criteria for study inclusion, search and methods of synthesis. Systematic reviews involve five key steps: determination of interventions, populations, outcomes and study designs to be included; searches to identify published and unpublished literature, and application of study inclusion criteria (relating to interventions, populations, outcomes and study design), as set out in study Protocol; coding of information from studies; presentation of quantitative estimates on intervention effectiveness using forest plots and, where interventions are determined as appropriately homogeneous, calculation of a pooled summary estimate using meta-analysis; finally, systematic reviews should be updated periodically as new evidence emerges. Systematic reviews may also involve the synthesis of qualitative information, for example relating to the barriers to, or facilitators of, intervention effectiveness.

Organizations supporting the production of systematic reviews include the [http://www.cochrane.org/ Cochrane Collaboration], which has been coordinating systematic reviews in the medical and public health fields since 1993, and publishes the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090414113230/http://www.cochrane-handbook.org/ Cochrane Handbook] which is definitive systematic review methodology guide. In addition, the [http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/ Campbell Collaboration] has coordinated the production of systematic reviews of social interventions since 2000, and the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (in partnership with the Campbell Collaboration) is funding systematic reviews of social programs in developing countries. Other organizations supporting systematic reviews include the [http://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx Institute of Education's EPPI-Centre] and the [http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/crd/ University of York's Centre for Reviews and Dissemination].

The body of evidence from systematic reviews is large and available through various online portals including the [http://www.thecochranelibrary.com/ Cochrane library], the [http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/library.php Campbell library], and the [http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/crdweb/ Centre for Reviews and Dissemination]. The available evidence from Reviews of development interventions in low- and middle-income countries is being built up by organisations such as the [http://www.3ieimpact.org/en/evidence/systematic-reviews/ International Initiative for Impact Evaluation's synthetic reviews programme].

[[File:Isabel Aretz.jpg|thumb|right|Isabel Aretz-Thiele]]

'''Isabel Aretz''' (14 April 1909{{spaced ndash}}2 June 2005) was an [[Argentine]]–[[Venezuelan people|Venezuelan]] researcher, writer, [[ethnomusicologist]] and composer.

==Early years==
Isabel Aretz-Thiele was born in [[Buenos Aires]]. She was educated at the National Conservatory of Music and Performing Arts, studying pedagogy, piano with [[Rafael González (musician)|Rafael González]] and harmony, counterpoint and composition with [[Althos Palma]]. She earned a doctorate in music from Catholic University of Argentina in 1968.

==Career==
After completing her initial studies, Aretz became a senior lecturer at the National Conservatory and began work as an ethnomusic researcher and composer. In 1937 her orchestral work ''Punto'' premiered at the Teatro Cervantes. In the next decade, she collected and recorded traditional music, traveling in [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]], [[Chile]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]]. In 1947 she married Venezuelan musician and writer [[Luis Felipe Ramón y Rivera]].

She was asked that same year to organize the music section of the Folklore Research Service established in Venezuela, and she continued her research on folk music there. In 1966 she was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] to record native melodies in [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and Central America.

Aretz-Thiele founded the American Institute of Ethnomusicology and Folklore (INIDEF) in Venezuela and chaired the institution from 1990 and 1995. She became a professor of ethnomusicology at the School of Arts, Central University of Venezuela, and at Indiana University in the United States. She was also a guest lecturer at other universities in Mexico and [[Colombia]].

Aretz-Thiele published a number of journal articles and about twenty-five books on American folklore, plus an autobiography. After her husband died in 1992, she was appointed a member of the Academy of Arts and Sciences in Argentina, and she returned to [[San Isidro, Buenos Aires|San Isidro]] to live and work until her death in June 2005.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[[:es:Isabel Aretz|Murió en Argentina la investigadora Isabel Aretz]]{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julio Cabrera''' is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] living in [[Brazil]]. He is a retired professor of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Brasília and former head of the department. Previously he taught in Argentina, at the National University of Córdoba, the University of Belgrano and then in Brazil at the Federal University of Santa Maria. Currently, he is a senior associate researcher, by invitation, in the Bioethics Doctoral Program of the University of Brasília. He is best known for his works on "negative ethics" and cinema and philosophy. Other areas of philosophy that he deals with are philosophy of language, logic and Latin American philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/fundacionjaimeroca/docs/juliocabrera] ''Entrevista al Dr. Julio Cabrera'', Serie Entrevistas, Fundación Dr. Jaime Roca, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihuonline.unisinos.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4175] ''Sem grandes intuiçoes, nao há grande filosofia'', Instituto Humanitas Unisinos, number 379, November 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/preview.do?metodo=apresentar&amp;id=K4781131E6] Biogram on Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://philosopherjuliocabrera.blogspot.com/2011/05/who-i-am.html] J. Cabrera, ''Who I am''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negative ethics ==

In his book ''A Critique of Affirmative Morality (A reflection on Death, Birth and the Value of Life)''&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/17430/3/Livro_CritiqueAffirmativeMorality.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''A critique of affirmative morality (A reflection on death, birth and the value of life)'', Brasília: Julio Cabrera Editions, 2014 (English edition). J. Cabrera, ''Crítica de la moral afirmativa: Una reflexión sobre nacimiento, muerte y valor de la vida'', Barcelona: Gedisa, 1996 (original Spanish edition).&lt;/ref&gt;, Julio Cabrera presents his theory about the value of human existence. Human life, for Cabrera, is "structurally negative" in that its constitutive components are inherently adverse: as prominent among them Cabrera cites loss, scarcity, [[pain]], conflicts, fragility, [[illness]], [[aging]], [[boredom]] and [[death]]. According to Cabrera they form the basic structure to human life, which he analyzes through what he calls [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], drawing freely from thinkers such as [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Cabrera has called his work an attempt to put together Schopenhauer and Heidegger, introducing a determinant judgement of the value of Being into the analysis of [[Dasein]], and putting morality above life, against Nietzsche. 

Cabrera develops an ethical theory, negative ethics, that is informed by this phenomenological analysis. He argues that there has been an unwarranted prejudice in ethics against non-Being, a view he calls "affirmativity". Because affirmative views take Being as good, they always view things that threaten this hegemony as bad; particularly things like abstention from [[procreation]] or [[suicide]]. Cabrera criticizes affirmative ethics for asking how people should live without asking the radical question of whether people should live tout court. He argues that, because of the structural negativity of Being, there is a fundamental "moral disqualification" of human beings due to the impossibility of nonharming and nonmanipulating others. Nonharming and nonmanipulating others is called by him the "fundamental ethical articulation" ("FEA"). The FEA is violated by our structural "moral impediment", by the worldly discomforts – notably pain and discouragement – imposed on us that prevent us from acting ethically. Cabrera argues that an affirmative morality is a self-contradiction because it conceives a human existence that precludes the possibility of not-harming or not-manipulating others. Thus he believes that affirmative societies, through their politics, require the common suspension of the FEA to even function.

As a response to the negative structure of Being, Cabrera's negative ethics is acutely aware of the morally disqualifying nature of Being. Cabrera believes children are usually considered as mere aesthetic objects, are not created for their own sake but for the sake of their parents, and are thrown into a structurally negative life by the act of procreation. Procreation is, as Cabrera argues, a supreme act of manipulation, a harm  and a violation of autonomy. He argues that the consistent application of normal moral concepts – like duty, virtue or respect – present in most affirmative moralities entails [[antinatalism]]. Cabrera also believes that a human being adopting negative ethics should not only abstain from procreation, but also should have a complete willingness for an ethical death, by immediate suspension of all personal projects in benefit of a political fight&lt;ref name=autoname1&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Políticas negativas y ética de la libertación. ¿Es posible ser um pessimista revolucionário? (Mi encuentro con Enrique Dussel)'', Essay 9 in: ''Análisis y existencia: pensamiento en travesía'', Córdoba: Ediciones del Copista, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; or an altruistic suicide, when it becomes the least immoral course of action.

Cabrera’s ''Critique'' is one of his most systematic defenses of negative ethics, but he has also explored the same ideas in other works, such as ''Projeto de Ética Negativa''&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Projeto de Ética Negativa'', São Paulo: Mandacaru, 1989 (second edition: ''A Ética e Suas Negações, Não nascer, suicídio e pequenos assassinatos'', Rio De Janeiro: Rocco, 2011). [https://misantropiaemelancolia.wordpress.com/2017/10/24/project-of-negative-ethics/] English translation of the first chapter of ''Projeto de Ética Negativa''.&lt;/ref&gt;, ''Ética Negativa: problemas e discussoes''&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera (ed.), ''Ética Negativa: problemas e discussoes'', Goiânia: UFG, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;, ''Porque te amo, não nascerás!

Cabrera, ''Mal-estar e moralidade: situação humana, ética e procriação responsável'', Brasília: UnB, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cinema and philosophy ==

In his first book about cinema-philosophical thought, ''Cine, 100 anos de filosofia: Una Introducción a la Filosofia A Traves del Análisis de Películas''&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Cine, 100 años de filosofia: Una Introducción a la Filosofia A Traves del Análisis de Películas'', Barcelona: Gedisa, 1999 (second edition in 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;, Julio Cabrera proposes the notion of "logopathy" (from Greek: "logos" – "reason" and "páthos" – "feelings"), that is, of "cognitive-affective concepts", treating them as capable of putting in question the traditional view of philosophy about concepts, which he calls apathetic and tied to purely [[intellectualism|intellectual]] concepts. Cabrera sustains that logopathic philosophy is of the order of meaning, and not of truth, and that it adds affective elements of judgment to these traditional intellectual view of concepts. 

Cabrera considers cinema one of the most fruitful means for the generation of concepts of a logopathic type, specifically denominated by him as "concept-image", as opposed to "concept-idea", the apathetic type of concept. He believes that cinema, by its powerful audiovisual means of expression, would provide a "superpotentiation" of conceptual possibilities, and therefore, of the establishment of the experience of the film, indispensable to the development of the concept-image, with the consequent increase of affective impact.

On the other hand, Cabrera believes that throughout history of European philosophy, at various moments, written philosophy – the opposite of visual philosophy – has also been logopathic, it has thought through affections, but without assuming it openly, while cinema usually has been seen only as a mere affective phenomenon, without relevant cognitive power. His notions of logopathy and concept-image seek to eliminate this dichotomy, pointing to the affectivity of the intellect and the cognitiveness of affections.
 
Cabrera gave continuity to the exposition of his cinema-philosophy thinking in books like ''De Hitchcock a Greenaway pela história da filosofia: novas reflexoes sobre cinema e filosofia''&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/15246/1/LIVRO_HitchcockGreenawaypelahistoria.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''De Hitchcock a Greenaway pela história da filosofia: novas reflexoes sobre cinema e filosofia'', São Paulo: Nankin, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; (a sort of second volume of ''Cine: 100 anos de filosofia'') and  ''Diálogo/cinema''&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, M. Tiburi, ''Diálogo/cinema'', São Paulo: Senac, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;, where in a debate through letters with Marcia Tiburi, he discusses the subject from the perspective that, long before the invention of the cinema, philosophy was already "filming" ideas through images, and also in articles ''Para una des-comprensión filosófica Del cine: el caso Inland Empire de David Lynch''&lt;ref&gt;[https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3003168] J. Cabrera, ''Para una des-comprensión filosófica Del cine: el caso Inland Empire de David Lynch'', Enl@ce, year 6, number 2, Maracaibo: Universidad del Zulia, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;, ''Três ensaios sobre a repetição: Kierkegaard, Jarmush, Hitchcock, Van Sant e três damas que desembarcam antes de chegar (Uma reflexão transversal sobre escrita e imagem)''&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Três ensaios sobre a repetição: Kierkegaard, Jarmush, Hitchcock, Van Sant e três damas que desembarcam antes de chegar (Uma reflexão transversal sobre escrita e imagem)'', in: Ri. Timm De Souza et alia, ''Literatura e Cinema. Encontros contemporâneos'', Porto Alegre: Dublinense, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;, ''Existencia naufragada. Los 4 viajes del Titanic''&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Existencia naufragada. Los 4 viajes del Titanic'', Per la Filosofia, Pisa-Roma: Fabrizio Serra, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;, ''Repetición y cine vacío''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Repetición y cine vacío'', La Cueva de Chauvet, La Plata: Malisia, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Cine, filosofía y filosofía analítica''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Cine, filosofía y filosofía analítica'', in: F. Santamaria Velasco et alia, ''Cine y Pensamiento'', Estéticas contemporáneas 9, Bogotá-Medellin: Universidad Claretiana, Universidad Santo Tomás, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Philosophy of language and logic ==

For Cabrera, philosophies of language are philosophies for which language does not matter in so far as it merely conveys something, but insofar as it constitutes – and implements – concepts and structures of understanding of the world. From this large sense of the term, he identifies four philosophies of language, which are: [[analytic philosophy|analytical]], [[hermeneutic]], phenomenological and meta-critical. Looking through the prism of negativity, Cabrera shows how the four above types of philosophies of language fail at a common point: their incapacity to fight against the failures of meaning. For the analytics, the point presents itself in the “meaninglessness” of expressions which is treated as a limit beyond which one should not go. However, according to Cabrera, this analytic objectivism excludes fundamental dimensions of the problem of meaning, such as time and lived experience. Phenomenology expands the analytic semantic horizon with the dimension of [[intentionality]] (of which analytic [[intensionality]] is only an inauthentic correlate, essentially objective) without the problem of meaninglessness being tamed. It remains for phenomenology, however, the temporality and historicity that hermeneutics adds to the approach of the problem, which is called "misunderstanding". Hermeneutic falls into the basic "distortions of meanings", something stronger than "meaninglessness" and "misunderstanding", a subject of meta-critical philosophies, represented by [[Karl Marx|Karl Marx’s]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud’s]] philosophies of language. 

Cabrera strongly criticizes the analytic approach to language for its denial of everything that is not objective. But according to him, also the other philosophies of language show their faults, from phenomenology to hermeneutics and even meta-criticism harboring therapies redeeming only in an illusory manner: [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic healing]] or [[communism|communist utopia]]. Cabrera’s philosophy of language is a philosophy of confrontations between philosophies, which can only be made under the sign of resignation in finitude and negativism. He argues that not one of the kinds of philosophies of language that have been side-by-side in the last century and a half can, by itself, account for the complexity of the human. It is in this sense that, for Cabrera, all understanding is, ultimately, a self-sustaining illusion.

Logic for Cabrera is often linked to three fundamental principles: (1) The object that propositions deal with is indeterminate and general, (2) Logic applies to ordinary reasoning, albeit with some effort, and (3) Logic is formal rather than lexical, that is, based on the structural and non-semantic connections in language. Cabrera constructs his thought in this area by criticizing each of these three basic premises of the logical tradition. 

His intuition in this field of research is the same as in others: the intersections of traditions enriches thought and is essential to account for the human condition. Thus, logical formalization is important for thinking about existence, just as the issues of human existence are essential for understanding thinking and logic. This conception of philosophy owes the hardly unorthodox intersections that Cabrera did in his studies of logic, connecting [[Saul Kripke]] with Martin Heidegger, [[Immanuel Kant]] with [[John Langshaw Austin|John Austin]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

Cabrera's work has the expectation of allying the formal instruments to the [[existentialism|existential]] contents of life. The critique to the alleged empty generality of logic goes in this direction as well as the proposal of a lexical logic of predicative connections, in an attempt to lend to lexical analysis a formal dimension, but loaded with content. The specific work on concept networks in lexical logic was developed in partnership with the physicist Olavo Leopoldino da Silva Filho, from the University of Brasilia.

His work on logic also proceeds to a revision of the history of logic. An outline of his version of the history of logic would be as follows: (1) [[Aristotle]], in [[syllogism|syllogisms]] and beyond, (2) The [[Plato]]nic conception of logic, (3) The logic of the connections of meanings in the [[Middle Ages]], (4) Modern criticisms of [[formal logic]]: [[Francis Bacon]], [[Rene Descartes]] and [[John Locke]], the [[scientific method]] and logic, [[analysis|philosophical analysis]] and [[heuristics]], the [[Port-Royal Logic]], (5) The case of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]: what the official history took and what it didn't analyze, (6) Formal logic, [[transcendental logic]]: [[Immanuel Kant]], (7) The logic in motion of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]: Hegelian criticism of denial, (8) [[Mill's Methods|the logic of the induction]] of [[John Stuart Mill]], (9) Three conceptions of logic in the passage from the nineteenth to the twentieth century: [[Gottlob Frege]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Edmund Husserl]], logic within analysis, [[pragmatism]], and phenomenology, (10) The case of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]: what the official story took and what it didn't analyze.&lt;ref name=autoname2&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/15264/1/LIVRO_MargensFilosofiasLinguagem.pdf] J.

Cabrera, ''Diário de um filósofo no Brasil'', Unijuí: Unijuí, 2010. (second edition in 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabrera also develops a negative approach to argumentation in the field of informal logic, a pessimistic parallel theory to his negative ethics. For him, an affirmative approach to argumentation is one in which philosophical problems are considered to have one solution or at least an adequate treatment amongst many others that are inadequate and wrong. In Cabrera's view, according to the affirmative approach, the multiplicity of answers given by philosophy is a mistake which must be "resolved" in some way. On the other hand, according to the negative approach, the multiplicity of answers given by philosophy is not a mistake, but its most natural development. The negative approach to argumentation is concerned with treating one's own position and perspective not as a unique truth, but as one of many within an extensive and complex [[holism|holistic]] web of approaches and perspectives, that speak and criticize mutually without discarding one another, although each of such positions may be fiercely maintained based on its perspective and assumptions, supported on defensible grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosopherjuliocabrera.blogspot.com/2011/05/philosophy-of-logic.html] J. Cabrera, ''Philosophy of logic'', ''The negative approach to argumentation''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.unisc.br/seer/index.php/signo/article/view/7990] J. Cabrera, ''Introduçao a uma abordagem negativa da argumentaçao'', Signo, Santa Cruz do Sul, volume 42, number 73, Januar/April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Latin American philosophy ==

Cabrera argues that there are epistemic injustices associated with the practice of philosophy in [[colonialism|colonized]] contexts such as in Latin America. In a lecture in [[Unisinos|Unisinos University]], Cabrera began to enunciate the problem of colonization in philosophy in a succinct and direct way:

{{blockquote|The problem is: they come here and talk about their problems in their language, we go there and talk about their problems in their language''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filosofojuliocabrera.blogspot.com/2011/08/filosofia-no-brasil.html] J. Cabrera, ''A questão da filosofia no Brasil no contexto da reflexão sobre civilização e barbárie no pensamento argentino'', lecture given at Unisinos University, 14 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A central idea he came to defend is that the current status of philosophy in many Latin American countries is a product of the way philosophy is taught, researched, and written by local institutions that are subordinate to the international scene. Professional philosophy in these countries have been developed around commenting European (and, to a lesser extent, North American) philosophers, and this emphasis has developed as a corollary of the idea that philosophy is done only with reference to European philosophers and no Latin American is encouraged to challenge this hegemony. Alongside this inhibition of Latin American philosophy is the idea that what is European is universal while what is Latin American is merely local or national. He makes a diagnosis in the form of "acervo T" ("T collection"), theses on the hegemony of [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] philosophy; this collection of theses is understood by Cabrera as being tacitly adopted by most of the Latin American philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/18028/1/ARTIGO_EuropeuNaoSignificaUniversal.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''Europeu não significa universal, brasileiro não significa nacional'', Brasileira de Humanidades, Nabuco, number 2, November 2014/January/February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to this colonial order, Cabrera proposes and recommends several practices concerning the teaching and practice of philosophy, among them: (1) A greater attention to Latin American sources so that the history of philosophy on the continent does not continue to be ignored by local philosophers and that the work of these philosophers be as much discussed as that of European sources, (2) A stimulus to philosophy that is not from Latin America nor about Latin America, but from Latin America where the local starting point is made explicit, (3) The practice of appropriation in which philosophers from other contexts are placed in discussions of interest to Latin America. This practice can be found in important philosophical works in Latin America such as that of [[Enrique Dussel]] with which Cabrera maintained published debates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dianoia.filosoficas.unam.mx/files/1913/6132/3542/DIA52_Cabrera.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''Dussel y el suicídio'', Dianoia, XLIX, 52, 2004, pp. 111–124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autoname1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Análisis y existencia: pensamiento en travesía'', Córdoba: Ediciones del Copista, 2010, Essay 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabrera has defended the crossing of boundaries between traditions and has on many occasions shown the potential for fertilization stemming from the juxtaposition, friction and debate between philosophies originating from analytical and [[continental philosophy|continental]] traditions.&lt;ref name="autoname2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Análisis y existencia: pensamiento en travesía'', Córdoba: Ediciones del Copista, 2010, Essays 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, he extended this metaphilosophical approach in the direction of making it an element of the struggle against what he began to clearly see as the colonized state of philosophy in Latin America.

In his book ''Diário de um filósofo no Brasil'', Cabrera documents the problems of self-reliant inventive philosophy in Brazil; the book describes the environment of suppression of philosophical intuition in its many mechanisms attending to what is specific in the Brazilian colonized context.&lt;ref name="autoname3" /&gt; The book portraits what it means to philosophize from somewhere and tries to present alternatives to the philosophical commentary that can flourish even in a hostile environment. 

For Cabrera, it is important to understand from where philosophy in Latin America is made: it is made from invaded, looted, dominated countries that have been placed in intellectual subservience. He claims that this makes the philosophy produced there different from all European philosophy – and it is important to stress that no philosophy is born universal. Cabrera notes that philosophy in Brazil, especially made in departments in the academy, is particularly blind to the sources of Latin American thought, both from the classics ([[Bartolomé de Las Casas]], [[Antônio Vieira]], [[Flora Tristan]], [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], [[José Martí]] and [[José Enrique Rodó]]) and contemporary ([[José Carlos Mariátegui]], [[Edmundo O'Gorman]], [[Leopoldo Zea]], [[Miguel León Portilla]], [[Roberto Fernández Retamar]] and Santiago Castro-Gómez), known only in isolated expert communities. His proposition is a course in the history of thought that begins with pre-Columbian [[Amerindian]] thought and which does not pass through Europeans (nor Greeks) until the nineteenth century. The idea is to read nineteenth-century European philosophers who challenged intellectualist and Christian traditions, such as Arthur Schopenhauer, [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and Friedrich Nietzsche (and their precursors [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]), as influenced virtually by Amerindian ways of living and thinking.&lt;ref&gt;J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9057">The '''Massachusetts School Laws''' were three legislative acts of 1642, 1647 and 1648 enacted in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. The most famous by far is the law of 1647, also known as the '''Old Deluder Satan Law''' (after the law's first sentence) and '''The General School Law of 1642'''. These laws are commonly regarded as the historical first step toward compulsory government-directed [[public education]] in the [[United States of America]]. Shortly after they passed, similar laws were enacted in the other [[New England]] colonies.&lt;ref name="eberling"&gt;Eric R. Eberling, ''Massachusetts Education Laws of 1642, 1647, and 1648", in "Historical Dictionary of American Education'', ed. Richard J. Altenbaugh. Greenwood Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-313-28590-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most mid-Atlantic colonies followed suit, though in some Southern colonies it was a further century before publicly funded schools were established there.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick W. Shannon, ''Broken Promises: Reading Instruction in Twentieth-Century America'', p. 3. Praeger/Greenwood, 1989. {{ISBN|0-89789-161-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education provision prior to the 1647 Act ==

The law was one of a series of legislative acts directed at public education in the colony. The first Massachusetts School Law of 1642 broke with English tradition by transferring educational supervision from the clergy to the [[selectmen]] of the colony, empowering them to assess the education of children "to read &amp; understand the principles of religion and the capital laws of this country." It held parents and masters responsible for their children's and apprentices' ability to read and write, stressing education rather than schooling. However, its implementation appears to have been somewhat neglected. Probably in response to this, the 1647 law was enacted by the [[Massachusetts General Court]] to impel the towns of the colony to found, operate and fund schools.&lt;ref name="eberling" /&gt;

== Framing and provisions of the Acts ==

The 1647 legislation specifically framed ignorance as a [[Satan]]ic ill to be circumvented through the education of the country's young people. It required every town having more than 50 families to hire a teacher, and every town of more than 100 families to establish a "grammar school". Failure to comply with the mandate would result in a fine of £5. The grammar school clause was intended to prepare students to attend [[Harvard College]], whose mission was to prepare young men for the ministry.

The rationale for the law reflected the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Puritan]] ethos of the time and in particular the influence of the Reverend [[John Cotton (puritan)|John Cotton]], who was a teacher in the [[First Church of Boston]] and one of the Massachusetts Bay Colony's most influential leaders. The Puritans sought to create a literate population to ensure that, as the law put it, "[[Thorn (letter)|ye]] ould deluder, Satan" could not use illiteracy to "keepe men from the knowledge of ye [[Scriptures]]." &lt;ref&gt;Andrew J. Milson (ed.), ''Readings In American Educational Thought: From Puritanism to Progressivism'', p. 1. IAP, 2004. {{ISBN|1-59311-253-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their religious beliefs emphasized the view that personal knowledge of the Scriptures was an essential requirement for temporal living and eternal salvation.&lt;ref name="eberling" /&gt; The statute also endorsed the principle that the interpretation of the Scriptures should be done under the aegis of proper authority, namely the Puritan leaders, in order to avoid "false glosses of saint seeming deceivers".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas C. Hunt, "Bible Reading", in ''Historical Dictionary of American Education'', ed. Richard J. Altenbaugh. Greenwood Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-313-28590-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further piece of educational legislation was passed in 1648, addressing and extending the schooling requirements set out in the 1642 law. It stipulated that children and apprentices, under the authority of parents or masters, were to be taught reading, the public laws, the [[catechism]] and "some honest lawful calling, labour or employment." Selectmen were to act as supervisors of the population, conducting examinations and if necessary fining parents or placing the young with other masters if their education was neglected.&lt;ref name="eberling" /&gt;

The practical implementation of the educational laws appears to have been distinctly inconsistent. By the end of the 1650s, all eight of the 100-family towns and a third of the 50-family towns had met the respective requirements for grammar schools and the hiring of teachers. However, the remainder of the towns and many new towns ignored both mandates and instead paid the fine. The [[Massachusetts Evil Code]] of 1660 reiterated the school laws, but still met with a lack of implementation; to enforce it, a fresh act was passed in 1668.&lt;ref name="eberling" /&gt;

==Text of the Massachusetts School Law of 1642==

&lt;blockquote&gt;Forasmuch as the good education of children is of singular behoof and benefit to any Common-wealth; and whereas many parents &amp; masters are too indulgent and negligent of their duty in that kind. It is therfore ordered that the Select men of every town, in the severall precincts and quarters where they dwell, shall have a vigilant eye over their brethren &amp; neighbours, to see, first that none of them shall suffer so much barbarism in any of their families as not to indeavour to teach by themselves or others, their children &amp; apprentices so much learning as may enable them perfectly to read the English tongue, &amp; knowledge of the Capital Lawes: upon penaltie of twentie shillings for each neglect therin. Also that all masters of families do once a week (at the least) catechize their children and servants in the grounds &amp; principles of Religion, &amp; if any be unable to do so much: that then at the least they procure such children or apprentices to learn some short orthodox catechism without book, that they may be able to answer unto the questions that shall be propounded to them out of such catechism by their parents or masters or any of the Select men when they shall call them to a tryall of what they have learned of this kind. And further that all parents and masters do breed &amp; bring up their children &amp; apprentices in some honest lawful calling, labour or employment, either in husbandry, or some other trade profitable for themselves, and the Common-wealth if they will not or cannot train them up in learning to fit them for higher employments. And if any of the Select men after admonition by them given to such masters of families shall find them still negligent of their duty in the particulars aforementioned, whereby children and servants become rude, stubborn &amp; unruly; the said Select men with the help of two Magistrates, or the next County court for that Shire, shall take such children or apprentices from them &amp; place them with some masters for years (boyes till they come to twenty one, and girls eighteen years of age compleat) which will more strictly look unto, and force them to submit unto government according to the rules of this order, if by fair means and former instructions they will not be drawn into it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Text of the Massachusetts General School Law of 1647==

&lt;blockquote&gt;It being one chief project of that old deluder, Satan, to keep men from the knowledge of the Scriptures, as in former times by keeping them in an unknown tongue, so in these latter times by persuading from the use of tongues, that so that at least the true sense and meaning of the original might be clouded and corrupted with love and false glosses of saint-seeming deceivers; and to the end that learning may not be buried in the grave of our forefathers, in church and commonwealth, the Lord assisting our endeavors. 
It is therefore ordered that every township in this jurisdiction, after the Lord hath increased them to fifty households shall forthwith appoint one within their town to teach all such children as shall resort to him to write and read, whose wages shall be paid either by the parents or masters of such children, or by the inhabitants in general, by way of supply, as the major part of those that order the prudentials of the town shall appoint; provided those that send their children be not oppressed by paying much more than they can have them taught for in other towns. 

And it is further ordered, that when any town shall increase to the number of one hundred families or householders, they shall set up a grammar school, the master thereof being able to instruct youth so far as they may be fitted for the university, provided that if any town neglect the performance hereof above one year that every such town shall pay 5 pounds to the next school till they shall perform this order. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6955">'''Modern studies''' is a subject unique to the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Scottish secondary school curriculum|secondary school curriculum]]. The focus of Modern Studies is to develop learners' knowledge and understanding of contemporary political and social issues in local, Scottish, United Kingdom and international contexts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/45629.html|title=SQA|last=resources@sqa.org.uk|first=Scottish Qualifications Authority, Resource Management,|website=www.sqa.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Studies is offered both at National Qualification level and also in the Broad General Education stage of Scottish education. Pupils in primary school and up to S3 in secondary school have the opportunity to study Modern Studies concepts through the 'People in Society, Economy and Business' area of the broader Social Studies Curriculum for Excellence experiences and outcomes. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.education.gov.scot/Documents/social-studies-eo.pdf|title=Social Studies Experiences and Outcomes|last=|first=|date=|website=Education Scotland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Senior Phase, Modern Studies is offered as a discrete subject. Ray Gunnion, history teacher in Brannock High School until 2004, was largely involved in introducing Modern Studies into the Scottish Education system as he felt it was a valuable subject for kids in Scotland.

== The Value of a Modern Studies Course ==
Modern Studies helps you develop knowledge and understanding of the processes that determine political, social and economic life. These processes are studied locally, nationally and internationally.

Modern Studies helps you develop important skills. For example you will become better at critically evaluating information, analysing complex sources and report writing. In some instances, the skills involved in using information technology will also be developed.

Together, the knowledge you acquire and the skills you develop will allow you to become a more informed individual, able to participate more effectively in society in a more tolerant and responsible manner.

== Study Themes ==
Common study themes exist across Modern Studies qualifications, from Broad General Education to Senior Phase.

=== Democracy in the UK ===
Pupils are given the opportunity to learn about the democratic processes of the United Kingdom with a focus on either UK democracy or Scottish democracy.  This includes examining rights and responsibilities, the political process, participation and representation at various levels.

=== Social Issues ===
Pupils examine social issues in society using sociological processes.  The focus of this unit is either Social Inequality or Crime and the Law.

A focus on social inequalities would examine issues of health, education, income and wealth inequalities in the UK by studying selected groups such as the unemployed, working poor, women, children, the elderly, [[LGBT|LBGT]]* people, [[Black and Minority Ethnic|BME]] people and others.

A focus on Crime and the Law would explore the types of crime committed in the UK, the sociological and individualistic theories of the causes of crime, the impact of crime and attempts to tackle crime.  The unit would examine the role of the criminal justice system, the police and the government.

=== International Issues ===
The International Issues unit is intended to broaden the scope of pupils' experiences to international contexts.  The focus of this unit will examine either a World Power or a World Issue.

A focus on a World Power will consist of a socioeconomic and political study of a [[G20]] country (excluding the United Kingdom).  This focus will be on the country's constitutional arrangements and opportunities for participation, the nature of recent socioeconomic issues and attempts to revolve them and the international influence of the world power.

A focus on a World Issue would put in the spotlight a contemporary significant conflict or issue which extends beyond the borders of a single country and has had impacts regionally or globally.  Examples of areas of study in this area would be [[terrorism]] or the [[Syrian Civil War]].  A study of a world issue would focus on the causes of, the impacts of and attempts to resolve the issue.

==The Primary Curriculum==

All schools in Scotland follow the 3-18 Curriculum for Excellence. Modern Studies is not offered as a discrete subject at primary school level, rather, it is delivered within the integrated Social Studies curricular area (which also encompasses history and geography themes).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the early, first and second stages (P1-P7); pupils are introduced to social studies key themes and are encouraged to develop analytical and evaluative skills.

==In S1, S2 &amp; S3==
Each school has the freedom to develop a course to suit the needs and interests of both pupils and teachers within the parameters of the Social Studies Experiences and Outcomes.

==National Qualifications==
Modern Studies is offered at National 3, 4 &amp; 5 levels and at Higher and Advanced Higher.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is scope for a great deal of personalisation and choice across the NQ levels within the Course Assessment Specification. There are three areas of study and within these areas, teachers have the opportunity to teach a number of combinations of topic; these are:
* Democracy in Scotland and the UK:
** Democracy in Scotland OR
** Democracy in the United Kingdom
* Social Issues
** Social Inequality OR
** Crime and the Law
* International Issues
** World Power OR
** World Issue
At Advanced Higher level, there is a greater emphasis on depth of knowledge and so, one area of study is chosen from: Political Issues OR Law and Order OR Social Inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Studies Advanced Higher Course Assessment Specification|last=|first=|publisher=SQA|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At each level above National 3, there also exists the requirement for pupils to complete an independent research project under the supervision of their teacher.  This project makes up some of the final overall award.

==University==

Modern Studies does not exist as a separate subject at [[University]] level though it is a sound basis for further study of a range of subjects from which Modern Studies is composed, such as Crime and the Law, [[Politics]], [[International Relations]], [[Sociology]], [[Criminology]], [[Economics]], [[Social Policy]] and [[Public Policy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2170">'''Moonlighter Presents''' is a lecture series based in Brooklyn, New York dedicated to non-expertise and the art of public speaking. Founded in September 2010, the series evolved as a reaction to the increased emphasis on professionalization in academia and the art world. Event organizers invite scholars and professionals  to address topics outside their fields of expertise or consider their work from unusual perspectives.  There are no topics or themes. Participants are free to invent roles for themselves and to tamper with traditional lecture formatting. Lectures have, for the most part, been held in an old funeral home in Williamsburg. They have also taken place in other non-traditional speaking venues, such as a former Catholic high school in Soho, a bar in Greenpoint, and a corporate office space in Manhattan.

The series has received wide and positive support from the ''New York Times'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/06/arts/secret-science-club-nerd-nite-and-other-barroom-education.html?pagewanted=3&amp;ref=arts&amp;src=me&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://newyork.timeout.com/things-to-do/this-week-in-new-york/1556517/moonlighter-presents&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bookforum]]'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bookforum.com/events/location=3102&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Bustler''. Caitlin Blanchfield, writing for ''Urban Omnibus'', highlighted the uniqueness of the series' anti-curatorial platform:&lt;ref&gt;http://urbanomnibus.net/2011/02/moonlighter-presents-bjarke-ingels-neil-freeman-and-anthony-graves/&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The series is principally organized by Stephanie DeGooyer and Justin Martin. Previous speakers have included:  [[Bjarke Ingels]], Anthony Graves, Peter Coviello,  Alexander Nagel, Myranda Gilles,  Emily Votruba, Cecily Swanson, Kate Perkins,  Ian Balfour,  Sukjong Hong,  Maegan Magathan, Dan Fox,  Molly Kleinmen, Sam Frank, Tyler Rowland, Seppe Kuehn, and Daniel Denvir, among others.

[[File:Earth in nights.jpg|thumb|Composite image of the Earth's visible light pollution]]
'''National Dark-Sky Week''' ('''NDSW'''), held during the week of the [[new moon]] in April,&lt;ref name=WG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-national-dark-sky-week.htm |title=What Is National Dark Sky Week? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Wise Geek |publisher=Conjecture Corporation |accessdate=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a week during which people worldwide turn out their lights in order to observe the beauty of the [[night sky]] without [[light pollution]]. This event was founded in 2003 by high school student Jennifer Barlow of [[Midlothian, Virginia]] and its popularity and participation increases every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jennifer Barlow: Dark-sky Devotee - Sky &amp; Telescope|url = http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/jennifer-barlow-dark-sky-devotee/|website = Sky &amp; Telescope|accessdate = 2015-12-06|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been endorsed by the [[International Dark-Sky Association]] (IDA), the [[American Astronomical Society]] (AAS), the [[Astronomical League]], and ''[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]'' (''S&amp;T'').&lt;ref name="S&amp;T"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/resources/darksky/3307451.html |title=Jennifer Barlow: Dark-sky Devotee |last=Bobra |first=Monica |work=[[Sky &amp; Telescope]] |publisher=Sky Publishing of New Track Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goal==
The goals of the event are to:
* Temporarily reduce light pollution and raise awareness about its effects on the night sky,
* Encourage the use of better lighting systems that direct light downward instead of into the sky, and
* Promote the study of [[astronomy]].

This event always occurs in April, during the week of the new moon so that the sky can be as dark as possible for optimum viewing conditions.

Jennifer Barlow states, "The night sky is a gift of such tremendous beauty that should not be hidden under a blanket of wasted light. It should be visible so that future generations do not lose touch with the wonder of our [[universe]]." Barlow explains, "It is my wish that people see the night sky in all of its glory, without excess light in the sky as our ancestors saw it hundreds of years ago."&lt;ref name="S&amp;T"/&gt;

==Participation==
Willing participants in this project turn off all unnecessary lighting indoors and outdoors sources in order to reduce light pollution of the night sky.

The International Dark-sky Association encourages light
users to take precautions against outdoor light pollution by:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Outdoor Lighting Basics|url = http://darksky.org/lighting/lighting-basics/|website = International Dark-Sky Association|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Using outdoor light only when needed
*Confine light to specific areas 
*Beware that lights are only as bright as it is necessary
*Reducing the amount of [[Visible spectrum|blue light]] emissions used
*Use of lighting that faces downward, in order to avoid over illumination, called [[fully shielded fixtures]]

==Types of light pollution==
[[Light pollution]] is a broad term used to define excess artificial light that brightens the night sky. Types of light pollution which include:
* [[Skyglow]], a hazy glow produced by the reflection water molecules in the air that encompasses cities which prevent the night sky to be fully seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is sky glow? {{!}} Light Pollution {{!}} Lighting Answers {{!}} NLPIP|url = http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/nlpip/lightinganswers/lightpollution/skyGlow.asp|website = www.lrc.rpi.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Light trespass]] is a condition in which light is oriented into areas in which it is not needed. A common example is street lighting projecting in all directions including the sky which creates a hazy reflection upon the night sky, making it difficult for star observation.&lt;ref name="physics.fau.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Light Pollution Impacts Animals and Environment|url = http://physics.fau.edu/observatory/lightpol-environ.html|website = physics.fau.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Over-illumination]] is the excess supply of light used beyond what is necessary for safety and efficiency. 
* [[Light clutter]] which refers to the common organizational groupings of lights in cities and roadways. 
* [[Glare (vision)|Glare]] is an impeding bright light which cause temporary impairments to human sight. There are three classifications of glare, blinding glare, disability glare and discomfort glare. (See [[Light pollution]])

==Implications of light pollution==
[[Light pollution]] is the adverse effects of artificial light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Light Pollution Impacts Animals and Environment|url = http://physics.fau.edu/observatory/lightpol-environ.html|website = physics.fau.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Affected parties of light pollution include:&lt;ref name="Chepesiuk A20-A27"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Missing the Dark: Health Effects of Light Pollution|journal = Environmental Health Perspectives|date = 2009-01-01|issn = 0091-6765|pmc = 2627884|pmid = 19165374|pages = A20-A27|volume = 117|issue = 1|first = Ron|last = Chepesiuk|doi=10.1289/ehp.117-a20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Astronomers:'''

By increasing the number of participants, the quality of viewing the sky and stars will be temporarily improved. This is a benefit to astronomers that are faced with light pollution issues such as [[light trespass]] and [[skyglow]].&lt;ref name="physics.fau.edu"/&gt;

'''Nocturnal wildlife:'''&lt;br&gt;Several animal species have been documented to be affected by light pollution. The glare of street lights cause distraction to nocturnal birds in flight leading to bird crashes into sky scrapers and buildings. The use of light may also cause birds to reproduce or migrate too early. The feeding behavior of insects, bats, sea turtles, fish, replies reflect alterations by artificial light. Sea turtles mistake the glow of electric lights for the shimmer of the ocean, leading them to flock outside of their nest into hazardous areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Light Pollution Effects on Wildlife and Ecosystems|url = http://darksky.org/light-pollution/wildlife/|website = International Dark-Sky Association|accessdate = 2015-12-07|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human circadian rhythm and sleep patterns:'''

Exposure to light during traditional sleeping hours have are
documented to cause disruptions in the circadian rhythm that regulate human
sleep cycles.&lt;ref name="Chepesiuk A20-A27"/&gt; Biologists have noted a decrease in the amount of [[melatonin]], a natural hormone that regulates the [[Circadian rhythm]], in humans that are exposed to light pollution of the night sky.&lt;ref name="Human Health"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Human Health|url = http://darksky.org/light-pollution/human-health/|website = International Dark-Sky Association|accessdate = 2015-12-07|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prevent major impact, biologists suggest to increase the amount of natural light exposure during the day and decrease the amount of electrical light consumed at night.&lt;ref name="Human Health"/&gt;

'''Growth patterns of plants and trees:'''

The growing pattern of trees have been disrupted and less adjusted to seasonal
changes in weather and light exposure.&lt;ref name="Chepesiuk A20-A27"/&gt;

'''Waste of economic resources:'''

Leaving lights on that are not in use can lead to the waste of economic cost expenditures. Conservation and efficiency is necessary for environmental responsibility.&lt;ref name="Chepesiuk A20-A27" /&gt; The invention of LED lights, dimmers, motion sensors and times have reduced the amount of energy used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Light Pollution Wastes Energy and Money|url = http://darksky.org/light-pollution/energy-waste/|website = International Dark-Sky Association|accessdate = 2015-12-07|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
The best way to take action to promote dark skies is to get involved in local government. There are templates for [[light ordinances]] that can legally ban the use of harmful lights and limit commercial lighting to a specific curfew. Currently, there are no nationwide standards regarding light pollution. However, select cities across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] are taking initiative to facilitate dark sky cities in order to reduce light pollution and view the night sky within city limits.

'''National Simultaneous Storytime''' is an annual event held since 2000 by the [[Australian Library and Information Association]]. Every year a picture book, by an Australian children's author and illustrator is read simultaneously in libraries, schools, pre-schools, childcare centres, family homes and bookshops around Australia, as part of Australia's [[National Library Week|Library and Information Week]]. In 2018 over 1,062,230 participants at over 8,255 locations across Australia took part in National Simultaneous Storytime.

== History ==
The idea for a national simultaneous event followed a successful Statewide Storytime programme in Victoria in 2000.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/inCiteALIA/2001/19.html|title=National simultaneous storytime [2001] inCite 19; 22(1–2)|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2002 – 2007 NSS took place during National Literacy and Numeracy Week in September. In 2008 it returned to being celebrated on the Wednesday of Australia's [[National Library Week|Library and Information Week]] at the end of May.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ourstorycoffslibrary.info/story/national-simultaneous-storytime/|title=National Simultaneous Storytime {{!}} 50 years 50 stories|website=ourstorycoffslibrary.info|access-date=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 over 500,000 children at over 3,100 locations across Australia took part in National Simultaneous Storytime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.alia.org.au/national-simultaneous-storytime-wrap-2015|title=National Simultaneous Storytime Wrap Up 2015|last=|first=|date=|work=National Simultaneous Storytime|accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Our Mr. Sun''''' is a one-hour American 1956 [[television film]] in [[Technicolor]] written, produced, and directed by [[Frank Capra]]. It is a [[Documentary film|documentary]] that explains how the Sun works and how it also plays a huge part in human life. It was first televised by [[CBS]] in 1956.

The film starred [[Frank C. Baxter|Frank Baxter]] as "Dr. Research", and [[Eddie Albert]] as "the writer", the other recurring character in [[The Bell Laboratory Science Series]].&lt;ref name="Templeton" /&gt; [[Marvin Miller (actor)|Marvin Miller]] voiced the animated sun. [[Sterling Holloway]], who was uncredited, voiced an animated version of [[chlorophyll]]. The film marked the last project of [[Lionel Barrymore]], who played the voice of [[Father Time]].&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt; It was first shown on television two years after Barrymore's death.

''Our Mr. Sun'', and a companion film ''[[Hemo the Magnificent]]'' (about [[blood]] circulation), were popular favorites for showing in school science classrooms. The film is currently packaged on DVD with another Frank C. Baxter film ''[[The Bell Laboratory Science Series#The Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays (1957)|The Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays]] (1957).

==Synopsis==
The film opens with Dr. Research ([[Frank C. Baxter|Dr. Frank C. Baxter]]) and the Writer ([[Eddie Albert]]) meeting Father Time ([[Lionel Barrymore]]) and Mr. Sun ([[Marvin Miller]]) who explain that time started a few billion years ago and that the Sun is a [[star]]. Mr. Sun explains that he was worshipped as various gods ([[Shamash]], [[Mithra]], [[Ra]] and [[Apollo]]) until [[Anaxagoras]] proclaimed the Sun was a very hot stone and not a god. Logic and reasoning were the beginning of the end of worshiping the Sun as [[algebra]] and the [[astrolabe]] were used to study the heavens.

Dr. Research explains that the [[Sun]] is 93 million miles away and its light takes 8 minutes to reach the earth. Light from the next closest star, [[Alpha Centauri]], takes more than 4 years to get to us at a speed greater  than 186,000 miles per second. The sun weighs the same as 330,000 earths and is 95% [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] gas and not solid. The Sun is compressed by [[gravity]] so tightly that the gas at the center is more than 100 times heavier than water with a pressure of one billion tons per square inch while the surface is about one pound per square inch. The center is 30 million degrees Fahrenheit while the surface is only 10,000 degrees, but the [[corona]] is 1 million degrees Fahrenheit though [[Coronal heating problem|nobody knows why]], so scientists study the corona during each [[solar eclipse]].

[[George Ellery Hale|Dr. George Ellery Hale]] and [[Henri-Alexandre Deslandres|Dr. Henri Deslandres]] both developed the [[spectroheliograph]]—independently—to study the Sun in different [[wavelength]]s of [[light]] related to specific [[atom]]s. [[Robert R. McMath|Dr. Robert R. McMath]] of the [[McMath–Hulbert Observatory]] used a spectroheliograph to make [[time-lapse photography|time-lapse films]] of the [[solar prominence|prominences]] on the Sun. Using pictures from the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]], and others, scientists have learned about [[sunspots]] first described by [[Galileo]]. Sunspots often appear in pairs and are about 7,000 degrees rather than the normal 10,000 degrees. The spots increase and decrease in a cycle of about 11.2 years. Studying sunspots has shown the equator rotates faster than the poles at around 25 and 1/3 days per rotation. Halfway between the equator and the poles takes about 27 and 1/2 days per rotation though nobody understands why.

[[File:Zonne47kl.jpg|thumb|alt=image of a large arching solar prominence|The Great Eruptive Prominence of 1946 is the largest known. (from June 4, 1946)]]
[[Bernard Lyot|Dr. Bernard Lyot]] developed the first [[coronagraph]] to study the Sun's corona. Improved coronagraphs are used at the [[High Altitude Observatory]] by [[Walter Orr Roberts|Dr. Walter Roberts]] and at the [[Evans Solar Facility]] by [[John Wainwright Evans|Dr. J. W. Evans]]. [[Donald H. Menzel|Dr. Donald H. Menzel]] was the first to use the coronagraph in America. These coronagraphs are used to film structures on the Sun called [[solar prominence|prominences]] and [[spicule (solar physics)|spicules]] which show matter flowing on the surface in structures many times the size of the earth. Often matter appears from nowhere to flow down into a sunspot which is sometimes referred to as [[Coronal Rain]]. The largest recorded prominence was captured at the High Altitude Observatory in Colorado on June 4, 1946 as it left the Sun at 400,000 miles per hour.

The Sun is also studied in [[radio frequencies]] using [[radio astronomy]]. [[Edward George Bowen|Dr. E. G. Bowen]] helped pioneer radio astronomy which showed that many places in outer space emit radio waves.

When [[solar flares]] erupt from sunspots they emit [[ultraviolet radiation]], which reach the earth in 8 minutes, and [[Plasma (physics)|electrified fragments of atoms]] which take around 30 hours. These fragments of atoms are diverted by the [[earth's magnetic field]], towards the North and South poles which causes the [[Aurora (astronomy)|Aurora]]. [[Carl Witz Gartlein|Dr. C. W. Gartlein]] of Cornell University took some of the first motion pictures of the ''Aurora Borealis''. These solar flares cause disruption in [[Power blackout|electricity]] and radio communications because of disturbances of the [[ionosphere]]. Because of this, the Sun is monitored from 22 stations around the world which send data to the [[Radio Storm Warning Service]] of the [[National Bureau of Standards]] to determine when a [[solar flare|solar storm]] will reach the Earth.

The earth receives one billion dollars of [[solar energy]] from the Sun every second when the rate is $0.02 per kilowatt-hour. The earth receives only one two-billionth of the total energy output by the Sun, which is about 500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 [[horsepower]]. The Sun generates this energy through [[thermonuclear reaction]]s roughly equal to 10,000 [[hydrogen bombs]] going off every second and has been doing so for the last 4 billion years. [[Hans Bethe|Dr. Hans Bethe]], in 1938, was the first to determine this fact. Every second, the sun converts 564 million tons of hydrogen into 560 million tons of helium with the remaining 4 million tons being converted into energy in the form of [[light]], [[heat]] and [[radiation]].

''Thermo the Magician'' enters to explain the [[CNO cycle|carbon cycle]] whereby hydrogen atoms are  converted into helium atoms by fusion reactions with [[carbon]] atoms. At 30 million degrees, one hydrogen and one carbon combine into [[nitrogen]]. Adding two hydrogens to the nitrogen creates [[oxygen]]. The oxygen combines with another hydrogen to create helium and carbon, and in the process releases energy. Dr. Research then mentions combining two hydrogen atoms directly into a helium atom in the [[Proton–proton chain reaction|proton-proton process]].

Dr. Research continues, telling how science believes the Sun started as a loose cloud of hydrogen gas compressed by gravity and this compression raised the temperature until it reached 30 million degrees and started the thermonuclear reaction. The nuclear reactions expand the Sun and gravity compresses it until the two forces reach a balance. The Sun has only used small portion of its hydrogen and has about 98% of it left which will take about 50 to 100 billion years until it is gone and the Sun dies.

Science is depending on the Sun for the solution to man's two biggest problems, the first problem being food. The population of the earth went from 500 million in 1650 to 2.5 billion in 1950. One out of every twenty human beings that ever existed, is currently alive today. Two out of every three people don't have enough to eat which is required for good health and 100 million new humans are born each year becoming a [[population explosion]].

Food is grown by the Sun through [[photosynthesis]], which means ''putting together with light''. Ninety-nine percent of all food and fuel is created by the Sun through photosynthesis. [[Chlorophyll]] is the [[molecule]] responsible for photosynthesis though science isn't exactly sire how it works. They believe chlorophyll uses sunlight to combine [[carbon dioxide]] molecules with [[water]] molecules, along with salts, to create sugars and release oxygen. These sugars form the bulk of a plant including its fruit. Most of these plants are grown in the sea as [[phytoplankton]], which is the food source of [[zooplankton]], which are eaten by fish. All animals survive on food created by the Sun through photosynthesis; either directly by eating plants, or indirectly by eating animals that eat plants. The Sun provided the energy for photosynthesis through its light, which was created at the Sun's core. It takes this light 2000 years to make it from the core to the Sun's surface and another eight minutes from the Sun's surface to the earth.

The food problem is being studied by [[Hiroshi Tamiya|Dr. Hiroshi Tamiya]] of the [[Tokugawa Biological Institute]] in his research on [[chlorella]], an algae consisting of [[carbohydrates]], [[fat]]s and 50% [[protein]]. Chlorella can produce about 10 times the edible material, per unit area, as a typical crop.

The second biggest problem man faces is that of [[fuel]]. In 1850, the average American used 400 horsepower-hours of fuel. By 1950, the average American used 10,000 horsepower-hours of fuel. It's estimated that by 1975 an average American will use 20,000 horsepower-hours of fuel. [[Solar energy]] will be a likely solution and research by [[Charles Greeley Abbot|Dr. Charles Greeley Abbot]] produced a [[solar powered engine]]. The French [[Mont-Louis Solar Furnace|solar furnace at Mont-Louis]] is used for high-temperature research of metals. The Indian scientist [[Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar|Dr. S. Bhatnagar]] experimented with solar ovens for cooking food and [[Mária Telkes|Dr. Mária Telkes]] developed a home that used [[Solar heating]] exclusively.

Research is being conducted by [[Lawrence J. Heidt|Dr. Lawrence J. Heidt]] of [[MIT]] using sunlight along with [[perchloric acid]] to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen so that it can be burned to produce energy. The waste product would be water that can be fed back into the system to create a continuous loop powered by solar energy. [[E. I. Rabinowitz|Dr. E. I. Rabinowitz]] developed a [[photogalvanic]] cell using [[thiamine]] and [[iron salts]] while working at MIT.  [[Thermocouples]] and [[phosphorescent]] wallpaper are other possible solutions to certain energy needs. [[Atomic power plant]]s and especially [[breeder reactor]]s can also provide some energy needs. In the end though, solar power will be the only solution on a long-term scale; otherwise society will have to go back to a muscle-powered existence as it was when humans and animals provided the energy to run things.

In a slightly updated version of the film, the "solar battery" is discussed. Based on the work of scientists Daryl Chapin, Calvin Fuller, and Gerald Pearson at Bell Labs, this device can turn sunlight directly into electricity. A cartoon version of Dr. Research dressed as a pastry chef shows how the solar battery can be manufactured by "cooking-up" a wafer of silicon with a boron coating. (This became the predecessor of today's ubiquitous solar cells).

The film ends with Dr. Research and Father Time providing an overview. That human curiosity has helped drive scientific achievements and that it's important to ask questions of both science and religion.

==Cast==
In this first film of the series, there are very few on-screen credits. Eddie Albert, Frank Baxter and Marvin Miller are the only actors credited on-screen. Lionel Barrymore plays Father Time&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Staff" /&gt; and the vast majority of the film focuses on these four actors.

A number of the characters are animated and thus played by voice actors. Mr. Sun and Father time are both animated. Along with these two, Chloro Phyll (played by [[Sterling Holloway]]) and Thermo the Magician have the next biggest parts. Dawn is the last of the animated characters and is a very small part at the beginning of the film where she makes the introduction for Mr. Sun to tell his story.

There is one other on-screen part going to a man throwing his shoe at a radio when the broadcast is interrupted by sunspots. Three other parts in this segment are for the man's wife, radio announcer Sam Johnson and the radio host that introduces him. These last three are voice only parts and not seen on-screen.

The smallest part in the film is Jim, the technician operating the film projector, and is a voice only part with a single line, "Coming up", in response to Dr. Research's request for focus of the film image during the opening sequence of the movie.

==Production==
''Our Mr. Sun'' is the first of nine films in the [[The Bell Laboratory Science Series|Bell science series]]. Production took place over a period of four years&lt;ref name="NEA" /&gt; and was initiated at the behest of [[N. W. Ayer &amp; Son]], who were AT&amp;T's advertising agency at the time.&lt;ref name="Smoodin" /&gt; Working titles for the film included ''The Sun'' and ''Horizons Unlimited'' with ''Our Mr. Sun'' eventually becoming the title.&lt;ref name="McBride" /&gt; A number of well-known scientists provided technical advice during the production of the film, which was later approved by a ''Scientific Advisory
Board''.&lt;ref name="TheScienceteacher" /&gt;

Although color television was introduced in 1953, most television content was still in black and white and the fact that ''Our Mr. Sun'' was produced in color was noted at the time by ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

==Releases==
''Our Mr. Sun'' was first broadcast on [[CBS]], during primetime, on November 19, 1956.&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt; It was later released—free of charge—as a 16&amp;nbsp;mm print to educational institutions and libraries.&lt;ref name="Solomonbook" /&gt; As a result, the film was often shown in school classrooms around the United States.&lt;ref name="Templeton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Staff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Borrelli" /&gt;

Decades later, in the 1980s, the film was released to the home video market on VHS tapes. In 2003, the film was released, along with [[The Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays]], in DVD format by ''Image Entertainment''.&lt;ref name="Borrelli" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solomon" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10945">'''Payment by Results''' (PbR) is a type of [[public policy]] instrument whereby payments are contingent on the independent verification of results. It is being actively promoted by a number of governments{{Which|date=September 2017}} for more effective implementation of domestic policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.openpublicservices.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/OpenPublicServices-WhitePaper.pdf UK Cabinet Office, "Open Public Services - White Paper"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/factsheet/paying-for-success White House Office of Management and Budget, "Paying for Success"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104222124/http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/factsheet/paying-for-success |date=2012-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is also increasing interest in the field of [[international development]], where PBR is often referred to either as 'results-based aid' (where the funding relationship is between a donor and a recipient country) or 'results-based financing' (where the funding relationship is between a developing country government or a [[development agency]], and public or private sector providers). There are also a number of other terms in use which can often lead to confusion and a lack of clarity.&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;[[ESMAP]] (2013).[http://www.esmap.org/node/2866, "Results-Based Financing in the Energy Sector: An Analytical Guide"], p.45. [[The World Bank]], Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt;

PbR instruments have three key features:
* Payments for pre-agreed results
* Recipient discretion over how the results are achieved
* Independent verification as the trigger for disbursement

== Domestic policy ==
There are many cases of PbR models being used to achieve domestic policy goals, in particular the delivery of social or community services, with payments linked to the results a provider achieves, rather than its inputs and processes. The use of PbR models is often promoted as a way to drive service improvements and achieve increased value for money by aligning incentives to desired outcomes.

In practice, a diverse range of PbR models have been implemented by Governments, varying by the degree to which:  

# payments can be based on the achievement of pure outcomes; and
# risk can be transferred away from Government and towards providers. 

The purest form of PbR is '''Payment by Outcomes''', which seeks to maximise payments linked to outcomes. This is where the commissioner (central or local Government) is fully able to contract in terms of the outcomes it wants and to transfer the financial risk of non-delivery to providers. However, commissioners may face a number of challenges that may make a pure Payment by Outcomes approach either impractical or sub-optimal in terms of achieving the aims of PbR models. These challenges largely stem from commissioners’ ability to manage different risks and responsibilities, especially in relation to their understanding of desired outcomes and their measurement. 

Challenges can include outcomes only being delivered beyond the provider or investor’s return horizon, meaning an earlier payment or proxy outcome must be used; having sufficient confidence that the cash savings used to fund the payment of outcomes will ultimately be realised (e.g. that a reduction in re-offending translates to a reduction in prison capacity); finding a contractual solution that ensures transactional costs are reasonable; and determining how far the delivery of outcomes is attributable to the actual intervention rather than other services or background factors. Commissioners may also find providers are reluctant to accept all of the delivery risk (e.g. where there is a dependency on future Government actions or policies) or where Government cannot truly transfer all of the delivery risk.

There are no known cases where all Government services are commissioned out. Furthermore, PbR will not always be the optimal contracting model, especially where in-house delivery is more appropriate, or where greater control is required over the service to be delivered.

===Education===
Payment by results was introduced in the management of British schools in June 1862. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=George|last=Berry|title=Discovering Schools|location=Tring|publisher=Shire Publications|year=1970|isbn=0-85263-091-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leader|newspaper=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=1862-09-30|page=6|issue=24364}}&lt;/ref&gt;   National funding for individual schools, eventually rising to about half, depended in part on the outcomes of examinations of the pupils conducted by school inspectors. The system was deeply unpopular with teachers and led to increased unionisation.  The system was abandoned in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Payment by results: what a great Victorian idea!|url=https://www.tes.com/article.aspx?storycode=6041160|accessdate=4 May 2016|publisher=Times Educational Supplement|date=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Health Service===
A national tariff was introduced to the British [[NHS]] in 1990 and is still in operation in the English NHS.  It is now prescribed in the National Health Service Commissioning Board and Clinical Commissioning Groups (Responsibilities and Standing Rules) Regulations 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Health Service Commissioning Board and Clinical Commissioning Groups (Responsibilities and Standing Rules) Regulations 2012|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/2996/contents/made|website=Legislation. gov UK|publisher=HMG|accessdate=4 January 2017|ref=SI 2012 No. 2996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s, and [[NHS England]] are required to enter into standard “Payment by Results” contracts with providers. Such a contract between an NHS commissioner and a hospital trust is compulsory for all services provided to NHS patients.  [[NHS Improvement]] is required by section 116 of the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]] to produce a National Tariff, which trusts must be paid for all the specified services.  There is provision for an increase to the tariff.  University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust was the first, and so far only one, in July 2015, to get an increase for its services agreed by [[Monitor (NHS)]] because of its "increased costs associated with this trust running health services across multiple sites in rural locations". It is paid more per episode for accident and emergency, surgery, trauma and orthopaedics, paediatrics, women’s health, and non-elective medical conditions. This is expected to increase the trust's income by more than £20 million per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First ever tariff hike agreed for troubled trust|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/hsj-local/acute-trusts/university-hospitals-of-morecambe-bay-nhs-foundation-trust/first-ever-tariff-hike-agreed-for-troubled-trust/5088163.article#.VgPu1OjkJv4|accessdate=24 September 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International development ==
A range of different instruments in the field of international development can be characterized as Payment by Results, many of which seek to provide incentives for the achievement of both outcomes and outputs by [[developing country]] governments, public agencies, commercial operators and [[civil society]] organizations. By linking disbursement to results PBR is an alternative to the majority [[official development assistance]] (ODA), which is generally provided as grants, loans and guarantees, and is therefore disbursed in advance of delivery.

Proponents of PbR argue that this approach is more likely to deliver the desired development objective, with less scope for waste and greater freedom and incentive for the beneficiary to innovate or achieve the desired objective at least cost. Possible criticisms include the need for recipients to obtain pre-financing, the risk of [[unintended consequences]], higher monitoring and verification costs, and the difficulty of setting the incentive at the optimum level (thereby leading to the risk of [[rent-seeking]] behavior).

'''Results-based aid''' is concerned with incentivizing national-level outcomes and involves the linking of ODA (e.g. from bilateral or multilateral development agencies to developing country governments) to verifiable results, such as performance against one or more outcome indicators, or the successful implementation of a government program. Possible outcomes might include number of children passing an exam, an improvement in the infant mortality rate, or the number of people with a defined improvement in access to energy. 

'''[https://energypedia.info/wiki/Results-Based_Financing Results-based financing]''' is concerned with the delivery of national or sub-national outputs, and could be used by developing country governments (national or local), public agencies, or development agencies as incentive for the provision of goods or services, create or expand markets, or stimulate innovation. Possible target outputs might include the number of vaccines administered, the number of teachers that are trained, the number of new electricity connections that are provided in a defined area. Results-based financing includes approaches such as [[Output-Based Aid]] (OBA).

Existing examples of PbR programs include the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid and Results-Based Financing for Health. However, interest in PBR in the international development sector is growing.&lt;ref name="ESMAP" /&gt; The UK [[Department for International Development]] is piloting Cash on Delivery Aid&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgdev.org/section/initiatives/_active/codaid Center for Global Development, "Cash on Delivery: A New Approach to Foreign Aid"]&lt;/ref&gt; (a form of results-based aid) and results-based financing programs in a number of countries,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120608130958/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/pilots-payments-results.pdf DFID, "DFID Pilots on Payment by Results"]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[World Bank]] has recently launched Program-for-Results (PforR),&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/12/15590386/new-instrument-advance-development-effectiveness-program-for-results-financing World Bank, "A new instrument to advance development effectiveness: program-for-results financing"]&lt;/ref&gt; a new results-based lending instrument, and the [[European Union|EU]] is exploring results-based approaches for the aid component of the [[Budget of the European Union|multi-annual financial framework]] from 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4858">The '''QED manifesto''' was a proposal for a computer-based database of all [[mathematics|mathematical]] knowledge, strictly formalized and with all proofs having been [[automated proof checking|checked automatically]]. ([[Q.E.D.]] means {{lang|la|quod erat demonstrandum}} in [[Latin]], meaning "which was to be demonstrated.") 

==Overview==
The idea for the project arose in 1993, mainly under the impetus of [[Robert S. Boyer|Robert Boyer]]. The goals of the project, tentatively named ''QED project'' or ''project QED'', were outlined in the QED manifesto, a document first published in 1994, with input from several researchers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Research/Logic/TypesSS05/Extra/wiedijk_2.pdf The QED Manifesto] in ''Automated Deduction - CADE 12'', Springer-Verlag, Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, Vol. 814, pp. 238-251, 1994. [http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/qed/qed.html HTML version]&lt;/ref&gt; Explicit authorship was deliberately avoided. A dedicated mailing list was created, and two scientific conferences on QED took place, the first one in 1994 at [[Argonne National Laboratories]] and the second in 1995 in [[Warsaw]] organized by the [[Mizar system|Mizar]] group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mizar.org/people/romat/qed95rep.pdf The QED Workshop II report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The project seems to have died in 1996, never having produced more than discussions and plans. In a 2007 paper, Freek Wiedijk identifies two reasons for the failure of the project.&lt;ref&gt;Freek Wiedijk, [http://mizar.org/trybulec65/8.pdf The QED Manifesto Revisited], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In order of importance:
* Very few people are working on formalization of mathematics. There is no compelling application for fully mechanized mathematics.
* [[Formalized mathematics]] does not yet resemble real, traditional mathematics. This is partly due to the complexity of mathematical notation, and partly to the limitations of existing [[Automated theorem prover|theorem provers]] and [[proof assistant]]s; the paper finds that the major contenders, [[Mizar system|Mizar]], [[HOL theorem prover family|HOL]], and [[Coq]], have serious shortcomings in their abilities to express mathematics.

Nonetheless, QED-style projects are regularly proposed, and the [[Mizar system|Mizar]] library has successfully formalized a large portion of undergraduate mathematics. {{As of|2007}} it is the largest such library.&lt;ref&gt;Fairouz Kamareddine, Manuel Maarek, Krzysztof Retel, and J. B. Wells, ''[http://mizar.org/trybulec65/7.pdf Gradual Computerisation/Formalisation of Mathematical Texts into Mizar]''&lt;/ref&gt; Another such project is the [[Metamath]] proof database.

In 2014 the Twenty years of the QED Manifesto&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.ru.nl/qed20/QED-index.html Twenty years of the QED Manifesto workshop]&lt;/ref&gt; workshop was organized as part of the [[Vienna Summer of Logic]].

'''Rah'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tom Meltzer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/mar/28/gap-year-spoof-youtube |title=The gap-year video spoof that went viral &amp;#124; Technology |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2010-03-28|accessdate=2013-09-29 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a pejorative term referring to a stereotypical affluent young [[Social structure of Britain#Upper class|upper class]] or [[Social structure of Britain#Upper middle class|upper-middle class]] person (male or female) in the [[United Kingdom]]. The characteristics of a rah are similar to those of the [[Sloane Ranger]] stereotype also recognised in the UK, though a rah is generally younger, typically around university age (18–25). An important feature of the rah stereotype is the enjoyment of an affluent/party lifestyle with excessive financial assistance from their parents.

The term is possibly an onomatopoeic reference to how those fitting the stereotype are perceived to talk, with the word 'rah' being associated with upper-middle class affluence since at least the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNHia4_HDyc#t=603s |title=The Young Ones (episode 1 series 2) Bambi part 2 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of the stereotype==
Rahs stereotypically study at prestigious institutions such as [[Russell Group]] universities, having previously attended a private boarding or day school, or sometimes a [[grammar school]] or [[faith school]] in an affluent area. Another stereotype is that rahs have taken a [[gap year]], usually in Africa, South America, or South East Asia.

Certain clothing is often associated with rahs; mid-market names such as [[Jack Wills]] are common. For girls, [[pashmina]]s, [[jodhpurs]], [[Ugg boots]] and [[cable knitting|cable-knit]] jumpers combined with scruffy hair arranged in a bun or drastic side partings are common. Boys are stereotyped with [[chinos]], [[board shorts]], [[boat shoes]], and sports team clothing. [[Gilet]]s, quilted jackets, jogging bottoms, sunglasses, and flip-flops are common for both sexes. In colder seasons, [[British country clothing|country attire]] and outdoor wear is popular, especially brands such as [[Hunter Boot]] and [[J. Barbour &amp; Sons]].

[[Rugby union]] is popular for male rahs. Other sports such as [[skiing]], [[Sailing (sport)|sailing]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[cricket]], [[tennis]], [[Rugby Fives|Rugby]] and [[Eton Fives]], [[canoeing]], [[fencing]], [[lacrosse]], [[polo]], [[shooting]] and [[yachting]] are also popular.

==In popular culture==

'''''RollerCoaster Tycoon''''' is a series of [[simulation video game]]s about building and managing an [[amusement park]]. Each game in the series challenges players with open-ended amusement park management and development, and allowing players to construct and customize their own unique [[roller coaster]]s and other [[Amusement ride|thrill rides]].

The [[RollerCoaster Tycoon (video game)|first game]] was created by Scottish [[programmer]] [[Chris Sawyer]], with assistance from various leading figures from the real-world roller coaster and theme park industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chrissawyergames.com/faq3.htm|title=Chris Sawyer Software Development|website=www.chrissawyergames.com|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the series contains three other main games, [[expansion packs]], a number of ports, and a mobile installment. The most recent installment, ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon World]]'', was released in November 2016.

==Main series==
===''RollerCoaster Tycoon''===
{{Main|RollerCoaster Tycoon (video game)}}
''RollerCoaster Tycoon'' was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on 31 March 1999 and was later ported to the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] [[game console]]. The game was developed by [[Chris Sawyer]] and published by [[Hasbro Interactive]].

''RollerCoaster Tycoon'' received two expansion packs: ''Added Attractions'' (released in the U.S. as ''Corkscrew Follies'') in 1999, and ''Loopy Landscapes'' in 2000. Two special editions were released: ''RollerCoaster Tycoon Gold''/''Totally RollerCoaster'' in 2002, which contained the original game, ''Corkscrew Follies'', and ''Loopy Landscapes''; and ''RollerCoaster Tycoon Deluxe'' in 2003, which contained the content in ''Gold'' plus more designs for the different customizable rides. The game was released on Xbox on 23 March 2003.

===''RollerCoaster Tycoon 2''===
{{Main|RollerCoaster Tycoon 2}}
''RollerCoaster Tycoon 2'' was released on 15 October 2002.  The game was developed by [[Chris Sawyer]] and published by [[Infogrames]].

''RollerCoaster Tycoon 2'' has two official expansion packs: ''Wacky Worlds'' and ''Time Twister'', both released in 2003. The ''Combo Park Pack'' edition contains the original game and the ''Wacky Worlds'' expansion. The ''Triple Thrill Pack'' contains the original game and both expansions.

===''RollerCoaster Tycoon 3''===
{{Main|RollerCoaster Tycoon 3}}
''RollerCoaster Tycoon 3'' was released on 26 October 2004 in North America. Although the core features of ''RollerCoaster Tycoon 3'' are based on the previous games, [[Chris Sawyer]], the developer of the first two games, acted only as a consultant. The game was developed by [[Frontier Developments]] instead, and published and advertised by [[Atari]] featuring a completely different structure.

Two expansion packs for ''RollerCoaster Tycoon 3'' were released - ''Soaked!'' and ''Wild!''. A bundle, ''RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Gold'', was also released, including the original game and the ''Soaked!'' expansion pack; this was followed by ''RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Platinum'' (Deluxe for the EU version of the game), including both expansion packs and the original game.  ''RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Platinum'' was released for [[Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]].

===''RollerCoaster Tycoon World''===
{{Main|RollerCoaster Tycoon World}}
''RollerCoaster Tycoon World'' was developed by Nvizzio Creations for Atari and released on 16 November 2016. The installment is different from previous games in that players build coasters with a spline-based system. It also introduced a new "Architect mode" and "safety-rating" options when building coasters. The game is also the first to incorporate the Steam Workshop.

==Spinoffs==
===''RollerCoaster Tycoon 3D''===
{{Main|RollerCoaster Tycoon 3D}}
''RollerCoaster Tycoon 3D'' was released on 16 October 2012. It was developed by [[n-Space]] for the [[Nintendo 3DS]]. While using many assets and engine content from ''Rollercoaster Tycoon 3'', this game reverted to an isometric view and removed features such as adding scenery and pools due to the limitations of the Nintendo 3DS.

===''RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile''===
{{Main|RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile}}
''RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile'' was released on 10 April 2014. The game was initially available for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices. The game was later released for Android devices (OS 4.0.3 and higher) on 18 October 2014. The game was developed by On5 Games without Chris Sawyer's input (other than licensing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pockettactics.com/news/ios-news/chris-sawyer-involvement-rollercoaster-tycoon-4/ | title = Chris Sawyer: "No involvement" in RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 | publisher = Pocket Tactics | date = 19 March 2014 | accessdate = 15 April 2014 | author = Faraday, Owen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer 2016-03-03"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-03-03-a-big-interview-with-chris-sawyer-the-creator-of-rollercoaster-tycoon |title=A big interview with Chris Sawyer, the creator of RollerCoaster Tycoon |last=Yin-Poole |first=Wesley |work=Eurogamer |publisher=dx.net |date=3 March 2016 |accessdate=2 July 2016 |quote="The world of games moved on and I didn't." }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game returns to the isometric view used in the first two games. The game is built on the [[freemium]] model with social media integration.

This installment was universally panned and was criticized due to Chris Sawyer's absence in the making of the game, the heavy use of microtransactions and wait times, which fans state "has ruined the [''RollerCoaster Tycoon''] experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/news/ni56940262/|title=Micro-Transactions Make RollerCoaster Tycoon Fans Angry|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mygaming.co.za/news/news/62650-rollercoaster-tycoon-4-mobile-sparks-fan-outrage.html | title=RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile sparks fan outrage | publisher=MyGaming | date=18 March 2014 | accessdate=2 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Mobile''===
Released in August 2015, ''RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Mobile'' is an iOS version of ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 3]]'', released by Frontier and is almost an exact clone of the original game (tutorial mode, original 18 scenarios for career, and a sandbox).

===''RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic''===
{{Main|RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic}}
On 22 December 2016 a modified port of both ''RollerCoaster Tycoon'' and ''RollerCoaster Tycoon 2'' was released for iOS and Android, featuring a single price point for the majority of content and in-app purchase for Expansion Pack content (primarily the two expansion packs from ''RollerCoaster Tycoon 2'', and an editor pack that allows users to create custom scenario and import and export these to the Windows version of ''Roller Coaster Tycoon 2'', and replicating the majority of the gameplay from the original games in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/12/21/atari-brings-rct2-inspired-roller-coaster-tycoon-classic-android-5-99/ | title = Atari brings RCT2 inspired Roller Coaster Tycoon class to Android for $5.99 | publisher = Android Police | date = 21 December 2016 | accessdate = 22 December 2016 | author = Davenport,Corbin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2016/12/22/rollercoaster-tycoon-classic-ios-android/| title = Classic 'RollerCoaster Tycoon' comes to iOS and Android | first = Aaron | last = Souppouris | date = 22 December 2016 | accessdate = 22 December 2016 | work = [[Engadget]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''RollerCoaster Tycoon Touch''===
First released for [[iOS]] devices in December 2016, ''RollerCoaster Tycoon Touch'' is a [[free-to-play]] mobile port of ''RollerCoaster Tycoon World''. Like ''RollerCoaster Tycoon 4'', it contains in-app purchases and wait times, but expands upon the [[social media]] integration. An [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version was released in April 2017. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://toucharcade.com/2017/02/23/rollercoaster-tycoon-touch-now-available-worldwide/| title = rollercoaster tycoon touch announced | first = Aaron | last = Souppouris | date = 22 December 2016 | accessdate = 22 December 2016 | work = [[Engadget]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, items based on the [[Barbie doll]] brand were added to the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cowley|first1=Ric|title=Atari partners with Mattel to bring Barbie-branded content to RollerCoaster Tycoon Touch|url=http://www.pocketgamer.biz/news/66827/rollercoaster-tycoon-touch-barbie-partnership/|accessdate=2 January 2018|work=pocketgamer.biz|date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''RollerCoaster Tycoon Adventures''===
''RollerCoaster Tycoon Adventures'' is a [[Nintendo Switch]] adaption of the ''RollerCoaster Tycoon Touch'' game, expected for release in Europe on November 29, 2018 and in North America on December 13, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/rollercoaster-tycoon-adventures-will-hit-europe-next-month-us-in-q1-2019-528423.phtml | title = RollerCoaster Tycoon Adventures will hit Europe next month, US in Q1 2019 | first = Peter  | last = Glagowski | date = October 25, 2018 | accessdate = October 25, 2018 | work =[[Destructoid]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gematsu.com/2018/11/rollercoaster-tycoon-adventures-launches-november-29-in-europe-december-13-in-north-america|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon Adventures launches November 29 in Europe, December 13 in North America|work=Gematsu|accessdate=November 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
In January 2018, Atari Game Partners announced it was seeking [[equity crowdfunding]] via the [[StartEngine]] platform in order to develop a new ''RollerCoaster Tycoon'' game for the [[Nintendo Switch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/313550/Atari_looks_to_equity_crowdfunding_for_RollerCoaster_Tycoon_Switch_release.php | title = Atari looks to equity crowdfunding for RollerCoaster Tycoon Switch release | first = Alissa | last = McAloon | date = 23 January 2018 | accessdate = 23 January 2018 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, Atari announced that the game will be titled ''RollerCoaster Tycoon Adventures'' and is scheduled for release in Autumn 2018.

A game designed for use with the [[PlayStation VR]] platform was announced and released in 2018 titles '' RollerCoaster Tycoon Joyride'', but it was pulled from online stores shortly after release.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Rct2 magicmountain.jpg|thumb|225px|The first two games used this [[isometric projection|isometric]] viewpoint.  Shown is [[X2 (roller coaster)|''X'']] and [[Viper (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|''Viper'']] at [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]] in ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 2]]''.]]

The player is given control over an [[amusement park]] and is tasked with reaching particular goals, such as improving the park's value, attracting more guests, or getting a higher park rating. Some scenarios in the game provide an empty plot of land and allow the player to build a park from scratch, while others provide a ready-built park which usually suffers from deterioration, bad planning, or underdevelopment. The player must wisely invest the limited amount of money provided.

Most scenarios require that the goals be achieved for a specific in-game date, otherwise the scenario is not 'complete'. Completion of scenarios is a prerequisite for unlocking further scenarios in the first ''RollerCoaster Tycoon'' game. In ''RollerCoaster Tycoon 2'', all the scenarios are available for play and the player can complete them in random order.

The player is responsible for building out the park such as raising or lowering terrain, laying out footpaths, adding decorative elements, installing food, restroom, and trash facilities, and building out the rides and attractions. Many of the rides that can be built are roller coasters or variations on that, such as log flumes, water slides and go-kart tracks. The player can build these out with hills, drops, curves, and other features (such as [[Vertical loop|loop-the-loops]] for steel roller coasters), limited only by cost and the geography of the park and other nearby attractions. Stationary rides, such as Ferris wheels, merry-go-rounds, and bumper cars can also be placed. Rides are ranked on scales of excitement, intensity, and [[nausea]], all which influence which park guests will ride those attractions and how they will behave afterward. The player can set the prices for park admission rides and guest amenities. The player is also responsible for hiring park staff to maintain the rides, keep the park clean, and entertain the guests. Players may also invest in 'research', which unlocks new rides and improvements as time goes on, though it costs money to continue research. Research in a particular area is disabled when all attractions in that category are researched.

The guests, who are integral to the gameplay, are treated as separate entities which can each have particular characteristics and be tracked by the player around the park. The game keeps track of how much money they have, what they are carrying, their thoughts, and what their current needs are (thirst, hunger, etc.). Each guest also has some unique features such as preferring gentle rides over roller coasters, and their nausea tolerance. Some scenarios are even biased towards a specific guest demographic and require the player to take this into account in designing the park. In ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 3]]'', the player can create their own guest groups to visit their parks.

Sequels have continually upgraded the number of rides and amount of customization available to the player.

'''Shalva''' (The Israel Association for Care and Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities) ([[Hebrew]]: שַׁלְוָה) is a registered [[non-profit organization]]&lt;ref name="shalva on the Israeli Corporations Authority"&gt;{{cite web|title=Israeli Corporations Authority|url=http://index.justice.gov.il/Units/RasutHataagidim/units/RashamAmutot/services/Pages/amuttview.aspx|website=Israeli Corporations Authority|accessdate=28 January 2015|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; that supports and empowers individuals with [[disabilities]] and their families in [[Israel]]. The organization works with a wide range of individuals with disabilities: [[mental retardation]], [[developmental delays]], [[learning disabilities]], attention deficit disorders, the [[Autism spectrum]], [[special needs]] with recognized [[Disability|handicaps]] (children with minor to severe [[Intellectual disability|retardation]], [[Down syndrome]], [[Fragile X syndrome]]), and more.

Founded by [[Kalman Samuels]] in 1990, the organization offers a range of programs to approximately 2000 individuals with disabilities including [[infants]], [[children]], and [[youth]] and their families. Non-denominational and free of charge, Shalva offers a range of therapies, inclusive educational frameworks, recreational programs, vocational training, respite and family support.  Shalva advocates for the inclusion of persons with disabilities through employment programs, community initiatives, and  disability research.  Shalva collaborates with communities worldwide as well as government, academic, and cultural institutions to pioneer innovative therapy solutions around the common goal of improving the lives of people with disabilities and promoting their inclusion in society.  The organization is supported by a wide network of [[volunteering|volunteers]] from the broader community as well as National Service volunteers. 

Shalva's programs have been distinguished by several awards, among them: the President of Israel Prize for Excellence (1994); the Mayor of Jerusalem Award for Exceptional Service (1999); the Shalem Fund Award for “Israel’s most unique program for the mentally challenged” (2004); the Knesset Speaker’s Quality of Life Prize for Leadership and Public Excellence (2005); the Ruderman Foundation Prize for the integration of children with special needs (2012); and Consultant Status for the United Nations Economic and Social Council (2018).  The organization’s management standards are recognized by the ISO 9001/2001 certification and Midot’s Seal for Outstanding Eﬀectiveness. 
==Background==
As [[parents]] of a child with disabilities,&lt;ref name="Never stop dreaming"&gt;{{cite news|title=Never stop dreaming|url=http://www.cjnews.com/news/%E2%80%98never-stop-dreaming%E2%80%99-says-dad-child-special-needs|accessdate=28 January 2015|work=The Canadian Jewish News|date=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalman and Malki Samuels understood the need for the founding of an organization that would ease the burdens of families of children with disabilities. Their son, Yossi Samuels, was born a healthy child in 1977 however, after receiving a faulty [[DPT vaccine|DPT vaccination]], he was rendered [[blindness|blind]], [[deaf]], and [[hyperactive]]. He was isolated in his own world without a method of communication. Based on their personal experience with the day-to-day challenges of raising a family and the constant need to care for a child with special needs, they decided to establish Shalva in 1990.

The first center was established in a private apartment in the [[Har Nof]] neighborhood in [[Jerusalem]] and catered to a few dozen local children. As a greater need emerged, the organization bought an additional facility on an adjacent street and began expanding its programs; the building was later called ”Beit Nachshon” in memory of [[Nachshon Wachsman]] who was kidnapped and murdered by [[terrorists]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="Esther Wachsman, Mother of slain soldier presents Gilad Shalit with Spirit of Hope Award"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friedson|first1=Felice|title=Esther Wachsman, Mother of slain soldier presents Gilad Shalit with Spirit of Hope Award|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/live_from_the_arab_spring/article/mother_of_slain_soldier_presents_gilad_shalit_with_spirit_of_hope_award|accessdate=30 January 2015|work=Jewish Journal|date=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, programs with innovative therapies were developed for infants, and the organization began to support [[research]] in various subjects in its field.&lt;ref name="Israel joins validation of test to detect Down syndrome"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siegel-Itzkovich|first1=Judy|title=Israel joins validation of test to detect Down syndrome|url=http://www.jpost.com/Health-and-Science/Israel-joins-validation-of-test-to-detect-Down-syndrome|accessdate=30 January 2015|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=March 3, 2012|ref=Israel joins validation of test to detect Down syndrome}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Shalva's programs are housed in the Shalva National Center in the [[Bayit VeGan|Bayit Vegan]] near the [[Shaare Zedek Medical Center]].

'''School-related gender-based violence''' ('''SRGBV''') can be defined as acts or threats of [[Sexual violence|sexual]], [[Violence|physical]] or [[Psychological abuse|psychological violence]] happening in and around schools. This type of violence is due to [[Gender role|gender norms and stereotypes]]. It can include [[verbal abuse]], [[bullying]], [[sexual abuse]], harassment and other types of violence. SRGBV is widely spread around the world and is common in many societies. Millions of children and families suffer from this type of violence. Incidents related to SRGBV has been reported in all countries and regions of the world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002466/246651E.pdf|title=Global guidance on addressing school-related gender-based violence|last=UNESCO and UN Women|first=|publisher=UNESCO and UN Women|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100191-8|location=19, 23-24, 26, 28, 31, 34|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scale ==
Many governments and organizations around the world are working towards getting reliable information regarding SRGBV, as it has been proved to be an urgent matter that should be solved. Based on all the data related to SRGBV around the world collected, it is important to try to find solutions in order to tackle this problematic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For instance, [[UNICEF|UNICEF's]] report ''Hidden in Plain Sight'' included the largest collection of data relating to violence against children. As aforementioned, this report proofs how physical and sexual abuse takes place at schools.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF. 2014. ''Hidden in Plain Sight: A Statistical Analysis of Violence against Children''. New York, UNICEF. http:// les.unicef.org/publications/ les/Hidden_in_plain_sight_statistical_analysis_EN_3_Sept_2014.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; The most common types of abuse include:
* Bullying, with one out of three students between the ages of 13 and 15 worldwide claiming to suffer from this type of violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Sexual violence, with one in 10 girls under 20 experiencing such violence. According to the Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Education Quality (SACMEQ), two out of five school directors in Southern and Eastern Africa recognize sexual harassment happened among pupils of their establishments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO/UNGEI. 2015. ''School-related gender-based violence is preventing the achievement of quality education for all''. Global Monitoring Report Policy Paper 17, March 2015. Paris, UNESCO. http:// unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002321/232107e.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also [[corporal punishment]] at school is considered to be a worrying type of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, M., Robles, O., Stout, K. and Suvilaakso, T. 2013. ''A Girls’ Rights to Learn without Fear: Working to end Gender-Based Violence at School''. Toronto, Plan Canada. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://plan-international.org/about-&lt;/nowiki&gt; plan/resources/publications/campaigns/a-girl2019s-right-to-learn-without-fear/&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty percent of the children population in the world live in countries where protection against corporal punishment is inexistent (at the legal and at the moral level).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Disadvantaged groups are also victims of SRGBV. It has been reported that more than 3000 schoolchildren from Uganda, out of which 24 per cent of girls between 11 and 14 years old suffering from disabilities are victims of sexual violence. 12 per cent of girls who do not suffer from disability are victims of sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Devries, K., Kyegome, N., Zuurmond, M., Parkes, J., Child, J., Walakira, E. and Naker, D. 2014. Violence against primary school children with disabilities in Uganda: a cross-sectional study. ''BMC Public Health'', Vol. 14, p. 1,017.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Gay bashing|Homophobic bullying]] is one of the most common forms of bullying. According to research by [[UNESCO]], more than 60 per cent of [[Intersex and LGBT|LGBTI]] children in Chile, Mexico and Peru were bullied. More than 55 per cent of self-identified LGBTI students in Thailand communicated they were being bullied; in the United Kingdom, over 90 per cent of secondary school students reported homophobic bullying in their schools.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2012a. Good Policy and Practice in HIV and Health Education: Education Sector Responses to Homophobic Bullying, Booklet 8. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; images/0021/002164/216493e.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Several country-based examples, including New Zealand and Norway show that lesbian, gay and bisexual students are three times more likely to be bullied than heterosexual students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2016. ''Out in the open. Education sector responses to violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; images/0024/002447/244756e.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cyberbullying|Cyber-bullying]] is also another issue which needs to be resolved. In the US, the majority of victims suffering from cyber-bullying encounter the same problems at school. They are also bullied within their institutions. Girls are more likely to suffer rom cyber-bullying than boys (Schneider et al., 2012).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, S., O’Donnell, L., Stueve, A. and Coulter, R. 2012. Cyberbullying, School Bullying, and Psychological Distress: A Regional Census of High School Students. ''American Journal of Public Health'', Vol. 102, No. 1, pp. 171–177.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Root causes&amp;nbsp;==
Social beliefs influence gender relations in all countries of the world. In this sense, the root of violence against children depends on social construction and how the populations behave vis-a-vis gender-related issues. Some of the root issues include:
* Gender discriminatory norms: These promote the belief according to which men are more powerful than women and that they can prove their power because they are stronger. In many societies, [[Gender role|dominant gender norms]] prevail and influence people. LGBTI people, who do not follow these gender norms often suffer from violence if they do not comply with these norms. Indeed, many people often consider LGBT people as not "proper" and judge them inciting violence against this group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Use of violence to show power: Authority is often shaped by held beliefs that promote male domination among women. At the school level, this implies male and female teachers are more powerful that children, perpetrating the belief that teachers have power over children. Then, authority is reinforced and maintained.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Other factors include [[Economic inequality|income inequality]], as it is a proof of social constraints.  Moreover, [[social media]], [[Child grooming#Over the Internet|online grooming]] and [[Internet troll|trolling]] – also facilitate violence among children, as this spaces are difficult to track down by the police.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Schools and the education system in general follow a specific social and structural framework. The dynamics of the education sector produce and reproduce environments potentially dangerous for children. It is the system itself which unintentionally exposes children to types of violence that might at times replicate, reinforce or recreate power dynamics followed by the society and the people belonging to this. There are several actors in society who are responsible for participating in and creating these dynamics, including policy-makers, authority figures, teachers, parents, other students and others. In order for these dynamics to change, a lot of effort is required at schools and in society in general.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Consequences ==
Being exposed or having experienced SRGBV can have critical impacts on children's development. Especially in terms of mental and physical well-being, including children's health (HIV and early pregnancy). It has been demonstrated that victims of violence are more likely to accept aggressive types of behaviors or be violent themselves after suffering from violence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Heise, L. 2011. What works to prevent partner violence? London, STRIVE, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://strive.lshtm.ac.uk/system/&lt;/nowiki&gt; les/attachments/What%20works%20to%20 prevent%20partner%20violence.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a vicious circle in which violence becomes wrongly acceptable. SRGBV can have negative and long-term consequences for the future of young people, as it forges their adult personalities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Physical health and health risk behaviour outcomes ===
* Injuries, including bruises, burns, fractures, gun wounds and stabbings
* Lacerations and abrasions
* Disability
* Genital-urinary symptoms
* [[Unintended pregnancy|Unwanted pregnancy]]
* [[Sexually transmitted infection|STIs]] including HIV
* [[Eating disorder]]s
* Substance misuse
* Risky sexual behaviour&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Mental health outcomes ===
* Anxiety
* Depression
* Anger or hostility
* Low self-esteem
* [[Suicidal ideation|Suicide ideation]], attempts and actual [[suicide]]
* Self-harm
* [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]]
* Shame
* [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|Obsessive-compulsive disorder]]
* Dissociation
* Loss of memory&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Educational outcomes ===
* Lack of concentration
* Inability to study
* Falling grades
* Disruption in class
* Non-school attendance
* Dropping out of school&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Challenges of addressing SRGBV ==
Addressing SRGBV raises important challenges and is very complex. The concept is not understood by many and is considered sensitive for many. Actors from the education sector, governments and policy-makers and individuals attending schools face several challenges regarding SRGBV. These include:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Social cultural norms ===
Reporting on SRGBV situations around the world has become especially difficult since social and cultural norms do not promote this practice. Moreover, implicitly they discourage it. Many actors from society including teachers; school directors and policy-makers still avoid talking to children openly about gender; violence and sex. They fear promoting sensitive materials to children because of the taboo present in society. Work, time and patience are required to overcome set-ideas promoted by parents within their communities. It is necessary to start real and honest dialogues with children in order to create guaranty real and long-lasting results.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Gender inequality ===
[[Gender inequality|Gender inequalities]] refer to the devaluation and discrimination of women an girls in a society. This results on giving more power to men and boys, while demeaning women and girls. For instance, a study in Ethiopia highlighted that even though 93 per cent of male students recognized violence against girls to be illegal, about 33 per cent thought it is acceptable for male students to have what they want, and appeal to their charm or force to get. 21 per cent recognized behaving this way.&lt;ref&gt;ActionAid. 2004. ''Stop Violence against Girls in Schools''. London, ActionAid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Capacity constraints ===
Capacity constraints in education systems, are also responsible for slowing down the progress related to preventing SRGBV. One of the most important challenges is the training of teachers with the tools and sensitivity to teach curriculum against violence and promote gender equality. In order for real change to happen, it is necessary to introduce these new tools slowly, analyzing who is the best to communicate these elements and what skills and knowledge are needed. What's more, having enough resources will be very important to implement change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Weak coordination and monitoring mechanisms ===
Another factor that limits the progress related to stopping SRGBV is weak coordination and unreliable monitoring mechanisms. These render difficult the collaboration between ministries of education, police, social services, child protection and more. This is important because if this collaboration is not fluent, it will be difficult to stop SRGBV. A renewal in the organization's cultural landscape will be needed to overcome challenges, including bureaucracy that disrupts the flow of knowledge sharing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Weak service support for victims ===
Limited access to quality services, including child protection an social services among others (often absent) are due to the quality of services. This particularly concerns fragile communities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Lack of governance ===
In the majority of countries, there is currently no legislation that protects children from violence at school, meaning not much can be done when it happens. However, it is the case that some countries have recently introduced legislations specifically for schools. This said, legislation related aspects have become a real challenge. As to stop SRGBV, perpetrators must be punished.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Limited evidence ===
Emerging, but limited, evidence base on what works, although this is an area that is receiving increasing attention. The few evaluations of SRGBV interventions that currently exist vary greatly in methodology, rigour, scale and scope. This makes it difficult to identify best practice and draw conclusions about effective strategies that can be transferred to other settings. There is also a growing body of promising practices and existing knowledge that has not yet been fully documented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Insufficient data and research ===
As previously mentioned, many challenges slow down the reporting and impact on the quality of providing reliable data regarding certain types of violence. This implies data is incomplete in contexts such as sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and disability among others. This is important as all of these contexts are important to fight against SRGBV. According to a recent study by [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], to tackle SRGBV it is necessary to rely on large-scale studies which include findings that can be compared across countries; studies showing different forms of SRGBV, connections between behavior change and a discrepancy between research and practice. It is necessary to invest in strong data management system tools which divide data and will make it easier for people to analyze it.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;RTI International. 2016. ''Literature Review on School-Related Gender-Based Violence: How it is Defined and Studied''. Washington, DC: U.S. Agency for International Development.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Six guiding strategies for national action ==

=== Leadership: Laws, policies and education reform ===
Governments should demonstrate leadership at the national level by:
* developing and implementing laws to protect children from violence, ensuring accountability and treating all children equally
* adopting a comprehensive, multisectoral national policy and action plan to prevent and respond to SRGBV
* strengthening connections between education and child protection policies, procedures and systems
* reforming the education system for an enhanced and holistic response.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Environment: Ensuring schools are safe and supportive ===
In order to render schools safer, it is important to adopt whole-school approaches that will create better environments for children. Also different types of stakeholders at the school level  should become engaged at local communities and government. There are three specific strategies:
* creating safe and welcoming spaces
* ensuring governing bodies and school management send strong messages that SRGBV is not acceptable and is taken seriously
* developing and implementing codes of conduct.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Prevention: Curriculum, teaching and learning ===
At the education sector level, students should be taught in a certain way and certain topics. In order to prevent SRGBV, it is important to: 
* [[curriculum]] approaches that prevent violence and promote gender equality
* training education staff to give them the tools to prevent and respond to SRGBV
* safe spaces where co-curricular interventions can be a useful entry point for addressing SRGBV.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Responses: In and around schools ===
* When SRGBV does occur, there should be clear, safe and accessible procedures and mechanisms in place for reporting incidents, assisting victims and referring cases to the appropriate authorities. Key strategies include:
* providing easily accessible, child-sensitive and confidential reporting mechanisms
* providing counseling and support
* referral to law enforcement and healthcare services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Partnerships: Collaborating with and engaging key stakeholders ===
SRGBV being a very complex issue, it is necessary to involve many and several types of stakeholders. Thus it is about creating partnerships in order to tackle SRGBV:
* coordination/collaboration between key ministries as well as at the district level
* partnerships with teachers’ unions
* participation of girls and boys
* working with families and the wider communities
* engaging civil society organizations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Evidence: Monitoring and evaluation ===
* National action should be informed by research and data on SRGBV, including:
* formative research on SRGBV to inform policy and programme development
* comprehensive national data collection systems
* indicators to track progress
* evaluations to assess impact.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Bos nsw logo.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Board of Studies NSW logo]] --&gt;
The '''School Certificate''' was a qualification issued by the [[Board of Studies, New South Wales]], typically at the end of Year 10. The successful completion of the School Certificate was a requirement for completion of the [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]]. The School Certificate was issued for the last time in 2011. It has been replaced with the RoSA ([[Record of School Achievement]])

==Tests==
To receive the School Certificate, students were required to sit for the School Certificate tests. There were five tests:
*English-literacy
*Mathematics
*Science
*Australian History, Geography, Civics and Citizenship
*Computing Skills

In 2011, the School Certificate commenced from Monday, 7 November to Wednesday, 9 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/events/hsc-sc_key_dates_11.html#2011-SC-key-dates|title=2011 School Certificate Key Dates|publisher=[[Board of Studies]]|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
Each student was required to study English, Mathematics, Science, History, Geography and Australian Civics and Citizenship and [[Personal Development, Health and Physical Education]] (PD/H/PE) every year in Years 7-10. Each course was also supposed to include a degree of computer use, so students became familiar with that technology.

At some time during Years 7-10 students must have studied courses in Creative Arts (Visual Arts and Music), Technology and Applied Studies and a Language Other Than English.

The student may also have completed a number of additional studies (electives). These additional studies were required to be completed in a number of hours, as defined by the Board of Studies. A student had a choice of these additional studies according to the courses which were available at their school. For a complete list see [http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/syllabus_sc/index.html#4_5 here].

==Review and abolition==
In his 1997 report "Shaping their future",  Professor Barry McGaw was highly critical of the School Certificate.  His report noted several deficiencies in the School Certificate, including:

* The lack of preparedness of many students for Year 11 and 12
* The apparent lack of challenge posed by Year 10 studies for more able students
* The ‘low stakes’ nature of the external assessment where students were not accountable for their own individual results
* Perceptions that the timing of external examinations in the middle of Year 10 has lessened the significance of subsequent Year 10 studies
* Concerns about a perceived discontinuity between junior and senior secondary school studies.

Professor McGaw recommended that the School Certificate be abolished and replaced, for students leaving school, with a statement of achievement which would include each student’s results on statewide tests in literacy and numeracy as well as school-based results in all courses completed in Year 10.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [https://www.det.nsw.edu.au/media/downloads/reviews/hscwhite.pdf Securing their Future]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Professor McGaw's recommendations, the New South Wales government remained committed to the School Certificate, though major changes were made to its structure and timing in order to address some of the concerns listed above.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.det.nsw.edu.au/media/downloads/reviews/hscwhite.pdf Securing their Future]&lt;/ref&gt;

The disparity between the recommendations of the McGaw report and the actions taken by the New South Wales government led to frequent rumours and press reports of the ultimate abolition of the School Certificate.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, Linda (2005) [http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/testing-times-school-certificate-faces-axe/2005/08/19/1124435144894.html Testing times: school certificate faces axe] [[The Sydney Morning Herald]], 20 August 2005. Retrieved on 10 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the NSW Government remained committed to the School Certificate for several years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.det.nsw.edu.au/newsroom/yr2007/jan/ontrack.htm NSW Student Assessment on Track and a Model for the Nation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001015344/https://www.det.nsw.edu.au/newsroom/yr2007/jan/ontrack.htm |date=2007-10-01 }} [[New South Wales Department of Education and Training|NSW Dept of Education and Training]], 18 January 2007. Retrieved on 10 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the New South Wales Government asked the Board of Studies to review the School Certificate as part of the changes to the school leaving age in New South Wales and also the development of a national curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.schools.nsw.edu.au/news/announcements/yr2010/may/sc_review.php&lt;/ref&gt; The NSW Government  announced the abolition of the School Certificate after 2011, with students in year 10 that year being the final cohort to sit the external examinations and receive the qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/nsw-axes-outdated-school-certificate-20110804-1ich3.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=4 August 2011 | title=NSW axes outdated School Certificate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''School nursing''', a specialized practice of public health [[nursing]], protects and promotes [[student]] health, facilitates normal development, and advances academic success. School nurses, grounded in ethical and evidence-based practice, are the leaders that bridge health care and education, provide care coordination, advocate for quality student-centered care, and collaborate to design systems that allow individuals and communities to develop their full potentials.&lt;ref name="schoolnursingdefinition"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasn.org/rolecareer|title=NASN {{!}} Role &amp; Career|website=www.nasn.org|access-date=2016-08-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805204829/http://www.nasn.org/RoleCareer|archivedate=5 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Country School- Everyday Life at Baldock County Council School, Baldock, Hertfordshire, England, UK, 1944 D20562.jpg|thumb|right| A school nurse measuring the heights of students in [[Hertfordshire, England|Hertfordshire]]]]

In 1892 [[Amy Hughes (administrator)|Amy Hughes]] was working in [[Bloomsbury Square]] as the Superintendent of Queen's Nurses. She was asked to visit a local elementary school to advise about nutrition. Hughes was surprised to find that the students were suffering with minor ailments that was contributing to school days lost to sickness. Hughes would in time arrange for Queen's nurses to visit schools. She is credited with being the first School Nurse in the UK.&lt;ref name="SchwabGelfman2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nadine Schwab|author2=Mary Gelfman|title=Legal Issues in School Health Services: A Resource for School Administrators, School Attorneys, School Nurses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F8JmObZT0gYC&amp;pg=PA7|date=July 2005|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-35813-7|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statutory provision of school nursing in all schools in the UK arose out of the [[Boer War]]. A large proportion of army volunteers - between 40% and 60% - had been found to be medically unfit for service, so in 1903, the government set up the [[Interdepartmental Committee on Physical Deterioration]] to study the causes. In 1904 the Committee reported back, saying that there was no general health problem, but treatable conditions had been left untreated, meaning that the conditions had worsened to they extent that they became debilitating. The Committee recommended that:
*children have medical inspections in schools
*[[free school meals]] be provided to children from extremely poor families
*mothers be trained in [[child upbringing]]

The government reacted first by passing the 1906 Provision of School Meals Act, which allowed (but did not compel) local authorities to provide school meals, at no cost to the poor, and to raise a tax to pay for this. Then the 1907 Education Act was passed, which established a team of school nurses at every local authority. This was accompanied by the 1907 Medical Inspections Act, which required local authorities to ensure that each child received a total of at least 3 medical inspections during their time at school. Although the Act established clinics within schools to treat anything discovered, parents were expected to pay for the treatment themselves; after 1912 the government made small contributions towards the cost.

In modern times, school nurses are comparable to [[health visitor]]s, but specialise in a school setting, rather than a domestic one. As such they normally take over public health responsibilities for children, from health visitors, once the children are over 5 and start attending school. Like health visitors, they monitor child development, and deliver certain vaccination programmes, as well as instigating the child safeguarding process when they suspect a child is being abused or neglected. Given their physical setting, they are also often called upon to provide first aid, and it is for this that they are most familiar to children.

In the mid to late 20th century, school nurses were often familiar to children as the ''nit nurse'' - a specialist nurse who inspects children's head hair for [[head louse|lice]], and lice-eggs (colloquially known as ''nits''). In 1947, 8% of school children suffered from lice infections, but the use of ''nit nurse''s had managed to reduce that to 3% within a decade. Skin infections of any kind, which were once common, had become a rare phenomena by the end of the century, except those which afflict the soles of the feet. Under the [[Blair Ministry]], ''nit nursing'' came to be seen as not being clinically cost-effective, and nit nursing was gradually withdrawn from schools.

Following the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Cameron Ministry]]'s reorganisation of the [[National Health Service]], School Nurses fall under the general aegis of [[Public Health England]], but are locally commissioned by [[local government in the United Kingdom|local authorities]], who now hold local responsibility for public health. To become qualified Registered School Nurses, ordinary nurses undertake additional training as Specialist Community Public Health Practitioners. They are regulated by the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]].

The '''Secondary Industrial School''' in [[Columbus, Georgia]] is a historic school built in 1906.  It was the first secondary-level industrial/vocational school in the United States:  it "has been called the nation's first public-supported, coeducational industrial high school."&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc/&gt;  Located at 1112 29th St., the building was designed by [[J.W. Golucke &amp; Co.]] in [[Beaux Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]] style.  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;

It has also been known as '''S.I.S.''', as '''Columbus Junior High''', and as '''Jordan Vocational High'''.

It was a project of [[Carleton B.

| accessdate = 2009-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created to be a more open alternative to earlier [[Question-and-answer site|question and answer sites]] such as [[Experts-Exchange]]. The name for the website was chosen by voting in April 2008 by readers of ''Coding Horror'', Atwood's popular programming blog.&lt;ref name="help_name"&gt;{{cite web
| title      = Help Name Our Website
| url        = http://blog.codinghorror.com/help-name-our-website/

The website serves as a platform for users to ask and answer questions, and, through membership and active participation, to vote questions and answers up or down and edit questions and answers in a fashion similar to a [[wiki]] or [[Digg]].&lt;ref name="fashion"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/10/the-gamification.html | work = Coding Horror Blog | author = Jeff Atwood | date= 2008-09-21 | title = The Gamification | accessdate = 2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users of Stack Overflow can earn [[Reputation system|reputation points]] and "badges"; for example, a person is awarded 10 reputation points for receiving an "up" vote on an answer given to a question and 5 points for the "up" vote of a question, and can receive badges for their valued contributions,&lt;ref name="soFAQ"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation | work = Stack Overflow | title = What is reputation? How do I earn (and lose) it? | accessdate = 14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which represents a kind of [[gamification]] of the traditional [[Q&amp;A site]]. Users unlock new privileges with an increase in reputation like the ability to vote, comment, and even edit other people's posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges|title=List of privileges|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All [[user-generated content]] is licensed under a [[CC-BY-SA 3.0|Creative Commons Attribute-ShareAlike]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/StackOverflow.com|title=Case Studies/StackOverflow.com|work=creativecommons.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Closing questions is a main differentiation from [[Yahoo! Answers]] and a way to prevent low quality questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Closing changes: on hold, unclear, too broad, opinion-based, off-topic reasons, bye-bye to Too Localized|url=https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/184154/closing-changes-on-hold-unclear-too-broad-opinion-based-off-topic-reasons|publisher=meta.stackexchange.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism was overhauled in 2013; questions edited after being put "on hold" now appear in a review queue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/06/the-war-of-the-closes/|title=The war of the closes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Atwood stated in 2010 that duplicate questions are not seen as a problem but rather they constitute an advantage if such additional questions drive extra traffic to the site by [[Search engine optimization|multiplying relevant keyword hits in search engines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/dr-strangedupe-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-duplication/|title=Dr. Strangedupe: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying And Love Duplication|work=stackoverflow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018|08}} Stack Overflow has over 9 million registered users,&lt;ref name="soUSERS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stackexchange.com/sites?view=list#users|title=All Sites|last=|first=|date=|work=Stack Overflow|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it exceeded 16 million questions in mid 2018.&lt;ref name="soQUESTIONS_10M"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/302884/10-000-000th-question-is-here|title=10,000,000th question is here!|date=21 August 2015|website=Stack Overflow|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the type of [[tag (metadata)|tags]] assigned to questions, the top eight most discussed topics on the site are: [[JavaScript]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]],  [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[PHP]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[jQuery]] and [[HTML]].&lt;ref name="tags"&gt;{{cite web | work = Stack Overflow | title = Tags | url = https://stackoverflow.com/tags | accessdate = 9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stack Overflow also has a Jobs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Developer Jobs, Programming Jobs &amp; More  - Stack Overflow |url=https://stackoverflow.com/jobs |website=stackoverflow.com|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; section to assist developers in finding their next opportunity.  For employers, Stack Overflow provides tools to brand their business, advertise their openings on the site, and source candidates from Stack Overflow's database of developers who are open to being contacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stack Overflow Business |url=https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/ |website=www.stackoverflowbusiness.com|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The website was created by [[Jeff Atwood]] and [[Joel Spolsky]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="introducing"/&gt;  On 31 July 2008, Jeff Atwood sent out invitations encouraging his subscribers to take part in the private beta of the new website, limiting its use to those willing to test out the new software.  On 15 September 2008 it was announced the public beta version was in session and that the general public was now able to use it to seek assistance on programming related issues. The design of the Stack Overflow logo was decided by a voting process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=J.Atwood &amp; J.Spolsky founding stackoverflow.com -- but we need a logo.|url=http://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/logo-stackoverflow-6774/brief#contest-breadcrumbs|publisher=99Designs.com|accessdate=23 May 2014|date=30 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 May 2010 it was announced that Stack Overflow had raised $6 million in venture capital from a group of investors led by [[Union Square Ventures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ha|first=Anthony|title=Stack Overflow raises $6M to take its Q&amp;A model beyond programming |url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/05/04/stack-overflow-funding/|publisher=VentureBeat|accessdate=23 May 2014|date=4 May 2010|quote=The money we've raised means that, for the next ($6m / monthly burn rate) months, we can take on new projects, hire new people, and build new expert Q&amp;A sites on a wide variety of new topics. Instead of opening sites in exchange for money, we’re about to launch a new, democratic system where anyone can propose a Q&amp;A site, and, if it gets a critical mass of interested people, we'll create it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content criteria ===
Stack Overflow only accepts questions about programming that are tightly focused on a specific problem. Questions of a broader nature–or those inviting answers that are inherently a matter of opinion– are usually rejected by the site's users, and marked as closed. The sister site softwareengineering.stackexchange.com is intended to be a venue for broader queries, e.g. general questions about [[software development]].

=== User suspension ===
In April 2009, Stack Exchange implemented a policy of "timed suspension",&lt;ref name="Stackoverflow Blog"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/a-day-in-the-penalty-box | work = StackOverflow Blog | title = A Day in the Penalty Box| accessdate = 2009-04-06 | first = Jeff | last = Atwood | date = 2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to curtail users who either show "No effort to learn (the community rules) and improve over time" or engage in "disruptive behavior" and become a nuisance. The suspension is accompanied by temporarily setting the user's reputation score at '1' and a notation on the user's profile page indicating the suspension and remaining duration.

== Statistics ==

A 2013 study has found that 75% of users only ask one question, 65% only answer one question, and only 8% of users answer more than 5 questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wang|first=Shaowei|title=An Empirical Study on Developer Interactions in StackOverflow |url=http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/lxjiang/papers/sac13stackoverflow.pdf|publisher=Singapore Management University|author2=David Lo|author3= Lingxiao Jiang|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NeNOY5oR|archivedate=25 February 2014|date=18–22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, 92% of the questions were answered, in a median time of 11 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mamykina|first=Lena|author2=Bella Manoim|author3= Manas Mittal|author4= George Hripcsak|author5= Björn Hartmann|title=Design lessons from the fastest q&amp;a site in the west|journal=CHI '11 Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|year=2011|pages=2857–2866 |doi=10.1145/1978942.1979366 |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern/projects/stackoverflow/|isbn=9781450302289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013, the Stack Exchange network software automatically deletes questions that meet certain criteria, including having no answers in a certain amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/177675|title=Turbocharging the Roomba: solutions for premature deletion|work=stackexchange.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2012, 443,000 of the 1.3M registered users had answered at least one question, and of those, approximately 6,000 (0.46% of the total user count) had earned a reputation score greater than 5000.&lt;ref name="Bosu et al."&gt;{{cite web|last=Bosu|first=Amiangshu|title=Building Reputation in StackOverflow: An Empirical Investigation|url=http://amiangshu.com/papers/msr-challenge-preprint-bosu.pdf|publisher=Department of Computer Science, The University of Alabama|author2=Christopher S. Corley |author3=Dustin Heaton |author4=Debarshi Chatterji |author5=Jeffrey C. Carver |author6=Nicholas A. Kraft |location=Tuscaloosa, AL 35487-0290, USA|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reputation can be gained fastest by answering questions related to tags with lower expertise density, doing so promptly (in particular being the first one to answer a question), being active during off-peak hours, and contributing to diverse areas.&lt;ref name="Bosu et al."/&gt;

In 2016, 1.5 million posts were deleted, of which about 8% were deleted by moderators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What posts get deleted, and why?|url=https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/296608/what-posts-get-deleted-and-why|publisher=Meta.StackOverflow|date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==

Stack Overflow is written in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]&lt;ref name="roadchap"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/10369/which-tools-and-technologies-are-used-to-build-the-stack-exchange-network | title = Which tools and technologies are used to build the Stack Exchange Network? | work = Meta Stack Overflow | publisher = Stack Overflow}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[ASP.NET MVC]] ([[Model-View-Controller]]) framework, and [[Microsoft SQL Server]] for the database&lt;ref name="soStack"&gt;{{cite web | title= What Was Stack Overflow Built With? | url= https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/09/what-was-stack-overflow-built-with/| work= Stack Overflow Blog | author = Jeff Atwood | date= 2008-09-21 | accessdate=2009-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dapper ORM|Dapper]] [[object-relational mapper]] used for data access.&lt;ref name="dapperIntro"&gt;{{cite web | title= How I learned to stop worrying and write my own ORM | url= http://samsaffron.com/archive/2011/03/30/How+I+learned+to+stop+worrying+and+write+my+own+ORM | author = Sam Saffron | date= 2011-03-30 | accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unregistered users have access to most of the site's functionality, while users who sign in can gain access to more functionality, such as asking or answering a question, establishing a profile and being able to earn reputation to allow functionality like re-tagging questions or voting to close a question.

== Reception ==

Stack Overflow has received general praise for its architecture of handling questions and answers as they are regulated by the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/kdd12-qa.pdf |title=Discovering Value from Community Activity on Focused Question Answering Sites: A Case Study of Stack Overflow |last1=Anderson |first1=Ashton |last2=Huttenlocher |first2=Daniel |last3=Kleinberg |first3=Jon |last4=Luskovec |first4=Jure |date=2012 |format=PDF |website=[[Cornell University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its success has often been attributed to self-regulation.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Romanian researcher Bogdan Vasilescu criticized Stack Overflow, saying that its policies discouraged women from being actively involved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bvasiles.github.io/papers/socinfo12.pdf|title=Gender, Representation and Online Participation:A Quantitative Study of StackOverflow|format=PDF|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{why|date=September 2017}} while an editor from [[Medium (website)|Medium]] said it kept maintaining a negative atmosphere for newcomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@johnslegers/the-decline-of-stack-overflow-7cb69faa575d#.ut98fov0z|title=The decline of Stack Overflow}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another report, researchers conducted empirical studies to identify what types of barriers exist for women, as well as men for posting.&lt;ref name="Ford et al."&gt;{{cite web|last=Ford|first=Denae|title=Paradise Unplugged: Identifying Barriers for Female Participation on Stack Overflow |url=https://github.com/alt-code/Research/blob/master/pubs/FSE2016.pdf |publisher=ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering |author2=Justin Smith |author3=Philip J. Guo |author4=Chris Parnin |location= Seattle, WA, USA| year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study suggested that the site encourages one-upmanship, [[Flaming (Internet)|flame-wars]] and down-voting which makes it less likely that female users will participate. It criticised the rewards system and found instances of "gender swapping" with females adopting male or gender-neutral personas and some males masquerading as females thinking that they will not be treated as harshly.

Stack Overflow has been criticized for the proliferation of poor programming and development practices, specifically by encouraging developers to prioritize basic functionality at the expense of other features like security. A study from the University of Maryland found that Android developers that used only Stack Overflow as their programming resource tended to write more insecure code than those who used only the official Android developer documentation from Google.&lt;ref&gt;Y.

A '''study group''' is a small group of people who regularly meet to discuss shared fields of study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/tutors/studygroups/studygroupfaqs/index.html Study Group FAQs] [[Dartmouth College]]&lt;/ref&gt; These groups can be found in [[high school]] and [[college]] setting, within companies, occasionally [[Primary school|primary/junior school]] and sometimes [[Middle school|Middle School]]/Intermediate. Professional advancement organizations also may encourage study groups. Study groups have helped students who have trouble being in a large group setting.

Each group is unique and draws on the backgrounds and abilities of its members to determine the material that will be covered. Often, a leader who is not actively studying the material will direct group activities. Some colleges actively set up study group programs for students to sign up.

Typical college level academic groups include 5-20 students and an administrator or [[tutor]] drawn from the graduate program or an upperclassman. Professional groups are often smaller.

When students study in groups, they can motivate and encourage each other and lessen procrastination. Also, students are able to learn some studying skills and habits by observing others' study skills and they can incorporate it in their studying routine. Teaching concepts and information to others can help be more familiar and master those concepts. In addition, some students might be uncomfortable asking a question in class and they might feel more comfortable asking someone in a small group.It can create a more fun and positive experience for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.angelesinstitute.edu/thenightingale/benefits-of-group-study|title=Benefits of Group Study|last=Ortiz-ortiz|first=Claudia|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fnu.edu/10-reasons-form-study-group/|title=10 Reasons Why You Should Form a Study Group|date=2014-09-05|work=Florida National University|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''TEMPUS''' ('''Trans-European Mobility Programme for University Studies''') program encourages [[Higher education|higher education institutions]] in the [[European Union|EU]] Member States and partner countries to engage in structured cooperation&lt;ref name=TEMPUSIF/&gt; through the establishment of "consortia". The "consortia" implement [[Joint European Projects]] (JEPs) with a clear set of objectives. Such projects may receive financial aid for two or three years. Tempus also provides [[Individual Mobility Grants]] (IMGs) to individuals working in [[Higher Education]] sector to help them work on certain specified activities in other countries.&lt;ref name = "JP"&gt;Syrquin, Ari (16 July 2008).

Retrieved 3 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1 January 2014, Tempus-like activities, namely capacity building activities, have become part of a new cooperation programme called Erasmus+. These activities involve existing Tempus countries, in addition to countries from Latin America, Asia and Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.&lt;ref name = "The future of the Tempus programme"&gt;.

==History==
On January 8, 1842, King Willem II founded the 'Royal Academy for the education of civilian engineers, for serving both nation and industry, and of apprentices for trade'. On June 20, 1864, a Royal Decree was issued, ordering that the Royal Academy in Delft be disbanded in order to make way for a new 'Polytechnic School'. The School went on to educate architects, and engineers in the fields of civil works, shipbuilding, mechanical engineering and mining. STYLOS, the Student Association for architectural students in the faculty, was established in 1894 and is one of the biggest in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wikidelft.nl/index.php?title=De_voorgeschiedenis_van_de_TU_Delft |title=De voorgeschiedenis van de TU Delft |last= |first= |date={{date|22 Feb 2012}} |website=WikiDelft.nl |publisher= |access-date={{date|24 Oct 2017}} |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the faculty of Architecture almost completely burned down in a fire.&lt;ref name="fire"&gt;https://www.tudelft.nl/en/architecture-and-the-built-environment/current/press-information/the-making-of-bk-city/&lt;/ref&gt; The current building is TU Delft's former main building.&lt;ref name "chairjournal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://objectuur.nl/2013/04/29/de-geschiedenis-van-bk-city-in-een-notendop/ |title=De geschiedenis van BK City in een notendop |last=Bais |first=Jorik |date={{date|29 Apr 2013}} |website=objectuur.nl |publisher= |access-date={{date|24 Oct 2017}} |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chair Collection===
The Faculty is home to a famous chair collection. It was originally housed in the old building and it narrowly escaped destruction in the fire in which that building burned down.

The '''University of Ontario Institute of Technology''', commonly referred to as '''UOIT''', is a public research [[university]] located in [[Oshawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada. It was founded in 2002 by the ''University of Ontario Institute of Technology Act, 2002'' passed by the [[Government of Ontario]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_02u08_e.htm|title=University of Ontario Institute of Technology Act, 2002, S.O. 2002, c. 8, Sched. O|work=Ontario.ca|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its first students were accepted in 2003, making it one of Canada's newest universities.
 
UOIT offers a range of [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] programs, and [[Graduate diploma|graduate]] programs in [[science]], [[engineering]], [[health]] and [[information technology]] (IT) from its main campus, co-located with [[Durham College]] on approximately {{convert|400|acre|ha}} of land in the northern part of Oshawa. It operates a secondary campus in [[Downtown Oshawa]] offering programs in [[social science]]s and [[teacher education]].

The enabling legislation of UOIT includes the implementation of a "Technology-Enriched Learning Environment" (TELE), which emphasizes the usage of [[computing]] resources through the student experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadian-universities.net/Universities/University-of-Ontario-Institute-of-Technology.html|title=Profile of University of Ontario Institute of Technology - Ontario, Universities in Canada|website=www.canadian-universities.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty members encourage students to use [[laptop]]s or other [[computing device]]s to complete assignments, perform laboratory research and interact with faculty during lectures. Previously, all undergraduate programs required students to lease a laptop PC from the university as a condition of enrollment, although in recent years, many faculties have adopted a "[[bring your own device]]" approach, accommodating flexibility among users while continuing to provide necessary software and support.&lt;ref name="TeleByod"&gt;{{cite web|title=CHANGES TO THE TELE PROGRAM 2017-18|url=https://itsc.uoit.ca/TELE-PROGRAM/changes-to-the-tele-program-2017-18.php|website=UOIT|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

UOIT was founded in 2002 by the passage of Bill 109, the ''University of Ontario Institute of Technology Act, 2002'', by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario on June 27, 2002. It is a public university emphasizing science and technology, and a part of the Ontario government's initiative to create more spaces in post-secondary institutions for the [[double cohort]]. UOIT's slogan, "Challenge, Innovate, Connect", was unveiled in June 2006.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

UOIT offered graduate and post-graduate programs and research opportunities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the first 947 students in September 2003&lt;ref name="firstclass"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and total enrolment was over 5,000 in the 2007–2008 school year, making it, at the time, the fastest-growing university in Ontario. The student population by 2012 was 9203 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsdurhamregion.com/news/education/article/163025|title=Durham Region Breaking News - Durham Region's Online Newspaper - DurhamRegion.com|website=DurhamRegion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching and research have long been considered the two pillars of the university's endeavour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edumaritime.com/ontario-on/university-of-ontario-institute-of-technology-uoit-at-oshawa-ontario-canada|title=UNIVERSITY OF ONTARIO INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (UOIT) AT OSHAWA, ONTARIO, CANADA|work=EduMaritime.com|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:University of Ontario Institute of Technology Library.jpg|thumb|left|UOIT Library.]]Construction on the university's first buildings began in 2002. Facilities include a library shared with [[Durham College]], buildings for science, business, and IT, and a virtual hospital for nursing students. The Ontario Power Generation Engineering Building opened in September 2006, and the connected Automotive Centre of Excellence (ACE) opened in 2011; this is a multi-level testing and research centre that allows for climatic, durability and life cycle testing. It has a range of testing facilities including a five-storey high [[wind tunnel]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Plans have been announced for the Centre for Cybercrime Research which will be a separate, permanent location on campus and will be dedicated to research and the training of graduate and undergraduate students in various aspects of cybercrime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uoit.ca/EN/main2/about/news_events/news_archives/news_releases/267332/20080319.html UOIT unveils plans for Centre for Cybercrime Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

An expansion to the athletic facilities, funded largely by students, was completed in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campusdaily.dc-uoit.ca/EN/main/feature_stories/archive/2006/139656/20060511.html|title=Campus Athletic Centre expansion well underway|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uoit.ca/EN/main2/about/news_events/news_archives/news_releases/192350/20070912.html UOIT celebrates grand opening of Campus Recreation and Wellness Centre expansion | 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The university has established a downtown campus. It purchased and renovated the Regent Theatre to be used as a lecture theatre during the week and as a community stage on the weekends.  The university renovated the former Alger Press building which opened in January 2011 as the headquarters of the UOIT downtown campus. UOIT has initiated plans to renovate Victoria St. (between King St. and Bond St. and beside Bordessa Hall) into a pedestrian, social and lounge area. The Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities and the Faculty of Education are located downtown.  The residences for UOIT are Simcoe Village and South Village.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Automotive Centre of Excellence===
[[File:General Motors of Canada Automotive Centre of Excellence.jpg|thumb|right|General Motors of Canada Automotive Centre of Excellence]]

The Automotive Centre of Excellence (ACE) is located on the university's north campus location.

It is divided into two sections: a core research facility (CRF) and an integrated research and training facility (IRTF), with a total area of approximately 16,300 square metres.

The CRF has full-size chambers for full climatic, structural durability and life cycle testing including a climatic wind tunnel. In this test chamber, wind speeds can exceed 240 kilometres per hour, temperatures range from -40 to +60&amp;nbsp;°C and relative humidity ranges from 5 to 95 per cent. The climatic wind tunnel has a variable nozzle that can optimize the airflow from 7 to 13 square metres (and larger) allowing for a range of vehicle and test property sizes. Coupled with this feature is a large flexible chassis dynamometer that is integrated into an 11.5-metre turntable, so that vehicles and test properties can be turned into the airstream under full operating conditions to facilitate crosswind development. The large open chamber has a readily reconfigurable solar array that will replicate the effects of the sun and is hydrogen-capable, allowing for alternative fuels and fuel cell development.

The IRTF spans five floors with space for research, education and training. In addition to conventional automotive applications, ACE is suitable for testing alternative fuel, hybrid and electric vehicles. It is large enough to accommodate trucks, tandem drive systems, full coach buses, light rail transit, aerospace, military and agricultural applications, wind turbines and solar panels.

ACE was developed in partnership with UOIT, General Motors of Canada, the Government of Ontario, the Government of Canada and the Partners for the Advancement of Collaborative Engineering Education (PACE). The total cost of the facility was approximately $100 million.

===Energy Systems and Nuclear Science Research Centre===

The Energy Systems and Nuclear Science Research Centre (ERC) is a 9,290-square-metre facility that houses UOIT's unique-in-Canada education programs and research in geothermal, hydraulic, hydrogen, natural gas, nuclear solar and wind energy technologies. The ERC enables research in clean and green energies and technologies, and promotes Canada's entrepreneurial advantage through public-private research and commercialization partnerships.

Undergraduate, graduate and second-career training enrolment of energy scientists and nuclear engineers is projected to climb from 364 students in 2009-2010 to approximately 650 in 2012.  These programs are complemented by Energy and Environmental options in UOIT's Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Science programs.

* The ERC is the result of a joint $45.4-million investment from the federal and provincial governments as part of the Knowledge Infrastructure Program. Full ERC operations commenced with the 2011-2012 academic year;
*     The construction phase of the ERC November 2009 through August 2011 created 225 direct and 315 spinoff jobs;
*     The ERC is home to UOIT's Faculty of Energy Systems and Nuclear Science (FESNS). In addition to providing administrative space and offices for staff and faculty, the ERC features a network of teaching and research labs of various configurations, which support the Cameco Research Chair in Nuclear Fuels and UOIT's membership in the University Network of Excellence in Nuclear Engineering;
*     The four-storey ERC has a glass-covered atrium, a 72-seat lecture theatre, three 50-seat classrooms, two 30-seat tutorial rooms with flexible seating, 12 labs, 11 student-study (breakout) rooms, dedicated working stations for graduate students and offices for faculty and administration;
*     The ERC has indoor connections to the adjacent Faculty of Business and Information Technology building on the second, third and fourth floors;
*     Teaching space within the ERC is equipped with multimedia capabilities that provide opportunities to expand the current roster of programs, allowing for future growth in new energy-related programs, further development of part-time distance learning opportunities and the expansion of the online degree completion option now offered;
*     UOIT's Bachelor of Engineering in Nuclear Engineering program is the first accredited program of its kind in Canada;
*     UOIT's Nuclear Engineering program features the most extensive nuclear power plant computer simulation of any engineering program in Ontario;
*     UOIT is located in Durham Region, which is home to 10 nuclear generating units;
*     FESNS professors Dr. Igor Pioro and Dr. Glenn Harvel are working on creating a fuel-channel conceptual design for a Generation IV Supercritical Water-Cooled Reactor, which will increase the efficiency of current technologies and lower energy production costs; and
*     FESNS has a close relationship with industry partners in provincial, national and international programs including: Atomic Energy of Canada Limited; Bruce Power; Cameco Corporation; Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission; Ontario Power Generation; and SNC–Lavalin.

==History==
[[File:Victoria University plan (14849525480).jpg|thumbnail|The original 1903 plan for Victoria University]]
[[File:Te Toki A Rata Building, Victoria University of Wellington.jpg|thumb|The Te Toki a Rata building was completed in 2017, and houses the School of Biological Sciences]]
Victoria is named after [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], as 1897 was the 60th anniversary of her coronation. There was a dispute initially as to where to site it, and it opened in temporary facilities in Thorndon. It was eventually decided to place it in [[Kelburn, New Zealand|Kelburn]], where it still has its primary campus. This decision was influenced by the [[Wellington Cable Car|Cable Car company]]'s offer of a donation of £1,000 if it were located in Kelburn so that students would patronise the Cable Car from the city.&lt;ref name="bar99-1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Victoria University of Wellington 1899 ~ 1999 A History|last=Barrowman|first=Rachel|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BarVict-c1.html#n25|accessdate=2008-04-14|year=1999|publisher=Victoria University Press|location=Wellington|isbn=0-86473-369-0|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the Company investors like Martin Kennedy were supporters of [[Richard Seddon|Seddon]], who stalled on releasing land on the alternative Mount Cook Gaol site for the university, although this site was widely supported in Wellington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bourke |first= Kevin |title= Kelburn, King Dick and the Kelly Gang: Richard Seddon &amp; Political Patronage |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear=  |year= 2008 |publisher=  Hit or Miss Publishing |location= Wellington |isbn= 978-0-473-13450-1 |oclc= |page= |pages= 81–84 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation stone of the historic [[Hunter Building]] was laid in 1904. The original name was Victoria University College, but on the dissolution of the University of New Zealand in 1961 Victoria or "Vic" became the Victoria University of Wellington, conferring its own degrees.

An extramural branch was founded at [[Palmerston North]] in 1960. It merged with Massey College on 1 January 1963. Having become a branch of Victoria upon the University of New Zealand's 1961 demise, the merged college became [[Massey University]] on 1 January 1964.&lt;ref name="mas07-1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Massey University history|url=http://calendar.massey.ac.nz/information/mu.htm#history|publisher=Massey University|accessdate=2008-04-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080218042620/http://calendar.massey.ac.nz/information/mu.htm#history &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Victoria celebrated the 100th birthday of its first home, the Hunter Building.

Victoria has expanded beyond its original campus in Kelburn, with campuses in [[Te Aro]] (Faculty of Architecture and Design), and Pipitea (opposite [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], housing the Faculty of Law and Victoria Business School). Victoria also hosts the Ferrier Research Institute and the Robinson Research Institute in Lower Hutt, the Coastal Ecology Laboratory in Island Bay and the Miramar Creative Centre, in Park Rd, Miramar.

In 2015, Victoria opened a new campus in Auckland to service the growing demand for its courses and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Victoria University expands its presence in Auckland|url = http://www.victoria.ac.nz/news/2015/04/victoria-university-expands-its-presence-in-auckland|accessdate = 2015-06-17|quote = Victoria University of Wellington is opening expanded premises in Auckland, providing a central city base to service growing demand for its courses and expertise.|date = 16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name change proposal===
In May 2018, it was reported that Victoria was exploring options to simplify its name to ''University of Wellington''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/356400/victoria-university-mulls-name-change|title=Victoria University mulls name change|date=2018-05-01|newspaper=Radio New Zealand|language=English|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vice-Chancellor Grant Guillford said that the university was pursuing a name change in order to reduce confusion overseas, as several other universities also carried the "Victoria" name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/358083/victoria-university-name-causes-issues-for-graduates|title=Victoria University name causes 'issues for graduates'|last=Dreaver|first=Charlie|date=2018-05-24|newspaper=Radio New Zealand|language=English|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 27th July, 2018, the Victoria University of Wellington Council agreed in principle to the name change, as well as replacing the Māori name with ''Te Herenga Waka''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=111080|title=Victoria University agrees to remove “Victoria” from its name|date=2018-07-27|newspaper=Scoop.co.nz|language=English|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 2,000 public submissions on the name change proposal were strongly opposed, 75% were strongly opposed to it. Alumni and students were strongly opposed to the name change, staff gave mixed feedback, while university stakeholders favoured the name change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/366885/victoria-university-name-change-in-sight-despite-opposition|title=Victoria University name change in sight despite opposition|date=2018-09-20|newspaper=Radio New Zealand|language=English|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RNZ 24 Sep 2018"&gt;{{cite news |title=Victoria University council votes in favour of changing name |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/367163/victoria-university-council-votes-in-favour-of-changing-name |accessdate=27 September 2018 |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 24 September 2018, Victoria University's Council voted by a majority of nine to two to change the university's name to the University of Wellington. The Council also voted to adopt the new [[Māori language|Māori name]] of ''Te Herenga Waka.'' The University's Vice-Chancellor Grant Guilford abstained from the vote, citing a conflict of interest. Critics such as Victoria University law professor Geoff McLay criticized the name change for erasing 120 years of history. By contrast, Chancellor Neil Pavious-Smith defended the outcome of the vote as "one decision in a much broader strategy to try and help the university really achieve its potential".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Long |first1=Jessica |title=Wellington's Victoria University votes to change its name to University of Wellington |accessdate=27 September 2018 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |work=''[[The Dominion Post (New Zealand)|The Dominion Post]]'' |date=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RNZ 24 Sep 2018" /&gt; The Council will submit its recommendation to the Minister of Education who will make the final decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.victoria.ac.nz/about/victorias-story/name-simplification|title=Name simplification|newspaper=Victoria University of Wellington|language=English|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RNZ 24 Sep 2018" /&gt;

==General information==

[[File:Hunter Building.jpg|thumb|Victoria University of Wellington's Kelburn Campus: the [[Hunter Building]]]]
[[File:VUW-Kelburn.jpg|thumb|Victoria University of Wellington's Kelburn Campus]]
Its main campus is in Kelburn, a suburb on a hill overlooking the Wellington central business district, where its administration and humanities &amp; social science and science faculties are based. The law and commerce and administration faculties are in the Pipitea Campus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vuw.ac.nz/home/about_victoria/campus_pipitea.html|title=Pipitea campus|first=Victoria University of|last=Wellington|date=10 March 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; near [[New Zealand Parliament Buildings|Parliament Buildings]], which consists of Rutherford House, the restored [[Old Government Buildings, Wellington|Old Government Buildings]], and the West Wing of the [[Wellington Railway Station]]. A smaller campus in Te Aro&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vuw.ac.nz/home/about_victoria/campus_te_aro.html|title=Te Aro Campus|publisher=|access-date=4 October 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004123330/http://www2.vuw.ac.nz/home/about_victoria/campus_te_aro.html|archive-date=4 October 2006|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the base for the architecture and design schools. The newest facility, the [[Victoria University Coastal Ecology Laboratory]] supports research programmes in marine biology and coastal ecology on Wellington's rugged south coast.

Day-to-day governance is in the hands of the University Council, which consists of 20 people: four elected by the Court of Convocation, three elected by the academic staff, one elected by the general staff, two appointed by the student union executive, four appointed by the [[Minister of Education (New Zealand)|Minister of Education]], four selected by the Council itself, and the Vice-Chancellor. The Court of Convocation is composed of all graduates who choose to participate. [[Charles Wilson (librarian)|Charles Wilson]], at the time the chief librarian of the parliamentary library, was a member of the original council and its chairman for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | page  = 520  | editor-last  = Scholefield  | editor-first = Guy Hardy  | editor-link  = Guy Scholefield

For New Zealand residents entry to most courses is open, with a few exceptions. Performance Music requires an audition. There is selection for entry into the second year in degrees such as the LLB, BArch and BDes. BA in criminology and creative writing is also based on selection.

It is one of only three institutions ([[University of Auckland]] and [[Unitec New Zealand|Unitec]] being the others) to offer a degree in architecture in New Zealand.

In conjunction with [[Massey University]] it owns the [[New Zealand School of Music]].

==Coat of arms==
{{Original research|section|date=December 2013}}
'''The blazon for the arms is''': [[Vert (heraldry)|Vert]] on a [[fesse]] [[Engrailed (heraldry)|engrailed]] between three Crowns Or, a Canton Azure charged with four Estoilles Argent.

'''What this means''': The colour of the shield is first described. Vert is green so the shield is green. A fess is a horizontal stripe across the shield and engrailed means the edges of the fess are wavy. The fess is between three crowns and or means gold so the crowns are golden. Conventionally with three objects two are placed above and one below, in this case, the fess. A canton is a square and azure is blue so a blue square is placed on the fess. An estoille is a star and [[argent]] is silver so there are four silver stars on the [[canton (heraldry)|canton]]. These are supposed to represent the [[Southern Cross]].

'''Crest''': The crest sits above the shield and consists of a crown on which sits a [[lion rampant]] (facing left) holding a staff from which flies a banner with the cross of [[Saint George]].

'''Supporters''': These are a lion and a [[Māori people|Māori]] figure.

'''Motto''': "Sapientia magis auro desideranda" which may be translated as "Wisdom is more to be desired than gold".

'''The modern depiction''': The Coat of Arms has been redesigned as a [[corporate logo]] and is depicted in monotone only and usually in green. The crest and scroll with the motto have disappeared and what was left has been stylised rather than being depicted in the traditional heraldic manner.

== Library ==
The library was established in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/library/index.html|title=The Library - Te Pātaka Kōrero|publisher=|accessdate=2015-06-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603084148/http://www.victoria.ac.nz/library/index.html|archive-date=3 June 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collections are dispersed over four locations: Kelburn Library, Law Library, Architecture and Design Library and Commerce Library. The library is also has a collection of digital resources and acquires full text material online. In addition to electronic resources, printed books and journals, the Library also acquires works in microform, sound recordings, videos and other media consistent with the University's academic programme needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Collection Development and Management {{!}} library.victoria.ac.nz|url = http://library.victoria.ac.nz/library-v2/collections/collection-policy/collection-development-and-management|website = library.victoria.ac.nz|accessdate = 2015-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The library holds approximately 1.3&amp;nbsp;million printed volumes. It provides access to 70,000 print and electronic periodical titles and 200,000 e-books. It is an official Depository Library (DL-296) of the [[United Nations System]] (DEPOLIB), one of only three in the country. The [[J. C. Beaglehole]] Room is the official repository of all archival and manuscript material, and provides a supervised research service for Rare Books, for fine or fragile print items, and for 'last resort' copies of University publications.

The [[New Zealand Electronic Text Centre]] (NZETC) is a digital library of significant New Zealand and Pacific Island texts and materials, and is arranged according to the library of Congress classification system. The library has two online repositories: the ResearchArchive is its open research repository, which makes the university's research freely available online and the RestrictedArchive, which is the university's private research repository and is accessible only to Victoria University staff and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Local Digital Collections {{!}} library.victoria.ac.nz|url = http://library.victoria.ac.nz/library-v2/collections/local-digital-collections|website = library.victoria.ac.nz|accessdate = 2015-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between April 2003 and February 2010 the library was home to two locally famous residents, Tessa Brown and Sandy Rankine, a pair of library cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Fundraiser for sick library cat {{!}} Otago Daily Times Online News : Otago, South Island, New Zealand &amp; International News|url = http://www.odt.co.nz/news/national/58503/fundraiser-sick-library-cat|website = [[Otago Daily Times]]|accessdate = 2015-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 a Facebook page that is associated with Victoria University of Wellington students, [https://www.facebook.com/groups/overheardvic/ ''Overheard @ Vic''], was in the media for the many rape comments that were made.&lt;ref name="Kavanagh-Hall"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/local-papers/the-wellingtonian/7860178/Rape-Crisis-appalled-by-sick-jokes|title=Rape Crisis appalled by 'sick jokes'|last=Kavanagh-Hall|first=Erin|date=2012-10-25|newspaper=Stuff.co.nz|language=English|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included comments like "you've got to rape the paper, man, you can't let the paper rape you" and "at least ugly girls don't get raped".&lt;ref name="Kavanagh-Hall"/&gt; In response to this, a spokesperson for Victoria University of Wellington said that "student safety was a key focus, and the university had partnered with police and Wellington City Council to promote awareness of personal safety".&lt;ref name="Kavanagh-Hall"/&gt;

In 2010 there was widespread condemnation of Victoria University of Wellington removing the Gender Studies department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/4407891/Axing-gender-studies-setback-to-rights|title=Axing gender studies 'setback to rights'|last=Fisher|first=Amanda|date=2010-12-01|newspaper=Stuff.co.nz|language=English|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, a minor in Gender Studies was made available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8200">'''Worachet Pakeerut''' ({{lang-th|วรเจตน์ ภาคีรัตน์}}, {{RTGS|''Worachet Phakhirat''}}, {{IPA-th|wɔː.rá.t͡ɕèːt pʰaː.kʰiː.rát|IPA}}; born 8 August 1969) is a [[Thailand|Thai]] [[legal scholar]] specialising in [[constitutional law|constitutional]] and [[administrative law]] and a [[professor]] at the [[Faculty of Law, Thammasat University]].

==Education==
Worachet was born in [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province]], where his father was a railway station master. He completed high school at the prestigious [[Triam Udom Suksa School]] in Bangkok before studying law at Thammasat University from which he graduated with an [[honours degree]]. In 1988, he served as deputy president of his university's [[student council]]. The Thai Bar Association [[Bar examination#Thailand|admitted him to the bar]] in 1992. He continued his studies at the [[University of Göttingen]] in [[Germany]], completing the [[Magister Juris]] programme in 1994 with a thesis about the ''[[clausula rebus sic stantibus]]'' in administrative contract law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper |author=Worachet Pakeerut |title=Die clausula rebus sic stantibus im verwaltungsrechtlichen Vertragsrecht |type=M.Jur. thesis |place=Göttingen |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started teaching as a lecturer at the Faculty of Law, Thammasat University, but returned to Göttingen to complete his doctoral studies. Worachet was conferred a [[Doctor of law#Germany|Doctor of Laws]] title in 1999. His thesis about the development of legal doctrine of the "administrative law contract" ''(verwaltungsrechtlicher Vertrag)''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Worachet Pakeerut |title=Die Entwicklung der Dogmatik des verwaltungsrechtlichen Vertrages |publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot |place=Berlin |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; was graded ''[[Latin honors#types|summa cum laude]]''. Once again, he returned to Bangkok to be appointed associate professor at the Thammasat University.&lt;ref name="KhaoSod"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.khaosod.co.th/view_newsonline.php?newsid=TVRRd09EUXpPVE0yTkE9PQ== |title=เส้นทาง "วรเจตน์" ลูกชายนายสถานีรถไฟ สู่ "ศาสตราจารย์ด้านกฎหมาย" รั้วแม่โดม |trans-title=Worachet's path from son of a railway station master to Professor of Law at "Rua Mae Dome" (i.e., Thammasat University's nickname) |newspaper=Khao Sod |date=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Worachet has published a number of textbooks about administrative and constitutional law.&lt;ref name="KhaoSod"/&gt; Since September 2010, he has made public appearances as the most prominent spokesman of the ''Nitirat'' ({{lang|th|นิติราษฏร์}}; literally "Law for the People") group—also known as "Enlightened Jurists"—an association of law lecturers who campaign for constitutional reform and a change of Thailand's [[Lèse majesté in Thailand|lèse majesté law]] (article 112 of the Thai criminal code), proposing to reduce the maximum penalty of currently 15 years, limiting the right to press charges to the office of the king's private secretary (instead of everyone) and excluding constructive criticism from the offence's definition. In late-February 2012, Worachet was assaulted by two men on the parking lot of Thammasat University's downtown campus, who later declared they disagreed with his campaign for a change of article 112.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/Nitirat-academic-Worachet-assualted-30176978.html |title=Nitirat academic Worachet assualted |newspaper=The Nation |date=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Andrew Buncombe |title=Assault on professor underscores battle over Thailand's monarchy law |newspaper=The Independent |date=18 March 2012 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/assault-on-professor-underscores-battle-over-thailands-monarchy-law-7576624.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worachet and his group have repeatedly criticised Thailand's [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]], accusing it of political interventions and exceeding its authority.
