'''90-94 Maiden Lane''' at Gold Street, between William and Pearl Streets in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], was built in 1870-71 in the French [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire style]] and is attributed to Charles Wright.  It has a cast-iron façade from [[Daniel D. Badger]]'s [[Architectural Iron Works]], and is one of the few surviving examples of [[Cast-iron architecture|cast-iron]] architecture between Fulton Street and the Battery, as well as one of the handful of mid-19th century commercial buildings extant in [[Lower Manhattan]].  The building's façade was commissioned by [[Roosevelt &amp; Son]], the leading [[plate glass]] and mirror importer; [[Theodore Roosevelt Sr.]], the father of the [[Theodore Roosevelt|U.S. President of the same name]], was one of the company's principals.  Unlike most other buildings of its sort, it has not been converted into condominium apartments, and is still in use as a commercial building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite aia5}}, p.38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was designated a [[New York City landmark]] on August 1, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Gale; Shockley, Jay (ed.) (August 1, 1989) [http://www.neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/1989MaidenLane.pdf "90-94 Maiden Lane Designation Report] [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albert Dadon''' [[Order of Australia|AM]] (born 1957) is an Australian businessman, philanthropist and musician. He was born in [[Morocco]] and grew up in [[Israel]] and [[France]] before immigrating to [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] in 1983. He is prominent in promoting cultural and business links between Australia and [[Israel]]. He undertakes a range of activities covering international affairs, political activism and cultural activities within Australia and overseas exchange programs. He is executive chairman of [[Ubertas Group]], a diversified funds management and property development company.

From 1991 to 1993 Dadon was chairman of the French [[Chamber of Commerce]] in Australia (Victorian Chapter). He established “Le Concours des Vins du Victoria”, a wine competition in Australia.

From 1994 to 1996, he was director of the Australia French Foundation, an appointment made by Senator [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]], the then Minister of Foreign Affairs of Australia. This foundation was initiated by the then [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]], [[Bob Hawke]], as a gift to France for the bicentennial of the [[French Revolution]].

In 2001 Dadon was chairman of the [[United Israel Appeal]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. He founded in 2002 and then chaired the [[Australian Israel Cultural Exchange]], an organization launched through a Joint Declaration between the Australian and Israeli Governments. A joint declaration announcing and supporting the establishment of AICE by [[Alexander Downer]] MP, Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and [[Binyamin Netanyahu]] MK, Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs, took place simultaneously in [[Parliament House, Canberra]] and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, [[Jerusalem]]. It was the first time that such a joint declaration has been made between the two countries. Dadon also publishes a quarterly magazine for AICE titled ''Rhapsody''. 

From 2003 to 2005 Dadon was chairman of the [[Melbourne Jazz Festival]]. In 2005 he brought to Melbourne the [[Umbria]] [[Jazz]] Festival, which was named “Umbria Jazz Melbourne 05”. The festival in 2005 attracted 135,000 visitors under the artistic direction of [[Carlo Pagnotta]]. The festival is mainly funded by the [[Victorian government]] through Victoria Major Event Company and Arts Victoria. In 2006 the organisation appointed Dadon to become the new director of the festival and take the artistic lead. 

The appointment of Dadon as artistic director resulted in a change of name of the festival to Melbourne Jazz, and the 2007 edition of the festival enjoyed the presence of more than 200 artists from the world around, performing in ten venues in 112 concerts during its ten days. Some of the artists who played at the festival were [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Chick Corea]], [[Gary Burton]] and [[McCoy Tyner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/new-jazz-festival-chief-promises-big-names/2006/09/14/1157827089276.html |title=New jazz festival chief promises big names  |author=Andra Jackson |date= 15 September 2006|publisher=[[The Age]] |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Dadon founded the [[Australian Jazz Bell Awards]] (named after Australian legend and patron of the event [[Graeme Bell]], AO). Dadon chairs the board of The Australian Jazz Awards Limited (a not-for-profit arts organisation) that governs the awards. The Bells are the only  form of formal recognition system entirely devoted to the jazz art form in Australia. They recognise the achievements of young and established Australian jazz performers and composers. 

In 2008 Dadon received an [[Order of Australia]] (AM) for service to the arts, particularly through the Melbourne Jazz Festival, through philanthropic support for cultural and charitable organisations, and to business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.governor.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Infovic/governor/governor.nsf/WVINV/D04EEB9E599DB2FCCA2574BA001ADB52 |title=Investiture |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519092454/http://www.governor.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Infovic/governor/governor.nsf/WVINV/D04EEB9E599DB2FCCA2574BA001ADB52 |archivedate=2009-05-19 |accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Dadon established the Australia Israel Leadership Forum which then became the Australia UK Israel Leadership Dialogue once the UK joined the group in 2011.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://spectator.com.au/2016/12/jerusalem-diary/|title=The Spectator - Jerusalem Diary|author=Tony Abbott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, Albert Dadon realised one of his long-term dreams with the opening of Bird's Basement, a Jazz Club in [[Melbourne]], in association with Birdland New York. {{cite web| url=http://www.3aw.com.au/news/birds-basement-aiming-to-join-the-cultural-calendar-of-melbourne-20160414-go6c4z.html|title=Bird's Basement Website}} {{Quote|text=This is something that is going to be part of the cultural calendar of Melbourne. |author=Albert Dadon}}

Under his stage name "Albare", Dadon is a jazz [[guitarist]] and [[composer]]. He has recorded two albums with [[Festival Records]] in Australia and produced ''A History of Standard Time'', [[Joe Chindamo]]’s first solo recording and featuring [[Ray Brown (musician)|Ray Brown]]. His latest albums are ''Midnight Blues'' (2007), ''After the Rain'' (2009), ''Travel Diary'' (2010), ''Long Way'' (2012), ''The Road Ahead'' (2013), ''2 Decades of Jazz'' (2014), ''Only Human'' (2015) and ''Dream Time'' (2016). Dadon is currently signed to Enja Records.

'''Amélia "Amy" Elizabeth du Pont''' (August 7, 1875 &amp;ndash; February 16, 1962) was a philanthropist and prominent member of the [[Du Pont family]] of [[United States|American]] industrialists.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

==Family==
She was born on August 7, 1880, the fifth of six children born to [[Eugène du Pont]], grandson of [[DuPont]] founder [[Éleuthère Irénée du Pont]] (1771–1834). Eugène was the first head of the modern DuPont corporation, seeing the corporation into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.dupont.com/Phoenix_Heritage/en_US/1889_detail.html |title=Heritage: Eugene du Pont|publisher=[[DuPont]]  |accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amy's mother and namesake, Amélia Elizabeth du Pont, was also born a du Pont, granddaughter of [[Charles I. du Pont]] (1797&amp;ndash;1869), nephew of Éleuthère Irénée.

In his will, Eugène provided equally for his children, but the portions for Amy and her sisters were held in trust for them, while their brothers received their inheritance outright.&lt;ref name="udel"/&gt;

Known as "Miss Amy", she never married.

An ardent horsewoman, she was injured in a fall from a horse in 1954 that restricted her activities. She died on February 16, 1962 at age 86, following a stroke at her home in [[Montecito, California|Montecito]], near Santa Barbara.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Associated Press]] |coauthors= |title=Miss Amy Du Pont Dies |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0816F93E5D117B93C5A81789D85F468685F9 |quote=Miss E. du Pont, great-granddaughter of the founder of the E.I. du Pont de Nemours business enterprises, centered in Wilmington, Del., died today in ... |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 17, 1962 |accessdate=2012-11-27 |subscription=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=clspAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-ugDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5079,393182&amp;dq=amy+du+pont&amp;hl=en ''Spokesman-Review'' (Spokane, Washington) - February 17, 1962]&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried at Santa Barbara Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://santabarbaragenealogy.org/Santa_Barbara_Cemetery/santa_barbara_d.php |publisher=Santa Barbara County Genealogical Society |title=- Santa Barbara Cemetery D |accessdate=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==

Du Pont was a major benefactor of the [[University of Delaware]].&lt;ref name="udel"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.udel.edu/PR/duPontFamily/internal_pages/program_index.html  |title=Familiar Relations: The du Ponts and the University of Delaware |publisher=[[University of Delaware]]|author=Carol E.

In 1939, she and her attorney, Judge [[Hugh M. Morris]], founded the Unidel Foundation, a private charitable organization whose mission is "to aid and promote higher education in the State of Delaware, and to increase, enlarge and improve the scientific and educational advantages and opportunities of its people by gifts and contributions [to the university]."&lt;ref name="udel" /&gt; Without any children, Amy willed much of her inheritance to the Unidel Foundation, including [[DuPont]] and [[Hercules Inc.]] stock valued at some $25 million at her death in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.udel.edu/PR/hoffecker/dedication.html |title=Beneath Thy Guiding Hand |author=Carol Hoffecker |publisher=[[University of Delaware]] |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.udel.edu/PR/UpDate/96/28/20.html |author=Sue Swyers Moncure |title=Significant support; Historian's book explores Unidel Foundation |journal=UpDate |volume=15 |issue=28 |page=3 |publisher=University of Delaware |date=1996-04-18 |accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first major project was to renovate the Carpenter Sports Building, named in honor of du Pont's cousin [[R. R. M. Carpenter]] (1877&amp;ndash;1949), a DuPont executive, owner of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] and long-time benefactor for the university's athletic department.&lt;ref name="udel" /&gt; By the end of the 20th century, Unidel provided more than $112 million to university programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.udel.edu/PR/Messenger/02/2/familiar.html |title=Familiar Relations: The duPonts &amp; the University of Delaware |publisher=UD Messenger |volume=11|issue=2|accessdate=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the Unidel Foundation helped build the Amy E. du Pont Music Building in her honor. It houses the university's department of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amy E. du Pont Music Building |url=http://www.music.udel.edu/about-us/facilities/Pages/default.aspx3 |accessdate=January 20, 2015 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="udel" /&gt;

Archibald was born in Glenfield House in Abbey, near [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], the third son of Archibald Barr, a [[yarn]] merchant, and Jeanie Stirrat,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Barr was educated at [[Paisley Grammar School]] and apprenticed as an engineer to A F Craig &amp; Co in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] before attending [[University of Glasgow]] to study engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.paisleydailyexpress.co.uk/renfrewshire-news/local-news-in-renfrewshire/paisley-news/2010/04/19/scientist-archibald-barr-is-celebrated-in-exhibition-at-paisley-museum-87085-26256610/|title=Scientist Archibald Barr is celebrated in exhibition at Paisley Museum|last=Speirs|work=Paisley Daily Express|accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885 he married Isabella Young.

Barr first worked as assistant to [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]], the [[Regius Professor of Civil Engineering and Mechanics]] at Glasgow, a post Barr was to attain himself later in his career. He was subsequently appointed to the chair of Civil and Mechanical Engineering at the Yorkshire College (since 1904 the [[University of Leeds]]).

Barr was a motoring enthusiast and as a member of the  Scottish Automobile Club, he participated as an organiser of Scotland’s first motor car reliability trials in 1901.
He also helped to form the Scottish Aeronautical Club in 1909, becoming its president, and was a promoter of Scotland’s first aviation meeting, held at [[Lanark]] in 1910.
He served as President of the [[Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland]] in 1910-11. Barr was also a governor of the Royal Scottish National Institution for the care of those with learning difficulties.

He also gifted £8,000 towards the cost of a new organ for [[Paisley Abbey]].

In 1898 he successfully campaigned for a new Chair in Electrical Engineering at [[Glasgow University]]. In 1901 he raised £54,000 to build and equip the James Watt Engineering Building at [[Glasgow University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH2060&amp;type=P&lt;/ref&gt;

Barr died at his home, Westerton of [[Mugdock]], near [[Milngavie]], near Glasgow, on 5 August 1931.

[[File:Connaissement conteneur.JPG|thumbnail|Bill of lading]]

A '''bill of lading''' (sometimes abbreviated as '''B/L''' or '''BoL''') is a document issued by a [[common carrier|carrier]] (or their [[Law of agency|agent]]) to acknowledge receipt of [[good (economics)|cargo]] for [[shipment]]. Although in England, the term once related only to carriage by sea, a bill of lading may be used for any type of carriage of goods.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] s.1(2)b&lt;/ref&gt;

Bills of lading are one of three crucial documents used in [[international trade]] to ensure that [[export]]ers receive payment and [[import]]ers receive the merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/c4isl6rev1_en.pdf|title=UNCTAD|last=|first=|date=|website=unctad|publisher=unctad|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other two documents are a [[insurance policy|policy of insurance]] and an [[invoice]].&lt;ref&gt;In a [[Cost, Insurance and Freight|CIF]] contract, the buyer is essentially buying three documents, all of which grant rights over the cargo&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas a bill of lading is negotiable, both a policy and an invoice are [[assignment (law)|assignable]]. In international trade outside the United States, bills of lading are distinct from [[waybill]]s in that the latter are not transferable and do not confer title. Nevertheless, the UK [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] grants "all rights of suit under the contract of carriage" to the lawful holder of a bill of lading, or to the consignee under a sea waybill or a ship's delivery order.

A bill of lading must be transferable,&lt;ref&gt;[[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] s.1(2)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;If a so-called "bill of lading" is NOT transferable, it will be merely a sea-waybill or a ship's delivery order&lt;/ref&gt; and serves three main functions:
*  it is a conclusive receipt,&lt;ref&gt;[[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] s.4&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. an acknowledgement that the goods have been loaded;&lt;ref&gt;... or received for shipment&lt;/ref&gt; and
* it contains or evidences&lt;ref&gt;"Evidences": the contract may already have been made informally by say, booking cargo space on board.&lt;/ref&gt; the terms of the contract of carriage; and
* it serves as a document of title to the goods,&lt;ref name="Levi 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Finance, 4th Edition | author = Levi, Maurice D. | year = 2005 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-41-530900-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; subject to the ''[[nemo dat quod non habet|nemo dat]]'' rule.

Typical export transaction use [[INCOTERMS]] terms such as [[Cost, Insurance and Freight|CIF]], [[FOB (shipping)|FOB]] or [[Free Alongside Ship|FAS]], requiring the exporter/shipper to deliver the goods to the ship, whether onboard or alongside. Nevertheless, the loading itself will usually be done by the carrier himself or by a third party [[stevedore]]; (see [[Scruttons Ltd v Midland Silicones Ltd]] and [[NZ Shipping Co Ltd v A M Satterthwaite &amp; Co Ltd|NZ Shipping Co Ltd v A M Satterthwaite &amp; Co Ltd - The ''Eurymedon'']]).

==Description==
A bill of lading is a standard-form document that is transferable by endorsement (or by lawful transfer of possession).&lt;ref name="B.L. Mathur and Raman K. Dave"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bohra|first=Harsh|title=International Trade and Finance|publisher=Wide Vision}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most shipments by sea are covered by the [[Hague Rules]], the [[Hague-Visby Rules]] or the [[Hamburg Rules]], which require the carrier to issue the shipper a bill of lading identifying the nature, quantity, quality and leading marks&lt;ref&gt;that is, the identification marks and numbers.&lt;/ref&gt; of the goods.

In the case of ''Coventry v Gladstone'', Lord Justice Blackburn defined a bill of lading as "A writing signed on behalf of the owner of ship in which goods are embarked, acknowledging the receipt of the Goods, and undertaking to deliver them at the end of the voyage, subject to such conditions as may be mentioned in the bill of lading." Therefore, it can be stated that the bill of lading was introduced to provide a receipt to the shipper in the absence of the owners.

Although the term "bill of lading" is well known and well understood, it may become obsolete.  Articles 1:15 &amp; 1:16 of the [[Rotterdam Rules]] create the new term "transport document"; but (assuming the Rules come into force) it remains to be seen whether shippers, carriers and "maritime performing parties" (another new Rotterdam Rules coinage) will abandon the long-established and familiar term, "bill of lading".

==History==
While there is evidence of the existence of receipts for goods loaded aboard merchant vessels stretching back as far as Roman times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/3629/Du%20Toit%208%20December%202005.pdf?sequence=1|pages=2–3|title=THE EVOLUTION OF THE BILL OF LADING SF du Toit (University of Johannesburg)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the practice of recording cargo aboard ship in the ship's log is almost as long-lived as shipping itself, the modern bill of lading only came into use with the growth of international trade in the medieval world.

The growth of mercantilism (which produced other financial innovations such as the [[charterparty]] (once ''carta partita''), the [[bill of exchange]] and the [[insurance policy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://maritimeknowhow.com/wp-content/uploads/image/Bills%20of%20lading/B-L%20split/B-L%208-10%20Hist%20Intro.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) produced a requirement for a title document that could be traded in much the same way as the goods themselves. It was this new avenue of trade that produced the bill of lading in much the same form as we know today.

Although the term "bill of lading" is well known and well understood, it may become obsolete. Articles 1:15 &amp; 1:16 of the [[Rotterdam Rules]] create the new term "transport document"; but (assuming the Rotterdam Rules come into force) it remains to be seen whether shippers, carriers and "maritime performing parties" (another new Rotterdam Rules coinage) will abandon the familiar term "bill of lading".

==Roles and purposes of bill of lading==

===As cargo receipt===
The principal use of the bill of lading is as a receipt issued by the carrier once the goods have been loaded onto the vessel. This receipt can be used as proof of shipment for customs and insurance purposes, and also as commercial proof of completing a contractual obligation,&lt;ref&gt;Qais Ali Mahafzah, ''The Legal Effectiveness of the Both-to-Blame Collision Clause under Bills of Lading and Charterparties'', 41 Journal of Maritime Law &amp; Commerce 263 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;especially under [[Incoterms|INCOTERMS]] such as CFR&lt;ref&gt;CFR - formerly known as C&amp;F&lt;/ref&gt; (cost and freight) and [[FOB (shipping)|FOB (free on board)]].

Although the [[Hague-Visby Rules]] provide that a bill of lading is only ''prima facie'' evidence of receipt, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 s.4 declares a BoL "conclusive evidence of receipt".&lt;ref&gt;s.4 thereby overrules the decision in ''Grant v Norway'' 1851 10 CB 665&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Law Commission report into "Rights of Suit in respect of Carriage of Goods by Sea", LAW COM No 196 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayer|first1=Ray August ; with revisions by Don|last2=Bixby|first2=Michael|title=International business law : text, cases, and readings|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=Harlow [etc.]|isbn=0273768611|edition=6th ed., international}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A "clean bill of lading" (aka "on-board bill of lading") is used when there is full compliance with no discrepancies between the description filed by shipper and the actual goods shipped. A clean bill of lading indicates that the goods have been properly loaded on board the carrier's ship in accordance with the contract. 

* A "dirty bill of lading" (aka "claused bill of lading") will be issued if the goods to be shipped differ in quality or quantity from the contract description, or if freight has yet to be paid. The buyer's bank is entitled to reject a dirty bill of lading, but will often accept it after an agreed reduction in price.&lt;ref name="Buckley 2004" /&gt;

* "STC": if the cargo cannot be effectively examined, such as goods in a sealed [[Intermodal container|container]]), the carrier will issue a bill of lading describing the goods as "container (identified by number) '''said to contain'''"  the contracted cargo. If the cargo within the contain do not ply with description, the consignee will take action against the seller, and the carrier will not be involved.

===As evidence of the contract of carriage===
The bill of lading from carrier to shipper can be used as an evidence of the contract of carriage by the fact that carrier has received the goods and upon the receipt the carrier would deliver the goods. In this case, the bill of lading would be used as a contract of carriage. In this case, the bill of lading can be used if shipper does not properly ship the goods then the shipper cannot receive the bill of lading from the carrier. Eventually, the shipper would have to deliver the bill of lading to the seller. In this case, the bill of lading is used as a contract of carriage between seller and carrier. However, when the bill of lading is negotiated to a [[bona fide]] third party then the bill of lading becomes a conclusive evidence where no contradictory evidence can be introduced. It is because the third party cannot examine the actual shipment and can only pay attention to the document itself, not survey or examination of the shipment itself.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt; However, the bill of lading will rarely be the contract itself, since the cargo space will have been booked previously, perhaps by telephone, email or letter. The preliminary contract will be acknowledged by both the shipper and carrier to incorporate the carrier's standard terms of business. If the [[Hague-Visby Rules]] apply, then all of the Rules will be automatically annexed to the bill of lading, thus forming a statutory contract.

===As title===
When the bill of lading is used as a document of title, it is particularly related to the case of buyer. When the buyer is entitled to received goods from the carrier, bill of lading in this case performs as document of title for the goods. There are two types of bill of lading that can perform as document of title. They are straight bill of lading and order bill of lading. Straight bill of lading is a bill of lading issued to a named consignee that is not negotiable. In this case, the bill of lading should be directed only to one specific consignee indicated on the bill of lading. Order bill of lading is the opposite from a straight bill of lading and there is no specific or named consignee. Therefore, an order bill of lading can be negotiated to a third party.

Simply, the bill of lading confers ''prima facie'' title over the goods to the named consignee or lawful holder. Under the "''nemo dat quod non habet"'' rule ("no one gives what he doesn't have"), a seller cannot pass better title than he himself has; so if the goods are subject to an encumbrance (such as a mortgage, charge or hypothec), or even stolen, the bill of lading will not grant full title to the holder.

==Types of bills of lading==
Bills of lading may take various forms, such as on-board and received-for-shipment.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] s.1(2) provides that a bill of lading may be a "received for shipment bill of lading"&lt;/ref&gt;
* An on-board bill of lading denotes that merchandise has been physically loaded onto a shipping vessel, such as a freighter or cargo plane.
* A received-for-shipment bill of lading denotes that merchandise has been received, but is not guaranteed to have already been loaded onto a shipping vessel.(Typically, it will be issued by a freight-forwarder at a port or depot). Such bills can be converted upon being loaded.&lt;ref&gt;... but there is no legal advantage to this exercise.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Charter-party Bill of lading.png|alt= Charter-party bill of lading|thumb|Charter-party bill of lading, for a sulfuric acid bulk cargo]]
* A straight bill of lading is used when payment has been made in advance of shipment and requires a carrier to deliver the merchandise to the appropriate party.
* An order bill of lading is used when shipping merchandise prior to payment, requiring a carrier to deliver the merchandise to the importer, and at the endorsement of the exporter the carrier may transfer title to the importer. Endorsed order bills of lading can be traded as a [[security (finance)|security]] or serve as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] against [[debt]] obligations.&lt;ref name="Buckley 2004"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Multinational Finance | author = Buckley, Adrian | year = 2004 | publisher = Pearson Education Limited | location = Harlow, UK | isbn = 978-0-27-368209-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bills of lading and charterparties compared==
A charterparty is the contract governing the relationship between the shipowner and the charterer. The bill of lading governs the relationship between the shipper and the carrier (who will be either a shipowner or a demise charterer). If the exporter (the shipper) is shipping a small amount of cargo, he will arrange for a carrier to carry the goods for him, using a bill of lading. If the exporter needs the whole (or a very substantial part) of the ship's cargo capacity, the exporter may need to charter the vessel, and he will enter into a charterparty agreement with the shipowner.

If the charter party is a time or voyage charterparty, the shipowner will still have control of the ship and its crew. If there is a demise (or "bareboat") charterparty, the charterer will effectively have a long lease and will have full control of the vessel. When the master (captain) issues a B/L to a shipper, he will be acting as an agent for the carrier, who will be either the shipowner (time or voyage) or the charterer (demise).

In a time-charterparty or voyage-charterparty, if the charterer is shipping his own cargo (rather than the cargo of a third party) he will receive a bill of lading from the master, acting as agent of the shipowner; but that B/L will serve solely as a receipt and document of title, and its terms will (subject to contrary intent) be secondary to the terms of the charterparty, which remains the dominant contract.&lt;ref&gt;see: ''Sandeman v Scurr'' (1866) L.R. 2 Q.B. 86,  ''Manchester Trust v Furness'' [1895] 2 QB 282 &amp; [1895] 2 QB 539, &amp; ''The Draupner'' [1910] AC 450&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sea waybills and electronic data interchange (EDI)==
Under Art. III of the Hague-Visby Rules, a carrier must, on demand, provide the shipper with a bill of lading; but if the shipper agrees, a lesser document such as a  "[[waybill|sea waybill]]" may be issued instead. In recent years, the use of bills of lading has declined, and they have tended to be replaced with the sea waybill. (If a so-called bill of lading is declared to be "non-negotiable", then it is not a true B/L,&lt;ref&gt;s.1 Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and instead will be treated as a sea waybill.)

The main difference between these two documents is that the waybill gives the bearer the right to '''possession''' of the cargo, but does not confer '''title in the goods'''. As a result, there is no need for the physical document to be presented for the goods to be released. The carrier will automatically release the goods to the consignee once the import formalities have been completed. This results in a much smoother flow of trade, and has allowed shipping lines to move towards [[electronic data interchange]] which may greatly ease the flow of global trade.

For some time, it has been the case that the cargo may arrive at the destination before the bill of lading; and a practice has arisen for the shipper (having sent the bill of lading to the banks for checking) to send to the consignee a '''letter of indemnity''' (LOI) which can be presented to the carrier in exchange for the cargo. The LOI indemnifies the carrier against any cargo claim, but the document is not transferable and has no established legal status. For [[letter of credit]] and [[documentary collection]] transactions, it is important to retain title to the goods until the transaction is complete. This means that the bill of lading still remains a vital document within international trade.

===Electronic bills of lading===
For many years, the industry has sought a solution to the difficulties, costs and inefficiencies associated with paper bills of lading. One answer is to make the bill an electronic document.&lt;ref&gt;Section 1(5) of the UK's [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] empowers the minister to make such provisions.&lt;/ref&gt;  An electronic bill of lading (or '''eB/L''') is the legal and functional equivalent of a paper bill of lading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukpandi.com/knowledge/article/paperless-trading-electronic-bills-of-lading-frequently-asked-questions-faqs-6167/ |title=PAPERLESS TRADING (ELECTRONIC BILLS OF LADING) ‐Frequently asked questions ("FAQs") - UK P&amp;I |publisher=Ukpandi.com |date=2013-07-30 |accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; An electronic bill of lading must replicate the core functions of a paper bill of lading, namely its functions as a receipt, as evidence of or containing the contract of carriage and as a document of title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essdocs.com/resources/electronic-bill-of-lading |title=Electronic Bills of Lading (eB/Ls) |publisher=Essdocs.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK [[Carriage of Goods Act 1992]] s.1(5) enables the trade minister to make [[statutory instrument|regulations]] for electronic transactions. As yet, no such regulations have been made, as electronic interchange is already lawful. Electronic "clubs" such as BOLERO&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bolero.net/home/electronic-bills-lading/ BOLERO]&lt;/ref&gt; have been quite successful, but the maritime trade community is traditional and loath to move away from paper transactions, so progress has been very slow. However, in recent times, it has been proposed that '''[[Blockchain]]''' technology may be the answer to cover the myriad steps in an export trade transaction, thereby enabling electronic transactions and information transfer that is both speedy and reliable.

==Name==
The word "lading" means "loading", both words being derived from the Old English word ''hladan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lade&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Lading" specifically refers to the loading of cargo aboard a ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/lading |title=Definition of lading in English |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=2015-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch word "lading" has exactly the same meaning (freight, cargo, an amount of transportable goods) as it has in the English "bill of lading", but is not restricted to shipping.

Under English law, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 provides that the term "bill of lading" includes a "received-for-shipment" bill of lading issued by, say, a [[freight forwarder]] or a storage depot/warehouse. A "combined bill of lading" may be issued by a carrier who, say, collects goods from a factory for subsequent delivery to a ship via [[multi-modal transport]].

The '''Chanin Building''' is a brick and [[terra-cotta]] [[skyscraper]] located at 122 East [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]], at the corner of [[Lexington Avenue]], in [[Midtown Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Built by [[Irwin S. Chanin]] in 1927–1929, it is 56 stories high, reaching {{convert|197.8|m|ft}} excluding the spire and {{convert|207.3|m|ft}} including it. It was designed by [[Sloan &amp; Robertson]] in the [[Art Deco]] style,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc-architecture.com/MID/MID019.htm NYC-Architecture: Chanin Building]&lt;/ref&gt; with the assistance of Chanin's own architect [[Jacques Delamarre]], and it incorporates architectural sculpture by [[Rene Paul Chambellan]].

The building was designated a [[New York City landmark]] in 1978, and was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.

==Description==
The base of the building boasts black [[Belgian marble]] around the store fronts with a bronze frieze directly above depicting scenes of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviewoncities.com/nyc/chaninbuilding.htm A View on Cities: Chanin Building]&lt;/ref&gt; A second terra-cotta frieze runs the whole length of the lower facade, presenting a dramatic collection of angular [[zigzags]] and curvy leaves. The tower rises 22 stories and then thins into a series of [[Setback (architecture)|setback]]s, reaching a total of 56 floors. The top of the building is a series of buttresses that are illuminated from the inside at night, lighting up the recesses in the crown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officesublets.com/blog/2012/04/chanins-eponymous-midtown-art-deco-office-building/ Chanin's Eponymous Midtown Art Deco Office Tower], OfficeSublets.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lobbies, which originally served as a "palatial" bus terminal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gray |first=Christopher |title=A Bus Terminal, Overshadowed and Unmourned |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 6, 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/realestate/the-west-30s-streetscapes-a-bus-terminal-overshadowed-and-unmourned.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which still connect to the [[Grand Central–42nd Street (New York City Subway)|Grand Central subway station]], eight bronze reliefs designed by [[Rene Paul Chambellan]] perch above ornate bronze radiator grilles. The bronze ornamentation continues in the waves on the floor, mailboxes, and elevator doors extending the general Art Deco style from the outside in. When originally completed, the 50th floor had a silver-and-black high-brow movie theater. This floor and the 51st are now offices joined by a stairwell instead. Initially a dominant landmark in the midtown skyline, the building had an open-air observatory on the 54th floor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecityreview.com/chanin.html The City Review: Chanin Building]&lt;/ref&gt; Having been surpassed in height by a number of buildings, most notably the [[Chrysler Building]] located across the street, the observatory has been long closed. The self-supporting tower atop the building was the original transmission site for [[WQXR-FM]] from 1936 to 1965, when it moved to the [[Empire State Building]].

'''Credit agreements in South Africa''' are agreements or contracts in South Africa in terms of which payment or repayment by one party (the debtor) to another (the creditor) is deferred. This entry discusses the core elements of credit agreements as defined in the National Credit Act, and the consequences of concluding a credit agreement in South Africa.

== Definitions of types of credit transactions ==
It is essential that the meanings of important terms used in the practice of consumer law are clearly understood. Most of the definitions below are obtained from the National Credit Act 34 of 2005 (“the Act”).

=== Agreement ===
An “agreement” simply means a contract.

=== Credit ===
“Credit” means a deferral or delay of payment of a sum of money to another person, or a promise to pay money.

The critical role of credit in the economy is explained in the August 2004 policy framework of the Department of Trade and Industry:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Credit enables people to have use of a product or service, at a cost represented by an interest rate, prior to their having paid for that product or service or, where an item cannot be afforded from a single month’s salary, to spread payments over a number of months.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This document goes on to describe credit as a “double-edged sword,” because of the “considerable imbalance of power between consumers and credit providers,” due to poor consumer education levels and knowledge of consumer rights, and inability to enforce such rights through negotiation or legal action:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Credit cannot therefore be seen as a universal basic service to which access should be extended in the same way as access to water, health care and electricity. There is a greater need to balance access to credit with protection for consumers, especially the vulnerable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Credit provider ===
A credit provider is the party who supplies goods or services (in terms of an instalment sale agreement, for example), or who pays money (in terms, for example, of a secured or unsecured money loan, overdraft facility, pawn transaction or mortgage loan). The credit provider is often also referred to as “the creditor,” in particular when steps are taken to recover amounts due from the consumer.

=== Consumer ===
A consumer is the party to whom goods or services are sold, or to whom money is loaned in any of the examples referred to above. When steps are taken to recover amounts due, the consumer is often referred to as “the debtor.”

=== Credit agreement ===
An agreement is a credit agreement if it provides for a deferral or delay of payment, and if there is a fee or interest charged for the deferred payment. The Act does not require that a credit agreement be in writing and signed by both parties, although this is implied throughout the Act. A credit agreement may be a credit facility, a credit transaction or a credit guarantee (or a combination of these). These three terms are defined in section 8 of the Act.

==== Credit facility ====
A credit facility is an agreement in terms of which a credit provider supplies goods or services, or pays an amount to the consumer. The consumer's obligation to pay the price or repay the money is deferred, in exchange for which the consumer pays interest and fees. Examples of a credit facility are credit advanced

* on an overdrawn cheque account in terms of an overdraft facility; or
* on a credit card account.

==== Credit transaction ====
A “credit transaction” may refer any one of a number of different types of transactions. Most important for present purposes are the follow

===== Instalment agreements =====
In terms of instalment agreements, movable goods (like furniture, clothing or a car) are sold, the price is paid in instalments, and the item is delivered to the consumer. The consumer becomes owner only once all instalments have been paid.

===== Unsecured money loans =====
Unsecured money loans are usually smaller money loans (micro-loans) re-payable in instalments, where the lender is given no security for re-payment of the debt.

===== Pawn transactions =====
In terms of pawn transactions, money is lent and the borrower provides an item of property as security, the resale value of which is greater than the loan. The creditor is entitled to sell the property if the money is not repaid by an agreed date, and to keep the proceeds of the sale.

===== Mortgage agreements =====
Mortgage agreements are money loans secured by the registration of a mortgage bond over land, the proceeds of which are usually used to buy land or housing.

===== Secured loans =====
In terms of secured loans, money is paid, and the credit provider receives a pledge of any movable property or something else of value as security for repayment of the loan.

===== Leases of movable goods =====
Leases of movable goods—that is, not land or housing—would include, for example, a telefax machine or a motor car, with rent being paid in instalments, together with fees and interest. (If interest and fees are not charged, it will not be a credit transaction in terms of the Act). The total instalments will usually amount to the value of the item let. Once all instalments are paid, ownership passes to the consumer. This is contrary to the common law of lease. If, however, the agreement provides that ownership will always remain with the lessor, it will still be a credit transaction in terms of the Act.

==== Credit guarantees ====
In terms of a credit guarantee, a third party agrees to pay to a creditor the amount due by a consumer, on demand (as, for example, in the case of suretyship, in terms of which personal security is provided for the debt of another person resulting from an overdrawn cheque account).

==== Incidental credit agreements ====
Incidental credit agreements occur when goods or services are provided to a consumer over a period of time and a fee or interest is charged only if payment is not made by an agreed date. Examples include

* accounts for municipal services, such as water or electricity; and
* sales of clothing where no interest is charged provided that the account is paid by a certain date.

Incidental credit agreements do not fall under the definition of credit agreements in the Act. Section 5 sets out the limited provisions of the Act applicable to them.

A number of other agreements are not regarded as credit agreements by the Act, including

* transactions between a [[stokvel]] (a voluntary association involving a rotating financial scheme with entertainment, social or economic functions) and its members;
* an insurance policy; and
* a lease of immovable property.

== National Credit Act ==
The National Credit Act is a complicated and lengthy piece of legislation that tries to regulate closely every sector of the consumer credit market. The last provisions of the Act became effective on June 1, 2007. The Act repealed the Usury Act&lt;ref&gt;Act 73 of 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Credit Agreements Act,&lt;ref&gt;Act 75 of 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and bears very little resemblance to these Acts. It represents a clean break from the past. All consumer credit law is contained within the Act, which applies to all credit agreements and all credit providers.

The Act has the ambitious and extremely difficult objective of promoting a competitive, efficient and effective credit industry and market which is at the same time fair, transparent, responsible and accessible. The overriding theme of the Act is consumer protection. Section 3 of the Act sets out a number of methods that the Act adopts to achieve this.

=== Important consumer credit institutions ===

==== National Credit Regulator ====
Much of the responsibility for implementing the purposes of the Act lies with the National Credit Regulator (NCR), which oversees the entire consumer credit industry, including all the functions and responsibilities of the former Micro-finance Regulatory Council (in the micro-lending context). The NCR is an independent organisation governed by a Board, with a Chief Executive Officer who may appoint inspectors and investigators.

The NCR has an enormous number of responsibilities. These are set out in great detail in sections 13 to 18 of the Act. It remains to be seen whether or not it will have the necessary capacity to perform all these functions. Its responsibilities include

* the promotion and development of a credit market accessible to all;
* monitoring and reporting annually certain market trends to the Minister;
* conducting research and proposing policies to the Minister regarding the consumer credit industry;
* regulating the industry by registering credit providers, credit bureaux and debt counsellors, and suspending or cancelling registration;
* enforcing the Act in numerous ways listed in section 15;
* promoting public awareness of consumer credit matters in various ways listed in section 16 (consumer education);
* engaging with provincial regulatory authorities;
* advising the Minister; and
* recommending and reporting to the Minister on various aspects of consumer credit practice, policy and legislation.

==== National Consumer Tribunal ====
The National Consumer Tribunal is an independent body, separate from the NCR. It has jurisdiction throughout South Africa, and comprises a chairperson and at least ten other members appointed by the President. A tribunal of record, it conducts its proceedings in public in an informal, inquisitorial manner. It applies principles of natural justice, and has the function of ruling on any matter brought before it in terms of the Act. The Act provides rules of practice, procedure, evidence and a list of possible orders in relation to the Tribunal.

The powers of the Tribunal are mentioned throughout the Act, the most important of which are

* to hear cases of alleged contraventions of the Act, mostly by credit providers;
* to impose fines;
* to make orders reflecting resolutions agreed in other fora; and
* to function as an appeal body. (Decisions of the NCR, for example, may be taken on appeal to the Tribunal.)

==== Registers ====
The NCR is required to establish and maintain two important registers:

# a register of certain persons; and
# a national register of credit agreements.

===== Register of certain persons =====
Credit providers, credit bureaux and debt counsellors are required to register with the NCR. Before a credit provider enters into a credit agreement (threshold is R zero) it has to register with the NCR.

The NCR has the power to suspend or cancel registration in certain circumstances.

Any person may access this register on the NCR website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncr.org.za.|title=Home|website=www.ncr.org.za.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or may obtain a copy of an extract from the register on payment of a fee. Any person may also obtain a copy of a registration certificate on payment of a fee.

Credit providers and credit bureaux were required to register with the NCR by July 28, 2006. Debt counsellors may register at any time.

===== National register of credit agreements =====
The NCR may be required by the Minister to establish a single national register of outstanding credit agreements, but it has not done so yet. Once established, credit providers will have to submit the following information in relation to every credit agreement:

* names and addresses of the credit provider and the consumer;
* the registration number of the credit provider;
* the identity number of the consumer;
* the principal debt under a credit agreement;
* the credit limit under a credit facility; and
* the amount and schedule of the monthly instalments payable.

Certain information regarding credit agreements entered into prior to the coming into effect of the Act must also be provided. This register will be accessible to any person on application in the prescribed form. It will also provide a way of monitoring South Africa's consumer debt levels, which the NCR is required to do.

==== Credit bureaux ====
A credit bureau is an entity that is engaged for payment in the business of receiving reports or investigating credit applications and agreements, payment history or patterns, and other consumer credit information. Credit bureaux are also in the business of compiling and maintaining data and issuing reports concerning consumers based on this data. As indicated above, credit bureaux were required to register with the NCR by July 28, 2006. Credit bureaux assist credit providers with information that could prevent over-indebtedness of consumers and the granting of reckless credit.

==== Debt counsellors ====
Debt counsellors are not defined in the Act. The NCR's “Debt Counsellor Training Program Learners’ Guide” describes the debt counsellor as “a registrant who is required to do certain tasks stipulated in the Act—including facilitating, investigating, and recommending solutions for over-indebtedness.”

Debt counsellors have a number of functions which appear throughout the Act. The main role of debt counsellors is to evaluate consumers’ indebtedness (upon referral of the consumer by a court, or upon application by the consumer directly to the debt counsellor). The debt counsellor may then recommend to the court

* that the consumer is over-indebted;
* that one or more credit agreements are reckless (and should be set aside or suspended); and
* that the consumer's debts be re-structured.

This procedure is explained in more detail below.

Debt counsellors must apply to the NCR to be registered as such. The Act contains a lengthy list of reasons for disqualification as a debt counsellor. In addition, the Regulations provide that debt counsellors must

* have a Grade-12 or equivalent qualification;
* complete an NCR-approved debt counselling course;
* have a minimum of 2 years’ working experience in certain fields; and
* show an ability to manage their own finances, and to provide counselling or transfer skills.

==== Consumer courts ====
Consumer courts are tribunals established by provincial legislation. The Act allows these courts to be used in various circumstances. There is only one instance where these courts operate at the same level as the National Consumer Tribunal, which is when the NCR refers a complaint to it. Most provinces have introduced their own legislation, but only Gauteng presently has a properly-functioning consumer court.

==== Ombuds ====
The Act uses the gender-neutral term “ombud” (often known as ombudsman). The Act provides that certain disputes between a financial institution (like a bank) and a consumer, arising from a credit agreement, may be referred to the relevant ombud. The ombud will then act as mediator between the institution and the consumer with a complaint.

== Conclusion of credit agreements ==

=== Pre-agreement disclosure ===
Before concluding a credit agreement, the credit provider must give to the consumer, free of charge, a statement and quotation in the form prescribed by the Regulations (Form 20 to the Regulations, in the case of small credit agreements). No agreement is entered into at this stage; the consumer does not have to sign anything or pay any fee. This is a new development in the law, designed to protect consumers. This document must contain the financial details of the proposed agreement (like the amount of credit provided, the number and amount of instalments payable, interest and other fees, deposit required and credit insurance). Consumers must accept or reject the quotation within five days, giving them a chance to shop around for better or cheaper credit. Once the consumer has accepted the quotation, the credit agreement itself can then be concluded.

=== Form and contents of credit agreements ===
The form of the document that records the credit agreement is prescribed by regulation, and varies for different-size credit agreements. The details required for a small credit agreement (a principal debt of less than R15 000) are set out in Form 20.2 to the Regulations. This is not really a form, but rather a framework for the minimum contents of the agreement. These details include

* the parties’ personal particulars;
* the financial details of the agreement (similar to those required for the pre-agreement disclosure above); and
* certain of the consumer's statutory rights and duties (discussed below).

The credit provider must give to the consumer, free of charge, a copy of the signed credit agreement (in paper form or printable electronic form).

Credit agreements may be altered only in very specific circumstances, most importantly in relation to the reduction or increase in credit limits.

== Rights and duties of consumers and credit providers ==
Many consumer rights are contained in the Act, but very few rights for credit providers. (By contrast, credit providers have many duties.) The Act is biased towards consumers, because it seeks to redress imbalances inherent in our common law. This is not unusual for legislation of this kind.

=== Right to apply for credit and non-discrimination ===
Every adult person has the right to apply for credit, but no-one has the right to be granted credit. A credit grantor may choose to refuse credit for reasonable business reasons, but may not unfairly discriminate against a consumer relative to other consumers on the grounds of race, religion, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, culture, language, etc. A consumer may ask for reasons for the refusal of credit, which must be given by the credit provider in writing.

=== Right to understandable language ===
The consumer has the right to be given a quotation and credit agreement in an official language that he reads or understands, to the extent that this is reasonable. Any documents where no form is prescribed must be in plain language (language which an ordinary consumer with average literacy skills and minimal credit experience will understand).

=== Rights regarding information held by credit bureaux ===
Credit bureaux have an important role. For example, they provide credit providers with information on the creditworthiness of consumers. This information could, of course, be damaging to consumers. Credit bureaux are therefore obliged to check with other sources that the information given to them by credit providers is correct. Consumers have the right to have information relating to rescinded judgments expunged (removed) from the records of credit bureaux. Likewise, a consumer who has satisfied all his obligations in terms of a debt rearrangement has the right to have the fact that a debt rearrangement previously existed removed from these records.

A credit provider must advise a debtor before reporting unfavourable information to a credit bureau. Any person may challenge the accuracy of any information reported to or held by a credit bureau. The credit bureau or NCR is then obliged to investigate at no charge and rectify any incorrect information.

The regulations prescribe maximum periods of time that different categories of consumer credit information may be retained by credit bureaux. For example, civil judgments may be retained for the earliest of

* five years;
* until date of rescission by a court; or
* abandonment by credit provider.

Anyone has the right to a free credit bureau report once per year. After that it will cost R20 per enquiry. Two important credit bureaux, with contact numbers, are:
• ITC — 086 148 2482 (Website: www.mycredit.co.za).
• Experian — 086 110 5665 (Website: www.creditexpert.co.za)

=== Protection against marketing practices ===
The Act contains a number of rules in this regard:

* The advertising and marketing of credit must contain prescribed information on the cost of credit (interest and all other charges).
* Negative-option marketing (in terms of which an agreement will automatically come into existence unless the consumer declines an offer) is not permitted.
* Advertisements must not be misleading, fraudulent or deceptive.
* Credit providers may not harass anyone, or try to coerce or persuade anyone to apply for credit.
* Credit sales at a person's home are strictly prohibited, unless
** the sale of credit occurs during a pre-arranged visit for that purpose by the consumer; or
** the provision of credit is incidental to the sale of goods or services.
* A credit provider may require that a consumer have credit life insurance during the existence of a credit agreement, but has a duty to ensure that suitable options for insurance cover are offered to the consumer.

=== Right to confidentiality and privacy ===
Credit bureaux are required to protect the confidentiality of consumer credit information that they hold or report on. Credit providers must also present to consumers the options of being excluded from telemarketing campaigns, marketing or customer lists sold or distributed and mass distribution of e-mail or SMS messages.

=== Right of cooling-off ===
In certain circumstances, consumers may terminate agreements (in writing and properly delivered) within five business days of signing them. This cooling-off right applies only to leases and instalment agreements that are concluded at a location other than the registered business premises of the credit provider. Typically, this right will apply to credit sales on instalments (as in the cases of cars, books, household appliances) concluded at the consumer's home or place of work. The consumer must return the goods bought, and the credit provider must refund amounts paid by the consumer within seven days of termination, less the following:

* reasonable costs of return and repair of damages after sale;
* rent for use of the goods, unless they are still in their original packaging; and
* compensation for depreciation in value of the goods (by agreement or court order only).

=== Early settlement and repayments ===
Consumers are entitled to settle their debts in advance at any time, with or without advance notice, after requesting a statement from the credit provider of the amount required to settle the account. No settlement charge is payable for small agreements; interest and other fees are payable only until date of settlement. This means that a consumer may request from the credit provider the balance due, pay the entire amount, and not be penalised for doing so.

This, however, does not apply to large agreements such as mortgage bonds. If a consumer wishes to settle a bond he must first give notice of cancellation for a period of three months to the credit provider. When a mortgage bond is cancelled, the consumer will be liable for bond cancellation costs.

Consumers may prepay any amount due under a credit agreement (e.g. instalments due) and credit providers are obliged to accept such amounts, even if they are not due. Such payments are used for unpaid interest and fees first, and then to reduce the principal debt.

=== Surrender of goods ===
A consumer may, at any time, return to a credit provider goods that are subject to a credit agreement, whether or not the consumer is in default. The credit provider must then sell the goods and use the proceeds to settle the account. In terms of the former Credit Agreements Act, this procedure applied only when the consumer was in default. This new provision gives the consumer an extraordinary right, enabling him to rid himself of the agreement when he chooses to.

The following procedure must be followed if the consumer elects to enforce this right:

# The consumer must notify the credit provider in writing of the termination of the agreement, and return the goods to the credit provider.
# If the credit provider is already in possession of the goods, the consumer may require the credit provider to sell the goods.
# The credit provider must notify the consumer within ten days of the estimated value of the goods.
# Once the consumer receives this notice of estimated value, he may withdraw his notice of termination within ten days, and resume possession of the goods, unless he is in default under the agreement.
# If the consumer does not respond to the credit provider's notice of estimated value within ten days, the credit provider must sell the goods as soon as possible for the best price possible.
# After the goods have been sold, the credit provider must credit or debit the consumer's account with the proceeds of the sale, less the reasonable costs of the sale.
# The credit provider must give to the consumer a notice indicating the settlement amount before the sale, the amount realised by the sale, and the net proceeds of the sale (after deduction of default charges and the costs of the sale).
# If the result of the sale is a credit balance on the account, this amount must be repaid to the consumer. If there is a debit balance, the credit provider may demand and, if necessary, sue the consumer for the outstanding balance.
# If the consumer is not satisfied that the goods were sold as soon as possible or for the best price possible, he may attempt to resolve the dispute with the credit provider, or through alternative-dispute methods, or through referral to the National Consumer Tribunal. The Tribunal may award the consumer an additional amount if this is deemed necessary.

=== Statements of account ===
The Act contains detailed provisions regarding statements of account. The Regulations prescribe the form and content of statements in the case of small agreements. Credit providers must deliver to consumers periodic statements of account, usually once a month (but once every two months for instalment sale agreements).

Credit providers are also obliged to provide consumers with statements of account on request, at no charge. The consumer may choose how the statement must be delivered:

* orally (in person, or by telephone); or
* in writing (in person, by SMS, by mail, by fax or by email—provided that the credit provider has these facilities).

Credit providers need not give written statements on demand more than once every three months.

=== Right to apply for debt review and re-structuring of debt ===
These provisions are explained in detail below.

=== Duty to report location of goods ===
In the case of certain credit agreements (typically instalment agreements), the consumer becomes the owner only once the full purchase price has been paid, and the credit provider has a right to repossession on breach of the agreement. Until then, the credit provider has an interest in the whereabouts of the goods.

The consumer has a duty to inform the credit provider of any of the following changes:

* changes of business or residential address;
* changes of the premises where the goods are kept; and
* changes of the name and address of any other person who has possession of the goods.

The consumer must also give to the credit provider or sheriff, on request, the address where the goods are kept, and the name and address of the landlord of the premises.

=== Rights of credit providers ===
The credit provider's most important rights are

* the right to enforce the agreement;
* the right to receive payment of the credit extended, together with agreed interest and fees; and,
* upon breach of contract, the right to cancel the agreement and recover any goods sold.

A credit provider may suspend a credit facility (like a credit card or cheque account) at any time if the consumer is in default, or otherwise close the facility on ten business days’ notice.

A credit provider who has incurred costs in the attachment of goods while enforcing a debt may ask a court to order the consumer to pay the costs of attachment. The court will make such an order only if the consumer provided false information about his address or the location of the goods.

=== Duties of credit providers ===
Every consumer right entails a duty on the part of credit providers. The duties on credit providers are onerous; they provide many administrative burdens. Some of the credit provider's more important duties are

* to register as a credit provider once it has 100 credit agreements or a book debt of R500,000;
* to make a credit assessment of the consumer;
* to give to the consumer a pre-agreement statement and quotation;
* to give to the consumer a copy of the agreement;
* to give to the consumer periodic statements of account, and further statements on request;
* to protect the confidentiality of information about consumers;
* to report to the NCR, or to a credit bureau, the details of every credit agreement concluded, as well as the termination of the agreement when the debt has been paid in full;
* to propose to the consumer to seek advice when the consumer is in default;
* to maintain records of credit applications, agreements and accounts as prescribed in the Regulations;
* to sell goods subject to a credit agreement as soon as possible, for the best price possible, should the consumer request it, and to provide the consumer with a financial statement.

== Over-indebtedness and reckless credit ==
Over-indebtedness is frequently a disastrous consequence of the high cost of credit. Levenstein summarises this state of affairs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unfortunately, in South Africa, too many people with too little money have been given too much credit. This ultimately leads to over-indebtedness which results in a never-ending circle of frustration for the consumer who can never repay his debts.&lt;ref&gt;Without Prejudice (2006) 6 at page 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Department of Trade and Industry's 2004 policy framework describes credit as “a double-edged sword:”

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whilst credit allows access to products or services that cannot be acquired out of a single month’s income, it can also be a dangerous instrument that can lead to high levels of debt and indebtedness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is quite easy for credit to lead to financial hardship and destroy a household’s wealth. Taking on extra loans in order to pay back existing loans can lead people into a debt spiral out of which it may be difficult to escape. Over-indebtedness has a negative impact on families and has in some extreme cases even led to family suicides. Over-indebtedness further has an impact upon the workplace, can lead to de-motivation, absenteeism and even a propensity to commit theft.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A Human Sciences Research Council survey on household indebtedness in South Africa showed that, in 2000, over sixty per cent of the regular disposable income of households earning less than R5,000 per year was used to service debt: that is, to pay interest on debt. Levels of indebtedness increased by more than 200 per cent between 1995 and 2000 in the poorest households, with incomes of less than R25,000 per year. This trend seems to have continued since.

It has been argued that consumers are often to blame for allowing themselves to become over-indebted by unwisely borrowing too much money, or by buying too much on credit. This is usually the result of economic desperation and lack of understanding of the difficulties of repaying or servicing their debt. Credit providers are, however, often to blame for recklessly giving too much credit to consumers who cannot afford to service their debt. One of the most important objectives of the Act is to combat over-indebtedness and reckless credit granting. Sections 78 to 88 of the Act contain detailed, far-reaching and extremely important provisions in this regard.

=== Over-indebtedness ===
A consumer is over-indebted if the available information indicates that the consumer is unable to pay the amounts due under a credit agreement in time. When deciding whether or not a consumer is over-indebted, a court must consider the consumer's

*  financial means (primarily income);
* financial prospects (income-earning potential);
* other debt; and
* history of debt repayment.

In any court proceedings, a court may declare a consumer to be over-indebted. Alternatively, a debt counsellor may have a role in one of two ways:

# A court may refer a consumer to a debt counsellor for a recommendation as to whether or not the consumer is over-indebted.
# A consumer may apply in person to a debt counsellor to be declared over-indebted (although this is not permitted if the credit provider has already taken steps to recover the debt). The consumer must apply by completing and submitting Form 16 to the Regulations. The consumer must provide details of the debt and pay a fee of R50 to the debt counsellor.

A debt review must then take place. The debt counsellor must notify all credit providers and credit bureaux listed in the application; they must co-operate fully with the debt counsellor. The debt counsellor must then evaluate the consumer's indebtedness. The evaluation can have one of three possible results:

# The consumer is over-indebted. The debt counsellor may recommend to the magistrate's court thatone or more credit agreements be declared reckless, and/or that one or more of the consumer's debts be re-arranged (for example, by extending the period of a contract and requiring smaller payments, and/or by postponing the dates of payments).
# The consumer is not over-indebted, but is having difficulty paying his debts on time. The counsellor may recommend that the consumer and credit providers try voluntarily to agree on a plan of debt re-arrangement, which may be filed as a consent order in court. If no agreement can be reached, the debt counsellor may make a recommendation to the court, which may make an appropriate order.
# The consumer is not over-indebted, and the application is rejected. The consumer may then apply himself to the magistrate's court for a debt review by completing and submitting Form 18 to the Regulations.

A credit agreement may be declared to be reckless only if the consumer is found to be over- indebted. If the debt counsellor finds that the consumer is not over-indebted, but is of the view that one or more credit agreements are reckless, these agreements may not be declared to be reckless. Credit providers may therefore still enforce credit agreements that are in fact reckless, but they may not be formally declared to be reckless.

While this process is under way, a consumer may not use his credit facility (for example, his credit card); nor may he enter into another credit agreement. A credit provider who enters into a credit agreement with a consumer while the consumer is under debt review runs the risk of the credit agreement's being declared reckless credit.

Also, if a consumer is in default under a credit agreement, and the credit provider has already commenced debt-enforcement proceedings, that agreement may not be subject to the debt review. This could encourage credit providers to start proceedings to recover debt earlier than they otherwise might have done.

The debt-review procedure might well be used by shrewd consumers to delay or avoid payment under a credit agreement. This is so because there are many provisions in the Act which limit the rights of credit providers to enforce debts under review. However, if the consumer is in default under a credit agreement subject to review, the credit provider may give notice to the consumer, the debt counsellor and the NCR to terminate the review. This notice may be given at least sixty days after the date of application for debt review: that is, if the debt-review process is dragging on too long. The credit provider may then take steps to enforce the agreement. The court then has the discretion to order that the debt review resume if appropriate. Finally, it should be noted that an application for debt review by a consumer has serious implications for the consumer as to his creditworthiness and the conclusion of future agreements.

=== Reckless credit ===
A credit provider must not enter into a reckless credit agreement with a consumer. Before entering into a credit agreement, a credit provider must first take reasonable steps to assess the consumer's

* general understanding of the risks and costs of the proposed credit;
* debt repayment history; and
* existing financial means, prospects and obligations.

A credit agreement is reckless

* if, at the time it was concluded, the credit provider failed to conduct the necessary assessment (described above), irrespective of what the outcome of the assessment might have been; or
* if the credit provider entered into the agreement despite the fact that information available to the credit provider after the assessment showed that
** the consumer did not generally understand the consumer's risk and the costs or obligations under the proposed credit agreement; or
** the conclusion of the agreement would cause the consumer to become over-indebted.

This provision helps to prevent credit providers from taking shortcuts by simply accepting seemingly creditworthy debtors at face value. A credit provider may use its own assessment mechanisms, provided these are fair and objective. The consumer, in turn, must fully and truthfully provide the requested information. Failure by the consumer to do so could provide the credit provider with a complete defence to an allegation of reckless credit granting.

In any proceedings that concern credit agreements, a court may declare that a credit agreement is reckless, in which case the court may make an order

* setting aside all or part of the consumer's rights and obligations under that agreement (so that, for example, the consumer may not have to repay a loan or pay the instalments on a credit sale at all); or
* suspending the force and effect of the agreement for a specific period.

If a court declares that a specific credit agreement is reckless, it must also decide whether or not the consumer is over-indebted at the time of the court proceedings. All the debt of the consumer must be considered. If the court finds the consumer to be over-indebted, it may make an order

* suspending the force and effect of that agreement for a specific period; and
* restructuring the consumer's obligations under any other credit agreements.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;See above.&lt;/ref&gt;

While an agreement is suspended (not set aside),

* the consumer is not required to pay anything in terms of the credit agreement;
* no interest or fee may be debited to the consumer; and
* the credit provider's rights in terms of the agreement are unenforceable.

After the period of suspension ends, all the parties’ rights and obligations are revived and become enforceable again. However, interest or fees that would normally have accrued during the period of suspension may not be charged to the consumer. This is a drastic remedy indeed.

The reckless-credit provisions do not apply to a number of credit agreements, including

* a school loan;
* a student loan; and
* an emergency loan.

A student loan, for example, could be granted to an unemployed consumer, who might not have a credit record (so that the credit provider does not know his payment history). The consumer might not be creditworthy, and there is no security. The nature of these agreements excludes them from being reckless lending.

The negative results for credit providers of either

* contracting with over-indebted consumers; or
* concluding reckless credit agreements

are serious. Many of the provisions are designed to penalise credit providers. Credit providers will be very careful to reduce the risk of bad debt. These provisions are therefore likely to reduce over-indebtedness and reckless credit granting, at least in the formal sector. A negative result for consumers, however, could be that credit grantors will be much more reluctant to grant credit in the future, and that, therefore, fewer people will be able to access credit. Further, this could lead to an increase in the number of unregistered and illegal credit providers.

== The cost of credit ==
It is critical that one understand the full implications of the new cost-of-credit provisions in the
National Credit Act and Regulations.

=== Interest rates until 1 June 2007 ===
Until June 1, 2007, the Usury Act (which has now been repealed by the National Credit Act) prescribed limits on the interest rates that credit providers could charge. Until this date, the maximum interest rate was twenty per cent per year on all credit agreements up to R10,000 and seventeen per cent per year on credit agreements over R10,000. However, registered micro-lenders were made exempt from the Usury Act from 1992, meaning that they were entitled to charge whatever interest rates they liked. This resulted in exorbitant interest rates, with micro-lenders charging typically thirty per cent per month (or 360 per cent per year)—eighteen times more than the limit of twenty per cent per year for other credit. Because of the enormous profits that micro-lenders could make, the industry spiralled out of control, growing rapidly year-on-year. In the three years between September 2003 and August 2006, for example, industry disbursements more than doubled. The industry grew by an average of over thirty per cent per year. For the twelve months ending August 2006, the total Rand-value of loans disbursed in the registered micro-finance sector was over R30,000,000,000.

=== The socio-economic impact of excessive interest rates ===
Excessive interest rates have caused terrible socio-economic hardships and suffering for low-income individuals and communities. A high percentage of personal income is used to service micro-lending debt, leaving very little of borrowers’ personal income to pay for other household expenses. Borrowers on thirty-day loans in particular are very soon caught in debt traps from which they are unable to escape. Tens of billions are lost to lower-income communities in the form of interest on micro-loans every year, contributing to the perpetuation of poverty.

Levels of indebtedness are high and appear to be increasing. The problem of over-indebtedness is made worse by high levels of consumption finance and consumer ignorance and illiteracy. (32 per cent of the adult population of South Africa were functionally illiterate in 2001.) By allowing the micro-lending industry to function without legislated and enforced interest-rate limits since 1992, the Government effectively made possible the exploitation of the ignorance of lower-income communities, which arguably amounted to legislated economic abuse.

=== The cost of credit in terms of the National Credit Act ===
The National Credit Act prescribes limits on interest rates for all forms of credit, including micro-loans. However, the Act introduces other fees (the initiation fee and the service fee) which cause the total cost of credit to remain extremely high. No longer is it sufficient to consider only interest rates. Interest rates, initiation fees and service fees must all be carefully calculated in order to work out the total cost of credit for borrowers. The new cost-of-credit provisions came into force on June 1, 2007.

==== Interest ====
Different interest rates apply to different categories of credit agreements:

===== Short-term credit transactions =====
“Short-term credit transactions” are agreements up to R8,000 repayable within six months; usually these are micro-loans. The maximum interest rate permitted is five per cent per month, or sixty per cent per year.

===== Unsecured credit transactions =====
“Unsecured credit transactions” are agreements for which there is no security for the debt at all (like loans or sales on credit). There is no limit on the amount or repayment period. Unsecured agreements for more than R8,000 and/or repayable over more than six months fall into this category. The maximum interest rate is linked to the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) Repurchase Rate ((Repurchase Rate x 2.2) + 20% per year), and is currently 39,8 per cent per year (based on the current repo rate of nine per cent). This maximum rate is nearly double the maximum permissible rate in terms of the Usury Act that applied until May 31, 2007 (20 per cent per year). Sales of furniture, for example, could now cost twice as much to service.

===== Credit facilities =====
Secured bank loans, credit card or cheque accounts fall under the category “credit facility.” The maximum interest rate is also linked to the SARB Bank Repurchase Rate, and is currently 29.8 per cent per year.

===== Developmental credit agreements =====
“Developmental credit agreements” are credit agreements entered into to develop a small business, an educational loan, or a loan for purposes of building low-cost housing. The maximum interest rate is 38.8% per year.

===== Mortgage bond agreements =====
For mortgage bond agreements, the maximum interest rate is 24.9 per cent per year.

==== The initiation fee ====
The initiation fee is intended to cover the costs of initiating a credit agreement, although it is not clear exactly what costs the fee is intended to cover. It is a once-off payment made by the consumer on conclusion of the credit agreement or payable in instalments (as a separate loan attracting interest).

The maximum initiation fee in terms of the Regulations is R150 per credit agreement, plus ten per cent of the amount of the agreement in excess of R1,000, but never to exceed R1,000. Also, the initiation fee may never exceed fifteen per cent of the principal debt.

[[File:Table A - Maximum initiation fees for different size loans.png|thumb|Examples of the calculation of maximum initiation fees for different-size credit agreements.]]

It will be extremely difficult for consumers to find the necessary cash to pay the initiation fee up front at a time when they are taking out a loan precisely because they are in need of cash. Most lenders will thus be unable to afford to pay the initiation fee on taking out a loan, particularly in the case of the very poor borrowing for consumption purposes. These people will thus be forced to allow the initiation fee to be capitalised and re-paid, probably in the same number of instalments as the initial loan, and subject to the same interest rate as the initial loan. The result will be that the effective monthly cost of credit will increase.

==== The service fee ====
The service fee is defined as a fee that may be charged periodically (usually monthly) by a credit provider in connection with the routine administrative cost of maintaining a credit agreement. The maximum service fee in terms of the Regulations is R50 per month, or R600 per year. The same “flat-rate” maximum service fee of R50 is applicable to all categories and sizes of credit agreements. It appears that the service fee was standardised in order to simplify the application of the Act, justifiable on the basis that every loan, no matter what its size, needs to be administered.

[[File:Table B - The effective cost of the service fee on different size loans.png|thumb|The effect of the flat-rate service fee of R50 per month on different size loans in terms of South African law, shown as a percentage of the loan amount.]]

The smaller the loan, the more expensive will be the service fee relative to the loan. When this cost is shown as a percentage, it is clear that the service fee adds significantly to the cost of the loan, increasing rapidly with smaller and smaller loan amounts. The “flat-rate” service fee of R50 per month is exorbitant in the case of small loans of less than R1,000 and is still too high in the case of loans up to R5,000.

This result is so unfair that borrowers of very small loans (who are almost invariably from the poorest communities) will be discriminated against. The Act itself provides that the service fee must vary relative to the principal debt: that is, that it should be higher for bigger loans, and lower for smaller loans. This is not so. The Regulations should be amended to set the service fee at a percentage of the loan amount, subject to both a minimum and a maximum rand amount (as is the case for the initiation fee). Alternatively, the service fee should be scrapped on smaller credit agreements, and the maximum interest rate increased if necessary. If the service fee is not amended or scrapped, then it should be challenged in court.

==== Maximum limits and probable market costs ====
The prescribed interest rates and fees are maximum amounts only. The Department of Trade and Industry hopes that the credit industry will not “jump to the maximum rates”, and has said that it has the power to adjust these rates quickly if necessary.

The micro-lending industry in particular was born and grew on the strength of exorbitant interest rates, and many micro-lenders will struggle to stay in business with the new limits in place. It is therefore very likely that most lenders will charge the maximum rates of interest and fees to keep their profits as high as possible. Bigger lenders such as banks, on the other hand, are able to afford to be competitive, and are likely to charge lower rates.

==== The danger of masking the total cost of credit ====
The drastic reduction in interest rates has the effect of masking or obscuring the true total cost of credit when the initiation and service fees are added. It is possible that these fees could to a large extent remain hidden, with the emphasis being placed on interest rates (which are more familiar to consumers) when products are marketed. The fees help to keep interest rates lower, which makes credit look cheaper, when in fact credit may not be cheaper. The skewing of credit costs away from interest and towards fees (which are not familiar to consumers) will increase the chances of consumers’ being misled as to the actual cost of credit. Many will be lured into borrowing money which will cost much more than they had initially expected. It is essential that paralegals understand the danger of this masking of the true cost of credit, in order to be able to warn their clients of this danger.

==== The combined impact of interest, the initiation fee and the service fee ====
[[File:Table C - Illustration of the cost of credit in terms of the National Credit Regulations.png|thumb|The total cost of credit (for either short-term or unsecured loans) applied to a number of loan amounts and loan periods. The total cost of credit (for either short-term or unsecured loans) is applied here to a number of loan amounts and loan periods. The total monthly cost of credit is indicated in rands; this rand amount is indicated as a monthly percentage of the initial loan. This monthly percentage gives the most accurate possible indication of the total cost of credit in each case. The annual cost may be obtained by multiplying these figures by twelve. It is assumed for the purposes of these calculations that the maximum rates of interest and fees are charged, for the reasons explained above. It is also assumed that the total initiation fee is charged to the borrower and capitalised: that is to say, is paid off over the same period as the loan, at the same interest rate (five per cent per month if it is a short-term loan, or 3.3 per cent per month if it is an unsecured loan). If the initiation fee were regarded as a separate loan, it would attract its own initiation and service fees, which would make the initiation fee even more expensive. For the sake of simplicity, interest is not charged on unpaid interest and other fees (although this is permitted by the Act), which would make the total cost of credit even more expensive.]]

The new credit limits have a negative impact on smaller loans. The smaller the loan, the more expensive it is. A one-month loan of R500 will cost about the same as the typical thirty per cent per month charged prior to the Act. Smaller loans will be even more expensive than that. A R200 loan will cost 46 per cent per month (552 per cent per year), which is more than nine times the maximum interest of five per cent per month.

The positive impact of capped interest rates, furthermore, is negated by the high maximum initiation and service fees.

The impact of the initiation and service fees on smaller loans amounts to a skewing of the cost of credit away from interest and towards these fees, so that interest decreases relative to these fees. This skewing has the dangerous effect of masking the true cost of credit from the consumer, and of misleading the consumer.

A more equitable result could be achieved by removing or reducing the initiation and service fees, reducing the maximum permissible interest rate, and reducing the maximum size amount of short-term credit transactions. This will require amendments to the Regulations.

=== The socio-economic consequences of the new cost of credit ===
The new structure for costing of credit will work best for the biggest credit advances, in excess of R8,000. The cost of credit on agreements of less than R1,000 is comparable with the typical thirty per cent per month charged with no interest limits on small loans, The vast majority of borrowers of micro-loans are from low-income groups. The poorest households carry the greatest debt-servicing burden. Low-income individuals and communities who borrow small amounts are therefore likely to continue to suffer the same devastating socio-economic hardships referred to above, contributing to the perpetuation of poverty.

Borrowers of one-month loans are most vulnerable, since these loans are much more expensive than other short-term loans. Low-income borrowers are usually unable to afford to pay back these loans at the end of the month; repeated loans have often to be taken out to fund in full the re-payment of previous loans. Borrowers are caught in debt spirals and subsequent debt traps, with the disastrous consequence that borrowers in effect remain permanently indebted.

[[File:Table D - Illustration of the application of the new cost of credit to one-month loans and resultant debt spiral.png|thumb|The new cost of credit, applied to two examples. In each case, the cost of credit is calculated as follows: interest at 5% per month + initiation fee at 15% of loan amount (+ 5% interest per month) + service fee (always R50). In Example A, by Month 2 the loan repayment (R840) has already exceeded the old-age pension of R820. In Example B, the loan repayment in Month 3 almost exceeds the total wage. These examples confirm that debt spirals and debt traps will continue to occur on a wide scale when the new cost of credit is applied, and could prove to be one of its greatest dangers.]]

=== Conclusion ===
The National Credit Act has made great strides towards consumer protection, and the new limits on interest rates will provide welcome relief for many borrowers. The combined effect of interest, the initiation fee and the service fee will, however, cause the cost of credit on small loans to remain exorbitant. This will have a devastating negative impact on poorer individuals and communities.

== Legal remedies provided by the Act ==
The Act provides only a relatively short list of offences that attract criminal penalties. By contrast, the Usury Act provided that any person who contravenes any provision of the Act commits an offence. Thus, for example, it was a criminal offence to charge interest higher than the Usury Act maximum, which is no longer the case.

However, the Act does provide a number of civil legal remedies for consumers, some of which are drastic departures from previous law. The most important of these remedies are outlined below.

=== Unlawful credit agreements ===
Section 89 lists a number of credit agreements that are unlawful, including

* an agreement with a consumer who is a minor unassisted by a guardian;
* an agreement with a person who has been declared mentally unfit;
* an agreement with a person under an administration order without the administrator's consent;
* an agreement resulting from negative-option marketing (explained above);
* an agreement with an unregistered credit provider who was supposed to be registered (unless application for registration is made within thirty days after the credit agreement was concluded);&lt;ref&gt;See above for how to establish whether or not a credit provider is registered.&lt;/ref&gt; and
* an agreement with a credit provider who was subject to a notice by the NCR to stop extending credit.

If a credit agreement is found to be unlawful, a court must order

* that the credit agreement is void;
* that the credit provider refund to the consumer any monies paid by the consumer, with interest; and
* that the credit provider's rights to recover monies paid or goods delivered to the consumer be cancelled or forfeited to the State (if the court is of the view that the consumer would otherwise be unjustifiably enriched).

The credit provider will not get back the money lent or property sold, and the court does not have a discretion to order this. This is a drastic remedy and a departure from the common law. It was not previously available in the case of unregistered micro-lenders, and is a significant new remedy readily available to consumers.

Thus, for example, a court will be able to declare a loan from an unregistered micro-lender to be void (if the Act requires the micro-lender to be registered), and order the micro-lender to refund all instalments paid, with interest. Furthermore, the court must order that the loan amount paid to the consumer be retained by the borrower or forfeited to the State. The amount loaned is therefore lost to the unregistered micro-lender altogether.

=== Unlawful provisions of credit agreements ===
Section 90 lists numerous provisions of credit agreements (as opposed to the entire agreements&lt;ref&gt;s 89.&lt;/ref&gt;) that are unlawful and not permitted. They are too many to list here. The list is broadly-worded and far-reaching; many of the provisions will probably be open to a wide range of interpretations, which is likely to lead to uncertainty. For example, a provision is unlawful if its general purpose or effect is to defeat the purposes or policies of the Act, or to “deceive” the consumer. Further, a provision is unlawful

* if it avoids a credit provider's obligation or duty in terms of the Act;
* if it sets aside or overrides the effect of any provision of the Act;
* if it authorises the credit provider to do anything that is unlawful in terms of the Act, or to fail to do anything that is required in terms of the Act;
* if it waives or deprives a consumer of a right afforded by the Act;
* if it waives any common-law rights applicable to the credit agreement;
* if it expresses the consumer's consent to a pre-determined value of costs of enforcement of the agreement;
* if it expresses the consumer's consent to the jurisdiction of the High Court, or any court that would normally not have jurisdiction for reasons of its geographical location;
* if it provides for the consumer's depositing an identity document, credit or debit or access card, or providing a PIN;
* if it authorises a person acting on behalf of the credit provider to enter premises to repossess goods; or
* if it contains an undertaking to sign in advance any documentation relating to the enforcement of the agreement (like a consent to judgment or emoluments-attachment order).

An unlawful provision is void. Whenever a court has a matter before it which concerns a credit agreement that contains an unlawful provision, the court may

* sever (remove) the unlawful provision from the credit agreement;
* alter the provision to render it lawful; or
* even declare the whole credit agreement unlawful and make orders similar to those provided for unlawful credit agreements, set out above (another major departure from the common law).

The consumer alleging the unlawful provision is entitled to apply to court for orders in these terms.

Thus, for example, if a credit agreement for the sale of furniture provides for interest or fees in excess of the maximum amounts permissible, a court must declare the offending provisions to be void and enforce the remainder of the agreement. However, it seems that the court may be able to declare the entire agreement void, order the furniture shop to refund all amounts paid, and order that the furniture sold be retained by the borrower or forfeited to the State.

=== In duplum rule ===
The Act has codified the in duplum rule for the first time in South Africa's legislative history, and extended the rule further to include all credit costs. This rule states that, while a consumer is in default, all credit costs will stop being added to the debt when their total equals the unpaid balance of the principal debt. It is likely that increased use will be made of the rule since it has been legislated. It must be remembered, however, that it will apply only when the consumer is in default.

=== Reckless credit and over-indebtedness ===
Other legal remedies for consumers already discussed above include

* a court order declaring a loan agreement to be reckless, which could result in the setting aside of all or part of the borrower's rights and obligations under the agreement, or the suspension of the force and effect of the agreement for a determined period; and
* a finding that a consumer was over-indebted at the time of the conclusion of the agreement, in which event the court may order the suspension of the force and effect of the agreement and the restructuring of the consumer's obligations under any other credit agreements.

== Dispute settlement and debt enforcement ==

=== Dispute settlement ===
If the Act has been contravened, a person has one of two options:

# to lodge a complaint with the NCR; or
# to make use of one of the other dispute-resolution mechanisms established by the Act.

==== Lodging a complaint with the NCR ====
The Act contains detailed provisions regarding the role of the NCR.&lt;ref&gt;ss 136-141.&lt;/ref&gt; Complaints to the NCR must be lodged by completing and submitting to the NCR Form 29 to the Regulations. The NCR may resolve complaints lodged with it; the resolution may become a consent order by a court or the Tribunal. The NCR may also refer the dispute to a debt counsellor, an ombud with jurisdiction or a consumer court. After investigating the matter, the NCR may refer the matter to a provincial consumer court or the Tribunal for an order allowed by the Act.

==== Other dispute-resolution methods ====
Alternatively, disputes may be referred for resolution directly to the relevant ombud if the credit provider is a financial institution (like a bank), to a consumer court or to an alternative dispute resolution agent.&lt;ref&gt;ss 134-135.&lt;/ref&gt; With the consent of the parties, the resolution may be recorded in writing and made an order of court or the Tribunal.

In his book ''The National Credit Act Explained'', Otto concludes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;All in all, the muscle of the National Credit Regulator, the far-reaching powers of the National Consumer Tribunal and the courts, the almost paternalistic protective inclination of the legislature, and the extensive network of dispute-solving account for consumer legislation that is going to have a huge impact on the enormous credit industry in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Debt enforcement ===
The Act limits the credit provider's common-law rights to enforce debt: that is, to claim what is due in terms of the credit agreement. This is in line with international consumer legislation, but the Act's provisions have been criticised as being unusually cumbersome and detrimental to credit providers.&lt;ref&gt;Visagie 2006 De Rebus at page 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Default notice to the consumer ====
If a consumer is in default, the credit provider must notify the consumer of his default in writing. This is effectively a letter of demand. The notice must do more, however: The credit provider must propose to the consumer that the consumer refer the credit agreement to, among others, a debt counsellor to resolve the dispute or agree on a plan to get payments up to date.

As regards the method of delivery of the written default notice, the consumer may choose to be informed in one or more of these ways:

* in person at the credit provider's business premises;
* at any other place chosen by the consumer, at the consumer's expense; or
* by ordinary mail fax or email or printable web-page.

Must the default notice actually reach the consumer to be effective? The Constitutional Court held in Sebola v Standard Bank&lt;ref&gt;2012 (5) SA 142 (CC).&lt;/ref&gt; that the Act, although it gives no clear meaning to “deliver,” requires that the credit provider, in seeking to enforce a credit agreement, must aver and prove that the notice was delivered to the consumer. Where the credit provider posts the notice, proof of registered despatch to the address of the consumer, together with proof that the notice reached the appropriate post office for delivery to the consumer, will constitute sufficient proof of delivery (in the absence of contrary indication).

==== Debt procedures in court ====
A credit provider may go to court to enforce a credit agreement only if

* the consumer has been in default for at least 20 business days;
* at least ten business days have elapsed since the credit provider delivered the default notice;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* the consumer has not responded to the notice or responded by rejecting the proposals in the notice;
* the consumer has not surrendered to the credit provider the goods subject to the credit agreement him/herself (in the case of an instalment agreement, secured loan or lease agreement).&lt;ref&gt;See below.&lt;/ref&gt;

The twenty days and ten days referred to above may run concurrently: that is, the ten-day period may occur during the 20-day period.

Where a case has been referred to the National Consumer Tribunal, debt counsellor, ombud, alternative-dispute-resolution agent or consumer court, or the credit agreement is subject to a debt review, the court will adjourn the case.

A much larger number of requests for default judgment on credit agreements now have to be referred to a magistrate,&lt;ref&gt;s 2(5) of the Magistrates’ Courts Act.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than being dealt with by the clerk of the court. This will greatly increase the workload of the magistrates, and could cause debt enforcement procedures to take much longer, resulting in frustration for credit providers.

==== Attachment and sale of goods ====
If a credit provider properly cancels a credit agreement, the court may order the attachment of the goods, allowing for the sale of the goods to settle the account. This procedure follows the usual common law.

If the proceeds of the sale are not sufficient to settle the account, the credit provider may approach the court for an order to recover the outstanding balance. This applies in the case of the instalment agreement, secured loan or lease. Strangely absent from this list is the mortgage agreement. This implies that the mortgagee (a bank, usually) will be able to rely only on the proceeds of the sale of the property to settle the account—even if this is insufficient, and even if the mortgagor (the debtor) is very wealthy and has other assets that could be attached.

==== Interim attachment orders ====
Common practice is that a credit provider asks the court for an “interim attachment order,” pending cancellation of the agreement, in order to protect goods at risk (like a motor car) from deterioration or damage. This order will allow the sheriff to attach the goods for safekeeping until such time as the court action is finalised, which can take a long time. It is not clear from the Act whether or not credit providers will still be able to obtain interim attachment orders. The past practice of obtaining such orders may well continue.

==== Re-instatement of credit agreement by consumer ====
At any time before cancellation, a consumer may reinstate a credit agreement that is in default by paying all amounts overdue, plus default charges and the costs of enforcing the debt to date. The consumer may then repossess property attached, but not if the goods have already been sold.

==== Surrender of goods ====
The consumer may choose at any time to surrender the goods that are subject to the credit agreement, whether or not the consumer is in default. This provision is discussed in detail above.

==== Unlawful collection practices ====
A credit provider may not use an identity document, credit or debit card, access card or PIN to enforce a credit agreement or collect on the agreement. A contravention of this provision is a criminal offence.

'''David Kenneth Roy Thomson, 3rd Baron Thomson of Fleet''' (born 12 June 1957) is a Canadian [[hereditary peer]] and [[Media proprietor|media]] [[Business magnate|magnate]].&lt;ref name=globe/&gt; Upon the death of his father in 2006, Thomson became the chairman of [[Thomson Corporation]] and also inherited his father's British title, [[Baron Thomson of Fleet]]. After the acquisition of [[Reuters]] in 2008, Thomson became the chairman of the merged entity, [[Thomson Reuters]].

As of July 2018, Thomson is listed as one of the wealthiest people in the world, with an estimated net worth of $25 billion.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg Billionares Index"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bloomberg Billionares Index |accessdate=December 3, 2012 |url=http://topics.bloomberg.com/bloomberg-billionaires-index/ |publisher=Bloomberg LP |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214085457/http://topics.bloomberg.com/bloomberg-billionaires-index/ |archivedate=December 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
He is the eldest child of the late [[Kenneth Thomson, 2nd Baron Thomson of Fleet]] and his wife, the late Marilyn Lavis.&lt;ref name=globe&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/beloved-matriarch-of-the-thomson-family/article35197589/ |title=Beloved matriarch of the Thomson family |work=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sister is Taylor Thomson and his brother is [[Peter Thomson (race car driver)|Peter Thomson]], a venture capitalist and race car driver.

In 1978, Thomson received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] (subsequently upgraded to an [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA (Cantab)]]) at [[Selwyn College, Cambridge| Selwyn College, University of Cambridge]] where he studied history. As a child, he attended both [[Upper Canada College]] and the Hall School.He was also a part of New England.

==Business career==
Thomson started his business career as a junior associate at McLeod Young Weir in Toronto. He left the firm to enter the family business, working in a number of positions in companies controlled by the Thomson family. Thomson was manager of [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|The Bay]] store at [[Cloverdale Mall]] in [[Etobicoke]], and president of [[Zellers]]. In an effort to develop his independence, Thomson founded the real estate firm Osmington Incorporated, owned and operated outside of the Thomson empire. Osmington acquires and manages commercial real estate assets on behalf of institutional shareholders. In 2010, Osmington sold its stake in eight retail properties to the Canada Pension Plan for $336 million. Osmington is a major investor in FarmersEdge, a precision agriculture company. Osmington is also a partner in [[True North Sports and Entertainment]], owners of the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Winnipeg Jets]] and the [[Bell MTS Place]] in downtown [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=367433 True North buys Thrashers, set to move team to Winnipeg]. Tsn.ca. Retrieved on 2013-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Osmington is redeveloping the retail space of Toronto's Union Station. Thomson's investment activities are managed through Toronto [[hedge fund]] Morgan Bay Capital, which he created with longtime financial advisor, foreign exchange trader and ''consigliere'', Patrick M. Phillips, vice president of Woodbridge, the Thomson family holding company.

According to a plan devised decades ago by [[Thomson Corporation]] founder [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Roy Thomson]], when [[Kenneth Thomson]] died (in June 2006), control of the family fortune passed on to David.&lt;ref name=austentorch&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/03/business/media/03thomson.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print "In Canada, the Torch is Passed on a Quiet but Profitable Legacy,"] by Ian Austen, The New York Times (Business Day section) p. C1, July 3, 2006; accessed on July 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Thomson Reuter's sale of a controlling stake in its financial business in 2018, Thomson expressed frustrations working in the family business.  He is currently engaged in discussions with family members to leave the family business, Thomson Reuters, to focus on his own art and real estate activities.  

"David, my grandson, will have to take his part in the running of the Organisation and David's son, too," Roy Thomson wrote in his 1975 autobiography. "With the fortune that we will leave to them go also responsibilities. These Thomson boys that come after Ken are not going to be able, even if they want to, to shrug off these responsibilities."&lt;ref name=austentorch/&gt;

== Art collection ==
Thomson is a noted art collector and owns works by [[Rembrandt]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Hammershoi]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Patrick Heron]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Ernst Ludvig Kirchner|E. L. Kirchner]], and [[Egon Schiele]].  Thomson owns the world's largest collection of paintings and drawings by the English painter John Constable.  In an interview with Geraldine Norman in ''The Independent'' in 1994, Thomson said he bought his first Constable drawing at 19, giving the seller "an oil painting in exchange and quite a lot of money".  Norman described him as a "fanatical collector", and Thomson described how he "fell in love" with Constable's style as a young child.  In his twenties, Thomson stunned the art world with two monumental purchases.  In 1984, he acquired J. M. W. Turner's spectacular 'Seascape: Folkestone", for a record £7.3 million (£21.8 million in 2017) from the sale of the collection of noted British art historian Kenneth Clark.  The following year, Thomson, 27,  broke another world record when he bought Rembrandt's monumental "Christ Presented to the People", from 1655, for a record £561,000 (£1.7 million in 2017) at Christie's London, when the Duke of Devonshire sold the Chatsworth Collection in one of the largest auctions of the time. Thomson sold both masterpieces within a few years during the 1980s financial crisis.

In 2002, Thomson and his father paid a world record price of $76.7 million to acquire Rubens' "[[Massacre of the Innocents (Rubens)|Massacre of the Innocents]]", now the centrepiece of the Thomson Collection at the Art Gallery of Ontario.  In 2012, Thomson shattered records buying a painting by Danish artist Vilhelm Hammershoi, "Ida Reading a Letter", paying the highest price ever for a Danish artist.  In 2012, Thomson broke the record for the most expensive 18th-century British watercolour when he paid £2.4 million for a small landscape by John Robert Cozens.

Thomson is an active acquirer of Canadian art. In 2007, Thomson paid $1.8 million for a face mask, the highest price ever paid for a single piece of Native North American art. An in November, 2016 he paid a record C$11.2 million to buy a painting at auction by Group of Seven artist Lawren Harris entitled "Mountain Forms". 

Thomson operates his collecting activities through his personal Thomson Works of Art. Thomson also funds the Archive of Modern Conflict, based in London.  Specialists within the archive purchase photography collections worldwide and also run a book-publishing arm, AMC Books,  which has a Canadian imprint, Bone Idle Books, based in Toronto.

==Personal life==
Thomson is the father of six children from four different mothers.  With his first wife, Mary Lou La Prairie, he has two daughters:  Thyra Nicole and Tessa Lys. With his second wife, Laurie Ludwick, Thomson has one son, Benjamin, born after Thomson left the marriage. With the actress Kelly Rowan, Thomson has a daughter, Braeylin, born after Thomson left the relationship.  With his partner Severine Nackers, an employee of Sotheby's in London, Thomson has two daughters, Ottilie, born in 2015, and Elodie, born in 2018.  None of the children live with their father. Thomson was estranged from his eldest daughter, Thyra, for five years, with Thyra eventually suing her father over mismanagement of the family trusts.  The case was settled out of court in 2017. Thomson lives alone in a private residence that also houses an underground art gallery, in Rosedale, Toronto.  Three of his children live in London, UK, where Thomson retains several homes. 
 
Thomson is a patron of the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]. With the death of his father, he became the 3rd [[Baron Thomson of Fleet]] on 12 June 2006, his 49th birthday. He does not use this title in Canada. He is an avid art collector and owns the world's top collection of [[John Constable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/News/article/227825|title=Billionaire Thomson to marry actress|author=Matthew Chung|publisher=thestar.com|location=Toronto|date=21 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson has rarely given interviews to the press and maintains a low public profile. "The only substantial interview he has given was to James FitzGerald, who wrote a book about the elite private school ([[Upper Canada College]]) they both attended in Toronto", according to a July 3, 2006, article in ''[[The New York Times]]''. "In his comments to Mr. FitzGerald 12 years ago, David had little positive to say about many people in the business world".&lt;ref name=austentorch/&gt; In the interview, Thomson said: "When you try to live a more balanced life, traditional businessmen think that you are not a real man. But who is not the real man? You are telling me? You have not taken a weekend with your wife, you have no spare time that you use constructively, you do not have any hobbies, you do not know how to spell Mozart. And here you are telling me that I am weak?"&lt;ref name=austentorch/&gt; He resides in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].&lt;ref name="FDT"&gt;{{cite web | title = David Thomson &amp; family | publisher = [[Forbes]] | url = https://www.forbes.com/profile/david-thomson | accessdate = January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EastPark''' is a 1000-acre (4&amp;nbsp;km²) industrial park located in the state of [[Kentucky]], [[United States]], at the junction of [[Boyd County, Kentucky|Boyd]], [[Greenup County, Kentucky|Greenup]], and [[Carter County, Kentucky|Carter]] counties, although most of the park resides in Greenup County. The park is operated by the Northeast Kentucky Regional Industrial Park Authority. The site of the park was donated to the state of Kentucky by [[Addington Enterprises]] from reclaimed land that had once been used as a [[strip mine]]. The state of Kentucky used the donated land to build the park and a two-lane highway, now known as the Industrial Parkway ([[Kentucky Route 67]]) This proved to be beneficial to both Addington and the state, as the land was not able to be developed without the road and it provided a way to connect [[US 23]] in Greenup County to [[Interstate 64]]. The park has a convenient location, as it is located where Interstate 64 and KY 67 intersect. EastPark is also connected to a port on the [[Ohio River]] in [[Wurtland, Kentucky]], via KY 67.

EastPark is located in the [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]]-[[Ashland, Kentucky|Ashland]], [[West Virginia|WV]]-[[Kentucky|KY]]-[[Ohio|OH]], [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA). As of the 2000 census, the MSA had a population of 288,649.

'''Faras Hamdan''' ({{lang-ar|فارس حمدان}}; {{lang-he|פארס חמדאן}}, born 1910, died 29 November 1966) was an [[Israeli Arab]] politician who served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for [[Agriculture and Development]] between 1951 and 1959.

==Biography==
Hamdan was born in [[Baqa al-Gharbiyye]] during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman era]]. In 1944 he was elected head of local council of his village, where he later established a citrus confectionery factory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=420 Faras Hamdan: Public Activities] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Israeli legislative election, 1951|1951]] he was elected to the Knesset as head of the Agriculture and Development list, which was associated with the ruling [[Mapai]] party. The party joined [[David Ben-Gurion]]'s government, but Hamdan did not receive a ministerial portfolio.

He was re-elected in [[Israeli legislative election, 1955|1955]], and again joined the governing coalition. For the [[Israeli legislative election, 1959|1959 elections]] the party was headed by [[Mahmud A-Nashaf]]. It won only one seat and Hamdan lost his place in the Knesset.

He died in 1966.

In the years following [[World War II]], large numbers of German civilians and captured soldiers were [[Forced labour|forced into labour]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces.  The topic of using Germans as forced labour for [[World War II reparations|reparations]] was first broached at the [[Tehran conference]] in 1943, where [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] premier [[Joseph Stalin]] demanded 4,000,000 German workers.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Davidson "The death and life of Germany: an account of the American occupation". p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
{{Main|Forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union}}

The largest group of forced laborers in the Soviet Union consisted of several million German prisoners of war.  Most German POW survivors of the forced labor camps in the Soviet Union were released in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,860030,00.html |title=Prisoners: Homecoming|work=Time|date=12 October 1953|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207035142/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,860030,00.html|archivedate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,888719,00.html|date=7 July 1952|title=2,500,000 Missing|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125204557/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,888719,00.html|archivedate=25 November 2010|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced labour of Germans occurred well into the 1960’s

Estimates of German POW casualties (in both East and West and cumulative for both the war and peace-time period) range from 600,000 to 1,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stern.de/politik/ausland/537667.html?eid=537265 stern-Serie: Besiegt, befreit, besetzt - Deutschland 1945–48] "Die Schätzungen über die Zahl der in Haft gestorbenen Männer schwanken zwischen 600 000 und einer Million. Nach Angaben des Suchdienstes des Deutschen Roten Kreuzes ist bis heute das Schicksal von 1,3 Millionen Kriegsgefangenen ungeklärt - sie gelten offiziell als vermisst."&lt;/ref&gt; According to the section of the German Red Cross dealing with tracing the captives, the ultimate fate of 1,300,000 German POWs in Allied custody is still unknown; they are still officially listed as missing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stern.de/politik/ausland/537667.html?eid=537265 stern-Serie: Besiegt, befreit, besetzt - Deutschland 1945–48]&lt;/ref&gt;

The capture and transfer of civilian ethnic Germans to the Soviet Union began as soon as countries with a German minority began to be overrun in 1944. Large numbers of civilians were taken from countries such as Romania, Yugoslavia, and from the eastern parts of Germany itself. For example, after Christmas 1944 between 27,000 and 30,000 ethnic Germans (aged 18–40) were sent to the USSR from Yugoslavia. Women made up 90% of the group. Most were sent to labor camps in the [[Donbass]] (Donets or Donez basin) where 16% of them died.&lt;ref&gt;''The Expulsion of 'German' Communities from Eastern Europe at the end of the Second World War'', Steffen Prauser and Arfon Rees, European University Institute, Florence. HEC No. 2004/1 p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
Many ethnic Germans living within the Polish pre-war borders, prior to their [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expulsion]], were used for years as forced labor in labor camps&lt;ref name="google books"&gt;Philipp Ther, Ana Siljak, "Redrawing nations: ethnic cleansing in East-Central Europe, 1944–1948" p.58 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=oGmTs2SceAgC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=forced+laborers+looked+when+they+arived+back+in+Germany&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false google books])&lt;/ref&gt; such as that run by [[Salomon Morel]]. Among these camps were [[Central Labour Camp Jaworzno]], [[Central Labour Camp Potulice]], [[Łambinowice]], [[Zgoda labour camp]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=198721097755610 HNET review of "An Exploration of the Inner Landscape of Experience"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These were former nazi concentration camps, that were used to imprison ethnic Germans as in [http://www.geschichtswerkstatt-europa.org/abgelaufenes-projekt-details/items/potulice.html%20 Potulice: One Place different memories]&lt;/ref&gt; The law authorising forced labour, Article 20 of the law on the exclusion of the enemy elements from society, also removed rights to Polish citizenship and all property owned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipn.gov.pl/eng/eng_swietoch_histor.html|title=Creation of Concentration, Extermination and Labor Camps|date=February 20, 2002|publisher=[[Institute of National Remembrance]]|quote=anyone who has not filed an application for rehabilitation, or whose application for rehabilitation has been denied, is subject to placement in seclusion (a camp) for an unspecified period of time and subject to forced labor, and forever loses public and honorary citizen rights and all property.|accessdate=2006-02-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060228092635/http://www.ipn.gov.pl/eng/eng_swietoch_histor.html|archivedate=2006-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The many camps were used during the process of the expulsions for the sake of "rehabilitating" Reichs- or Volksdeutsche, to decide if they could stay or go, but in reality this was a program of slave labor.&lt;ref name=EthnicGermansPolandandCzechRepublic&gt;[http://www.stefanwolff.com/working-papers/EthnicGermansPolandandCzechRepublic.pdf Ethnic Germans in Poland and the Czech Republic: A Comparative Evaluation] p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly 200,000 ethnic Germans died in the Soviet run concentration camps in Poland.&lt;ref name=EthnicGermansPolandandCzechRepublic /&gt;

Others were still amongst the rest of the population, but the Polish government had made several declarations that the German population should be exploited as forced labor, instructing a minimum of 60 hours work per week with no rights for breaks. The salaries were insufficient for survival, usually 25 or 50 percent of Polish salaries.&lt;ref name="google books"/&gt;

===Czechoslovakia===
The German-speaking population of the [[Sudetenland]] was, in the same case as Poland, expelled after the war. The expulsion was not indiscriminate, however, since as late as 1947, large numbers of skilled German workmen were still being detained.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Hoover]], [http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/marshall/large/documents/index.php?pagenumber=4&amp;documentdate=1947-02-26&amp;documentid=5166 Report, "German Agricultural and Food Requirements", February 26, 1947] p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Germans were forced to wear a white armband with the letter "N", for "Němec" signifying German in Czech to identify them (even German Jews had to wear it).&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Wasserstein, "Vanishing Diaspora: The Jews in Europe Since 1945" p.38, ([https://books.google.com/books?id=mP7Jt7RoPLgC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=white+armbands+with+the+letter+%22N%22+for+Nemec&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=white%20armbands%20with%20the%20letter%20%22N%22%20for%20Nemec&amp;f=false googlebooks])&lt;/ref&gt;

Czech Deputy Premier Petr Mareš has in the past, in vain, tried to arrange compensation for ethnic Germans who were forcibly resettled or used as forced labour after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/2003/03-06-20.rferl.html CZECH DEPUTY PREMIER WANTS TO ASSESS POSSIBLE COMPENSATION TO EXPELLED GERMANS] RFE/RL Newsline, 03-06-20. (accessed 2010-02-02)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Germany===
Many Germans in what would become [[East Germany]] were forced by the Communist authorities to work in German uranium mines producing the majority of the raw material of the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Life (magazine)|Life]] | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=60oEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | date = 1950-09-25 | issn = 0024-3019 | pages = 73–83 | title = The secret mines of Russia's Germany }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in the summer of 1946 the Soviets began explorations in the [[Erzgebirge]], and sealing off the old [[radium]] [[hot spring]]s by September of the same year. An initial workforce of four to five thousand was established, with another 20,000 called for by the end of the year.  The work was dangerous and stressful and the Soviets made no effort to improve it; as a result the mines became filled with forced labor conscripts and has been compared to a [[death march]] and the [[Gulag]]s of [[Kolyma]]. Quotas were repeatedly set and raised, and conscription took place without regard to health or work experience - mines became staffed with office workers, craftsmen and students with no mining experience. By 1948 workers were pulled away from factories and criminals from jails to staff the mines, as were POWs returning to Germany from the Soviet Union. Housing lagged behind the burgeoning workers (with many regions doubling in population between 1946 and 1951), worsening already difficult conditions. The mines were considered worse than a penal colony, but were controlled directly by Moscow and local governments were unable to help. When an extra 60,000 workers were called for in the summer of 1947, a wave of potential workers flooded into West Germany to avoid the mines including many citizens who would otherwise prefer to live in the communist East. Workers who began as volunteers were turned into forced labourers. In an effort to increase the number of labourers, women were increasingly recruited to the non-segregated mines, many of whom brought or were infected with venereal diseases, and were sexually exploited by the Russian guards. Workers who attempted to escape, whether conscripts or volunteers, were hunted down and returned to the mines. Eventually Germans would become more involved in the running of the mines, forming a joint company with Russia in 1956.&lt;ref name = Naimark&gt;{{cite book |author=Naimark, Norman M. |title=The Russians in Germany: a history of the Soviet Zone of occupation, 1945–1949 |publisher=Belknap Press of [[Harvard University Press]] |location=Cambridge |year=1995 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=MVSjHNKUKoEC&amp;pg=PA238#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 238–48] |isbn=0-674-78405-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to Section IV of the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)#Hague Convention of 1907|Hague Convention of 1907]], "The Laws and Customs of War on Land", the [[SHAEF]] "counter insurgency manual" included provisions for forced labor and hostage taking.&lt;ref&gt;Perry Biddiscombe, "Werwolf!: the history of the National Socialist guerrilla movement, 1944–1946", 1998. p.256&lt;/ref&gt;

===France and Low Countries===

German prisoners were forced to clear minefields in France and the [[Low Countries]].

According to [[Simon MacKenzie]], "callous self-interest and a desire for retribution played a role in the fate" of German prisoners, and he exemplifies by pointing out that sick or otherwise unfit prisoners were forcibly used for labour, and in France and the Low Countries this also included work such as highly dangerous mine-clearing; "by September 1945 it was estimated by the French authorities that two thousand prisoners were being maimed and killed each month in accidents"&lt;ref&gt;S. P. MacKenzie "The Treatment of Prisoners of War in World War II" The Journal of Modern History, Vol. 66, No. 3. (Sep., 1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;487–520.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Footnote to: K. W. Bohme, Zur Geschichte der deutschen Kriegsgefangenen des Zweiten Weltkrieges, 15 vols. (Munich, 1962–74), 1, pt. 1:x. (n. 1 above), 13:173; ICRC (n. 12 above), p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the 740,000 German prisoners transferred in 1945 by the U.S. for forced labour in France came from the [[Rheinwiesenlager]] camps, these forced labourers were already very weak, many weighing barely 50 [[kg]] (110 lbs).&lt;ref&gt;[http://zeitgeschichte.zdf.de/ZDFde/inhalt/21/0,1872,2065941,00.html?dr=1 ZDF.de - Zwischen Tod und Liebe] (accessed 2009-12-12) On a documentary by [[Guido Knopp]], "Die Gefangenen Folge 4", "...&amp;nbsp;Tausende deutsche Kriegsgefangene wurden in den Monaten nach der Kapitulation im Mai '45 nach Frankreich verschifft, wo sie unter lebensgefährlichen Bedingungen Minen räumen oder in Bergwerken arbeiten mussten." "Da man dringend Arbeiter für den Wiederaufbau benötigte, wurden insgesamt 740.000 deutsche Kriegsgefangene von den Amerikanern an die Franzosen überstellt. Diejenigen, die aus den Rheinwiesenlagern kamen, waren körperlich geschwächt, wogen kaum 50 Kilogramm. Zeitzeugen berichten von Misshandlungen und Scheinexekutionen."&lt;/ref&gt;

In retaliation for acts of resistance French occupation forces expelled more than 25,000 civilians from their homes. Some of these civilians were subsequently forced to clear minefields in [[Alsace]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry Biddiscombe, "Werwolf!: the history of the National Socialist guerrilla movement, 1944–1946", 1998. p.261&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In 1946, the UK had more than 400,000 prisoners, many had been transferred from POW camps in the U.S. and Canada. Many of these were used as forced labour, as a form of "reparations".&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky, Edward S. Herman, "After the Cataclysm: Postwar Indochina and the Reconstruction of Imperial Ideology" (1979) pp.&amp;nbsp;35–37 "In Britain there were some 400,000 German POWs. By Autumn 1944 they were being used for forced labour as a form of 'reparations'. repatriation began in September 1946 and continued until the summer of 1948, over three years after the German surrender. After the war, too, the POWs spent the harsh winter of 1945–1945 in tents in violation of the 1929 Geneva Convention. The POWs referred to themselves as 'slave labour', with some justice." "The psychological state of the POW changed 'from the anxiety and hope of the first half of 1946 to the depression and nihilism of 1948,' according to Henry Faulk."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Davidsson, "The Trial of the Germans: An Account of the Twenty-Two Defendants Before the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg", (1997) p.&amp;nbsp;518–519 "the Allies stated in 1943 their intention of using forced workers outside Germany after the war, and not only did they express the intention but they carried it out. Not only Russia made use of such labor. France was given hundreds of thousands of German prisoners of war captured by the Americans, and their physical condition became so bad that the American Army authorities themselves protested. In England and the United States, too, German prisoners of war were being put to work long after the surrender, and in Russia thousands of them worked until the mid-1950s."&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main reasons for their internment were political re-education ([[Wilton Park]]), and for non-officers employment as agricultural and other labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://veda.fsv.cuni.cz/doc/KonferenceRCS/plen_hellen.doc| title       = Revisiting the past:  German Prisoners of War and their legacy in Britain| author =J. A. Hellen| accessdate  =2009-12-14| quote = After the D-Day Invasion in June 1944, increasing numbers of German POW were trans-shipped to Britain, although the main movements were from the near-Continent and North America after May 1945 (Table 1). There were two main purposes for this transfer: screening, political re-education and de-nazification and, for non-officers, their employment as agricultural and other labour&amp;nbsp;... Conclusion: In summary, it can be argued that the main raison d'être of the camps, the political re-education of the Germans in Britain, had the unintended and long-term effect of re-educating the British themselves in their perceptions of and attitudes towards the German enemy in particular, and to Europeans in general.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC POWs 1"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/britain_wwtwo/german_pows_01.shtml|title= Life in Britain for German Prisoners of War|author=James Richards|date=2009-11-05|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2009-12-15|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946 a fifth of all agricultural work in the UK was performed by German prisoners.&lt;ref name="BBC POWs 1"/&gt;
An emotional and public debate ensued in the UK, where words such as "slaves", "slave labour" and "forced labour" were increasingly used in the media and in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="German migrants"&gt;{{cite book | author = Inge Weber-Newth |author2=Johannes-Dieter Steinert | title = German migrants in post-war Britain: an enemy embrace | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hSxK1Hus-BIC | accessdate = 2009-12-15 | year = 2006 | publisher = Routledge | isbn =978-0-7146-5657-1| pages = 24–30 | chapter = Chapter 2: Immigration policy—immigrant policy  | quote = Views in the Media were mirrored in the House of commons, where the arguments were characterised by a series of questions, the substance of which were always the same. Here too the talk was often of slave labour, and this debate was not laid to rest until the government announced its strategy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947 the Ministry of Agriculture argued against rapid repatriation of working German prisoners, since by then they made up 25 percent of the land workforce, and they wanted to use them also in 1948.&lt;ref name="German migrants"/&gt; Faced with political difficulties in using volunteer foreign labour a compromise solution was suggested by the ministry of agriculture, German prisoners were to be allowed to remain in Britain as free men.&lt;ref name="German migrants"/&gt; Following disputes about how many former prisoners of war would be permitted to remain voluntarily in Britain and whether they would first have to return briefly to Germany before being allowed to officially migrate to Britain,&lt;ref name="German migrants"/&gt; by the end of 1947 about  250,000 of the prisoners of war were repatriated, and the last repatriations took place in November 1948.&lt;ref name="BBC POWs 1"/&gt; About 24,000 chose to remain voluntarily in Britain.&lt;ref name="BBC POWs 1"/&gt;

===Norway===

In Norway the last available casualty record, from August 29, 1945, shows that by that time a total of 275 German soldiers had been killed while clearing mines, while an additional 392 had been maimed. German protests that forcing POWs to clear mines was against international law, article 32 of the Geneva conventions, were rejected with the assertion that the Germans were not POWs; they were disarmed forces who had surrendered unconditionally ("avvæpnede styrker som hadde overgitt seg betingelsesløst"). Mine clearance reports received by the Allied Forces Headquarters state: June 21, 1945; 199 dead and 163 wounded Germans; 3 Norwegians and 4 British wounded. The last registration, from August 29, 1945 lists 392 wounded and 275 dead Germans. Mine clearance was then for unknown reasons halted for close to a year before recommencing under better conditions during June–September 1946. This time many volunteered thanks to good pay, and death rates were much lower, possibly thanks in part to a deal permitting them medical treatment at Norwegian hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Tjersland, [http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=166207 Tyske soldater brukt som mineryddere] VG, 08-04-2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The United States transferred prisoners for forced labor to both the UK and France (which received 740,000 from the US).
For prisoners in the U.S. repatriation was also delayed for harvest reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky, Edward S. Herman, "After the Cataclysm: Postwar Indochina and the Reconstruction of Imperial Ideology" (1979) pp.&amp;nbsp;35–37 "In the United States, as in Britain, prisoners were used for forced labor. Truman delayed repatriation for 60 days for POWs essential for the harvest. POWs performed 20 million man-days of work on army posts and 10 million for contract employers (farm work, lumber, industry etc). some were assigned to work at the [[Chemical Warfare]] Center at the [[Edgewood Arsenal]] in Maryland."&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilians aged 14–65 in the U.S. occupation zone of Germany were also registered for compulsory labor, under threat of prison and withdrawal of ration cards.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Davidsson, "The Trial of the Germans: An Account of the Twenty-Two Defendants Before the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg", (1997) p.518 "In 1946 General Clay ordered the registration in the American zone of Germany of all persons capable of work between the age of 14 to 65 for men and 15 to 50 for women. 'All persons incapable of work because of illness, disability, etc., must present to the labor office proof of incapacity. the labor office is empowered to direct compulsory labor when necessary.' Under Allied Control Law No. 3 of February 17, 1946, German males from fourteen to sixty five and women from fifteen to fifty were subject to compulsory labor; the penalty for disobedience was imprisonment and having their ration cards taken away, a penalty that the [[International Military Tribunal]] declared inhuman when it was inflicted by the Germans."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conclusion===

Most captives of the Americans and the British were released by the end of 1948, and most of those in French captivity were released by the end of 1949.

According to the Office of Public Administration (part of [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Ministry of the Interior]]), compensation for Germans used as forced labor after the war cannot be claimed in Germany since September 29, 1978, due to the statute of limitations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/authoralbumbackground/2649/_rudi_war_total_durchloechert.html Zwangsarbeit als Minenräumer]"Rudi war total durchlöchert", [[SPIEGEL]] (accessed 2009-12-20)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5750">'''Francis Irénée du Pont''' (December 3, 1873 &amp;ndash; March 16, 1942) was an [[United States|American]] [[chemist]], and [[Management|manager]] at the [[DuPont|E.I. du Pont de Nemours Company]]. He was the great grandson of its founder, [[Eleuthère Irénée du Pont]].

==Biography==
Francis I. du Pont was the eldest son of [[Francis Gurney du Pont|Frances G. du Pont]] and Elise Wigfall Simons. He was born and grew up at [[Hagley Museum and Library|Hagley]], near [[Greenville, Delaware|Greenville]], [[Delaware]], attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and graduated from [[Yale University]]’s Sheffield Scientific School in 1895. He was placed at his father's [[Carney’s Point, New Jersey|Carney's Point]], [[New Jersey]] facility, where he joined in the research into the development of the new smokeless powder. This product was high sought after as the military was moving towards its use. He was known for his scientific expertise and managerial abilities, became superintendent of [[Carney’s Point, New Jersey|Carney's Point]], and was the first head of DuPont’s new Experimental Station research facility in 1904.

When the company was reorganized following its purchase by the three cousins, [[Alfred I. du Pont]], [[Pierre S. du Pont]], and [[T. Coleman du Pont]] in 1903, Francis I. du Pont was named to the Board of Directors and Executive Committee. With [[T. Coleman du Pont]] as President the company continued to grow, but within a few years [[Pierre S. du Pont]] became the acting president and effective leader of the company. In 1914, with the outbreak of [[World War I]] and the declining health of [[T. Coleman du Pont]], Pierre and Coleman sought a way to have the company buy Coleman's share of the company and redistribute it to some of the most highly valued non-family members in the company management. This effort, along with other more personal factors, touched off a full scale break between the cousins. Francis sided with [[Alfred I. du Pont]] in the contest, but by 1916 they had lost control and Francis lost his seat on the Board of Directors.

After leaving the company, he and his brother, Ernest du Pont, organized the U.S.F. Powder Company, which produced for the [[U.S. Navy]] a flashless powder for cannon. In 1922 he became Treasurer for the du Pont Motor Company and, with his son, [[Edmund du Pont]], founded a Wall Street brokerage in 1931.

In 1913, he published, through Saylor Show Print, Wilmington, DE, "Taxation: A Treatise written by F. I. DuPont" developing the ideas of [[Henry George]] (1839-1897), the Philadelphia-born author of "Progress and Poverty," which remains the best-selling book ever on political economy.   In his treatise, he examines various potential tax bases, and concludes that taxation of privilege, through taxation of land value, is the most desirable alternative. He calls land speculation "a gross misuse of the power of government" which ought to be abolished by taxation, in order to create prosperity. He ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Wilmington on that platform on the Progressive ticket.

Francis I. du Pont died on March 16, 1942.

'''Gordon Peter Getty''' (born December 20, 1933) is an American businessman, [[investing|investor]], [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] and [[classical music]] composer, the fourth child of oil tycoon [[J. Paul Getty]]. His mother, [[Ann Rork Light|Ann Rork]], was his father's fourth wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Peter | last=Byrne | title=Bringing Up Baby Gavin | date=April 2, 2003 | url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2003-04-02/news/bringing-up-baby-gavin | work=SF Weekly | accessdate=April 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When his father died in 1976, Gordon assumed control of [[Getty family|Getty's]] [[United States dollar|US$]]2&amp;nbsp;billion trust.  According to the [[Forbes 400]], as of September 2011 his net worth is $2 billion, making him number 212 on the list of the richest Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/gordon-getty/ |title=Gordon Getty – Forbes |accessdate=2011-10-18| publisher=Forbes Magazine |date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Getty was raised in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], attended [[St. Ignatius College Preparatory]], [[University of San Francisco]] and earned a B.A. in music from the [[San Francisco Conservatory of Music]]. He married Ann Gilbert in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], on Christmas Day, 1964.&lt;ref name=Forbes407 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-2nd-getty-family-an-open-secret-20150331-story.html|title=Gordon Getty's second family was an open secret|first=Los Angeles|last=Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the oil business to please his father; however, he eventually sold the family's [[Getty Oil]] to [[Texaco]] in 1986 for [[United States dollar|US$]]10&amp;nbsp;billion. In 1983, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine ranked him the richest person in America with a net worth a little over $2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6386/Walton-Sam.html|title=Walton, Sam – Overview, Personal Life, Career Details, Social and Economic Impact, Chronology: Sam Walton|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His current net worth is cited as $2&amp;nbsp;billion, making him the 212th richest person in the United States.

Getty is one of the nation's leading [[venture capital]]ists and [[philanthropy|philanthropists]]. In 2002, he donated US$3&amp;nbsp;million to the Ann and Gordon Getty Foundation, a charitable trust. He is a major fundraiser for local and national Democratic Party candidates, and has contributed to the campaigns of [[Nancy Pelosi]], [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]], [[Gavin Newsom]], and [[John Kerry]].

Among a number of professions, Getty is a [[European classical music|classical music]] composer whose compositions include the opera ''Plump Jack'', ''Joan and the Bells'', piano pieces and a collection of choral works. His one-act opera ''Usher House'' was performed by the San Francisco Opera in 2015.  Aspiring to become an [[opera]] singer, Getty studied in the mid-1970s with [[Louise Caselotti]], a mezzo-soprano who had been [[Maria Callas]]' voice teacher (1946–47). He and his wife have supported the fine arts, especially underwriting productions of the [[San Francisco Opera]] and the [[Russian National Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;''San Francisco Chronicle''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In 2002, Getty founded ReFlow, a company which temporarily purchases shares in [[mutual fund]]s to save funds taxes and commissions.&lt;ref name=Forbes407&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/10/07billionaires_Gordon-Getty_IX01.html |title= #407 Gordon Getty |accessdate=2008-11-20| work=Forbes |date=2007-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hibbard |first=Justin |title=How Gordon Getty Got To 'Aha!{{'-}} |journal=Business Week |date=2005-10-10 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_41/b3954109.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519031820/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_41/b3954109.htm |archivedate=2009-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2015, it was reported that Getty's son Andrew Rork Getty died at his home in [[Hollywood Hills]] of what was initially classified as natural causes, although coroner's officials needed to wait for the results of further examination and toxicology tests before making a final determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/natural-causes-accident-likely-getty-heir-death-074711547.html |title=Getty oil heir found dead wrote of serious health problem |work=[[Yahoo!

On May 9, 2015, was the premiere at [[Leipzig Opera]] of ''[[The Canterville Ghost]]'' opera by Gordon Getty.

The '''Hilton Garden Inn''' is a 120-foot 11 story [[high-rise]] hotel in the [[downtown Cleveland]] [[Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex|Gateway District]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emporis.com/buildings/157122/hilton-garden-inn-cleveland-gateway-cleveland-oh-usa ''Hilton Garden Inn Cleveland Gateway'' Retrieved on 2105-09-22&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[postmodern architecture|postmodern]] in style and has a color scheme of light red and beige. The Hilton is very squat in structure and occupies over a city block of space length wise, however, width wise it is very thin. It is connected to the Gateway Conference Center. The hotel features 240 rooms and sits directly across the street from [[Progressive Field]] which is the home of the [[Cleveland Indians]].&lt;ref&gt;http://hiltongardeninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/ohio/hilton-garden-inn-cleveland-downtown-CLEGWGI/index.html ''Hilton Garden Inn Cleveland Downtown'' Retrieved on 2015-09-22&lt;/ref&gt; It opened in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=21384 ''Hilton Garden Inn Cleveland Gateway'' Retrieved on 2015-09-22&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first major new hotels constructed in the central city area of downtown in the new millennium. It is one of five Hilton hotels in Cleveland, the other four being the [[Hilton Cleveland Downtown Hotel]] and the [[Double Tree Hotel Cleveland]], [[Hampton Inn (Cleveland)]] and [[Reserve Square]].

The hotel's location on Carnegie Avenue affords it a view of downtown and surrounding areas.  Its location adjacent to offramps to Interstates [[Interstate 71|71]], [[Interstate 77|77]], and [[Interstate 90|90]] makes it the city's only downtown hotel near a major highway.  This may change, if the [[NuCLEus]] project is completed by 2018.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3142">'''Hiram Barnes''' (19 October 1832 &amp;ndash; 24 April 1917) was a [[Queensland]] businessman, born in [[Beckley, Sussex]], noted for his association with [[Cobb and Co.]].

==History==
He came to Australia as a boy with his parents on the ''Duchess of Northumberland'', arriving in Sydney in 1837, attended Staff School, and lived some time in [[Kissing Point, New South Wales]], then in 1847 moved to [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. He joined the gold rush, first to [[Black Hill, Victoria|Black Hill]], then [[Forest Creek, Victoria|Forest Creek]] and [[Friars Creek, Victoria|Friars Creek]], the last of which made him a fortune, and he returned to live with his father in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]]. He started a business with three horse teams, carrying between St. Kilda, [[Castlemaine, Victoria|Castlemaine]] and [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]]. In 1858 he joined the rush to [[Rockhampton, Queensland]], but was unsuccessful and returned to the carrying business, with Hobby and Hewstead, competitor to Cobb and Co., who shortly took them over. He drove for Cobb and Co., becoming manager of the [[Forbes, New South Wales|Forbes]] to [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] route, at the time bushranger [[Ben Hall (bushranger)|Ben Hall]] was active in that region. In 1865 he moved to [[Queensland]], where with partners James Rutherford and John Robertson, he took over the business of John Nolan, who had the mail contract between Brisbane and [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]]. As an independent branch of Cobb and Co., they took over the businesses of Cook and Fraser, then Mrs. Hartley of [[Jondaryan, Queensland|Jondaryan]], so expanding his business out of [[Toowoomba]]. [[Roma, Queensland|Roma]] and [[Gympie]] followed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22288975 |title=An Early Pioneer |newspaper=[[The Queenslander]] |location=Brisbane |date=7 January 1911 |accessdate=11 May 2014 |page=16 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later he was employed by his sons' firm of Barnes and Co., [[Brisbane]], and lived at [[Kelvin Grove, Queensland|Kelvin Grove]].

He was a [[teetotal]] member of the Methodist Church, and worshipped at the Albert Street Church, and later at the Kelvin Grove Church, where he held responsible official positions. He died at the home of his son-in-law, Rev. Robert Kerr, of [[Toowong, Queensland|Toowong]].

==Family==
His wife predeceased him by a few months. Their children included politicians [[George Powell Barnes|G. P. Barnes]], M.L.A. and [[Walter Barnes (politician)|W. H. Barnes]] (formerly State Treasurer), Fred Barnes, Mrs. John Reid, Mrs. Samuel Knowles, Mrs. B. A. Taudevin (of Melbourne), Mrs. Wagner, Mrs. Robert Kerr, Mrs. T. U.

'''IMUnited''' was a coalition of [[instant messaging]] service providers, including [[Yahoo!]] and [[Microsoft]], that wanted [[AOL]] to open its proprietary [[AIM network]] to them. It appears to have disappeared, possibly because both Yahoo!'s and Microsoft's instant messaging services started to gain popularity.

'''John D. Chandris''' (1890 – 1942) was a [[Greece|Greek]] shipowner.

Chandris was born in [[Chios]], then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1915, after years of experience in the shipping industry, he bought his first ship, the S/S ''Dimitrios''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6 Cruise Industry Pioneers|url=http://www.travelpulse.com/news/features/6-cruise-industry-pioneers.html|website=Travel Pulse|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By [[World War I]], Chandris' fleet was made up of four ships, including [[steamship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6 Cruise Industry Pioneers|url=http://www.travelpulse.com/news/features/6-cruise-industry-pioneers.html|website=Travel Pulse|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, he expanded into the passenger shipping market.

Following the outbreak of [[World War II]], Chandris followed the exodus of shipowners from Greece. He moved to England. Chandris ran the cruise lines until he retired in 1939. He died in 1942  at the age 52 from natural causes.

His two sons, [[Anthony J. Chandris|Anthony]] and [[Dimitri Chandris|Dimitri]], later rebuilt the company, named [[Chandris Line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greek Shipping Hall of Fame: ANTHONY J. CHANDRIS (1924-1984)|url=http://greekshippinghalloffame.org/chandris.html|website=greekshippinghalloffame.org|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partnership called Chandris-Fantasy Cruises started in the early 1980s and later was divided into two separate arms, Fantasy-Cruises and Celebrity cruises.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3504">'''Mary Jane Innes''' (née '''Lewis''', 18 April 1852 &amp;ndash; 14 November 1941) was a Welsh-born New Zealand brewery manager.

==Early life==
Mary Jane Lewis was born on a farm in [[Llanvaches]], [[Monmouthshire]], Wales on 18 April 1852. Her parents were Thomas Lewis and Hannah Morgan Lewis.&lt;ref name="DNZB Innes"&gt;{{DNZB|last=Innes|first=Colin V.|id=2i1|title=Mary Jane Innes|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She immigrated to New Zealand with her older brother and sister in 1870, after their parents died.&lt;ref name="Waikato"&gt;Crystal Ardern, [http://waikatomuseum.co.nz/explore/our-stories/immigrants-and-settlers/mary-jane-innes-a-lady-in-the-brewing-business/ "Mary Jane Innes: A Lady in the Brewing Business"] ''Waikato Times'' (2 September 2006): D7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Mary Jane Innes owned and operated Te Awamutu Brewery from 1877 (with her husband), and Waikato Breweries from 1889. In widowhood she launched the successful C. L. Innes and Company, in partnership with her eldest son Charles Lewis Innes.&lt;ref name="Waikato" /&gt; She turned the company over to two of her sons in 1912. The Innes brewing and bottling businesses not only produced alcoholic beverages, but "aerated waters," thus making a start to the soft-drink industry in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/hamilton-news/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503366&amp;objectid=11107037 "Soft Drink Empire Founder Inducted"] ''Hamilton News'' (10 August 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandson [[Harold Hirst Innes]] was senior director of Innes Industries in 1961, when they merged with another company to create Oasis Group.&lt;ref&gt;Julie P. L. Shaw, [http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/5i4/innes-harold-hirst "Harold Hirst Innes"] ''Dictionary of New Zealand Biography'' 5(2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and legacy==
Mary Jane Lewis married Scotsman Charles Innes in [[Auckland]] in 1874. They had ten children together.  She was widowed in 1899. Mary Jane Innes died in Auckland in 1941, age 89. Her remains were buried in Hamilton East Cemetery.&lt;ref name="DNZB Innes"/&gt;

In 2013, she was inducted into the New Zealand Business Hall of Fame, 72 years after her death.&lt;ref name="Female entrepreneur"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slade|first1=Maria|title=Female entrepreneur in a man's world|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/better-business/8730246/Female-entrepreneur-in-a-mans-world|accessdate=29 December 2014|work=[[The Press]]|date=29 May 2013|page=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Business Hall of Fame, Past Laureates, [http://www.businesshalloffame.co.nz/past-laureates/innes-mary/ Mary Innes].&lt;/ref&gt;

Objects and papers belonging to Innes and her family are part of the collection in the [[Waikato Museum]].&lt;ref name="Waikato" /&gt; Mary Jane's grandson Colin V. Innes co-wrote a book about the family's early history in brewing, ''A Crown for the Lady: The Unravelling of a Pioneer Story'' (Tauranga: Moana Press, 1989).&lt;ref&gt;Colin V. Innes and Kieran P.

'''Media strategy''', as used in the [[advertising]] or [[content delivery]] (online broadcasting) industries, is concerned with how messages will be delivered to [[consumer]]s or [[niche markets]]. It involves: identifying the characteristics of the target audience or market, who should receive messages and defining the characteristics of the [[Mass media|media]] that will be used for the delivery of the messages, with the intent being to influence the behaviour of the [[target audience]] or market pertinent to the initial brief. Examples of such strategies today have revolved around an [[Integrated Marketing Communications]] approach whereby multiple channels of media are used i.e. [[advertising]], [[public relations]], events, [[direct response media]], etc.

This concept has been used among proponents of [[entertainment]]-education programming where pro-social messages are embedded into dramatic episodic programs to change the audiences attitudes and behaviors in such areas as [[family planning]], [[literacy]], [[nutrition]], [[Tobacco advertising#Anti-smoking advertising|smoking]], etc.

'''Michael Cherney''' ({{lang-he-n|מיכאל צ'רנוי}}, {{lang-ru|Михаил Чёрный}}, also '''Mikhail Chernoy''', '''Mikhail Chorny''' or '''Mikhail Chernoi'''; born 16 January 1952) is a Uzbekistan-born [[Israel]]i entrepreneur and industrialist. He is known for his significant role in the 1990s Aluminium in Russia, and his business ventures in Israel. He is also the founder of the [[Michael Cherney Foundation]] and a sponsor of [[The Intelligence Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/jacobs010206.html "Kenneth Timmerman's Iranian 'Democracy' and the 'Intelligence' Summit"], Ron Jacobs, February 1, 2006 (Monthly Review Zine website)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "SPT-2007"&gt;{{cite news |author=Meg Laughlin |title=Intelligence conference draws criticism |newspaper=[[The St. Petersburg Times]] |date=6 March 2007 |page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Cherney grew up in [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbek SSR]], in a family whose father was a book-keeper and an engineer, the eldest of three sons. At the age of fourteen, Cherney started working, as he joined his father on moonlighting jobs. After [[high school]], he was drafted into the [[Soviet Army]] and attended a technical college. Later, his athletic pursuits – boxing and football – led to employment in sports administration.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In the early 1990s Cherney immigrated to [[Israel]] but kept close ties to Bulgaria, where he had bought a leading newspaper, a top [[association football| football]] team and Bulgaria's only mobile phone company, [[Mobiltel]]. In August 2000 Bulgarian authorities denounced what they said were his ties to foreign criminal rackets and expelled him, saying he could not return to Bulgaria for 10 years.&lt;ref name="NYT-Intrigue"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/03/business/intrigue-derails-a-public-offering-israel-halts-sale-of-phone-company.html |title=Intrigue Derails A Public Offering; Israel Halts Sale of Phone Company |author=William A. Orme Jr. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 April 2001 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the United States has "denied Cherney a visa since 1999 because of alleged ties to the Russian mafia, according to ''[[The St. Petersburg Times]]''".&lt;ref name= "SPT-2007"/&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2014|reason=Impossible citation; the PDF of this paper  http://www.sptimes.ru/archive/pdf/1251.pdf  doesn't have this story!}}

Cherney is wanted on an [[Interpol]] international arrest warrant on allegations of [[money laundering]] and organised crime, but in June 2010 ''The Jerusalem Post'' reported that Cherney is preparing an application to contest it before the European Union Court of Human Rights.&lt;ref name="Interpol"&gt;[http://www.interpol.int/public/Data/Wanted/Notices/Data/2009/42/2009_21842.asp Wanted: CHERNEY, Michael] ''[[Interpol]]''{{dead link|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jpost.com"&gt;{{cite news |author=Jonny Paul |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/British-High-Court-to-decide-Can-Cherney-testify-by-video |title=British High Court to decide: Can Cherney testify by video? |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=23 June 2011 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010 the Israeli TV Channel Two aired a short program about the most expensive and lavish wedding ceremony in Israel until that time, costing 20 million ILS  (about 5 million US dollars). The program revealed that the bride was Cherny's daughter, that the wedding was paid by him and that Israeli ministers and members of parliament (Knesset) of Russian origin attended.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPFj6E-0NKk The most expensive wedding in Israel] (Hebrew, TV Channel 2 Israel account on YouTube)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business interests==

===TWG and founding of the Russian aluminium industry===
Cherney, together with his brother [[Lev Cherney]] and UK metals traders [[David and Simon Reuben]], founded [[Trans-World Group]] (TWG) – the first and largest private company in Russia, which produced [[aluminium]] and sold it on Western markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jun/03/russia | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=First oligarch claims his due | date=3 June 2007 | accessdate=12 October 2014 | first=Simon | last=Bell}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''BusinessWeek'' reports that the brothers "were known for their rough style of doing business".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Grabbing a corner on Russian aluminum |author=Julia Flynn |author2=Patricia Kranz |work=[[BusinessWeek]] |date=15 September 1996 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/1996-09-15/grabbing-a-corner-on-russian-aluminum-intl-edition |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, TWG was drawn into a government inquiry into the theft of more than $US100 million from Russia's central bank by a number of separate criminal groups during the early 1990s. In an article on TWG, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine reported: "That a theft occurred is not in dispute, nor is the fact that the Cherneys ended up with a piece of the stolen money and used it to partially fund Trans World's startup phase in 1992.... The inquiry's objective was to determine whether the Cherneys knew the funds were indeed stolen."&lt;ref name="Fortune200006-12"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/06/12/281972/index.htm |title=Capitalism In A Cold Climate |author=Richard Behar |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=12 June 2000 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to clean up its reputation and refute allegations of questionable business practices, the [[Reuben brothers]] hired [[Mayer Brown|Mayer Brown &amp; Platt]], a US-based law firm. Terrence Burke, an investigator employed by the law firm and former acting head of the DEA, recommended that the Reubens sever their ties with Cherney after the [[FBI]] told him that "it believed Michael himself was an organised crime figure." As a result, Michael was paid $US400 million "just to go away" while his brother Lev remained with the company.&lt;ref name="Fortune200006-12" /&gt;

In August 2001 a ''Fortune'' article notes, "the prosecutor's office in [[Düsseldorf]] notified the [[Reuben brothers]] that it had terminated its probe into alleged money laundering, saying 'I hereby confirm expressly that there is no remaining suspicion of money laundering or any other criminal actions.'" However, the same article states that the Kroll report "doesn't discuss an essential part of the story", nor does it "explore the complex business and financial relationships in Russia between the Reubens and Lev and Michael Chernoy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/06/12/281972/index.htm#update |title=David and Simon Reuben: Update and Clarification |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=12 July 2004 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SuAl and partnership with Oleg Deripaska===
According to the Financial Times, in 1994, [[Oleg Deripaska]], then an independent metals trader, won the backing of Cherney and TWG to become general manager of Sayansk aluminium plant in Siberia, which lead to formation of SibAl and a partnership between Cherney and Oleg Deripaska in this company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |author=Catherine Belton |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/70a1c458-09ff-11df-8b23-00144feabdc0.html |title=Rusal: A lingering heat |newspaper=[[Financial Times]]}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Catherine Belton |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/36fa2390-7e35-11de-8f8d-00144feabdc0.html |title=Russian tycoon loses legal fight over Rusal |newspaper=[[Financial Times]]}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BulgarTabac===
In 2002, 80% of the capital in the Bulgarian State-owned tobacco company, [[Bulgartabac]], was placed on the market. In April 2002 Cherney put together a three-partner consortium called "Metatabac" to bid for Bulgartabac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ivan Vatahov |url=http://sofiaecho.com/2002/08/22/635474_metatabac-still-in-the-game |title=Metatabac still in the game |newspaper=[[Sofia Echo]] |date=22 August 2002 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ownership was structured between three groups: the Russian firm Soyuzcontracttabac, which owned 35%, MCG Holdings, a firm owned by Cherney, which owned 35%, and another 30% held by a [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] company named Metacontact Ltd.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Mobiltel===
In 2002 Cherney was involved in the selling-on of the [[Bulgaria]]n mobile provider [[Mobiltel]]. Cherney bought the company together with Austrian business men [[Martin Schlaff]], former minister of the [[Austrian People's Party]] [[Josef Taus]], and financial expert [[Herbert Cordt]]. The 768 million Euro deal was financed by [[BAWAG P.S.K.]]. In 2005 Mobiltel was sold for 1.6 billion euros to [[Mobilkom Austria|Mobilkom Austria Group]] with a huge profit of 830 million Euros.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100621011505/http://www.salzburg.com/sn/06/09/22/artikel/2447799.html Schlaff, Elsner, Birdie und Telekom]&lt;/ref&gt; Critics found it hard to understand "why the state bought an asset for such a high price from someone who was effectively a go-between who stood to pocket a fat profit, rather than directly from the original owner of the company".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gidi Weitz |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/special-report-the-schlaff-saga/the-schlaff-saga-a-witness-but-not-a-suspect-1.312802 |title=The Schlaff Saga / A witness, but not a suspect |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=7 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917225323/http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/special-report-the-schlaff-saga/the-schlaff-saga-a-witness-but-not-a-suspect-1.312802 |archivedate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Intelligence Summit==
Cherney is the founder and primary sponsor of the Intelligence Summit.&lt;ref name= "SPT-2007"/&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2014|reason=Impossible citation; the PDF of this paper  http://www.sptimes.ru/archive/pdf/1251.pdf  doesn't have this story!}} In February 2006, ''The New York Sun'' reported that [[John Deutch]] and [[James Woolsey]] had resigned from the [[Intelligence Summit]]'s board of advisers after receiving information that the conference's primary sponsor, Cherney, had "alleged ties to the Russian mafia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nysun.com/foreign/furor-erupts-over-recordings-of-saddam/27684/ |title=Furor Erupts Over Recordings of Saddam |author=Eli Lake |newspaper=The New York Sun |date=16 February 2006 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2007/05/03/Outside-View-Fearing-oligarchs-Part-2/UPI-92881178214623/ |title=Outside View: Fearing oligarchs -- Part 2 |author=Sergei Markov |publisher=UPI |date=3 May 2007 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal investigations==

===Invalid passport===
On 21 May 1994, Cherney and his future wife were detained by immigration officers on arrival in [[Heathrow]] from [[Geneva]]. It was discovered that they had attempted to enter the UK on false [[Poland|Polish]] passports and they were deported back to [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="BAILII_1530"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2008/1530.html |title=Cherney v Deripaska, 2008 EWHC 1530 (Comm), |publisher=[[Free_Access_to_Law_Movement#BAILII|BAILII]] |date=3 July 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day they were arrested by the Swiss police on the grounds that they had made use of false identities. Both were searched and found to be in possession of two allegedly invalid Polish driving licences. Cherney gave a statement to the police in which he admitted using a Polish passport in an attempt to enter the UK, which had been successful previously.&lt;ref name="BAILII_1530" /&gt; On 25 October 1994 the Swiss authorities confirmed that they would not be pressing any charges against Cherney. On 20 November 1996 the Swiss Federal Aliens Office confirmed that he was no longer subject to a prohibition order and that there was nothing to prevent his coming into Switzerland.&lt;ref name="BAILII_1530" /&gt;

===Alleged illegal payments to Avigdor Lieberman===
Cherney is a close friend of [[Avigdor Lieberman]] who allegedly received millions of shekels from various entrepreneurs, including Cherney, while serving as member of [[Knesset]]; under Israeli law, MKs are not allowed to receive any payment beyond their salary. One claim is that Cherney paid a company called ''Path to the East'' large amounts of money between the years 1999 and 2006, and that these sums were then allegedly passed on to Lieberman as a bribe. Other allegations concern a company called ''M.L.1'', founded by Lieberman's daughter Michal when she was 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/who-s-the-boss-1.217557 |title=Who's the boss? |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |author=[[Uri Blau]] |date=7 April 2007 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These allegations concern money transferred to M.L.1 from unknown sources outside Israel; the money was later allegedly used for paying salaries to Avigdor and Michal Lieberman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Uri Blau]] |author2=[[Alex Levac]] |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.1249131 |script-title=he:הקופה הקטנה והתסריט שכתב יו"ר ישראל ביתנו אביגדור ליברמן |language=he |trans-title=The Small Fund and the Screenplay Written by Israel Beitenu Leader Avigdor Lieberman |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, Israeli police questioned [[Avigdor Lieberman]], Israel's Deputy Prime Minister, on suspicions of illegally financing his 2001 electoral campaign. According to the police, in May 2001, three months after Lieberman was appointed Minister of Infrastructure in [[Ariel Sharon]]'s Cabinet, approximately $US500,000 was transferred to the bank accounts of Lieberman associates through [[Cyprus]]. This money could be traced back to Cherney. Cherney's attorney, Yaakov Weinroth, said the money was transferred by his client "for a totally transparent, legal wine deal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/500-000-funneled-to-lieberman-associates-1.218910 |title=$500,000 funneled to Lieberman associates |author=Gidi Weitz |author2=[[Uri Blau]] |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=25 April 2007 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, [[Haaretz]] reported that the Israeli Attorney General had issued a draft indictment against [[Avigdor Lieberman]] for fraud and money laundering, including allegations against Cherny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Tomer Zarchin |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/ag-plans-to-charge-lieberman-with-fraud-and-money-laundering-1.355836 |title=AG plans to charge Lieberman with fraud and money laundering |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=14 April 2011 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second ''[[Haaretz]]'' article detailing the draft indictment reported that a company owned by Cherney had paid $US500,000 to a company owned by [[Avigdor Lieberman]] in May 2001.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;{{cite news |author=Gidi Weitz |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/draft-charges-lieberman-made-millions-in-illegal-business-deals-1.365032 |title=Draft charges: Lieberman made millions in illegal business deals |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=31 May 2011 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It added, "Prosecutors say Lieberman then used his government posts to try to restore Chernoy's Israeli passport, which he had been stripped of in 1999, and to assist him in other personal matters."&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt; Cherney was acquitted. Over the years, Cherney's passport was returned by the Israeli authorities.&lt;ref name="globes2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000654092 |title=After a Long Legal Battle: Mikhail Cherney Received an Israeli Passport |work=Globes |author=Yoaz, Yuval |date=June 14, 2011 |accessdate=May 16, 2016 |language=Hebrew |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605025503/http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000654092 |archivedate=5 June 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bezeq affair===
In 1999, businessman [[Gad Zeevi]] purchased shares in the Israeli telecommunications company [[Bezeq]] on behalf of businesses he owned. According to an indictment filed in 2004, Cherney provided the financial guarantee for the purchase—information that Cherney and Zeevi hid from the banks financing the deal, in fear that Cherney's direct involvement would not be approved by the Israeli ministry of communications. In 2015, Cherney, Zeevi and a number of other defendants were cleared of all charges, with the court stating that the information had not in fact been hidden, and the fact that Cherney loaned the necessary funds to Zeevi did not constitute fraud against Bezeq.&lt;ref name="globes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001075168 |title=Bezeq Affair: Full Acquital for Zeevi, Cherney, Ze'ev Rom and Michael Komissar |work=Globes |author=Ma'anit, Hen |date=October 21, 2015 |accessdate=May 16, 2016 |language=Hebrew |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605012224/http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001075168 |archivedate=5 June 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish allegations and attempted arrest in the United Kingdom===
According to sources cited in the Spanish daily ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'', Spanish authorities sought Cherney in connection to "[[Operation Avispa]]", a 2005 investigation that had resulted in the arrest of several prominent Russian mafia figures. The investigators believe that Cherney managed several Spanish businesses, registered in Alicante and Levante, used by the mafia for money laundering of 4 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?story_id=30622&amp;action_id=2 |title=Cherney Faces Travel Problems |newspaper=[[The St. Petersburg Times]] |agency=[[Vedomosti]] |date=19 January 2010 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/07/05/espana/1246812131.html |title=Reino Unido elude detener a un mafioso ruso reclamado por España |language=es |trans-title=UK elude arresting a Russian mobster claimed by Spain |author=Fernando Lázaro |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |date=6 July 2009 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, [[Supreme Court of Spain|Spain's Supreme Court]] issued a detention order against Cherney. Along with his business partners Oleg Deripaska (head of [[RusAl]]) and [[Iskander Makhmudov]] (head of [[UGMK-HOLDING|UGMK]]), Cherney is suspected of laundering money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elmundo.es/papel/2010/03/21/mercados/23228430.html |title=El pulso de los oligarcas rusos en la Audiencia Nacional |language=es |trans-title=The pulse of Russian oligarchs in the High Court |author=Carlos Segovia |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |date=21 March 2010 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish authorities claim they succeeded in tracing the organization's complicated money laundering track, including Deripaska's, Makhmudov's and Cherney's alleged participation. As a result, [[Interpol]] issued an international arrest warrant against Cherney.&lt;ref name="Interpol"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Olga Viniar |agency=[[Calcalist]] |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3835491,00.html |title=Michael Cherney wanted by Interpol |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=18 January 2010 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/08/09MADRID869.html |title=Viewing cable 09MADRID869, Updates in Spain's Investigations of Russian Mafia |publisher=[[WikiLeaks]] |date=31 August 2009 |accessdate=12 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017104556/http://wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/08/09MADRID869.html |archivedate=17 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }} U.S. diplomatic cable from U.S. Embassy in Madrid released 7 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit against Oleg Deripaska==
On 24 November 2006, Cherney filed a suit against [[Oleg Deripaska]], a Russian billionaire who owns the huge Russian aluminium company, [[RusAl]], in the Commercial Court of London's High Court. Cherney sought a Court declaration affirming that Deripaska holds 20% of the RusAl shares on behalf of Cherney or damages for breach of Deripaska's agreement to dispose of the shares and to account to Cherney for the proceeds. The claims are based on a written agreement between the two businessmen that was signed in a London hotel room in March 2001. Deripaska denies that Cherney owns shares and said in an affidavit that his relationship with Cherney was one of a businessman being extorted by a crime boss. After the 2001 meeting, Deripaska paid Cherney $US250 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Andrew E. Kramer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/23/business/global/23rusal.html |title=Russian Oligarch's Long Road to a Hong Kong I.P.O. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=22 January 2010 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2006 RusAl was in the final stages of negotiating a takeover of domestic rival SuAl and the aluminium assets of [[Glencore]], a major Swiss commodities trader, which could create a new company valued at up to $US30 billion. According to this estimate, Cherney's 20 percent stake in RusAl could be worth as much as $US3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15980235 MSNBC report on lawsuit against Deripaska] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 July 2008, a British judge ruled that Cherney had the right to sue Deripaska for £2 billion. High Court Justice Christopher Clarke ruled that Cherney might be assassinated or held on trumped-up charges if he tried to bring the case in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Peter Graff |date=3 July 2008 |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUKL0355457020080703 |title=High Court allows Cherney lawsuit against Deripaska to proceed in the UK |publisher=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a June 2011 case management conference, the judge deferred a decision on whether Cherney would be allowed to give evidence by video link from Israel rather than appear in person as an outstanding Interpol arrest warrant means he would be detained if he visited the UK.&lt;ref name="Interpol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jpost.com"/&gt; In late July 2011, the High Court ruled that Cherney may give evidence at the trial by video link from Israel and set trial for April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23973334-the-gangster-a-billionaire-friend-of-mandelson-and-a-pound-23bn-row.do |title=The 'gangster', a billionaire friend of Mandelson and a £2.3bn row |work=[[London Evening Standard]] |first=Paul |last=Cheston |date=28 July 2011 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222031121/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23973334-the-gangster-a-billionaire-friend-of-mandelson-and-a-pound-23bn-row.do |archivedate=22 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The case was settled out of court between Cherney and Deripaska in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/27/deripaska-cherney-surprise-deal | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Luke | last=Harding | title=Deripaska and Cherney make surprise deal out of court | date=27 September 2012 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illegal wiretaps===
On 13 January 2010, a [[Tel Aviv]] Court handed down its first verdict in the case of [[Surveillance#Telephones_and_mobile_telephones|illegal eavesdropping]] on Cherney. Aviv Mor, a [[private investigator]] was found guilty of illegally gathering information of personal nature - in particular, tapping the phones of Cherney and sentenced to a [[plea bargain]]ed result which handed down a 14-month sentence to Mor. Part of the sentence will be in the form of [[community service]] and the rest will be a [[suspended sentence]]. The [[District attorney]]'s office stated in court that the cases of other suspects in the illegal data collection case "are at an advanced stage and close to [[indictment]] ." In February 2008 Cheney  filed a suit in a Tel Aviv court that alleged the illegal spying was commissioned by a Russian citizen, Alexei Drobashenko who at the time was the head of the External Relations department at Basic Element, a financial and industrial group that belongs to [[Oleg Deripaska]]. Cherney claimed that it was this [[Russian oligarch]], acting through Drobashenko, who had hired Eskin, Pridan and Mor. In his claim, Cherney accused a group of 10 plotters, including Oleg Deripaska, Alexei Drobashenko and the already sentenced Aviv Mor, of illegal wiretapping, hacking the computers of his charity fund, publishing slanderous articles, and harassing him with insulting graffities and leaflets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ca.sys-con.com/node/1256803 |title=Detective Hired by Deripaska's Employee to Wiretap Cherney Sentenced in Tel-Aviv |publisher=Ajaz world magazine |agency=PR Newswire |date=22 January 2010 |accessdate=11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Spouse of Michael Cherney is a businesswoman [[Nicole Raidman]]. In 2010 their first daughter was born [[Michelle Raidman]]. and in 2014 their son Richie. Cherney and Raidman live in Herzliya Israel.

'''Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.''' ('''OSG - Overseas Shipping Group''') ({{NYSE|OSG}}) is the operator of a fleet of twenty-four [[Tanker (ship)|oil tanker]]s. It is based in [[Tampa, Florida]], United States, and was founded in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=294306|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporate Profile: Fast Facts|url=http://www.osg.com/index.cfm?pageid=3|publisher=OSG|accessdate=29 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409040506/http://www.osg.com/index.cfm?pageid=3|archivedate=9 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, under the leadership of [[Raphael Recanati]], OSG began acquiring [[Tanker (ship)|tanker ships]] to transport oil from Alaska to the [[Contiguous United States|lower 48]] US states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qf2QiRYXcdUC&amp;pg|title=The Way of the Ship: America's Maritime History Reenvisoned, 1600-2000|last=Roland|first=Alex|last2=Bolster|first2=W.

In the 1990s, OSG began to acquire luxury cruise liners. In 1995, the cruise ships resulted in losses of over $12 million to OSG. As a result of the losses, [[Michael Recanati]], the son of Raphael Recanati, was reported to have been forced to leave OSG.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-350660|title="Bloomberg":  Rafael Recanati Dismissed Son from Family Shipping Co Management - Globes English|website=Globes|language=he|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Power of attorney.jpg|thumb|Power of attorney]]
A '''power of attorney''' ('''POA''') or '''letter of attorney''' is a written authorization to represent or act on another's behalf in private affairs, business, or some other legal matter. The person authorizing the other to act is the ''principal'', ''grantor'', or ''donor'' (of the power). The one authorized to act is the ''[[agency (law)|agent]]''&lt;ref&gt;Under Louisiana state law only, the agent is referred to as a "mandatary".  See [http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=110025 Louisiana Civil Code Art. 2989]&lt;/ref&gt; or, in some [[common law]] jurisdictions, the '''attorney-in-fact'''.

Formerly, the term "power" referred to an [[legal instrument|instrument]] signed under [[Seal (contract law)|seal]] while a "letter" was an instrument under hand, meaning that it was simply signed by the parties, but today a power of attorney need not be signed under seal. Some jurisdictions require that powers of attorney be notarized or witnessed, but others will enforce a power of attorney as long as it is signed by the grantor.

==Attorney-in-fact==
The term ''attorney-in-fact'' is used in many jurisdictions instead of the term ''agent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attorney-in-Fact|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/attorney-in-fact|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That term should be distinguished from the term ''[[attorney at law (United States)|attorney-at-law]]''. In the United States, an attorney-at-law is a [[solicitor]] who is also licensed to be an advocate in a particular jurisdiction. An attorney-in-fact may be a layperson and is authorized to act pursuant to the powers granted by a power of attorney, but may not engage in acts that would constitute the unauthorized practice of law.

In the context of the unincorporated [[reciprocal inter-insurance exchange]] (URIE) the attorney-in-fact is a stakeholder/trustee who takes custody of the subscriber funds placed on deposit with him, and then uses those funds to pay insurance claims. When all the claims are paid, the attorney-in-fact then returns the leftover funds to the subscribers.

The Uniform Power of Attorney Act employs the term ''agent''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/dpoaa/2008_final.htm Uniform Power of Attorney Act, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129080542/http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/dpoaa/2008_final.htm |date=2011-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an agent, an attorney-in-fact is a [[fiduciary]] for the principal, so the law requires an attorney-in-fact to be completely honest with and loyal to the [[Principal (commercial law)|principal]] in their dealings with each other.

Care must be taken when selecting an attorney-in-fact, as some attorneys-in-fact have used their authority to steal the assets of vulnerable individuals such as the elderly (see [[elder abuse]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Michele|title=Remedying Financial Abuse by Agents Under a Power of Attorney for Finances|journal=Marquette Elder’s Advisor|volume=2|issue=4|pages=39-48|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1264&amp;context=elders|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and requirements==

===Capacity of the grantor===
{{Main article|Capacity (law)}}
The person who creates a power of attorney, known as the grantor, can only do so when he/she has the requisite mental capacity. Suppose the grantor loses capacity to grant permission after the power of attorney has been created (for example, from [[Alzheimer's disease]] or a head injury in a car crash); then the power will probably no longer be effective.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}  In some powers of attorney the grantor states that he/she wishes the document to remain in effect even after he/she becomes incapacitated. This type of power is commonly referred to as a [[#Durable power of attorney|durable power of attorney]]. If someone is already incapacitated, it is not possible for that person to execute a valid power. If a person does not have the capacity to execute a power of attorney (and does not already have a durable power in place), often the only way for another party to act on their behalf is to have a court impose a [[conservatorship]] or a [[guardianship]].

===Oral and written===
Depending on the jurisdiction, a power of attorney may be oral and, whether witnessed, will hold up in court, the same as if it were in writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power of Attorney|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/power_of_attorney|publisher=Cornell Legal Information Institute|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some purposes, the law requires a power of attorney to be in writing. Many institutions, such as [[hospital]]s, [[bank]]s and, in the United States, the [[Internal Revenue Service]], require a power of attorney to be in writing before they will honor it, and they will usually keep a duplicate original or a copy for their records. Nursing homes often follow the same practice.

===Equal dignity rule===
The '''equal dignity rule''' is a principle of law that requires an authorization for someone performing certain acts for another person to have been appointed with the same formality as required for the act the representative is going to perform. This means, for example, that if a principal authorizes someone to sell the principal's house or other real property, and the law requires a contract for the sale of real property to be in writing (which is required under the [[Statute of frauds|Statute of Frauds]] in most U.S. jurisdictions), then the authorization for the other person to sign the sales contract and deed must be in writing too. Likewise, in common-law jurisdictions other than the U.S., a power of an attorney to execute a [[deed]] (i.e. instrument under seal or executed in presence of two witnesses) must be itself executed as a deed.

===Execution===
In order for a power of attorney to become a legally enforceable document, at a minimum it must be signed and dated by the principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irving|first1=Shae|title=Durable Financial Power of Attorney: How It Works|website=Nolo|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions also require that a power of attorney be witnessed, notarized, or both.&lt;ref name=expertlaw1/&gt; Even when not required, having the document reviewed and signed (and often stamped) by a [[notary public]] may increase the likelihood of withstanding a legal challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preventing Challenges to Your Power of Attorney|url=http://www.agis.com/Document/470/preventing-challenges-to-your-financial-power-of-attorney.aspx|publisher=AssistGuide Information Services|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the attorney-in-fact is being paid to act on behalf of the principal, a [[contract]] for payment may be separate from the document granting power of attorney. If that separate contract is in writing, as a separate document it may be kept private between the principal and agent even when the power of attorney is presented to others for the purposes of carrying out the agent's duties.

==Types== &lt;!-- The article [[Right to die]] links to this heading --&gt;
A power of attorney may be: ''special'' (also called ''limited''), ''general'', or ''temporary''. A special power of attorney is one that is limited to a specified act or type of act. A general power of attorney is one that allows the agent to make all personal and business decisions&lt;ref name=ppl&gt;{{cite web|title=Powers of Attorney|url=http://www.peoples-law.org/node/739|publisher=People's Law Library|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Power of Attorney vs. Special Power of Attorney|url=https://www.rocketlawyer.com/article/general-and-special-power-of-attorney-documents--important-differences.rl|publisher=RocketLawyer|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A temporary power of attorney is one with a limited time frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Temporary Power of Attorney|url=http://oregonlawhelp.org/resource/temporary-power-of-attorney?ref=97xzj|publisher=oregonlawhelp.org|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ever required, a durable power of attorney can be revoked or changed as long as the principal is still mentally competent to act.

===Durable===
Under the common law, a power of attorney becomes ineffective if its grantor dies or becomes "incapacitated," meaning unable to grant such a power, because of physical injury or [[mental illness]], for example, unless the grantor (or principal) specifies that the power of attorney will continue to be effective even if the grantor becomes incapacitated. This type of power of attorney is called "power of attorney with durable provisions" in the United States or "[[enduring power of attorney]]" elsewhere. In effect, under a durable power of attorney (DPA), the authority of the attorney-in-fact to act and/or make decisions on behalf of the grantor continues until the grantor's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Elias|title=Gratuitous Transfers: Wills, Intestate Succession, Trusts, Gifts, Future Interests, and Estate and Gift Taxation|year=2007|publisher=Thomson/West|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=978-0-314-16040-9|pages=310|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
In some jurisdictions, a durable power of attorney can also be a "health care power of attorney."  This particular affidavit gives the attorney-in-fact the authority to make health-care decisions for the grantor, up to and including terminating care and life support. The grantor can typically modify or restrict the powers of the agent to make end-of-life decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ksbar.org/public/public_resources/pamphlets/living_wills.shtml |publisher=Kansas Bar Association |title=Living Wills And The Durable Power Of attorney For Health Care |accessdate=2008-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many jurisdictions a health care power of attorney is also referred to as a "[[health care proxy]]" and, as such, the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=expertlaw1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How a Power of Attorney Works|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/estate_planning/power_of_attorney.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|publisher=ExpertLaw|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relationship with advance health care directive====
Related to the health care power of attorney is a separate document known as an [[advance health care directive]], also called a "living will". A [[living will]] is a written statement of a person's health care and medical wishes but does not appoint another person to make health care decisions. Depending upon the jurisdiction, a health care power of attorney may or may not appear with an advance health care directive in a single, physical document. For example, the California legislature has adopted a standard power of attorney for health care and advance health care directive form that meets all of that state's legal wording requirements for a power of attorney and advance health care directive in a single document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Elias|title=Gratuitous Transfers: Wills, Intestate Succession, Trusts, Gifts, Future Interests, and Estate and Gift Taxation|year=2007|publisher=Thomson/West|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=978-0-314-16040-9|pages=311|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare this to New York State, which enacted a Health Care Proxy law that requires a separate document be prepared appointing one as your health care agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New York Code, Public Health Law, Sec. 2981|publisher=State of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Springing===
In some U.S. states and other jurisdictions, it is possible to grant a ''springing power of attorney''; i.e., a power that takes effect only after the incapacity of the grantor or some other definite future act or circumstance.&lt;ref name=ppl /&gt; After such incapacitation the power is identical to a durable power, but cannot be invoked before the incapacity. This power may be used to allow a spouse or family member to manage the grantor's affairs in case illness or injury makes the grantor unable to act.&lt;ref name=spring&gt;{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=Financial Power of Attorney|url=http://www.aarp.org/relationships/caregiving-resource-center/info-11-2010/lfm_financial_power_of_attorney.html|publisher=AARP|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a ''springing'' power is used, the grantor should specify exactly how and when the power ''springs'' into effect. As the result of [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|privacy legislation in the U.S.]], medical doctors will often not reveal information relating to capacity of the principal unless the power of attorney specifically authorizes them to do so.

Determining whether the principal is "disabled" enough to initiate this type of representation is a formal process. Springing powers of attorney are not automatic, and institutions may refuse to work with the attorney-in-fact. Disputes are then resolved in court.

Unless the power of attorney has been made irrevocable by its own terms or by some legal principle, the grantor may revoke the power of attorney by telling the attorney-in-fact it is revoked.  However, if the principal does not inform third parties and it is reasonable for the third parties to rely upon the power of attorney being in force, the principal might still be bound by the acts of the agent, though the agent may also be liable for such unauthorized acts.

===Standardized forms===
Standardized forms are available for various kinds of powers of attorney, and many organizations provide them for their clients, customers, patients, employees, or members.  However, the grantor should exercise caution when using a standardized POA form obtained from a source other than a lawyer because there is considerable variation in approved formats among the states.&lt;ref name=expertlaw1/&gt; In some states statutory power of attorney forms are available. Examples include the [http://www.ssrplaw.com/files/ca_stautory_pofa.pdf California Statutory Form Power of Attorney], [http://easternabstractny.com/pdf/POA-new.PDF New York Form Power of Attorney] and [http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/forms/advdirectives/F00036.pdf Wisconsin Form Power of Attorney].

==Implied limitations on agent's power==
Although a power of attorney grants the agent powers to perform acts in the absence of the grantor, the POA cannot grant powers to the agent that conflict with rules and regulations governing people and companies that the agent deals with.  For example, if a bank has regulations that require the grantor to be physically present in the bank to perform certain actions, the POA cannot grant the agent power to perform those actions in the absence of the grantor.

==Specialized uses==

===Proxy voting===
[[Robert's Rules of Order]] notes that [[proxy voting]] involves granting a power of attorney. The term "proxy" refers to both the power of attorney itself and the person to whom it is granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite parl|title = RONR|edition = 11th|year = 2011|pages = 428}}(RONR)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finance===
In financial situations wherein a principal requests a securities broker to perform extensive investment functions on the principal's behalf, independent of the principal's advice, power of attorney must be formally granted to the broker to trade in the principal's account. This rule also applies to principals who instruct their brokers to perform certain specific trades and principals who trust their brokers to perform certain trades in the principal's best interest.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Legal status by country==
=== Australia ===
In Australia, anyone with capacity can grant a power of attorney.  This can be done either for a pre-defined period of time, or in perpetuity ("enduring").  The power of attorney can be granted to one individual, or to multiple individuals.  When granted to multiple individuals, they may be authorised either to act jointly (all together) or to act severally (each can act individually).  

===England and Wales===
In English and Welsh law, anyone with capacity can grant a power of attorney. These can be general (i.e., to do anything which can legally be done by an attorney), or relate to a specific act (e.g., to sell freehold property). A power of attorney is only valid while the donor has the capacity to ratify the attorney's actions, unless it is made in the form of a [[lasting power of attorney]] and registered with the [[Office of the Public Guardian (England and Wales)|Office of the Public Guardian]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} This new form of power of attorney was introduced in 2007 under the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]] and replaced the former [[enduring power of attorney]], although EPAs correctly made before the law changed are still valid. EPAs only need to be registered if the donor has since lost capacity.

The [[Office of the Public Guardian (England and Wales)|Office of the Public Guardian]] provides online process for registering power of attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Make a lasting power of attorney|url=https://www.lastingpowerofattorney.service.gov.uk/home|website=Gov.UK|publisher=U.K. Government Digital Service|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the provisions in the earlier paragraphs above use terminology different from either common UK usage or terms used in the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]]. Examples are enduring power of attorney, advance directive, and notary public.

===Republic of Ireland===
In Irish law there are two forms of power of attorney:
*Power of attorney, which may be general or specific, which ceases once the donor becomes incapacitated&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/before_a_death/power_of_attorney.html|title=Power of Attorney|accessdate=27 February 2017}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)] license.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Enduring power of attorney, which takes effect once the donor is incapacitated&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;
The death of the donor ends both.&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;

The relevant legislation is the Powers of Attorney Act 1996 and the Enduring Powers of Attorney Regulations 1996 (SI No. 196/1996) as amended by [[Statutory Instrument|SI]] No. 287/1996.&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt; Part 7 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides for new arrangements for those who wish to make an Enduring Power of Attorney and once the 2015 act is commenced, no new powers of attorney will be created under the 1996 act.&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;

====Creating powers of attorney====
A solicitor is not necessary when creating Power of Attorney - it can be created when signed by the donor in the presence of a witness.&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;

Creating an Enduring Power of Attorney requires the following:
*it must be in a particular format&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;
*a statement from a doctor stating that the doctor thought the donor had the mental capacity to understand the effect of creating the power of attorney when the document was executed&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;
*a statement from the donor to say that they understood the effect of creating the power&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;
*a statement from a solicitor to say they are satisfied that the donor understood the effect of creating the power of attorney&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;
*a statement from a solicitor to say the donor was not acting under undue influence&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;

The courts play a general supervisory role in the implementation of the power.&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;

===Russia===
Under Russian law, specifically art. 185 of the Russian Civil Code, a power of attorney may be executed under hand or in notarial form.&lt;ref name="base.garant.ru"&gt;[http://base.garant.ru/10164072/10/#1010 See the Civil Code of Russian Federation (in Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt; The power of attorney to act must be notarially executed. Notarial execution is required for any power of attorney made for concluding a contract subject to special public recordation, namely those dealing with interests in immovable property.&lt;ref&gt;See Section 16 of Act 122 of 200З "On state registration of interests in immovable property and related transactions" (in Russian) [http://base.garant.ru/11901341/3/]&lt;/ref&gt;

A power of attorney, pursuant to art. 186 of the Russian Civil Code, must also be dated.&lt;ref name="base.garant.ru"/&gt; Any POA without an express date of execution is void.

;''[[Predstavitelstvo]]'', ''[[:ru:Доверенность|Doverennost]]'' {{ru icon}}
A power of attorney cannot be irrevocable. The grantor may terminate the POA at any time at his or her sole discretion. Any waiver of this right is void, as provided by the Civil Code.

===Scotland===
The Office of the Public Guardian in Scotland offers the eAttorney Electronic Power of Attorney (EPOAR) system for the submission and payment of powers of attorney registrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How do I make a submission?|url=http://www.publicguardian-scotland.gov.uk/power-of-attorney/epoar/submitting-a-power-of-attorney|website=Office of the Public Guardian (Scotland)|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Process-based management''' is a management approach that views a business as a collection of processes, managed to achieve a desired result.&lt;ref&gt;"''Process-based Management''" Barron's Business Guides: Dictionary of Accounting Terms, Jae K. Shim et al., Barron's Educational Series, 2014. Credo Reference, Accessed 09 Oct 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The processes are managed and improved by organisation in purpose of achieving their [[Goal|vision]], [[mission statement|mission]] and core value. A clear correlation between processes and the vision supports the company to plan strategies, build a business structure and use sufficient resources that are required to achieve success in the long run.&lt;ref name="achievingpbm" /&gt;

From a process perspective, an organisation regards its business as a system of vision-achieving vertical processes rather than specific activities and tasks of individual functions. (19:25) The system is not a method or tool for a particular process, but a holistic approach to manage all the processes in one organisation. Therefore, to manage processes effectively, the organisation must have an effective [[teamwork|team network]] and full knowledge of their vision.

The general management system focuses on specific work-knowledge and direct solutions for cost and [[budget]]; on the other hand, process based management applies these financial measurements but in an operational way considering how each performance affects the company as an amalgam of different processes. As a result of recent advances in technology and increased international competition, more companies aim for better methods of grouping and integrating organisational activities.&lt;ref name="newapproach" /&gt;

==Vision, Mission and Values==

[[vision statement|Vision]], [[mission statement|mission]] and core value are three crucial factors to manage an organisation from a process perspective. Considering the vision, mission and value as a direction of their business, an organisation can build their corporate strategy and determine the processes they will take into account.&lt;ref name="processstrategygroup"&gt;[http://www.processstrategygroup.com/uploads/PBM_Assessment.pdf], Process Strategy Group. ''Introduction to Process Based Management: What every organisation needs to know about PBM'' [online]. UK:Process Strategy Group, 2010 [Accessed 12 October 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the organisation obtains strengths and competitiveness among other companies.

First, the [[vision statement|vision]] is an aspirational purpose what the organisation would like to achieve in the long run.&lt;ref name="processstrategygroup" /&gt; The vision leads the company to challenge various tasks and develop its own business strategy. In other words, the organisation considers vision as a motivation to build a business structure, determine strategic plans and manage human resources. Therefore, the company carries out the ‘vision-achieving operations’ as their primary goals.

[[mission statement|Mission]] is a fundamental purpose of a company that remains unchanged over time. The mission provides a guidance for decision making and gives a path to successful results.&lt;ref name="businessdictionary"&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/mission-statement.html], Business Dictionary [Accessed 18 October 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, mission is different from a vision in that mission is a something to be achieved whereas a vision is something to be aimed for achievement.&lt;ref name="iso"&gt;[http://shop.bsigroup.com/upload/Shop/Download/Books/BIP2014sample.pdf] Rosam, I., Peddle, R.

Core Values is a principle that helps companies to determine whether the actions and decisions are right or wrong. The value is essential to take decision-making and sustain the company’s long-term success.&lt;ref name="boeing"&gt;[http://www.omg.org/news/meetings/workshops/soa-bpm-mda-2006/01-1_Farrar.pdf] David F.

==Advantages of process-based management==

* Documenting a process provides a clear guideline of how organisation improves their processes and performances over time.&lt;ref name="netcoach"&gt;[http://www.netcoach.eu.com/index.php?id=38], Ward, M. ''What is a process and processed-based management system?'' [online]. Ireland: Netcoach, 2011 [Accessed 12 October 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Process based management measures the full set of activities in one business. For instance, it focuses on internal processes such as [[customer satisfaction]], quality of product and security as well as financial results including [[revenue]]s, profits, costs, and [[budget]].&lt;ref name="newapproach"&gt;[http://www.iaeng.org/publication/IMECS2009/IMECS2009_pp1742-1747.pdf] Badreddine, A., Romdhane, T.B., and Amor, N.B. Proceedings of the International MultiConference of Engineers and Computer Scientists. ''A New Process-Based Approach for Implementing an Integrated Management System: Quality, Security, Environment,'' 2009; 2:2-6&lt;/ref&gt;
* Understanding of the correlations between business processes avoids taking wrong decisions. It reduces costs, time and resources wasting on unnecessary things.&lt;ref name="achievingpbm"&gt;[http://www.leonardo.com.au/documents/achievingprocessbasedmanagementv2.pdf]. Leonardo Consulting. ''Why Process-Based Management?'' [online]. Australia: Leonardo Consulting, 2010 [Accessed 14 October 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Analysing the processes, an organisation will be able to predict sources of hazard and choose right decisions.&lt;ref name="newapproach" /&gt;
* The system protects [[intellectual capital]] of the organisation. Monitoring the development of processes, the organisation can analyse risks and its weakness.&lt;ref name="achievingpbm" /&gt;
* Focusing on continuous improvement and customer’s requirements, the organisation improves [[customer service]]s which deliver value to its customers.
* Evaluating the process assures the results a company expecting to obtain.
* Process based management is an integration of both input and output in business process. It controls personnel, technical and financial resources in a holistic viewpoint.&lt;ref name="newapproach" /&gt;
* The organisation can improve IT system that reduces unnecessary complexity and improves the quality of performance measurement.
* Analysing processes and implementing new objects if required, the organisation deal with fast changes in demand.

==Three stages in process-based management==

===Documenting the process===

To manage its business from a process based perspective, an organisation requires to understand what defines the process and which activities they consist of.

A business consists of different departments in charge of specific jobs or functions. Therefore, the processes support these managerial sectors and transform successful outputs. Then a process team performs a set of sequential tasks to analyse whether the organisation delivers useful outputs to the customers.

Basically, processes are built by information that indicates the current state of company and research data such as customer satisfaction. The information includes [[service-level agreement|customer-based agreement]], management documentation, purchasing manuals and [[flowchart|flow charts]].&lt;ref name="iso" /&gt; For instance, the flow chart is a useful information in order to control the flow of processes and list several steps and activities in detail.

===Analysing process performance===

Analysed and clarified processes are allowed to implement on the actual business. Then, an organisation monitors its business and improves the overall stage of process.

To evaluate the sequence of process, measurement is an essential element that shows results of process performance with numerical and comparative data. In other words, organisations obtain a relevant analysis using the measurements that can be shown as graphical representations such as [[pie chart]]s, [[bar chart]]s, cause-and-effect analysis, and [[gap analysis]].&lt;ref name="iso" /&gt;

Many organisations highly depend on data and visual analysis processed by information system. For this reason, organisation must obtain accurate analysis based on exact data and must be cautious for mistaken output that impacts whole process of their business.

As a result, the measurements help the company to analyse current state of performance and give guidance for the firm’s sustainable improvements.

===Implementing the improvements===

Having designed the processes of management system and analysed the performances using useful measurements, the final step is how to improve the system and maintain its effectiveness. Therefore, implementing the improvements is a key activity to examine the processes and improve the flow of the management system.

An organisation determines which part of processes must be improved and modified. It analyses how each process influences a set of activities and applies the improvements to some parts of system. The purpose of implementation is to operate its business strategically and to deliver sufficient resources. In effect, the process based management results in outputs that satisfy their customers and develop the business itself.

[[File:FMIB 33966 Removing Blubber from Whale Beached on California Coast.jpeg|thumb|Rendering a beached whale in California]]
'''Rendering''' is a process that converts waste animal [[biological tissue|tissue]] into stable, usable materials. Rendering can refer to any processing of [[animal product]]s into more useful materials, or, more narrowly, to the rendering of whole animal fatty tissue into purified fats like [[lard]] or [[tallow]]. Rendering can be carried out on an industrial, farm, or kitchen [[Scalability|scale]].

The majority of tissue processed comes from [[slaughterhouse]]s, but also includes restaurant grease and butcher shop trimmings and expired meat from grocery stores. This material can include the [[fat]]ty tissue, bones, and [[offal]], as well as entire carcasses of animals condemned at slaughterhouses, and those that have died on farms, in transit, etc. The most common animal sources are [[beef]], [[pork]], [[sheep]], and [[poultry]].

The rendering process simultaneously dries the material and separates the fat from the [[bone]] and [[protein]]. A rendering process yields a fat [[commodity]] ([[yellow grease]], choice white grease, bleachable fancy [[tallow]], etc.) and a protein meal ([[meat and bone meal]], poultry byproduct meal, etc.).

Rendering plants often also handle other materials, such as slaughterhouse [[blood]], [[feather]]s and [[hair]], but do so using processes distinct from true rendering.

The occupation of renderer has appeared in "dirtiest jobs" lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/dirtiest-jobs/story?id=17130057#2 |title=The Seven Dirtiest Jobs |website=ABC News |date=Sep 3, 2012 |accessdate=29 January 2014 |author=Ellin, Abby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process variations==
The rendering process varies in a number of ways:
* Whether the end products are used as human or animal food depends on the quality of input material and the processing methods and equipment.
* The material may be processed by wet or dry means. In wet processing, either boiling water or steam is added to the material, separating fat into a floating phase. In dry processing, fat is released by dehydrating the raw material.
* The temperature range used may be high or low.
* Rendering may be done either in discrete batches or in a continuous process.
* The processing plant may be operated by an independent company that buys input material from suppliers, or by a packing plant that produces the material in-house.

==Rendering processes for edible products==
Edible rendering processes are basically meat processing operations and produce [[lard]] or edible [[tallow]] for use in food products. Edible rendering is generally carried out in a continuous process at low temperature (less than the boiling point of water). The process usually consists of finely chopping the edible fat materials (generally fat trimmings from meat cuts), heating them with or without added steam, and then carrying out two or more stages of [[centrifugal separation]]. The first stage separates the liquid water and fat mixture from the solids. The second stage further separates the fat from the water. The solids may be used in food products, pet foods, etc., depending on the original materials. The separated fat may be used in food products, or if in surplus, may be diverted to soap making operations. Most edible rendering is done by meat packing or processing companies.

One edible product is [[Greaves (food)|greaves]], which is the unmeltable residue left after animal fat has been rendered.

An alternative process cooks slaughterhouse [[offal]] to produce a thick, lumpy "stew" for the pet food industry, which uses it principally in tinned [[Cat food|cat]] and [[dog food]]s. Such plants are notable for the offensive odour that they can produce, and are often located well away from human habitation.

==Rendering processes for inedible products==
Materials that for aesthetic or sanitary reasons are not suitable for human food are the feedstocks for inedible rendering processes. Much of the inedible raw material is rendered using the "dry" method. This may be a batch or a continuous process in which the material is heated in a steam-jacketed vessel to drive off the moisture and simultaneously release the fat from the fat cells. The material is first ground, then heated to release the fat and drive off the moisture, percolated to drain off the free fat, and then more fat is pressed out of the solids, which at this stage are called "cracklings" or "dry-rendered tankage". The cracklings are further ground to make meat and [[bone meal]].

A variation on a dry process involves finely chopping the material, fluidizing it with hot fat, and then evaporating the mixture in one or more evaporator stages. Some inedible rendering is done using a wet process, which is generally a continuous process similar in some ways to that used for edible materials. The material is heated with added steam and then pressed to remove a water-fat mixture that is then separated into fat, water, and fine solids by stages of centrifuging and/or evaporation. The solids from the press are dried and then ground into meat and bone meal. Most independent renderers process only inedible material.

==History==
The development of rendering was primarily responsible for the profitable utilization of meat industry by-products, which in turn allowed the development of a massive industrial-scale meat industry that made food more economical for the consumer.
Rendering has been carried out for many centuries, primarily for [[soap]] and [[candle]] making. The earliest rendering was done in a [[kettle]] over an open fire. This type of rendering is still done on farms to make lard (pork fat) for food purposes. With the development of steam boilers, it was possible to use steam-jacketed kettles to make a higher grade product, and reduce fire danger. A further development came in the 19th century with the use of steam digesters: a tank used as a pressure cooker where steam was injected into the material being rendered. This process is a wet rendering process called "tanking" and was used for edible and inedible products, although better grades of edible products were made using the open kettle process. After the material is tanked, the free fat is run off, the remaining water ("tank water") run into a separate vat, and the solids removed and dried by pressing and steam-drying in a jacketed vessel. The tank water was either run into a [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] or it was evaporated to make [[glue]] or protein concentrate to add to [[fertilizer]]. The solids were used for fertilizer.

[[Upton Sinclair]] wrote ''[[The Jungle]]'' (1906), an exposé on the Chicago meat processing industry which created public outrage. His work helped the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1907 which paved the way for the creation of the [[FDA]].

The pressure tank made possible the development of the [[Chicago]] meat industry in the United States, with its concentration in one geographic area, because it allowed the economic disposal of byproducts which would otherwise overwhelm the environment in that area. At first, small companies that sprang up near the packers did the rendering. Later the packers entered the rendering industry. [[Gustavus Swift]], [[Nelson Morris]], and [[Lucius Darling]] were among the early pioneers of the U.S. rendering industry with their personal backing and/or direct participation in the rendering industry.

Innovations came rapidly in the 20th century. Some of these were the uses for rendered products, and others were the rendering methods. In the 1920s, a batch dry rendering process was invented; the material was cooked in horizontal steam-jacketed cylinders (similar to the fertilizer dryers of the day). Advantages claimed for the dry process were economy of energy, better protein yield, faster processing, and fewer obnoxious odors. Over the years, the wet "tanking" process was replaced with the dry process. By the end of [[World War II]], most rendering installations used the dry process. In the 1960s, continuous dry processes were introduced, one using a variation of the conventional dry cooker and the other making use of a mincing and evaporation process to dry the material and yield the fat. In the 1980s, high energy costs popularized the various "wet" continuous processes. These processes were more energy efficient and allowed the re-use of process vapours to pre-heat or dry the materials during the process.

After [[WWII]], synthetic detergents arrived, which displaced soaps in domestic and industrial washing. In the early 1950s, over half of the inedible fat market vanished. Diversion in these materials into animal feeds soon replaced the lost soap market and eventually became the single largest use for inedible fats.

The widespread use of "boxed beef", where the beef was cut into consumer portions at packing plants rather than local butcher shops and markets, meant that fat and meat scraps for renderers stayed at the packing plants and were rendered there by packer renderers, rather than by the independent rendering companies.

The rejection of animal fats by diet-conscious consumers led to a surplus of edible fats, and the resultant diversion into soapmaking and [[oleochemical]]s, displacing inedible fats and contributing to the market volatility of this commodity.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The rendering industry is one of the oldest recycling industries, and made possible the development of a large food industry. The industry takes what would otherwise be waste materials and makes useful products such as fuels, soaps, rubber, plastics, etc. At the same time, rendering solves what would otherwise be a major disposal problem. As an example, the USA recycles more than 21 million metric tons annually of highly perishable and noxious organic matter. In 2004, the U.S. industry produced over 8 million metric tons of products, of which 1.6 million metric tons were exported.

Usually, materials used as raw materials in the rendering process are susceptible to spoilage. However, after rendering, the materials are much more resistant to spoiling. This is due to the application of heat either through cooking in the wet rendering process or the extraction of fluid in the dry rendering process. The fat obtained can be used as low-cost raw material in making grease, animal feed, soap, candles, [[biodiesel]], and as a feed-stock for the [[chemical]] industry. [[Tallow]], derived from beef waste, is an important raw material in the [[steel]] rolling industry providing the required lubrication when compressing steel sheets.

Meat and bones (in a dry, ground state) are converted to ''[[meat and bone meal]]''. Health professionals believe that meat and bone meal in animal feed was the main route for the late-20th century spread of [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad-cow disease, BSE), which is also fatal to human beings. Early in the 21st century, most countries tightened regulations to prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?contentid=BSE_FAQs.xml |title=FAQ on BSE |website=United States Department of Agriculture |access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If not for the rendering industry, the cost of waste animal material would be high and would place a significant economic and environmental burden on areas involved in industrial scale slaughtering. This cost would manifest itself through the use of expensive sanitary landfills, incinerators, and other similar waste disposal techniques without yielding profit from [[opportunity costs]]. Alternatives to rendering products may not reduce cost.

==Kitchen rendering==
Rendering of fats is also carried out on a kitchen scale by [[chef]]s and home cooks. In the kitchen, rendering is used to transform [[butter]] into [[clarified butter]], [[suet]] into [[tallow]], [[pork]] fat into [[lard]], and chicken fat into [[schmaltz]].

In 2003, it was renamed for 1st Mariner Bank, which purchased [[naming rights]] to the arena for 10 years. It was reported that 1st Mariner Bank paid the city $75,000 a year to keep the naming rights to the complex. When this naming rights agreement ended in 2013, the arena was briefly returned to its "Baltimore Arena" name, until [[Royal Farms]] purchased the naming rights in September 2014.&lt;ref name=CBSLocalRFA /&gt; This deal calls for Royal Farms to pay $250,000 annually for five years to the city, and gives Royal Farms first rights to renew or restructure their deal at the end of the contract, or in the event that the city constructs a new arena.&lt;ref name=BBJRFA&gt;{{cite web |first1=Ryan |last1=Sharrow |work=[[Baltimore Business Journal]] |title=Royal Farms taking over naming rights to Baltimore Arena |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2014/09/15/royal-farms-naming-rights-at-baltimore-arena.html |date=September 15, 2014 |accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cornerstone to the Arena was laid in 1961 with a vault that included messages from then-U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]], then-[[Maryland]] governor [[J. Millard Tawes]], and then-Baltimore Mayor [[J. Harold Grady]]. The vault was opened in 2006.

The current site that was chosen for the Baltimore Civic Center was actually not one of the many sites proposed to the [[Greater Baltimore Committee]] in 1955. Among nine suggested locations were two in [[Druid Hill Park]], three at the end of the Inner Harbor basin (where the [[Baltimore World Trade Center|World Trade Center]] and [[Harborplace]] are now located), and one in [[Clifton Park, Baltimore|Clifton Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Report No. 5781 to Greater Baltimore Committee, Inc. on Proposed Civic Center for Baltimore, Nov 1, 1955.

==History==
[[File:Baltimore Arenanight2 (002).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Royal Farms Arena view from the northeast (corner of Baltimore Sreet and Hopkins Place)]]

===1960s–1970s===
The Arena has been host to many events, including music, boxing, wrestling, and other sports.

From 1962 through 1976, the [[Baltimore Clippers]] of the [[American Hockey League]] played their home games at the Arena. The Clippers withdrew from the AHL in mid-season, 1974–75, to allow the [[Baltimore Blades]] (the relocated [[Michigan Stags]]) of the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) to finish their season. The Clippers regrouped for one final AHL season 1975–76. The Arena has hosted two other AHL franchises: the [[Baltimore Skipjacks]] lasted from 1981 to 1993, and the [[Baltimore Bandits]] played two seasons from 1995 to 1997.

In 1962, the Arena hosted a boxing match between [[Joey Giardello]] and [[Johnny Morris]].

Also in 1963, the Arena became the home of the [[Baltimore Bullets (1963–73)|Baltimore Bullets]], who played there until 1973.

[[The Beatles]] performed at the Arena on September 13, 1964, to a total of 28,000 attendees in two performances on the same day, at 4:00 pm and 8:30 pm.

On April 3, 1965, defending WWWF champion [[Bruno Sammartino]] defeated [[Gene Kiniski]] in a return title match.  Just a few months later, in January 1966, Kiniski would win the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) title.

In 1966, Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] gave a speech, "Race and the Church", before a gathering of Methodist clergy at the Baltimore Civic Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ubalt.edu/template.cfm?page=1639 University of Baltimore: Riots and Rebirth Project Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[NBA All-Star Game]] was played at the Arena in 1969.

The venue also hosted [[Led Zeppelin]] several times through the early 1970s. A couple of scenes from the Led Zeppelin concert film ''[[The Song Remains the Same (film)|The Song Remains the Same]]'' were filmed backstage.

On June 13, 1970, [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]] played the Civic Center with a last-minute decision to visit from New York and sold out. This was noted to be one of the best performances of the whole 1970 tour and was one of the last shows Hendrix played before his death a few months later.

Elvis Presley played the Civic Center twice: Tuesday Nov. 9, 1971, 8:30pm (wearing the Red Lion Suit) and Sunday May 29, 1977 8:30pm (wearing the Mexican Sundial Suit). These were less than three months before his untimely death. Both shows were complete sell-outs.

The [[Grateful Dead]]'s performance on September 17, 1972, was recorded and later released as ''[[Dick's Picks Volume 23]]''. It contains the complete concert, except for the encore, which was "[[One More Saturday Night (song)|One More Saturday Night]]". It contains the longest CD version of "The Other One", to date, at nearly 40 minutes long.

In 1974, the World Team Tennis (WTT) Baltimore Banners played their home games there. Number 1 in the world [[Jimmy Connors]] was on that team. After Connors defeated [[Ken Roswall]] in Wimbledon they played each other at the Arena in a rematch. Billie Jean King played and coached the Philadelphia Freedoms of the WTT. Also, [[John Newcomb]] played there in the WTT.

The Civic Center was host to the 1974 and 1975 [[MEAC Men's Basketball Tournament]].

In 1975, professional basketball returned briefly with the [[Baltimore Claws]] of the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA). The [[Memphis Sounds]] relocated to Baltimore following the 1974–75 ABA season and were first called the Baltimore Hustlers, before changing their name. Troubled financially from the start, the Claws folded after three road exhibition games.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.remembertheaba.com/Baltimore-Claws.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s–1990s===
The Arena was the home of the Major Indoor Soccer League's [[Baltimore Blast (1980–92)|Baltimore Blast]] since their arrival in the 1980–1981 season until the league folded in 1992. The Blast won their only championship in the 1983-84 season which was attended by upwards of 11,200 fans. The Blast, regardless of incarnation, were the longest-serving tenant in the Arena's history.

The Arena was the home of the Major Indoor Lacrosse League (MILL) and later the [[National Lacrosse League]] (NLL) [[Baltimore Thunder]] from 1987 through 1999. The Thunder won the inaugural MILL championship. Notable players include [[Gary Gait]], Tom Gravante (head Men's Lacrosse coach at [[Mount St. Mary's University]]) and Hugh Donovan.

The Arena was a frequent venue for [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (NWA) and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW). Starting in 1988, [[The Great American Bash]] pay-per-view was held at the Arena eight times. It also hosted [[SuperBrawl V]] in 1995. Sting defeated Ric Flair to win his first NWA World Championship at 1990's Great American Bash, and Ron Simmons upset Vader in 1992 for the WCW title, becoming the first African-American to hold a major world title. The [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] was reformed in 1999 at the Royal Farms Arena with [[Bret Hart]], [[Kevin Nash]], [[Scott Hall]] and [[Jeff Jarrett]] on the Nitro after [[Starrcade (1999)|Starrcade]]

The Arena has also hosted many [[WWE]] events over the years.

In 1995, the Arena was host to the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Men's Basketball Division 1 games (Rounds 1 &amp; 2).

The NBA [[Washington Bullets]] played a few home games at the Arena during the 1990s. Their final game at the Arena was a 94-87 victory over the [[Dallas Mavericks]] on March 29, 1997.

===2000s===
The Arena has also been a staple on the [[Professional Bull Riders|PBR]]'s [[Built Ford Tough Series]] [[bull riding]] tour. It first visited the Arena from 2001 to 2003, then came back again from 2008 to 2010. It returned in 2012 and again in 2015.

In July 2004, the Arena was host to the US debut of Japanese rock band [[L'Arc-en-Ciel]], as part of the [[anime]] and east Asian culture convention [[Otakon]].

==Proposed replacement==
On October 16, 2004, ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' revealed that official steps had been taken toward replacing the Arena, then 42 years old. The [[Maryland Stadium Authority]] had started soliciting proposals for a feasibility study on building an Arena in downtown Baltimore, due on November 1, 2004. According to the request for proposals, the new Arena would be built on the same site of Royal Farms Arena and "would have a smaller [[seating capacity]] than would be required for an NHL or NBA team" but it did not set a specific seating capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/bal-sp.arena16oct16,1,6216653.story Ideas solicited for city arena] Requires Site Registration&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15, 2006, ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' reported that the feasibility study started in 2004 had been released publicly and the study stated that the current Arena had "served its useful life" and that Baltimore must build a new Arena or face the risk of losing events.  The study rejected a proposal to repair the Arena's aging systems, citing an estimated cost of $60 million, and instead suggested that the city demolish Royal Farms Arena and build a new Arena on the same site or elsewhere in Baltimore. Notably the proposed new Arena would seat only 15,000 to 16,000 people; the study assumed that Baltimore would never be successful in attracting a major pro team in the future; however, city officials were still open to this idea.

Conceivably, the new arena could be successful in attracting a minor-league hockey team, bringing more than 200 new jobs and generating up to $1 million in additional tax revenue. City officials have said that the private sector would need to bear the brunt of the estimated $162-million construction cost of the new arena, as the city is also considering giving up ownership of the arena. The [[Baltimore Development Corporation]] (BDC) stated that it would begin seeking interested developers for the project by June 2007. BDC's President M. J. "Jay" Brodie said it was a "miracle" that the current Arena books as many events as it does in its current state. City officials have said the location of the new Arena would be dependent on what the developers suggest.  Officials stated that they are equally comfortable with keeping the current Arena, building the new Arena in a new location, then demolishing the current Arena, or encouraging a mixed-use development in the site of the current Arena. Advocates for downtown, including the Downtown Partnership and the Westside Renaissance, want the new Arena to remain in the downtown area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/baltimore_city/bal-te.md.ci.arena15may15002653,1,7651568,print.story?coll=bal-local-headlines&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 2007, [[WJZ 13]] reported that seven sites have been submitted to the BDC for a new Arena, and the choices will be narrowed down by the Spring of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://wjz.com/seenon/arena.baltimore.charm.2.570624.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24, 2008, it was reported that the new Arena will be built on the same site as the current one, with a capacity of upwards of 18,500. It was unknown at that time what would happen to concerts and events while construction is underway, or who would develop the new Arena. However, there have been talks about building a temporary facility for events. The Arena was planned to be completed within three years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wbaltv.com/news/16980285/detail.html?rss=bal&amp;psp=news&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, 2008, ''The Baltimore Sun'' reported that developers were looking for designers to build an apartment building and outdoor shopping stores to be a part of the new Royal Farms Arena.  Also, the developers announced that they were accepting all design proposals until November 26, 2008, and that, by the summer of 2009, they planned to make a final design decision.

On December 17, 2008, the ''[[Baltimore Examiner]]'' reported that the Baltimore Development Corp. had received four proposals for the Royal Farms Arena replacement that could take away a "major entertainment venue" for Baltimore for up to "4 years" and the estimated price is $300 million, but could be more depending on additional retail and hotel uses. The Arena is reported to be an 18,500-seat venue built on the site of the current Royal Farms Arena. The four proposals were:

'''ESmith Legacy and Garfield Traub Development:''' ESmith Legacy was a team led by former NFL player [[Emmitt Smith]] that has offices in Baltimore. This proposal included the following features in addition to the larger Arena:

*7-screen movie theater
*20,000 square feet of retail space
*1,000-seat concert venue

'''Streuver Brothers Eccles &amp; Rouse:''' A well known Baltimore-based developer. This proposal included:

*300-room hotel
*43,000 SF of retail space

'''Cormony Development and Harrison Development:''' Respectively, Rockville- and Baltimore-based development firms who have been involved since 2007. This proposal includes:

*400-room hotel
*240,000 SF office tower
*12,000 SF to 20,000 SF of retail space

'''A&amp;R Development, J Street Development Co., and Accent Development Co.:''' A partnership of Baltimore-based A&amp;R and Washington based J Street and Accent Development under the name Arena Development. This proposal includes:

*Up to 100,000 SF of retail space

The Baltimore Examiner reported that the BDC could make a decision on the developer as soon as mid-2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Cannarsa|title=New downtown arena project draws four interested parties|work=[[The Baltimore Examiner]]|date=2008-12-17|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 2009, ArenaDigest.com reported that Baltimore City officials had postponed their plans for constructing a new Arena, due in part to the [[Late-2000s recession|struggling economy]], and the officials' decision split between building either an 18,500-seat Arena for a possible NBA or NHL franchise, or constructing a mid-size facility for concerts, family events, and minor league sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baltimore puts off decision on new downtown arena|publisher=''Arena Digest''|date=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on November 12, 2010, with the recession rebounding, Mayor [[Stephanie Rawlings-Blake]] announced that city officials were considering new sites for a new arena. The plan called for Royal Farms Arena to remain open, while a new arena was constructed. While Rawlings-Blake believed that the new Arena would most likely to be erected in the city's West Side, the Greater Baltimore Committee suggested building the Arena as an expansion to the Baltimore Convention Center, to help re-develop the [[Inner Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GBC proposes Inner Harbor redevelopment to expand Convention Center, add sports arena|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-11-12/business/bs-bz-arena-convention-gbc-20101112_1_gbc-sports-arena-convention-space|work=Baltimore Sun|date=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost would range from $750 to $930 million, since it would include the 18,500-seat Arena, {{convert|400,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} expansion of the Baltimore Convention Center, an underground garage, and a new 500-room Sheraton hotel; the proposed Arena site is where the current Sheraton hotel rests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arena, convention center idea could cost nearly $1B|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2010/12/16/arena-convention-center-proposal.html |work=Baltimore Business Journal|date=2010-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 2015, [[David S. Cordish]], the chairman and CEO of the [[Cordish Company]], proposed to build a 15,000–16,000-seat waterfront Arena, but built with expanded capacity in mind. The Arena, accommodated with an outdoor amphitheater and a pedestrian bridge to connect the [[Inner Harbor]] and [[Federal Hill, Baltimore|Federal Hill]], would cost $450 million and tie up with [[Harbor East]] and [[Power Plant Live]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exclusive: Cordish floating plans to build Inner Harbor arena on Piers 5 and 6|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2015/01/14/cordish-floating-plans-to-build-inner-harbor-arena.html?page=all |work=Baltimore Business Journal|date=2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Cordish proposal was scrapped when Maryland Governor [[Larry Hogan]] cancelled the [[Red Line (Baltimore)|Red Line]], project, which was a dire need for the Arena.

On August 3, 2016, talks about the convention center/Arena proposal resumed. Since then, a few more studies for a new arena have been planned, including a possible renovation of Royal Farms Arena and construction of a new Arena at the city's [[State Center station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Team name to study convention center expansion, possible new arena|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-bz-convention-center-study-20170504-story.html?page=all |work=Baltimore Sun|date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
The Royal Farms Arena is immediately adjacent to the [[University Center/Baltimore Street Light Rail Stop|University Center/Baltimore Street stop]] on the [[Baltimore Light Rail]]. The [[Charles Center Metro Subway Station]] and many bus lines are also nearby.

'''Russian Accounting Standards''' ('''RAS'''; {{lang-ru|Российские стандарты бухгалтерского учёта, РСБУ}}), also called '''Russian Accounting Principles''' ('''RAP''') or '''Russian GAAP''', refer to the body of regulatory documents concerning financial accounting and reporting standards in the [[Russian Federation]].&lt;ref name="KPMG"&gt;{{cite press release | title=IFRS compared to Russian GAAP: An overview | publisher=[[KPMG International]] | date=October 2005 | page=7 | url=http://www.kpmg.com/CN/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/IFRS-compared-to-Russian-GAAP-O-200510.pdf | accessdate=2011-12-22 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407070508/http://www.kpmg.com/CN/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/IFRS-compared-to-Russian-GAAP-O-200510.pdf | archive-date=2012-04-07 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For historical reasons, the Russian Accounting Standards framework has been determined by the state, rather by professional bodies.&lt;ref name="iaspl"&gt;{{cite web |title=Financial Reporting Framework in Russia |url=https://www.iasplus.com/en/jurisdictions/europe/russia |website=iasplus.com |accessdate=28 October 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015194743/http://www.iasplus.com/en/jurisdictions/europe/russia |archive-date=2016-10-15 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary users of RAS are state and tax authorities, rather than management or third parties.&lt;ref name="iaspl"/&gt; RAS financial statements must include [[balance sheet]], [[income statement]], [[statement of changes in equity]], [[cash flow statement]] and explanatory notes.&lt;ref name="iaspl"/&gt; Under RAS, a specific layout is mandatory for the balance sheet and other statements.&lt;ref name="eycomp"/&gt;

The Russian government has been striving to harmonize Russian Accounting Standards with IFRS since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Russia to Fully Adopt International Accounting Rules by 2018 |url=https://sputniknews.com/business/20130223179634843-Russia-to-Fully-Adopt-International-Accounting-Rules-by-2018----/ |accessdate=28 October 2018 |work=sputniknews.com |date=23 February 2013 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010041732/https://sputniknews.com/business/20130223179634843-Russia-to-Fully-Adopt-International-Accounting-Rules-by-2018----/ |archive-date=2017-10-10 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Law No. 208-FZ introduced IFRS into Russian legislation in 2010.&lt;ref name="eycomp"&gt;{{cite web |title=IFRS, US GAAP and RAP: Comparison and basics |url=https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-ifrs-usgaap-rap-2016-eng/$FILE/EY-ifrs-usgaap-rap-2016-eng.pdf |website=EY |accessdate=28 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516144144/http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-ifrs-usgaap-rap-2016-eng/$FILE/EY-ifrs-usgaap-rap-2016-eng.pdf |archive-date=2017-05-16 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, [[IFRS]] have increasingly been adopted in Russia, and they are mandatory for [[consolidated financial statements]], while standalone financial statements must be prepared using RAS.&lt;ref name="iaspl"/&gt; IFRS statements are also required for domestic [[public companies]].&lt;ref name="ifrssite"&gt;{{cite web |title=Russia |url=https://www.ifrs.org/use-around-the-world/use-of-ifrs-standards-by-jurisdiction/russia/ |website=IFRS.org |accessdate=28 October 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216093055/http://www.ifrs.org/use-around-the-world/use-of-ifrs-standards-by-jurisdiction/russia/ |archive-date=2018-02-16 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; IFRS are generally deemed more relevant to the needs of investors.&lt;ref name="kim13"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=Oksana |title=Russian Accounting System: Value Relevance of Reported Information and the IFRS Adoption Perspective |journal=The International Journal of Accounting |date=December 2013 |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=525–547 |doi=10.1016/j.intacc.2013.10.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to IFRS==
Major reasons for deviation between Russian GAAP and IFRS / US-GAAP (e.g. when the Russian affiliate of a larger group need to be consolidated to the mother company) are the following:

# Booking of payables in the [[general ledger]] according to national accounting standards can only be made upon receipt of the actual acceptance protocol (good's receipt). Indeed, in Russia, in contrast to IFRS and US-GAAP, the invoice (outgoing or incoming) is not an official tax or accounting document and does not trigger any booking. There is also no provision to book in the General Ledger any expense for goods and services that according to a contract are effectively received but for whom documents are still not exchanged.
# There is no possibility under Russian GAAP to recognise the good-will as an intangible asset in the balance sheet of a company. This has a major consequence when a company is sold. Indeed, if a company (or part of it) is sold at a higher value than its book value (i.e. to account for the good-will value), the selling party need to pay tax at the relevant profit tax rate (20% in 2013) on the difference in value between selling and accounting value and the buyer has no possibility to amortize the cost and deduct it from present and future revenues.
# There is no equivalent of [[IAS 37]] in the Russian GAAP. Loans and monetary securities are not discounted, so the present value of such financial assets is not discounted for the relevant interest rates at the different maturities of the loans.

'''Share transmission''' is a mechanism by which the title to [[Share (finance)|share]]s is devolved other than by transfer. This is typically applicable for:
* devolution by death
* succession
* inheritance
* bankruptcy
* marriage

When a previous owner of shares dies and his shares are inherited by his personal representatives or heirs, this is called transmission of shares.Shares may be inherited only by production of probate of a will of the deceased owner or letters of administration of his estate granted by the High Court.(section 148 of COMPANIES AND ALLIED MATTERS ACT (CAMA)under NIGERIAN LAW ).  The beneficiaries of the shares by transmission must have their names entered in the register of members of the company or elect a nominee to hold the shares on their behalf.  In this case the nominee’s name shall be entered in the Register of members of the company to become a member of the company.(section 155 (3) of CAMA).

== Transfers on Transmission of shares ==

Transmission of shares occurs when the shares of a deceased share holder are inherited or bequeathed to an heir or personal representative of the deceased shareholder. Where shares are held by two or more persons jointly then upon death of one or more of them, the surviving person shall be entitled to all the shares and they may be transferred to his name. Where the shareholder held the shares as a sole owner, then his shares may be transferred only to the person named in his will or if he died without a will, then to the person who obtains letters of administration from the High Court in respect of the shares or the deceased’s property. Section 148 of CAMA.  The above are in Law recognized as the personal representatives of the deceased share holder and are entitled to have his shares transferred to them or their nominee. (Section 155 of CAMA).

=== Protection of Beneficiaries under a will ===  
Sometimes a deceased member may name some persons as the administrators of his estate who are to ensure the deceased’s properties are distributed and/or managed as stated in the will.  These persons therefore inherit the deceased persons shares on behalf and for the benefit of those who are named in the will as the beneficiaries inherit. The administrators therefore only have an equitable right in the shares but not the beneficial rights.This right becomes a legal right only when the shares are transferred to those entitled under the will.  It is the duty of the executors of the will who in this case are the personal representatives of the deceased to ensure that they nominate those entitled to the shares under the will as those to whom the shares should be transferred to. (section 155 (3) of CAMA).

Any person claiming to have an interest in any shares or the dividends or interest on those shares may protect his interest by swearing to an affidavit indicating the nature of his interest and serving the company with the affidavit.  The company shall then enter on the register of members the fact that such notice has been served on the company.  The company shall therefore not register any transfer of shares of the deceased in respect of which it had received the affidavit of interest. 
Any company which receives this notice of interest and in default proceeds to register any transfer in favor of any other person shall be personally liable to the person who lodged the notice of interest for any loss he suffers thereby.  (Section 156 of CAMA) 
The Company shall give notice of at least 42 days to any other person seeking a transfer to him, of the shares complained of, for the matter to be resolved otherwise, the proposed transfer will not be effected. section 156 (2)CAMA.
 
''Ownership'': on registration of the transmission of shares, the person entitled to transmission of shares becomes the shareholder of the company and is entitled to all rights and subject to all liabilities as such shareholder.

''Method'': while transfer of shares is brought about by delivery of a proper instrument of transfer (viz, [[transfer deed]]) duly stamped and executed, transmission of shares is done by forwarding the necessary documents (such as a notarised copy of death certificate) to the company.

==Legal process==
In the case of death, the surviving shareholders have to submit a request letter supported by an attested copy of the death certificate of the deceased shareholder and the relevant share certificates. The company’s registrar and share transfer agent on receipt of the said documents will delete the name of deceased shareholder from its records and return the share certificates to the applicant/registered holder with necessary endorsement.

{{Refimprove|date=February 2011}}
'''Social marketing intelligence''' is the method of extrapolating valuable information from [[social network]] interactions and [[big data|data]] flows that can enable companies to [[product launch|launch new products]] and services into the market at greater speed and lower cost. This is an area of research however, companies using social marketing intelligence have achieved significant improvement in marketing campaigns.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

Through social marketing intelligence, companies can identify people that are the most influential within their communities. These are the most connected people within any given social network. These people, sometimes called the ''alpha users'' or ''hubs'' as in [[small-world network]] theory, have considerable influence over the spread of information within their social network.&lt;ref name=xtract&gt;http://www.xtract.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alpha users==

Alpha users are key elements of any social networks, who manage the connectivity of the core members of the community. Similar to how viruses spread in nature, there is an initial starting point to communications in social networks, and the originators of such communications are alpha users. They tend to be highly connected users with exceptional influence to the other thought-leaders of any social network.

Before [[digital communications]], it was only possible to isolate the most influential members of any community by interviewing every member and tracing their full communication patterns within the social network. Traditional fixed [[landline telephone]] and [[internet]] use did not give enough accuracy to be able to pinpoint alpha users to a meaningful degree. With the advent of mobile phones, a personal digital communication channel was available to study. Early research by mathematicians at Xtract&lt;ref name=xtract/&gt; in [[Finland]] produced models that suggested mobile networks could indeed track the full communication and isolate the alpha users. Since then, several companies including Xtract have launched commercial tools to detect alpha users, usually using mobile operator billing and telecoms traffic data.

[[Engagement marketing]] campaigns attempt to use alpha users as spokespersons in marketing and advertising. The idea is that consumers will trust more the opinion of their friend or known contact from a social network, than the random marketing and advertising messages of companies and brands. The desire is to achieve [[viral marketing]] effects by which the alpha users would spread the messages further.

Alpha users were first briefly discussed in public in the book ''3G Marketing'' in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;''3G Marketing'', Ahonen, Kasper &amp; Melkko, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The first industry article about alpha users was by Ahonen and Ahvenainen in Total Telecom in February 2005. The first telecoms conference where ''alpha user'' was explained was the 3G Mobile World Congress in Tokyo in January 2005. The topic was part of the strategy keynote address at the 3GSM World Congress in Cannes in February 2005. The first book to discuss alpha users at length was ''Communities Dominate Brands'' in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;''Communities Dominate Brands'', Ahonen &amp; Moore, Futuretext, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''station master''' (or '''stationmaster''') is the person in charge of a [[Train station|railway station]], particularly in the [[United Kingdom]] and many other countries outside North America. In the United Kingdom, where the term originated, it is now largely historical&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scotroots.com/occupations.htm| title=Old Occupations in Scotland| work=Scot Roots}}&lt;/ref&gt; or colloquial, with the contemporary term being '''station manager'''. However, the term ''station master'' remains current on many [[heritage railway]]s, and also in many countries outside the United Kingdom, notably the extensive [[Indian Railways]] network.

Historically a male occupation, women were sometimes appointed to the position, and the gender variation ''station mistress'' was sometimes employed in such cases. In the United States the role is commonly termed '''station agent'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jobaps.com/SF/specs/classspecdisplay.asp?ClassNumber=9131 |title=Station Agent, Municipal Railway (#9131) |publisher=San Francisco Department of Human Resources |date=15 January 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Job description==
The station master is responsible for the management of other station [[Employment|employees]] and holds responsibility for safety and the efficient running of the station. The term was historically employed across stations of all sizes, leading to variation in the precise role. At a major city terminus, with potentially hundreds of employees, the station master's duties would focus on personnel management and public relations. At smaller town and country stations, with a more limited staff, the station master would have far more customer interaction with travelling passengers, and would commonly deputise for other members of staff in their absence.

On the contemporary British rail network a station manager at a major station has duties very similar to those described above. The more localised role of station master at small country stations no longer exists, with group station managers taking responsibility for two or more stations. In very rural areas a station manager may be responsible for a large number of stations, or even for all the stations on a local [[branch line]].

==Deputies and staff==
[[File:Restored station master's office, Norchard Station - geograph.org.uk - 896957.jpg|thumb|Station master's office at [[Norchard railway station]]]]
Historically, the station master was deputised (in his absence) by an ''Assistant Station Master'' (ASM). In large stations this might be a full-time position. In smaller local stations the ASM title was often attached to another post, such as senior booking clerk, or even head porter. On heritage railways the ASM role is often unchanged from this historic role. The ASM post also continues in many Commonwealth nations, and other countries which have experienced British influence.&lt;ref&gt;Assistant Station Master (ASM) role description at [http://www.indianrailwayemployee.com/content/job-profile-assistant-station-master-asm Indian Railways].&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary British railway operations the station manager is commonly deputised by one or more ''shift station managers''.&lt;ref&gt;Role outlined at [https://www.networkrail.co.uk/careers/working-in-a-major-station/ Network Rail] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of other employees at a railway station varies according to size. A historic station master would typically manage a number of booking clerks (responsible for ticket sales and financial auditing), [[Porter (railroad)|porters]] (responsible for platform safety, luggage transportation, and cleaning), and often ancillary staff in catering, left luggage, and maintenance roles. Although technically part of the engineering department, a station master might also have day-to-day management of [[Signalman (rail)|signalmen]] in the station's [[signal box]].

==Social position==
[[File:Former Station Masters Residence at Narrandera.jpg|thumb|The former station master's house at [[Narrandera]], Australia]]
From the late [[Victorian era]] onwards, station masters became prominent figures in local communities. Invariably they would be provided with a substantial [[house]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.transportarchive.org.uk/getobject.php?rnum=L1335&amp;searchitem=&amp;mtv=&amp;pnum=| title=Woodford Station Master's house| work=The Transport Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in [[rural]] [[Community|communities]] particularly, would have significant [[Social stratification|social standing]].&lt;ref name=scotby&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scotbystation.co.uk/scotby_station/history.htm| title=The history of Scotby Station}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The uniforms worn by station masters, whilst varying widely between different railway companies, often incorporated gold braid embroidery, and peaked caps with gold banding, giving the office-holder a high profile in the community. With his uniform, official housing, and public prominence, the station master was respected and widely attributed with seniority in the local community.&lt;ref&gt;See details, including examples, at [http://blog.nrm.org.uk/100-years-of-station-master-memories/ 100 years of Station Master memories], National Railway Museum, England.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some station masters achieved legendary fame in their communities. The late James Miller, long-serving station master at [[Oxford railway station]], received widespread recognition for his devoted service in the post, including civic decoration, a public-subscription retirement gift, the award of the [[British Empire Medal]], and the naming of a carriage siding after him.&lt;ref&gt;Illustrated full account from the [http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/community/memorylane/14619525.Popular_and_efficient_stationmaster_devoted_working_life_to_the_railway/ Oxford Mail] newspaper.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Beeching Axe|Beeching cuts]] of the 1960s many small stations were closed and the station master's house, along with other railway property, sold off. Typically, these buildings retained their original name and in many communities the ''Station Master's House'' can still be found as a private [[dwelling]]&lt;ref name="scotby"/&gt; or converted into a [[restaurant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.kentrail.org.uk/meopham.htm| title=Meopham| work=Kent Rail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In current Indian society station masters continue to enjoy a high social standing{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}, and there is considerable competition for vacancies. Indian Railways staff who have attained the grade of assistant station master (ASM), or station master (including regional station managers), have their own professional body or trade union, the [[All India Station Masters' Association]].

'''''The Yes Men''''', is a 2003 documentary film about the early [[culture jamming]] exploits of [[The Yes Men]]. 

The film revolves around "The Yes Men"—two [[anti-globalization]] activists, under the [[Pseudonym|alias]]es [[Jacques Servin|Andy Bichlbaum]] and [[Igor Vamos|Mike Bonanno]] — who impersonate spokespeople for the [[WTO]] and affiliated corporations, in order to secretly [[wikt:Special:Search/lampoon|lampoon]] and [[satirize]] these organizations with elaborate ruses and fraudulent announcements of ridiculous corporate decisions, in front of live, unsuspecting audiences (usually comprising businesspeople, university student bodies, and/or the [[news media|press]]). The film details the two activists' involvement in hoaxes targeting [[SimCopter]], the [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2000|2000 G. W. Bush presidential campaign]], [[McDonald's]], and, most prominently, the [[WTO]]. The film also includes brief interviews with [[Michael Moore]] and [[Greg Palast]].

The film premiered at the 28th Toronto International Film Festival in 2003. It was also shown as part of a special screening at the 2004 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film received a score of 85% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. It is followed by a sequel, ''[[The Yes Men Fix the World]]''.

'''William Cunninghame of Lainshaw''' (1731–1799) was a Scottish  [[tobacco]] merchant who, along with a handful of others in 18th century [[Glasgow]], came to dominate and profit from the transatlantic trade. He made a fortune stockpiling cheap tobacco shortly before the [[American Revolution]], assuming that Great Britain would not be able to retain control over her rebellious colonies, and then selling at high prices. Cunninghame's (much altered and expanded) neo-classical house on Glasgow's Queen Street today houses the collection of the [[Gallery of Modern Art, Glasgow|Gallery of Modern Art]].

==Early life==
Cunninghame was born in 1715  &lt;ref&gt;Oliver, p.334&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Kilmarnock]], [[Ayrshire]], into a prosperous merchant family. He was a blood relative of [[Andrew Cochrane of Brighouse]] (1693-1777), who was one of Glasgow's most respected Lord Provosts. Family ties were of great importance in helping to build Cunninghame's growing fortune.&lt;ref name="GlasgowStory"&gt;[http://www.theglasgowstory.com/story.php?id=TGSBH08 The Glasgow Story] Retrieved June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Wfm goma glasgow.jpg|thumb|William Cunninghame's neo-classical mansion on Queens St, Glasgow, built in 1780 at a cost of £10,000]]
Cunninghame first sailed to America in 1746 as a young apprentice in the firm of Cochrane, Murdoch &amp; Company. After four years of training he was promoted to become a manager and in 1752 he came to oversee all the company business in [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name="GlasgowStory"/&gt;

In 1762 he returned to Scotland, where he became the principal partner in the firm of Cochrane, Murdoch &amp; Co. By the early 1770s he changed the company name to William Cunninghame &amp; Company, and it grew to become one of the city's five largest importers.&lt;ref name="GlasgowStory"/&gt;

Twice a year his flagship - modestly named ''The Cunninghame'' - arrived in the [[Chesapeake Bay]], loaded with European luxury goods such as silverware and furniture, and ready to collect Tobacco for export back to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, p.341&lt;/ref&gt; Cunninghame, like the other Glasgow merchants, extended credit to the growers enabling them to buy goods from the company store before their tobacco was sold at market. However, many growers found themselves deeply in debt and thereby forced to accept low prices for their crop. Cunningham was known to offer prices as much as 10% below market value to distressed growers.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, p.342&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Revolution==
Cunninghame made an even greater fortune from the tobacco scarcity caused by the [[American War of Independence]].&lt;ref name="GlasgowStory"/&gt; On the outbreak of war, Cunningham's business partners found themselves in possession of substantial stocks of tobacco which they had purchased for around three pence per pound. As war began to disrupt the trade the price rose, and Cunningham’s partners, confident that the rebellious colonists would soon be defeated, sold out their stock at sixpence per pound. Cunningham took the opposite view and he personally purchased their entire stock. Eventually, as the long war disrupted supplies, the price of tobacco rose to a staggering 3 shillings and sixpence, making a huge fortune for Cunninghame.&lt;ref name="REH"&gt;[http://www.amostcuriousmurder.com/RoyalExchangeHistory.htm Royal Exchange History] Retrieved June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many wealthy Glasgow merchants, Cunninghame used his profits to buy a country estate.&lt;ref name="REH"/&gt; In 1778 he purchased for £26,200 for the estate of [[Lands of Lainshaw|Lainshaw]], in [[Ayrshire]].&lt;ref name="GlasgowStory"/&gt; He also purchased a property in the Cow Loan in Glasgow, which he renamed Queen Street after the wife of George III, and in 1780 he built there a large mansion in the neo-classical style at a cost of £10,000, an immense sum at the time.&lt;ref name="REH"/&gt;

In 1779 he completed his rise to the wealthy landed gentry by registering his family coat-of-arms at the office of the Lord Lyon in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="GlasgowStory"/&gt; In 1780 Cunninghame retired from the tobacco business, although he was not yet fifty years old.&lt;ref name="GlasgowStory"/&gt;

==Family life==
Cunninghame married three times and had fourteen children. He disinherited his eldest sons Thomas and Alexander and it was his third son [[William Cuninghame of Lainshaw|William Cunninghame]] who eventually inherited the estate in 1799.&lt;ref name="P588"&gt;Paterson, Page 588&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Today Cunninghame's neo classical palace on Glasgow's Queen Street houses the collection of the [[Gallery of Modern Art, Glasgow|Gallery of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="GlasgowStory"/&gt;
