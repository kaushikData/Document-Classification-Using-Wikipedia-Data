== Early life ==
Kelly was born in Manhattan's [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood. His mother died during childbirth and his father died before he was born. He ran away and went to sea at the age of 13, and changed his name to Alvin. In his early years he worked as a [[steelworker]], [[steeplejack]], [[high diver]], boxer and [[Body double|movie double]]. He was also a [[Pilot licensing and certification|licensed pilot]] who performed [[Stunt pilot|aerial stunts]].&lt;ref name="Sarasota" /&gt; He served as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the U.S. [[Merchant Marine Reserve|Naval Auxiliary Reserve]] during [[World War I]], serving from May 1918 to September 1921.&lt;ref name="Burial record"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes -death" /&gt; During the war he served on the [[USS Edgar F.

== Career ==
According to one account,Kelly climbed his first pole at the age of seven, and at nine he performed a "[[Velcro jumping|human fly]]" trick, climbing up the side of a building.&lt;ref name="Sarasota" /&gt; He is credited with popularizing the pole-sitting fad after sitting atop a flagpole in 1924, either in response to a dare from a friend &lt;ref&gt;Long, Mark A., and Jim Fee. ''Bad Fads.'' Toronto: ECW, 2002. p. 17 ''Ebrary.''  Web. 22 December  2011.&lt;/ref&gt; or as a publicity stunt to draw customers to a [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] department store.&lt;ref name="Pole position"&gt;Baker, Danny. "Shipwreck for ever in pole position." ''The Times'' (United Kingdom) 21 August  2002: ''Newspaper Source Plus.'' Web. 22 December  2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In January of that year he sat on a pole for 13 hours and 13 minutes to publicize a movie.&lt;ref name="Sarasota" /&gt;

In 1926, Kelly set a record by sitting atop a flagpole in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] for seven days and one hour; in June 1927, he planned to beat that record by sitting for eight days in [[Newark, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="Rooster"&gt;"Flagpole Rooster". ''Time'' 9.25 (20 June  1927): 12. ''Academic Search Premier.'' Web. 22 December  2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  He would end up sitting atop the Newark pole for twelve days,&lt;ref name="Twelve"&gt;"Twelve Days". ''Time.'' 9.26 (27 June  1927): 11. ''Academic Search Premier.'' Web. 22 December  2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and on a pole in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]'s [[Carlin's Park]] for 23 days in 1929.&lt;ref name="Sarasota" /&gt; In 1930 he set a world record by sitting on a flagpole on top of the [[Steel Pier]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], {{convert|225|ft}} high, for 49 days and one hour.&lt;ref name="Maeder - 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vUoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=shipwreck+kelly|title = Ozzie &amp; Shipwreck|last = |first = |date = 4 October 1948|work = LIFE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of his fame as a latter-day [[stylite]], he toured 28 cities, charging admission to people who wanted to stand on roofs to see his performance stunts. He also earned an income from [[Testimonial|endorsements]], personal appearances and books about his life. He called himself "the luckiest fool in the world." He once calculated that over two decades he spent 20,613 hours sitting on flagpoles, of which 210 were in sub-freezing weather and 1400 hours in the rain.&lt;ref name="NYTimes -death" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maeder - 1999" /&gt; In one 1927 stunt, he climbed on a pole on a speeding [[biplane]], sitting on a {{convert|12|in|cm|spell=in|adj=on}} iron [[:wikt:crossbar|crossbar]] as the plane flew {{convert|500|ft}} high. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that "he didn't get around to hanging by one hand, as he promised he would."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1927/11/11/94918572.pdf|title = Climbs a Flagpole on Speeding Airplane|last = |first = |date = 11 November 1927|work = The New York Times|accessdate = 14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While pole sitting, Kelly was said to have subsisted mainly on [[coffee]] and [[cigarette]]s. He learned how to nap while sitting upright, and never was secured by more than a simple leg strap. He once claimed that he doesn't "take as many chances as a [[window cleaner]]." Journalist Jay Maeder wrote that "The newspapers were regularly full of pictures of Shipwreck Kelly, matter-of-factly brushing his teeth and shaving his face, hundreds of feet in the air."&lt;ref name="Maeder - 1999" /&gt; He said that he was able to sleep while pole sitting by putting his thumbs in holes in the pole shafts. If he swayed, the pain in his thumbs would force him to right himself without waking him up.&lt;ref name="NYTimes -death" /&gt;

His career began to decline after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], and in 1934 he was working as a [[gigolo]] at a [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] dance hall, [[Roseland Ballroom|Roseland]], then a [[Taxi dance hall|"dime a dance" hall]]. Journalist [[H. Allen Smith]] found him "wearing a [[tail coat]] and [[silk]] hat, sitting on a [[plush]] [[Divan (furniture)|divan]]." By then, Kelly said, 17 people were claiming to be him, because few people knew what he looked like.&lt;ref name="Smith - 1934"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=H. Allen|authorlink1=H. Allen Smith|title=Shipwreck Kelly Tells All, Admits He's Just a Gigolo|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19340203&amp;id=848cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=v44EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2423,844546|accessdate=14 December 2014|work=The Pittsburgh Press|agency=United Press|date=3 February 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s there was less tolerance for such stunts, and police took a dim view of the disruption it caused. In 1935 he attempted to break his Atlantic City record by sitting on a pole in the [[Bronx]], but was aloft for less than a day before he was arrested as a public nuisance. He only climbed down from the pole after police threatened to cut it down.&lt;ref name="NYTimes -death" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maeder - 1999" /&gt;

One of his last major public appearances was on October 13, 1939: Kelly celebrated National Donut Dunking Week by sitting on a pole atop the [[Chanin Building]] on East [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] in Manhattan and eating 13 donuts dunked into a coffee cup and fed to him while he stood on his head.&lt;ref name="Timeless"&gt;Romero, Librado. "Timeless". ''New York Times'' 29 September  2010: 24. ''Newspaper Source Plus.'' Web. 22 December  2011.&lt;/ref&gt; But by then that kind of work had pretty much dried up, He served in the [[United States Merchant Marine]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Maeder - 1999" /&gt;

Accounts vary as to how Kelly acquired his nickname.  He claimed to have survived during his lifetime five [[shipwreck]]s, two airplane and three automobile accidents, and one train wreck, all without injury.&lt;ref name="NYTimes -death" /&gt; His wife told reporters that he was a survivor of the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the RMS ''Titanic'']].&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt; However, there were only three ''Titanic'' survivors named Kelly and all were women, and "there is no reason to believe that he ever came near the ''Titanic''."&lt;ref name="Titanic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Titanic Survivors|url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivors/|website=Encyclopedia Titanica|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maeder - 1999"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maeder|first1=Jay|title=The Guy in the Sky Shipwreck Kelly|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/guy-sky-shipwreck-kelly-article-1.850977|accessdate=14 December 2014|work=The Daily News|date=19 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also said to have gained the nickname as a boxer,&lt;ref name="Sarasota" /&gt; because "he was so often adrift in the ring that the handle became inevitable."&lt;ref name="Pole position" /&gt;

He was described in a 1939 article as a "stocky, blue-eyed, battered little Irishman" with "sparse red hair."&lt;ref name="Spokesman Review 1939"&gt;{{cite news|title=Flagpole Champ Home for Game|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19391229&amp;id=WChWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9uMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6831,4428016|accessdate=14 December 2014|work=The Spokesman-Review|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly's last flagpole-sitting appearance was at an [[Orange, Texas]] event sponsored by the [[Lion's Club]] on October 4, 1952, one week before his death. Two [[heart attack]]s forced him to come down from the 65-foot pole, and the club refused to let him go back up. He retired as a result of the heart attacks, saying "This is it.

==Personal life==
Kelly married an elevator operator, Frances Vivian Steele of Dallas, Texas,&lt;ref name="NYTimes -death" /&gt; whom he met while pole sitting.&lt;ref name="Sarasota" /&gt; They had a son, Alvin Kieran Kelly,&lt;ref name="NYTimes -death" /&gt; who became a laborer for the [[Clyde Beatty Circus]]. In June 1973, the son was killed at the age of 45 by an elephant during a performance in [[Tenafly, New Jersey]].

==Death==

At the time of his death in October 1952, Kelly had become a "grizzled old man" – penniless and all but forgotten. He was by then a widower who had been on [[General Assistance|home relief]] for six months, and his son was in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] overseas. He had been suffering from an [[cardiac asthma|asthmatic heart]] and [[Atherosclerosis|hardening of the arteries]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes -death" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Toledo" /&gt;

Kelly died on October 11, 1952 when he was struck by a car while walking on [[Manhattan]]'s West [[51st Street (Manhattan)|51st Street]],&lt;ref name="NYTimes -death" /&gt; near the [[boarding house|rooming house]] where he lived and not far from his birthplace.&lt;ref name=alvin&gt;Rasmussen, Frederick M.

'''Benjamin Ernest "Ben" Linder''' (July 7, 1959 – April 28, 1987), was an [[United States|American]] engineer. While working on a small [[hydroelectric dam]] in rural northern [[Nicaragua]] Linder was killed by the [[Contras]], a loose confederation of rebel groups funded by the U.S. government. Coming at a time when U.S. support for the Contras was already highly controversial, Linder's death made front-page headlines around the world and further polarized opinion in the United States.

==Biography==
The [[California]]-born Linder graduated from [[Adams High School (Portland, Oregon)|Adams High School]] in [[Portland, Oregon]] in 1977. While in College at the [[University of Washington]], Linder enjoyed [[juggling]] and was often seen around [[Seattle]] riding a {{convert|5|to|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} [[unicycle]]. He graduated in 1983, with a degree in [[mechanical engineering]]. He left his Oregon home that summer and moved to [[Managua]], the capital of Nicaragua.

Linder felt inspired by the 1979 [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] revolution, and wanted to support its efforts to improve the lives of the country's poorest people. The [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], however, saw the Sandinistas as a beachhead of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Communism]] in the [[Western Hemisphere]], and was determined to cripple the revolution. Beginning in 1981, the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] secretly trained, armed and supplied thousands of [[Contras|Contra]] rebels. A major element of the Contras' strategy was to launch attacks on government cooperatives, health clinics and power stations — the very things that most exemplified the improvements that had been brought about by the revolution.

In 1986, Linder moved from Managua to [[El Cuá]], a village in the Nicaraguan war zone, where he helped form a team to build a hydroelectric plant to bring electricity to the town. While living in El Cuá, he participated in vaccination campaigns, using his talents as a clown, juggler, and unicyclist to entertain the local children, for whom he expressed great affection and concern.

On 28 April 1987, Linder and two Nicaraguans were killed in a Contra ambush while traveling through the forest to scout out a construction site for a new dam for the nearby village of [[San José de Bocay]]. The [[autopsy]] showed that Linder had been wounded by a [[grenade]], then shot at point-blank range in the head. The two Nicaraguans — Sergio Hernández and Pablo Rosales — were also killed at close range. Linder was posthumously awarded the [[Courage of Conscience award]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peaceabbey.org/awards/cocrecipientlist.html The Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Recipients List] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207195509/http://www.peaceabbey.org/awards/cocrecipientlist.html |date=February 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on September 26, 1992.

==Controversy==
Linder's death quickly inflamed the already-polarized debate inside the United States, with opponents of U.S. policy decrying the use of taxpayers' dollars to finance the killing of an American citizen as well as thousands of Nicaraguan civilians.

The administration fought back, with [[White House]] spokesman [[Marlin Fitzwater]] quoted in ''[[The New York Times]]'' as saying that U.S. citizens working in Nicaragua had "put themselves in harm's way". [[Assistant Secretary of State]] [[Elliott Abrams]], an ardent proponent of the Contra War, echoed that view, saying that Linder should have known better than to be in a combat zone.

Linder's mother Elisabeth, in Nicaragua for her son's funeral, said, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;My son was brutally murdered for bringing electricity to a few poor people in northern Nicaragua. He was murdered because he had a dream and because he had the courage to make that dream come true. ... Ben told me the first year that he was here, and this is a quote, "It's a wonderful feeling to work in a country where the government's first concern is for its people, for all of its people."&lt;ref&gt;Gary Handschumacher, "Mourn Ben Linder, Not His Killer: Ronald Reagan's Death Squads," ''Counterpunch,'' June 16, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During a Congressional hearing in May 1987, some defenders of U.S. policy in Nicaragua responded, launching personal attacks on Linder's family and other witnesses. The ''[[Village Voice]]'' reported one exchange between [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[Connie Mack III|Connie Mack]] of [[Florida]] and Elisabeth Linder, who had just given emotional testimony about her son's work and motivations. Mack accused Mrs. Linder of using her grief "to politicize this situation", adding, ''"I don't want to be tough on you, but I really feel you have asked for it."'' &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/15/opinion/abroad-at-home-the-most-cruel.html ABROAD AT HOME; 'The Most Cruel'] By Anthony Lewis, May 15, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of Linder, coming as Congressional hearings investigated the [[Iran-Contra Affair]], fueled the debate in the U.S. over the covert war in Nicaragua. The next year, Congress refused to renew aid to the Contras. But the civil war, conscription into the army, the collapse of the economy, and the curtailment of [[civil liberties]] in the mid-1980s all combined to cause the defeat of the [[FSLN]] government in February 1990 elections.

In July 1996, American journalist [[Paul Berman]] published an article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' featuring an interview with a man who claimed to have killed Linder.&lt;ref&gt;See: Paul Berman, "In Search of Ben Linder's Killers," ''The New Yorker,'' vol. 72, no. 28 (Sept. 23, 1996), pp. 58-??.&lt;/ref&gt; Linder's parents and their lawyers publicly denounced the article and disputed the veracity of the man Berman interviewed. In 2001 journalist [[Joan Kruckewitt]], who lived in Nicaragua from 1983 to 1991 and covered the war between the Sandinistas and the Contras for [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]], wrote a book entitled ''The Death of Ben Linder'' giving a more sympathetic portrait of Linder's life, work, and death.&lt;ref&gt;See: Joan Kruckewitt, ''The Death of Ben Linder.'' Seven Stories Press 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "[[Fragile (song)|Fragile]]" on [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]'s 1987 album, ''[[...Nothing Like the Sun]]'', is a tribute to Ben Linder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sting.com/discography/index/album/albumId/194/tagName/studio_albums "Sting: Fragile CD,"] www.sting.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Singer-songwriter Dean Stevens wrote and recorded "The Children Knew Ben" on his 1989 CD, Seeds, for Volcano Records. The 1990 book ''[[Animal Dreams]]'' by [[Barbara Kingsolver]] is also dedicated to his memory, as was the (now closed) Ben Linder Cafe in [[Leon, Nicaragua]], which was adorned with his photo and memories of his life's work.

'''Beverley Gail Allitt''' (born 4 October 1968) is an [[England|English]] [[serial killer|serial child killer]] who was convicted of murdering four children, attempting to murder three other children, and causing [[grievous bodily harm]] to a further six.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=The verdicts: Beverley Allitt | last=Katz | first=Ian | work=[[The Guardian]] | location=London| date=18 May 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crimes were committed over a period of 59 days between February and April 1991 in the children's ward at [[Grantham and Kesteven Hospital]], [[Lincolnshire]], where Allitt was employed as a [[Licensed practical nurse#United Kingdom|State Enrolled Nurse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Nurse 'only link to children's deaths' | work=[[The Guardian]] | location=London| date=16 February 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Shadows of death fell across Ward 4 | last=Jenkins | first=Lin | work=[[The Times]] | location=London | date=18 May 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Killings fed a craving for attention | last=Jenkins | first=Lin | work=[[The Times]] | location=London | date=18 May 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; She administered large doses of [[insulin]] to at least two victims and a large [[air embolism|air bubble]] was found in the body of another, but police were unable to establish how all the attacks were carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Child murderer confesses at last | last=Foster | first=Jonathan | work=[[The Independent]] | location=London | date=15 October 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1993, at [[Nottingham Crown Court]], she received thirteen [[Life imprisonment|life sentences]] for the crimes.

==Early life==
Beverley Allitt was born on 4 October 1968 and grew up in the village of [[Corby Glen]], near the town of [[Grantham]]. She had two sisters and a brother. Her father, Richard, worked in an [[off-licence]], and her mother as a school cleaner. Allitt attended [[Charles Read Academy|Charles Read Secondary Modern School]], having failed the test to enter [[Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School]].

==Victims==

===Died===
*Liam Taylor (seven weeks old) – was admitted to the ward for a chest infection and was murdered on 21 February 1991.
*Timothy Hardwick (eleven years old) – a boy with [[cerebral palsy]] who was admitted to the ward after having an [[epileptic seizure]]. He was murdered on 5 March 1991.
*Becky Phillips (two months old) – admitted to the ward for [[gastroenteritis]] on 1 April 1991. She was administered an [[insulin]] overdose by Allitt and died at home two days later; her death was originally believed to have been [[cot death]].
*Claire Peck (fifteen months old) – admitted to the ward following an [[asthma attack]] on 22 April 1991. After being put on a [[ventilator]], she was left alone in Allitt's care for a short interval during which time she went into [[cardiac arrest]]. She was resuscitated but died after a second episode of cardiac arrest, again following a period when she was left alone with Allitt.

===Survived===
*Kayley Desmond (then one year old) – admitted to the ward for a chest infection. Allitt attempted to murder her on 8 March 1991 but the child was resuscitated and transferred to another hospital, where she recovered.
*Paul Crampton (then five months old) – admitted to the ward for a chest infection on 20 March 1991. Allitt attempted to murder him with an insulin overdose on three occasions the day before he was transferred to another hospital, where he recovered.
*Bradley Gibson (then five years old) – admitted to the ward for [[pneumonia]]. He suffered two cardiac arrests on 21 March 1991, due to Allitt administering insulin overdoses, before he was transferred to another hospital, where he recovered.
* Michael Davidson (then six years old) – admitted to the ward for [[Surgery#Post-operative care|post-operative care]] following an operation to remove an [[air rifle]] pellet that he had been injured with in an accident. After being injected with insulin multiple times through a [[cannula]] on his hand, he suffered from [[cyanosis]] and fell unconscious before being stabilised by other doctors on the ward. He later made a full recovery.
*Yik Hung Chan (also known as Henry, then two years old) – admitted to the ward following a fall on 21 March 1991. He suffered an oxygen desaturation attack before he was transferred to another hospital, where he recovered.
*Katie Phillips (then two months old) – Becky's twin was admitted to the ward as a precaution following the death of her sister. She had to be resuscitated twice after unexplained [[apnoeic]] episodes (which were later found to be caused by insulin and [[potassium]] overdoses). Following the second time that she stopped breathing, she was transferred to another hospital but, by this time, had suffered permanent [[brain damage]], partial paralysis and partial blindness due to [[oxygen deprivation]]. Her parents had been so grateful for Allitt's care of Becky that they had asked her to be Katie's [[Godparent|godmother]]. In 1999 Katie was awarded £2.125 million, by Lincolnshire Health Authority, to pay for treatment and equipment for the rest of her life. Lincolnshire Health Authority did not accept liability, but did acknowledge that Katie was entitled to compensation.

==Trial and imprisonment==
Allitt had attacked thirteen children, four fatally, over a 59-day period before she was brought up on charges for her crimes. It was only following the death of Peck that medical staff became suspicious of the number of cardiac arrests on the children's ward and police were called in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/308/6924/287 |title=Murder in the NHS |accessdate=6 February 2007 |date=29 January 1994 |publisher=W J Appleyard}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that Allitt was the only nurse on duty for all the attacks on the children and she also had access to the drugs.

Four of Allitt's victims had died. She was charged with four counts of murder, eleven counts of [[attempted murder]] and eleven counts of causing [[grievous bodily harm]]. Allitt entered pleas of not guilty to all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hospital nurse denies killing babies with insulin injections|last=Murray|first=Ian|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=16 February 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 May 1993 she was found guilty on each charge and sentenced to thirteen concurrent terms of life imprisonment, which she is serving at [[Rampton Secure Hospital]] in [[Nottinghamshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Behind the scenes at Rampton|last=Robinson|first=Oonagh|work=[[Nottingham Evening Post]]|location=Nottingham|date=28 November 2011|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/angels/beverly_allitt/6.html |title=Beverly Allitt: Suffer the Children |accessdate=6 February 2007 |date=10 May 2000 |publisher=[[The Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208092708/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/angels/beverly_allitt/6.html |archivedate=8 February 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 December 2007, Mr Justice [[Stanley Burnton]], sitting in the [[High Court of Justice]], [[London]], confirmed that Allitt must serve the original minimum sentence of thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serial killer nurse Allitt must serve 30 years|first=David|last=Batty|date=6 December 2007|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|accessdate=29 August 2013|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/dec/06/ukcrime.health}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that some families of Allitt's victims had previously mistakenly believed that her minimum [[tariff]] had been set at forty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=6 December 2007|title=Child killer Allitt's tariff set|work=[[BBC News]]|location=London|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lincolnshire/7130211.stm|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allitt's motives have never been fully explained. According to one theory, she showed symptoms of [[factitious disorder]], also known as Munchausen syndrome or [[Munchausen syndrome by proxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/famous_criminal/8/the_arrest/1/Beverley_Allitt.htm |title=Famous Criminals: Beverley Allitt |accessdate=6 February 2007 |date=10 February 2005 |publisher=Crime &amp; Investigation Network |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121201300/http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/famous_criminal/8/the_arrest/1/Beverley_Allitt.htm |archivedate=21 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This controversial disorder is described as involving a pattern of [[Child abuse|abuse]] in which a perpetrator ascribes to, or physically falsifies illnesses in, someone under their care to attract attention to themselves.

==In popular culture==
In 2005, the [[BBC]] made a dramatisation of the story, ''Angel of Death'', in which [[Charlie Brooks]] played Allitt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angel of Death: The Beverly Allitt Story|url=http://crimedocumentary.com/angel-death-beverly-allitt-story-2005/|website=crimedocumentary.com|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allitt's story was depicted in episodes of the [[true crime]] documentaries ''[[Crimes That Shook Great Britain]]'', ''Born To Kill?'', ''Evil Up Close'', and ''Nurses Who Kill''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/shows/evil-up-close/episode-guide/evil-up-close-series-1]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Patrick "Billy" Corgan Jr.''' (born March 17, 1967)&lt;ref name="allmusic-bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/billy-corgan-mn0000070026/biography|title=Billy Corgan Biography|first=Greg|last=Prato|publisher=[[AllMusic.com]]|accessdate=December 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American musician, songwriter, who is the lead singer, primary songwriter, guitarist, and sole permanent member of [[The Smashing Pumpkins]]. Formed by Corgan and guitarist [[James Iha]] in [[Chicago]], Illinois, in 1988, the band quickly gained steam with the addition of bassist [[D'arcy Wretzky]] and drummer [[Jimmy Chamberlin]]. Strong album sales and large-scale tours propelled the band's increasing fame in the [[1990s in music|1990s]] until their break-up in 2000. Corgan started a new band called [[Zwan]], and after their quick demise, he released a solo album ''[[TheFutureEmbrace]]'' in 2005 and a collection of poetry (''[[Blinking with Fists]]'') before setting his sights on reforming Smashing Pumpkins.

The new version of The Smashing Pumpkins, consisting of Corgan and [[List of The Smashing Pumpkins band members|a revolving lineup]], has released and toured new albums extensively since 2007. In October 2017, he released his first solo album in over a decade, ''[[Ogilala]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =https://www.npr.org/2017/10/05/554282861/first-listen-william-patrick-corgan-ogilala |title= Review: William Patrick Corgan, 'Ogilala'| publisher = npr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Corgan entered the world of professional wrestling, founding Chicago-based [[Resistance Pro Wrestling]]. He later joined [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (now known as [[Impact Wrestling]]) in 2015, becoming its president in August 2016. After leaving TNA in November 2016, Corgan purchased the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA), gaining its ownership in October 2017.

==Early life and career==

===1967–1987: Childhood and formative years===
William Patrick Corgan, Jr.  was born at Columbus Hospital in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood on March 17, 1967 as the oldest son of William Corgan Sr., a [[blues music|blues]]/rock guitarist, and Martha Louise Maes Corgan Lutz. He was raised Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lionsroar.com/qa-smashing-pumpkins-frontman-billy-corgan-talks-music-depression-adam-yauch-buddhism-and-christianity/|title=Q&amp;A: Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan talks music, depression, Adam Yauch, Buddhism, and...|last=Sperry|first=Rod Meade|date=2013-02-23|newspaper=Lion's Roar|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cookcountyclerk.com/sweethomecookcounty/documents/2007sweethome.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528132937/http://www.cookcountyclerk.com/sweethomecookcounty/documents/2007sweethome.pdf |archivedate=May 28, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents had one more son, Ricky, before divorcing in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Billy|last=Corgan|url=http://billycorgan.livejournal.com/2005/06/02/|title=The Confessions of Billy Corgan: The Toy Hammer|website=[[Livejournal]]|date=June 2, 2005|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091222214449/http://billycorgan.livejournal.com/2005/06/02/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 22, 2009|quote=William also fathered a half-brother, but Corgan has never found out who he is.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was soon remarried to a flight attendant, and Corgan and his brother went to live with them in [[Glendale Heights, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="suntimes_derogatis"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jim|last=DeRogatis|url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/entertainment/cst-ftr-dero30.html|title=Rock and Roll's Best and Worst Chicago Songs|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=July 30, 2003|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030803140156/http://www.suntimes.com/output/entertainment/cst-ftr-dero30.html|archivedate=August 3, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Corgan alleges that his stepmother [[physical abuse|physically]] and [[emotional abuse|emotionally abused]] him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Billy|last=Corgan|url=http://billycorgan.livejournal.com/2005/07/01/|title=The Confessions of Billy Corgan: Following the Moon|website=[[Livejournal]]|date=July 1, 2005|dead-url=yes|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091222214501/http://billycorgan.livejournal.com/2005/07/01/|archive-date=December 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corgan also developed a protective bond with his younger paternal half-brother, who had [[special needs]] as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Beth|last=Wilson|title=He's My Brother|publisher=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]|date=April 17, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Corgan's father and stepmother separated, all three boys would live alone with their stepmother, with both of Corgan's birth parents living separately within an hour's drive.&lt;ref name="howard"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rspaa.org/data/Interviews/000229%20-%20Howard%20Stern%20interview.mp3|title=Howard Stern interviews Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308043120/http://www.rspaa.org/data/Interviews/000229%20-%20Howard%20Stern%20interview.mp3|archivedate=March 8, 2012|date=February 29, 2000|author=Stern, Howard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corgan, who grew much faster than his fellow students, was a strong athlete in elementary school.&lt;ref name="limb"&gt;{{cite news|last=Blashill|first=Pat|title=Out on a Limb|publisher=[[Details Magazine]]|date=October 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being a member of his Marquardt Middle School baseball team, he collected [[baseball cards]] (amassing over 10,000) and listened to every [[Chicago Cubs]] game.&lt;ref name="limb"/&gt; However, by the time he began attending [[Glenbard North High School]] in [[Carol Stream, Illinois]], he had become only an average athlete. He decided to start playing guitar when he went over to a friend's house and saw his friend's [[Flying V]].&lt;ref name="limb"/&gt; Corgan gave his savings to his father, who bought him a used [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul]] knock-off.&lt;ref name="limb"/&gt; Corgan Sr. steered his son stylistically, encouraging him to listen to [[Jeff Beck]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]], but offered little other support, and the younger Corgan taught himself to play the instrument.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt; His musical interests in his formative years included [[hard rock]] like ''[[Guts (John Cale album)|Guts]]''-era [[John Cale]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] pioneers [[Black Sabbath]], and [[mainstream rock]] like [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Boston (band)|Boston]], [[Electric Light Orchestra|ELO]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], and [[Cheap Trick]]. In high school, Corgan discovered alternative rock through [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] and [[The Cure]].&lt;ref&gt;DeRogatis, pg. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

Corgan performed in a string of bands in high school, and graduated as an honor student. Despite grant and scholarship offers from a number of schools, and a tuition fund left by his grandmother,&lt;ref name="fricke"&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Fricke|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/smashingpumpkins/articles/story/5918770/smashing_pumpkins_look_back_in_wonder|title=Smashing Pumpkins Look Back in Wonder|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media LLC|location=New York City|date=December 22, 2000|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909113134/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/smashingpumpkins/articles/story/5918770/smashing_pumpkins_look_back_in_wonder|archivedate=September 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corgan decided to pursue music full-time.&lt;ref name="eddy"&gt;{{cite web|first=Billy|last=Corgan|url=http://billycorgan.livejournal.com/2005/04/15/|title=The Confessions of Billy Corgan: Eddy Street|website=[[Livejournal]]|date=April 15, 2005|dead-url=no|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091222215217/http://billycorgan.livejournal.com/2005/04/15/|archive-date=December 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not finding the Chicago music scene to his liking, he moved from Chicago to [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] in 1985 with his first major band, The Marked (so named for the conspicuous birthmarks of both Corgan and drummer Ron Roesing). Not finding success in St. Petersburg, the band dissolved; Corgan moved back to Chicago to live with his father.

Corgan performed with [[Wayne Static]] in Static's first band, Deep Blue Dream, in 1987/88.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|first=Billy|last=Corgan|user=Billy|url=https://twitter.com/Billy/status/528893858885926913|title=I am shocked to hear that Wayne Wells (Wayne Static) has passed away.

===1988–2000: The Smashing Pumpkins===
{{Main|The Smashing Pumpkins}}

{{BLP sources section|date=November 2014}}

Upon his return to Chicago, Corgan had already devised his next project – a band that would be called The Smashing Pumpkins.&lt;ref name="view"&gt;Corgan, Billy. Interview. ''[[Vieuphoria]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Corgan met guitarist [[James Iha]] while working in a record store, and the two began recording demos, which Corgan describes as "gloomy little [[goth]]-pop records."&lt;ref name="view"/&gt; He then met bassist [[D'arcy Wretzky]] after a local show, arguing with her about a band that had just played, [[The Dan Reed Network]]. Soon after, the Smashing Pumpkins were formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/smashing-pumpkins/biography |title= Smashing Pumpkins Bio | publisher = rollingstone.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trio began to play together at local clubs with only a [[drum machine]] for percussion. To secure a show at the [[Cabaret Metro|Metro]] in Chicago, the band recruited drummer [[Jimmy Chamberlin]], and played for the first time as a quartet on October 5, 1988.

[[File:Billy Corgan in 1992.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Billy Corgan in 1992]]
The addition of Chamberlin drove the band in a heavier direction almost immediately.&lt;ref name="view"/&gt; On the band's inaugural album, ''[[Gish]]'' (1991), the band integrated [[psychedelic rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] into their sound. ''Gish'' fared better than expected, but the follow-up, ''[[Siamese Dream]]'', released on [[Virgin Records]] in 1993, became a multi-platinum hit. The band became known for internal drama during this period, with Corgan frequently characterized in the music press as a "[[control freak]]" due to rumors that Corgan played all the guitar and bass parts on ''Siamese Dream'' (a rumor that Corgan later confirmed as true). Despite this, the album was well received by critics, and the songs "[[Today (The Smashing Pumpkins song)|Today]]," "[[Cherub Rock]], and "[[Disarm]]" became smash hits.

The band's 1995 follow up effort, the double album ''[[Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness]]'', was even more successful, spawning a string of hit singles. According to Jon Pareles from ''[[The New York Times]]'', Corgan wanted to "lose himself and find himself..." in this album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Jon|last1=Pareles|title=Alternative Rockers Think Big, Uneasily.|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=October 22, 1995|pages=2.38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was nominated for seven [[Grammy awards]] that year, and would eventually be certified ten times platinum in the United States. The song "[[1979 (song)|1979]]" was Corgan's biggest hit to date, reaching No. 1 on [[Billboard magazine|''Billboard'']]'s modern rock and mainstream rock charts. Their appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on November 11, 1995, to promote this material (their second appearance on the show overall) was also the television debut appearance of Corgan's shaved head, which he has maintained consistently ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mac|first1=Ryan|last2=Dunn|first2=Charlie|title=Review: Live 105’s Not So Silent Night|url=http://www.stanforddaily.com/2010/12/14/review-live-105s-not-so-silent-night/|accessdate=November 25, 2014|work=[[The Stanford Daily]]|date=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 1996, touring keyboardist [[Jonathan Melvoin]] died in a Manhattan hotel room of a [[heroin]] overdose after he and Chamberlin used the drug together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Neil|last=Strauss|url =https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/13/nyregion/musician-for-smashing-pumpkins-dies-of-apparent-drug-overdose.html |title= Musician for Smashing Pumpkins Dies of Apparent Drug Overdose | newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=July 13, 1996|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chamberlin was later arrested on a misdemeanor drug possession charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/501610/MUSICIAN-DIES-AFTER-APPARENT-DRUG-OVERDOSE.html|title=MUSICIAN DIES AFTER APPARENT DRUG OVERDOSE|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=Deseret News Publishing Company|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|date=July 13, 1996|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Smashing Pumpkins made the decision to fire Chamberlin and continue as a trio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Tom|last=Hoare|url=http://www.thedrummersjournal.com/blog/the-jimmy-chamberlin-interview|title=The Jimmy Chamberlin Interview|magazine=The Drummer's Journal|date=October 16, 2015|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shakeup, coupled with Corgan going through a divorce and the death of his mother, influenced the somber mood of the band's next album, 1998's ''[[Adore (The Smashing Pumpkins album)|Adore]]''. Featuring a darker, more subdued and heavily electronic sound at a time when [[alternative rock]] was declining in mainstream cachet, ''Adore'' divided both critics and fans, resulting in a significant decrease in album sales (it sold 1.3 million discs in the US).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Greg|last=Kot|title=Pumpkin Seeds|magazine=[[Guitar World]]|publisher=NewBay Media|location=New York City|date=January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chamberlin was reunited with the band in 1999. In 2000, they released ''[[Machina/The Machines of God]]'', a [[concept album]] on which the band deliberately played to their public image. Critics were again divided, and sales were lower than ever; ''Machina'' is the second lowest-selling commercially released Smashing Pumpkins album to date, with U.S. sales of 583,000 units up to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Jonathan|last=Cohen|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/62521/smashing-pumpkins-to-reunite|title=Smashing Pumpkins to Reunite?|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=June 21, 2005|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the recording for ''Machina'', Wretzky quit the band and was replaced for the upcoming tour by former [[Hole (band)|Hole]] bassist [[Melissa Auf der Maur]]. In 2000 the band announced they would break up at the end of the year, and soon after released ''[[Machina II/The Friends &amp; Enemies of Modern Music]]'' free over the Internet. The Smashing Pumpkins played their last show on December 2, 2000, at the [[Cabaret Metro]].

In 2004, Corgan began writing revealing autobiographical posts on his website and his MySpace page, blaming Iha for the breakup of the Smashing Pumpkins, calling Wretzky "a mean spirited drug addict," and criticizing his former [[Zwan]] bandmates' fixation with "[[indie cred]]" and calling them "filthy", opportunistic, and selfish.&lt;ref name="Corgan, Billy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Corgan, Billy |date=February 17, 2004 |title=Smashing Pumpkins (weblog) |format=http |website=[[Livejournal]] |url=http://billycorgan.livejournal.com/2004/02/17/ |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091222215730/http://billycorgan.livejournal.com/2004/02/17/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 22, 2009 |accessdate=June 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new album, titled ''[[Zeitgeist (The Smashing Pumpkins album)|Zeitgeist]],'' was released in the United States on July 10, 2007, and debuted at No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' charts.

In summer 2009 Corgan formed the band [[Spirits in the Sky]] to play a tribute concert to the late [[Sky Saxon]] of [[the Seeds]]. He then toured with the band, composed of ex-[[Catherine (alternative rock band)|Catherine]] member and "Superchrist" producer Kerry Brown, the late [[Electric Prunes]] bassist [[Mark Tulin]], [[Strawberry Alarm Clock]] keyboardist [[Mark Weitz]], frequent Corgan collaborator [[Linda Strawberry]], flautist Kevin Dippold, "Superchrist" violinist [[Ysanne Spevack]], saxist [[Justin Norman]], new Pumpkins drummer [[Mike Byrne (musician)|Mike Byrne]], and [[Jane's Addiction]] guitarist [[Dave Navarro]], playing covers and new Pumpkins material at several clubs in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smashingpumpkins.com/pages/news/dave-navarro-mark-weitz-join-spirits-in-sky-tour-roster|title=The Official Smashing Pumpkins|work=The Official Smashing Pumpkins|accessdate=October 27, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315073131/http://www.smashingpumpkins.com/pages/news/dave-navarro-mark-weitz-join-spirits-in-sky-tour-roster|archivedate=March 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smashingpumpkins.com/pages/news/bc-solo-tour-ends|title=The Official Smashing Pumpkins|work=The Official Smashing Pumpkins|accessdate=October 27, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315073136/http://www.smashingpumpkins.com/pages/news/bc-solo-tour-ends|archivedate=March 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the tour, Corgan, Byrne, Tulin, and Brown headed back to Chicago to begin work on the new Smashing Pumpkins album, ''[[Teargarden by Kaleidyscope]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=studiodog|author=Kerry Brown|number=3749867800|date=4 September 2009|title=Listening 2 killer demos as I pack for chicago 2 meet @billy and start the S.P. recordings... :)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lineup at the time which included new bassist [[Nicole Fiorentino]], toured through much of 2010, then spent 2011 recording the "album-within-an-album" ''[[Oceania (The Smashing Pumpkins album)|Oceania]]'' and mounting tours of the United States and Europe. However, Byrne and Fiorentino would later leave the band in 2014.

In April Corgan announced a new solo record of "experimental" recordings he made in 2007, via the Smashing Pumpkins' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smashingpumpkinsnexus.com/#!News-on-AEGEA-WPCs-Upcoming-Private-Press-Record-Release/c7ba/1470738B-3C10-433B-BFC4-98D2EB7F9510|title=The Official Smashing Pumpkins|work=The Official Smashing Pumpkins|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album, which he titled ''[[AEGEA]],'' was slated to be released exclusively on vinyl, with 250 copies being made; 200 of those copies would be sold online, through Madame Zuzu's Tea House's online store, 30 would be sold at Madame Zuzu's Tea House itself, 10 would be sold by way of famed [[Vintage Vinyl]], in [[Evanston, Illinois]], and 10 were set aside for promotion.&lt;ref name="smashingpumpkinsnexus.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smashingpumpkinsnexus.com/#!AEGEA-UPDATE/c7ba/EE4C67CC-FAE8-4B9C-AABE-44BEB2DE2263|title=The Official Smashing Pumpkins|work=The Official Smashing Pumpkins|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was released on May 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madamezuzus.com/aegea/aegea-by-wpc-2nd-pressing|title=AEGEA BY WPC:2nd PRESSING|accessdate=May 27, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527211815/http://www.madamezuzus.com/aegea/aegea-by-wpc-2nd-pressing|archivedate=May 27, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 2014, Corgan announced that the tapes from his "Siddhartha" show from March 2014 were being transferred for sale, much in the vein of ''[[AEGEA]].''

During the summer 2014, Corgan recorded The Smashing Pumpkins's tenth studio album, ''[[Monuments to an Elegy]],'' with [[Tommy Lee]] and [[Jeff Schroeder]].

In September 2015, Corgan started a blog of vintage photographs that he himself curated, and which he called "People and Their Cars." The website also included an email listing for the blog, titled "The Red Border Club." This list was to be used for information on upcoming People and Their Cars and "Hexestential" books and merchandise, along with access to additional images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fulmer|first1=Elias|title=Billy Corgan’s Latest Project: People and Their Cars|url=http://www.alternativenation.net/billy-corgan-people-and-their-cars/|website=Alternative Nation|accessdate=7 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007024511/http://www.alternativenation.net/billy-corgan-people-and-their-cars/|archivedate=October 7, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleandtheircars.com/ People and Their Cars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021150849/http://www.peopleandtheircars.com/|date=October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2016, Corgan announced, in a Facebook live video, that he had recorded a new solo album with producer [[Rick Rubin]], and it would consist of 12 or 13 tracks.

On February 16, 2018, Corgan announced a reunion tour for [[The Smashing Pumpkins]]. The lineup consists of himself, [[James Iha]], [[Jimmy Chamberlin]], and [[Jeff Schroeder]]. It is rumored that former bassist [[D'arcy Wretzky]] was not a part of the lineup due to unresolved tension between her and Corgan. However, she has stated that after offering her a contract, Corgan retracted it, saying that "we also have to balance the forces at play... there is no room for error."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2018/02/billy-corgan-darcy-wretzky-feud-smashing-pumpkins-reunion-timeline/|title=Smashing Pumpkins Reunion Feud: A Timeline|date=2018-02-13|work=Spin|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Wretzky released text messages between her and Corgan, a feud ensued, which each party attacking with biting remarks.

==Personal life==
Corgan has struggled with depression for much of his life, and has endured bouts of [[self-harm]], [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] and [[suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref name="half of us"&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Joel Schumacher]] (director)|title=Half of Us|medium=[[FLV]]|publisher=[[mtvU]]|url=http://www.halfofus.com/video/?videoID=33&amp;chapterID=1|date=March 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corgan attributes these problems to the abuse he endured as a child as well as personal anxieties and other issues.&lt;ref name="half of us"/&gt; Corgan has since become an advocate for abuse support networks.&lt;ref name="half of us"/&gt;

His mother Martha died in December 1996. The song "For Martha", from ''[[Adore (The Smashing Pumpkins album)|Adore]]'', was written in her memory. In the early 2000s Corgan named his label Martha's Music after her as well.

You can't throw enough things down the abyss with a person like that" and said he parted ways with her. Shortly after, when Hole's ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'' was released, Corgan unleashed on Twitter a set of anger-filled words against her in reference to including two songs he wrote, "Samantha" and "How Dirty Girls Get Clean", that ended up on the new album without his permission. Love then wrote an apology to him on her Facebook account, but the feud continued nevertheless. Corgan took to Twitter again in six parts, attacking her again. Love responded to Corgan on Twitter, saying "All i am is nice about you so if you wanna be mean be mean i don't feel anything. i have too much to feel dear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Daniel|last= Kreps|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/14639/82894|title=Billy Corgan Lashes Out at Courtney Love Over 'Nobody's Daughter'|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media LLC|location=New York City|date=April 27, 2010|accessdate=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corgan said after the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 election]], "I'm very proud of my country right now for doing the right thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q47FjfbWYPs|title=Billy Corgan on Obama|work=YouTube|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since said that he has been disappointed with [[Barack Obama]]'s presidency, and lacks faith in both major political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2012/06/20/billy-corgan-on-barack-obama-he-ran-on-a-moral-compass-agenda-but-what-happened/|title=Billy Corgan on Barack Obama: "He ran on a moral compass agenda … but, what happened?" – Piers Morgan – CNN.com Blogs|publisher=Piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com|accessdate=July 9, 2012|date=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he posted a transcript of a webcast by political activist [[Lyndon LaRouche]] to the official Smashing Pumpkins forum.&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smashingpumpkins.com/board/index.php?showtopic=1750|title=The Official Smashing Pumpkins|work=The Official Smashing Pumpkins|accessdate=October 27, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315073300/http://www.smashingpumpkins.com/board/index.php?showtopic=1750|archivedate=March 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he characterized progressive political campaigners as "[[social justice warrior]]s", compared them to [[Maoism|Maoists]], cult members and the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and called them a threat to freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/billy-corgan-compares-social-justice-warriors-to-cults-maoists-kkk-20160419|title=Billy Corgan Compares 'Social Justice Warriors' to Cults, Maoists, KKK|last1=Blistein|first1=Jon|date=19 April 2016|website=[[rollingstone.com]]|access-date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Corgan revealed that he is a "free-market libertarian capitalist" and added that he has not voted since 1992 when he voted for [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2018/03/billy-corgan-talks-free-market-libertarian-politics-darcy-and-cat-magazines-in-new-interview/|title=Billy Corgan Talks “Free-market Libertarian” Politics, D’arcy, and Cat Magazines in New Interview|date=March 22, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 10, 2009, Corgan testified in front of Congress on behalf of the musicFIRST Coalition. Corgan spoke in favor of H.R. 848, the Performance Rights Act, which gives musicians and artists their share of compensation when their music is played on music radio stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smashingpumpkins.com/pages/news/billy-corgan-speaks-at-congressional-hearing|title=Smashing Pumpkins|publisher=Smashing Pumpkins|accessdate=July 26, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113224745/http://www.smashingpumpkins.com/pages/news/billy-corgan-speaks-at-congressional-hearing|archivedate=November 13, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corgan has in recent years increasingly espoused conspiracy theories, voiced his admiration for radio host [[Alex Jones]]&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt; and frequently appeared as a guest on the latter's radio show, where he has endorsed conspiracy theories such as the [[chemtrail conspiracy theory]], and the connection between [[vaccine]]s and [[autism]], that [[swine influenza]] was an "Obama conspiracy" and "propaganda" and decried the "emasculation" of men in contemporary society.&lt;ref name="salon.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Alex|last=Seitz-Wald|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/03/25/billy_corgan_hearts_conspiracy_theorist/|title=Billy Corgan Hearts Conspiracy Theorist|website=[[Salon.com]]|publisher=[[Salon Media Group]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=March 25, 2013|accessdate=March 13, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330132122/http://www.salon.com/2013/03/25/billy_corgan_hearts_conspiracy_theorist/|archivedate=March 30, 2016|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michelle|last=Geslani|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/12/billy-corgan-tells-alex-jones-hes-a-dangerous-artist-whose-voice-is-stifled-by-assassins-like-anderson-cooper/ |title=Billy Corgan tells Alex Jones he’s a "dangerous artist" whose voice is stifled by "assassins" like Anderson Cooper |website=[[Consequence of Sound]]|publisher=Consequence Holdings, LLC|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=December 12, 2014|accessdate=April 26, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502182405/http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/12/billy-corgan-tells-alex-jones-hes-a-dangerous-artist-whose-voice-is-stifled-by-assassins-like-anderson-cooper/ |archivedate=May 2, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He shared songwriting credit on several songs on [[Hole (band)|Hole]]'s 1998 album ''[[Celebrity Skin]]''; the title track became Corgan's second No. 1 modern rock hit. He also acted as a consultant for [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] during the recording of the album ''[[Mechanical Animals]]''. He has produced three soundtracks for the movies ''[[Ransom (1996 film)|Ransom]]'' (1996), ''[[Stigmata (film)|Stigmata]]'' (1999) and ''[[Spun]]'' (2002) in which he appeared as a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283003/fullcredits#cast|title=Spun (2002)|work=IMDb|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corgan appeared at the 1996 [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] ceremonies. He inducted one of his biggest musical influences, [[Pink Floyd]]. He played acoustic guitar during the ceremony with Pink Floyd, when they performed their song [[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd song)|"Wish You Were Here"]].

In particular, Corgan guided and collaborated with three bands in the 2000s—[[Breaking Benjamin]] (during sessions for 2004's ''[[We Are Not Alone (Breaking Benjamin album)|We Are Not Alone]]''), [[Taproot (band)|Taproot]] (for ''[[Blue-Sky Research]]'', 2005), and [[Sky Saxon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smashingpumpkins.com/pages/news/2906|title=The Official Smashing Pumpkins|work=The Official Smashing Pumpkins|accessdate=October 27, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301145202/http://www.smashingpumpkins.com/pages/news/2906|archivedate=March 1, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Corgan claimed co-writing credit (with ex-girlfriend [[Courtney Love]]) on at least two of the songs on [[Hole (band)|Hole's]] final album ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'' and tried to assert a right of approval before the album could be released. Corgan had helped develop the album during its early stages. The album was released without the writing controversy ever being litigated or publicly resolved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vulture.com/2010/03/courtney_love_wants_to_be_pals.html - accessed 9 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/hole-reveal-track-list-cover-for-april-27s-nobodys-daughter-71171/ - accessed 9 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical style and influences==
[[File:Billy Corgan pic.jpg|thumb|upright|Corgan performing during the Mellon Collie tour]]
When asked in a 1994 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview about his influences, Corgan replied:

{{quote|text=Eight years old, I put on the [[Black Sabbath (album)|Black Sabbath record]], and my life is forever changed. It sounded so heavy. It rattled the bones. I wanted that feeling. With [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] and [[The Cure]], it was the ability to create a mood and an atmosphere. The air gets heavier. With Jimi Hendrix it was the ability to translate this other level of guitar. Cheap Trick – it was a vocal influence. Although [[Tom Petersson]] once told me that [[Rick Nielsen]] called us 'tuneless and nonmelodic.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starla.org/articles/rs94.htm|title=Rolling Stone Interview, 1994.|accessdate=June 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Corgan wrote six articles for ''[[Guitar World]]'' in 1995, and his [[guitar solo|solo]]s for "[[Cherub Rock]]" and "[[Geek U.S.A.]]" were included on their list of the top guitar solos of all time. [[AllMusic]] said "Starla" "proves that Corgan was one of the finest (and most underrated) rock guitarists of the '90s",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=Ahx65mpbf9fco|title=Pisces Iscariot|accessdate=October 7, 2006|last=Prato|first=Greg|format=http|work=Allmusic|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213051514/http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg|archivedate=December 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called him and his Smashing Pumpkins bandmates "ruthless virtuosos". His solo for "[[Soma (song)|Soma]]" was No. 24 on ''Rolling Stone''&amp;apos;s list of the top guitar solos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Rolling Stone|date=August 6, 2007|title=The 25 Coolest Guitar Solos|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/08/06/the-25-coolest-guitar-solos/|accessdate=August 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a fan of [[Eddie Van Halen]] and interviewed him in 1996 for ''Guitar World''. Other guitarists Corgan rates highly include [[Uli Jon Roth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9IX4BOE7ag|title=Billy Corgan und Uli Jon Roth (1/6)|work=YouTube|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Iommi]], [[Ritchie Blackmore]], [[Leslie West]], [[Dimebag Darrell]] and [[Robin Trower]].&lt;ref name="uguitar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/smashing_pumpkins_there_are_always_more_riffs_than_words.html |title=Smashing Pumpkins: 'There Are Always More Riffs Than Words' |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |accessdate=October 27, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027154534/http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/smashing_pumpkins_there_are_always_more_riffs_than_words.html |archivedate=October 27, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His bass playing, which has featured on nearly every Smashing Pumpkins album, was influenced by [[post-punk]] figures like [[Peter Hook]] and [[Simon Gallup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eqmag.com/article/cutting-room-floor/sep-08/87047] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917000610/http://www.eqmag.com/article/cutting-room-floor/sep-08/87047|date=September 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corgan has praised [[Radiohead]], saying "if they're not the best band in the world, then they're one of the best". He is also a fan of [[Pantera]].&lt;ref&gt;Interview: Billy Corgan.

He has listed his artistic influences as [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Jack Kerouac]], and [[Philip K. Dick]].&lt;ref name="Listessa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corgan, Billy.

==Instruments==
{{BLP sources section|date=August 2015}}
Corgan played (during the ''Gish''-''Siamese Dream'' era) a customized '57 Reissue [[Fender Stratocaster]] equipped with three Fender Lace Sensor pickups (the Lace Sensor Blue in the neck position, the Lace Sensor Silver in the middle position, and the Lace Sensor Red at the bridge position). It also has a five-position pickup selector switch which he installed himself. This battered Strat became his number one guitar by default. He owned a '74 Strat that was stolen shortly after ''Gish'' was completed.

Corgan also used a wide variety of guitars on ''Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness''. On "Where Boys Fear to Tread", Corgan used a [[Les Paul Junior]] Reissue, and on "[[Tonight, Tonight (The Smashing Pumpkins song)|Tonight Tonight]]" he used a '72 [[Gibson ES-335]]. He is also known to use a '74 Strat which has since been painted baby blue. That guitar was used on the recordings for "[[Bullet with Butterfly Wings]]" and also "[[Muzzle (song)|Muzzle]]", because the heavier wood gave it the basic Strat sound with a bit more bottom.

During the recording and tour of the album ''Zeitgeist'', Corgan used a [[Schecter Guitar Research|Schecter]] C-1 EX baritone, finished in black with Tony Iommi signature pickups.

Corgan also endorsed [[Reverend Guitars]] in his [[Zwan]] era, most notably playing a Reverend Slingshot.

In 2008 Corgan released to the market his own Fender Stratocaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fender.com/products//search.php?partno=0115002806|title=Fender Artist Series – Billy Corgan Stratocaster|date=|accessdate=2015-10-08|website=[[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation]]|publisher=|last=|first=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702072711/http://www.fender.com/products//search.php?partno=0115002806|archivedate=2008-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new guitar was made to Corgan's exact specs to create his famous mid-'90s buzzsaw tone; the instrument features three DiMarzio pickups (two custom for this instrument), a string-through hardtail bridge and a satin nitrocellulose lacquer finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gruhn's Guide to Vintage Guitars: An Identification Guide for American Fretted Instruments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M-3HoVgxFBIC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=billy+corgan+%252757+Reissue+strat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l7hcPpPsYi&amp;sig=yVcQkuHw8fAvJYiymyATRxiftXo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBDgKahUKEwiFiaDUgbLIAhXDFT4KHQOIAFY#v=onepage&amp;q=billy%2520corgan%2520'57%2520Reissue%2520strat&amp;f=false|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|date=2010-01-01|isbn=9780879309442|first=George|last=Gruhn|first2=Walter|last2=Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt; When playing live, he uses both his signature Strats as well as two other Fender Strats, one in red with a white pick guard and one in silver-grey with a black pick guard; a Gibson [[Tony Iommi]] signature [[Gibson SG|SG]]; and his Schecter C-1 (only used on the ''Zeitgeist'' song "United States").

A video called 'Stompland' on the official Smashing Pumpkins YouTube channel is informative on Corgan's choice of effects pedals. In the video he reveals an extensive collection of pedals used throughout his career with the Smashing Pumpkins. Corgan's tone is often characterized by his use of fuzz pedals, particularly vintage versions of the [[Electro-Harmonix Big Muff]] &lt;ref name=Stompland&gt;{{cite web|title=Stompland|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZemTcTyJKs|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 [[Reverend guitars|Reverend Guitars]] released the BC-1 Billy Corgan signature guitar featuring Railhammer Billy Corgan signature pickups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reverendguitars.com/guitars/billy-corgan-signature|title=Reverend Guitars - Billy Corgan Signature|website=www.reverendguitars.com|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reverend Billy Corgan Signature [[Terz guitar|Terz]] was launched at the 2018 [[NAMM Show|NAMM]] show—an electric version of a 19th-century instrument that is played as if the guitar is capoed at the third fret, and tuned G-g standard. Corgan often uses the capo at the third fret and asked for a higher-register guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gearnews.com/namm-2018-reverend-billy-corgan-terz/|title=NAMM 2018: Reverend Guitars Billy Corgan Terz model - gearnews.com|date=2018-01-26|work=gearnews.com|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corgan is noted for having used [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] and [[Diezel]] amps. He has also used modular preamps based off many different amps in conjunction with [[Mesa Boogie]] poweramps. The preamps were built custom built by Salvation Mods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Rig_Rundown_Smashing_Pumpkins_Billy_Corgan|title=Rig Rundown - Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bret Easton Ellis''' (born March 7, 1964) is an American author, screenwriter, and short story writer. His works have been translated into 27 languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/eastonellis/#/author-bio "Imperial Bedrooms by Bret Easton Ellis"]. randomhouse.com. Retrieved July 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He was at first regarded as one of the so-called literary [[Brat Pack (literary)|Brat Pack]],&lt;ref name="bratpack"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/birnbaum_v/bret_easton_ellis.php| title = Birnbaum v.

He is a self-proclaimed [[satire|satirist]] whose trademark technique, as a writer, is the expression of extreme acts and opinions in an affectless style.&lt;ref name="satirist moralist"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2010/jul/19/bret-easton-ellis-video-morality-technology|title=Video: 'I really wasn't that concerned about morality in my fiction'|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=July 28, 2010|date=July 19, 2010|last3=MacInnes|last2=Gallagher|last1=Salfield|first3=Paul|first2=Andy|first1=Alice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moralist"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2005/08/21/2003268662| title = Bret Easton Ellis loses a few marbles in 'Lunar Park'| publisher = taipeitimes.com| work = Taipei Times| date = August 21, 2005| accessdate = February 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis employs a technique of linking novels with common, recurring characters.

At the age of 21, his first novel, the controversial bestseller ''[[Less Than Zero (novel)|Less Than Zero]]'' (1985), was published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. His third novel, ''[[American Psycho]]'' (1991) was his most successful; upon release, the literary establishment widely condemned the novel as overly violent and [[Misogyny|misogynistic]]. Though many petitions to ban the book saw Ellis dropped by Simon &amp; Schuster, the resounding controversy convinced [[Alfred A. Knopf]] to release it as a paperback later that year. In later years, Ellis' novels have become increasingly [[metafiction]]al. ''[[Lunar Park]]'' (2005), a pseudo-memoir and ghost story, received positive reviews. ''[[Imperial Bedrooms]]'' (2010), marketed as a sequel to ''Less Than Zero'', continues in this vein.

Four of Ellis's works have been made into films. ''Less Than Zero'' was adapted for screen in 1987 with a [[Less Than Zero (film)|film of the same name]], however the film bore little resemblance to the novel. [[Mary Harron]]'s [[American Psycho (film)|adaptation of ''American Psycho'']] was released to generally positive reviews in 2000. [[Roger Avary]]'s 2002 adaptation ''[[The Rules of Attraction (film)|The Rules of Attraction]]'' made modest box office returns. 2008's ''[[The Informers (2008 film)|The Informers]]'', based on Ellis's collection of short stories, was critically panned. Ellis also wrote the screenplay for the critically derided 2013 film ''[[The Canyons (film)|The Canyons]]''.

==Life and career==
Ellis was born in Los Angeles and raised in [[Sherman Oaks]] in the [[San Fernando Valley]]. His father, Robert Martin Ellis, was a property developer, and his mother, Dale (Dennis) Ellis, was a homemaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World authors 1990–1995|editor-last=Thompson|editor-first=Clifford|publisher=[[H. W. Wilson Company|H.W. Wilson]]|year=1999|isbn=978-0-8242-0956-8|page=215|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cWoYAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA215}}&lt;/ref&gt; They divorced in 1982. Ellis stated, during the initial release of his third novel ''American Psycho,'' that his father was abusive, and he became the basis of that book's best-known character [[Patrick Bateman]]. Later, Ellis claimed the character was not in fact based on his father, but on Ellis himself, saying that all of his work came from a specific place of pain he was going through in his life during the writing of each of his books. Ellis claims that while his family life growing up was somewhat difficult due to the divorce, he mostly had an "idyllic" California childhood.&lt;ref name="podcastone.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=PodcastOne |url=http://podcastone.com/Bret-Easton-Ellis-Podcast |title=Bret Easton Ellis Podcast |publisher=Podcastone.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis was educated at [[Buckley School (California)|The Buckley School]] in California; he then attended [[Bennington College]] in Vermont, where he originally studied music then gradually gravitated to writing, which had been one of his passions since childhood. There he met and befriended [[Donna Tartt]] and [[Jonathan Lethem]], who both would later become published writers.  Bennington College was also where Ellis completed a novel he had been working on for many years. That book, ''Less Than Zero'', went on to be published while Ellis was just 21 and still in college, thus propelling him to instant fame.

After the success and controversy of ''Less Than Zero'' in 1985, Ellis became closely associated and good friends with fellow Brat Pack writer [[Jay McInerney]]: the two became known as the "toxic twins" for their highly publicized late night debauchery.

Ellis became a pariah for a time following the release of ''American Psycho'' (1991), which later became a critical and cult hit, more so after its [[American Psycho (film)|2000 movie adaptation]]. It has now been regarded as Ellis' ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', garnering acknowledgement from a number of academics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} ''The Informers'' (1994) was offered to his publisher during ''[[Glamorama]]'''s long writing history. Ellis wrote a screenplay for [[The Rules of Attraction (film)|''The Rules of Attraction''{{'}}s film adaptation]], which was not used. Ellis records a fictionalized version of his life story up until this point in the first chapter of ''Lunar Park'' (2005). After the death of his lover Michael Wade Kaplan, Ellis was spurred to finish ''Lunar Park'' and inflected it with a new tone of wistfulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Tone of Wistfulness for Lunar Park|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/07/arts/07wyat.html?pagewanted=print|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 7, 2005|accessdate=March 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis was approached by young screenwriter [[Nicholas Jarecki]] to adapt ''The Informers'' into a film; the script they co-wrote was cut from 150 to 94 pages and taken from Jarecki to give to Australian director [[Gregor Jordan]], whose light-on-humor vision of the film was met with unanimously negative reviews {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Informers|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10008991-informers/|accessdate=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[The Informers (2009 film)|the film]] was released in 2009.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Despite setbacks as a screenwriter, Ellis teamed up with acclaimed director [[Gus Van Sant]] in 2009 to adapt the ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' article "The Golden Suicides" into a film of the same name, depicting the paranoid final days and suicides of celebrity artists [[Theresa Duncan]] and [[Jeremy Blake]]. The film, as of 2014, has never been made. When Van Sant appeared on ''The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast'' on February 12, 2014, he stated that he was never attached to the project as a screenwriter or a director, merely a consultant, claiming that the material seemed too tricky for him to properly render on screen. Ellis and Van Sant mentioned that [[Naomi Watts]] and [[Ryan Gosling]] were approached to star as Duncan and Blake, respectively. Ellis confirmed that he and his producing partner [[Braxton Pope]] are still working on the project, with Ellis revisiting the screenplay from time to time. As of April 2014, radical filmmaker [[Gaspar Noé]] was officially attached to direct if the film went into production, but he proved troublesome to work with due to his erratic behavior.&lt;ref name="podcastone.com"/&gt;

In 2010, Ellis released ''Imperial Bedrooms'', the sequel to his début novel. Ellis wrote it following his return to LA and fictionalizes his work on the film adaptation of ''The Informers'', from the perspective of Clay. Positive reviews felt it was a culmination of the themes begun respectively in ''Less Than Zero,'' ''American Psycho'' and ''Lunar Park''.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Negative reviews noted the novel's rehashed themes and listless writing.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Ellis expressed interest in writing the screenplay for the ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey (2014 film)|Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' film adaptation. He discussed casting with his followers, and even mentioned meeting with the film's producers, as well as noting he felt it went well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/12/bret-easton-ellis-fifty-shades-grey | title = Could Bret Easton Ellis bring Fifty Shades of Grey to fruition? | date = June 12, 2012 | accessdate = July 30, 2012 | first= Ben | last= Child | work = [[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2158330/Fifty-Shades-Of-Grey-movie-Scarlett-Johansson-perfect-Ana-says-writer-Bret-Easton-Ellis.html | title = 'Scarlett Johansson is the perfect Ana': Writer Bret Easton Ellis on who should play the lead in film of 'mommy porn' bestseller Fifty Shades of Grey (and he wants to write the script) | date = June 12, 2012 | accessdate = July 30, 2012 | first= Jade | last= Watkins | work = [[Daily Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/BretEastonEllis/status/229036662385147905 "Fifty Shades of Grey: a very positive meeting last week with producers Michael De Luca and Dana Brunetti.

In 2012, Ellis wrote the screenplay for the independent film ''[[The Canyons (film)|The Canyons]]'' and helped raise money for its production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1094772583/the-canyons |title=The Canyons by Braxton Pope – Kickstarter |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date=June 9, 2012 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in 2013 and although critically panned, was a small financial success, with the performance of [[Lindsay Lohan]] in the lead role earning some positive reviews.

==Personal life==
[[File:Bret_Easton_Ellis_The_Arches_Glasgow.jpg|thumb|Brett Easton Ellis photographed by [[Alan Dimmick]] in [[Glasgow]], 1998.]]
When asked in an interview in 2002 whether he was gay, Ellis explained that he does not identify himself as gay or straight; he is comfortable being thought of as homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual, and enjoys playing with his persona, identifying variously as gay, straight, and bisexual to different people over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Attractions of Bret Easton Ellis|url=http://www.metroweekly.com/feature/?ak=126|first=Randy|last=Shulman|date=October 10, 2002|accessdate=April 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1999 interview, the author suggested that his reluctance to definitively label his sexuality is for "artistic reasons".

"I think the last time I slept with a woman was five or six years ago, so the bi thing can only be played out so long," he clarified.

''Lunar Park'' was dedicated to his lover, Michael Wade Kaplan, and Ellis' father, Robert Ellis, who died in 1992. In one interview, Ellis described feeling a liberation in the completion of the novel that allowed him to come to terms with unresolved issues regarding his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chuckpalahniuk.net/features/interviews/breteastonellis/|title=Bret Easton Ellis|accessdate=September 26, 2007|author=Dennis Widmyer|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018072849/http://www.chuckpalahniuk.net/features/interviews/breteastonellis/|archivedate=October 18, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the "author Q&amp;A" for ''Lunar Park'' on the [[Random House]] website, Ellis comments on his relationship with Robert, and says he feels that his father was a "tough case" who left him damaged. Having grown older and having "mellow[ed] out", Ellis describes how his opinion of his father changed since 15&amp;nbsp;years ago when writing ''Glamorama'' (in which the central conspiracy concerns the relationship of a father and son).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780375412912&amp;view=qa|title=A Conversation with Bret Easton Ellis|accessdate=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even earlier in his career, Ellis based the character of Patrick Bateman from ''American Psycho'' on his father.&lt;ref name="batmanfather"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780307264305&amp;view=auqa| title = Author Q &amp; A: A conversation with Bret Easton Ellis| publisher = randomhouse.com| accessdate = February 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 interview, however, he claims to have lied about this explanation. Explaining that "Patrick Bateman was about me," he confesses "I didn't want to finally own up to the responsibility of being Patrick Bateman, so I laid it on my father, I laid it on Wall Street." In reality, the book had been "about me at the time, and I wrote about all my rage and feelings."&lt;ref name=RobertFColeman/&gt; To James Brown, he clarified Bateman was based on "my father a little bit but I was living that lifestyle; my father wasn't in New York the same age as Patrick Bateman, living in the same building, going to the same places that Patrick Bateman was going to."&lt;ref name=SabotageTimes/&gt;

Ellis named his first novel and his latest after two [[Elvis Costello]] references: "[[Less Than Zero (song)|Less Than Zero]]" and ''[[Imperial Bedroom]]'' respectively. Ellis named [[Bruce Springsteen]] his "musical hero" in a 2010 interview with ''[[NME]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/bret-easton-ellis-pieces-of-me-773471 |title=Bret Easton Ellis -- Pieces of Me |last=Blog |first=NME |date=Aug 5, 2010 |website=NME |publisher=NME |access-date=Aug 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Ellis's first novel, ''[[Less Than Zero (novel)|Less Than Zero]]'', is a tale of disaffected, rich teenagers of Los Angeles written and re-written over a five-year period from Ellis's second year in high school, earlier drafts being "...&amp;nbsp;more autobiographical and read like teen diaries or journal entries—lots of stuff about the bands I liked, the beach, the Galleria, clubs, driving around, doing drugs, partying", according to Ellis.&lt;ref name="theparisreview.org"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6127/the-art-of-fiction-no-216-bret-easton-ellis |title=The Art of Fiction No. 216, Bret Easton Ellis |magazine=[[The Paris Review]] |issue=200 |first=Jon-Jon |last=Goulian |date=Spring 2012 |accessdate=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was praised by critics and sold well (50,000 copies in its first year). He moved back to New York City in 1987 for the publication of his second novel, ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]'' – described by Ellis as "...&amp;nbsp;an attempt to write the kind of college novel I had always wanted to read and could never find"&lt;ref name="theparisreview.org"/&gt; – which follows a group of sexually promiscuous college students. Influenced heavily by [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' and its [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] narrative technique, ''...&amp;nbsp;Attraction'' sold fairly well, though Ellis admits he felt he had "fallen off" after the novel failed to match the success of his debut effort, Ellis reflecting in 2012 " I was very obsessive, very protective about that book, perhaps overly so."&lt;ref name="theparisreview.org"/&gt; His most controversial work is the graphically violent ''[[American Psycho]]'', which Ellis states "...came out of a place of severe alienation and loneliness and self-loathing. I was pursuing a life—you could call it the [[GQ|Gentlemen's Quarterly]] way of living—that I knew was bullshit, and yet I couldn't seem to help it."&lt;ref name="theparisreview.org"/&gt; The book was intended to be published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], but they withdrew after external protests from groups such as the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) and many others due to the allegedly misogynistic nature of the book. The novel was later published by [[Vintage (publishers)|Vintage]]. Some consider this novel, whose protagonist, [[Patrick Bateman]], is both a cartoonishly materialistic [[yuppie]] and a serial killer, to be an example of [[transgressive art]]. ''American Psycho'' has achieved considerable cult status.

Ellis's collection of short stories, ''[[The Informers]]'', was published in 1994. It contains vignettes of wayward Los Angeles characters ranging from rock stars to vampires, mostly written while Ellis was in college, and so has more in common with the style of ''Less Than Zero.'' Ellis has said that the stories in ''The Informers'' were collected and released only to fulfill a contractual obligation after discovering that it would take far longer to complete his next novel than he'd intended. After years of struggling with it, Ellis released his fourth novel ''[[Glamorama]]'' in 1998. ''Glamorama'' is set in the world of high fashion, following a male model who becomes entangled in a bizarre terrorist organization composed entirely of other models. The book plays with themes of media, celebrity, and political violence, and like its predecessor ''American Psycho'' it uses surrealism to convey a sense of postmodern dread. Although the reactions to the novel were mixed, Ellis holds it in high esteem among his own works: "...&amp;nbsp;it's probably the best novel I've written and the one that means the most to me. And when I say "best"—the wrong word, I suppose, but I'm not sure what else to replace it with—I mean that I'll never have that energy again, that kind of focus sustained for eight years on a single project. I'll never spend that amount of time crafting a book that means that much to me. And I think people who have read all of my work and are fans understand that about Glamorama—it's the one book out of the seven I've published that matters the most."&lt;ref name="theparisreview.org"/&gt; Ellis's novel ''[[Lunar Park]]'' (2005), uses the form of a celebrity memoir to tell a ghost story about the novelist "Bret Easton Ellis" and his chilling experiences in the apparently haunted home he shares with his wife and son. In keeping with his usual style, Ellis mixes absurd comedy with a bleak and violent vision.

In 2010, Ellis released a follow-up to ''Less Than Zero'' entitled ''[[Imperial Bedrooms]]'' (2010). Taking place 25 years after the events of Ellis' [[debut novel]], it combines the postmodernism of ''Lunar Park'' with the unaltered ennui of ''Less Than Zero.'' The book was met with disappointing sales.

For writing the original screenplay for the [[Paul Schrader]] directed film ''[[The Canyons (film)|The Canyons]]'', Ellis won the 'Best Screenplay' award at the 14th [[Melbourne Underground Film Festival]], with the film also winning 'Best Foreign Film,' 'Best Foreign Director' for Schrader and 'Best Female Actor' for [[Lindsay Lohan]].

===Fictional setting and recurring characters===
Ellis often uses recurring characters and settings. Major characters in one novel may become minor ones in the next, or vice versa. [[Camden College (fictional college)|Camden College]], a fictional [[New England]] [[liberal arts]] college, is frequently referenced. It is based on [[Bennington College]], which Ellis himself attended, where he met future novelist [[Jonathan Lethem]] and befriended fellow writers [[Donna Tartt]] and [[Jill Eisenstadt]]. In Tartt's ''[[The Secret History]]'' (1992), her version of Bennington is given as "Hampden College," although there are oblique connections between it and Ellis' ''Rules of Attraction.'' Eisenstadt and Lethem, however, use 'Camden' in ''From Rockaway'' (1987) and ''[[The Fortress of Solitude (novel)|The Fortress of Solitude]]'' (2003), respectively.  Though his three major settings are Vermont, Los Angeles and New York, he doesn't think of these novels as about these places; they are intentionally more universal than that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2010/jul/26/bret-easton-ellis-guardian-book-club|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Guardian book club: John Mullan meets Bret Easton Ellis|accessdate=August 14, 2010|date=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camden is introduced in ''Less Than Zero,'' where it is mentioned that both protagonist Clay and minor character Daniel attend it. In ''The Rules of Attraction'' (1987), where Camden is the setting, Clay (referred to as "The Guy from L.A." before being properly introduced) is a minor character who narrates one chapter; ironically, he longs for the Californian beach, where in Ellis' previous novel he had longed to return to college. On "the guy from L.A.'s door someone wrote "Rest in Peace Called"; R.I.P., or Rip, is Clay's dealer in ''Less Than Zero''; Clay also says that Blair from ''Less than Zero'' sent him a letter saying she thinks Rip was murdered. Main character [[Sean Bateman]]'s older brother [[Patrick Bateman|Patrick]] narrates one chapter of the novel; he would be the infamous central character of Ellis' next novel, ''American Psycho.'' Ellis includes a reference to Tartt's forthcoming ''Secret History'' in the form of a passing mention of "that weird Classics group&amp;nbsp;... probably roaming the countryside sacrificing farmers and performing pagan rituals." There is also an allusion to the main character from Eisenstadt's ''From Rockaway.''

In ''American Psycho'' (1991), Patrick's brother Sean appears briefly. Paul Denton and Victor Johnson from ''The Rules of Attraction'' are both mentioned; on seeing Paul, Patrick wonders if "maybe he was on that cruise a long time ago, one night last March. If that's the case, I'm thinking, I should get his telephone number or, better yet, his address." Camden is referred to as both Sean's college and the college a minor character named Vanden is going to. Vanden was referred to (but never appeared) in both ''Less Than Zero'' and ''The Rules of Attraction.'' Passages from "Less Than Zero" reappear, almost verbatim, here, with Patrick replacing Clay as narrator. Patrick also makes repeated references to [[Jami Gertz]], the actress who portrays Blair in the 1987 film adaptation of ''Less Than Zero.'' Allison Poole from [[Jay McInerney]]'s 1988 novel ''[[Story of My Life (novel)|Story of My Life]]'' appears as a torture victim of Patrick's. 1994's ''[[The Informers]]'' features a much-younger Timothy Price, one of Patrick's co-workers in ''American Psycho,'' who narrates one chapter. One of the central characters, Graham, buys concert tickets from ''Less Than Zero''{{'}}s Julian, and his sister Susan goes on to say that Julian sells heroin and is a male prostitute (as shown in ''Zero''). Alana and Blair from ''Zero'' are also friends of Susan's.  Letters to Sean Bateman from a Camden College girl named Anne visiting grandparents in LA comprise the eighth chapter.

Patrick Bateman appears briefly in ''Glamorama'' (1998); ''Glamorama'''s main characters Victor Ward and Lauren Hynde were first introduced in ''The Rules of Attraction''. As an in-joke reference to Bateman being portrayed by [[Christian Bale]] in the then-in-production 2000 film adaptation, the actor himself briefly appears as a background character. The book also includes a spy called Russell who is physically identical to Bale, and at one point in the novel impersonates him. Jaime Fields, who has a major role in the book, was first briefly mentioned by Victor in ''The Rules of Attraction.'' Bertrand, Sean and Mitchell, all from ''The Rules of Attraction,'' appear in Camden [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] and several other ''Rules'' characters are referenced. McInerney's Alison Poole makes her second appearance in an Ellis novel as Victor's mistress. ''Lunar Park'' (2005) is not set in the same "universe" as Ellis' other novels, but contains a similar multitude of references and allusions. All the author's previous works are heavily referenced, in keeping with the book-within-a-book structure. Jay McInerney cameos. Donald Kimball from ''American Psycho'' questions Ellis on a series of ''American Psycho''-inspired murders, Mitchell Allen from ''Rules'' lives next door to and went to college with Ellis (Ellis even recalls his affair with Paul Denton, alluded to in ''Rules''), and Ellis recalls a tempestuous relationship with Blair from ''Zero.'' ''Imperial Bedrooms'' (2010) establishes the conceit that the Clay depicted in ''Zero'' is not the same Clay who narrates ''Bedrooms.'' In the world of ''Imperial Bedrooms,'' ''Zero'' was the close-to-non-fiction work of an author friend of Clay's, and its film adaptation (featuring actors [[Andrew McCarthy]], Jami Gertz and [[Robert Downey, Jr.]]) exists within the world of the novel, too.

In May 2014, [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]] announced that it had teamed up with ''The Rules of Attraction'' feature film adaptation writer/director Roger Avary and producer Greg Shapiro to develop a limited-run series based on Ellis' novel. The plot of the show will stray from the source material and is described as follows: "Inspired by the book and film of the same name, the high concept series takes the students and faculty at the fictional Camden College and unravels a murder mystery by telling the same story through 12 different points of view. Children of the 1%-ers live as unhinged and wild adults in a Bret Easton Ellis world with seemingly no rules to hold these privileged few down." Titled ''Rules of Attraction'' the series will be written by Roger Avary (''The Rules of Attraction'', ''Beowulf'') for Lionsgate TV with Greg Shapiro (''Zero Dark Thirty'') serving as an Executive Producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/05/bravo-developing-rules-of-attraction-series-adaptation-scripted-projects-set-in-shanghai-marthas-vineyard/ |title=Bravo Developing 'Rules of Attraction' TV Series |publisher=Deadline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the spring of 2014, Ellis has been filming in and around Los Angeles. On his Podcast he had stated that he writes scenes and then when certain locations, equipment and his actors are available, they will spontaneously shoot the material, with Ellis directing. He has also stated via his Podcast, his Twitter, his Instagram and his Facebook that he does not know what form this project will take when they complete it. It could be a feature film or a web-series. The project's producer, and Ellis' producing partner, Braxton Pope, has been regularly posting updates and pictures from the production on his Facebook and Instagram accounts.

==Podcast==

On November 18, 2013, Ellis launched a [[podcast]] with [[PodcastOne|PodcastOne Studios]]. The aim for the show, which delivers 1 hour segments, is to have Ellis engage in open and honest conversation with his guests about their work, inspirations, life experiences as well as music and movies. Ellis, who has always been averse to publicity, has been using the platform to engage in intellectual conversation and debate about his own theoretical observations on the media, the film industry, the music scene and the analog vs. digital age in a generational context. Notable guests have included [[Kanye West]], [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Judd Apatow]], [[Chuck Klosterman]], [[Kevin Smith]], [[Michael Ian Black]], [[Matt Berninger]], [[Brandon Boyd]], [[BJ Novak]], [[Gus Van Sant]], [[Joe Swanberg]], [[Ezra Koenig]], [[Stephen Malkmus]], [[John Densmore]], [[Fred Armisen]] &amp; [[Carrie Brownstein]], [[Ivan Reitman]], and [[Adam Carolla]].
In April 2018, The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast began a Patreon in order to get instant access to new episodes. $1.00+ is charged per episode. It is unclear whether episodes will be released to non-patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ellis|first1=Bret Easton|title=The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast|url=https://www.patreon.com/breteastonellispodcast|website=patreon.com|publisher=Patreon|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coleen Rowley''' (born December 20, 1954) is an [[Americans|American]] former [[FBI]] special agent and [[whistleblower]], and was a [[Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party]] (DFL) candidate for [[United States House of Representatives|Congress]] in [[Minnesota's 2nd congressional district]], one of eight [[Minnesota Congressional Districts|congressional districts in Minnesota]] in 2006. She lost the general election to [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republican]] [[incumbent]] [[John Kline (politician)|John Kline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Results from Congressional District 02|publisher=Minnesota Secretary of State|url=http://electionresults.sos.state.mn.us/20061107/ElecRslts.asp?M=CG&amp;CD=02|accessdate=2006-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Rowley grew up in [[New Hampton, Iowa]] and graduated valedictorian of her high school class in 1973. Her father was a letter carrier for 31 years.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} She received her [[B.A.]] degree in French and with honors from [[Wartburg College]] in [[Waverly, Iowa]] in 1977. In 1980, she received her [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from the [[University of Iowa College of Law]] and passed the [[Iowa]] [[Bar Exam]] that summer.&lt;ref name=pbsnow&gt;Max Lerner [https://www.pbs.org/now/politics/rowley.html Coleen Rowley] Civil liberties in times of war. PBS Now, 3 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===FBI===
In January 1981, Rowley became a Special Agent with the FBI and was assigned to the [[Omaha, Nebraska]] and [[Jackson, Mississippi]] divisions. Beginning in 1984, she spent six years working in the [[New York City]] field office on investigations involving Italian [[organized crime]] and Sicilian heroin. During this time she served three temporary assignments in the  U.S. [[embassy]] in [[Paris]] and the [[consulate]] in [[Montreal]]. In 1990, she was transferred to the FBI's [[Minneapolis]] field office, where she became Chief Division Counsel. There she taught constitutional law to FBI agents and police officers, and oversaw the [[Freedom of information in the United States|Freedom of Information]],  Asset Forfeiture Program, [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|Victim-Witness]] and community outreach programs.&lt;ref name=pbsnow/&gt;

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Rowley wrote a paper for FBI Director [[Robert Mueller]] documenting how FBI HQ personnel in [[Washington, D.C.]], had mishandled and failed to take action on information provided by the [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] Field Office regarding its investigation of suspected terrorist [[Zacarias Moussaoui]]. Moussaoui had been suspected of being involved in preparations for a suicide-hijacking similar to the December 1994 "[[Eiffel Tower]]" hijacking of [[Air France 8969]]. Failures identified by Rowley may have left the U.S. vulnerable to the September 11, 2001, attacks. Rowley was one of many agents frustrated by the events that led up to the attacks, writing:&lt;blockquote&gt;During the early aftermath of September 11th, when I happened to be recounting the pre–September 11th events concerning the Moussaoui investigation to other FBI personnel in other divisions or in FBIHQ, almost everyone's first question was "Why?—Why would an FBI agent(s) deliberately sabotage a case? (I know I shouldn't be flippant about this, but jokes were actually made that the key FBI HQ personnel had to be spies or moles like [[Robert Hanssen]] who were actually working for Osama Bin Laden to have so undercut Minneapolis's effort.)

An edited version of the agent's 13-page letter] American Patriot Friends Network, May 21, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101020603/memo.html |work=Time |title=The Bombshell Memo: Were Warnings Ignored? |date=May 26, 2002 |accessdate=April 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106215518/http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101020603/memo.html |archivedate=January 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In May 2002 Rowley testified to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the [[9/11 Commission]] about the FBI's pre-9/11 lapses due to its internal organization and mishandling of information related to the attacks.&lt;ref name=pbsnow/&gt; Mueller and Senator [[Chuck Grassley]] ([[U.S. Republican Party|R]]-[[Iowa|IA]]) pushed for and achieved a major reorganization, focused on creation of the new Office of Intelligence at the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;Neil A. Lewis [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/30/national/30INQU.html F.B.I. Chief Admits 9/11 Might Have Been Detectable] The New York Times, 30 May 2002. "...reassigning 400 of the bureau's 11,500 field agents from narcotics investigations to counterterrorism. Another 59 agents would be reassigned to counterterrorism from white-collar crime investigations and an additional 59 from the violent crimes unit."&lt;/ref&gt; This reorganization was supported with a significant expansion of FBI personnel with [[counterterrorism]] and language skills.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In February 2003, Rowley wrote a second open letter to Mueller, in which she warned her superiors that the bureau would not "be able to stem the flood of terrorism that will likely head our way in the wake of an attack on Iraq".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/05/politics/full-text-of-fbi-agents-letter-to-director-mueller.html|title=Full Text of F.B.I. Agent's Letter to Director Mueller|date=2003-03-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2003, Rowley stepped down from her legal position to return to being a FBI Special Agent. At the end of 2004 she retired from the FBI after serving for 24 years.&lt;ref name=pbsnow/&gt;

====Honors and awards====
Rowley jointly held the ''[[Time magazine|TIME]]'' "[[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Person of the Year]]" award in 2002 with two other women credited as whistleblowers: [[Sherron Watkins]] from [[Enron]] and [[Cynthia Cooper (accountant)|Cynthia Cooper]] of [[WorldCom]].&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Ripley and Maggie Sieger [http://content.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1003988,00.html Coleen Rowley: The Special Agent] TIME Magazine, 30 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
She also received the 2002 [[Sam Adams Award]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaun Walker [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/10/edward-snowden-first-photo-russian-asylum Edward Snowden: first photo appears since Russian asylum granted] The Guardian, 10 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political===
[[File:Coleen Rowley 17 Sep 2006.jpg|right|thumb|Coleen Rowley at her rally in [[Rosemount, Minnesota]] on September 17, 2006]]
[[File:John Murtha at Coleen Rowley rally 17 Sept 2006.jpg|right|thumb|US Rep. [[John Murtha]] (D-PA) endorsing Rowley at a rally in [[Rosemount, Minnesota]] on September 17, 2006]]
[[File:Coleen Rowley rally protesters 17 Sept 2006.jpg|right|thumb|Protestors at her rally in [[Rosemount, Minnesota]] on September 17, 2006]]

In May 2005, Rowley announced that she was considering running against incumbent Representative [[John Kline (politician)|John Kline]] for [[Minnesota]]'s 2nd District seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2006. At the time of her announcement, she had been living in [[Apple Valley, Minnesota]] for 15 years. Rowley had formerly voted and identified as a Republican, but on June 27, 2005, she announced that she was entering the race as a [[Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party|DFL]]er, and on July 6 officially kicked off her campaign at her home.&lt;ref name=mpr&gt;Mark Zdechlik [http://www.mprnews.org/story/2006/07/26/seconddistrict Kline, Rowley provide clear choice on Iraq] Minnesota Public Radio, 26 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 2005, Rowley attended a vigil in [[Crawford, Texas]], outside President [[George W. Bush|George W. Bush's]] ranch requesting that the president meet with [[Cindy Sheehan]] to answer Sheehan's questions about the [[War in Iraq]] and the death of Sheehan's son, Casey.&lt;ref name=mpr/&gt;

On January 3, 2006, an unauthorized professionally retouched image appeared on Rowley's campaign website. This image depicted Kline, a retired [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] colonel, as [[Colonel Klink]] from ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]''. Kline objected to the photo, and the Rowley campaign removed the image the same day and initiated an investigation. Rowley apologized quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Gordon|first=Greg|title=Rowley issues apology to Rep. John Kline over his depiction on website|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=2006-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative [[John Murtha]] (D-[[Pennsylvania|PA]]) endorsed Rowley. He visited the district during the campaign and held a rally for Rowley at the local [[Veterans of Foreign Wars|VFW]] in Rosemount, while veterans protested outside. The Rowley campaign subsequently focused efforts on veterans' groups and others with direct experience of the war in Iraq. Financing her campaign proved difficult. Opposing an incumbent [[conservative]] such as Kline in a conservative district did not attract money from the most robust Democratic resources, such as the [[Democratic National Committee|DNC]].&lt;ref name=PioneerPress&gt;{{cite web|last=Melo|first=Frederick|title=What's a Rowley lawn sign go for?|work=TwinCities.com|publisher=St. Paul Pioneer Press|date=2006-12-19|url=http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/16270077.htm|accessdate=2006-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kline's campaign achieved a 2–1 advantage in raising funds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Meggen|first=Lindsay|title=Kline leads Rowley in fundraising, 2-1|publisher=St. Paul Pioneer Press|date=2006-11-03|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?s_site=twincities&amp;p_multi=PD%7C&amp;p_product=PD&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_text_search-0=kline%20AND%20rowley&amp;s_dispstring=kline%20rowley%20AND%20date(last%20180%20days)&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=-180qzD&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no|accessdate=2007-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he easily retained his seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebling |first=Garrett|title=Kline wins easily over foe Rowley |work=Faribault Daily News |date=2006-11-08|url=http://www.southernminn.com/faribault_daily_news/archives/article_d8b0e95a-350f-5390-bfa5-a520bdd6e9c8.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil liberties and peace activism===
Since 2003 Rowley has spoken publicly on ethics and ethical decision-making to various groups.&lt;ref name=ui04&gt;University of Iowa News Service [http://news-releases.uiowa.edu/2004/february/020904rowley-talk.html Rowley To Discuss Patriot Act, Ethics At UI Lectures] University of Iowa, 9 February 2004&lt;/ref&gt; She is a writer and blogger.

'''Edmund Zygfryd Trebus''' (11 November 1918 – 29 September 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Edmund Trebus (Obituary)|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1409049/Edmund-Trebus.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=4 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[compulsive hoarding|compulsive hoarder]], who came to fame when he was featured on the British television documentary series ''[[A Life of Grime]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Edmund Trebus (Obituary)|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23522546.html|accessdate=1 February 2013|newspaper=The Herald (Glasgow)|date=7 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Edmund Trebus was born in Ostrowo, near Danzig ([[Gdańsk]]), Germany, on 11 November 1918 – the day of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice]].

When [[Nazi Germany]] invaded Poland in 1939 Trebus was [[Conscription|conscripted]] into the [[Wehrmacht]]. He was then captured and served with the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces in Italy, in an [[Anti-tank warfare|anti-tank]] unit of the [[II Corps (Poland)|II Corps]] of the Polish armed forces, which was under British command.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|first=Duncan|title=Obituary of Edmund Trebus|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/oct/05/guardianobituaries|work=The Guardian|accessdate=8 August 2011|location=London|date=5 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving to England just after the [[World War II|Second World War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steketee|first=Gail|title=Stuff: Compulsive Hoarding and the Meaning of Things|year=2010|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|pages=270–271|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AZSYFdxaLikC&amp;lpg=PA270&amp;dq=%22Edmund%20Trebus%22&amp;pg=PA270#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Edmund%20Trebus%22&amp;f=false|author2=Randy Frost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trebus married Jozefa Noga in 1949. He and his wife had five children. After Trebus's wife died, his children seldom visited.

Trebus had been "a collector" all his life and he was often seen pushing a hand cart filled with his latest acquisitions, which he would carefully sort into separate piles in his garden and home. One of Trebus's major loves was [[Elvis Presley]], and he managed to collect and store away a copy of almost every single record recorded by the artist.

In his eighties, living alone in a run-down house in [[Crouch End]] in north London, he was constantly in trouble with the [[environmental health]] department of the [[London Borough of Haringey]], because of complaints about the rubbish surrounding his home. He lived in a tiny area on the ground floor in his house, surrounded by piles of rubbish, because he never threw anything away. In the [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[A Life of Grime]]'', Trebus was repeatedly shown arguing with council workers who had been instructed to clear his house of the {{Convert|515|cuyd|abbr=on}} of rubbish it contained. He was eventually re-housed at the Trentfield Nursing Home in Southgate,&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; where he died at the age of 83. Following his death, the BBC broadcast an hour-long tribute, ''Mr Trebus: A Life of Grime''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Famously dirty old man wins BBC 1 tribute|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/famously-dirty-old-man-wins-bbc-1-tribute/1160209.article|accessdate=1 February 2013|newspaper=Broadcast|date=9 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elmo Patrick "Pat" Sonnier''' (February 21, 1950 &amp;ndash; April 5, 1984) was a convicted American murderer and rapist in Louisiana who was executed by [[electric chair|electrocution]] at [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] in [[Louisiana]] on April 5, 1984.  Sonnier was sentenced to death and his younger brother, Eddie, to life on April 25, 1978, for the November 5, 1977, rape and murder of Loretta Ann Bourque, 18, and the murder of David LeBlanc, 17.  

Sister [[Helen Prejean]] was asked to write to death row inmates as part of her Order's community outreach program and happened to write to Sonnier. She became his spiritual adviser and eventually wrote ''[[Dead Man Walking (book)|Dead Man Walking]]'' (1993) about her experience and her belief that the death penalty was morally wrong. 

==Crime==
On November 4, 1977, 17-year-old David LeBlanc and his girlfriend 18-year-old Loretta Ann Bourque attended the Homecoming football game at [[Catholic High School (New Iberia, Louisiana)|Catholic High School]] in [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana]]. After the game, the couple drove to an isolated area in [[St. Martin Parish]], a type of [[lovers' lane]]. At around 1 a.m., the couple were approached by two men, 27-year-old Elmo Patrick "Pat" Sonnier and his younger brother, 20-year-old Eddie James Sonnier. The brothers had been in the area hunting rabbits and were armed with 22-caliber rifles.

The Sonniers identified themselves as police officers and presented a badge that one of the brothers acquired while working as a security guard. The brothers entered LeBlanc's car. They told the couple that they were trespassing on private property and were under arrest. The brothers took LeBlanc's and Bourque's driver's licenses, handcuffed the couple, and moved them to the back seat. They then told the couple that they were going to drive them to the home of land's owner to see if the owner wished to press trespassing charges. 

The Sonniers drove the couple to an oilfield in [[Iberia Parish]] and parked by the road. They handcuffed LeBlanc to a tree in a nearby wooded area. They took Bourque from the car and Elmo raped her. The brothers told her they would release both her and LeBlanc unharmed if she had sex with Eddie James Sonnier. Bourque agreed. Afterward, the brothers took the couple back to the car and removed their handcuffs. Elmo Sonnier decided against releasing them, as he feared the couple would report the incident and he would be reincarcerated at [[Louisiana State Penitentiary|Angola]]. The brothers forced the couple to lie face down in a ditch and fatally shot them several times. 

The brothers returned LeBlanc's car to St. Martin Parish. When they reached Elmo's 1961 [[Dodge Dart]], they discovered they had a flat tire. They used a [[Jack (device)|jack]] from LeBlanc's car to change their tire. The jack was later found in Elmo Sonnier's car. The following day, the brothers disposed of LeBlanc's and Bourque's driver's licenses and buried the weapons they used in the killings.

==Arrests==
The Sonnier brothers were arrested on December 5, 1977. Elmo voluntarily confessed to police that he abducted LeBlanc and Bourque, raped Bourque, and killed both. He made a second statement admitting his guilt while being transported to jail, and a third confession the following day. Police searched his home, where they found handcuffs in his bedroom that had been used to restrain LeBlanc and Bourque. They also found LeBlanc's car jack in Elmo's car. Later they discovered the buried guns that had been used in the murders. A bullet from one of the victims matched the guns, which belonged to the Sonnier brothers; another match was made from casings found at the crime scene. Police located a witness who saw Elmo Sonnier's car in St. Martin Parish.

Both brothers were indicted on two counts of [[first degree murder]]. Elmo Sonnier entered a plea of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity.

==Trial and conviction==
During the trial, the brothers traded accusations as to who did the killings (under Louisiana law, any person who participates in the killing of another human being may be subject to the death penalty, but the extent of participation may be considered when imposing penalty). They were said to have been under the influence of drugs when they committed the crimes. 

In April 1978, Elmo was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Eddie Sonnier was also found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.  After their first appeal, the court reversed their death sentences due to procedural errors. New sentencing hearings were scheduled. During his brother's second penalty hearing, Eddie James Sonnier recanted his previous testimony, claiming that he was responsible for the killings, not his brother. He also sent a letter to Governor [[Edwin W. Edwards]] asserting the same position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court refuses to block child killers execution|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19840405&amp;id=35QsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sfsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6755,1664111|accessdate=April 14, 2014|newspaper=Lakeland Ledger|page=B|date=April 5, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The prosecution attacked the younger brother's credibility, establishing Elmo Sonnier's lead in the crimes and responsibility for the murders. The state of Louisiana again sentenced Elmo to death. Eddie Sonnier was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole because he was a minor at the time of the crime.

==Imprisonment==
While on death row at Louisiana State Prison, Elmo Sonnier was contacted by an outreach effort setting up communication with inmates on Death Row. Sister [[Helen Prejean]], a Catholic nun, was assigned to him. After they started a correspondence, she began to visit him and became his spiritual adviser. He was the first of many death row inmates whom she counseled. Sr. Prejean subsequently became a nationally prominent [[anti-death penalty]] activist.&lt;ref name=grissom&gt;{{cite web|last=Grissom|first=Ken|url=http://www.techetoday.com/news-local/sonnier-brother-dies-angola|title=Sonnier Brother Dies At Angola|website=techetoday.com|date=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sister Helen Prejean later said that the younger brother, Eddie Sonnier, was guilty of killing LeBlanc and Bourque. She claimed that Elmo was innocent but he felt guilt over his criminal past and for participating in the rape of not only Bourque, but other teenage girls at "lover's lane", who had come with their boyfriends. The two brothers had frequently posed as police officers and accosted such couples. They offered to let them go if the girl had sex with both brothers. Elmo told Prejean that he and his brother had pulled the same ruse the night they encountered LeBlanc and Bourque, but his brother lost control and killed the teens.

==Execution and burial==
[[File:AngolaLAPrison.jpg|thumb|[[Louisiana State Penitentiary]], where Sonnier was imprisoned and executed]]
Sonnier's execution date was set for April 5, 1984. On April 4, Sonnier's lawyer attempted to get a [[stay of execution]] from the United States Supreme Court, claiming that a former cellmate of Eddie Sonnier's had overheard him confess to the murders. The Supreme Court rejected the request despite information that suggested the wrong person was being executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Last Minute Appeals Fail; Executions Still On Schedule|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1870&amp;dat=19840405&amp;id=HEcuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tskEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2782,2417870|accessdate=April 15, 2014|newspaper=Daytona Beach Sunday News-Journal|page=2A|date=April 5, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sister Helen Prejean, Elmo Sonnier's spiritual adviser, was permitted to visit with Sonnier during his final hours and to witness his execution. Godfrey Bourque and Lloyd LeBlanc, the fathers of Loretta Bourque and David LeBlanc, respectively, were also granted permission to witness the execution.&lt;ref name=hodge&gt;{{cite web|last=Hodge|first=James|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/angel/articles/timespicayune46.html|title=Sonnier Brother Dies At Angola|website=pbs.org|date=April 6, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[execution chamber]], Sonnier directed his [[last words|last statement]] to Lloyd LeBlanc, saying "I can understand the way you feel. I have no hatred in my heart. As I leave this world, I ask God to forgive...me for what I did.  I also ask your forgiveness for what I did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elder|first=Robert K.|title=Last Words of the Executed|date=2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-20269-0|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; LeBlanc nodded, and then Bourque remarked quietly "He didn't ask me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Killers contrite before executions|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19840406&amp;id=55QsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sfsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4266,2671603|accessdate=April 14, 2014|newspaper=Lakeland Ledger|page=1A|date=April 6, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonnier was strapped in what was known as "[[Gruesome Gertie]]", the state's oak [[electric chair]].&lt;ref name=bulletin&gt;{{cite news|title=Pair of killers dies in state executions|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&amp;dat=19840405&amp;id=mHAoAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HIcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6246,4664262|accessdate=April 14, 2014|newspaper=The Bulletin|page=1|date=April 5, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; After electrical currents were administered, Elmo Patrick Sonnier was pronounced dead at 12:15 a.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La.

It was the first time since 1976 that two convicts were executed on the same day in the United States.&lt;ref name=bulletin/&gt;

Sr. Prejean and other [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] nuns took responsibility to ensure a proper Catholic burial for Elmo Sonnier.  The service, presided over by the bishop of Baton Rouge, [[Stanley Joseph Ott]], was held at a Baton Rouge-area funeral home. Sonnier was buried in Roselawn Memorial Park, in a burial plot normally reserved for nuns.&lt;ref name=hodge/&gt; Eddie James Sonnier died in December 2013 at the age of 57, after a short illness, at Louisiana State Prison . He is buried in the prison cemetery.&lt;ref name=grissom/&gt;

==In popular culture==
Sister Helen Prejean published a book, ''[[Dead Man Walking (book)|Dead Man Walking]]'' (1993), about her relationship with Elmo Sonnier and [[Robert Lee Willie]], another inmate on Death Row whom she counseled. The book was adapted as a 1995 [[Dead Man Walking (film)|film of the same name]] directed by [[Tim Robbins]] and starring [[Susan Sarandon]] as Sister Prejean and [[Sean Penn]] as Matthew Poncelett, an amalgam of Sonnier and Willie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/angel/reporternote.html|title=LOUISIANA: A MURDER, A MOVIE AND A WINK|publisher=PBS|date=|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her book was also adapted as an opera of the same name, first produced in 2000 by the [[San Francisco Opera]].

[[File:Frederic-Clay-ILN.jpg|right|thumb|Frederic Clay]] 
'''Frederic Emes Clay''' (3 August 1838 – 24 November 1889) was an English composer known principally for his music written for the stage. Clay, a great friend of [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s, wrote four [[comic opera]]s with [[W. S. Gilbert]] and introduced the two men.

While working as a civil servant in the Treasury department, Clay began composing seriously in the early 1860s.  His first big success was ''[[Ages Ago]]'' (1869), a short comic opera with a libretto by [[W. S. Gilbert]], for the small [[Gallery of Illustration]].  Other pieces with Gilbert and others followed, and Clay turned to composing full-time after his father died in 1873.  That year, he composed a successful opera-bouffe version of ''[[The Black Crook]]'' for the [[Alhambra Theatre]].  Clay's last piece with Gilbert was  ''[[Princess Toto]]'' (1875).  He also composed two [[cantata]]s.  His last two works were both successful operas composed in 1883, ''The Merry Duchess'' and ''The Golden Ring''.  He then suffered a stroke that paralysed him at age 44.

==Life and career==
Clay was born in Paris&lt;ref name="TBDP1"&gt;"Death of Sir Frederic Clay", ''The Birmingham Daily Post'', 29 November 1889, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; to English parents, [[James Clay (author)|James Clay]] (1804–1873), a member of parliament, and his wife, Eliza Camilla Woolrych.  Clay was the fourth of six brothers and sisters.  His father was celebrated as a player of [[whist]] and the author of a treatise on that subject, as well as an amateur composer.  His mother also had a musical background, as her mother had been an opera singer.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Knowles, Christopher.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5559 "Clay, Frederic Emes (1838–1889)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 10 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Clay was educated at home by private tutors in London, studying piano and violin, and then music composition under [[Bernhard Molique]] and, in 1863, with [[Moritz Hauptmann]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany.&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;Sullivan, Arthur.  [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gilbert/plays/ages_ago/clay.html "Frederic Clay (1838–1889)",] ''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', reprinted at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a civil servant in the Treasury department while also pursuing composing.&lt;ref name="ERA1"&gt;"Death of Mr Frederic Clay", ''The Era'', 30 November 1889, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of his father in 1873, his inheritance enabled him to become a full-time composer.&lt;ref name=Scowcroft&gt;Scowcroft, Philip L.  [http://www.musicweb-international.com/garlands/101.htm A 101st Garland of British Light Music Composers], Classical Music Web, MusicWeb-International.com&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of some songs, hymns, instrumental pieces and two [[cantata]]s, his compositions were nearly all written for the stage.  In the mid-1860s, Clay and his friend [[Arthur Sullivan]] became frequent guests at the home of [[John Scott Russell]].  By about 1865, Clay became engaged to Scott Russell's youngest daughter Alice, and Sullivan wooed the middle daughter Rachel.  The Scott Russells welcomed the engagement of Alice to Clay, but he broke it off.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 87; Jacobs, p. 53.  The Scott Russells forbade the relationship between Sullivan and Rachel, because Sullivan had uncertain financial prospects, although Rachel continued to see him covertly.  At some point in 1868, Sullivan started a simultaneous (and secret) affair with the eldest daughter, Louise, but both relationships had ceased by early 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
[[File:Ages Ago.png|left|thumb|300px|A scene from ''[[Ages Ago]]'' in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'']]
Clay wrote his first short play for the amateur stage in 1859 called '''The Pirate's Isle'', and completed the short comic play ''Out of Sight'' the following year.&lt;ref name="ERA1"/&gt; His first professionally produced piece was an opera entitled ''Court and Cottage'', with a libretto by [[Tom Taylor]], which was produced at [[Covent Garden Theatre]] in 1862.  In 1865, for the same theatre, he composed another opera, the unsuccessful ''Constance'' (1865), with a libretto by [[Thomas William Robertson]].&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, p. 16, says: "Constance was written to a rather 'heavy' libretto. ... It was a tale of love and patriotism set in Poland under the Russians – something of a Polish ''Tosca'', but with a happy ending when the hero and heroine are rescued first by a singing [[vivandiere]] and then by the Polish army. The music ... was noted as being promising if rather light and, after being performed eighteen times as a curtain-raiser to the Covent Garden pantomime of ''Cinderella'', it sank into obscurity."  The score is available at the [[National Library of Scotland]].&lt;/ref&gt; With [[B. C. Stephenson]], he wrote three pieces played by amateurs: ''The Pirate's Isle'', ''Out of Sight'' and ''The Bold Recruit'' (1868), and with [[W. S. Gilbert]] he wrote ''[[Ages Ago]]'' (1869) for [[Thomas German Reed]]'s [[Gallery of Illustration]].&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; This piece ran for 350 performances and was revived several times.&lt;ref name=Scowcroft/&gt; Clay introduced Gilbert to Arthur Sullivan during a rehearsal for ''Ages Ago''.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, Andrew, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/ages_ago/crowther_analysis.html Analysis of Ages Ago] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903092123/http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/ages_ago/crowther_analysis.html |date=3 September 2006 }}, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Bold Recruit'' was revived at a benefit by German Reed at the [[Gallery of Illustration]] in 1870 as a companion piece to ''Ages Ago''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', 24 July 1870, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

These were followed by ''[[The Gentleman in Black]]'' (1870, also with Gilbert), ''In Possession'' (1871, also for German Reed), ''[[Happy Arcadia]]'' (1872, with Gilbert), ''Oriana'' (1873, with a libretto by [[James Albery]]), ''Green Old Age'' and ''Cattarina'' (both 1874, with libretti by [[Robert Reece]]), ''[[Princess Toto]]'' (1875, the last collaboration between Clay and Gilbert), and ''Don Quixote'' (1876).&lt;ref name=Scowcroft/&gt;  ''Ages Ago'' (a one-act piece) and ''Princess Toto'' (a three-act [[comic opera]]) are considered to be among Clay's most tuneful and attractive works.  ''[[The Times]]'' wrote that the music of ''Princess Toto'' "is probably surpassed by no modern English work of the kind for gaiety and melodious charm."&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;Obituary, ''The Times'', 29 November 1889, p. 5, col. F&lt;/ref&gt;

Clay also composed part of the score for the spectacle ''Babil and Bijou'' (1872, also for German Reed)&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; and the successful opera-bouffe version of ''[[The Black Crook]]'' (1873 based on the same source material as the earlier American musical of the same name and starring [[Kate Santley]]), both of which were produced with success at the [[Alhambra Theatre]].  He also furnished incidental music for a revival of ''[[Twelfth Night]]''.&lt;ref name="ERA1"/&gt;

===Cantatas and later career===
Clay's two cantatas were ''The Knights of the Cross'' (1866) and ''Lalla Rookh'' (containing perhaps Clay's best-known song, "I'll sing thee songs of Araby" and also "Still this golden lull"), which was produced successfully at the Brighton Festival in 1877.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; Clay had difficulty finding work in London and moved to America.  There he met with only mixed success and returned to England in 1881.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; His last works were ''The Merry Duchess'' (1883) at the [[Royalty Theatre]], starring [[Kate Santley]] and in which [[Louie Henri]] also appeared,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qUyGtqatz2gC&amp;pg=PA72 Information about ''The Merry Duchess'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Golden Ring'' (starring [[Marion Hood]]) (1883), both with words by [[G. R. Sims]].  The latter was written for the reopening of the Alhambra, which had been burned to the ground the year before.&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; These shows were both successful and showed an artistic advance upon Clay's previous work.&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, pp. 228 and 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Clay's friend, Sir Arthur Sullivan, wrote: "In all his works Clay showed a natural gift of graceful melody and a feeling for rich harmonic colouring. [His songs included] 'She wandered down the mountain side,' 'Long ago' and 'The Sands of Dee'".&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; Other songs that achieved popularity are "Gipsy John" and "Who Knows".&lt;ref name=Scowcroft/&gt;&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

After conducting the second performance of ''The Golden Ring'' in December 1883, Clay suffered a stroke that paralysed him and cut short his productive life.&lt;ref name="TBDP1"/&gt; In 1889 at the age of 51, he was found drowned in his bath at the home of his sisters in [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Great Marlow]], England, presumably a suicide.  He was buried in [[Brompton cemetery]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

'''Friedrich Wannieck''' (1838 in [[Brno]], [[Austrian Empire]] –1919)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-vankovka.cz/en/history|title=Vaňkovka Gallery: History|publisher=Vaňkovka Gallery|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a prominent and wealthy Austrian/German [[industrialist]] most notable for his successful business ventures and his enthusiastic support for the ''[[Völkisch movement|völkisch]]'' author, pioneer of [[Esotericism in Germany and Austria|Germanic mysticism]] and [[runic]] revivalist, [[Guido von List]]. He is the father of [[Friedrich Wannieck#Family|Friedrich Oskar Wannieck]].

He was an [[Armanist]] and supporter of List's [[Armanen runes]] system. He was also an ardent [[spiritualist]] and a firm believer in the [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|Theosophical]] [[mahatmas]], [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]] and [[Koot Hoomi]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 54 and letter from Friedrich Wannieck to Guido von List, dated 12 December 1919, reproduced in Balzli 1917: 183-186.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:FriedrichWannieckInMünchenBookDeutschMythologischeLandschaftsbilder.jpg|thumb|left| Friedrich Wannieck in München from the book ''Deutsch Mythologische Landschaftsbilder'' by [[Guido von List]]]]
Wannieck founded Friedrich Wannieck &amp; Co. in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albert-gieseler.de/dampf_de/firmen0/firmadet64.shtml|title=Friedrich Wannieck &amp; Co.|publisher=Albert Gieseler|language=German|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also chairman of the [[Prague]] Iron Company and the First [[Brno]] Engineering Company, both major producers of capital goods in the [[Habsburg]] empire. He was also president of the organisation and publishing house '''''Verein "Deutsches Haus"''''' ("German House" Association) in Brno. This was a [[nationalist]] association for German inhabitants of the city, who knew it by the name of ''Brünn'' and felt encircled by the overwhelming [[Czechs|Czech]] population of [[South Moravia]] (Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 37).

In 1888 the ''Verein "Deutsches Haus"'' published an historical work entitled ''Der altdeutsche Volksstamm der Quaden [The Ancient German [[Quadi]] Tribe]'' by [[Heinrich Kirchmayr]]. Wannieck was impressed by the parallels between List's [[clairvoyant]] account of the Quadi and the academic study of Kirchmayr. Between Wannieck and List there developed a regular correspondence that laid the basis of a lasting friendship. The ''Verein "Deutsches Haus"'' later published three of List's works in its own book-series of nationalist studies of history and literature (''ibid.'').

Wannieck's munificence eventually led to the foundation of the ''Guido-von-List-Gesellschaft'' ([[Guido von List Society]]) twenty years later. Around 1905, he and his son Friedrich Oskar were among the signatories to the initial announcement endorsing the formation of the Society. This came to fruition with an official founding ceremony in 1908. The Society's assets came mostly from the Wanniecks, who put up more than 3000 crowns at the inauguration (''ibid.'', 43-44).

'''Friedrich Oskar Wannieck''' (died July 6, 1912) was an Austrian/German and the son of Friedrich Wannieck. He, along with his father, were two of the initial signatories creating the Guido-von-List-Gesellschaft in support of their good friend, Guido von List.

He was an Armanist and supporter of the Armanen runes system.

He was the chief of the cacicazgo of [[Chiefdoms of Hispaniola#Chiefdom of Marién|Marién]], which occupied northwest of the island.

Guacanagaríx received [[Christopher Columbus]] after the [[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]] was wrecked during his first voyage to the [[New World]]. He allowed Columbus to establish the settlement of [[La Navidad]] near his village. The Spanish that remained there were killed by a rival tribe before Columbus returned on his second voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Columbus|first1=Ferdinand|title=The Life of the Admiral Christopher Columbus by his son Ferdinand|date=1959|publisher=Rutgers, The State University|location=New Brunswick|pages=82-86,121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guacanagaríx refused to ally himself with other caciques, who were trying to expel the Spanish from the [[Colony of Santo Domingo]] and many times served as an informant and spy for the Spanish.

'''Harry William Braun III''' (born November 6, 1948) is an [[Americans|American]] [[renewable energy]] consultant, researcher, and political candidate. He was a congressional nominee in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1984#Arizona|1984]] and [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1986#Arizona|1986]], and a [[presidential campaign|presidential candidate]] in [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]], [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012]], and [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016]]. He has published papers on the [[hydrogen economy]], [[solar power]], and [[photobiology]].

== Life and work ==
Braun was born November 6, 1948 in [[Compton, California]]. A graduate of [[Arizona State University]], Braun lived in Arizona for 42 years.  He and his wife Dorothy now reside in [[Canton, Georgia]].  In 2002, Braun was the principal of Mesa Wind LLC, which developed [[wind turbine|wind energy]] (and [[solar energy]]) projects.{{efn | name="ppf" }}

Braun received a bachelor's degree in history and general science from [[Arizona State University]] in 1971.{{efn | name="iahe"}}  Since then, he has done independent research in the fields of energy technologies and resources, photobiology, molecular biology, and protein evolution.{{efn | name="ppf" | {{cite web|url=http://phoenixprojectfoundation.us/News.html|title=Harry Braun, Chairman and Senior Scientist|work=Phoenix Project Foundation|accessdate=20 August 2015}} }}  Braun is an Advisory Board Member of the International Association for Hydrogen Energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iahe.org/advisory.asp|title=Advisory Board of Directors|work=International Association for Hydrogen Energy|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Braun is the founder and senior scientist of the Phoenix Project Foundation (PPF), a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, which advocates for a [[hydrogen economy|hydrogen]]-based energy economy rather than the current [[fossil-fuel]]-based economy. The foundation promotes ideas outlined in Braun's book, ''Phoenix Project'', initially published in 1990 and revised in 2000.{{efn | name="iahe" | {{cite web|url=http://www.iahe.org/advisory.asp?did=46|title=Biography of Harry Braun, Sustainable Partners International|work=International Association for Hydrogen Energy|accessdate=20 August 2015}} }}

==Political campaigns==
Braun has not been elected to office, but was the nominee of the Democratic party for two congressional races in the 1980s.

===Congressional campaigns===
In [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1984#Arizona|1984]], Braun was the Democratic nominee for Congress in the [[Arizona's 1st congressional district|1st congressional district of Arizona]], losing to incumbent Republican congressman [[John McCain]].&lt;ref&gt;"McCain, Braun vie for House seat", by Susan Turley, Tempe Daily News, October 14, 1984, page 1 and A4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"McCain vs, Braun", by Susan Turley, Tempe Daily News, October 23, 1984, page A3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Braun outlines plan for energy mecca", by [unknown], Tempe Daily News, page 3, September 19, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'', "A key element of Braun's energy platform is what he calls the 'Phoenix Project,' a plan to mass produce hydrogen with electrolysis by using solar power to produce the electricity."&lt;ref&gt;"Candidate seeks to halt 'suicide' energy policy: Urges moratorium on atomic weapons to foster research", by Joel Nilsson, The Arizona Republic, September 19, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;  Major political problems of the 1980s that the plan could conceivably address included nuclear weapons, pollution, energy scarcity, and deficit spending.&lt;ref&gt;"The World According to Braun", by Doug MacEachern, The New Times, page 3, September 26, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  Braun received 22% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Statistics of the Presidential and Congressional Election of November 6, 1984|year=1985|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|location=Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1986#Arizona|1986]], Braun ran again, and was again the Democratic nominee for Arizona's 1st congressional district, losing to Republican nominee [[John Jacob Rhodes III|Jay Rhodes]].&lt;ref name = "1986 stats"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/1986election.pdf|title=Statistics of the Congressional Election of November 4, 1986|work=Government Printing Office|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Energy policy in general, and [[solar power]] plus the [[hydrogen economy]] in particular, was again a key platform-plank of Braun's campaign.&lt;ref&gt;"Candidate serious on energy issues", by Max Jennings (Executive Editor), The Mesa Tribune, page A7, May 7, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"1st District candidate says solar energy only answer", by Adrianne/Adrian Flynn, Tempe Daily News, June 3, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"District 1 Democrat finds hope in hydrogen", Adrian/Adrianne Flynn, The Mesa Tribune, Vol. 38, No. 202, page 1, August 19, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Sunshine Man: Braun hopes solar solution stirs District 1 voters", by Don Harris, The Arizona Republic, August 22, 1986, page B1 (Valley &amp; State).&lt;/ref&gt;  Braun also campaigned on a broader set of issues during October 1986, including irrigation and [[Water use#Sectoral distributions of withdrawn water use|water-use policy]].&lt;ref&gt;"Braun broadens appeal, shows promise in District 1 race", by Adrianne/Adrian Flynn, The Mesa Tribune, October 6, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Braun says energy is not his only issue in House campaign", by [unknown], The Arizona Republic (Special Edition), October 10, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"1st District contest heats up after debate", by Adrianne/Adrian Flynn, The Mesa Tribune, October 20, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Braun levels attack on Rhodes over CAP", by [unknown], The Arizona Republic, October 24, 1986. page B1 (Valley &amp; State).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Braun blasts CAP as welfare for rich", Stephen Higgins, Scottsdale Progress, October 23, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  Braun improved on his 1984 performance, and received 29% of the vote.&lt;ref name= "1986 stats" /&gt;

===Presidential campaigns===

====2004====
In 2004, Braun ran an independent campaign for [[President of the United States|President]], with the campaign-slogan of "Making America Energy Independent &amp; Pollution Free with Windship Hydrogen Production Systems."&lt;ref name=wapo2004&gt;{{cite news|last1=Achenbach|first1=Joel|title=A  Show of Hands|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2004/01/13/a-show-of-hands/bf185f6d-e1d3-4d02-90f1-75d47356b957/|accessdate=26 August 2015|work=Washington Post|date=13 January 2014|quote=...turned out to be a ballot with easy-on, easy-off access. Essentially anyone could join the fun. Among those running is Harry Braun (no relation to [Carol Moseby Braun] the former senator), the only candidate whose slogan is "Making America Energy Independent &amp; Pollution-Free with Windship Hydrogen Production Systems."  "I'm talking about making the hydrogen from water," Braun said in a phone interview Sunday. "President Bush wants to make it from coal and nuclear power. That's not clean hydrogen, that's filthy hydrogen, and that's nonrenewable hydrogen."  The Braun plan is to build "windships," which he describes as 500 to 1,000 feet tall, with the "hull" anchored under the sea just off the coast. A large mast would hold wind turbines. A crew, below water, would run the machinery to convert ocean water to liquid hydrogen. Each windship would cost $10 million. How many of these enormous windships would Braun need?  "About a million," he said. The project would cost $6 trillion total, in his estimation.  ... }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Braun's energy policy was distinct from the [[hydrogen economy]] proposed by [[George W. Bush]], in that Braun wanted to generate hydrogen from seawater via electrolysis (using [[renewable energy]]), as opposed to generating hydrogen from coal and [[nuclear power]] plants.&lt;ref name=wapo2004 /&gt;  Braun participated in a Presidential Candidates Forum in 2004 in New Hampshire that was covered by [[C-Span]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?179804-1/lesserknown-presidential-candidates-forum |title=Lesser-Known Presidential Candidates' Forum |author=hosted by [[List of New Hampshire state agencies#C|The New Hampshire Political Library]]&lt;!-- methinks this is at [[St. Anselm College]] --&gt;  |publisher=[[C-SPAN]] |date=January 8, 2004 |quote=Fifteen presidential and two vice presidential candidates spoke... }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012====
Braun did not run in 2008, but did run again in 2012, against incumbent Democratic President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name=DesMoinesRegister&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clayworth|first1=Jason|title=Candidate highlights Trig Palin's Down syndrome at soapbox|url=http://caucuses.desmoinesregister.com/2011/08/19/democrat-highlights-trigg-palin-at-soapbox/|accessdate=26 August 2015|work=[[Des Moines Register]]|date=19 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=philly&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohan|first1=William D.|title=A movement or a street fair?|url=http://articles.philly.com/2011-10-11/news/30267010_1_protester-wall-street-bankers|accessdate=26 August 2015|work=[[philly.com]]|date=11 October 2011|quote=...New York Times columnist, made an unlikely comparison of Zuccotti Park to Egypt's Tahrir Square, bestowing on Occupy Wall Street a degree of gravitas it doesn't yet have.

===Proposed constitutional amendment===
Braun has proposed an amendment to the [[United States Constitution]] which he calls the Democracy Amendment. It reads "We the People, hereby empower the majority of American citizens to approve all laws, federal legislation, presidential executive orders, and judicial decisions that impact the majority of citizens." His plan is for the amendment to be ratified directly by voters through constitutional conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.democracyamendmentusa.net/|title=Home page|work=Democracy Amendment USA|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has made this amendment a focus of past presidential campaigns.&lt;ref name = "DesMoinesRegister" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, "Candidate's call for more direct democracy should be heeded," The Daily Iowan, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, Thursday, July 28, 2011: [http://dailyiowan.lib.uiowa.edu/DI/2011/di2011-07-28.pd]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacob Guntlack''' (1744–1771) was a notorious [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[thief]] and [[impostor]]. He began his thievery in Sweden and [[Finland]] at age fifteen; he was a famous [[criminal]] by the time he was [[capital punishment|executed]] in [[Stockholm]] in front of thousands of spectators. His [[memoirs]], entitled ''Den uti Smedjegårds-häktet nu fängslade ryktbare bedragaren och tjufwen Jacob Guntlacks lefwernes-beskrifning, af honom sjelf författad'', were published the same year, either written by himself in [[prison]], or after [[interview]]s in prison.

'''James, son of Zebedee''' ([[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]]: {{Hebrew|יַעֲקֹב}},   ''[[Jacob (name)|Yaʿqob]]''; [[Biblical Greek|Greek]]: Ἰάκωβος; {{lang-cop|ⲓⲁⲕⲱⲃⲟⲥ}}; died 44&amp;nbsp;AD) was one of the [[Twelve Apostles]] of [[Jesus]], traditionally considered the first apostle to be martyred. Note that the following relationships are approximate. The Hebrew word אח  might be translated as "brother", but could also mean a "cousin", or, a "fellow", meaning a beloved friend. (Giving the parents' names was the best way to make a translation into English clear.)  

The James who was a son of [[Zebedee]] and [[Salome (disciple)|Salome]], thus a brother of [[John the Apostle]],is also called '''James the Greater''' or  '''James the Great'''.  This is to distinguish him from [[James, son of Alphaeus]] (James the Less) and [[James, the one who was perhaps a relative, but also a fellow of Jesus|James the brother or cousin or fellow of Jesus]] (James the Just). James the son of Zebedee is the [[patron saint]] of [[Spain]].  He is the one often identified as [[Santiago (name)|Santiago]].

==In the New Testament==
The son of [[Zebedee]] and [[Salome (disciple)|Salome]], James is styled "the Greater" to distinguish him from the Apostle [[James the Less|James "the Less"]]. He was the brother of John, [[Disciple whom Jesus loved|the beloved disciple]], probably the elder of the two.&lt;ref name=camerlynck&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08279b.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: St. James the Greater|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His parents seem to have been people of means. [[Zebedee]], his father, was a fisherman of the [[Sea of Galilee]], who probably lived in or near [[Bethsaida]], in Galilee, Israel, perhaps in [[Capernaum].  He had some boatmen. Salome, his mother, was one of the pious women who afterwards followed Jesus Christ and "ministered unto him of their substance". [[John the Apostle|John]] was personally known to the high-priest.  He may have had the wherewithal to provide for the Mother of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Camerlynck&gt;{{citation |chapter-url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08280a.htm |author=Camerlynck, Achille |chapter=St. James the Less |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 8 |location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company (retrieved from New Advent) |year=1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is probable that James' brother, John, had not received the technical training of the rabbinical schools.  In this sense, they were unlearned, without any official position among the Jews. According to the social rank of their parents, they must have been men of ordinary education, in the common walks of Jewish life. James is described as one of the first disciples to join Jesus. The [[Synoptic Gospels]] state that James and John were with their father by the seashore when Jesus called them to follow him.{{Bibleref2c|Matt.|4:21-22}}{{Bibleref2c|Mk.|1:19-20}} James was one of only three apostles whom Jesus selected to bear witness to his [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Matthew|17:1-9}}, {{bibleref2|Mark|9:2-8}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|9:28-36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; James and John&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Mark|10:35-45}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or, in another tradition, their mother&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Matthew|20:20-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;) asked Jesus to grant them seats on his right and left in his glory. Jesus rebuked them, and the other ten apostles were annoyed with them. James and his brother wanted to call down fire on a [[Samaritan]] town, but were rebuked by Jesus.{{Bibleref2c|Lk|9:51-6}} The [[Acts of the Apostles]] records that "Herod the king" (traditionally identified with [[Herod Agrippa]]) had James executed by the sword.  He is the only apostle whose martyrdom is recorded in the New Testament. He is, thus, traditionally believed to be the first of the twelve apostles martyred for his faith.{{Bibleref2c|Acts|12:1-2}} Nixon suggests that this may have been caused by James's fiery temper,&lt;ref name=NBD&gt;R. E. Nixon, "Boanerges", in J. D. Douglas (ed.), ''The New Bible Dictionary'' (London: The Inter-Varsity Fellowship, 1963), 1354.&lt;/ref&gt; for which he and his brother earned the nickname ''[[Boanerges]]'' or "Sons of Thunder".{{Bibleref2c|Mark|3:17}} [[F. F. Bruce]] contrasts this story to that of the [[Liberation of Saint Peter]], and notes that "James should die while Peter should escape" is a "mystery of [[divine providence]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[F. F. Bruce]], "Commentary on the Book of the Acts" (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1964), 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The English name "[[James (name)|James]]" comes from the Italian "Giacomo", a variant of "Giacobo" derived from ''Iacobus'' ([[Jacob]]) in [[Latin language|Latin]], itself from the Greek ''Ἰάκωβος'' "Iakōbos", from Hebrew יַעֲקֹב.

Saint James is the [[patron saint]] of [[Spain]] and, according to legend, his remains are held in [[Santiago de Compostela]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. (The name ''Santiago'' is the local evolution of Vulgar Latin ''Sanctu Iacobu'', "Saint James".) The traditional [[pilgrimage]] to the grave of the saint, known as the "[[Way of St. James]]", has been the most popular pilgrimage for Western European Catholics from the [[Early Middle Ages]] onwards, although its modern revival and popularity stems from [[Walter Starkie]]'s 1957 book, ''The Road to Santiago. The Pilgrims of St. James''.&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;New York, E. P. Dutton, 1957, OCLC 28087235; reprinted by the Univ. of California Press in 1965 (OCLC 477436336) and published in Spanish translation in 1958 with the somewhat different title of ''El camino de Santiago: las peregrinaciones al sepulcro del Apóstol'', trans. Amando Lázaro Ros, Madrid, Aguilar, 1958, OCLC 432856567. Both the English original and the translation have been republished.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 237,886 pilgrims registered in 2014 as having completed the final 100&amp;nbsp;km walk (200&amp;nbsp;km by bicycle) to Santiago to qualify for a [[Camino de Santiago#Compostela|Compostela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peregrinossantiago.es/esp/oficina-del-peregrino/estadisticas/?anio=2014&amp;mes=|title=Estadísticas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When 25 July falls on a Sunday, it is a "Jubilee" year (an ''Año Santo Jubilar Compostelano'' or ''Año Santo Jacobeo'') and a special east door is opened for entrance into Santiago Cathedral.

The [[feast day]] of St. James is celebrated on 25 July on the [[liturgical calendar]]s of the [[Roman Catholic]], [[Anglican]], [[Lutheran]] and certain [[Protestant]] churches. He is commemorated on 30 April in the [[Orthodox Christian liturgical calendar]] (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], 30 April currently falls on 13 May of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]). The ''[[national day]]'' of Galicia is also celebrated on 25 July, being St James its patron saint.

==Jerusalem==
The site of martyrdom is located within the [[Cathedral of St. James, Jerusalem|Armenian Apostolic Cathedral of St. James]] in the [[Armenian Quarter]] of [[Jerusalem]]. The Chapel of St. James the Great, located to the left of the sanctuary, is the traditional place where he was martyred, when King Agrippas ordered him to be beheaded (Acts 12:1-2). His head is buried under the altar, marked by a piece of red marble and surrounded by six votive lamps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/sbf/escurs/Ger/07santuarioGiacomoBig.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mission in Iberia and burial at Compostela===
{{see| Camino de Santiago}}
[[File:Santiago.de.Compostela.Catedral.Noche.jpg|thumb|According to Catholic tradition, Apostle James, son of Zebedee, spread Christianity in the Iberian Peninsula. In the year 44, he was beheaded in Jerusalem and his remains were later transferred to Galicia in a stone boat, to the place where stands [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral]].]]
The 12th-century ''[[Historia Compostelana]]'' commissioned by [[bishop]] Diego Gelmírez provides a summary of the legend of St. James, as it was believed at Compostela. Two propositions are central to it: first, that St. James preached the gospel in Iberia, as well as in the Holy Land; second, that after his [[martyrdom]] at the hands of Herod Agrippa, his disciples carried his body by sea to Iberia, where they landed at [[Padrón]] on the coast of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], then took it inland for burial at [[Santiago de Compostela]].

The [[translation (relics)|translation]] of his relics from [[Judea]] to Galicia in the northwest of Iberia was done, in [[legend]], by a series of [[Miracle|miraculous]] happenings: decapitated in Jerusalem with a sword by Herod Agrippa himself, his body was taken up by angels, and sailed in a rudderless, unattended boat to [[Iria Flavia]] in Iberia, where a massive rock closed around his relics, which were later removed to [[Santiago de Compostela|Compostela]].

According to ancient local tradition, on 2 January AD 40, the [[Virgin Mary]] appeared to James on the bank of the [[Ebro River]] at [[Caesaraugusta]], while he was preaching the Gospel in [[Iberia]]. She appeared upon a pillar, [[Nuestra Señora del Pilar]], and that pillar is conserved and venerated within the present [[Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar]], in [[Zaragoza]], Spain. Following that apparition, St. James returned to Judea, where he was beheaded by King [[Herod Agrippa I]] in the year 44.&lt;ref name="chadwick"&gt;{{Citation |last= Chadwick |first= Henry |year= 1976 |title= Priscillian of Avila |publisher= Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{Citation |last= Fletcher |first= Richard A. |year= 1984 |title= Saint James's Catapult: The Life and Times of Diego Gelmírez of Santiago de Compostela |publisher= Oxford University Press |url = http://libro.uca.edu/sjc/sjc.htm |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition at Compostela placed the discovery of the relics of the saint in the time of king [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]] (791-842) and of bishop Theodemir of [[Iria Flavia|Iria]]. These traditions were the basis for the pilgrimage route that began to be established in the 9th century, and the [[shrine]] dedicated to James at [[Santiago de Compostela]], in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] in Spain, became the most famous pilgrimage site in the Christian world. The [[Way of St. James]] is a trio of routes that cross Western Europe and arrive at Santiago through Northern Spain. Eventually James became the [[patron saint]] of Spain.

====Controversy====
James suffered martyrdom{{Bibleref2c|Acts|12:1-2}} in AD 44. According to the tradition of the early Church, he had not yet left Jerusalem at this time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Alexandria]], ''[[Stromata|Stromateis]]'', VI; [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius]], quoted by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' V.xviii)&lt;/ref&gt; An argument supporting this assertion is based on St Paul's [[Epistle to the Romans]], written after AD 44, in which he expressed his intention to avoid "building on someone else's foundation"{{Bibleref2c|Rom.|15:20}} by visiting Spain{{Bibleref2c|Rom.|15:23-24}}, suggesting that he knew of no previous evangelisation in Hispania.

The suggestion began to be made from the 9th century that, as well as evangelizing in Iberia, James' body was brought to and is buried in [[Santiago de Compostela|Compostela]]. No earlier tradition places the burial of St. James in Spain. A rival tradition places the relics of the apostle in the church of [[Saturnin|St. Saturnin]] at [[Toulouse]]; if any physical relics were ever involved, they might plausibly have been divided between the two.

The tradition of Saint James' burial in Compostela was not unanimously accepted, and numerous modern scholars, following [[Louis Duchesne]] and T. E. Kendrick,&lt;ref&gt;"Saint James in Spain", London, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; reject it. (According to Kendrick, even if one admits the existence of miracles, James' presence in Spain is impossible.)   The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1908) registered several "difficulties" or bases for doubts of this tradition, beyond the late appearance of the legend:
{{quote|Although the tradition that James founded an apostolic see in Iberia was current in the year 700, no certain mention of such tradition is to be found in the genuine writings of early writers nor in the early councils; the first certain mention we find in the ninth century, in [[Notker of St Gall|Notker]], a monk of [[Abbey of St. Gall|St. Gall]] (''Martyrologia'', 25 July), [[Walafrid Strabo]] (''Poema de XII Apostoli''), and others.}}

The [[Bollandist]]s, however, defended it. (Their ''[[Acta Sanctorum]]'', July, VI and VII, gives further sources.) A belief in the authenticity of the relics at Compostela was also asserted by [[Pope Leo XIII]], in his 1884 [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Omnipotens Deus]]''.

===Medieval "Santiago Matamoros" legend===
{{main|Saint James Matamoros}}
[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - St Jacobus in Budapest.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint James as the Moor-killer by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] ([[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]], [[Budapest]]). His mantle is that of his military order.]]

An even later tradition states that he miraculously appeared to fight for the Christian army during the legendary [[battle of Clavijo]], and was henceforth called ''Santiago Matamoros'' (Saint James the [[Moors|Moor]]-slayer). ''[[Santiago y cierra España|¡Santiago, y cierra, España!]]'' ("St. James and strike for Spain") was the traditional [[battle cry]] of medieval Spanish (Christian) armies. [[Cervantes]] has [[Don Quixote]] explaining that "the great knight of the russet cross was given by God to Spain as patron and protector".&lt;ref&gt;Don Quixote, 2nd section, chapter 58&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar miracle is related about [[Emilian of Cogolla|San Millán]]. The possibility that a cult of James was instituted to supplant the Galician cult of [[Priscillian]] (executed in 385) who was widely venerated across the north of Iberia as a martyr (at the hands of the local bishops, rather than as a heretic) should not be overlooked. This was cautiously raised by Henry Chadwick in his book on Priscillian;&lt;ref name="chadwick"/&gt; it is not the traditional Roman Catholic view. The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' of 1908, however, is quite cautious about the origins of the cult (see above at [[#Controversy|"Controversy"]]).

===Emblem===
[[File:Cross Santiago.svg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Cross of Saint James]], the symbol of the [[Order of Santiago]]; the hilt is surmounted with a scallop.]]
James' emblem was the [[Shell of Saint James|scallop]] shell (or "cockle shell"), and pilgrims to his shrine often wore that symbol on their hats or clothes. The French used it  for a scallop is ''coquille St. Jacques'', which means "cockle (or mollusk) of St. James". The German word for a scallop is ''Jakobsmuschel'', which means "mussel (or clam) of St. James"; the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word is ''Jacobs schelp'', meaning "the shell of St. James".

===Military Order of Santiago===
The military [[Order of Santiago]], named after James, was founded in Spain in the 12th century to fight the [[Moors]]. Later, as in other [[orders of chivalry]], the membership became a mark of honor.

==Congo==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}
James had a special place in the [[Central Africa]]n [[Kingdom of Kongo]], because of his association with the founding of Christianity in the country in the late 15th century.  Portuguese sailors and diplomats brought an appreciation of the saint to Kongo when they first reached the country in 1483.  When King [[Afonso I of Kongo]], whose Kongo name was Mvemba a Nzinga, the second Christian king, was facing a rival, his brother Mpanzu a Kitima, in battle, he reported that a vision of Saint James and the Heavenly Host appeared in the sky, frightened Mpanzu a Kitima's soldiers, and gave Afonso the victory.  As a result, he declared that Saint James' feast day (25 July) be celebrated as a national holiday.

Over the years, Saint James day became the central holiday of Kongo.  Taxes were collected on that day, and men eligible for military duty were required to appear armed.  There were usually regional celebrations, as well as one at the capital.  In some cases, Kongolese slaves carried the celebration to the New World.  There are still celebrations of Saint James Day in Haiti and Puerto Rico.

==Latter-day Saints==
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) teaches that James has been resurrected and that in 1829 he—along with the resurrected [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and the [[Translation (Mormonism)|translated]] [[John the Apostle|John]]—visited [[Joseph Smith]] and [[Oliver Cowdery]] and restored the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] authority with [[apostolic succession]] to earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]] [http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/27.12?lang=eng#11 27:12].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jewish and Christian traditions, '''Jannes and Jambres''' (Hebrew: יניס Yoḥanai, ימבריס ''Yambres'') are the names given to magicians mentioned in the [[Book of Exodus]]. This naming tradition is well-attested in ancient and medieval literature. In Latin manuscripts of the New Testament, and in Latin writing traditions, their names are known as Jamnes and Mambres.&lt;ref&gt;https://academic.oup.com/jts/article-abstract/os-XL/3/257/1658798/ON-THE-FORM-MAMBRES-IN-THE-LATIN-VERSIONS-OF-2?redirectedFrom=PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hebrew Bible ==
Jannes and Jambres are not specifically mentioned in the [[Tanakh]] ("[[Hebrew Bible]]"), but the Egyptian "wise men and [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]]" (two of whom were identified with Jannes and Jambres in Jewish and Christian traditions) are mentioned in Exodus 7:10-12 ([[KJV]])
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And [[Moses]] and [[Aaron]] went in unto [[Pharaoh]], and they did so as the [[YHWH|LORD]] had commanded: and Aaron cast down his [[Aaron's rod|rod]] before Pharaoh, and before his [[servants]], and it became a [[Snake|serpent]]. Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the [[magician (paranormal)|magicians]] of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their [[Incantation|enchantments]]. For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==New Testament and Second Temple literature==
The names Jannes and Jambres ([[Koine Greek|Greek]]: Ἰάννης, Ἰαμβρῆς; ''Iannēs, Iambrēs'') appear in [[Second Epistle to Timothy|2 Timothy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-nb|2 Timothy|3:8|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[New Testament]]. [[Origen]] says that there was an [[apocrypha]]l book called ''The Book of Jannes and Jambres'', containing details of their exploits, and that [[Paul the Apostle]] was quoting from it. This book, known as ''The Apocryphon of Jannes and Jambres the magicians'',  exists in some Greek fragments present in the [[Chester Beatty Papyri]] No XVI (which has been edited and translated by Albert Pietersma &lt;ref&gt;Pietersma A.  ''The Apocryphon of Jannes and Jambres''&lt;/ref&gt;), and in an extensive [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]] fragment which was discovered in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Erho |first1=Ted |last2=Krueger |first2=Frederic |last3=Hoffmann |first3=Matthias |date=2016 |title=Neues von Pharaos Zauberern |url=https://www.academia.edu/23852543/Neues_von_Pharaos_Zauberern._%C3%84thiopische_und_koptische_Textzeugen_zum_apokryphen_Text_Jannes_und_Jambres_ |journal=Welt und Umwelt der Bibel |volume=2 |pages=70–72 |access-date=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also probably known to the [[Qumran]] community, since the Qumran community refers to one of the magicians by the name of Jannes.&lt;ref&gt;"For in times past, Moses and Aaron stood in the power of the Prince of Lights, and Belial raised up Yannes and his brother in his cunning when seeking to do evil to Israel the first time." The Dead Sea Scrolls: A New Translation; Michael Wise, The Damascus Document, pg56)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Testament of Solomon]] also refers to the magicians by the name of Jannes and Jambres.

==Greco-Roman Literature==
The name of Jannes as one of the magicians against Moses occurs in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''Natural History'';&lt;ref&gt;http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101063545/http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm |date=2017-01-01 }} XXX&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny refers to Moses and Jannes as famous magicians of antiquity; Pliny's citation is also referred to in [[Apuleius]]. [[Numenius of Apamea]], a [[Neopythagorean]] [[philosophy|philosopher]], called them sacred Egyptian scribes. The Gospel of Nicodemus also refers to the magicians by the name of Jannes and Jambres.

==Rabbinic Literature==
Two "wise men" are referred to by the names "Johana and Mamre" in the Babylonian Talmud in Menachoth 85a.&lt;ref&gt;https://halakhah.com/pdf/kodoshim/Menachoth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; "Jannis and Jambres" are mentioned by name in the [[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan|Targum of Pseudo-Jonathan]] in sections Exodus 1:15,&lt;ref&gt;http://targum.info/pj/pjex1-6.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Exodus 7:10-12,&lt;ref&gt;http://targum.info/pj/pjex6-9.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and Numbers 22:2.&lt;ref&gt;http://targum.info/pj/pjnum22-25.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clontz, T.E. and J., "The Comprehensive New Testament with complete textual variant mapping and references for the Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, Josephus, Nag Hammadi Library, Pseudepigrapha, Apocrypha, Plato, Egyptian Book of the Dead, Talmud, Old Testament, Patristic Writings, Dhammapada, Tacitus, Epic of Gilgamesh", Cornerstone Publications, 2008, p. 680, {{ISBN|978-0-9778737-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judaism|Jewish]] traditions in the [[Targum]]s preserve other [[legend]]ary lore about the pair. They are called the sons of [[Balaam]], the unwitting non-Jewish [[prophet]] of Peor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj206.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also claimed that they converted to Judaism, and that they left Egypt at the Exodus to accompany Moses and the Israelites; however, they perished on the way, either at the [[Red Sea]], or the destruction of the [[Golden Calf]], or at the slaughter of [[Korah]] and his followers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Apart from their opposition to Moses there are other [[Aggadah|aggadic lore]] and legends about Egyptian sorcerers; it was said that during the end of their days they had necessary occult knowledge to embark on a journey to the Jewish [[Jewish eschatology#The world to come|world to come]]. They were not welcomed and the angels of the first few heavens fought them vigorously but they could not evict them due to the potent [[Amulet|talisman]]s that were worn by the wizards. As they entered the fourth heaven they were met by [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]]; legends say that the battle was very evenly balanced, but in the end it was the angels who had to fall back. Upon entering the fifth heaven they were met by none other than [[Metatron]], who did not come at them with defiance or anger, but appeared accommodating, considering the circumstances; after conversing for a short time the angel was successful in convincing Jannes and Jambres to remove their talismans, leaving them thus vulnerable. Metatron was quick to act and threw them out of heaven with a wave of his hand. It is said that they lost all memory of the event after that.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The [[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|"Book of Jasher"]], of which the earliest known copy is from a 16th Century Hebrew printed manuscript (first edition 1552), also refers to the two magicians by the name of Jannes and Jambres.&lt;ref&gt;ed. Parry ''Book of Jasher'' http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/apo/jasher/79.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the film ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)]]'', [[Douglass Dumbrille]] plays Jannes as a constantly-fretting and extremely devout Egyptian Priest of [[Khnum]]. ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'', an animated [[Dreamworks]] film, has [[Steve Martin]] and [[Martin Short]] provide the voices of Hotep and Huy; characters who were based on Jannes and Jambres. In the 2014 film ''[[Exodus: Gods and Kings]]'', [[Indira Varma]] plays an Egyptian high priestess whose character is roughly parallel to the role of Jannes and Jambres.

'''John Major Jenkins''' (1964 – 2 July 2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LAF|id=n95-11019}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American author and independent researcher. He is best known for his works that theorize certain [[astronomical]] and esoteric connections of the [[Maya calendars|calendar systems]] used by the [[Maya civilization]] of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]. His writings are particularly associated with [[2012 millenarianism]] and the development of [[Mayanism]] in contemporary and popular culture, as an outgrowth from the [[New Age]] milieu&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simonandschuster.co.uk/authors/John-Major-Jenkins/410050010|title=John Major Jenkins|website=Simon &amp; Schuster|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He is one of the principal people who have promoted the idea that the ancient [[Maya calendar]] ends on 21 December 2012 and this portended major changes for the Earth{{vague|date=June 2012}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/movies/43132752.html|title=Did the ancient Mayans predict the end of the world?  |last=Dudek |first=Duane |date=April 18, 2009|work=Milwaukee Wisconsin Journal Sentinel |accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E6D71E3FF932A35754C0A9619C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=4|title=The Final Days|last=ANASTAS|first=BENJAMIN |date=July 1, 2007|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|pages=4–6|accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/books/06book.html|title=The End Is Near!

He died on 2 July 2017 from cancer of the kidney at the age of 53.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.letterpressdepot.com/news/2017/8/12/in-memory-of-john-major-jenkins|title=In memory of John Major Jenkins|work=Letterpress Depot|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative view of cosmology==
{{BLP primary sources|date=June 2012}}
Jenkins considered scientific approaches to [[cosmology]] a byproduct of limited thinking.  In ''Tzolkin: Visionary Perspectives and Calendar Studies,'' he writes, "I primarily wish to promote a visionary approach to these matters, as there is much more to the Sacred Calendar than can be seen with the rational intellect," and that these visionary perspectives "can more closely touch the spirit of the calendar" than does the anthropological literature.&lt;ref name=Tzolkin&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=John Major|title=Tzolkin: Visionary perspectives and calendar studies|year=1994|publisher=Borderland Sciences Research Foundation|isbn=0945685165}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

Jenkins also maintained that, in order to accept and understand his cosmological theories, one must also accept the premise that the Mayan kings journeyed to “distant places,” and continuously “renewed” their kingdoms at specific points in the [[Maya calendar]].&lt;ref name=JenkinsCosmo&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=John Major|title=Maya cosmogenesis 2012 : the true meaning of the Maya calendar end-date|year=1998|publisher=Bear|location=Santa Fe, NM|isbn=1879181487}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|322}}  Jenkins is also a supporter of “The Lost Star” theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cruttenden|first=Walter|title=Lost star of myth and time|year=2005|publisher=St. Lynns Press|location=Pittsburgh, PA|isbn=978-0-9767631-1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which extrapolates the existence of a binary companion of the Earth’s sun based on a believed mathematical discrepancies in “earth wobble.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alignment2012.com/thoughtsoncpak-sent-to-heidi5-24.html|title=The Great Year and the Lost Star by John Major Jenkins, May 2006|website=www.alignment2012.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==

Jenkins was interviewed and appears in the film ''Manifesting the Mind'' a film by Andrew Rutajit, executive producer of Bouncing Bear Films.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

[[File:Karol sidon.jpg|right|thumb|Karol Sidon speaking with Czechoslovak president [[Václav Havel]]]]
'''Karol Efraim Sidon''' (born August 9, 1942) is a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[rabbi]], writer and playwright. He is the [[Chief Rabbi]] of the [[Czech Republic]], and former [[Chief Rabbi]] of the city of [[Prague]].

==Life==
Born in Prague during the war, Karol Sidon is a distant relative of rabbi [[Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld]]. His Jewish father Alexander Sidon came from Trnava, where his great-uncle [[Shimon Sidon]] was the first rabbi after a long expulsion of Jews from the city. Alexander was arrested in 1944 and imprisoned by the Gestapo in Pankrác and in Terezin, where he was tortured to death in the same year. Karol was then hidden away in the country until the end of the occupation. Mother raised him alone until 1948 when she remarried a Jew. His stepfather repeatedly escaped from the Terezin ghetto, Kladno mines, from Warsaw, Treblinka and the last of the Soviet gulag.

He began studying at the ''Academy of Musical Art'' in Prague in 1960 where he began writing film scripts, and [[radio play]]s for Czech public radio - [[Český rozhlas]]. Until 1968 he worked as a producer for Czech puppeteer [[Jiří Trnka]]. In the same year, Sidon's first book, which became a cult book "Sen o mém otci" ("'''Dream about my father'''") was published, in which the author deals with his being brought up without his Jewish father Alexander Sidon, who perished in the [[Terezín concentration camp|Terezín]] ghetto (his wife was a Christian). In 1977 he was a signatory to [[Charter 77]]. He received the [[Jiří Kolář]] prize in 1978. He was married to Marcela Třebická, he is the father of the actors Daniel Sidon and Magdalena Sidonová.

In 1983 he emigrated to [[West Germany]] and he studied [[Jewish studies]] at the Heidelberg university. He became ordained as a Rabbi after studying for a time in Israel. He returned to the Czech Republic in 1992, where he became chief rabbi of Prague.

Rabbi Sidon restored the Jewish Orthodox community. To help get invited many young rabbinical families from Israel. He founded the Lauder School (elementary school named Gur Aryeh and a grammar school named Or Chadash), the construction of a mikveh, the establishment of a midrash Tiferet Uzi (named after his teacher Uzi Kalchheim), Beit Din or kosher shop and Certificates.

===Community tensions in Prague===
In 2004 and 2005, Sidon and his supporters had a conflict with city of Prague's Jewish Community Council. This led to Sidon's brief ouster as Chief Rabbi of the city and of his position as rabbi of the city's landmark ''[[Old New Synagogue|Altneuschul]]''. It did not affect his status as Rabbi of the Czech Republic, as he retained support of the Federation of Jewish Communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/2004/07/01/life-religion/features/prague-chief-rabbi-forced-out|title=Prague chief rabbi forced out {{!}} Jewish Telegraphic Agency|website=www.jta.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, 2004, a coalition headed by Tomáš Jelínek succeeded in installing new leadership of the Prague community.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/stand-off-continues-over-prague-jewish-community-head-posting|title='Stand-off' continues over Prague Jewish Community head posting {{!}} Radio Prague|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their goal was to change the way the community worked, being more open to less traditional Jews. In June, in a controversial move, they ousted Sidon from his position as head of the community and its main synagogue, the Altneuschul. Jelinek explained that Sidon failed to fulfill his duties properly, but Sidon and the Roth group countered that the move was politically motivated, and an attempt to change the Orthodox nature of the community's practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/2004/09/16/archive/5764-a-year-of-pain-and-passion-for-jews-across-europe-a-year-of-expansion-brings-new-challenges|title=5764: a Year of Pain and Passion for Jews Across Europe, a Year of Expansion Brings New Challenges {{!}} Jewish Telegraphic Agency|website=www.jta.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/2004/07/02/archive/around-the-jewish-world-in-shake-up-jewish-community-forces-out-chief-rabbi-of-prague|title=Around the Jewish World in Shake-up, Jewish Community Forces out Chief Rabbi of Prague {{!}} Jewish Telegraphic Agency|website=www.jta.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The council appointed the local [[Chabad]] rabbi, an American named Manis Barash, to lead the synagogue, with other communal rabbinic duties split between Barash and two other local rabbis.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/2004/07/19/life-religion/features/controversy-builds-over-prague-rabbi|title=Controversy builds over Prague rabbi {{!}} Jewish Telegraphic Agency|website=www.jta.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sidon took Jelinek to an Israeli rabbinical court.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; It ruled that Barash should continue to head the synagogue, but Sidon claimed that Jelinek gave false testimony, negating the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;'''Little Jerusalem' shul battle heats up'', Lev Krichevsky, Jerusalem Post, April 13, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Others in the community ran a grassroots campaign called ''Community for All,'' to remove the new leadership, over several dismissals and violation of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/2004/11/10/life-religion/features/rift-widens-in-prague-community|title=Rift widens in Prague community {{!}} Jewish Telegraphic Agency|website=www.jta.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A general assembly vote succeeded in November, replacing Jelinek and his group with another group, led by Jakub Roth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/2004/11/08/archive/members-of-pragues-jewish-community-voted-out-the|title=News Brief {{!}} Jewish Telegraphic Agency|website=www.jta.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jelinek refused to leave the office; he and others barricaded themselves in the offices, with hired bodyguards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ouster was confirmed by another vote on December 20. The second vote's validity was contested by Jelinek's group, but the national Federation of Jewish Communities recognized and accepted it in January 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/2005/01/20/life-religion/features/prague-rebels-oust-chairman|title=Prague rebels oust chairman {{!}} Jewish Telegraphic Agency|website=www.jta.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barash continued to lead the synagogue. Deputy chairman of the community Jakub Roth told the press: ''"this is part of the local Chabad's striving to take over the community's religious life. We have seen an ugly foray of Chabad in their attempt to take over the Old-New synagogue."''&lt;ref name="stow"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jta.org/2005/12/09/archive/around-the-jewish-world-stoking-controversy-sidon-is-reappointed-as-prague-chief-rabbi|title=''Around the Jewish World:'' Stoking Controversy, Sidon is Reappointed As Prague Chief Rabbi|last=Spritzer|first=Dinah A|date=2005-12-08|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=2018-03-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 15, 2005 the two factions brawled, when Sidon was offered an honor at the synagogue's Sabbath services, by the ''[[gabbai]]'' Jacob Svab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/2005/04/15/archive/around-the-jewish-world-festering-rivalry-in-prague-bursts-into-open-with-violence-on-shabbat|title=Around the Jewish World Festering Rivalry in Prague Bursts into Open with Violence on Shabbat {{!}} Jewish Telegraphic Agency|website=www.jta.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The synagogue in the ancient Jewish Quarter became the scene of an emotional dispute between members of the Chabad movement and followers of Sidon, who had moved his services to the High Synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.praguepost.com/P03/2005/Art/0421/news5.php ''Jewish conflict turns violent: Community, Chabad vie to control Prague's Old-New Synagogue'', Dinah A.

The Community for All platform won three-quarters of the vote on December 8, while Jelinek's Coalition for a Democratic Community secured three seats on the board. The last three seats went to community members who did not join either group &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/2005/12/08/life-religion/features/leaders-hope-prague-elections-end-strife|title=Leaders hope Prague elections end strife {{!}} Jewish Telegraphic Agency|website=www.jta.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sidon was promptly restored to his position the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/page/3?sp%5Bforce%5D=1&amp;sp%5Bf%5D=2003-01-01&amp;sp%5Bt%5D=2009-03-08&amp;orderby=date&amp;order=asc&amp;s=sidon|title=You searched for sidon - Page 3 of 4 - Jewish Telegraphic Agency|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former trustees==
The [[British Museum Act 1753]] established a 42 strong Board of Trustees, which included two representatives each of the Sloane, Cotton, and Harley families, elected representatives and the following ex-officio:
Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Chancellor, Speaker of the House of Commons, Lord President of the Council, First Lord of the Treasury, Lord Privy Seal, Lord High Admiral, Lord Steward, Lord Chamberlain, the three Principal Secretaries of State, Bishop of London, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Chief Justice King's Bench, Master of the Rolls, Lord Chief Justice Common Pleas, Attorney General, and Solicitor General.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/2.pdf The British Museum chapter 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

This rose to 50 by the mid-1800s, including the addition of a trustee appointed by the Crown ([[British Museum Act 1832]]) and one representative each from the Towneley, Elgin, and Knight families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45210 Walford, E 1878 Old and New London vol.4 chapter 38]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Museum Act 1963]] reduced the number of trustees to the current 25 and set the time-limit on appointments.

'''Ma Yuehan''' ({{zh|c=马约翰}}, 1883–1966) was a pioneer in [[Physical Education|physical education]] and [[Sports in China|modern Chinese sports]]. During his lifetime he was the professor of Physical Education at the [[Tsinghua University]] for 52 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://thsports.tsinghua.edu.cn/english/Training.Asp?action=myh program of students - Teaching and Research Division of Physical Culture Tsinghua University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ma was born in 1882 on [[Gulangyu Island]], [[Xiamen]]. He went on to study [[medicine]] at [[Saint John's University, Shanghai|St. John's University]] and graduated in 1911. In addition, he went to the [[United States]] to further his education.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.amoymagic.com/discovergulangyu5edu.htm Gulangyu - Pioneering Education&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, MA traveled to the United States to earn his BA from [[Springfield College]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdm16122.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15370coll2/id/5027 Springfield College Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating in 1920, he returned to China and was promoted to director of physical education, a position he held for the next nine years. He coached the Tsinghua University [[soccer]] team  to victory in the [[North China]] Championship.

==Career==
In 1914, Ma worked at Tsinghua University as a physical education teacher. In 1926, he went on furlough and returned to Springfield College to earn his master's degree. From 1931 to 1932, he was the physical education director at Soochow University, and in 1934 he returned to his old position at Tsinghua College. In 1936, he coached the Chinese sports delegation to the [[1936 Summer Olympics|11th Olympic Games]]. In 1945, Ma became president of Tsinghua University.

After the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]], he was elected the chairman of the [[All China Athletic Federation]]. This enabled him to play a significant contribution to Chinese sports by creating a system of sports school which recruited talented athletes and provide world class training facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Dingbo Wu, Patrick D.

'''Martin John "Buster" Phillips''' (born 13 March 1976) is an English former professional footballer.

== Life and career ==

Phillips was born in [[Exeter]] and began his football career as a trainee with his local side [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]], turning professional in July 1994. He soon attracted the attention of higher division clubs and moved to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in November 1995 for a fee of £500,000. This remained Exeter's record sale until they sold [[Matt Grimes]] for around £1.75 million in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Matt Grimes: Swansea City sign midfielder from Exeter City|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30632655|accessdate=2 January 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon signing Phillips, City manager [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]] predicted "Buster will be the first British £10 million pound player."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/blogs/football-banter/Rafa-Benitez-Lionel-Messi-Terry-Venables-Kevin-Keegan-and-the-worst-football-predictions-ever-article351893.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He struggled to establish himself at Maine Road and was loaned to [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] in January 1998 and back to Exeter City in March 1998.

He left Maine Road in August 1998, moving to [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] for a fee of £100,000. Again he struggled to establish himself and spent a month on loan to [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] in February 1999. In August 2000 he returned to [[Devon]], joining [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] in August 2000 for a fee of just £25,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/plymouth_argyle/866488.stm Phillips looks set for Pilgrims]&lt;/ref&gt; He was released at the end of the 2003-04 season, after spending much of the season struggling with injuries.

He joined [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] on a free transfer in July 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/torquay_united/3892411.stm Phillips set for Torquay]&lt;/ref&gt; becoming one of a growing band of former Plymouth players signed by [[Leroy Rosenior]], others including [[Craig Taylor (footballer)|Craig Taylor]], [[Brian McGlinchey]], [[Martin Gritton]] and [[Matthew Villis]].

In November 2006, the BBC linked him with a possible move back to Exeter City, by now a [[Conference National]] side,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/e/exeter_city/6149898.stm Exeter keen to re-sign Phillips]&lt;/ref&gt; but the move fell through and Phillips remained at [[Plainmoor]]. He failed to appear again for Torquay and in May 2007 he was forced to retire due to suffering [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/torquay_united/6665703.stm Torquay's Phillips hangs up boots]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Livermore''', born '''Mary Ashton Rice''', (December 19, 1820 &amp;ndash; May 23, 1905) was an American [[journalist]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], and advocate of [[women's rights]].  

When the [[American Civil War]] broke out, she became connected with the [[United States Sanitary Commission]], headquarters at [[Chicago]], performing a vast amount of labor of all kinds—organizing auxiliary societies, visiting hospitals and military posts, contributing to the press, answering correspondence, and other things incident to the work done by that institution. She was one of those that helped organize the great fair in 1863, at Chicago, when nearly US$100,000 was raised, and for which she obtained the original draft of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] from [[President Lincoln]], which was sold for $3,000.{{sfn|Hurd|1890|p=215-216}}

When the war was over she instituted a paper called the ''Agitator'', which was afterwards merged in the ''Woman's Journal''. Of this, she was editor for two years and a frequent contributor thereafter. On the lecture platform, she had a remarkable career, speaking mostly in behalf of [[women's suffrage]] and the temperance movements. Many years, she traveled {{convert|25000|miles}} annually, speaking five nights each week for five months of the year.{{sfn|Hurd|1890|p=215-216}}

Her printed volumes included: ''Thirty Years Too Late,'' first published in 1847 as a prize temperance tale, and republished in 1878 ; ''Pen Pictures; or, Sketches from Domestic Life'', ''What Shall We Do with Our Daughters? Superfluous Women, and Other Lectures'', ''My Story of the War. A Woman's Narrative of Four Years' Personal Experience as Nurse in the Union Army, and in Relief Work at Home, in Hospitals, Camps and at the Front during the War of the Rebellion''. For ''Women of the Day'', she wrote the sketch of the sculptress, Miss Anne Whitney; and for the ''Centennial Celebration of the First Settlement of the Northwestern States, at Marietta, Ohio, July 15, 1788'', she delivered the historical address.{{sfn|Hurd|1890|p=215-216}}

==Early years and education==
Mary Ashton Rice was born in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]] on December 19, 1821 to Timothy Rice and Zebiah Vose (Ashton) Rice.&lt;ref name= ERA&gt;Edmund Rice (1638) Association, 2010.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a direct descendant of [[Edmund Rice (1638)|Edmund Rice]], an early [[Puritan]] immigrant to [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].&lt;ref name= ERA /&gt;  Livermore came from a military family: her father fought in the [[War of 1812]] and her mother was a descendant of Captain Nathaniel Ashton of London.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last=Holland|first=Mary G.|title=Our Army Nurses: Stories from Women in the Civil War|location=Roseville|publisher=Edinborough|ISBN=9781889020044|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livermore was incredibly intelligent, graduating from Boston public schools at age 14.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Because there were no public high school or college options for women of that time, she attended [[Charlestown Female Seminary (Massachusetts)|school]] at an all-[[female seminary]] in [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]], [[Massachusetts]], and read the entire [[Bible]] every year until the age of 23. 

==Career==
After graduating from the seminary in 1836, she stayed there as a teacher for two years. In 1839, she started a job as a tutor on a Virginia plantation, and after witnessing the cruel institution of [[slavery]], she became an abolitionist. She also began work with the [[temperance movement]] at this time, identified with the Washington Temperance Reform and an editor for a juvenile temperance paper.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 1842, she left the plantation to take charge of a private school in [[Duxbury, Massachusetts]], where she worked for three years. She also taught at [[Charlestown, Massachusetts]].{{sfn|Hurd|1890|p=215-216}}

She married Daniel P. Livermore, a [[Universalist Church of America|Universalist]] minister in May 1845,&lt;ref name= ANB /&gt; and in 1857, they moved to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]. In that year, her husband established the ''New Covenant'', a Universalist journal of which she became associate editor for twelve years, during which time she frequently contributed to periodicals of her denomination and edited the ''Lily''.{{sfn|Hurd|1890|p=215-216}} 

As a member of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] party, Livermore campaigned for [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the [[1860 presidential election]]. In the Chicago Wigwam in 1860, Livermore was the only woman reporter assigned a location for work amidst over hundreds of male reporters. She published a collection of nineteen essays entitled ''Pen Pictures'' in 1863.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holland|first=Mary|title=Our Army Nurses: Stories from Women in the Civil War|location=Roseville|publisher=Edinborough Press|page=166|isbn=9781889020044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Civil War ===
During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], she volunteered as an associate member of the [[United States Sanitary Commission]] at 40 years old.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tsui|first=Bonnie|title=She Went to the Field: Women Soldiers of the Civil War|location=Guilford|publisher=TwoDot|date=2006|isbn=978-0-7627-4384-1|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As agent of its Chicago branch, later named the Northwestern branch, she attended a council of the National Sanitary Commission at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] in December 1862, organized many aid societies, visited army posts and hospitals, and in 1863, organized the North-western Sanitary Fair in Chicago which raised $86,000.  President Lincoln donated his own copy of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which was auctioned off at $10,000. Livermore eventually became the co-director of the Chicago branch with [[Jane Hoge]], another soldier's aid advocate.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The two women completed a hospital inspection tour across Illinois, Kentucky, and Missouri.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tsui|first=Bonnie|title=She Went to the Field: Women Soldiers of the Civil War|location=Guilford|publisher=TwoDot|date=2006|isbn=978-0-7627-4384-1|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a thorough understanding of the needs of the hospitals, Hoge and Livermore sent $1 million worth of food and supplies to hospitals and battlefields most in need.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Livermore, like many other nurses, came up against the issue of women disguised as male soldiers. On a visit to the camp of the 19th Illinois Infantry, a captain pointed out a soldier to Livermore, asking if she noticed anything odd about them.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Richard|title=Women on the Civil War Battlefront|location=Lawrence|publisher=University Press of Kansas|page=130|isbn=9780700614370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livermore confirmed the captain's suspicions that the soldier was indeed a woman. The captain called the soldier for questioning, and though she pleaded to stay in service near her beloved, Livermore escorted her out of camp.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; The soldier escaped Livermore, however, and fled. 

In addition to her nursing services, Livermore was also a prolific writer. She authored numerous books of poetry, essays, and stories, and was a recognized member of the literary guild. Though Livermore had to sacrifice much of her social justice work for nursing, she still managed to publish some kind of content once a week throughout the entirety of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brockett|first1=L.P.|last2=Vaughan|first2=Mary|title=Woman's Work in the Civil War: a Record of Heroism, Patriotism and Patience|location=Philadelphia|publisher=Zeigler, McCurdy and Company|year=1867|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-war life ==
[[File:Mary Livermore 1901.jpg|thumb|upright|Mary Livermore, 1901]]
After the war, Livermore devoted herself to the promotion of [[women's suffrage]] (along with [[Lucy Stone]] and [[Julia Ward Howe]] ) and the [[temperance movement]], founding in Chicago in 1869 ''The Agitator'', which in 1870, after she moved to [[Boston]], was merged into the ''[[Woman's Journal]]'', of which she was an associate editor until 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iamwoman-mxtodis123.blogspot.com/2010/07/mary-livermore.html |title=I Am Woman: A Celebration of Womanhood |first1=Mary |last1=Livermore |accessdate=January 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livermore became the first president of the Association for Advancement of Women, as well as president of [[American Woman Suffrage Association]].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Like many Universalists of the time, she was interested in [[spiritualism]], and following her husband's death in 1899, she became convinced that he had communicated with her through a medium. Livermore died in [[Melrose, Massachusetts|Melrose]], Massachusetts on May 23, 1905.

==Legacy==
The Mary A. Livermore School in Melrose, operational from 1891 to 1933,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Melrose|date=September 5, 1933|publisher=''[[Boston Globe|Daily Boston Globe]]''|accessdate=January 18, 2018|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an elementary school named for Livermore. In 1943, nearly four decades after her death, she became the namesake of a [[World War II]] [[Liberty ship]], the [[SS Mary A. Livermore|SS ''Mary A. Livermore'']].

[[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] '''Sir Matthew Nathan''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|GCMG|PCi}} (3 January 1862 – 18 April 1939) was a British soldier and colonial administrator, who variously served as the Governor of [[Sierra Leone]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], [[Hong Kong]], [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]] and [[Queensland]]. He was [[Under-Secretary for Ireland]] from 1914 to 1916, and was responsible, with the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland|Chief Secretary]], [[Augustine Birrell]], for the administration of Ireland in the years immediately preceding the [[Easter Rising]].

==Early life and career==
Nathan was born in [[Paddington]], England. He was of [[Jewish]] descent and the second son of businessman Jonah Nathan and Miriam Jacob Nathan. His brothers were Colonel Sir Frederick Nathan, an officer of the [[Royal Artillery]] and sometime Superintendent of [[Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills]], and Sir Nathaniel Nathan, a colonial judge in [[Trinidad and Tobago]].

Nathan was educated at [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich|Royal Military Academy]], [[Woolwich]], where he was the winner of the [[Pollock Medal]] (1880) before being gazetted to [[Royal Engineers]] in 1880. He continued his training at the School of Military Engineering, [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] from 1880 to 1884.

Nathan was sent to military expeditions to [[Sudan]] (1884–1885) and to [[Lushai]], [[India]] (1889–1894). He was promoted to the position of [[Captain (land)|captain]] in 1889 and became the secretary to the Colonial Defence Committee between 1896 and 1898. Nathan was promoted to [[major]] in 1898.

==Colonial Service==
Nathan was appointed acting governor of [[Sierra Leone]] from 1899 to 1900. Late that year, he was appointed as Governor of [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=27245 |page=6854 |date=9 November 1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; a position he occupied until 1903. In 1902, Nathan imported into the Gold Coast a £543 French [[Gardner-Serpollet]], paraffin-fired, [[Steam car|steam-driven car]] for his use on the roads around [[Accra]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon Heap, 'The development of motor transport in the Gold Coast, 1900–39', ''Journal of Transport History'', 1990, pp. 19–37&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, Nathan was appointed as [[Governor of Hong Kong]], a position he would serve until 1907. During his tenure, Nathan was credited with the establishment of a central urban planning and reconstruction policy, which regulated the growth of Hong Kong and built major thoroughfares in the [[Kowloon Peninsula]]. The construction of [[Kowloon-Canton Railway]] started under this period.

In 1907, Nathan was made Governor of [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]] (until 1909). In that same year, he was raised to a higher rank of [[lieutenant colonel]]. In 1909 he returned to [[England]] and took up an appointment as secretary to the [[General Post Office]], a position he served until 1911. He  was chairman of the [[Board of Inland Revenue]] between 1911 and 1914.

==Under-Secretary for Ireland==
Nathan was appointed [[Under-Secretary for Ireland]] in August 1914, just after the outbreak of [[World War I]] and the signing into law of the [[Home Rule Act 1914]].&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, Leon, ''Dublin Castle &amp; the 1916 Rising'', Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, 1970, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; His immediate superior was the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland|Chief Secretary]], [[Augustine Birrell]].  At this time the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] was largely a ceremonial position, and the Chief Secretary spent much of his time in London where he was a member of the cabinet, so the Under-Secretary was effectively the head of the administration in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, Leon, ''Dublin Castle &amp; the 1916 Rising'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Nathan's job involved liaising with the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP) to prepare them for self-government. He was also concerned with recruiting in Ireland, and received regular reports from the police and military about anti-recruiting and pro-independence activity, including the threat of a German invasion or arms landing in support of an Irish rising.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, Leon, ''Dublin Castle &amp; the 1916 Rising'',  pp. 19–23&lt;/ref&gt; Alarmed at the growing numbers of separatists in the Civil Service, Nathan wrote to the authorities to have them transferred to England, and eventually got cabinet approval for a letter warning civil servants that they would be dismissed if they continued as members of the [[Irish Volunteers]].&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, Leon, ''Dublin Castle &amp; the 1916 Rising'',  pp. 32–34&lt;/ref&gt; He used the [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914]] to suppress newspapers he considered seditious, against the advice of the IPP&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, Leon, ''Dublin Castle &amp; the 1916 Rising'', pp. 38–42&lt;/ref&gt; In general, however, he avoided any action that might provoke violence.

On Good Friday, 21 April 1916, Nathan was informed that a German boat had been stopped off the coast of [[County Kerry]] carrying arms and ammunition, and that a man had been arrested after coming ashore from another vessel. The man arrested was subsequently identified as Sir [[Roger Casement]]&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, Leon, ''Dublin Castle &amp; the 1916 Rising'',  p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;  A mobilization of the Irish Volunteers fixed for [[Easter|Easter Sunday]] was cancelled the day before. Nathan, believing that a rising had been averted, discussed with the Lord Lieutenant, [[Ivor Guest, 1st Viscount Wimborne|Lord Wimborne]], the necessity of raiding premises associated with the Irish Volunteers and the [[Irish Citizen Army]] and arresting their leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, Leon, ''Dublin Castle &amp; the 1916 Rising'',  pp. 82–86&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan cabled Birrell, the Chief Secretary, in London to obtain authorisation for these actions.  On Easter Monday, 24 April 1916, while he was in his office in [[Dublin Castle]] awaiting Birrell's response, the [[Easter Rising]] broke out and Dublin Castle itself was attacked.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, Leon, ''Dublin Castle &amp; the 1916 Rising'',  p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;  The Castle gates were closed and the rebels did not press the attack, but Nathan was a virtual prisoner until troops arrived from the [[Curragh Camp]] on Monday evening.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, Leon, ''Dublin Castle &amp; the 1916 Rising'',  p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan remained in the Castle for the rest of the week (being moved to the stables to accommodate the military) where he kept in contact with London, keeping the government up to date with the situation and helping to answer questions in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, Leon, ''Dublin Castle &amp; the 1916 Rising'',  p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  The Rising came to an end on 30 April. The same day Birrell offered his resignation, and on 3 May, at Birrell's request, Nathan also resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, Leon, ''Dublin Castle &amp; the 1916 Rising'',  p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Commission]] on the 1916 Rebellion (the [[Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Hardinge]] commission) was critical of Birrell and Nathan, in particular their failure to take action against the rebels in the weeks and months before the Rising.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, Leon, ''Dublin Castle &amp; the 1916 Rising'',  p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
After his resignation Nathan was appointed secretary to the Ministry of Pensions, a position he held until 1919. In 1920, he was appointed [[Governor of Queensland]] and served in that position until 1925. It was to be his last post in the Colonial Service. During his tenure, Nathan actively promoted British migration to [[Queensland]]. In 1922 he founded, along with [[Henry Caselli Richards]], the [[Great Barrier Reef]] Committee. He was chancellor of the [[University of Queensland]] in 1922-25 and was awarded an honorary LL.D. in 1925. After his appointment as Governor expired, Nathan left Queensland for retirement in [[Somerset]], England. He died in England in 1939.

==Honours==

In [[Australia]], [[Nathan, Queensland|Nathan]] and Nathan Heights in [[Brisbane]] (the capital city of Queensland) and Nathan Street in the [[Canberra]] suburb of [[Deakin, Australian Capital Territory|Deakin]] were named after him.   Nathan House,  a boarding house for Form 2 learners at [[Maritzburg College]] in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa is named in his honour.

'''Mike Fitzgerald''' (born 1951) is a criminologist, former higher education manager and consultant. He was Vice-Chancellor of Thames Valley University in the 1990s.

==Background==
Fitzgerald grew up on [[Merseyside]].He attended Catholic grammar school in [[Crosby, Merseyside]] and gained entry to the University of Cambridge to read Social Sciences, graduating in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.carolinephillips.net/articles/archive/newspapers/evening-standard/meet-mike.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=23 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524222420/http://www.carolinephillips.net/articles/archive/newspapers/evening-standard/meet-mike.html# |archive-date=24 May 2018 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 he was awarded a PhD by the [[University of Leicester]] for ''Prisoners in Revolt'' a study which looked at the attempt by the organisation [[Preservation of the Rights of Prisoners]] to organise prisoners into a union.&lt;ref name="Prisoners in Revolt"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fitzgerald|first1=Mike|title=Prisoners in Revolt|url=https://lra.le.ac.uk/handle/2381/34542|website=Leicester Research Archive|publisher=University of Leicester|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married as a student, later divorced, and has two children. He currently resides in [[Amsterdam]].

==Scholarly work==
Fitzgerald began an academic career in the 1970s at [[Leicester University]] sociology department as a tutorial assistant for two years. In 1975, he went to the [[Open University]], as a lecturer in Social Policy. He helped build the social sciences faculty into one of the best in the UK, persuading [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] and other well known sociologists to take up posts there. He was involved in the OU's innovative teaching modes and joint publications. He was expert in the sociology of prisons and policing in Britain and internationally, publishing several books on these topics&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, M. 1977. ''Prisoners in Revolt''.

==Academic management, and Thames Valley University==
[[File:TVU Walpole House Ealing.jpg|thumb|upright|Walpole House in [[Ealing]], housing the University's administration. Fitzgerald's office was actually in a different building in the 1990s]]
Fitzgerald latterly became Dean and Director of Studies in the Faculty of Social Sciences at the [[Open University]], then left in 1987/8 to become Deputy Director for Academic Development at [[Coventry Polytechnic]].

He was appointed Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive of [[Thames Valley University]] (TVU) in 1991, at 41 years of age the youngest VC in Britain. TVU had been a college of higher education, then became a polytechnic and quickly applied for and received full university status.

His personal characteristics came to define the image and policies of the new university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=416110|title=Leader: Born again in West London|date=12 May 2011|website=Timeshighereducation.co.uk|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was known for his flamboyant style, sporting an earring, peroxide hair, Armani suits and drove a car with an M4TVU numberplate. His office had no desk, but a sofa and a jukebox. He was the first person ever to use a swearword on the front page of ''Times Higher Education'' in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=416073|title=Back from the brink|date=12 May 2011|website=Timeshighereducation.co.uk|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected vice chair of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals in 1996. "At 45 he believes he is the youngest vice chancellor, but after five years at TVU – seeing it through a transformation from institute of higher education to polytechnic to university – he is far from the least experienced. Peer respect for the sharp mind behind a laddish exterior was signalled last week when the CVCP council chose him as vice chair in succession to David Melville of Middlesex University."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=100078&amp;sectioncode=26|title=CVCP gets ahead with a haircut|date=5 July 1996|website=Timeshighereducation.co.uk|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fitzgerald was a passionate advocate for widening participation in higher education. In the mid-1990s, less than a third of eighteen-year-olds went into UK higher education. Fitzgerald used his experience at the Open University and in the polytechnic sector to create a new learning environment to support and sustain a mass system of higher education. As he had experienced at Cambridge and learnt at the Open University, assessment was a key vehicle for teaching itself, and so he argued for continuous, student-driven learning. He envisaged a  "student driven university" led by a "New Learning Environment", which sought to use new media along with some traditional teaching, and whose learning outcomes were career-driven rather than classically academic and disciplinary in nature. He said: "Just as you need students to be active learners, so you need teachers to be active tutors. A lecture-driven model renders both teachers and learners passive." "...education is something you do; it's not something that happens to you. It is an active process".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/html/erm/erm99/erm9967.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=22 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005044201/http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/html/erm/erm99/erm9967.html# |archive-date=5 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He initiated the Paul Hamlyn Learning Resource Centre at the Slough campus (now sold), and introduced new areas of study including courses in performance rock music, and digital technologies, computer animation and games. Though such courses are now commonplace, at the time they were held up as examples of  "[[dumbing down]]" and lowering of standards.

Fitzgerald's changes, while prescient in many ways, were instituted rapidly. They were opposed by the staff union of TVU because they led to negative terms and conditions for employees, and poorer and rapidly changing conditions for academics. There were only two years during his tenure that no industrial action was held. He was frustrated that some academic staff were not on board with his vision of a "New Learning Environment".

Poor relations with some of the teaching staff, combined with the very rapid pace of change and reliance on new computer technologies, created the greatest problems for his management.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=190611&amp;sectioncode=26|title=Former dean spills the beans on TVU's fall from grace|date=13 August 2004|website=Timeshighereducation.co.uk|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scandal over low pass marks for resit exam candidates was quickly redressed by Fitzgerald in October 1997. He also called in  the Quality Assurance Agency. The industrial disputes with staff clearly had a negative impact on meeting marking deadlines, and thus on student progression. The QAA report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/reviews/reports/institutional/TVU98/TVU.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309135257/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/reviews/reports/institutional/TVU98/TVU.asp |archivedate=9 March 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; gave negative evaluations of TVU's academic standards in many areas – registration, timetabling, validation, student support and assessment systems.  The report said "The University chose to implement this vision of a New Learning Environment at the same time as it completely recast the underpinning academic-related administration. As we believe might have been anticipated, this subjected the institution, its staff and its systems, to stresses which it was not able to bear." Despite widespread suspicion that the QAA had sought to exercise its authority by exaggerating what had been an administrative crisis rather than finding any genuine loss of academic credibility, Fitzgerald resigned in 1998 after the QAA report was published&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=109930&amp;sectioncode=26|title=Brought low by high ambitions|date=20 November 1998|website=Timeshighereducation.co.uk|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a management team led by first Sir William Taylor then [[Kenneth Barker (academic)|Ken Barker]] took over, ironically initiating more staff redundancies and closures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/how-one-man-wove-a-kind-of-magic--in-ealing-678294.html|title=US|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fitzgerald worked as an education consultant, but in 2001 he underwent heart surgery, and has not worked since. He is no longer in the public eye, and the only mention of him in recent years has been as an occasional theatre critic at the Edinburgh Festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fringereview.co.uk/pageView.php?pagename=The+FringeReview+Team|title=The FringeReview Team|date=17 July 2015|website=Fringerreview.co.uk|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
Fitzgerald was well connected with Britain's [[New Labour|'New' Labour Party]] led by [[Tony Blair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=110026&amp;sectioncode=26|title=Troubled TVU's teaching could be farmed out|date=27 November 1998|website=Timeshighereducation.co.uk|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Blair and [[David Blunkett]] opened the Paul Hamlyn Learning Resource Centre on the Slough campus in 1996 with the rejoinder: 'Why, I wonder, can't every university be like TVU?'.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Fitzgerald made frequent appearances on British television. He also published regular columns on education policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=94355&amp;sectioncode=26|title=Gloom trimming for job adverts|date=7 July 1995|website=Timeshighereducation.co.uk|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Private Eye]]'' magazine ran a column about a "trendy Vice Chancellor" in the 1990s, based on Fitzgerald.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

'''Moshe Erem''' ({{lang-he|משה ארם}}, born '''Moshe Kazanovski''' on 7 August 1896, died 14 October 1978) was an [[Israel]]i politician who served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for several left-wing parties and factions from 1949 until 1959, and again from 1965 until 1969.

==Biography==
Born in  [[Lyady, Gomel Region|Lyady]] south-eastern [[Belarus]] in the [[Russian Empire]], Erem worked as a high school headteacher in [[Kaunas]]. He made [[aliyah]] to [[Mandatory Palestine]] in 1924, and worked in building and road construction. He joined [[Poale Zion]] movement, later becoming one of its leading figures. In the same year that he immigrated he became a member of the [[Tel Aviv]]-[[Jaffa]] workers council that year, serving on it until 1935. In 1926 he was elected onto Tel Aviv's city council.

In 1935 he was sent to the [[United States]] as a Poale Zion emissary, working there for two years. In 1937 he was invited to Spain (during the [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]]) by the republican government. He also served on the Zionist Executive Committee and the [[Histadrut]]'s executive committee, and worked in the Organisation department of the [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]] in the 1940s.

In the [[Israeli legislative election, 1949|1949 elections]] he was voted into the Knesset on the [[Mapam]] list. He retained his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1951|1951 elections]], but on 23 August 1954, left the party alongside [[Israel Bar-Yehuda]], [[Yitzhak Ben-Aharon]] and [[Aharon Zisling]] to re-establish [[Ahdut HaAvoda|Ahdut HaAvoda - Poale Zion]] as an independent party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knesset.gov.il/faction/eng/FactionHistoryAll_eng.asp Mergers and Splits Among Parliamentary Groups] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected on the new party's list in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1955|1955 elections]], but lost his seat in [[Israeli legislative election, 1959|1959]]. He failed to win a seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1961|1961 elections]], but entered the Knesset on 4 May 1965 as a replacement for the deceased Bar-Yehuda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mkindexByKnesset_eng.asp?knesset=5 Knesset Members in the Fifth Knesset] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; He retained his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1965|November 1965 elections]], by which time Ahdut HaAvoda had entered an alliance with [[Mapai]], known as the [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]]. Following a formal merger of the two (with the addition of [[Rafi (political party)|Rafi]]), in 1968 this became the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]], and, following the addition of Mapam to the alliance, was again renamed the [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]] in 1969. Erem lost his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1969|elections that year]]. He died in 1978.

[[Malay titles#Tun|Tun]] '''Datu Haji Mustapha bin Datu Harun''', or '''Tun Mustapha''' for short (31 July 1918 – 2 January 1995&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww2.sabah.gov.my/istana/Biodata%20Tun%20Datu%20Haji%20Mustafa%20bin%20Datu%20Harun.html Biodata Tun Datu Haji Mustafa bin Datu Harun]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arkib.gov.my/en/web/guest/tun-datu-haji-mustapha-bin-datu-harun Tun Datu Haji Mustafa bin Datu Harun]. arkib.gov.my&lt;/ref&gt;), was the first [[Yang di-Pertua Negeri|governor]] of the [[Malaysia]]n state of [[Sabah]]. He was also the third [[chief minister]] of the state from 1967 to 1975, and was the president for the political party [[United Sabah National Organisation]] (USNO). He is considered by some{{Who|date=December 2016}} to be one of the founding leaders of Sabah and was an important party in the negotiations leading to the [[Malaysia Day|formation of Malaysia]] on 16 September 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Star|url=http://thestar.com.my/columnists/story.asp?file=/2007/9/24/columnists/suhaini/18976180&amp;sec=Suhaini|title=Celebrating Malaysia Day|date=24 September 2007|accessdate=21 January 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011184729/http://thestar.com.my/columnists/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F9%2F24%2Fcolumnists%2Fsuhaini%2F18976180&amp;sec=Suhaini|archivedate=11 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is known to some{{Who|date=December 2016}} as the "father of Sabah's independence" and also the "father of Sabah's development".&lt;ref&gt;"Tun Mustapha dan Pembangunan Sabah (development of Sabah)", ''Yayasan Sabah (2003)''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he is also considered by many Sabahan opposition leaders who later formed the new party [[BERJAYA]] as a dictator and alleged to misappropriated huge sums of money from the state's coffers (primarily through timber concessions) to support his lavish lifestyle.

== Personal life ==
Mustapha was not born in anywhere in the Sulu Archipelago, but he is a distant relative of the [[Sultan of Sulu]]. He was born in Kampung Limau-limauan, [[Kudat]]. He is of [[Tausūg people|Suluk]]-[[Bajau people|Bajau]] origin (Bajau Bannaran/Bajau Kudat and not Bajau Ubian).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reid, Anthony|title= Endangered identity: Kadazan or Dusun in Sabah|publisher=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|volume=28|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War II ===
During World War II, he was wanted by the Japanese forces because of the rebellions he led against them, mainly in Kudat during the [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo#Resistance movement|Japanese occupation]]. But when they could not find him, they caught his younger brother and eventually killed him because his brother would not reveal where he was hiding. [[Albert Kwok]] invited Mustapha to join in the [[Jesselton Revolt]] but he advised Kwok to wait and prepare, saying the time wasn't right for insurrection. However, Kwok was forced to launch the revolt ahead of schedule because the Chinese were going to be subjected to conscription by the Japanese. Kwok was joined in the revolt along with Suluks and Bajaus under Panglima Ali. The revolt failed and the Japanese engaged in large scale massacres of indigenous civilians, including women and children especially from the Suluks community.

== Political career ==
=== Appointment to Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Sabah ===
Mustapha founded the party [[United Sabah National Organisation]], better known by the acronym USNO. He, together with [[Tun Fuad Stephens|Donald Stephens]], are often credited as important figures in Sabah in bringing forth Sabah's independence and in the formation of Malaysia in 1963. When Malaysia was formed on 16 September 1963, he became the first [[Yang di-Pertua Negara]] (governor) of Sabah.

=== Appointment to chief minister of Sabah ===
In the 1967 state election, USNO won, and Mustapha became the third Chief Minister of Sabah.

When he was Chief Minister, his relationship with the Malaysian central government was not very good.  Although the central government, represented by the [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) coalition, was a partner of USNO, they were worried about certain stances taken by Mustapha, in particular, his intention or threat to secede Sabah from Malaysia. Mustapha also refused to sign an oil agreement with the federal government which stated that only 5% of Sabah's oil revenue will be given to the state. Mustapha demanded at least 30% for the development of Sabah where it will be drilled.&lt;ref name="borneo" /&gt;

Mustapha also succeeded in converting a significant number of non-Muslim [[indigenous people]] in Sabah into Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;Åsgård, Björn.[http://nt.diakrit.com/metaweb/304c/uppsats/MFS_Malaysia.pdf "A Study of the Kadazan Dusun, Sabah, Malaysia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928033223/http://nt.diakrit.com/metaweb/304c/uppsats/MFS_Malaysia.pdf |date=28 September 2007 }}, ''Ethnic Awareness and Development'', p. 28. Retrieved 8 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from his involvement in politics and religion (Islam), he also made contributions in the education of Sabah. He mooted the idea of forming Sabah Foundation (''Yayasan Sabah'') and was responsible in setting up the first university, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) Sabah Campus, and also the setting up of ITM (Institut Teknologi Mara).

He was also the Deputy Head of PERKIM, when the late Tunku was the President and also the time of Patinggi Taib. He was also the head of United Sabah Islamic Association (USIA) and a member of RISEAP.

In 1975, USNO secretary-general [[Harris Salleh]] left the party to form [[BERJAYA]].

=== Formation of Sabah chapter of UMNO ===
Since his ouster in 1976, Tun Mustapha had been trying to initiate a merger of his party USNO with peninsular-based [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) in a bid to return to the corridors of power in Sabah. However, the UMNO supreme council was hesitant on a merger because their party did not accept non-Malay/non-muslim members. Besides, the UMNO president at that time, [[Tun Hussein Onn]] was uneasy with Tun Mustapha's close relationship with UMNO's anti-Hussein faction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=P.

Although they never won again, they still managed to win several seats in the state assembly. They also remained a partner of BN at the federal government level (as opposed to the state level).&lt;ref&gt;[http://malaysiana1.blogspot.com/2007/11/about-datuk-seri-harris-salleh-datuk.html malaysiana1: About Datuk Seri Harris Salleh &amp; Datuk Seri Musa Aman&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{unreliable source?|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1990 state election, he teamed up with Harris Salleh again, after BERJAYA themselves were ousted by [[Parti Bersatu Sabah]]. This resulted in a merger of USNO and BERJAYA to create the Sabah chapter of UMNO. Mustapha became its first chief of UMNO Sabah.

== Controversies ==
=== Arrests of Roman Catholic priests and the Islamisation of Sabah State ===
{{main|Demographics of Sabah#Mass conversion and autonomy in freedom of religion issues}}
Mustapha is remembered by the Catholics of Sabah for imposing to the letter the immigration laws by denying foreign priests who have not obtained permanent residency on the extension of their visas. All the priests who object to their expulsion for doing religious works among the Catholics were arrested by using his powers as the Chairman of the State Security Operation Committee and CM of Sabah State Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp68.25092005/02whole.pdf|title=Christian Mission in Malaysia: Past Emphasis, Present Engagement and Future Possibilities|author=Maria Perpetua Kana|work=School of Theology, Faculty of Arts and Sciences|publisher=[[Australian Catholic University]]|date=24 March 2004|accessdate=18 March 2017|page=120 (125/140)|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619100643/http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp68.25092005/02whole.pdf|archivedate=19 June 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under his orders, on 2 December 1972, the police made a raid at the missions at Tambunan, Papar, Bundu Tuhan and Kuala Penyu. The raids at Tambunan and Papar were successful, timed early in the morning with the church bell ropes cut to prevent it from being used to warn the people. The priests were at Kapayan long before the parishioners were aware of it. The raid at Kuala Penyu was initially a fiasco with a reception committee of 600 Catholics. To avoid clashes, by 11&amp;nbsp;am reinforcements were flown in to arrest one priest. On 15 December more priests were arrested at Keningau, Tenom and Limbahau.&lt;ref&gt;the book ''Khabar Gembira'' or "good news" - A history of the catholic church in East Malaysia and Brunei 1880 to 1976 by Fr John Rooney MHM Phd -  1981 Burns and Oates Ltd Wellwood North Farm rd, Turnbridge Wells Kent&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the priests who only had temporary residence permits, on hearing this has no choice but to say goodbye to their parishioners and went home or were given new assignments to nearby countries. As reported in local news such as ''Daily Express'' (p.&amp;nbsp;2, 11 November 2009), the Malaysian home ministry informed in parliament that a biography of Mustapha's political opponent who died in the [[Double Six Crash]] plane crash, Peter Mojuntin, is banned. The reason was that the book "allegedly" recorded that Peter exposed Mustapha's attempt to stop Catholism in Sabah by deporting and arresting foreign missionary priests who were serving their local parishes in the state.&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Express News'' page 2, 11 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter's house was also surrounded by the police after all the priests were arrested because only he dared to voice his opposition to the prosecution of the priests. He was not arrested because of his strong political support from the Kadazan people of Penampang.&lt;ref name=goldensonofkadazan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernard|first1=Sta Maria|title=Peter J Mojuntin - The Golden Son of Kadazan|date=May 1978|publisher=Chan Litho Press Sdn Bhd|location=Ujong Pasir, Melaka|pages=7–23|url=http://koeln.ccc.de/media/pdf/TheGoldenSonOfTheKadazan(compact).pdf|accessdate=21 May 2015}} Released online on [http://koeln.ccc.de/media/pdf/ 7 March 2013] courtesy of [[Chaos Computer Club]] Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[20-point agreement]] had provided that “there should be no any state religion in North Borneo”, Mustapha party of USNO including himself is very active in propagating [[Islam]] and amend a bill to make Islam as the official religion of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.usm.my/km/33(2)2015/km33022015_01.pdf|title=Patronage, Power and Prowess: Barisan Nasional's Equilibrium Dominance in East Malaysia|author=Faisal H.

He actively campaigned to persuade non-Muslims to convert to Islam due to what he perceive that the unity can only be achieved through a common religion and language, where he also make the Malay language as the official language of Sabah by limiting the importance of English language. By February 1974, around 75,000 non-Muslim Sabahans had been converted to Islam which rapidly increase to 95,000 in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalarticle.ukm.my/420/1/1.pdf|title=The Politics of centre-state conflict: the Sabah experience under the ruling Sabah Alliance (1963–1976)|author=Mohammad Agus Yusoff|publisher=Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|year=1999|accessdate=4 November 2017|page=14/25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104113624/http://journalarticle.ukm.my/420/1/1.pdf|archivedate=4 November 2017|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aiding the Moro rebels in the southern Philippines ===
{{main article|Refugees of the Philippines|Illegal immigrants in Malaysia|Moro conflict in the Philippines}}
During Mustapha term as a Chief Minister of Sabah, he has a vision to make Islam as the majority religion in the state.

The Philippine central government then retracted the [[North Borneo dispute|Sabah claim]] in 1977 as a reward for Malaysian government action to stop supporting the southern Philippines Muslim rebels.&lt;ref name="Nair2013"/&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
[[File:Putatan Sabah TamanMemorialTunDatuMustapha-04.jpg|thumb|right|Mustapha tomb in [[Putatan]]]]
He died on 2 January 1995 at Sabah Medical Centre, Teluk Likas, Kota Kinabalu, at the age of 76.

==Background and education==
He was born in Kampala, Uganda's capital city, on 15 November 1947.

==Career==
Following the expulsion of Asians by Idi Amin in 1972, Nasser Sebaggala acquired an electronics and clothes store on Kampala Road, the main thoroughfare in Kampala. His business interests grew over time. In 1998, he began his political career by running for the position of Mayor of Kampala. Ostensibly a member of the [[Democratic Party (Uganda)|Democratic Party]], Sebaggala won the first direct elections for mayor of Kampala in 1998, beating two government-sponsored candidates. However, he was arrested in the [[United States]] two months later, in June 1998, on eight counts of [[fraud]] and lying to U.S. customs officials.  In February 1999, he received a 15-month sentence, but was paroled in December 1999.  He returned to Kampala in February 2000 to a warm welcome&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kampala Welcomes Fraudster Ex-Mayor|  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/629884.stm|date=3 February 2000|first=News|last=BBC|accessdate=31 December 2014|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and considered a bid in the 2001 presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=31 December 2014|last=Fisher| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/18/world/kampala-journal-when-a-questionable-past-pays-political-dividends.html|first=Ian| title=Kampala Journal; When A Questionable Past Pays Political Dividends|date=18 July 2000|newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/635373.stm|

In mid-December 2005, he broke with the Democratic Party (DP), after he came third in the party presidential primaries, which was won by [[Ssebaana Kizito]], and registered himself as an independent.  A week later, he reversed himself, withdrawing his candidacy and announcing his support for Kizito. When he lost the Democratic Party nominations to [[Norbert Mao]] in 2010, he quit the DP and formed his own party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.observer.ug/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7411:why-sebaggala-had-to-quit-dp |title=Why Sebaggala Had To Quit DP|date=24 February 2010|

==Early life==
Hilton was born in [[London]], the son of Elizabeth Amelia (Freedman) and Mortimer Jacob Hilton, and was educated at [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]].&lt;ref name="bp-about"&gt;"About the speaker", [http://www.nationalcodescentre.org/edu/lectures/turing.rhtm announcement] of a lecture given by Peter Hilton at Bletchley Park on 12 July 2006, accessed 18 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/dec/02/peter-hilton-obituary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/102834&lt;/ref&gt; He won a scholarship to [[the Queen's College, Oxford]] in 1940.&lt;ref name="bp-about"/&gt;

==Career==
During the [[Second World War]], as an [[undergraduate]], Hilton was obliged to enroll in training with the [[Royal Artillery]], and was scheduled for [[conscription]] in summer 1942.&lt;ref name="lwf-190"&gt;Peter Hilton, "Living with Fish: Breaking Tunny in the Newmanry and the Testery", p. 190 from pp. 189-203 in [[Jack Copeland]] ed, ''Colossus: The Secrets of [[Bletchley Park]]'s Codebreaking Computers'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he was interviewed by a team touring universities looking for mathematicians with knowledge of [[German language|German]], and was offered a position in the [[Foreign Office]] without being told the nature of the work. The team was, in fact, recruiting on behalf of the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School|Government Code and Cypher School]]. He accepted, and, aged 18, arrived at wartime [[codebreaking]] station [[Bletchley Park]] on 12 January 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, "Living with Fish", p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

He was initially put to work on Naval [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] in [[Hut 8]]. In late 1942, he transferred to work on German [[teleprinter]] ciphers.&lt;ref name="lwf-190"/&gt; A special section known as the "[[Testery]]" had been formed in July 1942 to work on one such cipher, codenamed "[[Lorenz cipher|Tunny]]", and Hilton was one of the early members of the group.&lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;Jerry Roberts, "Major Tester's Section", p. 250 of pp. 249-259 in Jack Copeland ed, ''Colossus: The Secrets of Bletchley Park's Codebreaking Computers'', Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; His role was to devise ways to deal with changes in Tunny, and to liaise with another section working on Tunny, the "[[Newmanry]]", which complemented the hand-methods of the Testery with specialised codebreaking machinery.&lt;ref name="roberts"/&gt; Occasionally the same message was sent repeated, a major security blunder which Bletchley park called a "depth." Hilton derived great satisfaction from being able to look at the encoded texts coming from two separate teleprinter messages, combine them and extract two messages in clear German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/science-obituaries/8124447/Professor-Peter-Hilton.html|title=Professor Peter Hilton|date=14 November 2010

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Station X|publisher=Channel 4|date=1999|format=Television Documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hilton obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] in 1949 from [[Oxford University]] under the supervision of [[John Henry Whitehead]]. His dissertation was titled, "Calculation of the Homotopy Groups of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-polyhedra".&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;David Joyner and David Kahn, editors, "Edited Transcript of Interview with Peter Hilton for ''Secrets of War''", in ''[[Cryptologia]]'' 30(3), July–September 2006, pp. 236–250.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, he became the Mason Professor of Pure Mathematics at the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref name="bp-about"/&gt; He moved to the United States in 1962 to be Professor of Mathematics at [[Cornell University]], a post he held until 1971.&lt;ref name="all-sorts"/&gt; From 1971 to 1973, he held a joint appointment as Fellow of the Battelle Seattle Research Center and Professor of Mathematics at the University of Washington. 1 September 1972, he was appointed Louis D. Beaumont University Professor at [[Case Western Reserve University]]. 1 September 1973, he took up the appointment. In 1982, he was appointed Distinguished Professor of Mathematics at [[Binghamton University]], becoming Emeritus in 2003. Latterly he spent each spring semester as Distinguished Professor of Mathematics at the [[University of Central Florida]].

Hilton constructed the 51-letter [[palindrome]] "Doc note, I dissent. A fast never prevents a fatness. I diet on cod."&lt;ref&gt;Jack Good, "Enigma and Fish", p. 160 from pp. 149-166 in F. H. Hinsley and Alan Strip, editors, ''Codebreakers: The Inside Story of Bletchley Park'', 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilton's principal research interests were in algebraic topology, homological algebra, categorical algebra and mathematics education. He published 15 books and over 600 articles in these areas, some jointly with colleagues.

Hilton is featured in Mathematical People.&lt;ref&gt;D. Albers and [[Gerald L. Alexanderson|G.L. Alexanderson]], Mathematical People, Birkhauser, Boston, 1995. {{isbn|0-8176-3191-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hilton's theorem===
Named after Hilton is [[Hilton's theorem]] (1955) on the [[homotopy group]]s of a [[Join (mathematics)|join]] of [[sphere]]s.

==Death==
Peter Hilton died in [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States, at age 87.

==In popular culture==
Hilton is portrayed by actor [[Matthew Beard (British actor)|Matthew Beard]] in the 2014 film ''[[The Imitation Game]]'', which tells the tale of [[Alan Turing]] and the cracking of [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Enigma code]].

'''Raymond Percy Galton''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100|OBE}} (17 July 1930 – 5 October 2018) was an English radio and television scriptwriter, best known for the [[Galton and Simpson]] comedy writing partnership with [[Alan Simpson (scriptwriter)|Alan Simpson]]. Together they devised and wrote many 1950s and 60s  popular [[BBC]] [[British sitcom|sitcom]]s  including  ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]'' (1954–1961), the first two seasons of ''[[Comedy Playhouse]]'' (1961–1963), and ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'' (1962–1974).

==Early life==
Galton was born in [[Paddington]], [[West London (sub region)|West London]], and after leaving school he worked for the [[Transport and General Workers Union]]. He contracted [[tuberculosis]] aged 18 in 1948 and was admitted to Milford Sanatorium near [[Godalming]] in [[Surrey]], where he met fellow patient Alan Simpson.&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/how-we-met-ray-galton-alan-simpson-1219717.html|title=How We Met: Ray Galton &amp; Alan Simpson|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=independent2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/galton-and-simpson-grumpy-old-men-1360341.html|title=GALTON AND SIMPSON: GRUMPY OLD MEN?|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/05/05/ray-galton-and-alan-simpson-interview-there-never-was-a-golden-a/|title=Ray Galton and Alan Simpson interview: There never was a Golden Age of TV|date=5 May 2016|accessdate=6 October 2018|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Galton and Simpson==
{{main|Galton and Simpson}}

==Later career==
Alan Simpson retired from scriptwriting in 1978 to concentrate on business interests. Galton then often worked with [[Johnny Speight]] on scripts,  including ''[[Spooner's Patch]]'' (1979–1982) about a corrupt police station. He also wrote scripts for sitcoms produced in Germany and Scandinavia. His last sitcom was ''[[Get Well Soon (TV series)|Get Well Soon]]'' in 1997 which he co-created with [[John Antrobus]] and which was based on his own experiences in a sanatorium. In October 2005, Galton and Antrobus premiered their play ''[[Steptoe and Son in Murder at Oil Drum Lane]]'' at the Theatre Royal, York. The play was set in the present day and related the events that led to Harold killing his father, and their eventual meeting thirty years later (Albert appearing as a ghost).

==Honours and awards==
Galton won two BAFTA awards among many others such as a British Comedy Award. 
He accepted an OBE in 2000 and he and Simpson received  a [[BAFTA Fellowship]] on 8 May 2016.&lt;ref name=bafta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/television/awards/ray-galton-alan-simpson-bafta-fellowship-in-2016|title=Ray Galton &amp; Alan Simpson - BAFTA Fellowship in 2016|website=Bafta.org|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==
Galton married Tonia Phillips in 1956, and they had three children; she died in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/07/ray-galton-obituary Ray Galton Obituary] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 7 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;. He died on 5 October 2018. Galton's family said he passed away in his sleep at a family home after a long battle with [[dementia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/groundbreaking-sitcom-writer-ray-galton-dies-11519144|title=Groundbreaking sitcom writer Ray Galton dies|website=News.sky.com|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holcomb is best known for his groundbreaking work in HIV Prevention when he founded 'Project Weber',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanchoronline.org/news/2011/10/31/male-prostitution-in-providence/|title=Male prostitution in Providence|author=Technology|work=The Anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt; a program for male sex-workers in Rhode Island,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Siegel|first=Joe|title=Former Male Prostitute Helps Hustlers Leave R.I.

Holcomb has done extensive research on male prostitution in the United States, Canada and Europe, and has been featured in several films on this subject.
__TOC__

== Brief History ==
Holcomb is a recovering addict who began his career in [[HIV prevention]] in November 2007. The Project Weber outreach team he leads provides condom distribution, needle exchange, substance abuse referrals and HIV testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aidscareos.org/ProgramsServices/PreventionCenter/StreetOutreach.aspx |title=Street Outreach - Programs &amp; Services|work=aidscareos.org|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cited the lack of data available on male commercial sex workers in the region as his reason for helping develop a 2010 survey to assess the needs of this population. Project Weber recruited and surveyed 50 male sex workers living on the streets of [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]. Holcomb also cited that the fact that he and members of his team are former sex workers themselves as one of the primary reasons why they were able to gain access to the men in order to conduct this survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goslant|first=Justin|title=Male Prostitution in Providence|url=http://www.theanchoronline.org/news/2011/10/31/male-prostitution-in-providence|work=The Anchor Newspaper|accessdate=31 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702224116/http://www.theanchoronline.org/news/2011/10/31/male-prostitution-in-providence/|archivedate=2 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project says they have gleaned valuable data on male sex workers who work and live on the streets of Providence. Holcomb and his team were the first to gather data on this population in Rhode Island history. [[Prostitution in Rhode Island]] was legal until 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120359052 |title=Prostitution Now Outlawed In R.I., But Is That Good?|work=NPR|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His work has generated interest from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and has received national attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Siegel|first=Joe|title=Do HIV/AIDS Service Organizations Effectively Reach Male Sex Workers?|url=http://www.edgenewengland.com/index.php?id=126242 |work=Edge New|accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy and education ==
Holcomb has provided the general public with educational trainings regarding male sex workers in the U.S. and abroad. He presented Project Weber for the first time on a national level at the [[National Minority AIDS Council|2010 HIV Prevention Leadership Summit]] in Washington, D.C..

One of his most notable presentations was on January 29, 2011 in Providence, Rhode Island. Holcomb brought experts from different countries together to raise awareness and advocate for services and support. Following the testimonies of the sex workers in recovery, the highlight of the event was a presentation by actor Mirek Caslavka from the Czech Republic. Caslavka introduced the award-winning film he starred in titled [[Mandragora (film)|Mandragora]], a drama about male prostitution in Prague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Lost Voices of the Streets|url=http://arttixri.com/event/detail/441088646/Mandragora|work=Article in Artix.com .|accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holcomb received a "hero's recognition" in the September 2012 issue of [[POZ (magazine)|POZ magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Midnight Cowboy|url=http://www.poz.com/articles/Holcomb_Weber_HIV_2731_22824.shtml|work=POZ Heros.|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is featured in the documentary film ''Invisible: The Unseen World of Male Prostitution''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graumanfilms.com/films/|title=Grauman Films - Invisible|work=Grauman Films}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drop-in Center ==
On October 1, 2013, Holcomb became Project Director of the first peer support drop-in center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/optionsri/docs/optionsoct2013_final/11?e=4008234%2F5113544|title=ISSUU - Options Newsmagazine-October 2013 by Options Magazine|author=Options Magazine|work=Issuu}}&lt;/ref&gt; for male sex workers in the United States. The center's staff meet their clients in a safe and non-judgmental environment, using a [[harm reduction]] approach. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Drop-In Center Opens for Male Sex Workers|url= http://optionsri.org/drop-in-center-opens-for-male-sex-workers-in-providence/.|accessdate= 1 April 2018| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221005/https://www.optionsri.org/drop-in-center-opens-for-male-sex-workers-in-providence| archive-date= 3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sara María Aldrete Villareal''' (born September 6, 1964) is a convicted [[Mexicans|Mexican]] [[serial killer]] who headed a drug-smuggling and human sacrifice cult with [[Adolfo Constanzo]]. The members of the cult, dubbed by the media as The Narcosatanists (Spanish: "Los Narcosatánicos"), called her '''The Godmother''' ("La Madrina"), with Constanzo as “The Godfather”  ("El Padrino").  The cult was involved in multiple ritualistic killings in [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]], Mexico, including the [[murder of Mark Kilroy]], an American student killed in Matamoros in 1989.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]], Mexico, she attended high school in [[Brownsville, Texas]], [[United States]] while still living south of [[US-Mexico border|the border]], and gained [[Alien (law)|resident alien]] status so she could attend [[Texas Southmost College]]. She was known among her peers as a good student. She is {{convert|6|ft|1|in|m|abbr=on}} tall and studied [[physical education]], preparing to transfer to a university to earn a teaching certification in physical education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/constanzo/4.html|author=Michael Newton|title=Crime Library: "La Madrina"|accessdate=July 7, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813181647/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/constanzo/4.html|archivedate=August 13, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Adolfo Constanzo]], a [[Cuban-American|Cuban American]] [[fortune-telling|fortune-teller]] and religious [[cult]] leader, introduced her to witchcraft and dark magic. He gave her the nickname "La Madrina", Spanish for "godmother", and initiated her into his cult, which was a conglomeration of [[Santería]], [[Aztec religion|Aztec warrior ritual]], and [[Palo (religion)|Palo Mayombe]], complete with blood sacrifices. Constanzo sexually assaulted and killed drug dealers and used their body parts for religious sacrifice ceremonies in an old warehouse near Matamoros. Many of his victims' body parts were cooked in a large pot called a ''[[nganga]]''. Constanzo made Sara Aldrete second-in-command of his cult, and directed her to supervise his followers while he was shipping [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] over the border into the U.S.

===Killings===
In 1989, the killings grew more frequent and gained attention when American tourist [[Mark J. Kilroy]], a University of Texas student on Spring Break, was abducted. Constanzo, Aldrete and the rest of the cult went on the run when detectives discovered their 'shrine'. They found human hair, brains, teeth and skulls at the site of the murders. Eventually, the police found their hideout in [[Mexico City]] on May 6, 1989. After a shootout, Constanzo and one of his accomplices were shot and killed by another member of the cult, apparently at Constanzo's behest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leader in Cult Slayings Ordered Own Death, Two Companions Say|work= [[New York Times]]|quote=The leader of a drug-smuggling cult that is believed to have killed 15 people and buried their bodies along the United States-Mexican border ordered his own killing when the police closed in on him, two of his companions said today.|date=May 8, 1989|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEEDA103AF93BA35756C0A96F948260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aldrete was convicted of criminal association in 1990 and jailed for six years. In a second trial, she was convicted of several of the killings at the cult's headquarters, and sentenced to 30 years in prison. If Aldrete is ever released from prison, American authorities plan to prosecute her for the murder of Mark Kilroy.

[[File:SignaresBal.jpg|thumb|300px|A Signares ball, with European men.]]
'''Signare''' was the name for the [[Mulatto]] French-African women of the island of [[Gorée]] in [[French Senegal]] during the 18th and 19th centuries. These women of color managed to gain some individual assets, status, and power in the hierarchies of the [[Atlantic slave trade|Atlantic Slave Trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Signares of St. Louis and Gorée: Women Entrepreneurs in Eighteenth-Century Senegal|last = Brooks|first = George|publisher = |year = 1976|isbn = |location = |pages = 19–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and economic role==
Signares commonly had power in networks of trade and wealth within the limitations of slavery. The influence held by these women led to changes in gender roles in the family structure archetype. Some owned masses of land as well as slaves. European merchants and traders, especially the French and British, would settle on coastal societies inhabited by signares in order to benefit from the increased proximity to the sources of African commerce. The earliest of these merchants were the Portuguese. These merchants were given the name "''[[lançados]]''", because "they threw themselves" among Africans, and they would establish relationships with the most influential signares who would accept them in order to obtain commercial privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Hafkin, Nancy J., and Edna G. Bay. ''Women in Africa: Studies in Social and Economic Change''. Stanford, CA: Stanford UP, 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many signares were wed under “common local law” that was recognized by priests of the Catholic faith. These marriages were for economic and social reasons. Both signares and their husbands gained from these partnerships. Europeans passed their names down to the offspring and with it their lineage.

[[File:La Signare de Gorée avec ses esclaves-Musée de la Compagnie des Indes.jpg|thumb|A signare on [[Gorée]] along with her slaves.]]
When some of the signares became too powerful, leaders like the Portuguese Crown sought ways to remove the women from their wealth.  Different crimes that the Portuguese Crown sought to accuse the women of were crimes against the state or crimes against Christianity. An example of this appears with [[Bibiana Vaz|Bibiana Vuz de França]]. She was a prominent signare who over the years accumulated a lot of wealth and slaves. After realizing how powerful that she was, the Crown wanted to find a way dismantle her influence and power.  “Accused of rebellion, trading with foreigners, and tax evasion, she was imprisoned with her younger brother and another co-conspirator and taken to Cape Verde Islands”.&lt;ref&gt;Havik, Philip J.. Women and trade in the Guinea Bissau region: the role of African and Luso-African women in trade networks from the early 16th to the mid 19th century.2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 

She was able to receive a royal pardon and free her younger brother after leading a coup against the Crown’s representatives.  Due to her power, the Crown sought to criminalize Bibiana Vuz de França. However, once they realized that she was too powerful and too influential, all charges against her were dropped and she was once more considered loyal to the crown. Bibiana Vuz de França’s confrontation with the Portuguese Crown represents the strength that the signares in this time period had, and also the Portuguese growing inability to control the people.

=== Social mobility ===

The social status of signares also allowed for greater social mobility in Gorée than in other parts of Africa. Though there is limited documentation on the origins of most of the signares, it seems likely that at this time the people of Gorée were divided into several social classes: the ''jambor ''or freeborn; the ''jam'' or people of slave descent; the ''tega ''and ''uga ''or blacksmiths and leatherworkers and ''griots ''or storytellers. 

Many signares were of the ''jam ''or ''griot'' class, and were often married by European men because they were considered especially beautiful. Once married to European men, women helped them handle many of their trading affairs and transactions, and gained economic and social stature in the community themselves. In this way women of lower social status could gain power in the community and become important traders through their marital status.

=== Marital practices ===
Marriages between African women and European men were governed by local law. Given the fact that many European men would not stay in Gorée permanently, marriages were often in a state of flux. If a European man left Gorée and intended to return, the African woman would wait for him. When the man got on the boat to go back to Europe, signares would scoop up the sand where his last footprints were and put it a handkerchief, which she'd hang on her bedpost it until he returned. Signares would often wait years for men to return without remarrying. 

If European men left without planning to return, or if a signare learned that her European husband was not going to return to Gorée, women would remarry. This was not considered shameful in any way, and signares would not lose any of their social status, and would often retain much of the trading power that they gained through their prior marital status. Remarried signares would often raise their children from their European husbands alongside their new African husbands, and these children would receive inheritance from their mothers, not their fathers.

'''Techno Viking''' is an [[internet phenomenon]] or [[Internet meme|meme]] based on a video from the 2000 [[Fuckparade]] in [[Berlin]], Germany.
==Summary==
The 4-minute video shot by experimental video artist Matthias Fritsch at the Fuckparade on 8 July 2000&lt;ref name=Archive&gt;Matthias Fritsch, [http://www.technoviking.tv/subrealic.net/works/installation/technoviking-archiv/technoviking-archive.html The Technoviking Archive], Staatliche Hochschule für Gestaltung Karlsruhe.&lt;/ref&gt; begins with the title "Kneecam No. 1". The camera is on a group of dancing people with a blue-haired woman in front. A man stumbles into the scene grabbing the woman. A bare-chested man (known colloquially as the Techno Viking) wearing a [[Mjölnir]] pendant enters the scene while turning to that man.  He grabs him by the arms and the camera follows, showing the confrontation. The bare-chested man pushes the guy back in the direction he came. He looks at him sternly and then points his finger at him, ensuring he behaves.&lt;ref name="note1" group="notes"&gt;in the full video the offender is seen later, sitting on the back of a truck as the camera is turned to the side for a few seconds&lt;/ref&gt; Then the camera follows the bare-chested man as the techno parade continues. Another observer comes from the back of the scene offering an inverted bottle of water to him. As the situation calms down, the bare-chested man starts to dance down Rosenthaler Straße ({{Coord|52|31|33.8|N|13|24|13.2|E|region:DE-BE_type:event|display=inline|name=filming location}}) to [[techno]] music.&lt;ref&gt;The two tracks appear to be "Navigator" by Can-D-Music, and "Save Changes And Exit" by Winstan vs. Noia; Fritsch, The Technoviking Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Reception and release==

==Career==

Eyster began his career at the age of 9, on an episode of the soap opera ''[[Santa Barbara (TV series)|Santa Barbara]]'' in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hischak|first=Thomas S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e1RTP8thtR0C&amp;pg=PA70|title=Disney Voice Actors: A Biographical Dictionary|year=2011|pages=70–71|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|via=[[Google Books]]|isbn=978-0-7864-6271-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eyster|first=Trevor|url=http://www.campanawanna.com/Campers/Eyster/Site2/Acting.html|title=Acting|website=Trevor Eyster's website|accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thereafter appeared in a number of television episodes, two TV films, and two feature films through 1992. As a voice actor he also performed in [[Disney]]'s 25-minute animated featurette ''[[The Prince and the Pauper (1990 film)|The Prince and the Pauper]]'' (1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCall|first=Douglas L.|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=ALmJCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ja#v=onepage&amp;q=Tim%20Eyster&amp;f=false|title=Film Cartoons: A Guide to 20th Century American Animated Features and Shorts|year=1998|page=185|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|via=[[Google Books]]|isbn=978-0-7864-2450-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, he played [[Ray Krebbs]]' son Jock in the ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' series finale "[[Conundrum (Dallas)|Conundrum]]".

His best-known role as a child actor was starring in the role of Eugene "Sponge" Harris on the two-season [[Nickelodeon]] television series ''[[Salute Your Shorts]]'' (1991–1992). In 1992 he was nominated for a [[Young Artist Award]] for "Best Young Actor Co-Starring in a Cable Series" for the role.&lt;ref name=YAA/&gt; Since 2010 Eyster has appeared in various reunion gatherings of the show's stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waldenponders.com/salute-your-shorts-reunion.html|title="Salute Your Shorts" Reunion|website=waldenponders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kelly|last=Connolly |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/06/01/salute-your-shorts-cast-reunites |title=Salute Your Shorts cast reunites—and Donkeylips sings the theme song |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=June 1, 2015 |accessdate=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=My Night of Nickelodeon Nostaglia|url=http://on.elle.com/17CAMMr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dvVoqPudAg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m18s|title="90's Nickelodeon Celebration!" Reunion|website=waldenponders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ''Salute Your Shorts'' series was discontinued in 1992, except for a role in an episode of ''[[Babylon 5]]'' in 1998, Eyster took a 21-year break from screen acting, resuming in 2013 as an adult actor after changing his first name from Tim to Trevor. As an adult he has appeared in a number of short films, done small roles in television series and TV films, and starred in his own self-produced docudrama series.

==Activism==
In 2011, Eyster founded the non-profit organization "...and then, Angels descended", an empathy-driven, micro-volunteering organization which seeks to bridge the empathy deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=...and then, Angel's descended|url=http://www.angelsdescended.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; His organization was granted 501(c)(3) status by the IRS in 2012. The organization pairs volunteer "angels" with those who reach out for help through the organization's website.

In 2016, he created the docudrama miniseries ''[[SpongeyLeaks]]'' after he discovered his disabled aunt was being abused by her state-paid [[Home care|In-Home Supportive Services]] (IHSS) caregiver. The series documents the events that happened after Eyster discovered the abuse and neglect that was occurring, and also examines the issue of [[elder abuse]] and [[patient abuse|dependent adult abuse]]. The ''SpongeyLeaks'' [[webisode]] series premiered December 19, 2016. In January 2017, Eyster appeared on ''The Dee Armstrong Show'' to discuss elder abuse and disabled-adult abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Interview with Trevor Eyster on The Dee Armstrong Show |url=https://www.facebook.com/TheDeeArmstrongShow/videos/1533539809995322/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Morton Wheeler''' (March 19, 1865 – April 19, 1937) was an American [[entomologist]], [[myrmecologist]] and [[Harvard]] professor.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
William Morton Wheeler was born on March 19, 1865 to parents Julius Morton Wheeler and Caroline Georgiana Wheeler ({{nee}} Anderson) in [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin.{{sfn|Parker|1938|p=203}} At a young age, Wheeler had an interest in natural history, first being when he observed a moth ensnared in a spiders web; such observation interested Wheeler that he became importunate for more nature lore.{{sfn|Melander|Carpenter|1937|p=433}} Wheeler attended public school, but, due to "persistently bad behavior", he was transferred to a local [[University School of Milwaukee|German academy]] which was known for its extreme discipline.{{efn|Stated by Wheeler himself.{{sfn|Melander|Carpenter|1937|p=433}}}} After he completed his courses in the German academy, he attended a German normal school. In both institutions, Wheeler was trained in a variety of subjects: he was given training in languages, philosophy and science. By this time, he could read fluently in French, German, Greek, Italian, Latin and Spanish.{{sfn|Parker|1938|p=203}}{{sfn|Melander|Carpenter|1937|p=433}} While he was a student at the German academy, Wheeler would frequently observe the old museum of natural history at the institution.{{sfn|Melander|Carpenter|1937|p=434}}

In 1884, [[Henry August Ward]], proprietor of the [[Ward's Natural Science Establishment]], brought a collection of stuffed and skeletonized mammals, birds and reptiles, and also a series of marine invertebrates to the academy. This was to persuade the city fathers to purchase them and combine them with the present collection at the academy, in which it would lay the foundation for a free municipal museum
of natural history.{{sfn|Parker|1938|p=204}} Wheeler, who had familiarized himself with the museum since childhood, volunteered to spend the nights in helping to unpack and install the specimens.{{sfn|Melander|Carpenter|1937|p=434}}{{sfn|Parker|1938|p=204}} Impressed by his enthusiasm, Ward offered Wheeler a job in his [[Rochester, New York]] establishment. His first duties were to identify and list birds and mammals and the preparation of catalogues.{{sfn|Melander|Carpenter|1937|p=434}}{{sfn|Parker|1938|p=204}} He was later made as a foreman and spent most of his time identifying and arranging the collection of shells, echinoderms, and sponges, as well as preparing catalogues and price lists of these specimens for publication.{{sfn|Parker|1938|p=204}}

In 1885, Wheeler returned to Milwaukee to teach German and physiology at a high school.{{sfn|Melander|Carpenter|1937|p=434}}{{sfn|Parker|1938|p=207}} At the time, George W. Peckham was the principal of the school, in which Wheeler and Peckham formed a close working relationship.{{sfn|Melander|Carpenter|1937|p=434}} Wheeler collaborated with some of Peckham's published papers by illustrating the [[Pedipalp|palpi]] and [[epigyne]]s of spiders, and by assisting him and his wife with their field work on wasps.{{sfn|Parker|1938|p=207}} Wheeler was also under the influence of professors [[Charles Otis Whitman|C.O. Whitman]] and Dr. William Pattern, who were embryologists at the Allis Lake Laboratory in Milwaukee. He was inspired by Pattern to study insect embryology and did so for several years. During this time, Wheeler left the high school in 1887 and become a custodian at [[Milwaukee Public Museum]], a position he held until 1890. He studied embryology at home and after work hours, in which he had set up a small laboratory.{{sfn|Melander|Carpenter|1937|p=434}} He left Milwaukee after leaving the museum to assist Whitman at [[Clark University]], and, by 1892, secured a [[doctorate]] in philosophy; his dissertation was "Contribution to Insect Embryology".{{sfn|Melander|Carpenter|1937|p=434}}{{sfn|Parker|1938|p=210}} At the same time, Wheeler commenced his work on insects and published around 10 entomological papers, which presented himself as a candidate for the degree of Ph.D.{{sfn|Parker|1938|p=211}} After receiving a call from the [[University of Chicago]], Whitman subsequently accepted their offer, followed by Wheeler who was appointed under him as instructor in embryology in 1892. He held this position until 1897, where he became the assistant professor in his chosen field.{{sfn|Parker|1938|p=211}} Before he began his duties at Chicago, Wheeler was given a year's absence, allowing him to study in Europe between 1893 and 1894. There, he first spent time at the Zoological Institute at the University of Wiirzburg as a student, and also at the Naples Zoological Station. Enamoured by the fauna of Naples, Wheeler studied the sex life of ''[[Myzostoma]]'', a subject he further studied at the Institut Zoologique at Liege, Belgium. His monograph on ''Myzostoma'' was published in 1897 by professor E. Van Beneden in the ''Archives de Biologie''.{{sfn|Parker|1938|p=212}}

===Career===
Wheeler returned to Chicago in 1894 and was a teacher of embryology for five years. He continued to publish more papers, half of which involved insects. Wheeler married his wife Dora Bay Emerson in 1898, where they both met each other in Chicago previously.{{sfn|Parker|1938|p=212}} In 1899, he was offered the "Professorship In Zoology" following the death of professor Norman of the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]]. There, he took the opportunity to reorganize the department as professor of zoology. He remained there until 1903, but during this period was when Wheeler developed an interest in the behavior and classification of ants. The ants would eventually become the predominant group of insects he studied.{{sfn|Parker|1938|p=212–213}}{{sfn|Melander|Carpenter|1937|p=435}} His two children were also born in [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]], Illinois while he was staying in Texas.{{sfn|Parker|1938|p=213}}

A number of students sought to study under Wheeler; notable entomologists such as [[C. T. Brues]] and [[A. L. Melander]] made their way to Austin and spent several years studying there in his labaratory. This began an influx of young students, both who were pupils and scientific associates, to study and research for long periods of time under his guidance.{{sfn|Parker|1938|p=213}} Other students include [[C. L. Metcalf]], [[T. D. Mitchell]], [[O. E. Plath]], [[George Salt]], [[Alfred C. Kinsey]], [[George C. Wheeler]], [[Frank M. Carpenter]], [[William S. Creighton]], [[Neal A. Weber]], [[J. G. Myers]], [[William M. Mann]], [[Marston Bates]] and [[Philip J. Darlington]].{{sfn|Sleigh|2007|p=71}}

In 1903, Wheeler resigned from his position at the University of Texas and accepted the position "Curator of Invertebrate Zoology" at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City.{{sfn|Melander|Carpenter|1937|p=435}}{{sfn|Sleigh|2007|p=71}}

A close contact of the British [[myrmecologist]] and [[coleopterist]] [[Horace Donisthorpe]], it was to Wheeler whom Donisthorpe dedicated his [https://archive.org/stream/britishantstheir00donirich#page/n3/mode/2up first major book on ants] in 1915. Donisthorpe and Wheeler also frequently exchanged specimens, leading the latter to first develop the idea that the [[Formicinae]] [[subfamily]] had its origins in North America.

For his work, ''Ants of the American Museum Congo Expedition'', Wheeler was awarded the [[Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal]] from the National Academy of Sciences in 1922.{{sfn|National Academy of Sciences}} He was professor of [[applied biology]] at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Bussey Institute]], which had one of the most highly regarded biology programs in the United States.

In 1924 he spent about two months in Panama with [[Nathan_Banks| Dr. Nathan Banks]], collecting invertebrates around Barro Colorado and along the railroad in the vicinity of Panama City.
Wheeler led the [[Harvard Australian Expedition (1931–1932)]] on behalf of the [[Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology]], a six-man venture sent for the dual purpose of procuring specimens - the museum being "weak in Australian animals and...desires[ing] to complete its series" - and to engage in "the study of the animals of the region when alive."&lt;ref&gt;Nature International Journal of Science No. 3228, VOL. 128 - https://www.nature.com/articles/128457c0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Guide to Stag Beetles of Australia By George Hangay, Roger de Keyzer (p. 139) - https://books.google.com/books?id=CqxWDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=Harvard+expedition+to+Australia+in+1931&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z7sMfkRcr3&amp;sig=F82aRX9ZWuNqujfCXBHj90YFs5A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt3Kq1_K3bAhWB7lMKHW0uAJ8Q6AEIWTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Harvard%20expedition%20to%20Australia%20in%201931&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The mission was  success with over 300 mammal and thousands of insect specimens returning to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Capinera, John L.|chapter=Darlington, Jr., Philip J|title=Encyclopedia of Entomologists|year=2008|pages=1153–1154|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&amp;pg=PA1153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;About the Exhibits by Elizabeth Hall and Max Hall (Museum of Comparative Zoology "Agazziz Museum" Havard University.

At a press conference on 28 May 2011, Mr. Dookeran indicated that he will not be seeking re-election to the post. In the 24 May 2010 election, he successfully ran for [[Member of Parliament]] for the [[Tunapuna]] [[constituency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coptnt.com|title=Congress of the People|accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister’s Cabinet reshuffle|url=http://www.caribbean360.com/index.php/news/trinidad_tobago_news/591871.html#axzz1z1ZPfcil|publisher=Caribbean360|accessdate=27 June 2012|date=25 June 2012|quote=The high profile former Minister of Finance Winston Dookeran has also now been transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Born in 1943, in [[Rio Claro, Trinidad and Tobago|Rio Claro]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], he is one of the seven children of Mewalal and Sumintra Dookeran. Dookeran received his early education in Trinidad.&lt;ref&gt;http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/senate/hdr/1054.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
The young Winston Dookeran attended the prestigious [[Naparima College]] in [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago|San Fernando]], Trinidad.

He then went on to attend the [[University of Manitoba]], [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba, Canada, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Honours [[Economics]] in 1966. It was there that Dookeran made his first entry into politics and he served as the president of the University of Manitoba Students' Union

He subsequently attended the [[London School of Economics]], where he obtained his master's degree in Economics in 1969.

==Economist and politician==
Dookeran spent some fifteen years as a lecturer at the Department of Economics at the [[University of the West Indies]]. In 1981 Dookeran contested the constituency of [[Chaguanas]] as a candidate of the [[United Labour Front]]. He was victorious at the polls and was therefore elected as a Member of Parliament, and served in the [[House of Representatives of Trinidad and Tobago]].

in 1986,when the ULF merged with other parties to form the [[National Alliance for Reconstruction]] (NAR), Dookeran again contested the constituency of Chaguanas, and won. Under the leadership of [[Arthur Napoleon Raymond Robinson]], the NAR had massive success at the polls, winning an unprecedented thirty-three of the thirty six constituencies. Dookeran was made a Cabinet member as he was appointed Minister of Planning and Mobilization.

Dookeran later became Deputy Political Leader of the NAR was a senior member of the government, and acted on several occasions as Prime Minister, most notably during the [[Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt|attempted coup of 1990]] when Prime Minister [[A.N.R. Robinson]] was held hostage by the [[Jamaat al Muslimeen]].

Dookeran lost his seat in the [[Elections in Trinidad and Tobago#1991 General Elections|1991 elections]].

He later became Senior Economist at the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]] (UNECLAC). He was also a member of the Executive Board of the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IADB) and the governor of the [[Caribbean Development Bank]] (CDB).

In July 1997 he was appointed as Governor of the [[Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago]]. He held that post till 2002. Later that year he joined the [[United National Congress]] and won the St Augustine constituency. In October 2005 Dookeran succeeded [[Basdeo Panday]] as [[political leader]] of the [[United National Congress]] after being nominated by Panday unopposed. He would later form his own political party, the Congress of the People(COP), that in coalition with his former party would contest and win the May 2010 snap elections.

Dookeran was then appointed Minister of Finance for the new People's Partnership coalition government and has since begun a series of programmes designed to jumpstart the stagnant economy. His stewardship was confirmed by Standard and Poor's rating of Trinidad and Tobago as AA- with a stable outlook in December 2011. In June 2012, Dookeran was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, a portfolio he held until June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ttparliament.org/members.php?mid=26&amp;pid=6&amp;id=WDO01|title=Trinidad and Tobago Parliament|website=www.ttparliament.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
