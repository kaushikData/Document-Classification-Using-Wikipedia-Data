There are two [[professional association]]s responsible for regulation of [[accountancy]] in [[Portugal]].

==Ordem dos Técnicos Oficiais de Contas==
'''Ordem dos Técnicos Oficiais de Contas''' (OTOC) runs an admittance [[Test (assessment)|examination]] every four months and everyone that passes it becomes a Técnico Oficial de Contas (TOC), the authorized tax and accountancy practitioner in Portugal.

OTOC, which is the largest Portuguese professional body, with more than 75,000 affiliates, offers a broad range of training programs to its members, and is an active member in the public discussion of accounting and finance issues.

==Ordem dos Revisores Oficiais de Contas==
'''Ordem dos Revisores Oficiais de Contas''' (OROC) confers the national qualification for auditors (ROC).

OROC is the national member of [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ifac.org/about/member-bodies IFAC members and associates]. Retrieved 2013-03-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfredo Lardelli''' (1955 or 1956 – 21 July 2015), alias '''Alfredo Borgatte dos Santos''', was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[entrepreneur]], who – according to himself - worked “30 percent as a [[legal advice|legal adviser]], 30 percent as an [[estate agent]] and 40 percent as an adviser for the [[red-light district|red light]]-scene”.&lt;ref name="tagi04"&gt;[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/dyn/news/print/zuerich/411777.html Drohte Lardelli mit Tod?] [[Tages-Anzeiger]], September 3, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He gained his knowledge about [[jurisprudence]] [[autodidactic]]ally. 

He became known to a broad public thanks to the media reporting about his various lawsuits.
In 1989, Lardelli was sentenced to twenty years in [[prison]] for murdering two prostitutes and the husband of his then-girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/10/swiss-shooting-leaves-several-deead Swiss shooting leaves several dead] The Guardian, 10 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In prison, he married a [[Brazil]]ian woman and adopted her family name, Borgatte dos Santos. After his early discharge in 1999 due to good behaviour, he had a big media presence, e.g. in Swiss TV and in [[rainbow press]]-paper ''[[Blick]]'', which dedicated a series to him that lasted six issues.&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Fehr, [http://www.weltwoche.ch/ausgaben/2002-42/artikel-2002-42-der-froehliche-m.html Der fröhliche Mörder], [[Die Weltwoche]] 42/02&lt;/ref&gt;
Lardelli wanted to open up an establishment in [[Wagen]] (Gemeinde [[Jona]]). This led to various legal arguments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zsz.ch/storys/storys_archiv.cfm?vID=1132 Streit geht in die nächste Runde] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928070541/http://www.zsz.ch/storys/storys_archiv.cfm?vID=1132 |date=2007-09-28 }}, [[Linth-Zeitung]], August 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Lardelli had to appear in court, because he supposedly threatened to kill an opponent of his project.&lt;ref name="tagi04"/&gt;
In 2006 and inspired by Lardelli, legal actions were taken against [[Ueli Maurer]], president of political party [[Schweizerische Volkspartei|SVP]], because of alleged falsification of documents; Maurer was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/dyn/news/schweiz/683330.html Freispruch für Ueli Maurer], Tages-Anzeiger Online, November 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lardelli died of multiple organ failure in 2015 at the age of 59.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzz.ch/newsticker/schillernde-milieu-figur-dreifachmoerder-alfredo-lardelli-gestorben-1.18583376|title=Schillernde Milieu-Figur: Dreifachmörder Alfredo Lardelli gestorben|date=21 July 2015|work=Neue Zürcher Zeitung|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business process outsourcing to India''' refers to the [[business process outsourcing]] services in the outsourcing industry in India, catering mainly to Western operations of [[multinational corporation]]s (MNCs).

As of 2012, around 2.8 million people work in outsourcing sector.&lt;ref name="feout"/&gt; Annual revenues are around $11 billion,&lt;ref name="feout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/indias-outsourcing-revenue-to-hit-50-bn/266661/|title=India's outsourcing revenue to hit $50 bn|publisher=Financial Express|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; around 1% of GDP. Around 2.5 million people graduate in India every year. Wages are rising by 10–15 percent as a result of skill shortage.&lt;ref name="feout"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Gurgoan5.JPG|thumb|right|A BPO hub in DLF Cyber City in [[Gurgaon]], India.]]

===Amex===
In the second half of the 1980s, [[American Express]] consolidated its JAPAC (Japan and Asia Pacific) [[back office]] operations into [[Gurgaon]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanexpress.com/india/customerservice/contactamex_phone.shtml Amex Phone and Address listings]&lt;/ref&gt; This centre (called the Financial Resource Centre East or FRC-E)was headed by an Expat Harry Robertson, a veteran American Express employee with Raman Roy reporting to him, Raman Roy later on quit Amex to join GE and later on started his own enterprise called Spectramind which got later on merged with Wipro and then later on started [[Quatrro]] BPO.

===General Electric===
In the 1990s [[Jack Welch]] was influenced by [[K.P. Singh]], (a Delhi-based realtor) to look at [[Gurgaon]] in the NCR region as a base for back office operations. [[Pramod Bhasin]], the India head of G.E. hired Raman Roy and several of his management from American Express to start this enterprise called [[GECIS]] (GE Capital International Services). Raman for the first time tried out voice operations out of India. The operations in India were the Beta site for the GE [[Six sigma]] enterprise, as well. The results made GE ramp up their Indian presence and look at other locations. In 2004 GECIS was spun off as a separate legal entity by GE, called [[Genpact]]. GE has retained a 40% stake and sold a 60% stake for $500 million to two equity companies, [[Oak Hill Capital Partners]] and [[General Atlantic Partners]]..
[[File:Infosys India.JPG|thumb|250px|'''IT:''' The headquarters of [[Infosys]], India's third largest IT company, is located in Bengaluru]]

===Third party BPOs===
Until G.E. most of the work was being done by "captives"- a term used for in house work being done for the parent organisation. In 2000 Raman Roy and some team members from GECIS quit, and with VC funding from Chrysalis Capital, started Spectramind. At the same time, an organisation called Efunds started in Mumbai and Gurgaon, vCustomer in New Delhi and Daksh in Gurgaon. One of the current big BPO firms, EXL Services, started in April 1999, and in 2012 hit $442.9 million in revenues.

However, recently, most of the Indian BPOs, even smaller and mid-sized ones, are setting up their onshore presence in the markets they serve. Most of the large players are improving the outsourced business processes by leveraging on their years of experience, and now some are offering more than just plain vanilla BPO processes. KPO, transformation and Consulting opportunities are gaining favour among large third party BPO providers like Genpact, Infosys BPM, WNS and EXL Services.

===Future of outsourcing services to India===
Analysts believe that India remains a vital destination for outsourcing and expect its annual GDP to grow at 8–10% for the next decade. In addition, outsourcing efforts to India are held up as an effective remedy for concerns about both Chinese government policy and labour force issues, such as increasing costs and shortages.

==Size of the industry ==

The industry has been growing rapidly. It grew at a rate of 38% over 2005.  For the FY06 financial year the projections is of US$7.2 billion worth of services provided by this industry. The base in terms of headcount being roughly 400,000 people directly employed in this Industry.  The global BPO Industry is estimated to be worth 120–150 billion dollars, of this the offshore BPO is estimated to be some US$11.4 billion. India thus has some 5–6% share of the total Industry, but a commanding 63% share of the offshore component.  The U.S $7.2 billion also represents some 20% of the IT and BPO Industry which is in total expected to have revenues worth US$36 billion for 2006. The headcount at 400,000 is some 40% of the approximate one million workers estimated to be directly employed in the IT and BPO Sector.

The related Industry dependent on this are Catering, BPO training and recruitment, transport vendors (home pick up and drops for night shifts being the norm in the industry), security agencies, facilities management companies.

== Registration of BPO as OSP ==
BPO/KPO/Domestic &amp; International Call Centres/NOC etc. are covered under the 'Other Service Provider' (OSP) Category by the Department of Telecommunications.

The companies who are providing the 'Applications Services' means providing services like tele-banking, tele-medicine, tele-education, tele-trading, e-commerce, call centre, network operation centre and other IT Enabled Services, by using Telecom Resources provided by

[[Bangalore]], [[Chennai]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Gurgaon]], [[National Capital Region (India)|NCR]], [[Ahmedabad]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Pune]] are Tier I cities that are leading IT cities in India.

With rising infrastructure costs in these cities, many BPO's are shifting operations to Tier II cities like [[Nashik]], [[Sangli]], [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] (Maharashtra), [[Mangalore]], [[Mysore]], [[Hubli-Dharwad]], [[Belgaum]], [[Coimbatore]], [[Nagpur]], [[Trichy]], [[Kochi, India|Kochi]], [[Trivandrum]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Mohali]], [[Panchkula]], [[Bhubaneshwar]], [[Jaipur]], [[Visakhapatnam]], [[Raipur]] and [[Lucknow]].

Tier II cities offer lower [[business process overhead]] compared to Tier I cities, but have a less reliable infrastructure system which may hamper dedicated operations. The [[Government of India]] in partnership with private infrastructure corporations is working on bringing all around development and providing robust infrastructure all over the nation.

==Criticisms==

The BPO industry in India has attracted criticism from some observers.

* Shehzad Nadeem, of the Sociology Department at Lehman College, City University of New York, reports that Indian call-centre employees, to confirm to expectations of the US consumers who they support long-distance, are expected to imitate the Western employees they have replaced in terms of the use of US vernacular, even temporarily adopting an Anglo name during the call. While this is true, Nadeem claims further that this temporary switch to an American-like identity inflicts psychological distress, and has led to the adoption of Western-style-consumer lifestyles by the employees, who earn far more than their compatriots.&lt;ref&gt;Nadeem, Shehzad (2011). ''Dead Ringers:How Outsourcing is Changing the Way Indians Understand Themselves'', Princeton University Press, New Jersey. {{ISBN|0691147876}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jyoti Saraswati of the Stern School of Business, New York University, claims that the outsourcing industry's political influence far exceeds the industry's economic contribution, and has allowed the industry to secure the support and resources of the Indian state ahead of other sectors of the national economy where the developmental returns would be far greater.&lt;ref&gt;Saraswati, Jyoti (2012). ''Dot.compradors: Power and Policy in the Development of the Indian Software Industry'', Pluto Press, London. {{ISBN|9780745332659}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another point that should be considered while outsourcing, not only to India but any other region, is Intellectual Property Protection. When companies outsource their work, they have to dilute their core knowledge related to process before transferring the diluted knowledge to the outsourcee. If they fail to do this, the outsourcee can learn enough about the outsourcing organization's business to compete with them later by offering similar services in their own country or even multi-nationally.

==History==
On 30 June 2016, Xerox announced that it would be spinning off its Xerox Business Services division into a wholly separate corporation, for which the name was yet to be determined.  The business scope of the new company was generally understood to be essentially identical to that of former business services company [[Affiliated Computer Services]] (ACS), which Xerox had acquired six years earlier in 2010.&lt;ref name="burke"&gt;Burke, Patrick (2016-07-13). Burke: Xerox spinoff Conduent a likely takeover target. Democrat and Chronicle, 13 July 2016. Retrieved from http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/money/columnist/burke/2016/07/13/xerox-conduent-carl-icahn-takeover/87026628/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="farrell"&gt;Farrell, Maureen (2016-01-29).

On 6 October 2016, having previously announced its intent to separate into two separate companies, Xerox announced the identity of the new business services company as Conduent. It described the company's "coined name" as "inspired by the company's expertise in managing transactional relationships between their clients and their constituents".&lt;ref name="identity"&gt;Xerox (2016-10-06).

Retrieved from https://www.news.xerox.com/news/Xerox-unveils-global-brand-identity-for-Conduent.&lt;/ref&gt; On its corporate blog, Conduent posted an article by chief marketing officer John Kennedy, who described the name as "derived with inspiration from several places". Kennedy wrote that when trying to summarize what the new company does, "words like conduit, confluence and constituent come to mind." He wrote that the company considered nearly 6,000 possible names before choosing Conduent, which he described as "a name that seemed perfect for our new BPO Company."&lt;ref name="kennedy"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.blogs.conduent.com/2016/06/16/whats-in-a-name/ |title=What's in a name? |first=John |last=Kennedy |date=16 June 2016 |publisher=Conduent |accessdate=24 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 January 2017, Conduent formally came into existence following its separation from [[Xerox]].&lt;ref name="jamerson"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/xerox-stock-climbs-after-splitting-with-business-services-unit-1483461921 |title=Xerox Stock Climbs After Splitting With Business-Services Unit |first=Joshua |last=Jamerson |date=January 3, 2017 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=2017-01-04 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the first quarter of 2017, [[Carl Icahn]] owned 9.7% of the company.&lt;ref name=Icahn/&gt;

Following the sale of the company, Bently subsequently remained active in his other family-owned businesses representing a diverse range of interests including [[rotordynamics]], [[agriculture]], [[biofuels]], [[real estate]], [[fluid bearing|externally pressurized fluid bearings]], and machinery diagnostics.

==Education and military service==

He then worked for [[North American Aviation]] and [[Rocketdyne]] in California.  He later completed graduate-level coursework at [[UC Berkeley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpb-co.com/corporate/founder.php|title=Externally Pressurized Porous Gas Bearings – Bently Bearings|website=Bently Bearings|access-date=2013-04-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125075624/http://bpb-co.com/corporate/founder.php|archive-date=2012-01-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while working for an aerospace company. He experimented the [[eddy-current]] sensing technology that was later the foundation of Bently Nevada Corporation.

==Bently Nevada history==

{{main|Bently Nevada}}

During Bently's brief employment in the aerospace industry in the mid-1950s, he assisted with research into the use of electronic sensing technologies for aircraft control systems.  At the time, his employer concluded that there was limited use for the eddy-current technology in aircraft controls.  Bently, however, felt the technology showed commercial promise elsewhere and received permission to use it in his own endeavors.  In 1956, he left to form Bently Scientific Company, manufacturing and selling eddy-current products via mail order from his garage in Berkeley, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Donald  Bently Obituary |url=http://funeralinnovations.com/obituary/95327/Donald-Bently |website=funeralinnovations.com |accessdate=22 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823105708/http://funeralinnovations.com/obituary/95327/Donald-Bently |archive-date=2018-08-23 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1961, Bently relocated the company to Minden, Nevada, and incorporated it there as Bently Nevada Corporation with three people.&lt;ref name=munson/&gt;&lt;ref name="gemc"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.gemeasurement.com/sites/gemc.dev/files/orbit_v33n1_2013_q1.pdf |title=In-Memoriam – The Life of a Great Man |journal=Orbit|page=4|volume=33 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827171915/https://www.gemeasurement.com/sites/gemc.dev/files/orbit_v33n1_2013_q1.pdf |archivedate=August 27, 2018| number=1 | date=January 2013 |publisher= GE Oil &amp; Gas}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bently's primary application of eddy-current technology was for non-contacting displacement sensors.  Often thought of as a type of electronic [[dial indicator]], such sensors are typically used to measure very small distances between the tip of the sensor and a conductive surface, such as rotating shaft.  The displacements measured are extremely small, typically on the order of several thousandths of an inch.  

Initially, Bently's sensors were sold mainly for laboratory rather than industrial measurements.  However, beginning in the early 1960s, users began to experiment with eddy-current sensors for measuring vibration on turbines, compressors, pumps, electric motors, and other [[turbomachinery]].  This application proved to be extremely successful, allowing machinery operators a practical method of observing actual shaft vibratory motion for the first time.  Soon thereafter, Bently augmented his sensors with monitoring instrumentation that accepted his sensors as inputs and provided simple visual indication of the amount of vibration.  Users could set alarm levels for annunication and machine shutdown purposes when vibration levels became excessive.  From that time forward, Bently began to focus his company's efforts almost exclusively on instrumentation for rotating machinery condition measurements.  

In 2001, Bently Nevada built a new $30 million, 283,000-square-foot hadquarters outside Minden at Orchard and Buckeye, previously known as Ferris Heights.&lt;ref name="munson"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Munson |first1=Jeff |title=GE’s purchase of Bently complete |url=https://www.tahoedailytribune.com/news/ges-purchase-of-bently-complete/ |website=Tahoe Daily Tribune |publisher=Tribune News Service |accessdate=22 August 2018 |language=en |date=January 28, 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822213921/https://www.tahoedailytribune.com/news/ges-purchase-of-bently-complete/ |archive-date=2018-08-22 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new location consolidated operations previously located at eight different locations around Carson Valley.&lt;ref name=carter&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carter |first1=Sharon |title=Bently breaks ground for new facility at Science Park |url=https://www.recordcourier.com/news/local/bently-breaks-ground-for-new-facility-at-science-park/ |accessdate=22 August 2018 |language=en |date=December 19, 2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822213915/https://www.recordcourier.com/news/local/bently-breaks-ground-for-new-facility-at-science-park/ |archive-date=2018-08-22 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bently acquired the Buckeye Ranch in 1978, the former location of the Dangberg sheep operation. Bently renamed the location Bently Science Park.&lt;ref name=carter/&gt;

This specialized focus resulted in substantial growth. When Bently sold Bently Nevada to GE Energy in January 2002 for between $600 million and $900 million,&lt;ref name="munson"/&gt; the company had 1,200 people at its headquarters in Minden, Nevada and 2,100 employees worldwide, operated in more than 40 countries, and had global sales exceeding $235 million USD.&lt;ref name="munson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GE Power Systems Completes Acquisition of Bently Nevada |url=http://www.genewsroom.com/press-releases/ge-power-systems-completes-acquisition-of-bently-nevada-270415 |website=GE Newsroom |accessdate=22 August 2018 |language=en |date=25 January 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822214149/http://www.genewsroom.com/press-releases/ge-power-systems-completes-acquisition-of-bently-nevada-270415 |archive-date=2018-08-22 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bently said he sold Bently Nevada so he could concentrate on other interests.

==Other business interests==

Bently founded other businesses, including Bently Pressurized Bearing Company, which manufactured a bearing that can hold a rotating axle in place. The technology injected [[fluid bearing|highly pressurized air]] between the bearing and the rotating machinery, preventing the axle from touching the bearing, virtually eliminating friction.&lt;ref name=twp/&gt; 

=== Bently Rotordynamics  ===

In 1981, Bently established a pure research organization called Bently Rotordynamics Research Corporation (BRDRC or "Birdrock"). BRDRC's objective was to conduct rotordynamic research, furthering the knowledge of rotating machinery behavior, modeling techniques, and malfunction diagnostic methodologies.  Its mission was considered complementary to Bently Nevada, with BRDRC focused on understanding how machinery behaved, and Bently Nevada focused on understanding and building instrumentation to measure machinery behavior. 

BRDRC made a number of important contributions to the field of rotordynamics such as a better understanding of fluid-induced instabilities, advanced models for understanding shaft crack behavior, insight into rubbing malfunctions between stationary and rotating parts, and enhancement of the rotordynamic equations via introduction of a new variable lambda (λ) which denoted the fluid circumferential average velocity ratio and more accurately modeled hydrodynamic effects.  Bently was personally responsible for many of these developments, publishing his work under the auspices of BRDRC. BRDRC also introduced several new data presentation formats, such as so-called "full" spectrum plots and "acceptance region" trend plots. Its research findings were published extensively in relevant technical journals, and the research that had practical commercial applications often found its way into the Bently Nevada product line. In 2002, BRDRC was sold along with Bently Nevada to GE Energy.&lt;ref name="uiowa.edu"/&gt;

=== Other Bently businesses ===

Bently founded Bently Agrowdynamics, which focused on environmentally sustainable agricultural practices and innovative uses of renewable resources. The company led reconstruction of Mud Lake Dam which had been damaged during the 1994 Double Springs Flat earthquake. They converted the 100-year-old earth filled dam to a rock filled structure, ensuring a supply of irrigation water for Bently Agrowdynamics’ South Ranch properties and improving the dam's resistance to earthquakes, protecting the surrounding community.&lt;ref name=uiowa&gt;{{cite web |title=Donald Bently {{!}} College of Engineering {{!}} The University of Iowa |url=https://www.engineering.uiowa.edu/alumni/awards/honor-wall/donald-bently |website=www.engineering.uiowa.edu |accessdate=27 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other businesses included Bently Tribology Services, Bently Biofuels, Gibson Tool and Supply, and RoMaDyn, a mechanical engineering services and diagnostics company.&lt;ref name=wittich/&gt; He also held more than {{convert|38,000|acres}} of agricultural land in and around [[Douglas County, Nevada|Carson Valley, Nevada]] and numerous real estate holdings in the United States and abroad.&lt;ref name="munson"/&gt;

All of Bently's businesses were privately held, allowing him to focus on a long-term strategy without the pressure of quarterly stockholder reports. This also enabled him to keep his company in the front of his field technologically.  He successfully competed against subsidized Japanese companies and from U.S. government-funded entities.&lt;ref name=twp/&gt;

===Founded ISCORMA===

A significant amount of Bently's rotordynamic research efforts were about rotor dynamic stability.  In 2001, he established ISCORMA, (International Symposium on Stability Control of Rotating Machinery), a bi-annual industry event.  Bently was an active organizer and participant in all ISCORMA conferences until his death.&lt;ref name="uiowa.edu"/&gt;

===Work with NASA===

His expertise also led to work for NASA. He spent 2½ years studying the area where the oxygen and hydrogen fuel pumps connect to the main engines on the space shuttle following the January 1986 challenger disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Timko|first=Steve|title=Bently's innovations, inventions benefited many|url=http://www.rgj.com/article/20121007/LIV11/310070048/Bently-s-innovations-inventions-benefited-many?gcheck=1&amp;nclick_check=1|work=Obituary|publisher=Reno Gazette-Journal|accessdate=10 October 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philanthropy and public service ==

Bently was a leader of and major financial supporter if [[The Institute of World Politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Philanthropist and entrepreneur Donald E.

For the first 15 years, he rented the building to the Institute for $1.00 per year. He paid several million dollars to gut and completely renovate the townhouses and later donated them to the Institute. He also endowed the Donald E. Bently Chair of Political Economy.&lt;ref name=twp&gt;{{cite web |title=IWP mourns the passing of longtime supporter Donald E.

Bently supported local schools in Carson Valley. He donated several million dollars to [[Cal Poly State University]] in San Luis Obispo, California, and gave generously to St. Gall Catholic Church, Carson Valley United Methodist Church, and a battered women's shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gardner |first1=Sheila |title=Inventor Don Bently remembered by more than 500 at memorial |url=https://www.nevadaappeal.com/news/local/inventor-don-bently-remembered-by-more-than-500-at-memorial/ |accessdate=27 August 2018 |language=en |date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He helped fund the building of the new {{convert|38,338|sqft}} museum facility  built in 2010 at the [[Seabee Museum and Memorial Park|U.S. Navy Seabee Museum]] at Port Hueneme, California. In 2005, he helped create a [[conservation easement]] with the [[Nature Conservancy]] that preserved the Kirman Field in northern Douglas County.&lt;ref name=rc2012&gt;{{cite web |title=Minden industrialist, philanthropist Don Bently dead at age 87 |url=https://www.recordcourier.com/news/local/minden-industrialist-philanthropist-don-bently-dead-at-age-87/ |accessdate=27 August 2018 |language=en |date=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also supported the Friends of Pine Creek Grist Mill, Muscatine Junior College and its Alumni Association, Muscatine Community College, the Lucille A. Carver Mississippi River Environmental Research Station Fund, and the University of Iowa.&lt;ref name=findagrave/&gt;

'''Edvin Leonard Bergroth''' (26 December 1836 – 29 March 1917) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[engineer]], [[businessman]] and [[vuorineuvos]].

Bergroth studied engineering in [[Hanover]]. After returning to Finland, he worked for the [[VR Group|Finnish State Railways]] and a [[gasworks]], until he moved to [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1801–1917)|Caucasus]] to work for [[Branobel]]. When he got back to Finland in 1890, he worked in many companies. Bergroth managed the newly re-established [[Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstad|Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works]] in 1895–1900.

Between 1905 and 1915 Bergroth was board member of [[Tampella|Tampere Linen and Iron Industry]]. As a chairman, he initiated several development projects which grew the company and improved its productivity.

Bergroth was married twice. Four of his children lived until adult age.

== Early life and studies ==
Bergroth's parents were [[Pihlajavesi, Keuruu|Pihlajavesi]] [[chaplain]] Johan Mikael Bergroth and Emma Lovisa [[née]] Cajanus; the father died when Bergroth was just six years old. He did his [[Matriculation exam (Finland)|matriculation exam]] in [[Vaasa|Nikolaistad]] [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in 1857 and went to study engineering. After getting a [[scholarship]] he continued in [[University of Hanover|Hanover Polytechnic School]] in [[Prussia]] in 1858 and graduated [[engineer]] in 1860.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Edvin Bergroth I"/&gt;

== Career in Hanover, Helsinki and Caucasus ==
Bergroth worked for the Royal Prussian [[Mint (facility)|Mint]] in Hanover until 1861, and, upon returning to Finland, for a short time for the [[VR Group|Finnish State Railways]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Edvin Bergroth I"/&gt; Bergroth managed construction of Leppäkoski railway bridge in 1862.&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.141-151"/&gt; In the same year Bergroth was appointed [[Technical Manager]] of [[Helsinki]] Gas Illumination Company. The company was a private [[monopoly]], that had been granted in 1860 an exclusive permit for street illumination until 1900 in those areas of Helsinki, where it had built the network.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Edvin Bergroth I"/&gt; Bergroth travelled to Germany and Switzerland for a field trip visiting the local gas works and collecting knowledge.&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.141-151"/&gt; At the time he left the company in 1884, he had become its manager. Bergroth moved to [[Branobel]] in [[Baku]], [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1801–1917)|Caucasus]], where he got a Technical Manager vacance. Bergroth got back to Finland in 1890, after which he worked for a number of companies. Until 1892 he was inspector in Finnish Sawmills Fire Assistance Association. One of the employers was [[Nokia]], where he worked from 1890 until 1913. By time Bergroth gained reputation as [[businessman]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Edvin Bergroth I"/&gt; When [[Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstad|Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works]] was re-established after [[bankruptcy]] on 18 November 1895, Bergroth was selected its first manager.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Edvin Bergroth I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.48-57"&gt;Osakeyhtiö Hietalahden...: ''Laivatelakka osakeyhtiönä.'' pp. 48–57.&lt;/ref&gt; During his leadership the company enlarged its premises and invested heavily on facilities and machinery. Considering the limited amount of capital and the market situation, Bergroth's management was successful. He left his position in 1900 but continued as board member after that.&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.48-57"/&gt;

By the 1880s city of Helsinki had become increasingly dissatisfied on Bergroth's old employer, the gas illumination company, which was unwilling to invest on new light technology and produced gas inefficiently by burning wood. In November 1899 the city took over the gas distribution; Bergroth was appointed to the board of the new City of Helsinki Illumination Works.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Edvin Bergroth I"/&gt;

== Tampere Linen and Iron Industry ==
In 1905 Bergroth became board member in [[Tampella|Tampere Linen and Iron Industry]] company and in the following year he became chairman of board. The company underwent thorough renewal under Bergroth's chairmanship, and many of the changes were initiated by him. The company invested on new buildings and machinery for linen production, increasing both capacity and productivity. During the economic upswing prior to [[First World War]], the company invested on production of various yarn types, [[canvas]], [[sailcloth]] and [[plain weave]] for bedclothes. The investments continued also during the war, when new linen storage and [[weaving]] facility were built. Bergroth left the board in 1915.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Edvin Bergroth I"/&gt;

== Political career ==
Bergroth was member of [[Helsinki City Council]] in 1875–1877, 1880–1882 and 1897–1899. He represented Helsinki [[bourgeoisie]] in [[Diet of Finland]] in 1882 and 1899. Bergroth took part in number of state committees, Swedish-speaking technical association, &lt;!-- Tekniska Föreningen i Finland --&gt; [[voluntary fire brigade]] activities and [[Charity (practice)|charity]] work.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Edvin Bergroth I"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1864 Bergroth got married to Lydia née von Essen, daughter of [[professor]] [[Carl Gustaf von Essen]] and Catalina Sofia née Arppe. Between 1865–1871 they got three daughters and four sons. After Lydia Bergroth's death in 1872, he was married to Evelina née Bergroth, whose parents were [[vicar]] Carl Edvard Bergroth and Carolina Amalia née Stenbäck. They got one son in 1876. In total, four of Bergroth's children survived until adult age.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Edvin Bergroth I"/&gt;

Bergroth has been characterised as a warm-hearted person.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Edvin Bergroth I"/&gt;

'''Georg Fugger''' ''von der Lilie'' (1453&amp;ndash;1506) was a German merchant of the [[Fugger]] dynasty.

==Life==
[[File:Giovanni_Bellini_-_Portrait_of_Joerg_Fugger_(1474).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Portrait of Georg Fugger]]'' by Giovanni Bellini, 1474]]
A son of [[Jakob Fugger the Elder]] and his wife [[Barbara Bäsinger]] (whose sons also included [[Ulrich Fugger the Elder|Ulrich]] and [[Jakob Fugger|Jakob the Younger]]), Georg was born and died in [[Augsburg]]; it became clear early in life that he would become a merchant. The "Ulrich Fugger und seine Gesellschaft" (Ulrich Fugger and his company) firm was the first general partnership in Europe and soon changed its name to the "Ulrich Fugger und Gebrüder von Augsburg" (Ulrich Fugger and Brothers of Augsburg) when Georg joined it. Ulrich headed its headquarters in Augsburg, with Georg heading its [[Nuremberg]] branch and Jakob handling international affairs. 

The firm was so successful that Georg was able to commission [[Portrait of Georg Fugger|his portrait]] from the Venetian painter [[Giovanni Bellini]] in 1474. In 1494 the firm made over 54,000 Guilders and the three brothers were also co-founders of the [[Fuggerei]], the oldest social housing project in the world. The House of "Fugger vom Reh" also ran a different Fugger firm at this time, though this was soon to go bankrupt.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1486, he married [[Imhoff family|Regina Imhoff]], daughter of a patrician of Nuremberg. Their son Markus (Marx) was born in 1488, followed by [[Raymund Fugger|Raymund]] in 1489. These sons made Georg the founder of the "von Kirchberg" and "von [[Weißenhorn]]" lines of the Fugger family. Another son, [[Anton Fugger|Anton]], was born in 1493 – he later became head of Jakob Fugger the Younger's family business and founder of the "von Glött" and "von [[Babenhausen, Bavaria|Babenhausen]]" princely lines of the Fugger family. This makes Georg Fugger the founder of all the extant lines of the house of "Fugger von der Lilie".

'''Girma Wake''' (born 13 July 1943) is an [[airline]] industry executive, and was CEO of [[Ethiopian Airlines]] from 2004 to 2011. &lt;ref name=Nazret&gt;{{cite web|title=How Girma Wake Changed Ethiopian Airlines |url=http://nazret.com/blog/index.php/2011/01/04/ethiopia-how-girma-wake-changed-ethiopian-airlines |work=4 January He 2011 |publisher=Nazret.com |accessdate=8 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224102656/http://nazret.com/blog/index.php/2011/01/04/ethiopia-how-girma-wake-changed-ethiopian-airlines |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as the chairman of the Board of Directors of [[Rwandair]] until 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web| title=RwandAir gets new board chair|url=http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/read/223377| date=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Early life and education==
Girma was born in 1943 in [[Yeka]] district, [[Addis Ababa]]. He attended the Dejazmatch Wondiyirad School and then the Kotebe Teacher's College.&lt;ref name=Zoom&gt;{{cite web|title=Girma Wake|url=http://www.zoominfo.com/p/Girma-Wake/325819723|publisher=Zoom Info|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Addis Ababa University|University College of Addis Ababa]], then the country's only higher education institution. &lt;ref name=Zoom /&gt; He was recruited in his second year by the airline. 

==Career==
Girma joined [[Ethiopian Airlines]] upon his graduation in 1965. At the time, the airline was dominated by [[Americans]], primarily from [[TWA]], which had assisted in the airline's development. Girma was one of the first Ethiopians to rise in the airline's executive hierarchy.&lt;ref name=Zoom /&gt; Girma stayed at the airline for nearly three decades, until debates in 1993 between the new [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] government and the airline leadership led to several resignations, including that of Girma.

In November 2003, [[Seyoum Mesfin]], chairman of Ethiopian Airlines, and then-[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ethiopia)|minister of foreign affairs]], offered Girma, then at [[Gulf Air]] as head of cargo operations, the position of Ethiopian Airlines' CEO. Girma, then 60, was at first reluctant to take the position, but he eventually relented with the intention for only staying in the post for five years and also serving the carrier without government interference under his leadership. &lt;ref name=Nazret /&gt;

When Girma became CEO in February 2004, Ethiopian Airlines had only twelve [[jetliners]]. It carried 1.2 million passengers annually to 42 international and 16 domestic destinations. Girma spent most of 2004 devising a plan with the assistance from the local branch of [[Ernst and Young]]. The plan that was formulated was, Vision 2010 that was launched in 2005, however the plan was received with skepticism. Despite this, between 2005 and 2010 the airline grew at an average rate of 25% per annum. &lt;ref name=Nazret /&gt; The 1.2 million passengers the airline used to carry annually when Girma took office almost tripled and now stood at 3.2 million by the end of the plan. The 12 planes the airline had increased by more than three-fold to 37, and the airline's fleet was one of the youngest globally. &lt;ref name=Nazret /&gt; The airline went from having one codeshare agreement to becoming as a member of [[Star Alliance]], which it joined in 2011. 

Under Girma, Ethiopian Airlines Girma’s created 1,500 new jobs including 250 for foreigners.The profits the airline has made have significantly raised employees’ incomes, by an average of 167 percent. Ethiopian also increased its presence in other African markets, forming a strategic partnership with the West African [[ASKY Airlines]], in which it has a 45% stake. &lt;ref name=Nazret /&gt; 

After he stepped down in 2011 mostly due to conflict with authorities on the investigation of the crashed flight [[ET 409]] which crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, shortly after it departed [[Beirut–Rafic Hariri International Airport]], killing all 90 people on board and was immediately replaced by [[Tewolde Gebremariam]], he became chairman of the United Insurance Company. In 2012, he became chairman of [[Rwandair]], the flag carrier of [[Rwanda]]. &lt;ref name=Sports&gt;{{cite news|author=Mamo Gebrehiwot|title=Girma Wake resigns from United Insurance Board|url=http://www.ethiosports.com/2012/10/13/girma-wake-resigns-from-united-insurance-board/|accessdate=8 September 2013|newspaper=EthioSports.com|date=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barra joined American technology company [[Google]] in [[London]] in March 2008 as Group Product Manager for the [[Google Mobile Services|Google Mobile]] team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/changingmediasummit/speaker-hugo-barra|title=Hugo Barra|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Barra joined the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/events/thinkmobile2011/bios.html |title=Speaker Bios |work=Google |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727231423/http://www.google.com/events/thinkmobile2011/bios.html |archivedate=27 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was promoted to Vice President in 2012.

===Xiaomi===
In September 2013, Barra left [[Google]] for Chinese electronics company [[Xiaomi]], serving as Vice President of International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingsd.com/20130912/exclusive-hugo-barra-talks-about-his-future-at-xiaomi-and-why-he-left-google/|title=Exclusive: Hugo Barra Talks About His Future at Xiaomi and Why He Really Left Google|work=All Things D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was considered a ‘significant hire’ for Xiaomi, one of the fastest growing manufacturers in China, enhancing international legitimacy to the company by adding a key former Google [[Android (operating system)|Android]] executive to its senior management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/asia/2013/08/29/xiaomi-reportedly-nabs-google-vp-hugo-barra/|title=Xiaomi confirms it has hired Google’s Hugo Barra, who will take up VP Global role from October|work=The Next Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Barra spoke at [[LeWeb]] tech conference in [[Paris, France]] about his impressions of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference|Chinese]] economy and the opportunity it represented for tech companies such as [[Xiaomi]], citing China's 600&amp;nbsp;million internet users, high market caps of recent Chinese IPOs, the massive scale of the top Chinese apps' monthly active users, and the size of companies such as [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba's]] [[Taobao]], a shopping site more than double the size of [[eBay]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/156977/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chinese-tech-in-one-30-minute-video/|title=Everything you need to know about Chinese tech in one 30-minute video|work=Quartz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The talk was widely cited throughout the industry.&lt;ref name="businessinsider.com"/&gt;

In February 2014, Barra announced the launch of the new [[Xiaomi Mi1|Redmi]] and [[Xiaomi Mi3|Mi3]] smartphones in [[Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/asia/2014/02/19/can-chinas-coolest-phone-maker-take-xiaomi-mania-international-we-ask-vp-hugo-barra/|title=Can China’s coolest phone maker take Xiaomi-mania international? We ask VP Hugo Barra|work=The Next Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; then in [[India]]. Global expansion outside of China into surrounding emerging markets is a key initiative for [[Xiaomi]], given the company’s business model to release high performance smartphone products at an affordable consumer price, generating revenue not only from the hardware itself, but the software and internet services provided to the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/asia/2013/09/06/heres-why-you-should-care-about-rising-chinese-smartphone-firm-xiaomi/|title=Here’s why you should care about rising Chinese smartphone firm Xiaomi|work=The Next Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Xiaomi]] co-founder and president [[Lei Jun]], it is "entirely Barra’s job to figure out which region that we should enter next and how."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/asia/2013/09/09/xiaomi-co-founder-on-why-ex-google-exec-barra-and-its-own-firmware-are-key-to-international-success/|title=Xiaomi co-founder on why ex-Google exec Barra and its own firmware are key to international success|work=The Next Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barra has stated intentions to expand next into various countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/xiaomi-world-phone-in-2-years-android-all-the-way-says-hugo-barra/|title=Xiaomi's Hugo Barra: True world phones in 2 years, Android all the way|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Barra visited [[Foxconn]], a Taiwanese manufacturing company with plants in [[Brazil]] and [[Mexico]] responsible for assembling products for various tech brands, indicating plans for [[Xiaomi]] to expand into [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techinasia.com/hugo-barra-teases-xiaomi-foxconn-deal-for-latin-america/|title=Hugo Barra visits Foxconn, teases Xiaomi launches across Latin America |work=techinasia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, Barra announced the launch of the [[Xiaomi#MiPad|MiPad]], a 7.9 inch tablet. "We spent four years working up to the point where we thought we had the right hardware design and software capability to build a world-class tablet," Barra said. "We think we are there, finally." Barra described the release as part of [[Xiaomi|Xiaomi's]] overall strategy to expand both its product lineup and into new international markets including [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Singapore]]. Barra also indicated eventual plans to enter the [[United States|U.S.]] market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thevarguy.com/business-smartphone-and-tablet-technology-solutions/051914/ex-google-whiz-barra-s-influence-showing-xiaomi|title=Ex-Google Whiz Barra’s Influence Showing at Xiaomi |work=thevarguy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, Barra announced his departure from Xiaomi. Barra explained his decision had been strongly motivated by a feeling of detachment from his family and the life he had built up in Silicon Valley. "What I've realized is that the last few years of living in such a singular environment have taken a huge toll on my life and started affecting my health. My friends, what I consider to be my home, and my life are back in Silicon Valley, which is also much closer to my family. Seeing how much I've left behind these past few years, it is clear to me that the time has come to return." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/23/14355260/hugo-barra-is-leaving-xiaomi|title=Hugo Barra is leaving Xiaomi|work=theverge.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are reports that quoted Barra saying that his resignation was prompted by health reasons and some analysts noted that the departure came amid Xiaomi's declining sales in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/895226/hugo-barra-is-leaving-xiaomi-to-lead-up-facebooks-nasdaq-fb-vr-efforts/|title=Hugo Barra is leaving Xiaomi to lead Facebook’s virtual reality division|last=Horwitz|first=Josh|date=26 January 2017|work=Quartz|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2064612/hugo-barra-resigns-xiaomi-says-he-returning-silicon-valley|title=Hugo Barra to leave Xiaomi, return to Silicon Valley from Beijing|last=Soo|first=Zen|date=23 January 2017|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, global expansion has been successful.

===Facebook===
He announced in a Facebook post on 25 January 2017 that he would be joining Facebook as Vice President of virtual reality, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I’m excited to share my next adventure as I return to Silicon Valley—in a couple of months I'll be joining Facebook as VP of virtual reality (VPVR!) and lead the Oculus team. Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun always says that the highest calling of an engineer is to make technology breakthroughs quickly and readily available to the widest possible spectrum of humanity. That will be my mission at Facebook and I look forward to building the future of immersive technology with Mark Zuckerberg, Brendan Trexler Iribe, Mike Schroepfer, and the visionaries in the Oculus team."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/hbarra76/posts/10154020362016612&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Based on his early pronouncements, Barra appears to be focusing on the development of standalone VR headsets as well as social VR. During an appearance at the 2018 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES), he described the technology as "a product category that will help us bring the most number of people into VR and really start unlocking these opportunities for social presence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/16/facebook-hugo-barra-standalone-vr/|title=Facebook's Hugo Barra says standalone headsets are key to social VR|last=Lee|first=Nicole|date=16 January 2018|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the event, Barra announced Oculus' standalone VR headset called Oculus Go, with Xiaomi as global hardware partner.

The '''Institute of Directors''' (IoD) is a business organisation for company directors, senior business leaders and entrepreneurs. It is the UK’s longest running organisation for professional leaders, having been founded in 1903 and incorporated by [[Royal Charter]] in 1906. The IoD, per its mission statement, stands for "[[free enterprise]], [[entrepreneurialism]], wealth creation and good [[corporate governance]]," and represents "the views of businesses and IoD members in the media and with government." {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The IoD is located in the [[Listed building|Grade I-listed building]] at 116 Pall Mall, formerly the [[United Service Club]]. Members of the IoD also gain access to co-working spaces around the UK, bespoke market intelligence, tailored tax and legal support, exclusive member-only events along with discounts on IoD professional development courses and events.

From a high of 55,000 members in 2005, the IoD currently has just over 30,000 full members. Members of the IoD come from companies of all sizes and from all industries {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}. Around 70% work for small and medium-sized enterprises and are typically in senior management and boardroom-level positions while 78% of [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE 100]] companies have an IoD member on their board or in a senior management position.

==History &amp; Royal Charter==

The IoD was founded in 1903 and incorporated by royal charter in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iod.com/about-the-iod/our-royal-charter IoD Royal Charter] Retrieved 29 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The royal charter compels the IoD to:

* Promote for the public benefit high levels of skill, knowledge, professional competence and integrity on the part of directors
* Represent the interests of members and the business community to government and in the public arena
* Encourage and foster a climate favourable to entrepreneurial activity and wealth creation
* Promote the study, research and development of corporate governance

==Membership==

The IoD represents individual members. Every member’s voice carries equal weight within the organisation, and members retain their membership of the IoD throughout their career. This allows the IoD free rein to speak out on behalf of the business community and discuss individual companies in public.

There are currently 30,000 IoD members in the UK and Overseas, with an additional 2,500 student members. Anybody who has an interest in business, is running a business, sits on a board or runs their own company can join the IoD.

In order to help address declining membership the IoD 99 was established in 2015.  This initiative is aimed at members who under the age of 42, and gives a substantial discount on membership fees.  Additionally IoD Advance was launched in March 2016, which gives additional benefits in return for a higher annual subscription.

==Policy==

The IoD represents its members and makes the case for enterprise, entrepreneurialism and business in the public and to government. Working with various stakeholders, the IoD campaigns on issues of importance to its members and the wider business community to build an environment in the UK which supports businesses and makes is easy to start, grow and run a company.

The IoD has experts on tax, infrastructure, law, Europe, corporate governance, financial services, technology, education, skills and regulation, and campaigns on all of these issues.

==Business support==

The IoD’s Information and Advisory Services offer members tailored and bespoke business advice on all aspects of running a business, including unbiased and confidential legal, financial, HR, marketing, and tax support. Members of the IoD can access the support through online, telephone or face-to-face consultations, are allowed up to 25 different consultations each year.

==Training and development==

The IoD is one of the country’s most prestigious training providers, and has a range of courses to suit business leaders at every stage of their career. There are role-specific training courses to equip directors with new skills to take on different roles along with the flagship Chartered Director course. [In other countries Certified Director, e.G. in [http://german-iod.org/ablauf/ Germany]]

Training courses are open to both members and non-members alike, and around 5,000 people take part in an IoD course every year. The IoD networks also provide executive coaching, mentoring services and online learning zones.

==Initiatives and events==

The IoD hosts hundreds of networking, policy and social events throughout the year and across the country.

===Annual Convention===

[[Image:Julia Gillard Mackworth 2015.jpg|thumb|right|[[Julia Gillard]] delivers the inaugural Mackworth Lecture at the IoD, 2015]]

The Annual Convention is the flagship IoD event and a fixture of the business calendar and has historically taken place at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] each year. It draws some of the biggest business names and politicians and leaders from across the world. The convention has taken place every year since 1950. Nine different prime ministers have addressed the convention on more than eighteen occasions along with pioneers such as [[Jimmy Wales]], co-founder of [[Wikipedia]], and [[Richard Branson]], serial entrepreneur, and members of the British royal family, including the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] and the [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]. The last Annual Convention took place in September 2016 and included former Greece finance minister [[Yanis Varoufakis]], Lord [[Norman Lamont]] of Lerwick, global economist [[Dambisa Moyo]], and [[Nicola Sturgeon]].

Owing to declining ticket and sponsorship revenues the Annual Convention took a year's break in 2017.  It will take on a new look in March 2018, with the format and speaker line-up to be confirmed.

===Rhondda Lecture===

In 2015, the IoD launched the annual Rhondda Lecture, in honour of Viscountess Rhondda, the first female President of the IoD. The lecture celebrates radical thought, leadership, bold ideas and activism. [[Julia Gillard]], former Australian prime minister delivered the inaugural lecture in June 2015 at 116 Pall Mall to an audience of politicians, academics, and business leaders. [[Ruth Davidson]], leader of the Scottish Conservative party, gave the 2016 lecture and was interviewed by BBC journalist [[Laura Kuenssberg]] at 116 Pall Mall in December.

==''Director'' magazine==

''Director'' is a business and lifestyle magazine for business leaders. It is circulated bi-monthly, is free to IoD members and available to purchase through subscription. It contains interviews with business leaders and politicians, updates from the IoD, debates on topical issues, reviews and features.  In April 2017 it was announced that the editorial, advertising and production functions of the magazine will be transferred over to SevenC3, a contract publisher.  As a result, a number of members of staff were made redundant.  This was followed by an announcement in October 2017 that the magazine would be cut back to only six issues per year.

==Structure &amp; key people==

The IoD is made up of regional divisions and branches across the UK which serve as the local point of contact for IoD members. At the national level, the IoD is governed by a board and a council, which serves as the voice of IoD members.

Stephen Martin is the director general, having succeeded [[Simon Walker (business)|Simon Walker]] in October 2016.

[[Barbara, Lady Judge]]&lt;!--her name as listed in the official London Gazette on 12 June 2010 when she received her CBE--&gt; became the IoD's first female chairman in May 2015. She promised to champion women and work to boost the number of women in senior executive positions across British business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/946a13d4-ce5f-11e4-900c-00144feab7de.html Lady Judge stirs things up at the UK’s Institute of Directors] Retrieved 29 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, it was announced that she would be succeeded by [[Charlotte Valeur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/02/institute-of-directors-appoints-charlotte-valeur-as-chair|title=Charlotte Valeur succeeds Barbara Judge as IoD chair|first=Rupert|last=Jones|date=2 September 2018|website=the Guardian|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally there are different organizations with the same target. In Germany, the [[ Deutsches Institut der Aufsichtsräte]] exists as an active non profit organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://german-iod.org|title=Deutsches Institut der Aufsichtsräte|author=|date=|website=Deutsches Institut der Aufsichtsräte|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==116 Pall Mall==

The IoD occupy the Grade I listed 116 Pall Mall in London, which is open to members of the IoD, and has rooms and function suites available for commercial hire. The building is owned by the [[Crown Estate]], along with the large collection of artwork that decorates the rooms. Until 1978, the building was run by the [[United Services Club]]. The building was designed by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], the 19th-century architect who also designed the [[Brighton Pavilion]] and [[Marble Arch]], and constructed between 1826-28.

Between 2001 and 2014, members also had use of 123 Pall Mall. This was opened as a contemporary meeting space in contrast with the more traditional 116 Pall Mall, and the interiors were created by noted designers Wayne and Geraldine Hemingway. Despite its popularity with members, the building was closed in 2014 as part of cost saving measures.

116 Pall Mall has been used as a location for many films and TV programmes, including ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'', ''[[Foyle's War]]'', "[[Downton Abbey]]", "[[The Ali G Show]]", "[[Parks and Recreation]]" and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2141">An {{nihongo|'''intermediary corporation''' or '''intermediate corporation'''|中間法人|chūkan hōjin}} is a type of [[corporation]] which existed under [[Japanese law]] from 2002 until 2008. It was superseded by the {{nihongo|[[general corporation]]|一般社団法人|ippan shadan hōjin}} on December 1, 2008.

The intermediary corporation was designed to bridge the gap between [[Company|companies]] which work for profits and [[NGO]] and other nonprofit organizations which work for public interest. Prior to the enforcement of the law on April 1, 2002, excepting the labor union whose establishing rules were regulated under specific laws, voluntary groups such as a condo association board and hobby club were operated under informal agreements and their assets were registered with one or more of group members. However, this meant that in the absence or negligence of the goodwill by the member registering assets, group's assets could be appropriated without becoming a criminal case. While they could be reclaimed through a civil suit, this does not resolve the problem of the ownership of assets. The intermediary corporation and its associated laws were designed to protect the group's assets while limiting the potential of lawsuits against individual members.

There were two types of intermediary corporations. {{nihongo|Limited liability intermediary corporations|有限責任中間法人|yūgen sekinin chūkan hōjin}} were designed to resemble [[yugen kaisha|yūgen kaisha]] (limited companies) in formation and function, while {{nihongo|unlimited liability intermediary corporations|無限責任中間法人|mugen sekinin chūkan hōjin}} were closer to [[Gōmei gaisha | gomei kaisha]] (general partnership corporations).

'''Jilani Humayun''' is a [[Pakistani American|Pakistani-American]] [[arms trafficking|arms trader]] who was arrested in [[New York City]] on July 19, 2007, and [[Indictment|charged]] in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] with 11 counts of violating the [[Law of the United States|federal]] [[Arms Export Control Act]], one count of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit [[mail fraud]] and one count of conspiracy to commit [[money laundering]].&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news | title = Weapons export arrest made in New York | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-07-19-illegal-arms-export_N.htm?csp=34 | date = 2007-07-20 | accessdate = 2007-07-20 | publisher = [[The Associated Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, while employed with an aviation parts employer, Humayun applied to the [[United States Department of State]] Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) for an export license to send certain military equipment to an unidentified company in [[Malaysia]]. The application indicated that the Malaysian company was planning to forward the parts to the [[Saudi Arabia]]n [[Military of Saudi Arabia|Ministry of Defense and Aviation]]. The DDTC advised that the application was denied because the Malaysian company was an unreliable recipient of items on the [[United States Munitions List]].&lt;ref name=PRNewswire&gt;{{cite news | title = Long Island Man Arrested for Illegally Exporting F-5 and F-14 Fighter Jet Components | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=/www/story/07-19-2007/0004629165&amp;EDATE= | date = 2007-07-19 | accessdate = 2007-07-20 | publisher = [[PR Newswire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2004, Humayun formed his own company, '''Vash International, Inc.''', to engage in the business of export management for defense and logistic support, including [[tank]]s, [[guided missile]]s and [[multiple rocket launcher|rocket launcher]]s. Then, on 11 separate occasions between January 2004 and May 2006, Humayun, via Vash International, exported to the Malaysian company [[Northrop F-5]] and [[F-14 Tomcat]] fighter jet parts and [[CH-47 Chinook]] [[helicopter]] parts. According to [[United States Attorney]] [[Michael J. Garcia]], it is documented in public reports that the sole customer of F-14 parts is the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force|Iranian Air Force]].&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; Neither Humayun nor Vash International applied for or received the export license required to send the parts included in the 11 shipments outside the United States.&lt;ref name=PRNewswire/&gt;

Humayun admitted that, at the Malaysian company's request, he undervalued the shipments on his export paperwork so that the Malaysian company could avoid paying Malaysian customs duties.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; This conduct forms the basis for the mail fraud conspiracy charged. Humayun is also charged with a money laundering conspiracy relating to the Malaysian company's [[wire transfer]] payments totaling [[United States dollar|US$]]357,085 to Vash International.&lt;ref name=PRNewswire/&gt;

[[Magistrate#Federal judicial system|U.S. Magistrate Judge]] Ronald L. Ellis denied a request by a prosecutor to order Humayun held without [[bail]]. The judge set bond at US$500,000 and ordered Humayun detained at his home in [[Lynbrook, New York]] after Humayun's lawyer, Joyce London, described her client as a "true New Yorker" who rarely traveled and had visited Pakistan only once since coming to the United States in 1981.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

The arrest of Jilani Humayun followed action taken against [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]], another Pakistani arms trader, who was also involved in smuggling components to rogue states via Malaysia (see main article: [[Scomi Precision Engineering nuclear scandal]]).

'''''Keeping Up with the Kardashians''''' (often abbreviated '''''KUWTK''''') is an American [[reality television]] series that airs on the [[E!]] cable network. The show focuses on the personal and professional lives of the Kardashian–Jenner [[Stepfamily|blended family]]. Its premise originated with [[Ryan Seacrest]], who also serves as an [[executive producer]]. The series debuted on October 14, 2007 and has subsequently become one of the longest-running reality television series in the country. The fifteenth season premiered on August 5, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians/news/a863019/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-season-15-uk-catch-up-episodes-how-to-watch/|title=How to watch Keeping up with the Kardashians in the UK – when does season 15 start?|last=Goodacre|first=Kate|website=Digital Spy|date=2 Aug 2018|accessdate=4 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series focuses mainly on sisters [[Kourtney Kardashian|Kourtney]], [[Kim Kardashian|Kim]], and [[Khloé Kardashian]] and their half-sisters [[Kendall Jenner|Kendall]] and [[Kylie Jenner]]. It also features their parents [[Kris Jenner|Kris]] and [[Caitlyn Jenner]] (previously known as Bruce Jenner), and brother [[Rob Kardashian]]. The significant others of the Kardashian sisters have also appeared on the show, including Kourtney's ex-boyfriend [[Scott Disick]], Kim's ex-husband [[Kris Humphries]], and current husband [[Kanye West]], Khloé's ex-husband [[Lamar Odom]], ex-boyfriend [[French Montana]], and current fiance [[Tristan Thompson]]. Caitlyn's son [[Brody Jenner]] made appearances in the early seasons, before appearing regularly between the 8th and 11th seasons, along with brother [[Brandon &amp; Leah#Brandon Jenner|Brandon]] and Brandon's wife [[Brandon &amp; Leah#Leah Jenner|Leah]]. Kim's friend [[Jonathan Cheban]] and Khloé's friend Malika Haqq have also been part of the show.

''Keeping Up with the Kardashians'' has received very poor critical reviews since its premiere. It is often criticized for the high degree of emphasis on the "[[famous for being famous]]" concept, and for appearing to fabricate some aspects of its storylines. Several critics also noted the show's lack of intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=Will |title=7 TV Shows That May Be Lowering Your IQ |url=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/tv-shows-may-lowering-iq.html/?a=viewall |website=Cheatsheet.com |accessdate=10 June 2018 |date=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some critics recognized the reality series as a "[[guilty pleasure]]" and acknowledged the family's success. Despite the negative reviews, ''Keeping Up with the Kardashians '' has attracted high viewership ratings, becoming one of the network's most successful shows and winning several [[audience award]]s.

The series' success has led additionally to the creation of numerous [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, including: ''[[Kourtney and Kim Take Miami]]'', ''[[Kourtney and Kim Take New York]]'', ''[[Khloé &amp; Lamar]]'', ''[[Kourtney and Khloé Take The Hamptons]]'', ''[[Dash Dolls]]'', ''[[Rob &amp; Chyna]]'', and ''[[Life of Kylie]]''. The network has also broadcast several television specials featuring special events involving members of the family and friends.

== Background ==

[[Robert Kardashian]] (1944{{ndash}}2003) and [[Kris Jenner|Kristen Mary "Kris" Houghton]] (born 1955) married in 1978, and had four children together: daughters [[Kourtney Kardashian|Kourtney]] (born 1979), [[Kim Kardashian|Kim]] (born 1980), and [[Khloé Kardashian|Khloé]] (born 1984), and son [[Rob Kardashian|Rob]] (born 1987). The couple divorced in 1991. In 1994, Robert rose to prominence when he defended [[O. J. Simpson]] for the murders of [[Nicole Brown Simpson]] and [[Ronald Goldman]] during the [[O.J. Simpson trial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.bt.com/lifestyle/who-are-the-kardashians-and-the-jenners-your-guide-to-kylie-kim-caitlyn-and-the-family-11363984898071|title= Why are Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner and the rest of the family famous?|accessdate=January 7, 2017|date=December 22, 2016|first=Carla|last=Challis|publisher=[[BT Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/features/the-kardashian-jenner-family-trees-know-your-reality-tv-royalty-20150716|title=The Kardashian-Jenner Family Trees: Know Your Reality TV Royalty|accessdate=January 7, 2017|date=July 16, 2015|work=[[Rolling Stone]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Kris married retired [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[decathlon]] champion [[Caitlyn Jenner]] (born 1949; formerly known as Bruce Jenner before undergoing a [[gender transition]] in 2015).&lt;ref name="buzz bissinger"&gt;{{cite web |author-link1 = Buzz Bissinger |last1 = Bissinger |first1 = Buzz |title = Caitlyn Jenner: The Full Story|deadurl=no |url = http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/06/caitlyn-jenner-bruce-cover-annie-leibovitz/ |work = [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date = June 1, 2015  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150613015353/http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/06/caitlyn-jenner-bruce-cover-annie-leibovitz |archivedate = June 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kris and Caitlyn had two daughters together, [[Kendall Jenner|Kendall]] (born 1995) and [[Kylie Jenner|Kylie]] (born 1997).

The idea of creating a reality series originated in 2006 when Kris Jenner showed an interest in appearing on a television show together with her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/kris-jenner/#_ |deadurl=no|title = Kris Jenner |first = Dimitri |last = Ehrlich |date = August 28, 2012 |work = [[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120901091634/http://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/kris-jenner |archivedate = September 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenner commented: "Everybody thinks that [my children] could create a bunch of drama in their lives, but it's something that I felt I didn't even have to think about.

He hired a camera man to visit the Kardashian's family home to film them having a Sunday barbeque: "They were all together {{emdash}} as crazy and as fun as loving as they are," Seacrest described the family after seeing the tape. He later initiated the series by sharing the tape with [[E!]], an American cable network which features mostly entertainment-related programming, and [[reality television]] series; the show was eventually picked up.&lt;ref name="creation" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/ryan-seacrest-talks-about-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians |title = Ryan Seacrest reveals how the Kardashian's landed a reality show |first = Alice |last = Howarth |accessdate = August 23, 2015 |date = January 20, 2015 |work = [[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2007, it was announced that the Kardashian and Jenner families would star in a yet-to-be-titled reality show on E! described as a "new non-scripted family [[sitcom]]", being produced by [[Ryan Seacrest Productions|Ryan Seacrest]] and [[Bunim/Murray Productions]].

The show, entitled ''Keeping Up With the Kardashians'', premiered on October 14, 2007.&lt;ref name="2nd" /&gt; The reality series centers around the members of the Kardashian-Jenner blended family, focusing on the sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khloé.

=== Cast ===

The reality series revolves around the children of Kris Jenner, and originally focused mainly on the children from her first marriage to deceased attorney Robert Kardashian: Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Rob. Kris' children Kendall and Kylie from her subsequent marriage to American athlete Caitlyn (formerly Bruce) Jenner have also been featured on the show since its beginning,&lt;ref name="revisiting1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.vulture.com/2014/09/revisiting-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians.html |title = Revisiting Season 1 of 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians': Part 1 |work = [[New York (magazine)|Vulture]] |first = Kevin |last = Fanning |date = September 18, 2014 |accessdate = August 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.vulture.com/2014/09/revisiting-season-1-of-the-kardashians-part-2.html |title = Revisiting Season 1 of 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians', Part 2 |work = Vulture |first = Kevin |last = Fanning |date = September 24, 2014 |accessdate = August 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with Jenner's son [[Brody Jenner|Brody]] from another marriage, although he appeared very few times during the early seasons, mostly being called by his step-brother Rob to babysit their half-sisters Kylie and Kendall.&lt;ref name="brody" /&gt; Kourtney's boyfriend [[Scott Disick]] has also been appearing frequently on the show since the first season, as well as on the show's spin-offs.&lt;ref name="revisiting1" /&gt; Cast members also include numerous friends and other acquaintances of the family members, most notably Malika Haqq and [[Jonathan Cheban]] who joined ''Keeping Up with the Kardashians'' in the second and third seasons, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wetpaint.com/who-is-malika-haqq-background-info-on-khloe-kardashians-bff-698554/ |title = Who Is Malika Haqq?

Most of the Kardashian sisters' significant others have appeared on the reality series.

Khloé married basketball player [[Lamar Odom]] during a fourth-season premiere aired in 2009.

===Spin-offs===
The success of the reality series resulted in the development of several [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] shows and other related programming. In April 2009, E! announced the first spin-off of ''Keeping Up with the Kardashians'' entitled ''Kourtney and Khloé in Miami'', which was later renamed ''[[Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami]]''. The series followed the sisters who moved to Miami to open a new [[Dash (boutique)|Dash]] boutique. [[Ted Harbert]], president and CEO of Comcast Entertainment Group, considered the sisters capable of handling their own standalone series. "It's a very simple formula that we took from scripted TV and applied to a reality show.

''Keeping Up with the Kardashians'' has been the subject of constant panning by critics since its inception. Brian Lowry, reviewing the show for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', said that the network: "widens its lens to encompass the whole irritating brood — including Kim's sisters Khloé and Kourtney, mom-manager Kris and stepdad Bruce Jenner, who now has the distinction of having two sets of useless rich kids featured in pointless reality shows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://variety.com/2007/scene/markets-festivals/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-1117935063/ |title = Review: 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' |work = Variety |first = Brian |last = Lowry |accessdate = January 3, 2016 |date = October 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ginia Bellafonte of ''[[The New York Times]]'' compared the show to reality series ''[[Gene Simmons Family Jewels]]'' and exclaimed that: "the Kardashian show is not about an eccentric family living conventionally; it is purely about some desperate women climbing to the margins of fame, and that feels a lot creepier."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Bellafonte |first1 = Ginia |title = Keeping Up With the Kardashians The All-Too-Easy Route to Stardom |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/13/arts/television/13bell.html?_r=0 |work = The New York Times |accessdate = April 22, 2015 |date = October 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Burrows of [[IGN]] criticized the family for being too self-seeking and using the given platform only to gain more notoriety for themselves.

"Since Kim doesn't exactly seem to be an exemplar of self-awareness, I suppose it's possible that she really believed she and Humphries would live happily ever after," Kelly speculated whether or not the marriage was a [[publicity stunt]]. "But more likely, she and E! are laughing all the way to the bank {{ndash}} 10.5 million viewers tuned into "Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event", after all," Kelly summarized the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/23/how-about-not-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians |title = How about not keeping up with the Kardashians? |date = November 23, 2011 |first = Maura |deadurl=no|last = Kelly |work = [[The Guardian]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305002226/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/23/how-about-not-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians |archivedate = March 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Josh Duboff, writing for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', commented on the show's long run and said that "it is near impossible to argue that their continued relevance, 10 years later, is anything other than awe-inspiring and remarkable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/04/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-season-12-premiere-review |title = 12 Seasons Later, ''Keeping Up with the Kardashians'' Is Perhaps More Important to the Kardashian Machine than Ever |date = May 1, 2016 |accessdate = May 6, 2016 |first = Josh |last = Duboff |work = Vanity Fair }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lindy Chen''', founder of China Direct Sourcing Services, author of the book named ''Import from China-how to make a million and not get burnt!'', is an authority in simplifying the process of doing business in China.

==Life and career==
Born in China, Lindy Chen grew up in a normal family in [[Guiyang]], China. When Lindy was young, she had two [[goal|objectives]]: setting up her own business, and doing business related to China. After she graduated from [[Tianjin University]], she worked for two companies in China and made notable contributions. These work experience played an important role when Lindy set up her own business in Australia in 2005.

Lindy Chen went to Australia as an international student in 2002. She found it very difficult to survive in this new environment because of diversity of culture and language. She sold [[Ticket (admission)|movie tickets]] door-to-door, having a considerably low income. At the same time, Lindy put great effort on improving her English and learning local customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kehren|first1=Kerstin|title=Lindy Chen's shoes were made for walking, and making lots of money|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/lindy-chens-shoes-were-made-for-walking-and-making-lots-of-money-20130923-2u9ia.html?eid=cpc:nnn-15omn0932-optim-nnn:google_adwords-11/02/2015-bau_paid_search_campaign-dom-textad-nnn-bt-nnn&amp;campaign_code=15caf035&amp;promote_channel=sem&amp;gclid=CMOBwcD0zMUCFYcGvAod1DcAgQ|work=Brisbane Times|date=23 September 2013|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, she found an [[:wikt:opportunity|opportunity]] to start her own business, Chinadirect sourcing. As an entrepreneur, she helped a range of Australian local companies building their careers through importing from China. Up to 2011, she helped her clients saved over 5 million dollars in terms of manufacturing and importing costs. According to the local television show, ''How to Get That Job'',she talked about her ambition: leading her team and becoming one of the best sourcing company around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russo|first1=Sarina|title=How to Get that Job Lindy Chen|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSuX1ClPk9Q|via=YouTube|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the subsequent decades his business interests were dominated by food manufacturing. Although best known for biscuits, he also manufactured Weetabix and Buitoni pasta, sweets and, in the early days, bread. Although Kenya was always his base, he also developed businesses in Tanzania, Pakistan and the UK.

'''Martin Chilcott''' (born 12 December 1965) is a British entrepreneur specializing in environment and education, best known as the founder and CEO of [[2degrees Network|2degrees]], the world’s largest community for [[sustainable business]].

His first successful business venture was CTSS, a specialist technology marketing company, with colleague and friend [[James Tarin]]. In 1995, he established Clarity Communications, followed by various companies that included Meltwater Ventures, a green business incubation service.

==Early life==

Chilcott was born in [[Aldershot]], [[Hampshire]], the son of Rosemary and Lt-Col Michael John-Patrick Chilcott. Chilcott was educated at [[St Joseph's College, Ipswich|St Josephs College, Ipswich]] before going on to study History at [[Clare College, Cambridge]].

==Career==

In 1989, Chilcott started CTSS, a specialist technology marketing consultancy, with his current business partner, James Tarin. Their main client for 5 years was a small start-up business called The [[Carphone Warehouse]], which would grow into Europe’s largest independent mobile phone retailer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carphonewarehouse.com/store-locator&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of its success, Chilcott’s business moved to London and in 1995 founded Clarity IBD Ltd, an [[Electronic business|e-business]] consultancy that would work with [[Abbey National]] and [[National Rail]] to create online content. This was later acquired by [[Proxicom]], another [[Electronic business|e-business]] consultancy.&lt;ref&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2000_April_20/ai_61592992/&lt;/ref&gt; After various further business ventures Chilcott co-founded Place Group, an educational consultancy company, in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.place-group.com/&lt;/ref&gt; He would spend the next few years working alongside local authorities and national government programs until, by 2008, they were the market leader in delivering school-academy transitions in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.place-group.com/news062.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328022013/http://www.place-group.com/news062.html |archivedate=2012-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after the founding of Place Group, Chilcott started a business incubator called Meltwater Ventures that specialized in environmental programs and resource scarcity. Meltwater Ventures would eventually generate the idea for 2degrees.

==2degrees==

By 2006, Chilcott had been drawn to sustainability and carbon reduction, having seen the opportunity build on a valuable business niche there. He, along with James Tarin, recognized that many business were attempting to solve similar sustainability problems independent of each other, but that and that there was no online community which could be used to connect them and collectively solve problems. This thinking led to the founding of the [[2degrees Network|2degrees Community]] in 2008 and, by 2011, it was the world largest Community for Sustainable Business and had offices in the UK and US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justmeans.com/press-releases/The-Worlds-largest-sustainability-network-defines-key-competencies-to-thrive-through-the-4th-economic-revolution/7402.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714002553/http://www.justmeans.com/press-releases/The-Worlds-largest-sustainability-network-defines-key-competencies-to-thrive-through-the-4th-economic-revolution/7402.html |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Martin Chilcott currently lives in [[Oxford]] and currently spends his time between his family, his business, and maintaining his Dutch barge.

He is also a trustee of [[Oxford business x]], a youth enterprise scheme based at the [[Said Business School]] in Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charitiesdirect.com/charities/oxford-business-x-1139847.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927180813/http://www.charitiesdirect.com/charities/oxford-business-x-1139847.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, he sat on the panel of judges for [[The Guardian]]'s Sustainable Business Awards 2011.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/judges-martin-chilcott&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin is the fourth child of five. He has 11 nephews and nieces as well as one great niece (Ottilie Sowerby) - His favourite nephews are Berty and Harry Chilcott.

'''Orion Pictures Corporation''' is an American [[List of film production companies|motion picture producer]] and [[Film distributor|distributor]] that produced and released films from 1978 until 1999 and was also involved in television production and syndication throughout the 1980s until the early 1990s. It was formed in 1978 as a [[joint venture]] between [[Warner Bros.]] and three former top-level executives of [[United Artists]]. Although it was never a large motion picture producer, Orion achieved a comparatively high reputation for [[Hollywood]] quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Whither Orion? : The Last of the Mini-Major Studios Finds Itself at a Crossroads|publisher= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1990-07-19|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-19/entertainment/ca-363_1_studio-executives|accessdate=2010-12-28|first=Nina J.|last=Easton}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Woody Allen]], [[James Cameron]], [[Jonathan Demme]], [[Oliver Stone]], and several other prominent directors worked with Orion during its most successful years from 1978 to 1992. Of the films distributed by Orion, four won [[Academy Award]]s for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]: ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'' (1984), ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990), and ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991).&lt;ref name="variety" /&gt;  Two other Orion films, ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' (1986) and ''[[Mississippi Burning]]'' (1988), were nominated for that same category.

In 2013, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] revived the Orion name for television; a year later, Orion Pictures was relaunched by the studio.

==History==

===Beginnings: 1978–1981===
In January 1978, three executives of [[Transamerica Corporation|Transamerica]] (TA)-owned studio [[United Artists]] (UA) – [[Arthur B. Krim]] (chairman), [[Eric Pleskow]] (president and chief executive officer), and [[Robert S. Benjamin]] (chairman of the finance committee) - quit their jobs. Krim and Benjamin had headed UA since 1951, and subsequently turned around the then-flailing studio with a number of critical and commercial successes. Change had begun once Transamerica purchased UA in 1967, and within a decade a rift formed between Krim and TA chairman Jack Beckett regarding the studio's operations. Krim suggested spinning off United Artists into a separate company, which was rejected by Beckett.&lt;ref name="may"&gt;Medavoy and Young, pp. 83-90&lt;/ref&gt;

The last straw came for Pleskow when he refused to collect and deliver the medical records of UA department heads to Transamerica's offices in San Francisco for the sake of confidentiality. The tensions only worsened when ''Fortune'' magazine reported an article on the clash between UA and TA, in which Beckett had stated that if the executives disliked the parent company's treatment of them, they should resign.&lt;ref name="may" /&gt; Krim, Benjamin, and Pleskow quit United Artists on January 13, 1978, followed by the exits of senior vice presidents William Bernstein and [[Mike Medavoy]] three days later. The week following the resignations, according to the website ''Reference for Business'', "63 important Hollywood figures took out an advertisement in a trade paper warning UA that it had made a fatal mistake in letting the five men leave. The 'fatal mistake' came true following the box office disaster of ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]''"&lt;ref name="RFB"&gt;[http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/48/ORION-PICTURES-CORPORATION.html "Orion Pictures Corporation."] ''Reference for Business''&lt;/ref&gt; which led to Transamerica selling UA to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Champlin |first1=Charles |title=That's a Wrap: End of MGM/UA That Was |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-20/entertainment/ca-5110_1_mgm-lot |accessdate=2013-08-16 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=November 20, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1978, the five men forged a deal with [[Warner Bros.]] The executives formed Orion Pictures Company, named after [[Orion (constellation)|the constellation]], which they claimed had five main stars (it actually has seven/eight). The new company intended only to finance projects, giving the filmmakers complete creative autonomy; this ideal was implemented with great success at United Artists.  Orion held a $100 million line of credit, and its films would be distributed by the [[Warner Bros.]] studio. Orion, however, was contractually given free rein over distribution and advertising, as well as the number and type of films the executives chose to invest in.&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, pp. 95-97&lt;/ref&gt;

In late March 1978, Orion signed its first contract; a two-picture deal with [[John Travolta]]'s production company. Contracts with actress and director [[Barbra Streisand]]; actors [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]], [[Jane Fonda]], [[Peter Sellers]], [[Jon Voight]], and [[Burt Reynolds]]; directors [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[Blake Edwards]]; writer/director [[John Milius]]; singer [[Peter Frampton]]; and producer [[Ray Stark]] soon materialized.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HbssAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LxMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4846,4749317&amp;dq=orion+pictures&amp;hl=en "Top Stars Join Orion Pictures"] ''Wilmington Morning Star'' (November 22, 1978; page 10-A). Retrieved November 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Orion also developed a co-financing and distribution deal with [[EMI Films]].&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; In its first year, Orion had 15 films into productions plus were in production, and had a dozen more actors, directors and producers line up to sign up with Orion.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt;

In 1979, Benjamin died. Orion's first film, ''[[A Little Romance]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; was released in April that year. That year, Orion released [[Blake Edwards]]' ''[[10 (film)|10]]'', which became a big critical and commercial success; the first for Edwards in over a decade (aside from installments of ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|The Pink Panther]]'' franchise). Other films released in that period included ''[[Caddyshack]]''; ''[[The Great Santini]]'', a critically praised but underpromoted adaptation of a [[Pat Conroy]] novel; and ''[[Promises in the Dark (film)|Promises in the Dark]]''. Out of the 23 films Orion released between April 1979 and December 1981, only a third of them made a profit.&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Orion executives were conflicted over financing big-budgeted films and passed on ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' for that reason.&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, p. 114-115&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition of Filmways: 1981–1983===
By early 1982, Orion had severed its distribution ties with Warner. As part of the deal, the rights to Orion's films made up to that point were sold to Warner. Orion was now looking to have its own distribution network by acquiring another company with such capabilities. The four partners looked into [[Monogram Pictures|Allied Artists]] and [[Embassy Pictures]]&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; before settling on [[Filmways]].&lt;ref name=aic&gt;{{cite book|last=Tzioumakis|first=Yannis|title=AMERICAN INDEPENDENT CINEMA|year=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|pages=228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orion subsequently purchased Filmways and reorganized the flailing company. New employees were hired and all of Filmways' non-entertainment assets ([[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] and [[Broadcast Electronics]]) were sold off.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=aic/&gt; On August 31, 1982, Filmways was renamed as Orion Pictures Corporation.

Another result of the merger was that Orion entered television production. Orion's biggest TV hit was ''[[Cagney &amp; Lacey]]'', which lasted seven seasons on CBS. In 1983, Orion Pictures introduced art-house division [[Orion Classics]] with executives who had previously run [[United Artists|United Artists Classics]].&lt;ref name=aic/&gt;

===Problems arise: 1984–1986===
According to ''Reference for Business'': "Of the first 18 movies the company had released as Orion Pictures Corporation, ten had been profitable, five had broken even, and three had losses of less than $2 million."&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; One such film, [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[The Cotton Club (film)|The Cotton Club]]'', was mired in legal troubles and Orion lost $3 million of its investment.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; '"We've had some singles and doubles [but haven't] had any home runs," lamented Krim.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; In September 1984, Orion distributed ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'', which garnered many accolades, winning eight [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt;

For Orion, 1985 was a dismal year. All but two films, ''[[Desperately Seeking Susan]]'' and ''[[Code of Silence (film)|Code of Silence]]'', made less than $10 million in the United States box office, including an unsuccessful attempt at a [[James Bond]]-type franchise, ''[[Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins]]''.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; Orion's haphazard distribution channels and unsuccessful advertising campaigns made it impossible to achieve a hit. Another factor was that Orion was about to venture into the video business and stopped selling off home use rights to its films. Furthermore, production of the [[Rodney Dangerfield]] comedy ''[[Back to School]]'' was put on hold when a co-producer died, taking the film off of its Christmas 1985 release slate.&lt;ref name="nyc"&gt;Kornbluth, Jesse (April 6, 1987). ''The Little Studio that Could'' (pp. 48-54). ''[[New York Magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1986, [[Mario Kassar]] and [[Andrew Vajna]], producers of the ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'' films (the first film, ''[[First Blood (film)|First Blood]]'', was distributed by Orion) attempted to buy $55 million worth of the studio's stock through the duo's company, [[Carolco Pictures|Anabasis]]. Had they succeeded, Kassar and Vajna would have controlled the board and laid off every executive save for Krim.&lt;ref name="nyc" /&gt; Warburg Pincus subsequently limited its 20% stake in Orion to 5%; the remaining stocks were acquired by [[Viacom (original)|Viacom International]].&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; Viacom hoped to use Orion's product for its pay-TV channel [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]].&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Orion expanded into home video distribution with the formation of Orion Home Entertainment Corporation.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt;

===Metromedia era: 1986–1991===
On May 22, 1986, [[Metromedia]], a television and communications company controlled by billionaire (and a friend of Krim's) [[John Kluge]], which had just divested of its television station group to [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation]] (which would form what is now the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]]), purchased a 6.5% stake in Orion. Kluge's investment in the company came at the right time- ''Back to School'' was a success and ultimately earned $90 million at the box office.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; By March 1987, the studio's fortunes increased dramatically with a succession of critical and commercial hits, including ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (which ultimately won a Best Picture Oscar), Woody Allen's ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', and the sports film ''[[Hoosiers (film)|Hoosiers]]''. Orion's 1986 offerings totaled 18 Academy Award nominations, more than any other studio.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; In 1987, Orion achieved further success with ''[[RoboCop]]'', and ''[[No Way Out (1987 film)|No Way Out]]''.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; By this time, Orion's television division had expanded into the lucrative syndicated game show market under the name ''Century Towers Productions'', in reference to Orion's street address at the time. It produced revivals of format inherited from [[Heatter-Quigley Productions]] after the Filmways merger (as Filmways had previously acquired HQ in the late 1960s); this included ''[[Hollywood Squares|The New Hollywood Squares]]'', which ran from 1986 to 1989, and a revival of ''[[High Rollers]]'' which aired in the 1987-88 season.

In January 1987, Kluge faced big competition with the arrival of [[Sumner Redstone]]. His theater chain, [[National Amusements]], purchased 6.42 percent of the company's stock. National Amusements later acquired Viacom, increasing their Orion stake at 21%, then 26%. Soon Kluge started buying more Orion stock, leading to him and Redstone battling it out to take over the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= COMPANY NEWS; Orion Pictures Stake Increased|work= The New York Times|date=1987-12-17|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/17/business/company-news-orion-pictures-stake-increased.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Orion%20Pictures&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= A 6.5% Stake In Orion Pictures|work= The New York Times|date=1986-06-03|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/03/business/a-6.5-stake-in-orion-pictures.html?scp=7&amp;sq=Orion%20Pictures&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kluge ultimately succeeded when Metromedia took over approximately 67% of Orion on May 20, 1988, effectively giving him control of the studio.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; One analyst commented on the takeover to the ''Wall Street Journal'': "This amount is probably so small to Kluge it doesn't matter. He probably burns that up in a weekend."&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt;

In 1989, Orion suffered from a disastrous slate of films, placing themselves dead last among the major Hollywood studios in terms of box office revenue. Among its biggest flops that year were ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire!]]'', the biography of [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] starring [[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Winona Ryder]]; ''[[She-Devil (film)|She-Devil]]'', a dark comedy starring [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Roseanne Barr]]; and [[Miloš Forman]]'s adaptation of ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]]'', ''[[Valmont (film)|Valmont]]'', which competed with ''[[Dangerous Liaisons]]'', also based on the same source material. Test screenings of the [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] comedy ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' were so strong that Orion had high expectations for it. It flopped at first,&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; but it has since attained a strong cult following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes

In February 1990, Orion signed a deal with [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia Pictures Entertainment]] in which the much larger studio would pay Orion $175 million to distribute Orion's movies and television programs overseas. Orion had previously licensed its films to individual distributors territory by territory.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; That same month, Mike Medavoy left Orion and became head of [[Tri-Star Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

1990 was just as dismal for Orion as the year prior, with such failures as ''[[The Hot Spot]]'' and ''[[State of Grace (1990 film)|State of Grace]]''. The only bright spot that year was [[Kevin Costner]]'s western epic ''[[Dances with Wolves]]''. It won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture,&lt;ref name="wb"&gt;{{cite news|title= BUSINESS PEOPLE; Chief at Orion Pictures Is Joining Paramount|work= The New York Times|date=1992-02-21|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/21/business/business-people-chief-at-orion-pictures-is-joining-paramount.html?scp=4&amp;sq=Orion%20Pictures&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08 | first=Anthony | last=Ramirez}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grossed $400 million worldwide. A few months later, Orion garnered another winner with ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', but these two films could not make up for years of losses. Only Kluge's continued infusions of cash were enough to keep the company afloat, but soon he had enough.

===Bankruptcy: 1991–1995===
After failing to sell Orion to businessman (and former 20th Century Fox owner) [[Marvin Davis]] ([[Sony]], which had recently purchased [[Columbia Pictures]] was also interested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= COMPANY NEWS; Orion Pictures' Stock Increases|work= The New York Times|date=1991-02-09|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/09/business/company-news-orion-pictures-stock-increases.html?scp=5&amp;sq=Orion%20Pictures&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Kluge took drastic steps. First, Orion shut down production. Second, Kluge ordered the sale of several projects, such as ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'' (which went to [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], though the international rights to the film were retained by Orion), in order to accumulate much-needed cash. Finally, in the spring of 1991, Kluge's people took over the company, leading to the departure of Arthur Krim.&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, pp. 202-203.&lt;/ref&gt; Orion's financial problems were so severe, that at the 63rd Annual Academy Awards in March 1991, host [[Billy Crystal]] made reference to the studio's debt in his opening monologue, joking that "''[[Reversal of Fortune]]'' [is] about a woman in a coma, ''[[Awakenings (film)|Awakenings]]'' [is] about a man in a coma; and ''Dances with Wolves'' [was] released by Orion, a studio in a coma."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0lWrZL0EHE Billy Crystal Oscars Opening -- 1991 Academy Awards.] [[The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]-YouTube Channel. Retrieved on June 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this time that [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] stepped in to co-finance and assume production over many of Orion TV's shows it had in production, such as ''[[American Detective]]'' and ''[[Equal Justice (TV series)|Equal Justice]]''.

On November 25, 1991, Orion sold its ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' format rights to [[King World Productions]] after Orion closed down its television division.&lt;ref name="broadcasting19911125"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1991-11-25|title=King Gets the Square |journal=Broadcasting|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 11, 1991, Orion filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] protection.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt;

In December 1991, Orion was in talks with [[New Line Cinema]], a successful independent film company, to acquire the bankrupt studio. By the following April, Orion and New Line Cinema cancelled their plans on the issue of price. [[Republic Pictures]] and the then-new [[Savoy Pictures]] also attempted to buy Orion, but no deal materialized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= THE MEDIA BUSINESS; New Line Breaks Off Talks On Buying Orion Pictures|work= The New York Times|date=1992-04-22|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/22/business/the-media-business-new-line-breaks-off-talks-on-buying-orion-pictures.html?scp=6&amp;sq=Orion%20Pictures&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08 | first=Richard W. | last=Stevenson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= COMPANY NEWS; 2d Company Makes Bid for Orion Pictures|work= The New York Times|date=1992-04-10|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/10/business/company-news-2d-company-makes-bid-for-orion-pictures.html?scp=2&amp;sq=Orion%20Pictures&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Academy Awards ceremony, broadcast on March 30, 1992, Crystal yet made another reference to Orion, this time about its demise: {{cquote|Take a great studio like Orion: a few years ago Orion released ''Platoon'', it wins Best Picture. ''Amadeus'', Best Picture. Last year, they released ''Dances with Wolves'' wins Best Picture. This year ''The Silence of the Lambs'' is nominated for Best Picture. And they can't afford to have another hit! But there is good news and bad news. The good news is that Orion was just purchased, and the bad news is it was bought by the House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCAi1744Sa0 Billy Crystal Oscars Opening -- 1992 Academy Awards.] [[The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]-YouTube Channel. Retrieved on June 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''The Silence of the Lambs'' swept all five major Academy Awards; however, a majority of key executives, as well as the talent they had deals with, had left the studio. Hollywood observers had doubts that Orion would be resurrected to its former glory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Orion Pictures' Losses Widen|work= The New York Times|date=1992-04-08|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/08/business/orion-pictures-losses-widen.html?scp=8&amp;sq=Orion%20Pictures&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 5, 1992, Orion reemerged from bankruptcy. Its reorganization plan would allow for Orion to continue producing and releasing films, but financing for the features would be provided by outside sources, with the studio purchasing the distribution rights to them after their completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/1992/biz/news/orion-emerges-from-chapter-11-100780/|title=Orion emerges from Chapter 11|last=Brennan|first=Paul Noglows, Judy|date=1992-11-06|work=Variety|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?FilingID=343274-5759-53456&amp;type=sect&amp;tabindex=2|title=EDGAR Pro|website=yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orion's bankruptcy also delayed the release of many films the studio had produced or acquired, among them: ''[[Love Field (film)|Love Field]]'' (1992), ''[[RoboCop 3]]'' (1993), ''[[The Dark Half (film)|The Dark Half]]'' (1993), ''[[Blue Sky (film)|Blue Sky]]'' (1994), ''[[Car 54, Where Are You? (film)|Car 54, Where Are You?]]'' (1994), ''[[Clifford (film)|Clifford]]'' (1994), ''[[The Favor]]'' (1994), and ''[[There Goes My Baby (film)|There Goes My Baby]]'' (1994). Orion started releasing these films after their reorganization. ''Blue Sky'' won star [[Jessica Lange]] an Academy Award for Best Actress in 1995.

===Metromedia International Group===
In November 1995, Orion and three other companies controlled by Kluge were merged to form the Metromedia International Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/02/business/the-media-business-actava-group-seals-stock-swap.html|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS;Actava Group Seals Stock Swap|last=Bloomberg Business News|first=|date=1995-11-02|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-01|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few of the films released during the four years after [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|bankruptcy protection]] were successful either critically or commercially.

In 1996, Metromedia acquired production company [[Motion Picture Corporation of America]], and installed its heads, Brad Krevoy and Steve Stabler, as co-presidents of Orion. Both received a six picture put picture distribution deal as a part of their contracts.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horn|first1=John|title=Coming soon, to very few theaters|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/21/entertainment/et-mgm21|accessdate=June 10, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=February 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years ahead, Orion produced very few films, and primarily released films from other producers, including [[Artisan Entertainment|LIVE Entertainment]]. [[Orion Classics]], minus its founders (who had moved to [[Sony Pictures|Sony Pictures Entertainment]] and founded [[Sony Pictures Classics]]), continued to acquire popular [[art-house]] films, such as ''[[Boxing Helena]]'' (1993), before Metromedia merged the subsidiary with [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company|Samuel Goldwyn Entertainment]] in 1996.

===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer subsidiary===
In July 1997, Metromedia shareholders approved the sale of Orion (as well as Samuel Goldwyn Entertainment and [[Motion Picture Corporation of America]]) to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. This led to the withdrawal of 85 employees, including Krevoy and Stabler, while 111 other employees were to be laid off within nine months, leaving 25 of them to work at MGM. Orion also brought with it, a two thousand film library, ten completed movies and five direct-to-video features for future release&lt;ref name=vty1&gt;{{cite news | last = Weiner | first = Rex | date = July 11, 1997 | title = MGM ends Orion orbit | url = https://variety.com/1997/film/news/mgm-ends-orion-orbit-1116676950/ | newspaper= Variety | location     =  | access-date  = Jun 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Krevoy and Stabler movie put picture distribution deal.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; Krevoy and Stabler retained the right to the Motion Picture Corporation of America name and their three top movies. Metromedia retained Goldwyn Entertainment's Landmark Theatre Group.&lt;ref name=vty1/&gt;  ''[[One Man's Hero]]'' (1999) was the last film released by Orion for 15 years.

MGM kept Orion intact as a corporation thus to avoid its Warner Bros. video distribution agreement and began distributing Orion Pictures films under the Orion Home Video label. MGM acquired the 2/3 of pre-1996 [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]] library from [[Seagram]] in 1999 for $250&amp;nbsp;million, increasing their library holdings to 4,000. The PolyGram libraries were purchased by its Orion Pictures subsidiary so as to avoid its 1990 video distribution agreement with Warner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eller|first=Claudia |title=MGM Agrees to Acquire PolyGram Movie Library|date=23 October 1998|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/23/business/fi-35357 |accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1999, MGM bought out its distribution contract with Warner Bros. for $225 million, effectively ending the distribution problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/MGM+REGAINS+VIDEO+RIGHTS%253B+$225+MILLION+DEAL+TO+HELP+SELL+DVDS.-a083605917|title=MGM REGAINS VIDEO RIGHTS; $225 MILLION DEAL TO HELP SELL DVDS. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, MGM revived the Orion Television brand (after Orion's original TV unit was shut down during its bankruptcy era in the early 1990s) as Orion TV Productions with a new syndicated series, ''[[Lauren Lake's Paternity Court|Paternity Court]]''.&lt;ref name=vty0&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saval|first1=Malina|title=MGM TV Rides High With ‘Vikings’ and ‘Fargo’|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/festivals/mgm-tv-rides-high-with-vikings-and-fargo-1201152961/|accessdate=October 28, 2015|work=Variety|issue=April 1, 2014|publisher=Penske Business Media, LLC|date=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orion Pictures name, also as Orion Releasing, was extended in fourth quarter 2014 for smaller multi-platform video on demand and limited theatrical distribution. Its name was first seen again on September 10, 2014 in front of the trailer for ''[[The Town That Dreaded Sundown (2014 film)|The Town That Dreaded Sundown]]'' that was released in October. The label's first release was the Brazilian film ''Vestido pra Casar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Torrelio|first1=Sebastian|title=Orion Pictures Label Returns for First Time in 15 Years|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/orion-pictures-label-returns-for-first-time-in-15-years-1201304184/|accessdate=March 10, 2017|work=Variety|date=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, [[Entertainment One Films]] relaunched the [[Momentum Pictures]] banner with an announced deal with Orion Pictures to co-acquire and co-distribute films in the United States and Canada, and selected foreign markets, such as the [[United Kingdom]] (Momentum's country of origin). The initial films under the deal were ''[[The Wannabe]]'', ''[[Fort Tilden (film)|Fort Tilden]]'' and ''[[Balls Out (2014 film)|Balls Out]]''.&lt;ref name=hwr&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tiff-eone-relaunches-momentum-pictures-821351|title=TIFF: eOne Relaunches Momentum Pictures Label With Orion Releasing Deal|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other films released by Orion Pictures and [[Momentum Pictures]] include ''[[Pocket Listing (film)|Pocket Listing]]'' and ''[[Diablo (2015 film)|Diablo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Kay | first=Jeremy | url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/production/shoot-wraps-on-pocket-listing/5065176.article | title=Shoot wraps on Pocket Listing | website=ScreenDaily | date=January 8, 2014 | accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Busch | first=Anita | title=Orion Pictures Picks up ‘Pocket Listing’ For Limited Theatrical Release | url=http://deadline.com/2016/11/pocket-listing-theatrical-release-2016-rob-lowe-burt-reynolds-1201848696/ | website=Deadline | date=November 4, 2016 | accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hollywood Reporter"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vlessing|first1=Ethan|title=Scott Eastwood's 'Diablo' Nabbed by Orion Releasing, Momentum|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/scott-eastwoods-diablo-nabbed-by-840589|accessdate=18 March 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in September 2016 with ''[[Burn Country]]'', Orion Pictures and [[Samuel Goldwyn Films]] paired in acquiring several films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hipes |first=Patrick |url=http://deadline.com/2016/09/burn-country-dominic-rains-release-date-samuel-goldwyn-orion-pictures-1201816023/ |title=Ian Olds’ ‘Burn Country’ Acquired By Samuel Goldwyn &amp; Orion |publisher=Deadline |date=2016-09-09 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hipes |first=Patrick |url=http://deadline.com/2016/12/past-life-israel-movie-orion-samuel-goldwyn-1201871935/ |title=Israeli Thriller ‘Past Life’ Lands At Orion &amp; Samuel Goldwyn |website=Deadline |date=2016-12-15 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hipes |first=Patrick |url=http://deadline.com/2016/12/youth-in-oregon-release-date-frank-langella-orion-samuel-goldwyn-1201873616/ |title=‘Youth In Oregon’: Release Date Set For Frank Langella Movie After Deal |website=Deadline |date=2016-12-19 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Amanda N&amp;#039;Duka |url=http://deadline.com/2017/03/the-orchard-super-dark-times-orion-pictures-samuel-goldwyn-films-tracktown-1202038668/ |title=The Orchard Lands ’Super Dark Times’; Orion, Samuel Goldwyn Nab ‘Tracktown’ |website=Deadline |date=2017-03-07 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Orion TV added another court series, ''Couples Court'', to its syndicated line up. The show is presided over by a husband wife team and deals with marital issues primarily cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Desk|first1=TV News|title=Orion Television's COUPLES COURT Coming to National Syndication This Fall|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/Orion-Televisions-COUPLES-COURT-Coming-to-National-Syndication-This-Fall-20170113#|accessdate=March 10, 2017|website=Broadway World|publisher=Wisdom Digital Media|date=January 13, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 2017, MGM officially revitalized the Orion Pictures brand as a standalone, US theatrical marketing and distribution arm with the hiring of John Hegeman, who had come from [[Blumhouse Productions|Blumhouse Tilt]] (distributor of Orion's ''[[The Town That Dreaded Sundown (2014 film)|The Town That Dreaded Sundown]]'' and ''[[The Belko Experiment]]'') and incidentally got his start working at the old Orion in the 1980s. Hegeman will serve as president of the expanded label and report to [[Jonathan Glickman]], president of MGM's motion picture group. Under his leadership, the "new" Orion will produce, market and distribute four to six modestly budgeted films a year across genres and platforms, both wide and limited releases for targeted audiences, and its first release, the young adult romance drama ''[[Every Day (2018 film)|Every Day]]'', was released in February 23, 2018.&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dave McNary |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/mgm-re-launching-orion-pictures-distributor-1202548889/ |title=MGM Relaunching Orion Pictures as Distributor |work=Variety |date=2017-09-06 |accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mgm-relaunches-orion-pictures-under-john-hegeman-1035761 |title=MGM Relaunches Orion Pictures Under John Hegeman |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date= |accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deadline"&gt;{{cite web|last=Busch |first=Anita |url=http://deadline.com/2017/09/orion-pictures-relaunched-mgm-john-hegeman-president-1202162614/ |title=Orion Label Relaunched By MGM As Stand-Alone; John Hegeman President |website=Deadline |date=2017-09-06 |accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nick Romano |url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/12/06/angourie-rice-every-day-first-look-photos/ |title=Angourie Rice stars in Every Day movie first-look photos |website=EW.com |date=2017-12-06 |accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orion's library today===
Almost all of Orion's post-1982 releases, as well as most of the AIP and Filmways backlogs and all of the television output originally produced and distributed by Orion Television, now bear the MGM name. However, in most cases, the 1980s Orion logo has been retained or added, in the case of the Filmways and AIP libraries.

Most ancillary rights to Orion's back catalog from the 1978–1982 joint venture period remain with Warner Bros., including such movies as ''[[10 (film)|10]]'' (1979), ''[[Caddyshack]]'' (1980), ''[[Arthur (1981 film)|Arthur]]'' (1981), ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' (1981), and ''[[Prince of the City (film)|Prince of the City]]'' (1981). Some post-1982 films originally released by Orion &amp;mdash; ''[[Lionheart (1987 film)|Lionheart]]'' (1987), ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being (film)|The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]'' (1988), and ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'' (1984) (the latter two being [[Saul Zaentz]] productions) &amp;mdash; are currently distributed by Warner Bros. as well. [[HBO]] also owns video distribution rights to ''[[Three Amigos]]'' (1986), which co-produced the film and owns pay-TV rights. However, MGM owns all other rights and the film's copyright.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} ''[[The Wanderers (1979 film)|The Wanderers]]'' is owned by the film's producers; however, the copyright is held by MGM/Orion.

Woody Allen's films ''[[A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy]]'' (1982) and ''[[Zelig]]'' (1983) are the only Orion films from the original joint venture period now owned by MGM. Orion releases produced by the [[Hemdale Film Corporation]] and [[Barry Spikings|Nelson Entertainment]] are included in MGM's library as well, and are incorporated into the Orion library. MGM via [[PolyGram|Polygram Entertainment]] did not acquire the Hemdale films, (which include ''The Terminator'', ''Hoosiers'',  and ''Platoon'') or the Nelson films (including the ''Bill &amp; Ted'' films), until MGM via Polygram Entertainment bought the pre-1996 library of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, which included both companies' libraries, although the television and digital rights to certain Nelson films are now held by [[Paramount Television]], with television syndication handled on behalf of Paramount Television by [[Trifecta Entertainment &amp; Media]].

Many of the film and television holdings of [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company]] have now also been incorporated into the Orion library (with ownership currently held by MGM), and the copyright on some of this material is held by Orion, except ''[[Flipper (1995 TV series)|The New Adventures of Flipper]]'' now carries the MGM Television Entertainment copyright.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

MGM still holds distribution rights to the 1980s revival of ''[[The Hollywood Squares|Hollywood Squares]]'' and ''[[High Rollers]]'' the company produced, as well as the remnants of the Heatter-Quigley library that was not erased, including all remaining episodes of the original ''Squares''; they do not own the rights to the format, which is currently owned by [[CBS Television Distribution]], successor-in-interest to King World, who purchased the format rights in 1991 and produced another syndicated revival from 1998 to 2004.

Orion distributed the first [[Rambo (film series)|Rambo film]], ''[[First Blood]]'' (1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=First Blood (1982) 'FIRST BLOOD'|date=22 October 1982|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0DE0DB143BF931A15753C1A964948260|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That film, like the rest of the ''Rambo'' franchise, is now owned by [[StudioCanal]] as a result of purchasing the library of its co-distributor, [[Carolco Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=The rise and fall of Carolco|date=11 March 2014|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/233689/the-rise-and-fall-of-carolco|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otto Miskolczy''' ({{lang-hr| Oto Miškolci}}: 23 January 1909{{spaced ndash}}1978) was [[Croats|Croatia]]n  entrepreneur and [[World War II]] [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]].

Miskolczy was born in [[Vinkovci]] on January 23, 1909 to a notable Croatian [[Jews|Jewish]] family Miskolczy. His brother was [[Eugen Miskolczy]]. In Vinkovci he finished public elementary school and [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in 1927. In 1931 he graduated from the [[Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Zagreb]]. After graduation his father sent him on a one-year specialization in [[Trieste]], hoping that he will lead the family trading company after return. At first Miskolczy worked with his father at the family company, but in 1937 he founded his own company "Oto Miškolci" za trgovinu i proizvodnju zemaljskih proizvoda (''for trade and manufacture of land products''). His mother inherited the family company from his father. During World War II, in order to avoid arrest and deportation, all members of Miskolczy family have escaped to [[Croatian Littoral]] which was then under Fascist Italy. Miskolczy settled in [[Crikvenica]]. But soon [[Italian Fascism|Fascists]] yielded under [[Nazism|Nazis]] pressure, and all Jews were interned in camps on the coast and islands. Miskolczy was imprisoned at the concentration camp Kraljevica. In 1943 Italian fascist closed the camp in Kraljevica and moved all prisoners to the [[Rab concentration camp]]. After the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|capitulation of Italy]] and the liberation of the camp, Miskolczy joined the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]]. There worked as a stenographer and stenotypist. After the war he worked for the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|SR Croatia]] Government in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], and later at the Ministry of supply in [[Zagreb]]. He soon retired due to the deteriorated health and returned to Vinkovci, where he married and helped his wife Ela in the newly formed company. As a most Croatian Jews, Miskolczy was deeply disappointed with the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]n government and made [[Aliyah]] to [[Israel]] with his wife and mother Berta. He died in Israel in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jaša Romano|1980|p=443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pupvg"&gt;{{hr icon}} Josip Šarčević: ''[http://free-vk.t-com.hr/Josip-Sarcevic/gospodarstvenici.htm Poznati učenici i profesori Vinkovačke gimnazije]'': pp. 34, 35: year 2004/2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Tomo Šalić|2002|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

===  Early life ===

Paul David Wilson was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. He was third son to father, Herbert, a classical tenor vocalist and choir director who taught elementary school and retired after becoming a vice-principal of the school.  Paul's mother, Odessa, was a child prodigy who grew to become a concert pianist and choir director.  She was accomplished in a variety of music genres, but due to her commitment to God, only performed certain styles of music.  Paul's early lessons on piano came from his mother, and he grew up absorbing the [[Classical music|classical]] and [[gospel music]] of the choirs and vocal ensembles his parents directed.

While still of pre-school age, Paul began composing simple songs and by the time he began primary school had learned to musically notate the songs he composed.  At age 12, Paul began organizing "street corner" vocal ensembles to perform his songs at parties and selected school functions.  At 13, he discovered the flute and it soon became his major instrument. Paul attended James H. [[Bowen High School]] in Chicago. In Paul's fourth year of high school, a friend, Arlene Johnson, persuaded him to run for class president.  He was elected Senior Class President of Bowen in 1970.

He remembers the day when he was a still-young teenager and "my mother dragged me to a seminar on how to create [[Advertising|commercial]] [[jingles]]." The presenters were [[Dick Marx]], whose young son would later become a pop music star known as [[Richard Marx]], who was then Chicago's most prominent master of music for Radio and TV commercials,  and Dr. Thomas Fabish, the concert master of [[DePaul University]]’s music department. The presentation involved a big band, top-notch singers and a film. Even as he listened, Paul was thinking, "I could do that."

Inspired by Primous Fountain III, a young composer at DePaul University, Paul enrolled and majored in music composition and theory.  He studied music composition with Dr. Leon Stein, Dr. Phil Winsor and Darlene Cowles, while taking flute with Philip Seeburg and Joseph Kainz.  In 1973, he was one of 20 music students from around the U.S. selected by [[Ron Logan]] of [[Walt Disney Entertainment]] to participate in a professional "work experience." Paul remembers it as one of the major highlights of his college career. He wrote at that time in August 1973:

[[Image:piccolo.png|thumb|left|Paul's playing piccolo at [[Disneyland]] -- circa 1973.]]
: {{cquote|This work experience for me came at an extremely timely point in my life as far as my musical growth is concerned. Although I had known what I actually wanted to do before starting the program, it has helped me crystallize my personal goals and ambitions, professionally and avocationally, specifically writing, arranging, and performing music in the popular and jazz idioms.}}

During his study at DePaul, he founded, performed in, and composed for many ensembles and often organized concerts and productions that featured works by him and others. In his senior year, Paul was honored by inclusion in "Who's Who Among Students in American Universities &amp; Colleges"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whoswhoamongstudents.com/history.asp Whosewhoamongstudents.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201164827/http://whoswhoamongstudents.com/history.asp |date=2009-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated in 1975 with a B.A. in music composition and theory.

=== Career ===

In May 1974, while a senior at DePaul, he landed part-time employment at "Star Point 7," a music production company founded by Chuck Colbert, a producer/musician with a jazz-rock band, [[American Breed]] ("[[Bend Me, Shape Me]]"). Paul started this "job" as an unpaid go-fer, answering phones and doing basic clerical chores. After two months, Paul was eager for a chance to show what he could contribute and saw the situation as an opportunity.  "Chuck and his writing partner had parted ways and he needed someone to help finish a project. I was around and available and had the skills. I had to ask him, what are you waiting for?" Once Paul had called attention to his talents, Colbert began using him as a composer and arranger.

A short time later, in the Summer of 1974, Paul met a young musician who was just completing his military service, Danny Leake. At the time, Danny was a talented songwriter and electric guitar player, but would later become one of America's foremost recording studio engineers and one of Paul's closest and most frequent collaborators.

In the Fall of 1975, Danny played a significant role in Paul's life by introducing him to [[Ian Levine]], a producer and songwriter, who was a celebrated member of the [[Europe]]an black music fan base known as the [[Northern Soul]] scene. In 1975, while working with Ian, Paul composed, arranged and produced for [[Dance music|Dance]], [[R&amp;B]] and Northern Soul recording artists, in the course of which he traveled in the U.S. and England.  One of the Levine's artists, [[Evelyn Thomas]], scored a chart hit with her first single, reaching the UK Top 30 in 1976 with the single "Weak Spot," and "which was (co-written and) arrangement by Paul."&lt;ref name=weakspot2&gt;{{cite web|last=Answers.com|title=Evelyn Thomas Biography/"Weak Spot" A song written by Ian Levine and Paul David Wilson|url= http://www.answers.com/topic/evelyn-thomas|work=Answers.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=weakspot3&gt;{{cite web|title=Weak Spot, A song written by Ian Levine and Paul David Wilson |url=http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&amp;blnPublisher=True&amp;blnArtist=True&amp;page=1&amp;keyid=1621902&amp;ShowNbr=0&amp;ShowSeqNbr=0&amp;querytype=WorkID |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130118063833/http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&amp;blnPublisher=True&amp;blnArtist=True&amp;page=1&amp;keyid=1621902&amp;ShowNbr=0&amp;ShowSeqNbr=0&amp;querytype=WorkID |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-18 |work=BMI |year=1975 |accessdate=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=weakspot4&gt;{{cite web|last=Nigel |title=Remember When 1976/Evelyn Thomas/"Weak Spot"A song  written by Ian Levine and Paul David Wilson |url=http://www.yearsofgold.org.uk/1976WEEK8FEB21.htm |work=Nigel’s Golden Days |date=February 1976 |accessdate=2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821101416/http://www.yearsofgold.org.uk/1976WEEK8FEB21.htm |archivedate=2008-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   As the writer, Neil Rushton, wrote in a review which appeared in Black Echoes, "Paul put the incredible zinging, scurrying strings in "Your Magic Put A Spell In Me" &lt;ref name=strings&gt;{{cite news | first=Neil |last=Rushton|title= The Man Who Puts Zing Into Levine’s Strings – Paul Wilson |work=Black Echoes, Northern Soul |publisher=Black Echoes, Ltd. |date=April 3, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|DN_XdJEUJt4}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed by [L.J Johnson [[Ian Levine]]] for Ian Levine productions and also served as the songwriter and arranger for the "1976 Disco classic, originally sung by [[James Wells (activist)|James Wells]],&lt;ref name=firsttimearound&gt;{{cite news |url= http://martinsbox.tripod.com/id17.htm |first=John |last=Abbey |title=James Wells: first time around|work=Place &amp; Face.|publisher= |date= 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt; called "Baby I'm Still The Same Man."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discomusic.com/records-more/8383_0_2_0_C/ Discomusic.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120723141916/http://www.blinkx.com/video/angelo-starr-baby-i-m-still-the-same-man/Pq2vTo-Yx47RSp7TiCjulQ Blinkx.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the success and trans-Atlantic travel he was experiencing, Paul still lived at home with his mother and father. One day in early 1976, while diligently making "cold calls" from his parents’ basement in hopes of drumming up some fresh music opportunities, Paul found himself talking to [[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler]], a fellow Chicagoan who was already well known in American [[soul music]]. Butler had (with [[Curtis Mayfield]]) been one of the original founding members of [[The Impressions]] and then established a long later career as a celebrated solo artist.  That lucky phone call not only gave Paul a chance to meet Butler, but soon led to the opportunity to work with him on a few projects, including three albums "Suite For The Single Girl",&lt;ref name=singlegirl&gt;{{cite news|first=Jerry|last=Butler|url=http://www.discogs.com/Jerry-Butler-Suite-For-The-Single-Girl/release/425713 |authorlink=Jerry Butler (singer) |author2=Paul David Wilson |title="Suite For The Single Girl" Produced by Jerry Butler and Paul David Wilson |work=Jerry Butler |publisher=Motown|date= 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "It All Comes Out In My Song" (title song) and Thelma (Houston) &amp; Jerry&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140707194103/http://www.discogs.com/Thelma-Houston-Jerry-Butler-Thelma-Jerry/release Discogs.com]&lt;/ref&gt; for the Motown label.  Subsequently, Paul and Butler they produce an album on [[Dee Dee Sharp]]-Gample with Philadelphia International.  ''Billboard'' said, "writer/co-producer Paul Wilson’s "Invitation" is a regal, touching trumph that alone would have made for worthwhile album."  In 1981 with "Breaking and Entering" / "Easy Money," from Sharp-Gamble's album "Dee Dee", Paul's production spent four weeks at number one on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart and Dance Chart Billboard.

After two years of working with Chuck Colbert and learning the myriad business-related details one must to be successful in commercial music production, in 1976, at age 24, Paul founded [[Herschel Commercial, Inc]] ("I just named it Hershel Commercial, Inc. because it rhymed, he notes)&lt;ref name=ebony&gt;{{cite book|title= Jingling All The Way To The Bank, Jingle Paul Wilson |url=

His first client was Chicago-based [[Burrell Communications Group, LLC]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burrell.com/burrell.html Burrell.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122041202/http://burrell.com/burrell.html |date=2009-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by Tom Burrell.  Although Anna Morris, the creative director of Burrell, thought Paul might benefit from a little more "seasoning" before going out on his own, he proclaimed with great certainty, "Look, I’m ready!" Now, as impressed with his confidence as with his talents, Morris awarded him a package of several arranging spots to produce for Coca-Cola. The tracks featured Kitty Heywood, a sweet-voiced soul singer who had already performed on a number of albums as well as commercials. Once produced, the spots were enthusiastically received, both at the ad agency and at the client. Paul was soon creating and producing a long list of memorable and award-winning spots for Burrell and many other ad agencies, often working with such established artists as: [[Phyllis Hyman]], [[Lena Horne]], [[Anita Baker]], [[Midnight Star]], [[Walter Jackson (singer)|Walter Jackson]], [[The Dells]], [[Peabo Bryson]], Ada Dyer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windowsmedia.com/MediaGuide/Templates/ArtistProfile.aspx?p_id=P%20%20%20%20%204146 Windowsmedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vickie Winans]], [[Tramaine Hawkins]], [[The Bar-Kays]], [[Valerie Simpson]], [[Jo Armstead|Joshie Jo Armstead]], [[Millie Jackson]] and [[Rufus Thomas]].

Also of note is the score Paul composed for a television film "Happy Birthday, Martin" sung by [[Joshie Jo Armstead]], which is on permanent display at the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site|King Center]] in [[Atlanta]].

=== Leo Burnett Worldwide ===

In 1977, a chance meeting at a barbershop brought Paul to the attention of Don Richards, a young vice-president and account executive at [[Leo Burnett Worldwide]], Chicago's largest and most celebrated advertising agency. Richards had been hired to facilitate Burnett's efforts to identify promising new African American staffers and suppliers, so he was ready to talk business even on a weekend trip to his barber. On hearing the young composer's story, Richards handed him a card, saying, "Call me… next week."  Paul made sure he called Richards.  That meeting was most fortunate for Paul and for Herschel. It set them on the path to success and helped establish their reputation with even the biggest and best clients, which included such major brand names as [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]], [[Quaker Oats]], [[Campbell Soup Company]], [[United Airlines]], [[Kellogg Company]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company]], [[Anheuser Busch]], [[Busch Entertainment]], [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]], [[Mars Incorporated]], [[Alberto-Culver]] and [[Oprah Winfrey]]’s [[Harpo Productions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|fWwTjo3xngo}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Oprah Winfrey]]).  In 1980, People magazine, they featured an article on Paul.  The title was "Lookout.  A Guide To The Up And Coming."     &lt;ref name=lookout&gt;{{cite news |title= Lookout – A Guide To The Up And Coming, Paul David Wilson

"Until 1981, I was known for lavish, heartwarming arrangements," says Wilson, who is a classically trained flutist with degrees in composition and orchestration. "Then I had a hit with "I Wanna Pop! I Wanna [[Shasta (soft drink)|Shasta]]!" and suddenly I was the rock ‘n’ roll guy, the king of the synthesizers."&lt;ref name="TheHotJingleHouses"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mary Jo |last=Kaplan |title=The Hot Jingle Houses, "Sing Along With Pitch" - Herschel Commercial, Paul David Wilson |work=[[Advertising Age]], [[Creativity]] |publisher=Crain Communications |date=August 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|description=Paul David Wilson compose "Calling Me Home, Chicago" featuring Lee Montgomery (1985).}}

In 1985, Paul scored a true "crossover hit" when a song he’d created for [[Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau]] and composed both lyrics and music featuring Lee Montgomery "[[Calling Me Home, Chicago]]," a song written for a $10 million state tourism campaign,&lt;ref name=SongOfChicago&gt;{{cite news |title=Lifeline, Song Of Chicago, "Calling Me Home, Chicago," Songwriter -Paul David Wilson |work=[[USA Today]], Life |publisher=Gannett Co., Inc. |date=December 17, 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; became so instantly popular that it was released as a single and sold through area record stores.&lt;ref name=song&gt;{{cite news|title=Chicago!

We expected the competition to be fierce. It was not.  One airing of Paul's musical vision was enough to win him the job, and to help us create one of the most memorable and successful tourism campaigns in Chicago history.  I believe in the power of words, but the power of Paul's music, his notes, proved mightier than any pen on this day."  That song is widely regarded even today as one of the true "classic" songs of Chicago.

[[Ruth L. Ratny]], the owner of the magazine "Screen" and editor, she wrote, "Among the most memorable for the Illinois Department of Tourism, are the unforgettable  "Calling Me Home, Chicago."  State tourism director Lynda Simon says isn’t surprised that Wilson was able to write words and that went a long way towards popularizing the agency's first major television campaign.  "He’s a  very talented and creative person," says Simon, "and he’s a joy to work with." &lt;ref name=BestoftheYear&gt;{{cite news |first=Ruth |last= Ratny |title=Best Of The Year, The Composer - Paul Wilson |work=Screen Magazine |publisher=Screen Magazine |date=December 16, 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recording and live performance===
In 1987, because of his desire to re-enter the record business, Paul (with attorney Linda Mensch) discovered and produced a new artist, "[[Nikki (singer)|Nikki]]."  Eventually signed to [[Geffen Records]], the debut album entitled "Nikki" was released in the summer of 1989. One song, "Notice Me"&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|hjUPhhWUKaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a hit, reaching #21 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and #11 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart,&lt;ref name=noticeme&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul David |last=Wilson |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p13798|pure_url=yes}}| authorlink=Nikki (singer) |author2=Paul David Wilson  |title=Notice Me, songwriters - Paul David Wilson/Nikki |work=Nikki [[The Billboard Hot 100]] |publisher=Nielsen Company |year= 1990|accessdate=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing Paul honors from [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] as writer and publisher of one of the most performed songs of the year.&lt;ref name=noticemebmi&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul David |last=Wilson |url=http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&amp;blnPublisher=True&amp;blnArtist=True&amp;keyID=1089389&amp;ShowNbr=0&amp;ShowSeqNbr=0&amp;querytype=WorkID |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130118080014/http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&amp;blnPublisher=True&amp;blnArtist=True&amp;keyID=1089389&amp;ShowNbr=0&amp;ShowSeqNbr=0&amp;querytype=WorkID |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-18 |authorlink=Nikki (singer) |author2=Paul David Wilson |title=Notice Me, songwriters - Paul David Wilson/Nikki |work=[[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] |publisher=Broadcast Music, Inc. |year=1990 |accessdate=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1989, Paul was called on by noted choral conductor Nathan Carter to orchestrate Robert Ray's "Gospel Mass" for a joint performance of the [[Morgan State University]] Choir and the [[Detroit Symphony]].  Also in 1989, Paul was appointed conductor/artistic director for a concert series entitled "Classic Black" (Executive Produced by Valarie Norman).  The first concert was given at Chicago's [[Symphony Center|Orchestra Hall]] in April 1990.

Paul wrote:

: {{cquote|I’m happy where I’m at, " he says, "but I’m not so happy that I don’t want to go forward. I’m still reaching for other goals.  I don’t know, maybe I’ll never be satisfied so long as I know there are new musical mountains to climb.&lt;ref name=ebony/&gt;}}

[[Image:Paul &amp; Frank.png|thumb|left|[[Frank Thomas (baseball, born 1968)|Frank Thomas]] and Paul David Wilson put the ink on the deal for Un-D-Nyable Entertainment, February 10, 1997.]]

In 1997, Wilson accepted an offer from Frank Thomas, "The Big Hurt"&lt;ref&gt;[http://biography.jrank.org/pages/2715/Thomas-Frank.html Biography.jrank.org]&lt;/ref&gt; the star player and home run hitter of the [[Chicago White Sox]], to serve as President of [[Un-D-Nyable Entertainment]], an [[independent record label]].   Paul agreed to run the label in partnership with Thomas.

: {{cquote| My executive responsibility is to manage the day-to-to operations, hire creative talent, set up business  relations with manufacturers and distributors and, above all, to find new and exceptional talent.  (Screen, Vol. 19, No. 6, February 10, 1997)}}

Their initial release was a CD single entitled "3-5, The White Sox Got’em Open Up Wide," with Frank Thomas featuring D. Stoy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_/ai_19666520 Findarticles.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Paul discovered and signed Dejah Gomez,&lt;ref name="Answers.com"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/dejah-1998-album-by-dejah Answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt; a precociously talented 14-year-old singer and songwriter, and hired Cleo Powell, who had an established reputation locally for recognizing and nurturing talent, as the label's A&amp;R Director.

In 1998, Wilson hired Jun Mhoon, accomplished both as a musician and an executive at A&amp;M Records, as Executive V.P. General Manager and Maurice White, formerly with Columbia Records, as Promotion Director and Jon Smith, Studio Manager.  He also signed Entourage (James "Slique" Adams,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikimusicguide.com/Slique Wikimusicguide.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Floyd Massey, Eric Wade and Irone Guyton, a R&amp;B singing group), rapper Ant-Dub and STRONG, an R&amp;B group that was a family of five brothers. He then secured the services of songwriters/producers, Jack &amp; Earl and George Claiborne. He soon formed an alliance with the music distributors, Navarro.

In late 1998, Wilson produced the debut CD for Dejah Gomez ("Dejah")&lt;ref name="Answers.com"/&gt; and Entourage ("The Fall Backs of a Playa")&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.music.yahoo.com/singleVideo/?vid=2150397 New.music.yahoo.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.music.yahoo.com/videos/Entourage/When--2150396;_ylt=AqiE6OVWT8569Eu02ik.D_7esyUv New.music.yahoo.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and matching videos for the CD songs and a CD single title "I Can’t Hide" featuring STRONG. In December, a single "When," by Entourage, they charted on Billboard.&lt;ref name=When&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1998-12-26/r-b-hip-hop-songs|title=Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles Sales, "When," Produced by Frank Thomas and Paul David Wilson |work=Billboard [[The Billboard Hot 100]] |publisher=Nielsen Company |year= 1998|accessdate=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon, both Dejah Gomez and Entourage were starting to "take off," but, in January 1999, just as the action and excitement was building for his young record company, Paul Wilson suffered a stroke.

== Health ==

On January 2, 1999, the stroke left the active and energetic 46-year-old composer, producer and businessman suddenly and seriously disabled ([[X-ray computed tomography|CT]]).  The doctors revealed that an ischemic [[Stroke|CVA]] of left MCA with hemorrhagic transformation. Paul was told he’d have to accept lasting and severe restrictions on his ability to verbally communicate, due to the post-stroke condition known as [[Aphasia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/Aphasia.htm Asha.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aphasia is the inability to speak, read, write or understand speech.  Wilson was hospitalized at West Suburban Hospital Medical Center in [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]] and [[Northwestern Memorial Hospital]] in Chicago. Subsequently, he went through rehabilitation at the [[Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago]] and [[Willowbrook State School|Willowbrook]].

Paul wrote:

: {{cquote|In Oak Park Hospital and Northwestern Hospital I stayed for a month or so.  Then, six months in the rehabilitation center to learn just the basic things like saying my name again, signing my signature, spelling my name, my address, brushing my teeth, all the little things that I had to learn to do all over again.}}

In need of a restful setting for his recuperation, Paul and his wife, Terry, relocated to [[Maui]] in [[Hawaii]] where they lived for five years.  Paul eventually found and studied with Dr. Walter Tokishi, a speech therapist, but the scarcity of expert medical support to help him overcome the limitations imposed by his aphasia was still a drawback of living on Maui.  In 2005, he returned to Chicago, where he began an intensive rehabilitation regimen, fiercely determined to resume his musical career.

== Personal life ==
Paul has six brothers. They are:  James Warren (classical/gospel organ, piano), Herbert Liston (Acoustic/electric bass), John Oland (vocalist), Mark Andrew,  Steward Franklin
(B-3, piano). One brother, Mark, died when he was an infant do to heart complication.

Paul has been married and divorced two times and has one stepchild:

*to married Marilyn Baynes from 1978 to 1982;
*to married Terry Moore from 1982 to 2005 with one stepdaughter, Carmen and one grandson.

== Professional Activities &amp; Affiliations ==
He has been a Chicago Chapter Governor and National Trustee of [[The Recording Academy]] ([[NARAS]]) and active on its Education, Finance, Restructuring and Long Range Planning Committee.

'''Public affairs''' generally refer to the building and development of relations between an organization and politicians, governments and other decision-makers.

The industry has developed over recent years and is normally considered a branch or sub-discipline of [[public relations]] (PR).  Given the broad nature of public affairs, what exactly the industry encapsulates remains a point of discussion. While often equated with [[lobbying]], this is usually only a small part of what a public affairs practitioner might do. Other typical functions include research, strategy planning and providing advice.   

It is difficult to determine the size of the public affairs industry in the [[United Kingdom]].  Studies suggest the industry is becoming more professionalized, and that it is more widespread than often assumed. The [[Chartered Institute of Public Relations]] (CIPR), which is the UK's professional body for public relations including public affairs, estimates there are around 48,000 people involved in PR, of which 30%  are involved in public affairs. This research is limited as it only measures specific job titles and those who declare themselves to be working in PR. There are large numbers of professionals providing public affairs services while working under different job titles across a wide variety of sectors. The job titles of public affairs practitioners may vary, depending on the focus of their role, but may include, "public affairs", "external affairs/relations", "corporate communications", "government/parliamentary affairs" and "policy".  

Organizations who make use of public affairs are typically large companies, charities, trade unions, membership organizations and interest groups. They will either have staff working directly for them or employ a firm of public affairs consultants. Very often public affairs staff will work with their non-PR colleagues who are experts in a given field.  

== Issues of contention in the industry == 

It has been argued that professional lobbying goes against [[democracy]] as it allows big business to buy power and influence with well funded campaigns giving them an unfair advantage. Steps are being taken in several countries to attempt to increase levels of regulation and transparency in the public affairs industry. Several countries have introduced a mandatory register for lobbyists. The [[European Union]] has been working with a voluntary register since July 2008. Many other governments including the United Kingdom are debating a register of some kind.

In the [[United States]], President [[Barack Obama]] has introduced several measures intended to increase transparency in public affairs. In an attempt to close the "revolving door" of executive-branch officials becoming lobbyists immediately following the expiration of their federal appointments, he issued [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 13490&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Order 13490 - Ethics Commitments|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/ExecutiveOrder-EthicsCommitments|website=www.whitehouse.gov|publisher=Office of the President of the United States|date=January 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; on January 21, 2009, dictating, among other things, a two-year ban on lobbying for former top executive branch officials related to any issue that they worked on during their final year in government employment. He also introduced a ban on verbal communication between lobbyists and the federal agencies tasked with awarding economic recovery funds. These measures have proved controversial and while some argue they are a positive and necessary step, others have deemed the policies as failures due to various loopholes.

== Role of a public affairs practitioner ==

Public affairs practitioners are engaged in a variety of roles. These can include lobbying, monitoring and predicting political, legal, economic and social developments, and providing political intelligence and strategic advice. In addition, public affairs practitioners may undertake media relations work, understanding and relating with the many streams of business, trade and electronic media in seeking publicity for an organization or in responding to media inquiries and issues. 

Central to all of these areas is the concept of stakeholder relations. Building relationships and partnerships are key when engaging with policymakers.
Consideration should be given to potential partnership with a variety of groups and individuals, usually encompassed in the ubiquitous public affairs term "key stakeholders" which includes community groups, pressure groups, [[nongovernmental organizations]], technical experts and policy and influences from [[think tanks]] and academics.

'''RTI International''' (formerly '''Research Triangle Institute''') is a [[nonprofit organization]] headquartered in the [[Research Triangle Park]] in [[North Carolina]] that provides research and technical services. It was founded in 1958 with $500,000 in funding by local businesses and the three North Carolina universities in the [[Research Triangle]] region. RTI started with departments for research in isotopes, operational sciences and statistics. It restructured into four departments in 1971 and later created the Office for International Projects, now called the International Development Group. 

RTI later split into eleven departments, including Health Research, Drug Discovery &amp; Development, Education &amp; Training Research, Survey Research, among others. The [[US Agency for International Development]] has come to account for 35 percent of RTI's research revenue. RTI research has covered HIV/AIDS, healthcare, education curriculum and the environment, among others. Forbes magazine ranked RTI International sixth of 250 in its America’s Best Employers list for mid-size companies for 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=March 23, 2016|accessdate=April 20, 2016|url=https://www.forbes.com/best-midsize-employers/list/#tab:rank|title=America's Beset Midsize Employers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, RTI acquired business interests in banking/financial consulting to accompany its profitable RTI-Health Solutions, a unit focused on the pharmaceutical and health technology sectors.

In 1971, RTI's staff of 430 was reorganized into four research groups: social and economic systems, statistical sciences, environmental sciences and engineering, and chemistry and life sciences. It also created a division for education called the Center for Education Research and Evaluation.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; Four years later, RTI created the Office for International Programs to manage international projects.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; RTI provided funding assistance to help found the [[North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics]] in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Science, math school opens with first classes|publisher=Associated Press|date=October 3, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two years later was part of a joint venture to create Microelectronics Center of North Carolina (MCNC), a non-profit whose computer network connected local K-12 schools.&lt;ref name="csm"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ruth|last=Walker|title=A research center takes root among pine and possums|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=June 15, 1982|accessdate=January 9, 2013|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1982/0615/061543.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Health Solutions division formed in 2000 serves the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Triangle Business Journal|date=February 20, 2006|accessdate=January 19, 2013|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/stories/2006/02/20/daily4.html?jst=b_ln_hl|title=RTI International Buys Cary Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, it formed a subsidiary in New Delhi, India.

==Organization==
RTI International is a not-for-profit research organization that also includes commercial for-profit industries in business consulting and pharmaceutical sectors. RTI was initially established by three local universities, but managed independently by a separate board and management team.&lt;ref name="csm"/&gt; RTI's structure consists of members of the corporation, the board of governors and corporate officers. The members of the corporation elect governors, who in turn create the organization's policies. Corporate officers are senior managers that report to the board for their area of responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=//www.rti.org/page.cfm/Corporate_Governance|title=Corporate Governance|publisher=The Research Triangle Institute|accessdate=January 9, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606201705/http://rti.org/page.cfm/Corporate_Governance|archivedate=June 6, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTI also has a separate business called RTI Health Solutions, which supports biotech, diagnostic and medical device companies.&lt;ref name="overview"/&gt; As of 2012, the organization's largest division managed the social, statistical and environmental sciences services. More than half of RTI's staff have advanced degrees in one of 120 fields and work on approximately 1,200 projects at a time.&lt;ref name="foo"/&gt; RTI has partnerships with the Research Triangle Energy Consortium, the Triangle Global Health Consortium and other universities and research organizations. Many of RTI's staff hold faculty positions at the three universities that form the Research Triangle and participate in cooperative research projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=//www.rti.org/page.cfm?obj=9EB95F1E-C540-46AE-9BF2BFCE0DD49746|title=University Collaborations|publisher=RTI International|accessdate=February 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218001442/http://www.rti.org/page.cfm?obj=9EB95F1E-C540-46AE-9BF2BFCE0DD49746|archivedate=February 18, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are nine US offices and nine international locations in France, the United Kingdom, South America, India and Indonesia, among others, supporting operations in 80 countries.&lt;ref name="annualreport"/&gt; About 60 percent of RTI's staff are headquartered on a 180-acre campus inside the [[Research Triangle Park]].&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{citation|title=RTI International Overview|url=//www.rti.org/brochures/rti_trifold_w.pdf|publisher=RTI International|accessdate=February 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124023732/http://www.rti.org/brochures/rti_trifold_w.pdf |archivedate=November 24, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of RTI International's funding comes from government research contracts.&lt;ref name="foo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="annual"&gt;{{citation|url=//www.rti.org/annual_reports/2012/rti_ar_2012.pdf|title=2012 Annual Report|publisher=RTI International|accessdate=February 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917082851/http://rti.org/annual_reports/2012/rti_ar_2012.pdf |archivedate=September 17, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it authored 627 journal articles. RTI staff are not independent researchers, but are instead compensated for their time as salary in exchange for yielding any scientific interests in external publications and extramural funding. At the time, RTI owned 400 patents.&lt;ref name="annual"/&gt; RTI competes with the three universities that form the research triangle and other research institutes for contracts. It bids on $2 billion in research contracts a year and wins approximately 40 percent of the budget it bids on.&lt;ref name="foo"/&gt; While RTI is technically a non-profit research institute, senior employees are rewarded salary bonuses (4% for senior staff, and 9-15% for managers) based on annual performance and corporate profit. However, employees have no current vested interest or role in corporate governance.

==Biography==
Rezart Taci was born and raised in Tirana, Albania.  In 1998, he began a career in the trading industry of finished oil products where he worked to establish his name. Mr. Taci has established a portfolio of companies in Energy and Media.{{citation needed|reason=recognized by who?|date=November 2014}} In 2003 Taci established Taçi Oil International Trading and Supply Company Sh.A (Taci Oil). At its inception the company had only six employees and leased storage facilities in Shengjin-Lezhe, a port on the northern coast of Albania.  Later, Taci Oil acquired this facility and expanded operations with additional tankers and added facilities in Porto-Durrës.  The combined storage for the two facilities is over 80,000 cubic meters and expanding. In 2004,  Taci established Anika Enterprises S.A. (ANIKA), a Switzerland-based company acting as the trading arm of Taci Oil, to support his operations and expand his international partnerships.  In 2006, Taci established KUID Sh.p.k (KUID) in order to expand into the retail sector of refined products.  The company began by operating 29 petrol stations. By 2009 the network of petrol stations had expanded to 84.  As of 2012 there were over 300 Taci Oil petrol stations and 1400 employees. In 2008, Taci participated in the international tender for the privatization of Albanian Refining and Marketing of Oil Sh.A (ARMO). Taci was awarded the tender and acquired 85% of the shares of ARMO.  In 2013 Taçi Oil sold 80% of the assets of ARMO, the oil refining business to [[Heaney Assets Corporation]], an Azerbaijan corporation.&lt;ref name="Qoraj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shekulli.com.al/web/p.php?id=28332&amp;kat=87|title=Azerët, nga sot pronarë të ARMO-s, firmoset marrëveshja|publisher=Shekulli|date=7/8/13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313150123/http://www.shekulli.com.al/web/p.php?id=28332&amp;kat=87|archivedate=2014-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Topchannel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.top-channel.tv/english/artikull.php?id=9724|title=ARMO changes owners|publisher=Top Channel|date=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Hennessy''' ({{lang-ga|Ristéard Ó h-Aonghusa}}; 1724 — 8 October 1800) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] military officer and businessman, best known for founding the ''[[Hennessy]]'' [[cognac]] dynasty, which is today a luxury brand and one of the most prominent in the world. From an Irish Catholic family in [[County Cork]], Ireland, Hennessy as with many Irishmen of his generation of a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] political tendency, fled into exile with his fellow [[Flight of the Wild Geese|Wild Geese]] as part of an Irish Catholic military diaspora, serving in the [[French Army]].
==Biography==
===Background and early life===
Richard Hennessy was born in 1724 to James Hennessy and Catherine Barrett at Ballymacmoy House, [[Killavullen]], a small village in [[County Cork]], Ireland. His paternal family were of [[Gaelic Irish]] stock; the Hennessys were anciently of the ''[[Laighin]]'' and claimed descent from a junior branch of the [[O'Dempsey]] family. Specifically with Richard's family, his family were able to restore themselves to a level of prominent through his grandfather's marriage to a daughter of the Norman descended Sir [[Richard Nagle]]. 

Growing up an [[Irish Catholic]] to a family of some ambition, in the aftermath of the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]], whereby Anglo-Protestant hegemony was operative in Ireland, the young Richard Hennessy at the age of 19 elected to leave the country for [[Bourbon France]]. Here he joined the [[Clare Regiment]] of the [[Irish Brigade (France)|Irish Brigade]] in the [[French Army]], serving as an officer. This was in the service of king [[Louis XV of France]]. Shortly after the [[Battle of Fontenoy]] in 1745 he became familiar with the [[Charente]] region, famous for its [[cognac]] production. Using money he had earned in his military career, he decided to become involved in cognac investment from afar, without much success initially.

===Hennessy cognac production===
Richard Hennessy and his cousin James Hennessy went to [[Ostend]] in [[Flanders]] in 1757 to learn how to trade. Upon returning to France in 1765 he decided to settle in the [[Charente]] area permanently with his wife Ellen Barrett (an aunt of the political philosopher [[Edmund Burke]]) and their son Jacques Hennessy (11 October 1765 - 22 April 1843). With the assistance of some of the banking houses in [[Paris]], he and two business partners by the name of Connelly and Arthur began trading in cognac from his house.

During this time the trade in [[alcoholic spirits]] were booming, popular not only with French customers, but also with foreigners, especially people from the [[British Empire]] showing interest, leading to a massive boom in cognac in the 1760s. Indeed, in Hennessy’s homeland, the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], spirits from the European Continent were popular, because customs duties were much lower than those practiced in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. As well as this there was a shortage of [[rum]] due to the [[Seven Years' War]] and "implied that the growing taste for alcohol could only be satisfied by increased imports."

Hennessy expanded his customer base by shipping the product from Cognac to [[London]], [[Dublin]] and Flanders. He also had clients at the Court of the King of France, such as the [[Charles, Prince of Soubise|Prince of Soubise]], familiar with the Charente. However, the Hennessy House was still of negligible importance in the 1770s, and Richard Hennessy left the city in 1776 to settle in [[Bordeaux]], where he had associates, as a distiller, in association with [[alderman]] George Boyd. It was only in the context of the [[French Revolution|revolutionary decade]] that "the Hennessy, until then a minor house, reached the rank of great." Two marriage covenants with an older and firmly established house, the [[Martell (cognac)|Martells]], allowed and endorsed both this promotion in the last decade of the century.

'''Sandiaga Salahuddin Uno''' (born 28 June 1969) is an Indonesian businessman, investor and politician who was the Deputy Governor of [[Jakarta]]. He was elected along with [[Anies Baswedan]] in the [[Jakarta gubernatorial election, 2017|2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election]] after defeating incumbent pair [[Basuki Tjahaja Purnama]] (widely known as "Ahok") and [[Djarot Saiful Hidayat]]. He resigned the office to run as [[Prabowo Subianto]]'s running mate for the [[Indonesian general election, 2019|2019 Indonesian presidential election]].

A graduate of [[George Washington University]], Sandiaga worked for several companies and rose in rank before founding his own business, which led him to become one of the richest people in Indonesia. In 2015, he resigned from his companies to join [[Great Indonesia Movement Party|Gerindra]].

== Career ==
=== Business ===
Sandi Uno graduated from [[Wichita State University]] in 1990 and from [[George Washington University]] with an MBA in 1992, paid by William Soerjadjaja, because his mother personally knew the Astra International group founder.&lt;ref&gt;https://sandiagauno.wordpress.com/2012/05/23/sisi-kelam-pengusaha-muda-sandiaga-uno/&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=August 2018}} He began his career with Summa Bank in 1990. In 1994, he joined MP Group Holding Limited as an investment manager. The following year, he began working for NTI Resources Ltd in [[Canada]] and worked as an Executive Vice President in the company. The 1997 financial crisis hit NTI Resources Ltd hard and caused it to go into administration, leaving him unemployed.&lt;ref name="kompas"/&gt;

In 1997, he co-founded PT. Recapital Advisors with his high school friend, [[Rosan Perkasa Roeslani]]. the following year, he co-founded Saratoga Capital with Edwin Soeryadjaya, son of William Soerjadjaja. Both businesses continue to flourish today. Listed as 29th richest man in Indonesia according to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine in 2009,&lt;ref name="kompas"&gt;{{cite news|language=id|last=Grahadyarini|first=BM Lukita|work=Kompas|date=4 September 2008|url=http://cetak.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/09/04/0124478/kebangkitan.hidup.sandiaga.uno|title=Kebangkitan Hidup Sandiaga Uno|accessdate=13 April 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905071646/http://cetak.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/09/04/0124478/kebangkitan.hidup.sandiaga.uno|archivedate=5 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; he continued to grow his businesses, buying a controlling (51%) stake in [[Mandala Airlines]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detikfinance.com/read/2011/05/20/075823/1642986/4/sandiaga-uno-berharap-mandala-bisa-terbang-lagi-juni|title=Sandiaga Uno Berharap Mandala Bisa Terbang Lagi Juni|author=Suhendra|work=detikFinance|date=20 May 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521001839/http://us.detikfinance.com/read/2011/05/20/075823/1642986/4/sandiaga-uno-berharap-mandala-bisa-terbang-lagi-juni|archivedate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in May 2011. He was listed as 47th richest man in Indonesia according to ''Forbes'' in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sandiaga Salahuddin Uno|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/sandiaga-salahuddin-uno/|website=Forbes|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, his name appeared on the list of [[Panama Papers]] (known as Tax Scandal), although he denies he evaded taxes or broke the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nailufar|first1=Nibras Nada|editor-last1=Djumena|editor-first1=Erlangga|title=Sandiaga Uno Benarkan Perusahaannya Ada di "Panama Papers"|url=http://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2016/04/06/12025491/Sandiaga.Uno.Benarkan.Perusahaannya.Ada.di.Panama.Papers.|accessdate=24 January 2017|work=[[Kompas]]|date=6 April 2016|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
He decided to leave the business world, entering politics in mid-2015. In the period from April to July 2015, he officially resigned from various positions in 16 subsidiaries of Saratoga and Recapital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Narita|first1=Indrastiti|editor-last1=Ali|editor-first1=Fidel|title=Sandiaga Uno Lepaskan 16 jabatan di Saratoga|url=http://bisniskeuangan.kompas.com/read/2015/06/04/094317026/Sandiaga.Uno.Lepaskan.16.jabatan.di.Saratoga|accessdate=24 January 2017|work=[[Kompas]]|date=4 June 2015|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joining the [[Gerindra]] party as vice chairman of the board of supervisors, he was catapulted to the second highest office after [[Prabowo Subianto|Prabowo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ningtyas|first1=Ika|editor-last1=|editor-first1=|title=Tinggalkan Bisnis, Sandiaga Uno Akhirnya Masuk Gerindra|url=https://m.tempo.co/read/news/2015/05/07/093664440/tinggalkan-bisnis-sandiaga-uno-akhirnya-masuk-gerindra|accessdate=24 January 2017|work=[[Tempo]]|date=7 May 2015|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; His name began to be considered by Gerindra to be nominated in the [[Jakarta gubernatorial election, 2017|2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election]].

Late in 2015, several volunteer community support groups began to emerge, including "''Sahabat Sandiaga Uno''" (Friends of Sandiaga Uno or SSU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rudi|first1=Alsadad|editor-last1=Afrianti|editor-first1=Desy|title=Datang ke "Car Free Day", Sandiaga Uno Sapa Pendukungnya|url=http://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2015/10/11/09145001/Datang.ke.Car.Free.Day.Sandiaga.Uno.Sapa.Pendukungnya|accessdate=24 January 2017|work=Kompas|date=11 October 2015|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began making visits to various locations within Jakarta. In early 2016, Sandiaga Uno, with assistance of his supporters, began to intensify visits to various locations in Jakarta. Performing visits to up to 7 different locations a day, for the 6-month period from February to August 2016. The rumour of his candidacy intensified, as news leaked of the desire of 7 political parties to form a grand coalition in August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adyatama|first1=Egi|editor-last1=|editor-first1=|title=Pilkada DKI, 7 Partai Bentuk Koalisi Kekeluargaan Lawan Ahok|url=https://m.tempo.co/read/news/2016/08/08/231794172/pilkada-dki-7-partai-bentuk-koalisi-kekeluargaan-lawan-ahok|accessdate=24 January 2017|work=[[Tempo]]|date=8 August 2016|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This desire was not realised following the withdrawal the ruling [[Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle|PDI-P]] party, which threw its weight behind incumbent governor [[Basuki Tjahaja Purnama|Ahok]], along with [[Golkar]], [[People's Conscience Party|Hanura]] and [[Nasdem Party|Nasdem]]. The [[Democratic Party (Indonesia)|Democratic Party]], [[National Mandate Party|PAN]], [[National Awakening Party|PKB]] and [[United Development Party|PPP]] then announced it planned to nominate [[Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono]] (son of former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono) for the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carina|first1=Jessi|editor-last1=Rastika|editor-first1=Icha|title=Agus-Sylvi Nomor 1, Ahok-Djarot Nomor 2, dan Anies-Sandiaga Nomor 3|url=http://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2016/10/25/20421221/agus-sylvi.nomor.urut.1.ahok-djarot.nomor.2.dan.anies-sandiaga.nomor.urut.3|accessdate=21 December 2016|work=Kompas|date=25 October 2016|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining parties, Gerindra and [[Prosperous Justice Party|PKS]], agreed to remain in the coalition, selecting former Education Minister [[Anies Baswedan]] as their candidate, and Sandiaga Uno as his running mate. Sandi said, he had suggested Baswedan to Prabowo because he felt that Baswedan would be more suitable for the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yulika|first1=Nila Chrisna|editor-last1=Sunariyah|editor-first1=Sunariyah|title=Mengapa Sandiaga Uno Berikan Posisi Cagub ke Anies Baswedan?|url=http://pilkada.liputan6.com/read/2611015/mengapa-sandiaga-uno-berikan-posisi-cagub-ke-anies-baswedan|accessdate=24 January 2017|work=Liputan 6|date=26 September 2016|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following victory in the election, which an editorial described as "the most polarizing and most divisive the nation has ever seen in Indonesian political history,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/17/asia/jakarta-election-indonesia/index.html|title=Religious tensions rise in Jakarta as crucial vote gets underway|last=CNN|first=Ben Westcott,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the incarceration of [[Basuki Tjahaja Purnama|Ahok]], he was made vice governor on 16 October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Supporters greet new Jakarta leaders at Sunda Kelapa Mosque|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/10/16/supporters-greet-new-jakarta-leaders-at-sunda-kelapa-mosque.html|accessdate=16 October 2017|work=[[The Jakarta Post]]|date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, he was accused of paying opposition parties [[National Mandate Party|PAN]] and [[Prosperous Justice Party|PKS]] Rp 500 billion (USD 35 million) each to approve him as [[Prabowo Subianto]]'s vice presidential candidate for the [[Indonesian presidential election, 2019|2019 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Political uproar after Sandiaga Uno accused of paying PAN &amp; PKS IDR500 billion each to be Prabowo’s VP pick|url=https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/political-uproar-sandiaga-uno-accused-paying-pan-pks-idr500-billion-prabowos-vp-pick/ |accessdate=9 August 2018 |work=Coconuts Jakarta |date=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, he declared his resignation from his office to participate in the election on 10 August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.viva.co.id/berita/politik/1063417-sandiaga-uno-resmi-mundur-dari-wakil-gubernur-dki|title=Sandiaga Uno resmi mundur dari wakil gubernur DKI|date=10 August 2018|work=VIVA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resignation was made official on 18 September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kabar24.bisnis.com/read/20180918/15/839406/dirjen-otonomi-daerah-disetujui-presiden-jokowi-sandiaga-uno-resmi-tak-jabat-wagub-dki- Dirjen Otonomi Daerah: Disetujui Presiden Jokowi, Sandiaga Uno Resmi Tak Jabat Wagub DKI]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paradise Papers ===
{{See also|Paradise Papers}}In November 2017 an investigation conducted by the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists|International Consortium of Investigative Journalism]] cited his name in [[List of people and organisations named in the Paradise Papers|the list of politicians named in]] "[[Paradise Papers]]" allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/explore-politicians-paradise-papers/|title=Explore The Politicians in the Paradise Papers - ICIJ|work=ICIJ|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was claimed to have own an offshore company named NTI resources, as well as several shell companies in British Virgin Islands. Regarding this, the Indonesian Minister of Finance, [[Sri Mulyani|Sri Mulyani]], vowed to study the legitimacy of the paper, and will take an appropriate measure if there was any wrongdoing conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1031425/perusahaan-prabowo-dan-sandiaga-tersangkut-paradise-papers/|title=Perusahaan Prabowo dan Sandiaga tersangkut Paradise Papers - Tempo|work=Tempo.co|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Program===
Even before his appointment to the vice governorship, Sandiaga proceeded to execute plans mentioned during his campaigning. In early October, an entrepreneurship program dubbed ''OK OCE'' (One Kecamatan, One Center for Entrepreneurship), which he had called for during the election, was initiated with his elder brother Indra initially acting as president, although the following day he was replaced due to nepotism concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Haq|first1=Muhammad Fida Ul|title=Kakak Sandiaga akan Pimpin Program OK OCE, Dapat Dana APBD Rp 1,5 M|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/3678855/kakak-sandiaga-akan-pimpin-program-ok-oce-dapat-dana-apbd-rp-15-m|accessdate=2 December 2017|work=detiknews|date=11 October 2017|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Keputusan Sandiaga Uno Copot Kakaknya Dari Ketua OK OCE Diapresiasi|url=http://wartakota.tribunnews.com/2017/10/12/keputusan-sandiaga-uno-copot-kakaknya-dari-ketua-ok-oce-diapresiasi|accessdate=2 December 2017|work=Wartakota|publisher=[[Kompas Gramedia]]|date=12 October 2017|language=id-ID}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Siviløkonom''' (literally "civil economist") is an [[academic degree]] issued within the field of [[business administration]] and a professional title in [[Norway]] (with corresponding titles in [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]], see below under "See also"), obtained after 3 to 5 years of studies. The title is protected and can only be used by persons having met certain qualifications as directed by the [[Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research]]. It is mainly offered by nine institutions after the completion of a [[Master of Science in Business Administration]].

Master of Science in Business Administration programs entitling the Siviløkonom in Norway are:
* [[Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences]] (HiOA) ([[Oslo]])
* [[Bodø Graduate School of Business]] ([[University of Nordland|UiN]]) ([[Bodø]])
* [[NHH|Norwegian School of Economics]] (NHH) ([[Bergen]])
* [[BI Norwegian Business School]] (BI) ([[Oslo]])
* [[Norwegian University of Life Sciences]] ([[Ås, Akershus|Ås]])
* [[Buskerud University College]] ([[Hønefoss]])
* [[Molde University College]] ([[Molde]])
* [[Trondheim Business School]] ([[Sør-Trøndelag University College|HiST]]) ([[Trondheim]])
* [[University of Agder]] ([[Kristiansand]])
* [[University of Stavanger]] ([[Stavanger]])
* [[University of Tromsø]] ([[Tromsø]])

Additionally, the title can be granted to candidates with foreign education meeting certain criteria, through application to the NHH. Due to changes in the Norwegian educational system, granting of the title based on foreign education will be phased out on 12/31/2008, and can through that date only be granted to persons who started their qualifying education prior to 1/1/2003.

==History==
Traditionally the siviløkonom degree was only offered at NHH in [[Bergen]], and was originally a two-year, then three-year program.  In 1975 it became a four-year business administration degree at the level equivalent to a [[cand.mag.]] degree. NHH had a monopoly on awarding the degree until 1985 when the Norwegian School of Management BI and the Bodø Graduate School of Business was allowed to offer the degree. After the [[Norwegian higher education quality reform|quality reform]] all institutions of higher education were allowed to issue the title to all master graduates, and the requirements for the degree increased from four to five years of study.

West Heath School is an independent [[school]] in [[Sevenoaks]], [[Kent]]. It caters for children for whom mainstream schooling has become insufficient, for varying reasons. The school's motto is "Rebuilding Lives Through Education."

The school, founded in its current form as a [[charitable trust]] on 14 September 1998 as the Beth Marie Centre, is based in {{Convert|31|acre}} of parkland on lease from [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]], who contributed almost £3 million towards the school. The building formerly housed the school where [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana Spencer, later Princess of Wales]] and her two older sisters, [[Lady Sarah McCorquodale|Sarah]] and [[Jane Fellowes, Baroness Fellowes|Jane]], received their childhood education. It was then called West Heath Girls' School and was a very exclusive girls' school with around 100 boarding pupils.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==History and grounds==
===West Heath School=== &lt;!-- "West Heath School" redirects here --&gt;
The Reverend Philip Bennet Power and his wife, Emma, undertook the education of their own daughters at their [[Abbey Wood]] home, West Heath House. The quality of the girls' education attracted other local families to ask the Powers to teach their children and West Heath School thus opened in 1865.&lt;ref name="WHOGA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whoga.org.uk/History.html| title=West Heath – A Short History |publisher=West Heath Old Girls Association |accessdate=9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bexley.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=10409 |title=West Heath House, No.115 Woolwich Road, Erith |publisher=[[London Borough of Bexley]] |date= |accessdate=9 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312022403/http://www.bexley.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=10409 |archivedate=12 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1879 the expanding school moved to [[Cassel Hospital|1 Ham Common]], in what was then the agricultural community of [[Ham, London|Ham]], [[Surrey]]. The house, set in over {{convert|10|acres|ha}} of grounds, was the former residence of the [[Prince Robert, Duke of Chartres|Duc de Chartres]].&lt;ref name="WHOGA"/&gt; 

In 1890 Misses Sarah, Maria and Anna Buckland and Miss Jane Percival who owned a similar school in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] joined forces with the ageing Mrs Power at Ham Common and they ran the school until its purchase in 1900 by Misses Emma Lawrence and Margaret Skeat. Miss Elliott joined the staff in 1928 and was appointed Principal the following year.&lt;ref name="WHOGA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP2K"&gt;{{cite book |year=2000 |editor-first=Leonard |editor-last=Chave |title=Ham and Petersham at 2000 |publisher=Ham Amenities Group |page=25 |isbn=9780952209942}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The development of nearby shops and housing prompted a second move, Ham having become "too suburbanised for a high class girls' school".&lt;ref name="HP2K"/&gt; In 1932 the school moved to its present site, the 18th century Ashgrove House, near [[Sevenoaks]], the former home of the [[T. S. Eliot|Elliot]] family. The larger premises allowed the school to grow from its previous capacity at Ham of about seventy boarders, to over one hundred by the end of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="WHOGA"/&gt; 

In addition to the Spencer sisters, [[Issy Van Randwyck]], Annabel Croft and [[Tilda Swinton]] were educated there.

In the 1990s the school had financial difficulties due to falling numbers of pupils, and was placed into receivership in 1997.

===West Heath School===
The [[Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund]] considered buying the school, but decided against it, and Mohamed Al Fayed stepped in to buy West Heath for £2,300,000 on 20 May 1998 as new premises for the Beth Marie Centre. He later pledged to contribute a further £550,000 towards equipping the school. In a statement, he said:

:I am surprised that the [[Princess Diana Memorial Fund]], with all its millions in the bank, did not show a greater interest in this project. I believe it to be a far more fitting tribute to her work than putting her name on tasteless souvenirs.&lt;ref name="Chron"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chron.com/cgi-bin/auth/story/content/chronicle/special/princess/0521school.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303082000/http://www.chron.com/cgi-bin/auth/story/content/chronicle/special/princess/0521school.html |archivedate=3 March 2008 |title=Mohamed Al Fayed buys Diana's former school |date=21 May 1998 | accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was founded in its current form, with Valerie May as Principal, on 14 September 1998. At the start it had around 30 pupils. [[Boarding school|Boarding]] began in the year 2000, and there are six boarding houses, each named after one of the trustees (see "Management", below); Tarrant, Sissons, Astor, Ruth, Hunniford and Esther.

An additional, more modern, teaching block was built to increase the classroom capacity and overall space for the school.

The entertainer and singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], who visited the school in 2010, has funded the educational progression through it of one pupil (who has been kept anonymous).

==Management==
Founding [[Patronage|patron]]: Mohamed Al-Fayed

The school is governed by a board of 10 Trustees

School management:
* [[School principal|Principal]]: Jim Nunns
* Deputy Principal: Nick Oldham
* Head of Education ([[Secondary education|school]]): Nick Taylor
* Head of Boarding:  
* Head of Post-16 (school support at [[Sixth form college|colleges]]): Paul Conforth

==General information==
Policy, syllabuses, schemes of work and National Curriculum documents can be made available on request to the Head of Education.
* Criteria for pupils: 11 to 19 years old, female or male.
Disabilities which pupils may have include: [[acute stress disorder]], [[Substance dependence|addiction]], [[affective spectrum]], [[agoraphobia]], [[anorexia nervosa]], [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD/ADD), [[autism spectrum]]/[[high functioning autism]], [[avoidant personality disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[bulimia nervosa]], [[conduct disorder]], [[developmental delay]], [[clinical depression]], [[dyslexia]], [[developmental coordination disorder]], [[epilepsy]], [[exhibitionism]], [[genetic disorders]], [[hysteria]], [[nervous breakdown]], [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]] (OCPD), [[oppositional defiant disorder]], (ODD), [[general anxiety disorder]] (GAD), [[impulse control disorder]] ([[kleptomania]], [[intermittent explosive disorder]], [[pyromania]], [[pathological gambling]], [[trichotillomania]]), emotional or [[Human behavior|behavioural]] difficulties, [[pathological demand avoidance]] (PDA), [[panic attack]]s, [[pervasive developmental disorder]] (PDD), [[seasonal affective disorder]] (SAD), [[self-harm]] (SH), [[separation anxiety disorder]]/[[school refusal]], [[selective mutism]], [[semantic pragmatic disorder]], [[social anxiety]] (social phobia), [[Tourette syndrome]], [[Transgender]] and other various [[mental health]] problems.

Many of the disadvantaged pupils have not had the opportunity to get a formal [[Special education in England|Statement of Special Needs]] (SSEN) for various reasons.
* Costs – £15,790 p/a ([[per annum]]) for day pupils, £42,972 p/a for residential (boarding) pupils.

Each pupil has an annual review each year to determine if their needs are being met and what changes if any need to be made in their education. Recently{{When||date=February 2013}} the school had to cut back hard on funding due to a decrease in charity donations. Al-Fayed ceased funding the school.
It received some money from [[Children in Need]] in 2004, and teachers and pupils also partook in fund-raising activities for Children in Need as a whole, for example sponsored silences, head shaves, makeup-for-the-day and so on.
* Entry – Entering the school requires a Local Education Authority procedure or [[Social Services#United Kingdom|Social Services]] referral, as the school has the status as a [[Special School]].
* Number of pupils – 101

==Post 16==
As well as teaching pupils from Years 7 to 11, the school operates a section allowing pupils to get "support" from the school while going to college; the school itself does not have staff to teach subjects at A-level. Many continue boarding at the school while going to college elsewhere.

==Fund a Child's Education (FaCE)==
The New School has set up a fundraising drive, FaCE (Fund a Child's Education) to enable it to help children in need of the school to move from its very large waiting list of potential pupils.

'''Theodorico César de Sande Pacheco de Sacadura Botte''' ([[Quinta da Bica|Quinta da Bica, Portugal]], October 31, 1902 - [[Maputo|Maputo, Mozambique]], November 18, 1987), commonly known as '''Theodorico de Sacadura Botte''',&lt;ref name=Machado&gt;

Born into a Portuguese rural aristocratic family, Sacadura Botte left [[Lisbon]] and moved to the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese African Overseas]] in the wave of State takeover of the [[Colonialism|colonial administration]] from the British-owned private companies it was formerly commissioned to. After many years as a colonial administrator, and having been Administrator of two different districts, as well as Chief of Cabinet of the Governor of Mozambique, he became an entrepreneur and businessman, with strong interests in [[international trade]], [[real estate]], horticulture and agriculture.

After the fall of the Portuguese authoritarian regime known as [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]], all Portuguese overseas territories in Africa were granted independence. Most of the political factions that took over these new countries were [[Marxism|marxist]] [[guerilla warfare|guerilla]] movements, which started a wave of nationalization of properties and businesses, as well as, in many cases, persecution of Portuguese nationals. Although Sacadura Botte saw most of his property taken or destroyed and most of his family and friends exiled, he remained in Mozambique and acknowledged the new regime, thus earning the respect of the new leaders and of the Mozambican people, who mostly left him in peace. This was also, in all likeliness, fueled by the fact that he was considered a just and kind governor by the people under his rule in both his jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Memoir"/&gt;

In his final years, he wrote a memoir, titled ''"Memórias e Autobiografia: 24 anos em Portugal e 60 em Africa"'' (Memoirs and Autobiography: 24&amp;nbsp;years in Portugal and 60 in Africa), which told his life story and is considered by many to be a great instrument of insight into the final years of the Portuguese Overseas Empire, as well as an interesting account of most of the 20th century through the eyes of a member of the last generation of Portuguese colonialists.

Theodorico de Sacadura Botte died in Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, on November 18, 1987, aged 85.

==Early life and departure to Africa==
Sacadura Botte was born on 31 October 1902 at the family manor of Quinta da Bica, in [[Seia Municipality|Seia, Portugal]], near [[Serra da Estrela]].&lt;ref name=Memoir/&gt; He was the fifth and last son of João Pacheco de Sacadura Botte, 8th Lord of the Bica House and Estate, and Maria da Ascenção Mendes de Oliva, second daughter of the Lords of Ponte Pedrinha. His father was a magistrate, landowner and winemaker, as well as a [[Monarchism|monarchist]] politician and candidate for the [[Beira (Portugal)|Beira region]]. As a young boy, Theodorico lived through the [[5 October 1910 revolution|fall of the Portuguese Monarchy]], much to the dismay of his traditional, Catholic and monarchist family, and helped his father in his campaign as monarchist candidate to the government of the region where they lived in Portugal, albeit unsuccessfully.

He started his studies in [[Coimbra]], and then studied Business and Economical Sciences, at the ''Instituto Superior de Comércio'' in Lisbon. After finishing his studies, he considered the diplomatical career, but could not follow this idea due to the [[Republicanism|republican]] nature of the Portuguese regime at the time, with which he profoundly disagreed. For the following two years, he ran the agricultural production of his father’s estate. Afterwards, and giving up the idea of joining the diplomatic corps, he was invited by his good friend José de Moura Forjaz de Gusmão, then manager of the “Sociedade Colonial de Tabacos”, the Portuguese Colonial Tobacco Society, to move to [[Africa]] on a three-year commission, as a bookkeeper for that same company. Accepting the invitation, and against his family’s wishes, Sacadura Botte left for the Portuguese colony of [[Portuguese São Tomé and Príncipe|São Tomé and Príncipe]], boarding the ''Angola'' steamship, in Lisbon, on May 31, 1926.

It was also during his early years that Sacadura Botte developed many of the interests that would accompany him through life. He discovered his favourite sports, [[equestrianism|horse-riding]] and [[hunting]], early in life, being initiated into both in his family's estate. He also had his first close contact with [[silviculture]], which went on to become a later years passion, in one of his maternal family's estates, Quinta do Outeiro, where his maternal grandfather, Theodorico César Mendes de Oliva, created a well known [[botanical garden]] known as ''Bussaquinho'', because of its similarity to the famous [[Serra do Buçaco|Bussaco forest]].

==Arrival in Africa and the tobacco years==

After stops in [[Madeira]], the [[Canary Islands]], [[Portuguese São Tomé and Príncipe]] and [[Luanda]], Sacadura Botte finally arrived in [[Maputo|Lourenço Marques]], capital of the [[Portuguese Mozambique|Portuguese overseas province of Mozambique]], in late June, 1926. He took over his job as bookkeeper for the Lourenço Marques factory of the Colonial Tobacco Society, and moved into the Cardoso Hotel, where he lived during his first tenure in Mozambique.

After little over two years in Mozambique, Sacadura Botte was invited to fill in for the manager of the Luanda factory of the same company, Pedro de Figueiredo e Lemos, who was leaving for Portugal for a year. After taking the offer, he moved to Luanda, where he lived in the manager's suite on the factory premises. After Figueiredo e Lemos' return from Portugal, Sacadura Botte travelled to São Tomé for a month, where he inspected the many tobacco plantations on that island that supplied the Colonial Tobacco Society. After finishing the inspection, and upon arriving in Lourenço Marques, he took over as manager of the Lourenço Marques factory, this time filling in for José de Moura Forjaz de Gusmão, who was leaving for Portugal, also for a year.

Little before Moura Forjaz de Gusmão's return, Sacadura Botte decided to leave the tobacco industry for a career in public administration. Although he was highly regarded within the Tobacco Society, both Figueiredo e Lemos and Moura Forjaz de Gusmão were young and bound to stay on as managers for a long time, and Sacadura Botte felt he should move beyond his bookkeeper position, so he decided to try a different career.

During his first years in Africa, Sacadura Botte often indulged in the pleasures of one of his favourites sports: game hunting. During his many years in Africa, he hunted alongside famous hunters like German aristocrat Baron Werner von Alvensleben, Portuguese industrialist Hermínio Madeira Leitão (who would become Theodorico's son João's father in law), brothers and businessmen José Diogo and Manuel Mascarenhas Gaivão, and his great friend Maximiano Cotta. Sacadura Botte, aside from regular hunting expeditions, also joined many Portuguese colonial figures in hunting trips, having hunted alongside, José Frederico Ulrich, who would later become Portugal's Minister of Public Works, and many others.

==District administrator: Magude==

Throughout the 19th century, the colonization of many of Portugal's overseas provinces was concessioned to private companies, due to Portugal's lack of funds to pursue the development of these areas. One of said companies was the [[Niassa Company]], whose concession covered the regions of Niassa and Cabo Delgado, among others in the [[Portuguese East Africa]]. On October 27, 1929, the Niassa Company's concession expired, and the Portuguese Government refused to grant an extension. This refusal was due to the [[Ditadura Nacional]] regime's belief that the state should head colonization.

In this wave of state takeover of colonial administration, many formerly concessioned districts were now in need of an administrator. The Governor of Mozambique opened a selection process to choose who would occupy these positions. Theodorico de Sacadura Botte, having, as earlier stated, decided to try a different career in which he could have a greater degree of autonomy, applied. He was one of the three chosen candidates, alongside Lieutenants Ribeiro da Silva and Pinto da Fonseca, and chose to administrate the district of Magude.

In his first tenure as District Administrator of Magude, he showed many of the traits that would accompany him throughout his career as a colonial administration. His strong opposition to the forced labour system known as [[chibalo]], as well as his strong defense of the native people and cooperation with local tribes gained enormous respect from the Mozambican population. This was at a time in which natives were used as cheap labour for many of the landowners, and were mostly at their mercy. Although Sacadura Botte faced some opposition at first, soon his uncompromising stand and firm ideals prevailed.

During his time as district administrator, he often went on hunting and riding expeditions, as he so much enjoyed, having at one point lead the hunting expedition devised to obtain a buffalo worthy of figuring in Portugal's exposition in the Exposition Universelle in Paris.

During a stay at a country club he met Incomati Sugar Estates manager Thomas Newman and his wife Leila. They agreed to play a tennis doubles match, and Sacadura Botte was paired with Leila Newman's sister Sheila May Younger. After this first encounter, Sacadura Botte began courting Sheila May, and after her conversion to Catholicism, they were eventually married by Father Alfredo Corrêa de Lima, in Magude. Sheila was the youngest daughter of then already deceased William Douglas Younger, of the renown [[Viscount Younger of Leckie|Younger family]], of [[Clackmannanshire]], [[Scotland]], and his Australian-born British wife, Leila May.

During his term in Magude, Sacadura Botte earned the respect of the locals through his reputation for being a just and fair administrator. His often unorthodox methods in fighting inequality and his refusal to accommodate existing lobbies, especially those which attempted to corrupt him or his officials, garnered him some enemies during that period. Once, upon realizing that the Portuguese businessmen were buying cattle from the locals at a price much lower than its worth, Sacadura Botte forbade any cattle from being sold or bought until fair prices were paid. After some time being unable to buy cattle, the businessmen accepted the fair prices proposed by Sacadura Botte and commerce resumed as usual.

==In Literature==

Sacadura Botte wrote a three-volume set of ''memoirs'', called "Memórias e Autobiografia", which have been considered an insightful look at the final years of the Portuguese Colonial Empire through the eyes of one of its last great colonialists. 

He was also the inspiration for a poem, titled simply ''T.S.B.'', written by Portuguese ambassador to Mozambique [[José Cutileiro]], in which he is compared to Prospero, from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest]]'', and the new Mozambican regime to Caliban, from the same play.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
::::'''T.S.B.'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Today I have met Prospero.&lt;br&gt;
Living in an island under Caliban's rule.&lt;br&gt;
He opted out but he did not go&lt;br&gt;
And treads the ground and breathes the air with no&lt;br&gt;
Allegiance of a subject to the fool&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Fifty or more years ago&lt;br&gt;
He came to settle and has not left since.&lt;br&gt;
The lifetime of a Master. Winds that blow&lt;br&gt;
Deep-rooted trees away shall never throw&lt;br&gt;
Him kneeling in front of the new Prince.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Here he'll die. A vow&lt;br&gt;
To keep forever great that smallness whence he came&lt;br&gt;
That sold him out and sent me now&lt;br&gt;
To honour Caliban. He greets me with a bow&lt;br&gt;
The pride of which redeems the shame of a nation.&lt;br&gt;
:::::::Namacha, 1980

The '''World Programming System''', also known as '''WPS Analytics''' or '''WPS''', is a software product developed by a company called [[World Programming]]. WPS allows users to create, edit and run [[computer programs|programs]] written in the [[SAS language|language of SAS]].&lt;ref name="World Programming System (WPS) – What is WPS?"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldprogramming.com/products/wps/overview|title=World Programming System (WPS) – What is WPS?|accessdate=3 February 2012|publisher=World Programming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was the subject of [[SAS Institute Inc v World Programming Ltd|a lawsuit by SAS Institute]]. The [[European Court of Justice|EU Court of Justice]] ruled in favor of World Programming, stating that the copyright protection does not extend to the software functionality, the programming language used and the format of the data files used by the program. It stated that there is no copyright infringement when a company which does not have access to the source code of a program studies, observes and tests that program to create another program with the same functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-02/copyright-can-t-block-software-reverse-engineering-court.html|title=Copyright Can't Block Software Reverse Engineering: Court|last=White|first=Aoife|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== About ==

WPS can use programs written in the [[SAS language|language of SAS]] without the need for translating them into any other language. In this regard WPS is compatible with the SAS system. WPS is a language interpreter able to process the language of SAS and produce similar results.&lt;ref name="Your Apps – Language Support"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldprogramming.com/products/wps/your-apps/language-support|title=Your Apps – Language Support|accessdate=3 February 2012|publisher=World Programming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WPS is available to run on [[z/OS|Mainframe z/OS]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Linux]], Linux for Arm8 64-bit ([[AArch64]]), [[PowerLinux]], POWER/System p/pSeries (LE), [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[IBM AIX|AIX]] and [[Linux on zSeries|Linux on Mainframe System z]].&lt;ref name="Platforms – Summary"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldprogramming.com/products/wps/platforms|title=Platforms – Summary|accessdate=3 February 2012|publisher=World Programming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On all supported platforms, programs written in the language of SAS can be executed from a WPS command line interface, often referred to as running in batch mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldprogramming.com/products/wps/modules/interface/cli|title=Interface Module – WPS CLI|accessdate=3 February 2012|publisher=World Programming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WPS can also be used from a [[graphical user interface]] known as the '''WPS Workbench''' for managing, editing and running programs written in the language of SAS. The WPS Workbench user interface is based on [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]].&lt;ref name="Interface Module – WPS Workbench"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldprogramming.com/products/wps/modules/interface/workbench|title=Interface Module – WPS Workbench|accessdate=19 December 2016|publisher=World Programming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WPS version 4 (released in March 2018) introduced a drag-and-drop workflow canvas providing interactive blocks for data retrieval, blending and preparation, data discovery and profiling, predictive modelling powered by machine learning algorithms, model performance validation and scorecards.

WPS version 3 (released in February 2012) provides a new client/server architecture that allows the WPS Workbench GUI to execute SAS programs on remote server installations of WPS in a network or cloud. The resulting output, data sets, logs, etc., can then all be viewed and manipulated from inside the Workbench as if the workloads had been executed locally. SAS programs do not require any special language statements to use this feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldprogramming.com/products/wps/modules/interface/link|title=Interface Module – WPS Link|accessdate=3 February 2012|publisher=World Programming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 World Programming defended its use of the language of SAS in the High Court of England and Wales in ''[[SAS Institute Inc. v World Programming Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2010/1829.html|title=SAS Institute Inc v World Programming Ltd|accessdate=3 February 2012|date=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
