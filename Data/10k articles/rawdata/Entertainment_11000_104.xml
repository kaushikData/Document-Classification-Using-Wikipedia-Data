'''Allan Sherman''' (born '''Allan Copelon''';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjlmag.com/2013/11/hello-fadduh-comic-genius-allan.html]&lt;/ref&gt; November 30, 1924&amp;nbsp;– November 20, 1973) was an American [[comedy writer]], television producer, singer and actor who became famous as a song [[parody|parodist]] in the early 1960s. His first album, ''[[My Son, the Folk Singer]]'' (1962), became the fastest-selling record album up to that time.&lt;ref name=thomas62&gt;Thomas, Bob (Associated Press). "Fat and fortyish but star no less," ''Ottawa Herald'', December 13, 1962, page 10: ''"Warner Brothers Records report that it is the fastest-selling album in history, having sold 575,000 in six weeks. With the Christmas season coming up, it might push over a million."'' Retrieved 14 April 2016 via NewspaperArchive.com&lt;/ref&gt; His biggest hit single was "[[Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh (A Letter from Camp)|Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh]]", a comic novelty in which a boy describes his summer camp experiences to the tune of [[Amilcare Ponchielli|Ponchielli]]'s ''[[Dance of the Hours]]''.  He is not to be confused with the songwriter [[Al Sherman]], who, coincidentally, also died in the fall of 1973.

==Early life==
Sherman was born in Chicago, to Percy Copelon and Rose Sherman. Percy was an auto mechanic and race car driver who, like his son, suffered from obesity (he weighed over 350 pounds), and died while attempting a 100-day diet. His family was Jewish. Sherman's parents divorced when he was in grade school, and the son adopted his mother's maiden name. Due to his parents constantly moving to new residences, he attended over a dozen public schools in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, and Miami. He attended the [[University of Illinois]], where he earned mostly "C" grades and contributed a humor column to ''The Daily Illini'', the college newspaper, but never received a degree because he was expelled for breaking into a campus sorority house with his then-girlfriend.{{vague|date=July 2016|reason=Was it her sor. hse (e.g. to  conceal her being out  beyond a curfew? Was it a different sorority house, and if so w/ what motive? Also bcz inquiring minds want to know what penalty she incurred, and whether in his case "it wasn't the crime but the" attitude once caught}}{{citation needed|date=July 2016|reason=now do you get it, about the value of requiring refs???}}

==Television writer and producer==
Sherman devised a game show he intended to call ''I Know a Secret''. Television producer [[Mark Goodson]] used Sherman's idea and turned it into ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'', which ran on [[CBS]] from 1952 to 1967. Rather than paying him for the concept, Mark Goodson-[[Bill Todman]] Productions made Sherman the show's producer. Sherman was reported to be warm and kindhearted to all who worked for him. However, differences occurred between Sherman and anyone who was in a position to try to restrain his creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Goodson-Todman executive [[Gil Fates]] relates typical Sherman stunts in his memoir about ''[[What's My Line?]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; As producer of ''I've Got a Secret'', which was broadcast live, he showed a fondness for large-scale stunts that had the potential to teeter on the brink of disaster. He once released 100 rabbits onstage as an [[Easter]] surprise for the Madison Square [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys Club]], whose members were seated in the studio. The boys were invited to come up onstage to collect their prize. Although the resultant melee made a good story, it did not necessarily make for good TV.

The relationship between Goodson, Todman and Sherman became strained when he proposed that [[Tony Curtis]] teach the panel how to play some games he had played as a child growing up in New York City. However, Curtis had never actually played any of the games that Sherman had brought the props for. The props for Sherman's concept failed and the spot, which aired June 11, 1958, was a disaster and Sherman was removed as producer. Despite this, Goodson and Todman invited Sherman back several times as a guest on their shows in later years after he achieved celebrity status following the release of his albums.

Sherman also produced a short-lived 1954 game show, ''[[What's Going On (TV series)|What's Going On]]?'', which was technologically ambitious, with studio guests interacting with multiple live cameras in remote locations. In 1961, he produced a daytime game show for Al Singer Productions called ''Your Surprise Package'', which aired on CBS with host [[George Fenneman]].

==Song parodies==
In 1951, Sherman recorded a 78-rpm single with veteran singer Sylvia Froos which contained "A Satchel and a Seck", parodying "[[A Bushel and a Peck]]" from ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'', coupled with "Jake's Song", parodying "[[Sam's Song (song)|Sam's Song]]", a contemporary hit for [[Bing Crosby]] and his son [[Gary Crosby (actor)|Gary]]. The single sold poorly and when Sherman wrote his autobiography, he did not make reference to it. Later, he found that the song parodies he performed to amuse his friends and family were taking on a life of their own. Sherman lived in the [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California|Brentwood]] section of [[Westside (Los Angeles County)|West Los Angeles]] next door to [[Harpo Marx]], who invited him to perform his song parodies at parties attended by Marx's show-biz friends. After one party, [[George Burns]] phoned an executive at [[Warner Bros. Records]] and persuaded him to sign Sherman to a contract. The result was an [[Gramophone record|LP]] of these parodies, ''[[My Son, the Folk Singer]]'', which was released in 1962. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].&lt;ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"&gt;{{cite book

In 1962, capitalizing on his success, [[Jubilee Records]] re-released Sherman's 1951 single on the album ''More Folk Songs by Allan Sherman and His Friends'', which was a compilation of material by various [[Borscht Belt]] comedians, such as Sylvia Froos, [[Fyvush Finkel]] and Lee Tully, along with the Sherman material.

As suggested by the albums' titles, Sherman's first two LPs were mainly reworkings of old [[folk song]]s to infuse them with Jewish humor. His first minor hit was "Sarah Jackman" (pronounced "Jockman"), a takeoff of "[[Frère Jacques]]" in which he and a woman (Christine Nelson) exchange family gossip ("Sarah Jackman, Sarah Jackman,/How's by you? How's by you?/How's by you the family?/How's your sister Emily?" etc.). The popularity of "Sarah Jackman" (as well as the album ''My Son, the Folk Singer'') was enhanced after President [[John F. Kennedy]] was spotted in a hotel lobby singing the song. By his peak with ''[[My Son, the Nut]]'' in 1963, however, Sherman had broadened both his subject matter and his choice of [[parody]] material and begun to appeal to a larger audience.

Sherman wrote his parody lyrics in collaboration with [[Lou Busch]]. A few of the Sherman/Busch songs are completely original creations, featuring original music as well as lyrics, rather than new lyrics applied to an existing melody. The Sherman/Busch originals&amp;nbsp;– notably "Go to Sleep, Paul Revere" and "Peyton Place"&amp;nbsp;– are [[novelty song]]s, showing genuine melodic originality as well as deft lyrics.

However, Sherman had trouble in getting permission to record for profit from some well-known composers and lyricists, who did not tolerate parodies or satires of their melodies and lyrics, including [[Irving Berlin]], [[Richard Rodgers]], [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]], [[Meredith Willson]], [[Alan Jay Lerner]], and [[Frederick Loewe]], as well as the estates of [[Lorenz Hart]], [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Oscar Hammerstein]], [[Kurt Weill]], and [[Bertolt Brecht]], which prevented him from releasing parodies or satires of their songs. In the late 1950s, Sherman was inspired by a recording of a nightclub musical show called ''My Fairfax Lady'', a parody of ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' set in the Jewish section of Los Angeles that was performed at [[Billy Gray (comedian)|Billy Gray]]'s Band Box. Sherman then wrote his own song parodies of ''My Fair Lady'', which appeared as a [[bootleg recording]] in 1964, and were only officially released in 2005 on ''My Son, the Box''. Alan Jay Lerner did not approve of having the parody being performed; however, he reluctantly settled to allow the performances of "Fairfax Lady", on the strict conditions that the show could only be allowed to be performed inside the Fairfax Theater, without any touring company, and that the musical could not be videotaped or recorded for any album.

Although Sherman believed that all the songs parodied on ''My Son, the Folk Singer'' were in the [[public domain]], two of them, "Matilda" and "Water Boy"&amp;nbsp;– parodied as "My Zelda" and "[[Seltzer water|Seltzer]] Boy", respectively&amp;nbsp;– were actually under copyright, and Sherman was sued for copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, Allan. ''A Gift of Laughter'' and Wallace, Irving and Wallenchensky, David. ''The People's Almanac of the 20th Century''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963's ''My Son, the Nut'', Sherman's pointed parodies of classical and popular tunes dealt with [[automation]] in the workplace ("Automation", to the tune of "[[Fascination (1932 song)|Fascination]]"), [[Spaceflight|space travel]] ("Eight Foot Two, Solid Blue", to "[[Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue]]"), the exodus from the city to the suburbs ("Here's to the Crabgrass", to the tune of "English Country Garden"), and his own bulky contours ("Hail to Thee, Fat Person", which claims his [[obesity]] was a public service similar to the [[Marshall Plan]]). Six cartoon bears were printed on back of every album.

==A Top 40 hit==
One track from ''My Son, the Nut'', a spoof of [[summer camp]] entitled "[[Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh (A Letter from Camp)|Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh]]", became a surprise novelty hit, reaching No. 2 on the national [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for three weeks in late summer 1963. The lyrics were sung to the tune of one segment of [[Amilcare Ponchielli|Ponchielli]]'s ''[[Dance of the Hours]]'', familiar to the public because of its use in the [[Walt Disney]] film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''. That December, Sherman's "[[The Twelve Gifts of Christmas]]" single appeared on ''Billboard''{{'}}s separate Christmas chart. Sherman had one other Top 40 hit, a 1965 take-off on the [[Petula Clark]] hit "[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]" called "[[Crazy Downtown]]", which spent one week at #40. Two other Sherman singles charted in the lower regions of the ''Billboard'' 100: an updated "Hello Mudduh, Hello Fadduh" (#59 in 1964), and "The Drinking Man's Diet" (#98 in 1965). Sherman's "The End of a Symphony", spotlighting [[Arthur Fiedler]]'s [[Boston Pops Orchestra]], reached #113 on the "Bubbling Under" chart in 1964, but did not make the Hot 100.

The songs on Sherman's next album ''My Name Is Allan'' (1965) were thematically connected: except for a couple of original novelty songs with music by Sherman and Busch, all the songs on the album are parodies of songs that had won, or were nominated for, the [[Academy Award for Best Song]]. They included "[[That Old Black Magic]]", "[[Secret Love (Doris Day song)|Secret Love]]", "[[The Continental (song)|The Continental]]", "[[Chim Chim Cher-ee]]" and "[[Call Me Irresponsible]]".  The cover of the album bore a childhood photograph of Sherman. That, and the album's title, were references to [[Barbra Streisand]]'s album ''[[My Name Is Barbra]]'', released earlier that year, which featured a cover photograph of the singer as a young girl.

During his brief heyday, Sherman's parodies were so popular that he had at least one contemporary imitator: ''My Son the Copycat'' was an album of song parodies performed by [[Stanley Ralph Ross]], co-written by Ross and [[Bob Arbogast]]. Lest there be any doubt of whom Ross is copying, his album's cover bears a crossed-out photo of Sherman. One of the songs on this album is a fat man's lament, "I'm Called Little Butterball", parodying "I'm Called Little Buttercup" from [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s [[operetta]] ''[[HMS Pinafore]]''. Sherman would later parody this same song as "Little Butterball"&amp;nbsp;– with the same subject matter&amp;nbsp;– on his album ''[[Allan in Wonderland]]''. The song may have had more poignancy for Sherman, as he, unlike Stanley Ross, was genuinely overweight. Sherman also parodied Gilbert and Sullivan's "Titwillow" from ''[[The Mikado]]'', in the song "The Bronx Bird-Watcher" (on ''My Son, the Celebrity''), as well as [[Cultural influence of Gilbert and Sullivan|several other Gilbert and Sullivan songs]].

==Later work==
In 1965, Sherman published an autobiography, ''A Gift of Laughter'', and, for a short period at least, he was culturally ubiquitous. He sang on and guest-hosted ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'', was involved in the production of [[Bill Cosby]]'s first three albums, appeared in the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]], and sang "The Dropouts' March" on the March 6, 1964, edition of the [[NBC]] satirical program ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]''.

Also in 1964, Sherman narrated his own version of [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'' in a live concert at [[Tanglewood]] with the [[Boston Pops]] under [[Arthur Fiedler]]. The concert, which was released as the album ''Peter and the Commissar'', also included "Variations on '[[How Dry I Am]]'", with Sherman as [[Conductor (music)|conductor]], and "The End of a Symphony". In "Variations", Fiedler was the guest soloist, providing solo hiccups. In 2004, [[Collector's Choice Music|Collector's Choice]] reissued the complete [[RCA Victor]] album on CD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Commissar-Arthur-Fiedler-Boston-Sherman/dp/B0002LO7GU |title=Peter &amp; The Commissar: Arthur Fiedler &amp; The Boston Pops With Allan Sherman: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sherman's later albums grew more pointedly satirical and less light-hearted, skewering protesting students ("The Rebel"), consumer debt ("A Waste of Money", based on "[[A Taste of Honey (song)|A Taste of Honey]]"), and the [[generation gap]] ("Crazy Downtown" and "Pop Hates [[the Beatles]]").

Sherman was often tapped to produce specialty song parodies for corporations. An album of six paper-cup and vending machine related songs, titled ''Music to Dispense With'', was created for the Container Division of the [[Scott Paper Company]] for distribution to its vendors and customers. It consisted of the tracks "Makin' Coffee" (a parody of "[[Makin' Whoopee]]"), "Vending Machines", "There Are Cups", "That's How the Change Is Made", "The Wonderful Tree in the Forest" and "Scott Cups".&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmdb.org/discographies/sherman.disco.html#scott|title=Music To Dispense With Created By Allan Sherman For The Container Division Of Scott Paper Company|last=Morris|first=Jeff|date=November 21, 2005|work=The [[Dr Demento|Demented]] Music Database!|accessdate=January 6, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100105060643/http://dmdb.org/discographies/sherman.disco.html| archivedate= January 5, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sherman also created a group of eight "public education" radio spots for Encron carpet fibers, singing their praises to the tunes of old public-domain songs. Entitled ''Allan Sherman Pours It On for Carpets Made with Encron Polyester'', it featured an introduction by Sherman and comprised the tracks "Encron Is a Brand New Fiber" (to the tune of "[[Shine On, Harvest Moon]]"), "Put Them All Together, They Spell Encron" (to the tune of [[Eddy Arnold]]'s "M-O-T-H-E-R"), "There's a Fiber Called Encron" (to the tune of William H. Hill's "[[There is a Tavern in the Town]]"), "Encron Alive, Alive-O" (to the tune of "[[Molly Malone]]"), "Encron's the Name", "Why They Call It Encron" (to the tune of "[[Let Me Call You Sweetheart]]"), "Encron, Encron" (to the tune of "[[Daisy Bell]]") and "Encron Is a Great New Fiber" (to the tune of "Take Me to the Fair").&lt;ref name="encron"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmdb.org/discographies/sherman.disco.html#encron|title=Allan Sherman Pours It On For Carpets Made With Encron Polyester|last=Morris|first=Jeff|date=November 21, 2005|work=The [[Dr Demento|Demented]] Music Database!|accessdate=January 6, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100105060643/http://dmdb.org/discographies/sherman.disco.html| archivedate= January 5, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
Sherman's career success was short-lived: after peaking in 1963, his popularity declined rather quickly. After the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], impersonator [[Vaughn Meader]] vowed to never again do a Kennedy impression, and perhaps because of this ominous shadow&amp;nbsp;– Meader was a very popular parody impressionist of the day&amp;nbsp;– and the resulting reluctance to book such acts, the public saw less of Sherman's type of comedy.&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petabit.com/steve/LATimes_Granada.html |title=Los Angeles Times: The Boy in Camp Granada |publisher=Petabit.com |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312051035/http://www.petabit.com/steve/LATimes_Granada.html |archive-date=March 12, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1964, Sherman was among many American acts whose sales were affected badly  by the [[British Invasion]] (which, in fair measure, Sherman skewered in the song "Pop Hates the Beatles", a spoof of "[[Pop! Goes the Weasel]]").

By 1965, he had released two albums that did not make the Top 50 and in 1966 [[Warner Bros.]] dropped him from the label. His last album for the company, ''Togetherness'', was released in 1967 to poor reviews and poorer sales. All of his previous releases had been recorded in front of a live studio audience&amp;nbsp;– or in the case of ''Live, Hoping You Are the Same'', recorded during a Las Vegas performance&amp;nbsp;– but ''Togetherness'' was not, and the lack of an audience and their response affected the result, as did the nondescript backup singers and studio orchestra.

On November 13, 1965 Sherman made a rare prime time television acting appearance in "The Sheriff of Fetterman's Crossing," an episode of [[Rod Serling|Rod Serling's]] short-lived Western series ''[[The Loner]]'' (1965–66). Sherman played Walton Peterson Tetley, a local schnook who went off to war and rose to regiment cook before returning home a hero thanks to tall tales and yarn-spinning. The town hails its conquering hero and Tetley is appointed sheriff. Series star [[Lloyd Bridges]] as William Colton, a wandering Union veteran, comes to town and signs on to be Tetley's deputy, discovering quickly his boss' utter incompetence in the office. Tetley receives a threatening note from a gunslinger challenging this purported hero to a gunfight when he arrives on the noon stage, at which point the story becomes a parody of iconic Western movie ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952). Colton sets to teaching the shivering-in-his-boots sheriff courage and gunmanship. Sherman's semi-serious and sympathetic performance was strong and his presence an affable one.

In 1966, Sherman visited Australia. He did a television series in Melbourne, Victoria, for a live audience. During the performance, he sang a parody of "Molly Malone." It included a play on the word "but" (butt) which did not elicit a laugh. What Sherman did not know is that Australians use the word "bum" where Americans would say "butt" (although usage of the word "butt" has since become widespread in Australia). Otherwise, Sherman was well received by the audience. Afterward, he met with some of his fans and signed at least one autograph.

In 1969, Sherman wrote the book and lyrics&amp;nbsp;– with music by [[Albert Hague]]&amp;nbsp;– for ''[[The Fig Leaves Are Falling]]'', a flop [[Broadway theater|Broadway musical]] that ran only four performances, despite direction by [[George Abbott]] and a cast that included [[Barry Nelson]], [[Dorothy Loudon]], and [[David Cassidy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=3446 |title=The official source for Broadway Information |publisher=IBDB |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Still creative, in 1973, Sherman published the controversial ''[[The Rape of the A*P*E*]]'', which detailed his point of view on American [[Religious fanaticism|Puritanism]] and the [[sexual revolution]].

In 1971, Sherman was the voice of [[Dr. Seuss]]'s ''[[The Cat in the Hat]]''  for the animated [[The Cat in the Hat (TV special)|television special]]. He reprised the role for ''[[Dr. Seuss on the Loose]]'', his last project before his death.

==Death==
In his final years, Sherman's alcoholism and weight gain caused severe deterioration of his health; he later developed [[diabetes]] and struggled with [[lung disease]].&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jangle04.home.mindspring.com/sherman3.html |title=Allan Sherman: Hail to Thee, Fat Person - by David Holzel - page 3 |publisher=Jangle04.home.mindspring.com |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, his wife Dee filed for divorce&lt;ref name=offing&gt;(Editor's note.)

'' Retrieved 14 April 2016 via NewspaperArchive.com.&lt;/ref&gt; and received full custody of their son and daughter.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Sherman lived on unemployment benefits for a time and moved into the [[Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital]] for a short time to lose weight.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; He died of [[emphysema]] at his home in West Hollywood at age 48. He is entombed in [[Culver City, California]]'s [[Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|2367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Sherman was the inspiration for a new generation of developing parodists such as [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], who pays homage to Sherman on the cover of [["Weird Al" Yankovic (album)|his first LP]]. Sherman's hit song "Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh" has been translated into other languages. In one notable example, the Dutch-Swedish poet [[Cornelis Vreeswijk]] translated the song loosely into Swedish as "Brev från kolonien" (Letter from Summer Camp), which reached fourth on the Swedish popular music chart Svensktoppen in the summer of 1965&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sr.se/Diverse/AppData/Isidor/files/2023/3463.txt |title=SVENSKTOPPEN: Date: 1965-01-02 |publisher=Sr.se |accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still popular in Sweden today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lyricsplayground.com/alpha/songs/b/brevfrankolonien.shtml |title=BREV FRAN KOLONIEN - Lyrics - International Lyrics Playground |publisher=Lyricsplayground.com |date=October 10, 2007 |accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Best of Allan Sherman'' CD was released in 1990, and a [[boxed set]] of most of his songs was released in 2005 under the title ''My Son, the Box''. In 1992 a [[musical revue]] of his songs titled ''Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah'' ran for over a year [[off-off-Broadway]]; other productions ran [[Off-Broadway]] for four months in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lortel.org/LLA_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&amp;id=106 |title=Lortel Archives-The Internet Off-Broadway Database |publisher=Lortel.org |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006184127/http://www.lortel.org/LLA_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&amp;id=106 |archive-date=October 6, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and toured in 2003. A children's book based on the song "Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh", with illustrations by [[Syd Hoff]], was published in 2004.

On March 14, 2006, [[National Public Radio]] profiled Sherman on ''All Things Considered''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sherman |first=Allan |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5279983 |title=Allan Sherman: Beyond 'Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh' |publisher=NPR |date=March 14, 2006 |accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, eight of Allan Sherman's Warner Bros. albums were individually released on CD:
*''[[My Son, the Folk Singer]]''
*''[[My Son, the Celebrity]]''
*''[[My Son, the Nut]]''
*''[[Allan in Wonderland]]''
*''[[For Swingin' Livers Only!]]''
*''My Name Is Allan''
*''Allan Sherman: Live! (Hoping You Are the Same)''
*''Togetherness''

Sherman's son, Robert, later became a [[game show]] producer, producing for Mark Goodson during the 1970s and 1980s, including ''[[Password Plus]]'', ''[[Blockbusters (U.S. game show)|Blockbusters]]'', ''[[Body Language (game show)|Body Language]]'' and ''[[Super Password]]''.

==In popular culture==
* Sherman's song "Ratt Fink" was covered by punk rock band [[Misfits (band)|The Misfits]] on their 1979 single "[[Night of the Living Dead]]". It was also covered by Ex-[[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] guitarist [[Bobby Steele]] by his band [[The Undead]]. Sherman wrote the song as a parody of "[[Rag Mop]]," originally performed by [[Johnnie Lee Wills]] and popularized by [[The Ames Brothers]] in 1950.
* In the "[[Three Gays of the Condo]]" episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] makes a guest appearance. When Homer asks Yankovic if he got the two songs he recorded and sent in, Yankovic replies that he did. When Homer asks which he liked better, Yankovic replies, "They were pretty much the same, Homer." Homer then mutters angrily, "Yeah, like you and Allan Sherman."  Other references to Sherman came in the episode "[[Marge Be Not Proud]]" when Bart hides an answering machine tape in a copy of his (fictitious) ''Camp Granada'' album&amp;nbsp;– "where no one would ever listen to it," and in "[[A Midsummer's Nice Dream]]" where Homer shows Bart and Lisa his copy of another fictional Sherman album, ''[[Helter Skelter (Manson scenario)|Helter Shmelter]]: Sorry For the Mess''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://simpsonswiki.net/wiki/Allan_Sherman%27s_Helter_Shmelter_-_Sorry_For_the_Mess |title=Allan Sherman's Helter Shmelter - Sorry For the Mess - Wikisimpsons, the Simpsons Wiki |publisher=Simpsonswiki.net |date=August 13, 2012 |accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The group [[Capitol Steps]] used "Hello Mullah, Hello Faddah" as a parody in ''Fools On The Hill (Songs of 1992)''.
*Dutch comedian [[Rijk de Gooyer]] sang two Dutch versions of "Hello Mulla, Hello Faddah" named "Brief uit La Courtine"(Letter from La Courtine") and "Brief naar La Courtine" (Letter to La Courtine). In the first one, he describes his adventures as a soldier in the Dutch base at [[La Courtine]], and in the second, his father replies to the first letter.

'''''Apostrophes: A Book of Tributes to Masters of Music''''' is a [[book]] written by [[Alfred Kreymborg]] and published by The Grafton Press, New York, in 1910.  It is a slim volume (with no page numbers), and comprises a series of short somewhat 'poetic' paragraphs addressed to various great composers.  There is an introductory apostrophe ''To Music'', and then sections on the following composers: [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Richard Wagner]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Robert Franz]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Georges Bizet]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Antonín Dvořák]], [[Edvard Grieg]], [[Vincent d'Indy]], [[Edward MacDowell]], [[Claude Debussy]], and [[Richard Strauss]].

In his autobiography, ''[[Troubador: An American Autobiography|Troubador]],'' he describes how he came to write the book; he refers to himself in the third person: "He actually dreamed of writing books of his own and carried the desire to the point of struggling, almost at the outset, with a humble work on the four huge symphonies of Brahms. In retrospect, it looked like a few drops of ink in the sea and he destroyed it. Then he tried the other extreme and evolved a series of paragraphs, concise, restrained and reverent.  These prose poems to composers, moving from Palestrina to Debussy, he entitled ''Apostrophes.''"{{ref|troubadorQuote}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2654">'''Brelan''' (O. Fr. ''brelenc'', hence a name for a card player, gambler or the name of the place where the game was played.&lt;ref&gt;Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, published 1913 by C. &amp; G. Merriam Co.&lt;/ref&gt;), is a famous French vying game with rapidly escalating bets from the seventeenth to nineteenth century. The game is quite similar to the game of [[Bouillotte]], but it is not played anymore.

==History==
The game of Brelan, even ''breland'' for the name and the rules varied over time, also appears in an edict of [[Lille]], [[France]], of 1458. Crébillon's 1763 novel Le Hasard du coin du feu,the game of "Brelan" takes center stage. It is often considered as sharing roots with a Renaissance game of [[Primero]] and [[Primo visto]].

In England, Brelan eventually developed into the game of [[Three card brag|Brag]], also Bragg, where the possibility of bluffing is an important part of the game. It evidently derived from the game of Brelan and later evolved into [[Bouillotte]], which flourished during the French Revolution. Most experts believe that all these earlier card games played an important part in the formation of modern [[Poker]], the most famous representative of a very ancient and always very popular family of games, all of which can be traced even further back to the old French game of [[Gilet_(card game)|Gilet]] (''Gillet'', ''Gile''  or ''Trionfetti''),&lt;ref&gt;Schaum's outline of French vocabulary, pg. 322 Mary E. Coffman Crocker 1997&lt;/ref&gt; which may be considered the most ancient European ancestor of Poker.

==The game==
Brelan is played by three, four or five players, with a 32-card pack,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Card Games, David Parlett, pg. 37 {{ISBN|0-19-869173-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; each receiving 3 cards and a fourth turned from the stock. The best hand is a ''brelan carre'', or four of a kind, made with the aid of the turn-up card on the table, followed by a simple brelan or prial. Brelan favori is a pair royal composed of 2 cards in the hand and the card turned.

In Brelan Cavé,&lt;ref&gt;Académie universelle des jeux, ou, Dictionnaire méthodique et raisonné de jeu, pg. 57 Charles Yves Cousin d'Avallon, 3rd. ed. 1842&lt;/ref&gt; the game is limited to a certain number of rounds, the bouillotte, on the contrary, lasts as long as there are players in the game and who still haven't lost their stakes.

'''CPN Radio''' ({{lang-es|Cadena Peruana de Noticias}}) was a [[Peru]]vian radio broadcaster with national coverage in Peru. It was founded in 1996. Early in the decade of 2000 was the main competitor of [[Radio Programas del Perú|RPP]] (Radio Programas del Perú), but declined at the end of the decade. Finally, because of economic problems radio ownership changed, but failed to get solvent. Following those circumstances was forced to stop broadcasting in 2011 and was replaced by a romantic music station.

The '''''canzona''''' (It. plural '''''canzone''''') is an instrumental musical form of the 16th and 17th centuries that developed from the Netherlandish [[chanson]] {{harv|Caldwell|2001}}. It differed from the similar forms of [[ricercare]] and [[Fantasia (music)|fantasia]] in its livelier, markedly rhythmic material and separation into distinct sections {{harv|Grout|1960|loc=299}}.

At first based on Franco-Flemish [[polyphonic]] songs (chansons), later independently composed, the instrumental canzonas, such as the brass canzonas of [[Giovanni Gabrieli]] and the keyboard canzonas of [[Girolamo Frescobaldi]], influenced the [[fugue]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} and the ensemble canzonas were the direct ancestors of the 17th-century ''[[sonata da chiesa]]'' {{harv|Grout|1960|loc=252}}. In Italian, ''canzona'' literally means "song".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3397">'''Childlore''' is the [[folklore]] or folk culture of [[children]] and young people. It includes, for example, [[rhyme]]s and games played in the school playground. The best known researchers of the field were [[Peter and Iona Opie]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The subject matter of childlore includes the traditions of children between the ages of about 6 and 15 such as games, [[riddles]], rhymes, jokes, pranks, [[superstition]]s, magical practices, [[wit]], [[lyrics]], [[Wiktionary:guile#Etymology|guile]], [[wiktionary:epithets|epithets]], nicknames, torments, [[parody]], oral legislation, seasonal customs, tortures, obscenities, codes, etc.&lt;ref name="Sutton"&gt;[[Brian Sutton-Smith|Sutton-Smith]] 1970:1–8.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as individual activities such as solitary play, [[daydream]]ing, fantasies, imaginary companions and heroes, collections, scrapbooks, model worlds, comic reading, mass media interests, dramatizations, stories, art, etc.&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt; 

As a branch of folklore, childlore is concerned with those activities which are learned and passed on by children to other children. The stories and games taught by adults to children are not considered childlore except insofar as the children adapt and make them their own. In western culture most folklorists are concerned with children after they join their peers in elementary school or kindergarten. The traditions of childhood generally stop after the child enters intermediate school, which coincides with puberty and adolescence.&lt;ref name="Grider"&gt;Grider 1980:159–160&lt;/ref&gt;

Opie and Opie demonstrate that the culture of children is quite distinctive and is as unnoticed by the sophisticated world, and quite as little affected by it.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Opie stated that the words of one game ([[Buck buck]]) had survived from the time of [[Nero]].&lt;ref name="Opie"&gt;Opie: 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The conservatism of childlore contrasts with the way adult folklore is rapidly modified to fit changing circumstances.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

A '''costume designer''' is a person who designs [[costume]]s for a [[film]], [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] production or television. The role of the costume designer is to create the characters' outfits/costumes and balance the scenes with texture and colour, etc.&lt;ref name="Landis"&gt;{{cite book | title=Filmcraft: Costume Design: Costume Design | publisher=Elsevier Science | author=Landis, Deborah Nadoolman | date=2012-03-16 | pages=Introduction | isbn=9780240818672}}&lt;/ref&gt; The costume designer works alongside the [[Theatre director|director]], [[scenic design|scenic]], [[lighting designer]], sound designer, and other creative personnel. The costume designer may also collaborate with hair stylist, wig master, or makeup artist. In European theatre, the role is different, as the theatre designer usually designs both costume and scenic elements.

Designers typically  seek to enhance a character's personality, and to create an evolving plot of colour, changing social status, or period through the visual design of garments and accessories. They may distort or enhance the body—within the boundaries of the director's vision. The designer must ensure that the designs let the actor move as the role requires. The actor must execute the director's blocking of the production without damaging the garments. Garments must be durable and washable, especially for plays with extended runs or films with near-[[Real time (media)|real time]] [[Pace (speed)|pacing]] (meaning that most costumes will not change between scenes) but whose [[principal photography]] phase may stretch across several weeks. The designer must consult not only with the director, but the set and lighting designers to ensure that all elements of the overall production design work together. The designer must possess strong artistic capabilities and a thorough knowledge of pattern development, draping, drafting, textiles and fashion history. The designer must understand historical costuming, and the movement style and poise that period dress may require. 

==History==
{{Expand section|date=May 2016}}

During the late-19th century, [[Theatrical company management|company managers]] in the US usually selected costumes for a show. Many were pulled from a rental house; few were designed. Though designers in other theatrical disciplines were recognized, few who specialized in costumes were. The few that were included [[Caroline Siedle]], [[William Charles John Pitcher|C. Wilhelm]], [[Percy Anderson]], and Mrs. John Alexander. They sometimes even received credit on the title page of a [[Programme (booklet)|playbill]] rather than in the back.&lt;ref&gt;King, Kimball. ''Western Drama through the Ages: A Student Reference Guide''. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2007. 534. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, film costume designers like [[Edith Head]] and [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]] became well known. Later, those working in television like [[Nolan Miller]] (''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''), [[Janie Bryant]] (''[[Mad Men]]''), and [[Patricia Field]] (''[[Sex and the City]]'') became more prominent, some becoming authors and having their own clothing and jewelry lines.&lt;ref name="meltzer20130919"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/fashion/costume-designers-for-tv-have-a-big-impact-on-fashion.html |title=Get Me Wardrobe! |last=Meltzer |first=Marisa |date=2013-09-19 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of costume designers==
{{Costume}}

Professional costume designers generally fall into three types: freelance, residential, and academic.

*Freelance designers are hired for a specific production by a theatre, dance or opera company, and may or may not actually be local to the theatre they design for.  A freelancer is traditionally paid in three instalments: Upon hire, on delivery of final renderings, and opening night of the production.  Freelancers are not obligated to any exclusivity in what projects they work on, and may design for several productions concurrently.
*A residential designer is hired by a specific theatre, dance or opera company for an extended series of productions.  This can be as short as a summer stock contract, or may be for many years.  A residential designer's contract may limit the amounts of freelance work they are allowed to accept.  Unlike the freelancer, a residential designer is consistently "on location" at the theater—at hand to work with costume studio and other collaborators.  Residential designers tend to be more established than strict freelancers, but this is not always the case.
*An academic designer is one who holds professorship at a school.  The designer is primarily an instructor, but may also act as a residential designer to varying degrees.  They are often free to freelance, as their schedule allows.  In the past, professors of costume design were mostly experienced professionals that may or may not have had formal post-graduate education, but it has now become increasingly common to require a professor to have at least a [[Master of Fine Arts]] in order to teach.

Both residential and academic designers are generally also required to act as Shop Master or Mistress of an onsite costume shop, in addition to designing productions. In a resident theatre, there is almost always a shop staff of stitchers, drapers, cutters and craft artisans. In an academic environment the shop "staff" is generally students, who are learning about costume design and construction. Most universities require costume design students to work a specified number of hours in the shop as part of their course work.

==Unions==
There are two unions that costume designers can belong to:

Costume Designers Guild, Local 892 is one union that represents Costume Designers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.CostumeDesignersGuild.com]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] and [[United Scenic Artists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usa829.org/ Local 829] usa829.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Many costumers belong to the Motion Picture Costumers Union, Local 705 and represent every position within the costume department (except the costume designer).  Local 705 represents Costume Supervisors, Key Costumers, Costumers, Tailor/Seamstress, Ager/Dyer, Cutter/Fitters, Costume House Employees and Commercial Costumers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motionpicturecostumers.org/local705/ Local 705] motionpicturecostumers.org&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dinner and a Movie''''' is an American cooking and entertainment television program aired on [[TBS Superstation|TBS]] from [[1995 in television|1995]] to [[2011 in television|2011]].

Each episode included a movie and the preparation of a creative dinner to go with its theme, generally via a [[pun]]. For example, an episode showing ''[[Drumline (movie)|Drumline]]'' features a recipe titled "The Beets Go On", referencing the [[Sonny &amp; Cher]] single "[[The Beat Goes On (Sonny &amp; Cher song)|The Beat Goes On]]", as well as the plot of the movie about a drummer who tries to fit in with a new [[marching band]].

The show was hosted by chef [[Claud Mann]] and comedian [[Paul Gilmartin]] throughout its run, as well as [[Annabelle Gurwitch]] from 1996–2002, [[Lisa Arch|Lisa Kushell]] from 2002–2005 and [[Janet Varney]] from 2005 to the show's end in 2011.

 |ShortSummary    = June 2, 2013 – Thom learns that Jeremy bought prints of Cal's photos of Thom. Kathy forgives Cal for treating her terribly the previous night. Thom is upset about the prints. Jeremy decides that this is not what he wants and ends the relationship. Kathy tells Ian that she likes him and apologizes for being self-absorbed. Because she feels so much, she tends to forget that other people feel things too and wants to know what Ian feels. He admits that he misses her and that he still feels angry when he sees her. They agree that, even though he agreed with her decision, she should have told him before getting the abortion. They also agree to be more open. Cal and Thom apologize to one another. They both admit that they still love another and that they are scared for their future.

== Reception ==
After the release of the first two episodes, ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' described the series as "charming, sharply written, and well-acted," specifically praising Guarino and Wu, and felt that the future of the series was "promising."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/eastsiders-youtube-web-series/|title = "Eastsiders": Gay dark comedy finds audience on YouTube|date = January 14, 2013|accessdate = May 10, 2015|website = |publisher = [[The Daily Dot]]|last = Valinsky|first = Jordan}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Next Magazine (New York City)|''Next Magazine'']] also felt that the first two episodes were "top-notch", especially as it noted "the demographic [depicting the lives of young gay men] is still pretty unrepresented when it comes to well-produced series," and included the first season Kickstarter among those it recommended for backing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nextmagazine.com/content/crowd-sourced-full-season-eastsiders-reflecting-legacy-james-booker|title = Crowd Sourced: A full season of EastSiders // Reflecting on the legacy of James Booker|date = January 9, 2013|accessdate = May 10, 2015|website = |publisher = [[Next Magazine (New York City)|Next Magazine]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IndieWire]] recommended the series, because it was "giving Logo the kind of soap opera they should have on-air."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.indiewire.com/article/critics-picks-2013s-six-drama-web-series-you-must-see-including-the-years-best|title = Critic's Picks: 2013's Six Drama Web Series You Must See, Including the Year's Best|date = December 20, 2013|accessdate = May 10, 2015|website = |publisher = [[IndieWire]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[NewMediaRockstars]]'' felt that the first season was met positively because fans "were eager for a quality series that portrayed realistic LGBT relationships without making sexual orientation the characters’ defining feature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://newmediarockstars.com/2015/04/eastsiders-season-2-preview-surprising-twists-ahead-for-acclaimed-lgbt-web-series/|title = EastSiders Season 2 Preview: Surprising Twists Ahead For Acclaimed LGBT Web Series|date = April 3, 2015|accessdate = May 10, 2015|website = |publisher = [[NewMediaRockstars]]|last = Linnell|first = Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edwin Pearce Christy''' (November 28, 1815 – May 21, 1862) was an American composer, singer, actor and stage producer. He is more commonly known as '''E. P. Christy''', and was the founder of the [[blackface]] [[minstrel show|minstrel]] group [[Christy's Minstrels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=The Millionaire Negro-Singer |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1857/01/09/77068810.pdf |quote=... having made a princely fortune out of burnt cork and Ethiopian melodies now lives the life of a wealthy and fashionable New-Yorker. ... His wealth is prodigious, and, as he has been economical and laborious while earning it, he feels authorized to spend it freely. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 9, 1857 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born on November 28, 1815 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] to Robert F. Christy and Ruth Wheaton.&lt;ref name=archive/&gt;

Christy began his career as a [[minstrel]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]. By 1836 he was a member of the Company managed by Edwin Dean at the Eagle Street Theater in Buffalo.&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo Courier July 8, 1894 p. 18; Buffalo Courier July 29, 1917&lt;/ref&gt; He toured upstate New York from 1843 to 1845. The group took the name of its founder and became known as the [[Christy's Minstrels]]. In April 1846 Christy and his band of six performers began performing in [[New York City]] at [[Polmer's Opera House]]. The group performed at [[Mechanics' Hall, New York City|Mechanics Hall]] from February 15, 1847 to July 15, 1854. After performing at a benefit performance for [[Stephen Foster]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], on August 25, 1847, the group specialized in performances of Foster's works. Foster sold his song, ''Old Folks at Home'', to Christy for his exclusive use.&lt;ref name=archive&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/rbm/keffer/christy.html |title=Edwin Pearce Christy archive |date= |accessdate=2016-12-15 |quote= |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christy retired as a performer in 1855.&lt;ref name=archive/&gt;

He operated a chain of theaters called [[Christy's Opera Houses]] in several cities. The name of the original group, Christy's Minstrels, was licensed for use by a new organization and became synonymous with the performance tradition of blackface minstrelsy.&lt;ref name=archive/&gt;

Fearful of financial reverses due to the upheaval of the [[American Civil War]], Christy committed suicide by throwing himself from a window in his home at 78 East Eighteenth-street in [[Manhattan, New York City]] on May 20, 1862.&lt;ref name=archive/&gt; He died on May 21, 1862 of his injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=The Death Of E. P. Christy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/22/news/the-death-of-ep-christy.html |quote= |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 22, 1862 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was buried in [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]].

'''Harold''' is a structure used in longform [[improvisational theatre]]. Developed by [[Del Close]] and brought to fruition through Close's collaboration with [[Charna Halpern]], the Harold has become the signature form of Chicago's [[iO Theater]] and the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]]. It is now performed by improv troupes and teams across the world.
[[The Committee (improv group)|The Committee]], a [[San Francisco]] improv group, performed the first Harold in [[Concord, California]], in 1967.&lt;ref name="Funniest"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Funniest One in the Room: The Lives and Legends of Del Close|author=Kim "Howard" Johnson|year=2008|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=978-1-55652-712-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were invited to a high school and decided to do their improvisations on the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]]. On the way home in a [[Volkswagen Type 2 (T1)|Volkswagen bus]], they were discussing the performance, when one of them asked what they should call it. Allaudin (Bill) Mathieu called out "Harold",&lt;ref name="Funniest"/&gt; which was a joking reference to a line from ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' where a reporter asks [[George Harrison]] what he calls his haircut and he answers "Arthur".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=George P. Garrett |editor2=O. B. Hardison, Jr. |editor3=Jane R. Gelfman  |date=2013 |title=Film Scripts (Book 4): A Hard Day's Night, The Best Man, Darling - Classic Screenplays |url=https://www.amazon.com/Film-Scripts-Four-Darling-Screenplays/dp/1480342068/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1525849895 |publisher=Applause Theatre and Cinema Books |page=Scene 39 (Ballroom - Press Conference) |isbn=978-1480342064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close later remarked that he wished he had chosen a better name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.improvcomedy.org/hall/close.html|title=Del Close|accessdate=2007-10-09|publisher=ImprovComedy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When The Committee disbanded in 1972, improv company Improvisation, Inc. was the only company in America continuing to perform Close's "original" Harold: a 45-minute free-form piece that would seamlessly move from one "Harold technique" to another. In 1976, two former I-Inc performers, Michael Bossier and John Elk, formed Spaghetti Jam, performing in San Francisco's [[The Old Spaghetti Factory]] through 1983. Spaghetti Jam performed Harolds while also turning [[Viola Spolin|Spolin]] games and Harold techniques into stand-alone performance pieces (i.e., shortform improv).

Close and Halpern's 1994 book ''Truth in Comedy''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Truth in Comedy|author1=Charna Halpern |author2=Del Close |author3=Kim Johnson |year=1994|isbn=978-1-56608-003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the definitive text on the form. It describes a "training wheels Harold" as three acts (or "beats"), each with three scenes and a group segment. With each beat, the three scenes return. By the end of the piece, the three scenes have converged.

==Structure==

A typical Harold is 25 to 40 minutes. Given three unrelated scenes A, B, and C, the structure follows:

* '''Opening'''
* '''Scenes''' A1, B1, C1
* '''Group Game'''
* '''Scenes''' A2, B2, C2
* '''Group Game'''
* '''Scenes''' A3, B3, C3 (Note: In the final set of scenes, not all three will always return. Players are encouraged to call back the most interesting scenes and characters from the Harold, and also to intertwine them.)

Close called this a 3x3 structure, using it to give improvisers a sense of organization to help them through their first Harolds. He was clear that the format was theirs to use. Departures were not only allowed but were considered important steps in developing a group's ability to Harold. He expressed this in ''Truth in Comedy'', noting that "the first rule is: there are no rules." In performing Harolds, content and the need to develop an organic commentary on the suggestion trump predetermined structures.

Various Harold structures use different sets of guidelines such as the 3x3 format. Another guideline might be whether players stay as the first character they create or can play multiple characters, or that the ending is a group scene. Yet another guideline could be that everyone knows each other and scene partnerships may change from the first to second and second to third layers.

The loose structure allows for the creative bursts necessary for the Harold. Using an audience suggestion, players explore their relationship to the topic as a starting point. The scenes progressively evolve as the exploration continues to an ending point.

==Opening==

The basic form starts with an "opening". After eliciting the audience's suggestion, the ensemble explores it for a few minutes in either an unplanned or a predetermined structure. Textbook structures include:

* A cocktail party that ebbs and flows between conversations.
* Monologues that rotate among cast members.
* Invocation of the suggestion in the style of an occult ritual (It is, you are, thou art, I am).
* Organic involving morphing sound and movement exploration.
* Pattern game where word association is used to generate ideas, often referred to as a clover leaf because the pattern arcs out with associated words and returns to the suggestion a total of three times, like the three leaves of a clover.
* Source scene or scenes which are used to pull ideas and which might return in the third beat.

Rarely is the opening just about the literal suggestion. The suggestion serves a starting point to discover greater underlying themes. Close stated that a suggestion should be elevated from the commonplace to the extraordinary.

==First beat (A1, B1, C1)==

Following the opening are three completely unrelated two-person scenes. Each may use such information from the opening as:

* Details, such as location
* Themes and patterns, such as troubled family life
* Tangential information, such as a [[throwaway line]]

As the suggestion inspires the opening, the opening is a launching point for the first set of scenes.

==Group game==

Following the third scene, multiple members of the cast return to stage, for a group game based on the opening. A group game is a palate cleanser and should not relate to the established sets of scenes.

In a scenic group game, the focus jumps between all the characters participating. A textbook structure is the Advertising Meeting, where the entire cast must come up with an ad campaign for a new product.

More abstract group games are called presentational, which focus less on individual characters and more on a concept; for example, in "slide show", one improviser presents slides that are recreated by the rest of the troupe. Some other examples of presentational group games are

* Flocking – all the improvisers mirror each other's actions
* Simple game – rules are developed of a simple game during the game, like freeze tag.
* Inanimate Objects – improvisers become inanimate objects and do a very short monologue describing their perspective then perform a scene based on the interpersonal relationships of the objects.

==Second beat (A2, B2, C2)==

The second set of scenes heightens what was established in the first set. What it is heightening will differ from school to school. At the iO, the characters and relationships are heightened. At the Upright Citizens Brigade, the "game" of the scene is heightened.

A tool for this is a "Time Dash", where the scene picks up at a different point in time than last left (for example, a scene between a newly married couple with problems can take the second beat to show them on their tenth wedding anniversary).

After the second beat is another group game.

==Third beat (A3, B3, C3)==

The final set of three scenes (the third beat) connects themes, characters, situations, and games from the whole piece. Often, scenes merge into each other, avoiding the need to return to all three. The third beat is usually the shortest.

==Related forms==

Close allowed for and encouraged much variation within the structure of the Harold, and he saw it as a malleable and organic form with which to explore themes and ideas. The beats and games need not appear in the order or number described.

Most modern forms are derived from the Harold. These include: 

* Armando (The Armando Diaz Theatrical Experience and Hootenanny) – a host's monologues provide the inspiration for scenes. This form was created by [[Adam McKay]], [[David Koechner]], and Armando Diaz, and it was McKay who decided to name it after Diaz, who was also the first monologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://moneyandpower10.wordpress.com/2012/03/21/an-armando-diaz-experience/|title= An Armando Diaz Experience|last1= Serrao|first1= Nivea|date= March 21, 2012 |website= |publisher= WordPress|access-date= 28 June 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2015}}
* Deconstruction – one long opening group scene, which is used for idea generation.
* La Ronde – A series of short two-person scenes in which the first character is tagged out to be replaced by a third, then the second is replaced by a fourth etc., sometimes ending with the first character tagging back in for the final scene. Based on the format of [[La Ronde (play)|the play of the same name]] by [[Arthur Schnitzler]].
* Monoscene – One scene location, sometimes with improvisers playing different characters and sometimes playing the same characters for the entire piece. This form was made famous{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} in New York by the Upright Citizens Brigade team Death By Roo Roo, which included [[Adam Pally]] and [[Brett Gelman]].
* Movie – an improvised movie that uses disjointed situations which converge by the end.
* Sybil – one-person Harold.
* The Bat – a Harold performed in the dark, like a radio play.
* French Harold – a Harold performed within a monoscene, in which the improvisers perform the Harold in one location.
* Triptych/Triple Play – a form similar to a Harold, but without the group games.

'''''Hollywood Screen Test''''' is an American [[talent show]] which aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 1948 to 1953. This program holds the distinction as the first regularly broadcast television series by the American Broadcasting Company.

==Production background==
Originally the show aired on Sundays at 8pm ET. In later seasons, the show aired on Saturdays at 7:30pm ET and Mondays at 7:30pm ET.

This program was the first network series telecast on ABC, which began regular broadcasting in April 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present]]|year=2003|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=0-345-45542-8|pages=542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debuting on 15 April 1948, and hosted first by [[Bert Lytell]] and then [[Neil Hamilton (actor)|Neil Hamilton]], ''Hollywood Screen Test'' sought to give exposure to many up-and-coming actors who were looking for their big break. The relatively unknown actors would be picked to guest star on the show, then they would have half-hour scenes of dialogue with established stage and screen actors.

Many stars were discovered on ''Hollywood Screen Test'', including [[Grace Kelly]], [[Jack Klugman]], [[Pernell Roberts]], and [[Jack Lemmon]].

==Episode status==
Six episodes are in the collection of the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinema.library.ucla.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=hollywood+screen+test&amp;SL=None&amp;Search_Code=FTIT&amp;PID=FgMj1vELDciJtDhSGM_cwDOFU&amp;SEQ=20100823152420&amp;CNT=50&amp;HIST=1 UCLA Film and Television Archive entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hyperdrama''' is a dramatic performance generated by playscripts written in [[hypertext]]. The performance is noted for its split narrative with scenes branching to play simultaneously in an expanded performance space. The audience is mobile, able to follow actors and watch scenes as each individual chooses.

According to [[Astrid Ensslin]] in her book ''Canonizing Hypertext''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Canonizing Hypertext|last = Ensslin|first = Astrid|publisher = Continuum|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-8264-9558-7|location = |pages = 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Continuum, London, 2007), the term hyperdrama "was coined by hyperdramatist and theorist Charles Deemer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ibiblio.org/cdeemer/hdrama.htm|title = Hyperdrama|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; who understands 'traditional drama as a special case of hyperdrama' (p27)." Ensslin places Deemer's one-act hyperdrama ''The Last Song of Violeta Parra''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ibiblio.org/cdeemer/chile-m.html|title = The Last Song of Violeta Parra|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the canon of "first generation hypertext." Deemer also has written a hyperdrama expansion of Chekhov's ''The Seagull''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Seagull Hyperdrama|last = Deemer|first = Charles|publisher = Sextant Books|year = 2004|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Harvard’s The American Repertory Theater and [[Punchdrunk]] performed ''[[Sleep No More (2009 play)|Sleep No More]],'' "a [http://www.ibiblio.org/cdeemer/newhype.htm hyperdrama] rendition of ''Macbeth'' with a creepy, Hitchcock feel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://htlit.com/archives/October2009/SleepNoMore.html|title = Sleep No More|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Hannah Rudman, who wrote "[http://www.consultrudman.com/benefactor-play/ The Benefactor: a Hyperdrama]" in 1998 with Dr Billy Smart, describes the form this way: "A hyperdrama is a play that is written in hypertext, that is performed as a promenade and that is realised on multiple levels. Scenes happen simultaneously throughout a performance space. In this hyperdrama, there are five different locations where the action takes place. The scripts for the different locations are divided into levels which represent the time span of the piece (about 45 minutes real time). All the characters and locations in this hyperdrama are of equal importance. As a reader, you could follow the path of one character through the play by clicking on their hypertext links; read all the separate scripts in a linear fashion; or explore the hyperdrama more randomly by swapping between rooms via the hotlinks."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.consultrudman.com/benefactor-play/|title=The Benefactor: a Hyperdrama|last=Rudman|first=Hannah|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell Anderson, author of ''Woyzeck: a Hyperdrama,'' calls his play "a performance in &lt;span class="a"&gt;the ‘hyperdrama’ format: that is, where multiple elements of performance occur in multiple locations simultaneously."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.academia.edu/10351971/Woyzeck_a_Hyperdrama|title = Woyzeck: a Hyperdrama|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tegan Zimmerman uses the presentation software [[Prezi]] to explore "Hypertext and Hyperdrama" and their relationship online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://prezi.com/3bj3w8y4eq2d/hypertext-and-hyperdrama/|title = Hypertext and Hyperdrama|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other hyperdrama works of note are ''[[Tamara (play)|Tamara]]'' by John Krizanc, which had a long run in Los Angeles in the 1980s, and ''[[Tony and Tina's Wedding]]'', perhaps the most widely produced and popular hyperdrama.

A number of universities have added the study of Hyperdrama to their hypertext and electronic media studies: the University of Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/courses/ensp481/syllabus.html|title = Syllabus|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tunxis Community College,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tunxis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Hyperdrama08-syllabus-14-22.pdf|title = Course Syllabus|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; New York University,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nyu.edu/classes/keefer/TimeSpace/timespace.html|title = Writing: Time and Space|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; among them.

Discussion of hyperdrama is included in the book ''Theatre In Cyberspace'' (Peter Lang, 1999): "theatre practitioners are increasing their potential audiences with online technology while attempting to discover how to present theatre in an interactive yet non-corporeal way. Also fascinating is how educators and practitioners can collaborate, creating online performance spaces that can be adapted for teaching, and creating online teaching techniques that can be adapted for performance. This volume of essays presents information from some of the pioneers in the field of cyberspace theatre who write of their work in both theoretical and practical terms, thus creating a kind of ''Theatre and Its Double'' for computers and theatre."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=44689 |title=Peter Lang Publishers |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151510/http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=44689 |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The troupe has survived three generations, with his children Shambu Hegde, Mahabala Hegde and Gajanana Hegde and his grand son Shivananda Hegde also being exponents of Yakshagana. Keremane Shivananda Hegde is the current director of the troupe and the institution.

==Yakshagana==
Yakshagana is a folk art mostly performed in the coastal districts of the state of [[Karnataka]] (Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Uttara Kannada districts), western parts of Shimoga district and the [[Kasaragod district|Kasaragod]] district of [[Kerala]]. This folk art is usually performed in the night and involves dances and dialogues with the accompaniment of music using traditional musical instruments like ''[[chande]]'',

''[[maddale]]'' and ''tala''.&lt;ref name="yaksha" /&gt; The unique aspect of the art is the use of elaborate headgear and dresses by the performers. The incidents portrayed in this art form are based on [[mythology]]&lt;ref name="yaksha"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2005/01/07/stories/2005010702560600.htm|work=Online Edition of The Hindu, dated 2005-01-07|title=Yakshagana presented in typical vibrant shades|author=Chitra Mahesh|accessdate=2007-09-06|location=Chennai, India|date=2005-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the epics. The performing troupe is called ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Mela''' or ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Mandali''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' which is a traditional repertory and travels from place to place. A Mela or Mandali typically consists of 11-18 performing artists.

== Troupe Artists ==
Idagunji Mahaganapati Yakshagana Mandali was started in the year 1934 by [[Keremane Shivarama Hegde]], one of the exponents of the ''badagathittu'' style of Yakshagana.&lt;ref name="kere"&gt;{{cite web|title=The woman who gave me love|url=http://srramakrishna.googlepages.com/keremanystory|work=Nenapina Rangasthala, Akshara Prakashana, [[Heggodu]], 1996, Translated by S R Ramakrishna|author=G S Bhat|accessdate=2007-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Keremane Shivarama Hegde===
[[Keremane Shivarama Hegde]] was born in a [[Havyaka]] [[Brahmin]] family in Keremane in the [[Honnavar]] taluk of the Uttara Kannada district on 21 June 1908. He could not complete his primary education because of poverty and to earn a living he had to do odd jobs like driving a bus and booking tickets. He started performing Yakshagana from a young age of 14 and in the year 1934, he started his own troupe called as ''Idagunji Mahaganapati Yakshagana Mandali''.&lt;ref name="kere"/&gt;  The name of the troupe was chosen in honour of the [[Hindu]] God [[Ganapati]]. A famous temple of the God is located in the village of [[Idagunji]] in the Uttara Kannada district. He toured around the state of Karnataka with his troupe and started earning various awards for his efforts. He won the state award in 1965, Central Sangeet Natak Academy Award in 1970 and a [[Rajyotsava Award]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="kere"/&gt; The highest award won by him was the [[Rashtrapati Award]]. His autobiography called as ''Nenapina Rangasthala'' was recorded on cassette by G S Bhat in 1981 and published as a book by the Akshara Prakashana, [[Heggodu]] in the year 1996.

===Keremane Shambhu Hegde===
[[Kermane Shambhu Hegde]] is the son of Shivarama Hegde. He also entered the field of Yakshagana like his father and also earned various awards including the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]] award.&lt;ref name="ksh"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/ms/2005/12/20/stories/2005122000090400.htm|work=Online Edition of The Hindu, dated 2005-12-20|title=Entertains with fluid ease|author=Rupa Srikanth|accessdate=2007-09-06|location=Chennai, India|date=2005-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He brought in changes to the Yakshagana tradition by introducing truncated versions of the art form to make it more acceptable to people outside its traditional base. He established a school in his native village of Gunavante, [[Honnavar Taluk]], to systematize Yakshagana learning. This (Srimaya Yakshagana Kalakendra, Gunavante), even to this day, is serving as a [[Gurukula]] and nurturing upcoming yakshagana artists. He went on to become the chairman of the Karnataka Janapada (folk) and Yakshagana Academy.&lt;ref name="chair"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/03/13/stories/2006031307300400.htm|work=Online Edition of The Hindu, dated 2006-03-13|title=Awards for four Yakshagana artistes|accessdate=2007-09-06|location=Chennai, India|date=2006-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the characters portrayed by Shambhu Hegde are that of [[Balarama]], [[Jarasandha]] and [[Duryodhana]].&lt;ref name="perf"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/ms/2005/12/23/stories/2005122300250500.htm|work=Online Edition of The Hindu, dated 2005-12-23|title=Focus on rural art|author=Leela Venkataraman|accessdate=2007-09-06|location=Chennai, India|date=2005-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also acted in films and won the Karnataka State Film award for his supporting role in the [[Kannada film]], ''Parva'' in the year 2001-2002.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2002/10/04/stories/2002100404410600.htm|work=Online Edition of The Hindu, dated 2002-10-04|title='Dweepa' best film, Ravichandran best actor|accessdate=2007-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the Governing body of the South Zone Cultural Centre&lt;ref name="szc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.szcc.tn.nic.in/03_admin/Governing%20Body/governingbody.html |work=Online webpage of the South Zone Cultural Centre |title=Governing Body |accessdate=2007-09-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812204133/http://www.szcc.tn.nic.in/03_admin/Governing%20Body/governingbody.html |archivedate=2007-08-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also was a member of ''Rangasamaja'' which looks after the working of the repertory [[Rangayana]].&lt;ref name="ranga"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rangayana.org/rangasamaja.htm|title=Rangasamaja|work=Online webpage of Rangayana|accessdate=2007-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Keremane.jpg|400px|thumb|right|A banner indicating the performance of the Yakshagana, ''Indrajitu Kalaga - Ravana Vadhey'' by the Idagunji Mahaganapati Yakshagana Mandali]]

[[File:Puppeter of Kathputli colony.jpeg|thumb|Puppeteer of Kathputli Colony]]

'''Kathputli Colony''' is a colony of [[street performer]]s in [[Shadipur Depot]] area of [[Delhi]]. For the last 50 years, it is home to some 2,800 families of magicians, snake charmers, acrobats, singers, dancers, actors, traditional healers and musicians and especially puppeteers or [[Kathputli (Puppet)|kathputli]]-performers from [[Rajasthan]]. This makes it world’s largest community of street performers.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/show-begins-at-kathputli-colony/423940/ |title=Show begins at Kathputli Colony |date=16 Feb 2009 |work=Indian Express |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009231214/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/show-begins-at-kathputli-colony/423940/ |archivedate=2012-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ti"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1816792,00.html|title=Postcard from Kathputli: Magic Abounds in a Delhi Slum|date=20 Jun 2008|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine | first=Heidi J. | last=Shrager}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colony is undergoing an [[in situ]] redevelopment plan by [[Delhi Development Authority]] (DDA) of [[Government of Delhi]].&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web| title = The World’s Largest Community of Street Performers Is About to Be Torn Apart |work=Time| url = http://time.com/12073/india-kathputli-colony-of-street-artists-to-be-demolished/|date=4 March 2014| accessdate = 2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name Kathputli Colony comes from [[Hindi language]] word for puppet, [[Kathputli (Puppet)|Kathputli]].&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

==History==
The colony started in the 1950s, as a cluster of makeshift tents in an open field on the outskirts of Delhi, set up by itinerant puppeteers from Rajasthan, which gave the colony its name.&lt;ref name="BendixHasan-Rokem2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Regina Bendix|Regina F.

Today, it is prime real estate area surrounded by [[Mayapuri]] and [[Naraina]].&lt;ref name=time/&gt;&lt;ref name=smh10&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/magic-slum-may-vanish-in-puff-of-development-smoke-20100326-r33a.html|title=Magic slum may vanish in puff of development smoke|date=27 March 2010|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Redevelopment plan==
In 2010, Government of Delhi initiated the redevelopment project of the colony on a public-private partnership basis. The contract was granted to Raheja Developers. As per the plan, 2800 flats will be built in 10-story buildings on the 5.2 hectares, apart from that a portion of the land will be given to the developer to construct its own commercial and residential buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ‘Delhi’s famous colony of magicians and puppeteers awaits destruction'|publisher=Scroll.in | URL = http://scroll.in/article/660832/Delhi%E2%80%99s-famous-colony-of-magicians-and-puppeteers-awaits-destruction/|date=13 April 2014| accessdate = 2014-07-25 | first = Arnav | last = Das Sharma }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amid protests by residents and controversy, in early 2014, ahead of the 1 April 2014 deadline, some of the 2,754 families started shifting to transit camps built at Anand Parbat area 2&amp;nbsp;km away by the developer Rahejas. They are expected to stay here for the next two years, while the site undergoes construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ‘DDA granted undue benefits to Kathputli Colony redeveloper’ |publisher=The Hindu | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dda-granted-undue-benefits-to-kathputli-colony-redeveloper/article5836547.ece|date=27 March 2014| accessdate = 2014-03-31 | first = Mohammad | last = Ali }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Final del recital de Los Premios Mastropiero - Les Luthiers.jpg|thumb|249x249px|Les Luthiers in 2008.]]
'''Les Luthiers''' is an Argentine comedy-musical group, very popular also in several other [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries including [[Paraguay]], [[Guatemala]], [[Peru]], [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], [[Spain]], [[Colombia]], [[Mexico]], [[Uruguay]], [[Bolivia]], [[Cuba]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Venezuela]]. They were formed in 1967 by [[Gerardo Masana]], during the height of a period of very intense [[choral|choral music]] activity in Argentina's state universities. Their outstanding characteristic is the [[custom made instrument|home-made musical instruments]] (hence the name ''[[luthier]]s'', [[French language|French]] for "musical instrument maker"), some of them extremely sophisticated, which they skillfully employ in their recitals to produce music and texts full of high class and refined humor. From 1977 until his death in 2007, they worked with [[Roberto Fontanarrosa]], a renowned Argentine [[cartoonist]] and writer.

==Musical stylings==
Les Luthiers began writing humorous pieces primarily in a [[baroque (music)|Baroque]] style, especially imitating vocal genres such as [[cantatas]], [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s and [[serenata]]s.  Later, they diversified into humorous renditions of music in other genres, from [[Romanticism (music)|romantic]] [[lied]]er and [[opera]] to [[Pop music|pop]], [[mariachi]] and even [[Rap music|rap]].  Their stage show is often intermingled with humorous skits, frequently involving absurd situations, the music and biography of fictional composer [[Johann Sebastian Mastropiero]] and a heavy reliance on fairly sophisticated [[word play]].  Much of the humor derives from the basic contradictions between the formality and highly developed vocal and instrumental technique of classical musicians and the sheer silliness of their show. All members of the group provided their voices for the pigeons in the Latin American and Spanish dubbings of the 2008 Disney film, ''[[Bolt (2008 film)|Bolt]]''.

Les Luthiers have acknowledged the influence of [[Gerard Hoffnung]] and [[Peter Schikele]] in their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Masana|first=Sebastián|title=Gerardo Masana y la fundación de Les Luthiers|year=2005|publisher=Grupo Editorial Norma|page=240|url=https://books.google.com.co/books?id=vADPEJPGFcQC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;lpg=PA240&amp;dq=Les+Luthiers+on+Peter+Schickele&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3heLtR-vRT&amp;sig=0dMJC-UCkNE2miVmN7qNGoC4Mr0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1hVaUYqZKYuC9QS55YGIDg&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Les%20Luthiers%20on%20Peter%20Schickele&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Professor" Schikele invented in 1965 the fictional character of [[P.D.Q. Bach]], son of Johann Sebastian Bach. He also invented many unusual instruments based in real ones, in the same style of the group. He also used the fictional biography of his imaginary composer as a running gag in his musical act.

Mr. Hoffnung predated both acts, starting in 1956 the [[Hoffnung Music Festival]] and publishing many cartoons with imaginary instruments for a classical orchestra. [[Malcolm Arnold]] probably was the first person to write a parody of classical music using odd instruments when he wrote for a Hoffnung Concert the score of ''A Grand, Grand Overture'', a piece for orchestra and vacuum cleaners dedicated to US President [[Herbert Hoover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Another Evening of Hoffnung|newspaper=The Times|date=11 February 1963|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informal instruments==
Les Luthiers are known in particular for employing a diverse ensemble of invented instruments created from common, everyday materials.  The group's first home-made musical instrument, the ''bass-pipe a vara'' (a sort of [[trombone]]), was created by [[Gerardo Masana]], the founder of the group, by joining [[paperboard]] tubes found in the garbage and miscellaneous items. Forty years later, this instrument is still being used on stage.

The first informal instruments were relatively simple, like the ''Gum-Horn'', made with a hose, a [[funnel]] and a [[trumpet]]'s [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]], and some of them were born as a [[parody]] of [[musical instruments]], which is the case of the ''latín'' (referred to in English as fiddlecan) and the ''violata'', bowed instruments whose [[sounding board|resonating chambers]] are made out of a large tin for processed [[ham]] and a paint can respectively, the ''marimba de cocos'', a [[marimba]] made out of [[coconut]]s, and others.

Inventor and instrument-maker [[Carlos Iraldi]] (1920–1995), as "Les Luthiers' luthier", was responsible for inventing several more sophisticated instruments, including the ''mandocleta'', a [[bicycle]] whose rear [[Bicycle wheel|wheel]] moves the [[Strings (music)|strings]] of a [[mandolin]], the ''bajo barríltono'', a [[Double bass]] whose body is a giant [[barrel]], and others.

After Iraldi's death in 1995 [[Hugo Domínguez]] took his place, and made instruments such as the ''desafinaducha'', the ''nomeolbídet'' etc.

==Current members==
* [[Carlos López Puccio]]: Bowed Strings (violin, viola, cello), synthesizers, vocals, percussion, dactilophone, etc.
* [[Jorge Maronna]]: Vocals, fretted strings (guitar, bass, banjo, charango, lute...), cello, synthesizers, etc.
* [[Marcos Mundstock]]: Vocals, percussion, trumpet, synthesizer, etc.

'''Leslie Grade''' (3 June 1916 – 15 October 1979), born '''Laszlo''' (or '''Lazarus''') '''Winogradsky''', was a British theatrical [[talent agent]].&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Making of the Grades: Profile: The Grade Dynasty|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/making-of-the-grades-profile-the-grade-dynasty-1276495.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|author=Halstead, Richard|date=2 February 1997|publisher=Independent Print Ltd|accessdate=10 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110002230/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/making-of-the-grades-profile-the-grade-dynasty-1276495.html|archivedate=10 November 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, he co-founded the Grade Organisation (also known as Lew and Leslie Grade Ltd) with his elder brother, the [[impresario]] and producer [[Lew Grade, Baron Grade|Lew Grade]] (1906&amp;ndash;98). During the 1940s, the company became the UK's most successful [[light entertainment]] talent agency.&lt;ref name="20thCentTheatre"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Bevan, Ian|editor1=Chambers, Colin|title=The Continuum Companion to Twentieth-Century Theatre|year=2002|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|location=[[London]] and [[New York City]]|isbn=978-1-847140012|page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Grade, the youngest of three brothers, was born in [[London]]&lt;ref name="20thCentTheatre"/&gt; in 1916, four years after his [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Jewish]] family had emigrated from [[Tokmak, Ukraine|Tokmak]], [[Ukraine]]—then [[Imperial Russia]]n territory—[[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|in response to pogroms]].&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; Leslie and his siblings, Lew and [[Bernard Delfont|Bernard]] (1909&amp;ndash;94), were raised in [[Stepney]].&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; While their parents, Isaac and Olga, worked in the [[textile industry]], the brothers left school at the age of 14 to establish themselves in [[showbusiness]].&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;

With Lew, Grade became one of the UK's best-known and most respected media executives. During the late 1940s, his clients included [[Jack Benny]], [[Bob Hope]] and [[Danny Kaye]].&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; In the 1950s and 1960s, many artists represented by Grade appeared in the variety show ''[[Sunday Night at the London Palladium]]'', broadcast by Lew's ITV franchisee [[Associated Television]] (ATV).&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;

Grade's son [[Michael Grade]] is a former television executive who has held top-ranking posts within the [[BBC]], [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[Channel 4]]. Leslie Grade's first wife Lynn Smith left him for the wrestling commentator [[Kent Walton]] (whom she married in 1949). Grade had two additional children by his second marriage, to Audrey Smith: theatrical agent Anita Grade (now Land) and Antony Grade, formerly Vice-President of Exterior Design for [[Renault]] and currently Head of Design for [[Avtovaz]]. With his friend [[Harry Zussman]], Grade served, for many years, as a Director of [[Leyton Orient F.C.]]

Grade's career was curtailed by a series of [[stroke]]s in the mid-1960s, and the ownership of the Grade Organisation passed to Michael in 1966.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="20thCentTheatre"/&gt; It was part sold the following year, and renamed London Management under Michael's direction.&lt;ref name="20thCentTheatre"/&gt; Grade died in [[France]] in 1979.&lt;ref name="20thCentTheatre"/&gt; Unlike his brothers, he was not awarded a [[Peerage of the United Kingdom|peerage]] or a knighthood.&lt;ref name="20thCentTheatre"/&gt;

'''''Minipops''''' was a television series broadcast in 1983 on [[Channel 4]] in the United Kingdom. Designed primarily for younger viewers, it consisted of music performances on a brightly coloured set featuring [[preteen]] children singing then-contemporary [[pop music]] hits and older classics. The children were usually made to look like the original performers, including clothing and make-up. [[Controversy]] over children singing songs that often contained a subtext of adult content (in adult costumes and make-up) led to the show's cancellation after one series.

==History==
''Minipops'' was the brainchild of Martin Wyatt, who created a new kid group from [[London]] called the MiniPops and released an album in 1982 which reached the top 30 in the UK and Europe. This resulted in a French record label releasing a single from the album, "[[Stupid Cupid]]",  which was sung by Martin Wyatt's young daughter [[Jo Wyatt|Jo]]. The song reached number 1 in France, knocking "[[Ebony and Ivory]]" off the top spot.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Whatever Happened to the Minipops''? Channel 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Head of Entertainment Cecil Korer at Channel 4 and record producer Mike Mansfield embraced the idea of producing a TV show around the MiniPops; Korer believed it would boost and broaden the group's audience appeal. On 4 July 1982, thousands of amateur child performers from across Britain descended on a London theatre for the audition in a search to find additional children to sing and star in the television show with the original five members of the group.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Though the series was a success for Channel 4 (gaining 2,000,000 viewers), little thought was given to the ethics of child performers singing songs originally written for older artists and dressing and dancing in a provocative style (often influenced by the original performance).
Whilst embraced by children who loved the idea of ordinary children singing and dancing (as they did) along with their favourite songs, the show sat uneasily with some adults; this was capped by a performance from [[Joanna Fisher]], who covered the [[Sheena Easton]] song "[[9 to 5 (Sheena Easton song)|9 to 5]]" (known as "Morning Train" in the U.S.) in [[nightclothes]] and included the lyrics "night time is the right time, we make love".

In response, the programme began attracting criticism from commentators in the [[British media]] who suggested that portraying children in this manner (singing songs which often contained a subtext of adult content, often in unsuitable costumes and heavy make-up) was somewhat sinister (one caller on Channel 4's ''[[Right to Reply]]'' programme fumed, "''Minipops'' should be called ''MiniWhores''. Are you people out of your mind?").&lt;ref&gt;''Whatever Happened to the Minipops?'' documentary, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' charged ''Minipops'' with partial responsibility for "the slaying of childhood". 
The following is an excerpt from ''[[The Observer]]'' article of 27 February 1983:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Is it merely priggish to feel queasy at the sight of [[primary school]] minxes with rouged cheeks, eye [[make-up]] and full-gloss [[lipstick]] belting out songs like [[torch song|torch singers]] and waggling those places where they will eventually have places?  The final act of last week's show featured a chubby blonde totlette, thigh-high to a [[paedophile]], in a [[ra-ra skirt]] and [[high heels]]; her black knickers were extensively flashed as she bounced around singing the words '[[Iko Iko|See that guy all dressed in green/He's not a man, he's a loving machine.]]'  [[Kiddie porn]], a shop-window full of junior [[jailbait]]?  And does the show thrust premature sexual awareness onto its wide-eyed performers?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The child cast and the show's creators were somewhat shocked at the response and their misinterpretation, despite the ratings success. When Cecil Korer was replaced by Mike Bolland as head of entertainment for Channel 4, he cancelled plans for a second series.

==Discography==
Seven [[album]]s were produced and released in the UK, Europe and Canada.

===Albums===

After the television show:

* ''Christmas'' (1984)
* ''Let's Dance'' (1984)
* ''Wanna Have Fun'' (1985)
* ''Magic Juke Box'' (1986)
* ''Rocket to the Stars''

In Canada ''We're the Mini Pops'' was successful, becoming the third-highest-selling album in Canada at the time. This prompted the Minipops to hold a three-week [[Concert tour|tour]] in 1983, enjoying controversy-free success.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A number of [[Single (music)|singles]] were released across Europe.

=={{anchor|Other related TV shows}}Related TV shows==
On 11 October 2005, Channel 4 screened a follow-up programme called ''Whatever Happened to the Minipops?''. This featured a history of the show, interviews with the former Minipops and crew and a reunion at the original [[theatre]] where the programme was filmed.

===''The Day Today''===
In 1994 the [[BBC]] comedy ''[[The Day Today]]'' parodied the Minipops. The satirical news programme advertised a fictional ''Attitudes Night'' on [[BBC2]], which looked back at past television shows to illustrate how attitudes had changed. One such example was the programme "Kiddystare, Channel Four, 1983" in which nude [[toddler]]s romped for the pleasure of adults.

==Characters==

===Monk===
Monk is a cynical monkey who is continually insulting Conti and swearing when he does not have his demands fulfilled. He often deliberately shows irritation towards performing on stage and makes Conti laugh at his words.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2081260/|title=Her Master's Voice|date=6 February 2014|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shoard"&gt;{{cite news |last=Shoard |first=Catherine |date=15 March 2012 |title=Nina Conti: 'I feel it's not in my film how much I miss Ken' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/mar/15/nina-conti-ventriloquist-ken-campbell |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;He now appears in a new cartoon on TV series Pop

===Granny===
Granny is an elderly Scotswoman to whom Conti refers as someone who is a lot like her own grandmother. Granny often chides Conti for the simplest things Conti has done; for instance, when Conti reveals she has two legs, Granny responds by saying "Oh, two legs? You're spoiling me!" Her main act is to telepathically guess numbers or words, which she always guesses correctly. She also talks about her dead husband, Frank. Granny refers to people with words like "dear", "child" or "my daughter". The original prop was donated to [[Vent Haven Museum]] in July 2009, in memory of Ken Campbell, from whom Conti received her,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; but Conti had a replica made which she continues to use in her acts.

===Face mask===
The face mask, rather than an actual puppet with a personality, is a mask that covers the lower half of an audience participant's face and can be manipulated by a hand-piece held by Conti to make it look like the participant is talking. Conti often uses this to put the participant in awkward and funny situations, such as making them say that they want nothing more than to dance in front of the audience, while their body language suggests the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4BB1TZcO_o|title=Nina Conti on Russel Howard's Good News|first=|last=Angela Ritwo|date=2 June 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Conti was in a relationship with the comedian and actor [[Ken Campbell]]; from him she inherited his collection of ventriloquist dummies.&lt;ref name="Shoard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnston |first=Jenny |date=12 July 2012 |title=The ventriloquist who found her voice: Tom Conti's daughter on how her affair with a much older man gave her the confidence to go on stage |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2172824/The-ventriloquist-voice-Tom-Contis-daughter-affair-older-man-gave-confidence-stage.html |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |access-date=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dessau |first=Bruce |author-link=Bruce Dessau |date=4 May 2013 |title=Nina Conti: The acclaimed ventriloquist on the seductions of acting and throat-singing |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/nina-conti-the-acclaimed-ventriloquist-on-the-seductions-of-acting-and-throat-singing-8599847.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |access-date=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was married to Andrew "Stan" Stanley with whom she has had two children.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

'''October Eleven Pictures''' is an Irish Production Company based in Dublin, Ireland. It is a company dedicated to the development and encouragement of new and existing talent in the arenas of film, design and music. October Eleven Pictures was set up by [[The Figgis Brothers]], [[Jonathan Figgis]] and [[Jason Figgis]]. It was born out of their desire to write and produce feature films using the digital format in order to challenge the tried and tested formula of 35mm film. They believe that the future of film-making lies in this area as the restrictions of the spiralling cost of 35mm film (all too often the cause of the increasing number of Hollywood flops) has been one of the reasons for the unfortunate dampening of creativity in movie-making circles. 

They asked themselves the question: How many times has a brilliant idea been levelled by the restrictions of a budget? Digital technology answers the question of how to make an excellent quality film on tight finances. With the advent of 3chip DV, original ideas were finally beginning to be realized.

It was the Figgis Brothers childhood dreams of making movies and the advent of digital technology lead them to set up the company in February 2001. Jason directs while his younger brother Jonathan produces. Watching [[Hammer Films]] was a passion for them both and equal to the terror as they half hid behind pillows was the thrill at being confronted by monsters, swirling mists and dark villainous characters. The love of Hammer progressed to film noir with its enigmatic shadows depicting world's where the good as well as the bad seemed to inhabit the same sinister environment.

Darkness in varying forms is a strong trademark in their productions but they also have a lighter side which will be seen in future productions. Completing the team are a further two directors; Alan Foley, Creative Director and Mark Holmes, Finance Director.

'''''Once Upon a Time in China III''''' is a 1993 Hong Kong–Chinese [[martial arts film]] written, produced and directed by [[Tsui Hark]], starring [[Jet Li]] as [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] martial arts master and [[folk hero]] of [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] ethnicity, [[Wong Fei-hung]]. It is the third instalment in the [[Once Upon a Time in China (film series)|''Once Upon a Time in China'' film series]].

==Plot==
The film is set in [[China]] in the late 19th century during the [[Qing dynasty]] when Chinese sovereignty is being eroded by foreign imperialism. [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] and [[Li Hongzhang]] decide to stage a [[lion dance]] competition to showcase [[Chinese martial arts]] and restore national pride. Interested parties from all over China are invited to participate and compete for the title of "Lion Dance King".

[[Wong Fei-hung]] travels from [[Foshan]] to [[Beijing]] with his romantic interest [[Thirteenth Aunt|13th Aunt]] and apprentice Leung Foon to meet his father, [[Wong Kei-ying]], at the [[Ten Tigers of Canton|Cantonese Ten Tigers Association]]. At the train station, 13th Aunt meets Tomanovsky, a Russian diplomat, who was her classmate when she was studying in Britain. He starts vying for her attention and annoys Wong, who is disgusted by the Western custom of kissing a woman's hand. When Wong reaches the Cantonese Ten Tigers Association, he learns that his father has been attacked by a wealthy rival martial artist, Chiu Tin-bak, and Chiu's henchman, Kwai Geuk-chat, a.k.a Clubfoot Seven Chiu-Tsat (due to his disability and deformation, [[clubfoot]], as he is the 7th member of Chiu Tin-bak's apprentices, disciples and henchmen, which is how he was nicknamed), but sustained only minor injuries. Wong Kei-ying decides to give his blessings to his son and 13th Aunt when he sees they are becoming closer to each other.

Before the competition officially begins, all the lion dance troupes that have gathered in Beijing are already fighting among themselves and holding another competition of their own. Wong does not participate and spectates instead. Unknown to him, Leung and his friends have secretly joined the competition out of mischief. A short chase takes place between Clubfoot Seven Chiu-Tsat and Leung when the latter annoys the former during the contest and flees. Clubfoot Seven Chiu-Tsat's legs are crushed when Leung accidentally releases a stampede of horses from a stable. Chiu abandons Clubfoot Seven Chiu-Tsat when he sees that he is now a useless cripple. Wong takes pity on Clubfoot Seven Chiu-Tsat, brings him in, and heals his legs. Clubfoot Seven Chiu-Tsat is initially hostile towards Wong, but he feels so touched and grateful to Wong that he starts bawling emotionally, and becomes Wong's new apprentice.

With the aid of a camera given to her by Tomanovsky, 13th Aunt inadvertently uncovers a plot to assassinate Li Hongzhang during the competition and learns that Tomanovsky is one of the conspirators. She warns Wong, who joins the contest to stop the assassins. In the final round of the competition, Wong, Leung and Clubfoot Seven Chiu-Tsat fight with dozens of rival lion dancers as they battle their way to the top of a scaffold. Chiu also joins the competition and carries a large and deadly lion mask. Wong ultimately defeats Chiu and wins the competition.

In the meantime, Tomanovsky fails to assassinate Li Hongzhang and is shot dead by his fellow Russians, who confirm their suspicions that he is a spy working for the Japanese embassy. Wong refuses to accept the prize, a gold medal, and says that his victory is a [[Pyrrhic victory]] because the competition only led to greater conflict among the Chinese people. He throws the medal back to Li Hongzhang, turns his back on Li and walks away.

'''''Pound of Ground ''''' is an action game developed by [[Centauri Production]] and published by [[Akella]] on December 9, 2009.

==Plot and gameplay==
In terms of gameplay, it is a story-driven [[shoot 'em up]] around saving the city from danger and making things right again.

==Critical reception==
IGN listed off a series of weaknesses of the game including its: "unlikeable characters", "unimaginative quest goals", "bland action", "disposable story scenes", and "awful voice acting", ultimately deeming it disposible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/11/11/pound-of-ground-review|title=Pound of Ground Review|first=Charles|last=Onyett|date=10 November 2010|website=ign.com|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absolute Games offered a mixed review, citing that while the story was interesting, its gameplay let it down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ag.ru/games/evil-days-pound-of-ground/review|title=Pound of Ground: Убитые дважды (Evil Days: Pound of Ground) - рецензия и обзор на игру на AG.ru|website=www.ag.ru|language=Russian|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Screen Cartoonist's Guild (SCG)''' was an American labor union formed in 1938 in Los Angeles, California. The SCG was formed in the aftermath of protests at [[Van Beuren Studios]] and [[Fleischer Studios]], and represented workers and resolved issues at major American animation studios such as [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]].

==Prehistory==
The onset of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929 as well as bank holidays enacted by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1933 made it impossible for Wall Street investors to supply the major [[Hollywood]] film studios with the cash flow they needed. Studio executives cut salaries for their employees but took no cuts for themselves, leading to a mass spree of unionization in Hollywood. The executives retaliated by firing union members and picketers at a steady rate.

In Hollywood, animators were originally unionized under the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] in 1914. Noticing that there was not a union to solely represent animators, [[Bill Nolan (animator)|Bill Nolan]] unsuccessfully tried to form such a union in 1925, and a group formed by [[Grim Natwick]], [[Shamus Culhane]], and [[Al Eugster]] in 1932 was disbanded after executives began to threaten its employees and many members lost their jobs.&lt;ref name =Sito&gt;{{cite book|last=Sito|first=Tom|title=Drawing the line : the untold story of the animation unions from Bosko to Bart Simpson|date=2006|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0813124077|pages=64–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York City, where studio unions were generally better off, [[Bill Littlejohn]], along with [[Hicks Lokey]], John McManus, and Jim Tyer, formed the Unemployed Artists Association, which became the Commercial Artists and Designers Union (CADU) due to Roosevelt's policies, and later the Animated Motion Picture Worker's Union (AMPWU). These two unions were the most immediately approached in New York when employees were mistreated.

===Van Beuren protest===
In 1935, [[Van Beuren Studios]] fired Sadie Bodin, an inker and scene planner, for pro-union sentiment, though she argued the [[Wagner Act]] prevented them from doing so. Van Beuren ordered employees to take unpaid overtime or risk being fired, and supervisor [[Burt Gillett]] treated them very poorly, having fired Bodin to replace her with someone "whose attitude was better". Bodin and her husband responded by protesting, becoming the first people to picket an animation studio.

Inspired by Bodin's protest, the AMPWU brought legal action against Van Beuren, but lost. Gillett subsequently fired union members and had them blacklisted so that they could never regain work.&lt;ref name =Sito/&gt;

===Fleischer strike===
Bodin's strike led key Van Beuren employees to leave for Fleischer Studios. The studio gave poor wages but generous bonuses and threw extravagant parties, though [[Max Fleischer]]'s controlling behavior offended immigrant workers who had escaped dictatorships. When artist Dan Glass died due to poor working conditions, the CADU blamed his death on Fleischer and began protesting outside the studio. Fleischer retaliated by firing union sympathizers and quoting sentiment from anti-union employees in print.&lt;ref name =Sito/&gt;

At Fleischer, the first coordinated strike at an animation studio began in 1937 after the company fired thirteen pro-union employees. The strike lasted several months before Fleischer's partner [[Paramount Pictures]] intervened and demanded they sign a contract with the CADU. This led to better working conditions and a paid week of vacation, as well as holidays and screen credits, and previously fired employees were re-hired.

===Founding===
The events at Van Beuren and Fleischer led to the formation of the SCG in 1938, with Littlejohn as president. [[Herbert Sorrell]] later became president in 1941. The SCG became a chapter of the [[Conference of Studio Unions]] and was awarded jurisdiction over all matters pertaining to animation studios by the [[National Labor Relations Board]].

==History and impact==
The SCG was joined throughout its life by animators from Van Beuren and Fleischer, as well as [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Leon Schlesinger Productions (later Warner Bros. Cartoons)]], the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio]], and the [[Screen Gems]] cartoon studio, all of whom it secured contracts with.&lt;ref name =Sito/&gt;

The SCG was instrumental in the [[Disney animators' strike|strike at Walt Disney Productions]] in 1941. Studio head [[Walt Disney]] fired [[Art Babbitt]] for being a member of the SCG, prompting more than 200 employees to go on strike. The strike resulted in half the studio's employees leaving for other studios, such as [[David Hilberman]] and [[John Hubley]], who formed [[United Productions of America]]. Disney himself was left with a permanent distrust of pro-union employees, and blamed Babbitt among others for the strike. &lt;ref name =Sito/&gt;

The SCG was succeeded by [[The Animation Guild, I.A.T.S.E. Local 839]], which still exists today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sito|first1=Tom|title=Guild History|url=http://animationguild.org/guild-history/|website=The Animation Guild}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Femdom at Eros Pyramide.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|Live sex show at [[Eros Pyramide]], Austria, 2009]]
A '''sex show''' is a form of live [[performance]] that features one or more performers engaging in some form of [[sexual activity]] on stage for the entertainment or sexual gratification of spectators. Performers are paid either by the spectators or by the organisers of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.celebrity-mania.com/news/view/00005096.html |title=Dita Von Teese Got Her Unpaid Fee From Erotica Limited |publisher=Celebrity-mania.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113204801/http://www.celebrity-mania.com/news/view/00005096.html |archivedate=2012-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/uks-parliament-hosts-erotica-event/story-fn3dxix6-1225933252775 |title=UK parliament hosts erotica event |publisher=Theaustralian.com.au |date=2012-02-17 |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A performance would involve an actual or simulated [[autoeroticism|autoerotic]] performance or sexual activity with another performer. The performance can be on a theater style, or it can be in a [[peep show]] style. An increasingly popular form of sex show is a [[webcam]] performance in which the viewer is able to view and interact with [[webcam model]]s in real time.

Sex shows are distinguished from entertainment such as [[striptease]], [[pole dancing]] or [[lap dance]], which do not involve sexual activity other than undressing and dancing nude or semi-nude. Sexual activity at sex shows is also distinguished from regular [[prostitution]] in that the performers usually engage in sex acts only with other performers and not with spectators or paying customers. Sex shows can overlap with other sectors of the [[sex industry]]. For example, a [[strip club]] may also offer live sex performances, and a prostitute may offer to perform sex acts with another prostitute for the gratification of a patron.

==Locations==
In [[Havana]], Cuba in the 1950s there were sex shows and live pornographic theaters such as the Shanghai Theater and the Tokyo Cabaret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WBvTDQAAQBAJ|title=Inside Cuba: The History, Culture, and Politics of an Outlaw Nation|first1=John|last1=Miller|first2=Aaron|last2=Kenedi|year=2003|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=9781569244845|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English novelist [[Graham Greene]], writing in his autobiography ''[[Ways of Escape]]'', described: "the Shanghai Theatre where for one dollar and twenty-five cents one could see a nude cabaret of extreme obscenity with the bluest of blue films in the intervals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nAVRDQAAQBAJ|title=Havana: A Subtropical Delirium|first=Mark|last=Kurlansky|year=2017|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|isbn=9781632863935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s the [[Laos|Laotian]] capital [[Vientiane]] was famous for sex shows at [[ping pong show]] bars during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=FandD&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factsanddetails.com/southeast-asia/Laos/sub5_3b/entry-2961.html |title=Sex in Laos |author=Jeffrey Hays |date=2008 |website=Facts and Details |publisher= |access-date=21 September 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travel writer [[Paul Theroux]] described a bar in 1973 Vientiane thus: “Your eyes get accustomed to the dark and you see the waitress is naked. Without warning she jumps on the chair, pokes a cigarette into her vagina and lights it, puffing it by contracting her uterine lungs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Theroux |first= Paul |date=1975 |title=The Great Railway Bazaar |location= |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |page= |isbn=978-0141189147}}&lt;/ref&gt; British journalist [[Christopher Robbins]] wrote that ''The White Rose'', a famous Vientiane bar during the war, featured floor shows in which women used their vaginas to smoke cigarettes and fling ping pong balls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Robbins |first= Christopher |date=1978 |title=Air America |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn=978-1908059017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Reeperbahn]], the red-light district of [[Hamburg]], several sex theatres (''Salambo'', ''Regina'', ''Colibri'', ''Safari'') were once located in the ''{{lang|de|[[Große Freiheit]]}}'' ("Great Freedom") street. They showed live sex acts on stage, but by 2007 the ''Safari'' was the only live sex theatre left in Germany,&lt;ref name=indep&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/death-of-the-reeperbahn-hamburgs-streets-of-shame-799034.html|title=Death of the Reeperbahn: Hamburg's streets of shame|newspaper=The Independent|date=21 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that closed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.abendblatt.de/hamburg/hamburg-mitte/article124554323/Kiezclub-Safari-schliesst-nach-50-Jahren-seine-Tueren.html|title=Kiezclub Safari schließt nach 50 Jahren seine Türen|first=Daniel|last=Schaefer|date=5 February 2014|newspaper=Hamburger Abendblatt|language=de|trans-title=Neighborhood Club Safari Closes its Doors after 50 Years}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[red light district]] of [[De Wallen]] in [[Amsterdam]] there are three main venues for sex shows: a [[Host and hostess clubs|hostess bar]] called the ''Bananen Bar'', and the ''Moulin Rouge'' and ''Casa Rosso'' theatres which feature on-stage sex acts and variations on the ping pong show. In Thailand, locations like [[Patpong]] in [[Bangkok]], [[Walking Street, Pattaya]], Bangla Road in [[Phuket]] and Ta Pae Gate in [[Chiang Mai]] have numerous venues hosting ping-pong shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and Sex Tourism Landscapes|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QiUlDwAAQBAJ|first=Erin|last=Sanders-McDonagh|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2016|isbn=9781317601159|p=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bangkok-nightlife.com/bkk-nightlife-guide/|title=Bangkok Nightlife 2018 (UPDATED!)|work=Bangkok-Nightlife.com|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
Sex shows are subject to varying laws such as licensing requirements and locations are subject to local zoning regulations.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., in the United Kingdom, sex establishments require a 
[http://www.winchester.gov.uk/Business/LicencesAndStreetTrading/SexEstablishmentLicence/ Sex Establishment Licence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119082102/http://www.winchester.gov.uk/Business/LicencesAndStreetTrading/SexEstablishmentLicence/ |date=2010-11-19 }} from the City Council under the ''Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act'' 1982, and a premises licence under the ''Licensing Act'' 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions regard a sex show as prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;news.com.au: [http://www.news.com.au/travel/news/coffee-shop-girls-face-charges-over-sex-shows/story-e6frfq80-1225827686559 Coffee shop girls face charges over sex shows] February 08, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The content of a sex show may also be subject to national and local [[obscenity]] and other laws. Some areas allow striptease, but no sexual activity, others may allow only simulated sexual activity or autoerotic activity, while others allow anything that is legal in recorded pornography to be performed live.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Generally, as of 2010, autoerotic activity is the most common legally-available kind of live sexual activity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} In some cities and countries throughout the world, live sexual activity between multiple performers are legal. Webcam performances are largely unregulated.

'''Shaike Ophir''' ({{lang-he|שייקה אופיר}}; November 4, 1928 – August 17, 1987) was an Israeli film actor and comedian, and the country's first [[mime]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B9RV5UFtPNMC&amp;pg=PA513&amp;lpg=PA513&amp;dq=shaike+ophir+prize&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QMZs1-U-tP&amp;sig=eR279W8EojNNqxoAJr1DY8cImz4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kgtGS4DaOovS4QafucD5Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=shaike%20ophir%20prize&amp;f=false ''The World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: Europe,'' Don Rubin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JVL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shaike Ophir|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/ShaikeOphir.html|publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
'''Yeshayahu (Shaike) Goldstein-Ophir''' was born in [[Jerusalem]]. His family roots in the city go back to the mid-19th century.
He studied acting as an adolescent, but left school in the 1940s to join the [[Palmach]]. During [[1948 Arab-Israeli War|Israel’s War of Independence]] he escorted convoys to the besieged city of Jerusalem, and took part in naval battles.

==Career==
Thanks to his comic skills he was accepted to the [[Chezbatron]], an army entertainment troupe. 
In the 1950s, he made a name for himself as a multi-talented performer. He had even recorded a few hit songs during this period.

During the late 1950s and early 1960s Ophir occasionally guest-starred in American TV shows such as ''[[Shirley Temple's Storybook]]'' and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' (in the episode "The Waxwork," where he was billed as Shai K. Ophir). Ophir acted in 28 films, wrote, directed and starred in several variety shows and was an accomplished mime, appearing alongside [[Marcel Marceau]]. He reached the peak of his international fame in the title role of ''Ha-Shoter Azoulay'' (literally, ''Policeman Azoulay'', translated as ''[[The Policeman]]''), a film-vehicle by [[Ephraim Kishon]] which won a [[Golden Globe]] for Best Foreign-Language Film (1972) and was nominated for a Best Foreign Language [[Academy Award]] the same year. He also starred in other Ephraim Kishon films, including ''[[Ervinka]], [[Blaumilch Canal]]'' and ''[[The Fox in the Chicken Coop]]'', and the 1973 [[Moshé Mizrahi]] film ''[[Daughters, Daughters]]''. In 1977 he starred opposite [[Melanie Griffith]] in ''[[The Garden (1977 film)|The Garden]]''.

In 1985, Ophir starred in a stage adaptation of [[Janusz Korczak]]'s children's novel ''King Matt the First'', where he played seven different roles. The children's play was very successful and ran for three years. Over this period Ophir was diagnosed with lung cancer, to which he succumbed in 1987. Ophir was a theatrical director for [[HaGashash HaHiver]]. He also directed the Israeli movie ''[[Hamesh Ma'ot Elef Shahor]]'', and wrote the screenplay for 4 Israeli movies. He wrote and performed many sketches and comedy routines, many of which are still popular in Israel today. He also did a series of Arabic-instruction TV programs that ran through the 1980s.

He also appeared in the [[Chuck Norris]] film, ''[[The Delta Force]]''.

{{nihongo|'''''Suki na Mono wa Suki Dakara Shōganai!!'''''|好きなものは好きだからしょうがない!!|}}, also known as '''''Sukisho!''''' or ''Sukisyo!'' is a [[light novel]] that has since expanded into a [[Yaoi|Boys' Love game]] (a type of [[Visual Novel]]), an [[anime]] series and [[OVA]].  The title translates into [[English language|English]] as "I like what I like, so it can't be helped", or "I like what I like, so there!"  The best known of the versions is the BL game, which features mild BL, and, in the original PC release, hardcore BL. The story is owned by SOFTPAL and Platinum Label, and the illustrations to the novels and games is by [[Tsutae Yuzu]].

==Plot==
High-school student Sora Hashiba was hospitalized after falling from the fourth floor of the school building. On his first night back in the [[dormitory]], he wakes to find a strange boy addressing him by the name "Yoru". The stranger identifies himself as "Ran"  and says he's Sora's new roommate. The next day, Sora's childhood friend and dorm manager, Matsuri Honjou, informs Sora that the other boy, whom Matsuri identifies as Sunao Fujimori or "Nao-kun," is actually another childhood friend of Sora. Sora doesn't remember meeting Sunao before. In fact, Sora can't remember much of anything regarding his past, and the series follows his quest to regain his memory.

Sora soon learns why Sunao identified himself as "Ran" that first night: he and Sora have [[Dissociative identity disorder|alternate personalities]]. Sora's is Yoru, a powerful protector and the lover of the more dependent, feminized Ran. The existence of these alternate personalities, and the relationship between them, has some mysterious connection with Sora's fall from the window and his forgotten past. The alternate personalities' passionate relationship is a far cry from the hostility and distrust between Sora and Sunao. Because Yoru and Ran possess them arbitrarily, Sora and Sunao frequently find themselves in embarrassing situations when they regain control of their minds.

Other comical situations arise from Matsuri's efforts to draw Sora and Sunao into his moneymaking schemes, known as the group "The School Do-It-Alls" and from such minor characters as a [[bishōnen]] ghost and three younger boys who resemble the trio. No parents are ever mentioned, and the only authority figures are school nurse Kai Nanami and math teacher Shin-ichirou Minato, but it is known that Sora and Sunao are both orphans. Both have some connection with Sora and Sunao's dark past, which also involves one of the older students at the school, Kai Nagase, and a mysterious doctor named Aizawa.

==Characters==
;{{Nihongo|'''Sora Hashiba'''|羽柴 空|Hashiba Sora}}
:Voiced by: [[Hikaru Midorikawa]], Rika Higashino (child)
The main character of ''Sukisho''. Sora can't remember his past and at first doesn't know he has an alternate personality named Yoru. Sora has spiky blue hair, blue eyes, and is usually easy going, and also loves to eat. As a dominant male, he has a complicated and occasionally hostile relationship with his roommate and former childhood friend Sunao Fujimori. Normally, he refers to Sunao by his last name, Fujimori. Sora also seems to be the character most often harmed in the anime. 

;{{Nihongo|'''Yoru'''|夜|Yoru}}
:Voiced by: [[Takehito Koyasu]]
Sora's alternate personality. Unlike Sora, Yoru is both shrewd and flirtatious. He is considered the [[Yaoi#Seme and uke|seme]] of the couple. Yoru loves Ran, but he isn't above flirting with anyone. He loves Ran and will often show it when in bed with him (which embarrasses  Sunao in the aftermath). However, Yoru will protect Sora when he feels a need. In the game, he also likes to joke around with Sora by placing images of Sora's friends in odd positions (including Sunao and Ran, Hiromu, Nanami, and oddly enough, Yoru himself). Yoru can be distinguished from Sora by his slightly darker hair, increased height, deeper voice and a glowing amber left eye. He is also usually seen with a long white piece of cloth tied to his right arm. In one of the drama CDs it is said that he tried to kill himself because he left Ran in the lab, and wears the white cloth as a memento. 

;{{Nihongo|'''Sunao Fujimori'''|藤守 直|Fujimori Sunao}}
:Voiced by: [[Souichirou Hoshi]], Madoka Akita (child)
Sunao is Sora's childhood friend and current roommate. Sunao has long pink hair usually tied with a long piece of red ribbon and pink eyes, and an alternate personality named Ran. Easily angered, he isn't above punching anyone who makes him lose his temper, especially Sora, who he punches a few times in the beginning of the anime series. At first, he claims he hates Sora, but he becomes closer to Sora with each game/episode, eventually consummating his relationship with Sora. Just as Sora calls Sunao by his last name, Sunao refers to Sora as Hashiba; in some episodes, Sunao calls Sora by the childhood nickname of "Kuu-chan" instead. 

;{{Nihongo|'''Ran'''|らん|Ran}}
:Voiced by: [[Kappei Yamaguchi]] (Game/Drama CD), Souichirou Hoshi (anime)
Just as Sora has Yoru, Sunao also has an alternate personality, named Ran (蘭), which is Japanese for orchid. Ran is dependent, demanding and in some cases more feminine than Sunao. Ran is the [[Yaoi|uke]] of the pairing, and loves Yoru to the point of an obsession. He will occasionally flirt with Sora only to bring out Yoru. Ran can be distinguished from Sunao by his slightly brighter pink hair color (in the game), higher voice, and red eyes; in the anime, the red eyes are the only feature the two personalities don't share. Unlike Yoru, Ran never harasses Sunao, though he will attempt to seduce anyone else. Note that Kappei Yamaguchi is the voice actor for Ran in the Drama CD and games, but the same voice actor (Hoshi Souichirou) plays both Sunao and Ran the anime. 

;{{Nihongo|'''Matsuri Honjou'''|本城 祭|Honjō Matsuri}}
:Voiced by: [[Susumu Chiba]], Chiro Kanzaki (child)
A close childhood friend of both Sora and Sunao, Matsuri has long blond hair and green eyes. The dorm manager and head of the Do-It-All Club (in the anime), Matsuri always carries a camera, frequently taking fun (if embarrassing for Sora) snapshots. He's an upbeat person who likes to tease his friends, often inventing elaborate plans usually revolving around getting Sora and Sunao together, or making money. Sora and Sunao rarely like any of Matsuri's ideas, but the pair tends to go along with Matsuri despite that. Note that the Jack-of-All-Trades club that Matsuri establishes in the anime does not exist in the games. Also, he resembles Saotome Haruna from ''[[Mahou Sensei Negima]]'' in both image (Long hair with antennae) and ''Paru sama'' personality + Kazumi paparazzi.

;{{Nihongo|'''Kai Nanami'''|七海 かい|Nanami Kai}}
:Voiced by: [[Akira Ishida]]
The school nurse. Nanami is possibly the most feminine character in Sukisho (second most feminine would probably be Ran). The perfect housewife, Nanami cooks and cleans with a smile on his face. He lives with Shin-ichirou, whom he is in love with (they are seen sharing the same bed in the anime and the dramas show them to be married). He is very nice and easy to talk to, although he is constantly haunted with guilt because of his past where he worked with Aizawa conducting immoral experiments on humans in an effort to help Shin-ichiro with his own mental condition. There is hardly any difference between the games and the anime when concerning Nanami, but in the games he tends to be slightly more high strung (he can and WILL punch Shin-ichirou when he feels the need for it). Nanami has brown shoulder length hair (may be slightly longer) and blue eyes. 

;{{Nihongo|'''Shin-ichirou Minato'''|水都 真一朗|Minato Shin'ichirō}}
:Voiced by: [[Shinichirou Miki]]
The school math teacher. He loves Nanami and cares very much for Sora and Sunao (who often refer to him as 'nii-chan'or "brother" though they are not blood related). Usually, Shin-ichirou is very easy going and somewhat immature, though caring. He will often flirt with Nanami, but most of the time in a playful way. He is, however, very prone to jealousy and he also has another side of him often referred to as 'Minato' or 'Minato-sensei'. As Minato, he is very flirtatious and will attempt to force people into sex (often Sora or Nanami). Usually, Nanami just has to mess up Minato's hair or punch him to bring back Shin-ichirou. In White Flower, Minato acts more evil and becomes Aizawa's slave after being brainwashed. Shin-ichirou has black spiky hair and blue eyes. As Minato, his hair is a lot more tidy and sometimes his eyes are pitch black. 

;{{Nihongo|'''Gaku Ichikawa'''|市川 学|Ichigawa Gaku}}
:Voiced by: [[Atsushi Kisaichi]]
Sora's friend, he is a year younger than Sora. He has a crush on Nagase Kai, manager of the Chemistry labs. He seems to be always happy, and he tries to help his friend any way he can. A sincere boy of pure feelings, Sora says that "He expresses four times more his feelings than the majority of the people". In the game ''Mou Matte'', Gaku is given the position of main character and must choose to either continue his relationship with Nagase (as the uke, or bottom) or start a new one with Shiina (as the seme, or top). 

;{{Nihongo|'''Kai Nagase'''|永瀬 芥|Nagase Kai}}
:Voiced by: [[Ryoutarou Okiayu]]
He is the chemistry lab manager. A quiet, serious and mysterious man, yet he is very intelligent and has gotten his thesis printed in numerous science magazines. Gaku is in love with him, admires him and is always praising him whenever he can. Nagase knows this, and takes advantage of this when needed. But finally, he changed because of Gaku's true love. He is the son of Professor Aizawa, the main antagonist. 

;Sei, Ren Shiina, and Fuuta Kitamura 
:Voiced by: [[Kouki Miyata]] (Sei), Chiro Kanzaki (Ren, anime), [[Motoki Takagi]] (Ren, OVA), [[Yu Kobayashi]] (Fuuta, anime), [[Takahiro Sakurai]] (Fuuta, OVA)
Three children who have become attached to Sora, Sunao, and the rest. It is unknown if Sei and Shiina have parents, but Kitamura has become Hano Yoshihiro's stepbrother (which he resents in the anime). Sei resembles Sora while Shiina resembles a young Nanami. Kitamura does not really resemble anyone, but fans have said he somewhat resembles Sunao due to his hot pink hair. After episode 3, they are never seen apart and seem to act identical for most of the series (except in episode 13, the OVA). In the games, their personalities are a lot more diverse and they are very similar Sora, Sunao, and Matsuri when they were in school. Sei acts the most immature of three (Sora), Kitamura comes up with various plans and likes to joke around (Matsuri), and Shiina tends to be the more effeminate tsundere (Sunao). They also live together in the same dorms. In the games and their teacher is Sora. Although not exactly related, Sei is sometimes seen as Sora and Sunao's child. In the games, Shiina also has a crush on Gaku and whether or not he ends up with Gaku depends on the player's choice (in both White Flower and Mou Matte). Kitamura can also end up with Gaku, but only in Mou Matte. In the game Sei is Sora's clone. He cannot speak first, but starts to trust Sunao and Sora after a while. After White Flower, the three of them are like a family. Ren (蓮) or (恋) means 'lotus' or 'romance, love' in Japanese. 

;Kano
:Voiced by: Michiru Yamazaki
The adopted child of Ayano. He is really shy and unexpressive, seems to be a chibi-Gaku as Sei-kun to Sora (chibi-Sora). The first time he smiled was when Ayano used his favourite plushie (a pink rabbit) to talk to him. Since then, Ayano always brings it with him. In the games and novels, Aizawa made Kano out of DNA from Gaku Ichikawa as he admired Gaku's cheerfulness. 

;Soushi Asaka
:Voiced by: [[Yuji Ueda]]
Occasionally appears in the game and makes brief appearances in the anime. Soushi is a lawyer who loves to flirt with Nanami. Most of the time, he playfully flirts with Nanami just to anger Shin-ichirou. Compared to most of the character, he acts a lot more refined, but he will occasionally get mad (especially if children are making too much noise). In the games, there are scenes where he and Sora have sex (depending on the choices the player makes). The PS2 game and the Drama CDs show that Soushi and Matsuri could become a couple. He is also the middle brother of Shin-ichirou Minato and Ryouya Kozuki. 

;Ryouya Kozuki
:Voiced by: [[Toshiyuki Morikawa]]
Shin-ichirou's and Soushi's older brother. He has a psychiatric clinic and he does double-personalities-analysis to Sora and to Sunao (with Soushi's and Nanami's approval, though the same can not be said for Sora and Sunao). He brings always with him a pink rabbit and does ventriloquism with it to his adopted child, Kano-kun (seemingly a bit unexpressive and shy enough). Smiles often and loves children. In the games, he originally worked for Aizawa. 

;Hiromu Sakura
:Voiced by: [[Daisuke Sakaguchi]]
A young boy who loves Sora (later on he loves Sunao in the game). He gets into an accident that puts him into the hospital. He then becomes a wandering spirit, but what he does differs between the anime and the games. In the anime, Hiromu haunts the halls of the school to find Sora. In the games, he possesses Sunao and tries to spend time with Sora (this is indicated by Sunao's sudden hair color change to white and the playful tune in the background). Hiromu acts very innocent and playful. Eventually, his spirit returns to his body. In First Limit, Sora can end up with Hiromu if the players makes the right choices. 

;Yoshihiro Hano
:Voiced by: [[Kenji Nojima]]
Gaku Ichikawa's classmate, and is also close to Fuuta Kitamura. He is cheerful and enjoys chemistry, just like Gaku, and is the step brother of Fuuta Kitamura. In the games and novels, he has an obsession with putting pink bows in his hair. 

;Chris
:Voiced by: [[Hiro Yuuki]]
A character appearing only in the games and the OVA, he is a young boy who works at a nearby church and has a very close relationship with Sora Hashiba. In Target Nights, he became friends with Sora, but ended almost killing Sora and Sunao because he said that Sora was possessed. Later, it is revealed that Aizawa manipulated his feelings to get revenge on Nanami (who was Chris real target) to which Chris apologies. Chris also has a love interest in Nanami, the two where close friends when Nanami worked for Aizawa in the laboratory. On the next games, he became a recurring character and a real friend of Sora and his friends.  

;Aizawa
:Voiced by: [[Jūrōta Kosugi]]
Aizawa is the main antagonist in Sukisho. He is a professor at the university which Sunao attends after the games, and the chemistry department advisor. Aizawa is obsessed with studying medicine and cloning and even invented medicine that can control the mind and emotions of human beings. Aizawa grew up with and became friends with Shin-ichirou Minato and Kai Nanami. Aizawa struggled with psychological issues, unable to function properly in public, and had issues handling his emotions. Aizawa had begun falling in love with Shin-ichirou Minato but failed to cope with such emotions. As he entered high school, he switched schools and Kai Nanami wound up working and studying under him by college so he can help Shin-ichirou with his schizophrenia but left after Aizawa attacked him. Aizawa became obsessed with causing Nanami pain and shortly after, kidnapped Sora Hashiba and Sunao Fujimori and had performed grotesque experiments on them when they were children. Aizawa has three "sons" whom are all clones by the names Nagase Kai, Cano, and Ren Shiina. Aizawa cannot also feel pain physically. Despite Aizawa being cold and collective, he is usually hyper and fun around Gaku Ichikawa and Nagase Kai. Aizawa deeply cares about the people around him, but due to his emotional disability, has issues showing so. Shin-ichirou's brother Ayano winds up working for him, claiming Aizawa was very depressed and lonely. Most of Aizawa's hate towards Nanami is mostly due to jealousy. By the end of the games, Aizawa redeems himself and happily works as a professor again, leaving the main characters alone. It's implied him and Ayano become a couple.

==Games==
Currently, there are four games and one spin-off in the ''Sukisho'' series. The games were originally point-and-click visual novels released for PC, containing sexual content, though certain body parts are censored (as is all pornographic material in Japan).

Three of the games have been released on the Sony [[PlayStation 2]]. The PS2 versions have been heavily edited and many new CG scenes have been added. In addition, they feature the voice acting from the Drama CD cast, which were absent in the PC release. These games do not yet have an official English translation.

===''First Limit''===
The first game in the series. Sora Hashiba was put into the hospital for quite some time after falling from one of the school buildings. He didn't receive any major injuries, but he has lost some of his memories in the process. However, he continually sees a vision of him being carried through several dark corridors and the voice of someone calling out to him. After being released from the hospital, Sora heads back to the dorms to find that a new boy by the name of Sunao Fujimori, who will now be his roommate. He is told that Sunao is his childhood friend, but he cannot recall spending his childhood with Sunao. As he spends time with Sunao, he notices some strange things about him, including his transformation into his alternate personality Ran. On top of that, the spirit of a hospitalized schoolmate possesses Sunao and confesses his love for him. Depending on the player's decisions, Sora can either end up with Sunao, Hiromu, Ran, or Minato.

===''Target Nights''===
After spending some time in Shin-ichirou and Nanami's place, Sora and Sunao come across a mysterious cosplaying bandit known only by the number 416. He claims that he has come to take away something precious from Sora. Meanwhile, Sora and Sunao meet Chris, who works at the nearby church. While he seems harmless, he begins to spend more time with Sora. To top it all off, Sora begins to realize that there are times when he and Sunao are mysteriously in bed together. He already knows about Sunao's connection with his alternate personality Ran, but could that mean he has his own alternate personality as well? Depending on the choices of the player, Sora will either end up with Sunao, Chris, Ran, Matsuri, or Minato. Also, obtaining all the CGs rewards the player with a special ending involving bandits 416, 773, and most recently 848.

===''Rain''===
Possibly the turning point in the series. Sora and Sunao continue their life in school. All seems normal until Sora notices a child that looks very similar to himself. Also, some of his schoolmates are beginning to act a little strange. Even Sora begins to notice that something odd about his connection to Sunao and the relationship between their alternate personalities Yoru and Ran. Depending on the choices of the player, Sora may end up with Sunao, Matsuri, Soushi, or Minato. Collecting all the CGs allows the player to access secret endings that involve Sora, Sunao, Matsuri, Shin-ichirou, and Nanami banding together as cosplaying bandits 848, 370, 332, 416, and 773.

''Sukisho'' cast's status prior to ''White Flower'':

*'''Sora:''' Working as a teacher in the nearby school (which is no longer an all-boys school).
*'''Sunao:''' Has been missing since ''Rain''. Said to be working for Aizawa.
*'''Matsuri:''' Working in an animal shelter (needs to be confirmed).
*'''Shin-ichirou:''' Has been missing since ''Rain''.
*'''Nanami:''' Still the school nurse
*'''Sei and Kitamura:''' Students in Sora's class
*'''Gaku:''' Still working with Nagase in the chemistry labs, but no longer as a student
*'''Nagase:''' Still chemistry lab manager
*'''Hiromu:''' Working as a model with Kirito Nakahara
*'''Chris:''' Still working at the nearby church
*'''Soushi:''' Still a lawyer.
*'''Professor Aizawa:''' Has been missing since ''Rain''. Said to have taken Sunao and Shin-ichirou with him.

===''White Flower''===
The final game in the series. Taking place a couple of years after ''Rain'', many changes have been made to the school. Not only is it no longer an all-boys school, several of the former students are now working as teachers while others move onto other jobs. Sora, as one of the teachers, has been living a fairly normal life as he takes Minato's place as teacher. However, he realizes that it won't stay normal for long when he sees that Sunao, who he has not seen since the events in ''Rain'', reappears in one of the halls. This game finally wraps up the story between Sora and Sunao and ends their conflict with Professor Aizawa. Depending on the player's choices, Sora can either end up with Sunao, Nanami, Hiromu, Matsuri, Soushi, or Minato. There are two hidden endings in this game. The Yoru/Ran ending is received when achieving the true ending, while the Kaito ending is obtained when all the CGs are collected.

===''Mou Matte''===
A spin off of the ''Sukisho'' games. Takes place some time in between ''Rain'' and ''White Flower''. The player now controls Gaku Ichikawa, one of Sora's friends who worked in the Chemistry Lab. Gaku must now choose whether to continue his relationship with Kai Nagase or start a new one with Ren Shiina. Depending on the player's choice, Gaku may end up with Shiina, Nagase, or Kitamura. Most of the main cast from the previous ''Sukisho'' games are visibly absent, including Sora and Sunao. Of the original cast, only Gaku, Nagase, Shiina, Kitamura, Nanami, Nakahara, and Hano make appearances.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8983">'''Termagant''' or '''Tervagant''' was the name given to a god which [[Christendom|Christians]] believed [[Islam|Muslims]] worshipped.&lt;ref name=OED2&gt;Definition from Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is also used in modern English to mean a violent, overbearing, turbulent, brawling, quarrelsome woman; a [[virago]], shrew, vixen.&lt;ref name=OED2/&gt; In the past, the word could be applied to any person or thing personified, not just a woman.

==Origin of the concept==
European literature from the [[Middle Ages]] often referred to Muslims as [[paganism|pagans]], with [[sobriquet]]s such as "the [[paynim]] foe". These depictions represent Muslims worshipping [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] as a god along with various deities in the form of [[Idolatry|idols]] ([[cult image]]s), ranging from [[Apollyon]] to [[Lucifer]], but their chief deity was typically named Termagant. In some writings, such as the eleventh-century ''[[Song of Roland]]'', this was combined to create an "unholy Trinity" of sorts composed of Muhammad, Apollyon, and Termagant.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Bolton Holloway, ''The Pilgrim and the Book: A Study of Dante, Langland, and Chaucer'', Peter Lang, New York, 1992, p.151&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the name Termagant is unknown, and does not seem to derive from any actual aspect of Muslim belief or practice, however wildly distorted. In the 19th century, [[W. W. Skeat]] speculated that the name was originally "Trivagante", meaning "thrice wandering", a reference to the moon, because of the Islamic use of crescent moon imagery. An [[Old English]] origin has also been suggested, from ''tiw mihtig r'' ("very mighty"), referring to the [[Germanic paganism|Germanic god]] [[Tyr|Tiw]]. Another possibility is that it derives from a confusion between Muslims and the [[Zoroastrian]] [[Magi]] of ancient [[Iran]]: thus ''tyr-magian'', or "Magian god". Joseph T. Shipley argues that it evolved from the Italian "Trivigante" and became confused with "{{wiktang|termigisto}}", meaning boaster, derived from [[Hermes Trismegistus]].&lt;ref name = "ship"/&gt;

It has been speculated that Tervagant may be a corruption of the [[Gauls|Gaulish]] god [[Tarvos Trigaranus|Taruos Tricaranos]].

==Termagant in literature==
Whatever its origins, "Termagant" became established in the West as the name of the principal Muslim god, being regularly mentioned in [[metrical romance]]s and ''[[chanson de geste|chansons de geste]]''. In the 15th-century Middle English romance ''[[Guy of Warwick|Syr Guy of Warwick]]'', a [[Sultan]] swears an oath:

:''So help me, [[Mahound|Mahoun]]e, of might,''
:''And Termagant, my god so bright.''

In the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'', the Muslims, having lost the battle of [[Roncesvalles]], desecrate their "pagan [[idolatry|idols]]" (lines 2589–90):
:''E Tervagan tolent sun escarbuncle, / E Mahumet enz en un fosset butent,''
:(''They strip the fire-red gem off Tervagant / And throw Mohammed down into a ditch...'')

Tervagant is also a god/statue of the "king of Africa" in the [[Jean Bodel]] play in [[Old French]] (c.1200) ''Le jeu de saint Nicolas''.

In the ''Sowdone of Babylone'', the [[sultan]] makes a vow to Termagaunte rather than [[Mahound]] (Muhammad)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = The Sultan of Babylon | editor = Alan Lupack | work = TEAMS Texts | publisher = Rochester | url = http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/sultfrm.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; (lines 135–40):
:''Of Babiloyne the riche Sowdon,''
:''Moost myghty man he was of moolde;''
:''He made a vowe to Termagaunte:''
:''Whan Rome were distroied and hade myschaunce,''
:''He woolde turne ayen erraunte''
:''And distroye Charles, the Kinge of Fraunce.''

In [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'', the "[[Chaucer's Tale of Sir Topas|Tale of Sir Thopas]]" (supposed to be told by Chaucer himself on the pilgrimage) is a parody of these [[Romance (heroic literature)|chivalric romances]]. In the tale, a [[giant (mythology)|giant]] [[knight]] named "Sir Oliphaunt" is made to swear an oath by Termagant.

In [[Occitan literature]] the name Muhammed was corrupted as "Bafomet", forming the basis for the legendary [[Baphomet]], at different times an idol, a "sabbatic goat", and key link in [[conspiracy theories]]. The troubadour [[Austorc d'Aorlhac]] refers to Bafomet and Termagant (''Tervagan'') side-by-side in one ''[[sirventes]]'', referring also to the latter's "companions".

It has been claimed that Termagant became a [[stock character]] in a number of [[medieval literature|medieval]] [[mystery play]]s&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Hibbard (ed), ''Hamlet'', Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whaley, Diana, "Voices from the Past: a Note on Termagant and Herod", Batchelor, J et al (ed), ''Shakespearian Continuities. Essays in honour of E.A.J. Honigman'', Houndmills: Macmillan, 23-39.&lt;/ref&gt; but another source denies this completely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/hamlet/examq/eighteen.html Mertins, Emma. Shakespeare Examinations.] Ed. William Taylor Thom, M. A. Boston: Ginn and Co., 1888. Shakespeare Online. Accessed 2017 Nov 21.&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[theatre|stage]], Termagant was usually depicted as a [[turban]]ned creature who wore a long, Eastern style [[gown]]. As a stage-[[villain]], he would rant at and threaten the lesser villains who were his servants and worshippers.

=="Termagant" as a ranting bully and a shrewish woman==
[[File:Rip Van Winkle scolded by his wife.jpg|thumb|Rip Van Winkle scolded by his "termagant wife", 1870 illustration by [[Sol Eytinge Jr.]]]] 
As a result of the theatrical tradition, by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] day the term had come to refer to a bullying person. ''[[Henry IV, part 1]]'' contains a reference to "that hot termagant Scot". In ''[[Hamlet]]'', the hero says of ham actors that "I would have such a fellow whipped for o'er-doing Termagant, it out-Herods Herod". [[Herod the Great|Herod]], like Termagant, was also a character from medieval drama who was famous for ranting. In similar vein [[Beaumont and Fletcher]]'s play ''[[A King and No King]]'' contains the line "This would make a saint swear like a soldier, and a soldier like Termagant."&lt;ref&gt;''The Works of Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher'', Volume: 1., George Bell and Sons &amp; A. H. Bullen, London, 1904, p.315&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainly because of Termagant's depiction in long gowns, and given that female roles were routinely played by male actors in Shakespearean times, English audiences got the mistaken notion that the character was female, or at least that he resembled a mannish woman.&lt;ref name = "ship"&gt;Joseph T. Shipley, ''Dictionary of Word Origins''. Edition: 2nd, Philosophical Library, New York, 1945, p.354&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the name "termagant" came increasingly to be applied to a woman with a quarrelsome, scolding quality, a sense that it retains today. This was a well established usage by the late 17th century. [[Thomas Shadwell]]'s play ''The Squire of Alsatia'' (1688) contains a character called Mrs Termagant who is out for revenge on one of the other characters, and is described as a "furious, malicious, and revengeful woman; perpetually plaguing him, and crossing him in all his designs; pursuing him continually with her malice, even to the attempting of his life."&lt;ref&gt;George Saintsbury, ''Thomas Shadwell'', T.F. Unwin, London, 1907, p.238&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Murphy (writer)|Arthur Murphy]]'s play ''The Upholsterer'' (1758) also contains a female character called "Termagant".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Murphy, ''The Way to Keep Him &amp; five other plays'', Vaillant, London, 1956, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Washington Irving]]'s "[[Rip Van Winkle]]", Dame Van Winkle is described as a "termagant wife". "[[Virago]]", "[[fishwife]]" and "[[wiktionary:shrew|shrew]]"  are near synonyms for "termagant" in this sense.

The term is still sometimes used of men. In 2008, the Australian politician [[Kim Beazley]] labelled opponent [[Tony Abbott]] a termagant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/obama-offers-hope-for-the-art-of-speechmaking/2008/01/20/1200764074900.html ''Obama offers hope for the art of speechmaking''], Stephanie Peatling, [[Sydney Morning Herald]], January 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Abyss''''' is a 1989 American [[science fiction film]] written and directed by [[James Cameron]], starring [[Ed Harris]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], and [[Michael Biehn]]. When an American [[submarine]] sinks in the Caribbean, the U.S. search and recovery team works with an [[oil platform]] crew, racing against Russian vessels to recover the boat. Deep in the ocean, they encounter something unexpected. The film was released on August 9, 1989, and grossed $90 million.  It won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and was nominated for three more Academy awards.

==Plot==
In 1988, the U.S. ''[[Ohio-class submarine|Ohio]]''-class submarine USS ''Montana'' has an encounter with an unidentified submerged object and sinks near the [[Cayman Trough]]. With Soviet ships moving in to try to salvage the sub and a [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]] moving over the area, the U.S. government sends a [[United States Navy SEALs|SEAL]] team to ''Deep Core'', a privately owned experimental underwater [[drilling platform]] near the Cayman Trough to use as a base of operations. The platform's designer, Dr. Lindsey Brigman, insists on going along with the SEAL team, despite her estranged husband Virgil "Bud" Brigman being the current foreman.

During initial investigation of the ''Montana'', a power outage in the team's submersibles leads to Lindsey seeing a strange light circling the sub, which she later calls a "non-terrestrial intelligence" or "NTI".  Lt. Coffey, the SEAL team leader, is ordered to accelerate their mission and takes one of the mini-subs without ''Deep Core''{{'}}s permission to recover a [[Trident (missile)|Trident missile]] warhead from the ''Montana'' just as the storm hits above. The ''Benthic Explorer'', to which ''Deep Core'' is tethered, is rocked by the storm, and the cable crane is torn from the ship. The crane falls into the trench and, without the mini-sub to disconnect the cable, ''Deep Core'' is dragged toward the trench, stopping just short of it. The rig is partially flooded, killing several crew members and damaging its power systems. Coffey shows little remorse when he and his SEALs return to the damaged base.

The crew wait out the storm so they can restore communications and be rescued. As they struggle against the cold, they find the NTIs have formed an animated column of water that is exploring the rig. Though they treat it with curiosity, Coffey is agitated by it and cuts it in half by closing a pressure bulkhead on it, causing it to retreat. Realizing that Coffey is suffering paranoia from [[high-pressure nervous syndrome]], the crew spies on him through a [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|remote operated vehicle]], finding him and another SEAL arming the warhead to attack the NTIs. To try and stop him, Bud fights Coffey but Coffey escapes in a mini-sub with the primed warhead; Bud and Lindsey give chase in the other sub, damaging both. Coffey is able to launch the warhead into the trench, but his sub drifts over the edge, crushing him when it implodes. Bud's mini-sub is inoperable and taking on water; with only one functional diving suit, Lindsey opts to enter deep hypothermia when the ocean's cold water engulfs her. Bud swims back to the platform with her body; there, he and the crew administer [[CPR]] and revive her, and Bud and Lindsey reaffirm their lost love.

One SEAL, unaware of Coffey's plan at the time, helps to locate the warhead, stopped on a ledge several thousand feet down the trench. Bud volunteers to use an experimental diving suit equipped with a [[liquid breathing]] apparatus to survive to that depth, though he will only be able to communicate through a keypad on the suit. Bud begins his dive, assisted by Lindsey's voice to keep him coherent against the effects of the mounting pressure, and reaches the warhead. The SEAL guides him in successfully disarming it. With little oxygen left in the system, Bud explains he knew it was a one-way trip, and tells Lindsey he loves her. As he waits for death, an NTI approaches Bud, takes his hand, and guides him to an alien ship deep in the trench. Inside the ship, the NTIs create an atmospheric pocket for Bud, allowing him to breathe normally. The NTIs then play back Bud's message to his wife and they look at each other with understanding.

On ''Deep Core'' the crew is waiting for rescue when they see a message from Bud that he met some friends and warns them to hold on. The base shakes and lights from the trench bring the arrival of the alien ship. It rises to the ocean's surface, with ''Deep Core'' and several of the surface ships run aground on its hull. The crew of ''Deep Core'' exit the platform, surprised they are not suffering from [[decompression sickness]]. They see Bud walking out of the alien ship and Lindsey races to hug him.

===Special Edition===
In the [[Director's cut#Extended cuts and special editions|extended version]], the events in the film are played against a backdrop of conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, with the potential for all-out war; the sinking of the ''Montana'' additionally fuels the aggression. There is more conflict between Bud and Lindsey in regards to their former relationship. The primary addition is the ending: when Bud is taken to the alien ship, they start by showing him images of war and aggression from news sources around the globe. The aliens then create massive [[megatsunami|megatsunamis]] that threaten the world's coasts, but stop them short before they hit. They then show Bud his message to Lindsey, and let the megatsunamis disperse without damage, as a warning to humanity.

==Production==
[[H. G. Wells]] was the first to introduce the notion of a sea alien in his 1897 short story "[[In the Abyss]]".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas C. Renzi. ''H.G. Wells: Six Scientific Romances Adapted for Film''. Scarecrow Press, 2004. 2nd ed. Pages 190-191.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for ''The Abyss'' came to [[James Cameron]] when, at age 17 and in high school, he attended a science lecture about deep sea diving by a man, Francis J. Falejczyk, who was the first human to breathe fluid through his lungs in experiments conducted by Johannes A. Kylstra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a037089.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924065653/http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a037089.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McLean"&gt;{{cite news | last = McLean | first = Phillip | coauthors = | title = Terror Strikes ''The Abyss'' | work = Sunday Mail | pages =| language = | publisher =  | date = August 27, 1989 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite news | last = Smith | first = Adam | coauthors = | title = Water Torture | work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | page = 106 | language = | publisher = | date = August 2001 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently wrote a short story&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite news | last = Walker | first = Beverly | coauthors = | title = Film Plot Mirrored Filmmakers' Troubles | work = [[Washington Times]] | pages = E1 | language = | publisher = | date = August 9, 1989 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; that focused on a group of scientists in a laboratory at the bottom of the ocean. The basic idea did not change, but many of the details evolved over the years. Once Cameron arrived in Hollywood, he quickly realized that a group of scientists was not that commercial and changed it to a group of blue-collar workers.&lt;ref name="Blair4"&gt;Blair September 1989, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; While making ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', Cameron saw a ''[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]'' film about remote operated vehicles operating deep in the North Atlantic Ocean. These images reminded him of his short story.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; He and producer [[Gale Anne Hurd]] decided that ''The Abyss'' would be their next film.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; Cameron wrote a treatment combined with elements of a shooting script, which generated a lot of interest in Hollywood. He then wrote the script, basing the character of Lindsey on Hurd and finished it by the end of 1987.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; Cameron and Hurd were married before ''The Abyss'', separated during pre-production, and divorced in February 1989, two months after principal photography.&lt;ref name="Harmetz"&gt;{{cite news | last = Harmetz | first = Aljean | coauthors =  | title = A Foray into Deep Waters | work = [[New York Times]] | page = 15 | language =  | publisher =  | date = August 6, 1989 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/movies/film-the-abyss-a-foray-into-deep-waters.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | accessdate = 2009-08-14 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101027195842/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/movies/film-the-abyss-a-foray-into-deep-waters.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | archivedate = October 27, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cast and crew trained for underwater diving for one week in the [[Cayman Islands]].&lt;ref name="Blair"&gt;{{cite news | last = Blair | first = Ian | coauthors = | title = Underwater in ''The Abyss'' | work = [[Starlog]] | page = 38 | language = | publisher = | date = September 1989 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was necessary because 40% of all live-action principal photography took place underwater. Furthermore, Cameron's production company had to design and build experimental equipment and develop a state-of-the-art communications system that allowed the director to talk underwater to the actors and dialogue to be recorded directly onto tape for the first time.&lt;ref name="Blair3"&gt;Blair September 1989, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameron had originally planned to shoot on location in the [[Bahamas]] where the story was set but quickly realized that he needed to have a completely controlled environment because of the stunts and special visual effects involved.&lt;ref name="Blair3"/&gt; He considered shooting the film in [[Malta]], which had the largest unfiltered tank of water, but it was not adequate for Cameron's needs.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; Underwater sequences for the film were shot at a unit of the [[Earl Owensby Studios|Gaffney Studios]], situated south of [[Cherokee Falls, South Carolina|Cherokee Falls]], outside [[Gaffney, South Carolina]], which had been abandoned by [[Duke Power]] officials after previously spending $700 million constructing the [[Cherokee Nuclear Power Plant]], along Owensby Street, Gaffney, South Carolina.&lt;ref name="Blair"/&gt;

Two specially constructed tanks were used. The first one, based on the abandoned plant's primary reactor containment vessel, held {{convert|7.5|e6USgal|m3}} of water, was 55 feet (18 m) deep and 209 feet (70 m) across. At the time, it was the largest fresh-water filtered tank in the world. Additional scenes were shot in the second tank, an unused turbine pit, which held {{convert|2.5|e6USgal|m3}} of water.&lt;ref name="Blair3"/&gt; As the production crew rushed to finish painting the main tank, millions of gallons of water poured in and took five days to fill.&lt;ref name="Smith2"&gt;Smith August 2001, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The Deepcore rig was anchored to a 90-ton concrete column at the bottom of the large tank. It consisted of six partial and complete modules that took over half a year to plan and build from scratch.&lt;ref name="Blair5"&gt;Blair September 1989, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Can-Dive Services Ltd., a Canadian commercial diving company that specialized in [[saturation diving]] systems and underwater technology, specially manufactured the two working craft (Flatbed and Cab One) for the film. Two million dollars was spent on set construction.&lt;ref name="Blair4"/&gt;

Filming was also done at the largest underground lake in the world—a mine in [[Bonne Terre, Missouri]], which was the background for several underwater shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonneterrebiz.com/items/attractions/bonne-terre-mine-tour/|title=Mid America Web Multisite|work=bonneterrebiz.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528182328/http://www.bonneterrebiz.com/items/attractions/bonne-terre-mine-tour/|archivedate=2013-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countryhomesofmissouri.com/city/detail/?id=2680|title=City Data for Bonne Terre, Missouri|work=countryhomesofmissouri.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principal photography===
The main tank was not ready in time for the first day of principal photography. Cameron delayed filming for a week and pushed the smaller tank's schedule forward, demanding that it be ready weeks ahead of schedule.&lt;ref name="Smith2"/&gt; Filming eventually began on August 15, 1988, but there were still problems. On the first day of shooting in the main water tank, it sprang a leak and {{convert|150,000|USgal|m3}} of water a minute rushed out.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; The studio brought in dam-repair experts to seal it. In addition, enormous pipes with elbow fittings had been improperly installed. There was so much water pressure in them that the elbows blew off.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;

Cameron's choice of cinematographer on the movie was [[Mikael Salomon]]—a US-based Danish national who would go on to work on other blockbusters such as ''[[Backdraft (film)|Backdraft]]'' and ''[[Arachnophobia (film)|Arachnophobia]]'' before moving into the director's slot on a myriad of films and TV shows including two editions of the acclaimed [[HBO]] WW2 series ''[[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]''. Salomon used three cameras in watertight housings that were specially designed.&lt;ref name="Blair5"/&gt; Another special housing was designed for scenes that went from above-water dialogue to below-water dialogue. The filmmakers had to figure out how to keep the water clear enough to shoot and dark enough to look realistic at 2,000 feet (700 m), which was achieved by floating a thick layer of plastic beads in the water and covering the top of the tank with an enormous [[tarpaulin]].&lt;ref name="Blair5"/&gt; Cameron wanted to see the actors' faces and hear their dialogue, and thus hired Western Space and Marine to engineer helmets which would remain optically clear underwater and installed state-of-the-art aircraft quality microphones into each helmet. Safety conditions were also a major factor with the installation of a decompression chamber on site, along with a diving bell and a safety diver for each actor.&lt;ref name="Blair5"/&gt;

The [[liquid breathing|breathing fluid]] used in the film actually exists but has only been thoroughly investigated in animals.&lt;ref name=kylstra&gt;{{cite book |title=The Feasibility of Liquid Breathing in Man. |author=Kylstra JA |year=1977 |volume=Report to the US Office of Naval Research |publisher=Duke University |location=Durham, NC |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4257 |accessdate=2008-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707005721/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4257 |archivedate=2008-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the previous 20 years it had been tested on several animals, who survived. The rat shown in the film was actually breathing fluid and survived unharmed.&lt;ref&gt;ALJEAN HARMETZ; [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0D7133DF935A3575BC0A96F948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all FILM; 'The Abyss': A Foray Into Deep Waters] - The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

Ed Harris did not actually breathe the fluid. He held his breath inside a helmet full of liquid while being towed 30 feet (10 m) below the surface of the large tank. He recalled that the worst moments were being towed with fluid rushing up his nose and his eyes swelling up.&lt;ref name="Harmetz"/&gt; Actors played their scenes at 33 feet (11 m), too shallow a depth for them to need decompression, and rarely stayed down for more than an hour at a time. Cameron and the 26-person underwater diving crew sank to 50 feet (17 m) and stayed down for five hours at a time. To avoid decompression sickness, they would have to hang from hoses halfway up the tank for as long as two hours, breathing pure oxygen.&lt;ref name="Harmetz"/&gt;

The cast and crew endured over six months of grueling six-day, 70-hour weeks on an isolated set. At one point, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio had a physical and emotional breakdown on the set and on another occasion, Ed Harris burst into spontaneous sobbing while driving home. Cameron himself admitted, "I knew this was going to be a hard shoot, but even I had no idea just how hard. I don't ''ever'' want to go through this again".&lt;ref name="Blair4"/&gt; For example, for the scene where portions of the rig are flooded with water, he realized that he initially did not know how to minimize the sequence's inherent danger. It took him more than four hours to set up the shot safely.&lt;ref name="Harmetz"/&gt; Actor Leo Burmester said, "Shooting ''The Abyss'' has been the hardest thing I've ever done. Jim Cameron is the type of director who pushes you to the edge, but he doesn't make you do anything he wouldn't do himself."&lt;ref name="Blair"/&gt; A lightning storm caused a 200-foot (65 m) tear in the black tarpaulin covering the main tank.&lt;ref name="Smith2"/&gt; Repairing it would have taken too much time, so the production began shooting at night.&lt;ref name="Smith3"&gt;Smith August 2001, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, blooming algae often reduced visibility to 20 feet (6 m) within hours. Over-chlorination led to divers' skin burning and exposed hair being stripped off or turning white.&lt;ref name="Smith3"/&gt;

As production went on, the slow pace and daily mental and physical strain of filming began to wear on the cast and crew. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio remembered, "We never started and finished any one scene in any one day".&lt;ref name="Harmetz"/&gt; At one point, Cameron told the actors to relieve themselves in their wetsuits to save time between takes.&lt;ref name="Smith3"/&gt; While filming one of many takes of Mastrantonio's character's resuscitation scene—in which she was soaking wet, topless and repeatedly being slapped and pounded on the chest—the camera ran out of film, prompting Mastrantonio to storm off the set yelling, "We are not animals!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hibberd|first=James|title=Ed Harris discusses his 9 best movie roles|date=29 November 2016|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|url=http://ew.com/article/2016/11/29/ed-harris-movies/|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For some shots in the scene that focus on Ed Harris, he was yelling at thin air because Mastrantonio refused to film the scene again. Michael Biehn also grew frustrated by the waiting. He claimed that he was in South Carolina for five months and only acted for three to four weeks.&lt;ref name="Harmetz"/&gt; He remembered one day being ten meters underwater and "suddenly the lights went out. It was so black I couldn't see my hand. I couldn't surface. I realized I might not get out of there." Harris recalled: "One day we were all in our dressing rooms and people began throwing couches out the windows and smashing the walls. We just had to get our frustrations out."&lt;ref name="McLean"/&gt; Cameron responded to these complaints, saying, "For every hour they spent trying to figure out what magazine to read, we spent an hour at the bottom of the tank breathing compressed air."&lt;ref name="Harmetz"/&gt; After 140 days and $4 million over budget, filming finally wrapped on December 8, 1988.&lt;ref name="Smith3"/&gt; Before the film's release, there were reports from South Carolina that Ed Harris was so upset by the physical demands of the film and Cameron's dictatorial directing style that he said he would refuse to help promote the motion picture. Harris later denied this rumor and helped promote the film.&lt;ref name="Harmetz"/&gt; But after its release and initial promotion, Harris publicly disowned the film, saying "I'm never talking about it and never will." Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio also disowned the film, saying, "''The Abyss'' was a lot of things. Fun to make is not one of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/trivia_abyss.htm|title=The Abyss Movie Trivia - The 80s Movies Rewind|work=fast-rewind.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017134303/http://www.fast-rewind.com/trivia_abyss.htm|archivedate=2013-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-production===
To create the alien water tentacle, Cameron initially considered [[Traditional animation#cels|cel animation]] or a tentacle sculpted in clay and then animated via stop-motion techniques with water reflections projected onto it. [[Phil Tippett]] suggested Cameron contact [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]].&lt;ref name="Smith2"/&gt; The special visual effects work was divided up among seven FX divisions with motion control work by Dream Quest Images and computer graphics and opticals by ILM.&lt;ref name="Blair4"/&gt; ILM designed a program to produce surface waves of differing sizes and kinetic properties for the pseudopod.&lt;ref name="Smith2"/&gt; For the moment where it mimics Bud and Lindsey's faces, Ed Harris had eight of his facial expressions scanned while twelve of Mastrantonio's were scanned via software used to create computer-generated sculptures. The set was photographed from every angle and digitally recreated so that the pseudopod could be accurately composited into the live-action footage.&lt;ref name="Smith2"/&gt; The company spent six months to create 75 seconds of computer graphics needed for the creature. The film was to have opened on July 4, 1989, but its release was delayed for more than a month by production and special effects problems.&lt;ref name="Harmetz"/&gt; The animated sequences were supervised by ILM animation director [[Wes Takahashi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agni-animation.com/fullerton/halloffame/Wes_Ford_Takahashi.html|title=Subject: Wes Ford Takahashi|publisher=Animators' Hall of Fame|access-date=14 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812020742/http://www.agni-animation.com/fullerton/halloffame/Wes_Ford_Takahashi.html|archivedate=12 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studio executives were nervous about the film's commercial prospects when preview audiences laughed at scenes of serious intent. Industry insiders said that the release delay was because nervous executives ordered the film's ending completely re-shot. There was also the question of the size of the film's budget: 20th Century Fox stated that the budget was $43 million,&lt;ref name="Harmetz (19898-6)"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Harmetz |first=Aljean |date=August 6, 1989 |title=FILM; 'The Abyss': A Foray Into Deep Waters |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/movies/film-the-abyss-a-foray-into-deep-waters.html |accessdate=February 2, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501171439/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/movies/film-the-abyss-a-foray-into-deep-waters.html |archivedate=May 1, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a figure Cameron himself has reiterated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFiTfc5cxZA|title=08-09-1989 Letterman Sam Kinison, James Cameron|date=13 July 2014|work=YouTube|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904044138/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFiTfc5cxZA|archivedate=4 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, estimates put the figure higher with ''[[The New York Times]]'' estimating the cost at $45 million&lt;ref name="Greenberg (1991)"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Greenburg |first=James |title=FILM; Why the 'Hudson Hawk' Budget Soared So High |date=May 26, 1991 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/26/movies/film-why-the-hudson-hawk-budget-soared-so-high.html?pagewanted=3 |accessdate=February 2, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812135130/http://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/26/movies/film-why-the-hudson-hawk-budget-soared-so-high.html?pagewanted=3 |archivedate=August 12, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one executive claiming it cost $47 million,&lt;ref name="Sujo"&gt;{{cite news | last = Sujo | first = Aly | coauthors = | title = ''Abyss'' Puts Studio Executives on Edge | work = [[The Globe and Mail]] | pages = | language = | publisher =  | date = August 8, 1989 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; while box office revenue tracker website ''The Numbers'' lists the production budget at $70 million.&lt;ref name="thenumbers"&gt;[http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1989/0ABYS.php The Abyss budget/box office details] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017120609/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1989/0ABYS.php |date=2009-10-17 }} at The-Numbers.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
''The Abyss'' was released on August 9, 1989, in 1,533 theaters, where it grossed $9.3 million on its opening weekend and ranked #2 at the box office. It went on to make $54.5 million in North America and $35.5 million throughout the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $90 million.&lt;ref name="mojo"&gt;{{cite news| last =| first =| coauthors =| title =''The Abyss''| work =[[Box Office Mojo]]| pages =| language =| publisher =| date =| url =http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=abyss.htm| accessdate =2009-03-08| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090303060955/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=abyss.htm| archivedate =2009-03-03| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], ''The Abyss'' has an 89% approval rating based on 44 reviews and an average rating of 7.2/10. The critical consensus states: "The utterly gorgeous special effects frequently overshadow the fact that ''The Abyss'' is also a totally gripping, claustrophobic thriller, complete with an interesting crew of characters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/abyss/ |title = The Abyss (1989) |accessdate = 2010-07-05 |publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100705145824/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/abyss/ |archivedate = 2010-07-05 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has an average score of 62 out of 100, based on 14 critics indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-abyss |title=''The Abyss'' |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=2010-07-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501143608/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-abyss |archivedate=2011-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviews tallied therein are for both the theatrical release and the Special Edition.

''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine's [[David Ansen]], summarizing the theatrical release, wrote, "The payoff to ''The Abyss'' is pretty damn silly — a portentous ''[[deus ex machina]]'' that leaves too many questions unanswered and evokes too many other films."&lt;ref name="Ansen"&gt;{{cite news | last = Ansen | first = David | coauthors = | title = Under Fire, Underwater | work = [[Newsweek]] | page =56  | language = | publisher =  | date = August 14, 1989 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Caryn James claimed that the film had "at least four endings," and "by the time the last ending of this two-and-a-quarter-hour film comes along, the effect is like getting off a demon roller coaster that has kept racing several laps after you were ready to get off."&lt;ref name="james"&gt;{{cite news | last = James | first = Caryn | coauthors = | title = Undersea Life and Peril | work = [[New York Times]] | page = 13 | language = | publisher =  | date = August 9, 1989 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Dafoe, in his review for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', wrote, "At its best, ''The Abyss'' offers a harrowing, thrilling journey through inky waters and high tension. In the end, however, this torpedo turns out to be a dud—it swerves at the last minute, missing its target and exploding ineffectually in a flash of fantasy and fairy-tale schtick."&lt;ref name="dafoe"&gt;{{cite news | last =Dafoe | first = Chris | coauthors = | title = Big Leak in Underwater Adventure | work = [[The Globe and Mail]] | pages = | language = | publisher =  | date = August 9, 1989 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While praising the film's first two hours as "compelling", the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' remarked, "But when Cameron takes the adventure to the next step, deep into the heart of fantasy, it all becomes one great big deja boo. If we are to believe what Cameron finds way down there, E.T. didn't really phone home, he went surfing and fell off his board."&lt;ref&gt;''Toronto Star'', October 9, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, "Most of this underwater blockbuster is 'good,' and at least two action set pieces are great. But the dopey wrap-up sinks the rest 20,000 leagues."&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{cite news | last = Clark | first = Mike | coauthors = | title = ''The Abyss'' Gets in Deep - For Good and Bad | work = [[USA Today]] | pages = 1D | language = | publisher =  | date = August 9, 1989 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her review for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Rita Kempley wrote that the film "asks us to believe that the drowned return to life, that the comatose come to the rescue, that driven women become doting wives, that Neptune cares about landlubbers. I'd sooner believe that Moby Dick could swim up the drainpipe."&lt;ref name="kempley"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kempley | first = Rita | coauthors = | title = Saturated Sci-Fi | work = [[Washington Post]] | pages = C1 | language = | publisher =  | date = August 9, 1989 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Halliwell's Film Guide]]'' claimed the film was "despite some clever special effects, a tedious, overlong fantasy that is more excited by machinery than people."&lt;ref&gt;''Halliwell's Film Guide'', 13th edition - {{ISBN|0-00-638868-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's [[Peter Travers]] enthused, "[''The Abyss'' is] the greatest underwater adventure ever filmed, the most consistently enthralling of the summer blockbusters…one of the best pictures of the year."&lt;ref name="travers"&gt;{{cite news|last=Travers |first=Peter |coauthors= |title=''The Abyss'' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |pages= |language= |publisher= |date=August 24, 1989 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5947965/review/5947966/the_abyss |accessdate=2009-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081130010901/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5947965/review/5947966/the_abyss |archivedate=November 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of the Special Edition in 1993 garnered much praise. Each giving it thumbs up, Siskel remarked, "''The Abyss'' has been improved," and Ebert added, "It makes the film seem more well rounded."&lt;ref&gt;See linked review below...&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''Reel Views 2'', [[James Berardinelli]] comments, "James Cameron's ''The Abyss'' may be the most extreme example of an available movie that demonstrates how the vision of a director, once fully realized on screen, can transform a good motion picture into a great one."&lt;ref&gt;Reel Views 2: The Ultimate Guide to the Best 1,000 Modern Movies on DVD and Video By James Berardinelli, page 582&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Special Edition==
Even as the film was in the first weeks of its 1989 theatrical release, rumors were circulating of a wave sequence missing from the film's end. As chronicled in the 1993 [[LaserDisc]] Special Edition release and later in the 2000 DVD, the pressure to cut the film's running time stemmed from both distribution concerns and [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]]'s then-inability to complete the required sequences. From the distributor's perspective, the looming three-hour length limited the number of times the film could be shown each day, assuming that audiences would be willing to sit through the entire film, though 1990's ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' would shatter both industry-held notions. Further, test audience screenings revealed a surprisingly mixed reaction to the sequences as they appeared in their unfinished form; in post-screening surveys, they dominated both the "Scenes I liked most" and "Scenes I liked least" fields. Contrary to speculation, studio meddling was not the cause of the shortened length; Cameron held final cut as long as the film met a running time of roughly two hours and 15 minutes. He later noted, "Ironically, the studio brass were horrified when I said I was cutting the wave."&lt;ref&gt;''The Abyss Special Edition DVD, The Restoration''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What emerges in the winnowing process is only the best stuff. And I think the overall caliber of the film is improved by that. I cut only two minutes of ''Terminator''. On ''Aliens'', we took out much more. I even reconstituted some of that in a special (TV) release version.

The sense of something being missing on ''Aliens'' was greater for me than on ''The Abyss'', where the film just got consistently better as the cut got along. The film must function as a dramatic, organic whole. When I cut the film together, things that read well on paper, on a conceptual level, didn't necessarily translate to the screen as well. I felt I was losing something by breaking my focus. Breaking the story's focus and coming off the main characters was a far greater detriment to the film than what was gained. The film keeps the same message intact at a thematic level, not at a really overt level, by working in a symbolic way.&lt;ref name="starlog"&gt;''[[Starlog]]'', Issue 150, interview by Ian Spelling&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:8.23.12BiehnBlancByLuigiNovi17.jpg|thumb|Star [[Michael Biehn]] signing a copy of the film's DVD cover during an August 23, 2012, appearance at [[Midtown Comics]] in Manhattan.]]
Cameron elected to remove the sequences along with other, shorter scenes elsewhere in the film, reducing the running time from roughly two hours and 50 minutes to two hours and 20 minutes and diminishing his signature themes of nuclear peril and disarmament. Subsequent test audience screenings drew substantially better reactions.

Star Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio publicly expressed regret about some of the scenes selected for removal from the film's theatrical cut: "There were some beautiful scenes that were taken out. I just wish we hadn't shot so much that isn't in the film."&lt;ref name="starlog" /&gt;

Shortly after the film's premiere, Cameron and video editor Ed Marsh created a longer video cut of ''The Abyss'' for their own use that incorporated [[dailies]]. With the tremendous success of Cameron's ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' in 1991, [[Lightstorm Entertainment]] secured a five-year, $500 million financing deal with 20th Century Fox for films produced, directed or written by Cameron.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/22/movies/fox-locks-in-cameron-with-a-5-year-deal-worth-500-million.html Fox Locks In Cameron With a 5-Year Deal Worth $500 Million] from [[The New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt; The contract allocated roughly $500,000 of the amount to complete ''The Abyss''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Toronto Star'', ''Starweek Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt; ILM was commissioned to finish the work they had started three years earlier, with many of the same people who had worked on it originally.

The [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] tools developed for ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' allowed ILM to complete the rumored [[tsunami|tidal wave]] sequence, as well as correcting flaws in rendering for all their other work done for the film.

The tidal wave sequence had originally been designed by ILM as a physical effect, using a plastic wave, but Cameron was dissatisfied with the end result, and the sequence was scrapped. By the time Cameron was ready to revisit ''The Abyss'', ILM's CGI prowess had finally progressed to an appropriate level, and the wave was rendered as a CGI effect. ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' screenwriter and frequent Cameron collaborator [[William Wisher Jr.|William Wisher]] had a cameo in the scene as a reporter in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] who catches the first tidal wave on camera.

When it was discovered that original production sound recordings had been lost, new [[dialogue]] and [[Foley artist|foley]] were recorded, but since Kidd Brewer had died of a self-inflicted gunshot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kidd Brewer Jr. found dead at home|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19900524&amp;id=wg8yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-BMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5946,3479841|accessdate=28 December 2014|work=Wilmington Morning Star|date=May 24, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; before he could return to re-loop his dialog, producers and editors had to lift his original dialogue tracks from the remaining optical-sound prints of the [[dailies]]. The Special Edition was therefore dedicated to his memory as a result.

As [[Alan Silvestri]] was not available to compose new music for the restored scenes, Robert Garrett, who had composed temporary music for the film's initial cutting in 1989, was chosen to create new music. The Special Edition was completed in December 1992, with 28 minutes added to the film, and saw a limited theatrical release in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] on February 26, 1993 (the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]] occurred on that day), and expanded to key cities nationwide in the following weeks.

The first THX-certified LaserDisc title of the Special Edition Box Set was released in May 1993 and was a best-seller for the rest of the year.  The Special Edition was released on VHS in 1996 as a part of Fox Video's Widescreen Series with a seven minute behind-the-scenes featurette with footage that did not appear in the ''Under Pressure: The Making of The Abyss'' documentary that was included on the Laserdisc and DVD releases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_90dUwSmqD0 from VHS Preview from "The Abyss: Special Edition" (1996) [Widescreen Release]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Special Edition's first DVD release in 2000 was on two discs and featured animated menus&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZjFdwDz5mo] from Opening To The Abyss 2000 DVD]&lt;/ref&gt;, both the theatrical and Special Edition versions of the film along with the Laserdisc's extensive text, artwork and photographic documentation of the film's production, a ten minute featurette and the sixty minute documentary ''Under Pressure: The Making of The Abyss.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://originaltrilogy.com/topic/The-Abyss-Special-Edition-1989-BluRay-Project-BD-50-x2-DELETED/id/16302 from The Abyss: Special Edition Review by Robert Wederquist]&lt;/ref&gt; All available DVDs are non-anamorphic with the exception of the Chinese DVD produced for Region 6 by Excel Media.

In 2014 the pay cable channels [[Cinemax]] and [[HBO]] began broadcasting both versions of the film in 1080p.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avsforum.com/forum/34-hdtv-programming/1525963-abyss-max-hd-2-4-ratio.html from The Abyss on Max in HD 2.4 ratio]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://filmboards.com/board/p/17353/latest/ from The Abyss Ever Going to Be Released?]&lt;/ref&gt;  Both broadcasts began circulating amongst [[online piracy]] communities shortly thereafter.  [[Netflix]]'s UK service began offering the theatrical version in 1080p in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.avforums.com/threads/the-abyss-now-on-netflix-in-hd.2128578/ from The Abyss now on Netflix in HD]&lt;/ref&gt;  At an October, 2014 event James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd were asked about a future blu-ray release for the film.  Cameron gestured to the head of Fox Home Entertainment, implying the decision lay with the studio.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thedigitalbits.com/columns/my-two-cents/101614_1115 from Criterion’s January includes Sword of Doom &amp; more, plus Majestic stand-alone BD &amp; yet another Abyss/True Lies non-update]&lt;/ref&gt;  Five months later another article suggested a spat between Cameron and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment was responsible for the delay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thedigitalbits.com/columns/my-two-cents/032515_1415 from 1776: Director’s Cut coming to BD, plus Strange Days: 20th (in Germany), a Giger documentary &amp; Kubrick’s Spartacus!]&lt;/ref&gt;  While promoting the upcoming 30th-anniversary [[Blu-ray]] release of Aliens at Comic-Con in San Diego July 2016 James Cameron confirmed that he was working on a remastered 4K transfer of ''The Abyss'' and that it would be released on Blu-ray for the first time in early 2017.  Cameron added, "We've done a [[Wet-transfer film gate|wet-gate]] 4K scan of the original negative, and it's going to look insanely good. We're going to do an authoring pass in the DI for Blu-ray and HDR at the same time."&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2016/film/news/james-cameron-on-why-avatar-needs-three-sequels-and-details-on-an-abyss-blu-ray-release-1201821558/ James Cameron On Why ‘Avatar’ Needs Three Sequels and Details on an ‘Abyss’ Blu-ray Release] from [[Variety_magazine]]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is unclear if this new scan is the one used to create the 1080p broadcasts.

It is unknown whether both the theatrical and special-edition versions will be included. As of 2018, the Blu-ray is yet to be released.

==Adaptations==
Science-fiction author [[Orson Scott Card]] was hired to write a [[novelization]] of the film based on the screenplay and discussions with Cameron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Books By Orson Scott Card - The Abyss|url=http://www.hatrack.com/osc/books/abyss.shtml|accessdate=16 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116135053/http://www.hatrack.com/osc/books/abyss.shtml|archivedate=16 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote back-stories for Bud, Lindsey, and Coffey as a means not only of helping the actors define their roles, but also to justify some of their behavior and mannerisms in the film. Card also wrote the aliens as a colonizing species which preferentially sought high-pressure deep-water worlds to build their ships as they traveled further into the galaxy (their mothership was in orbit on the far side of the moon). The NTIs' knowledge of neuroanatomy and nanoscale manipulation of biochemistry was responsible for many of the ''[[deus ex machina]]'' aspects of the film.

A licensed [[interactive fiction]] video game based on the script was being developed for [[Infocom]] by [[Bob Bates]], but was cancelled when Infocom was shut down by its then-parent company [[Activision]].&lt;ref name="ACG"&gt;[http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/interviews/168 Bob Bates interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204141859/http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/interviews/168/ |date=2012-02-04 }} at Adventure Classic Gaming&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sound Source Interactive]] later created an action video game entitled ''The Abyss: Incident at Europa''. The game takes place a few years after the film, where the player must find a cure for a deadly virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Abyss: Incident at Europa for Windows (1998) - MobyGames |work=[[MobyGames]] |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/abyss-incident-at-europa |accessdate=2012-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219074942/http://www.mobygames.com/game/abyss-incident-at-europa |archivedate=2012-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''V.''''' is the debut [[novel]] of [[Thomas Pynchon]], published in 1963. It describes the exploits of a discharged [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] sailor named Benny Profane, his reconnection in [[New York City|New York]] with a group of pseudo-[[bohemianism|bohemian]] artists and hangers-on known as the Whole Sick Crew, and the quest of an aging traveler named Herbert Stencil to identify and locate the mysterious entity he knows only as "V." It was nominated for a [[National Book Award]].

==Plot summary==
The novel alternates between episodes featuring Benny, Stencil and other members of the Whole Sick Crew (including Profane's sidekick [[Pig Bodine]]) in 1956 (with a few minor flashbacks), and a generation-spanning plot that comprises Stencil's attempts to unravel the clues he believes will lead him to "V." (or to the various incarnations thereof). Each of these "Stencilised" chapters is set at a different moment of [[international crisis|historical crisis]]; the framing narrative involving Stencil, "V.", and the [[Diary|journals]] of Stencil's [[United Kingdom|British]] spy/diplomat father threads the sequences together. The novel's two storylines increasingly converge in the last chapters (the intersecting lines forming a V-shape, as it were), as Stencil hires Benny to travel with him to [[Malta]].

===Chapter One: "In which Benny Profane, a schlemil and human yo-yo, gets to an apocheir"===
The opening chapter is set in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] [[Christmas Eve]], 1955. Benny Profane, a recently discharged seaman, is at a local sailor bar called the "Sailor's Grave" in which every waitress is named Beatrice and the beer taps are rubber model breasts that the sailors suck on. Here Profane meets Ploy, a short violent sailor, his musician friend Dewey Gland, and the Maltese barmaid Paola Hod. Bar owner Mrs. Buffo begins to play a rendition of [[It Came Upon the Midnight Clear]] to celebrate Christmas only to be immediately assaulted by Ploy and the rest of the intoxicated sailors. The disorder triggers a raid by the military police. Pig Bodine, Paola, Dewey Gland and Profane escape the chaos to Pig's apartment.

===Chapter Two: "The Whole Sick Crew"===
The chapter opens with Rachel Owlglass confronting the plastic surgeon Shale Schoenmaker who she accuses of manipulating her friend and roommate Esther Havitz into debt through repeated rhinoplasty. Schoenmaker responds by entering into a monologue on the nature of Jewish women and the nature of appearance.

Section II is set during a party at Rachel's apartment attended by the "Sick Crew", Paola, Esther, and Debb. This section introduces the character Herbert Stencil, a troubled man who is obsessed with his father's mysterious death in Malta and the identity of "V", a woman mentioned in his father's journal.

===Chapter Three: "In which Stencil, a quick-change artist does eight impersonations"===
This chapter, set among the British community in [[Egypt]] toward the end of the 19th century, consists of an introduction and a series of eight relatively short sections, each of them from the point of view of a different person. The eight sections come together to tell a story of murder and intrigue, intersecting the life of a young woman, Victoria Wren, the first incarnation of V. The title is a hint as to how this chapter is to be understood: Stencil imagines each of the eight viewpoints as he reconstructs&amp;mdash;we do not know on how much knowledge and how much conjecture&amp;mdash;this episode. This chapter is a reworking of Pynchon's short story "Under the Rose", which was first published in [[1961 in literature|1961]] and is collected in ''[[Slow Learner]]'' ([[1984 in literature|1984]]). In the ''Slow Learner'' introduction, Pynchon admits he took the details of the setting ("right down to the names of the diplomatic corps") from [[Karl Baedeker]]'s 1899 travel guide for Egypt. Stencil's reconstruction follows the same basic conflict as "Under the Rose", but it gives the non-European characters much more personality.

===Chapter Four: In Which Esther Gets a Nose Job===
Section I details the history of Shale Schoenmaker, M.D. and how he began his career as a plastic surgeon. During [[World War One]] he eagerly enlists in the [[American Expeditionary Forces|A.E.F.]] hoping to become a pilot but, is instead given a position as an engineer. While serving he witnesses Evan Godolphin, a handsome pilot whom he idealized, become horribly disfigured during an air raid. A month later Schoenmaker visits Godolphin in the hospital while he is recovering from reconstructive surgery, discovering that an incompetent surgeon, Halidom, treated him using the archaic method that would inevitably lead to further disfigurement by infection. This event traumatizes Schoenmaker, causing him to now see it as his mission to help people like Godolphin, a conviction that slowly decays over time.

===Chapter Five: In Which Stencil Nearly Goes West with an Alligator===
Only marginally part of the Stencil/V. material, this chapter follows Benny and others, as Benny has a job hunting [[Sewer alligator|alligators in the sewers]] under [[Manhattan]]. It figures in the Stencil/V. story in that there is a rat named "Veronica" who figures in a subplot about a mad priest — Father Linus Fairing, [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]] — some decades back, living in the sewers and preaching to the rats; we hear from him in the form of his diary. Stencil himself makes a brief appearance toward the end of the chapter.

===Chapter Six: In which Profane returns to street level===
The chapter follows Profane, Geronimo, Angel, and his sister Josephine "Fina" into the city over several nights of drinking. Fina and Profane's relationship develops amid concerns over her status within a local mercenary street gang known as the Playboys, who see her as a spiritual figurehead. The chapter ends amid a massive brawl, nearby which Fina is found lying naked and smiling.

===Chapter Seven: She hangs on the western wall===
In [[Florence]] in 1899, Victoria appears again, briefly, but so does the place name "Vheissu", which may or may not stand for [[Vesuvius]], [[Venezuela]], a crude interpretation of ''wie heißt du'', translating into ''who are you'' in the German language, or even (one character jokes) [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]. The chapter also revolves around an attempted burglary of Botticelli's ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' by Hugh Godolphin through the Venezuelan consulate.

===Chapter Eight: In which Rachel gets her yo-yo back, Roony sings a song, and Stencil calls on Bloody Chiclitz===
The chapter begins with Benny Profane, freshly unemployed after being laid-off from sewer-alligator hunting, in search of a job in Manhattan. After briefly contemplating the nature of money on a park bench, he, by chance, looks at an advertisement issued by The Time/Space Employment Agency. Once arriving at the agency he finds, much to his annoyance, that the secretary is his former lover Rachel Owlglass. In section IV Stencil continues his investigation of the perplexing "V." (whom he now believes is either Victoria or the rat Veronica) meeting up with a Yoyodyne engineer Kurt Mondaugen.

===Chapter Nine: Mondaugen's story===
Kurt Mondaugen, who will appear again in ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', is the central character in a story set in [[South-West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]) partly during a siege in 1922 at which one Vera Meroving is present, but most notably in 1904, during the [[Herero Wars]], when South-West Africa was a [[Germany|German]] [[colony]].

===Chapter Ten: In which various sets of young people get together===
McClintic Sphere, an alto sax player in a jazz band, returns home to his boarding house in Harlem. The previous week, spent playing primarily for condescending, snobby Ivy League students, has left him exhausted, and he relaxes in his room with a prostitute named Ruby. Benny, meanwhile, finally gets a job at Anthroresearch Associates, where he's introduced to SHROUD, a synthetic humanoid with whom he holds imaginary conversations. Pig Bodine and Roony Winsome get into a fight, based on Roony's suspicion that Pig is involved with his (Roony's) wife, Mafia. Meanwhile, Mafia aggressively pursues sex with Benny, who declines. Schoenmaker and Esther get into a few arguments because he says he wants to bring out her inner beauty by performing more plastic surgery on her. The chapter finishes out with the Whole Sick Crew hanging out in various places: Sheridan Square, the Rusty Spoon, Slab in front of his Cheese Danish No. 35 canvas. Stencil, looking for Rachel at her apartment, comes upon Paola who gives him the Confessions of Fausto Maijstral.

===Chapter Eleven: Confessions of Fausto Maijstral===
Fausto Maijstral, Maltese civilian suffering under the German bombardment and working to clear the rubble during [[World War II]] writes a long letter to his daughter Paola, who figures in the Benny Profane story; the letter comes into Stencil's hands. The letter includes copious quotations from Fausto's diary. Besides the place name [[Valletta]], V. figures in the story as an old — or possibly not-so-old — woman crushed by a beam of a fallen building.

=== Chapter Twelve: In which things are not so amusing ===
Roony and Mafia continue fighting, so Roony meets up with McClintic at the V-Note, and they travel to Lenox, Massachusetts. Returning to Matilda's boardinghouse, they meet up with Ruby, who Roony recognizes as being a member of the Crew in disguise. Esther tells Slab she is pregnant. He wants to send her to Cuba to get an abortion, and raises the money by announcing his intentions and asking for money at a party the Crew is throwing in an abandoned warehouse. Roony's attempts to deal with his wife then take a dark turn, but he is saved by Pig. At an airport, Esther and Slab attempt to catch Esther a flight to Cuba, but meet some resistance. Paola, traveling with McClintic, reveals her true identity to him. He delivers the line, "Keep cool, but care," considered the novel's central theme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nazaryan|first1=Alexander|title="V."

=== Chapter Thirteen: In which the yo-yo string is revealed as a state of mind ===
Benny loses his job at Anthroresearch Associates by sleeping in and not being at work to notify the attendant technician that several calamities have occurred in the lab. Rachel nudges him to get a new job, and says that she will find one for him herself. An amusing story unfolds about Benny and Pig during their ''Scaffold'' days. Benny, unable and unwilling to get work, instead takes a self-described vacation and chooses to spend his spare time at the Rusty Spoon. He gets drunk with Stencil, who relates the entirety his knowledge of V. as it stands to this point in the novel. Valletta being the last place on Stencil's journey to find information about V., he asks Benny to accompany him and Paola to the island. Benny and Stencil commit a robbery in perilous circumstances, and then, in late September, they embark for Malta with Paola on board the ''Susanna Squaducci''.

===Chapter Fourteen: V. in love ===
In this chapter V. is entranced by a young ballerina, Mélanie l'Heuremaudit. The story centers on a riotous ballet performance, almost certainly modeled in part on the premiere of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''. The performance centers on a virgin sacrifice by impalement. The young ballerina fails to wear her protective equipment and actually dies by impalement in the course of the performance; everyone assumes her death throes simply to be an uncharacteristically emotional performance.

=== Chapter Fifteen: Sahha ===
Benny and Pig Bodine have one last adventure with two girls, Flip and Flop, as they all get drunk and wander around Washington D.C.. There are two going away parties for Benny, and the chapter ends with Benny, Stencil, and Paola leaving for Malta aboard the ''Susanna Squaducci'' as the Crew looks on and says goodbye.

===Chapter Sixteen: Valletta===
[[Image:KilroySchematic.svg|thumb|right|"Kilroy" schematic. Technically, a ''[[band-pass filter]]''.]] 
As the [[Royal Navy]] mass on Malta in the early stages of the [[Suez Crisis]], Stencil arrives with Benny in tow, searching for Fausto Maijstral. (As always, [[Kilroy was here]] first, and Pynchon proposes a novel origin for the face: that Kilroy was originally a [[schematic]] for part of a [[band-pass filter]].)

===Epilogue===
The last chapter is a flashback to Valletta when Stencil, Sr. was still alive. After World War I he is sent to Malta to observe the various crises going on involving the natives and their desire for independence. He is implored by Maijstral's wife (who is pregnant with Fausto)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brivic|first=Shelly|title=Tears of Rage: The Racial Interface of Modern American Fiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3T20043wdSAC&amp;pg=PT208&amp;lpg=PT208&amp;dq=%22carla+maijstral%22+pregnant&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eRJz-nWbpT&amp;sig=_RqrFVHFzS2Oszs3g_9PGqt1NlI&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22carla%20maijstral%22%20pregnant&amp;f=false|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to relieve him of his duties as a double agent because she fears for his life. Stencil, Sr. meets Veronica Manganese or V and implicitly has sex with her (she is now largely made up of artificial limbs). It is revealed they had trysted in Florence after the riots. He finds out that Maijstral is having an affair with her as well.

Linus Fairing is also working as a double agent for Stencil, and when he leaves for America, having tired of the life of a spy, Stencil's purpose for being in Malta is null.

V releases Stencil from her auspices and Maijstral as well.

Stencil sails off into the Mediterranean and a waterspout blows the ship up into the air, then down into the depths, not too dissimilar from the conclusion of another American masterpiece, [[Moby-Dick]], also a sailor's story.

==Characters==

===Major characters===
* Benny Profane – The protagonist and a self-proclaimed human yo-yo
* Rachel Owlglass – An upper-class woman from the affluent Five Towns on the south shore of Long Island
* Herbert Stencil – A troubled [[Jewish-American]] man who is obsessed with the identity of "V." a woman who is mentioned in his father's journal written shortly before he disappeared in Malta. Stencil speaks almost exclusively in the [[Narration|third person]].

===Minor characters===
* Angel – Puerto Rican sewer alligator hunter and friend of Profane
* Fina – Angel's sister, she acts as a saint to the Playboy gang, often quelling disputes between them and other gangs over territory. In chapter six it is heavily implied that she is raped by the same gang.
* Geronimo
* Slab
* Melvin
* Raoul
* Debb Sensay
* Brad
* Roony Winsome
* Mafia Winsome
* Paola Maijstral – [[Maltese people|Maltese]] immigrant who Profane estimates to be roughly sixteen. Sometime during World War II, Paolo marries Pappy Hod to gain entrance to the United States.
* Esther Harvitz – Rachel's Jewish roommate whom Rachel financially supports.
* McClintic Sphere
* Ferguson Mixolydian – An "Irish Armenian Jew" and the "laziest living being in Nueva York". Ferguson is so lethargic that the only activity that he takes part in excluding television is once a week "to fiddle around at the kitchen sink with dry cells, retorts, alembics, salts solutions."
* Shale Schoenmaker, M.D. – a Jewish plastic surgeon who specializes in [[rhinoplasty]]. Schoenmaker decides to become a plastic surgeon during World War One while working as an engineer in the Aviation Section. During this time he witnesses pilot Evan Godolphin become disfigured after a mission in which his plane was heavily damaged.
* Ploy – A engineer on the mine sweeper ''Impulsive''. Standing five feet tall in boots, Ploy has an extremely violent temperament, oftentimes attempting to start fights with the largest sailors. Ten months before the beginning of the first chapter Ploy's teeth are removed by the Navy, being replaced by a pair of dentures. Ploy entertains himself by biting barmaids at the Sailor's Grave on the buttocks.
* Pig Bodine – A perverted member of the Sick Crew. Prior to joining the crew, Bodine was enlisted on the U.S.S. Scaffold where he operated a pornographic lending library and would write fetish erotica using the ship telegraph. Bodine's knees have the odd ability to lock in place allowing him to effectively sleep while standing, much to the astonishment of the navy physicians.
* Kurt Mondaugen – A engineer who works at Yoyodyne who is interviewed by Stencil.

==Analysis and Reception==
[[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] wrote "In this sort of book, there is no total to arrive at. Nothing makes any waking sense. But it makes a powerful, deeply disturbing dream sense. Nothing in the book seems to have been thrown in arbitrarily, merely to confuse, as is the case when inept authors work at illusion. Pynchon appears to be indulging in the fine, pre-Freudian luxury of dreams dreamt for the dreaming. The book sails with majesty through caverns measureless to man. What does it mean? Who, finally, is V.? Few books haunt the waking or the sleeping mind, but this is one. Who, indeed?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,870237,00.html Time Magazine:  ''A Myth of Alligators'', Review of Thomas Pynchon's ''V.'', Friday, Mar. 15, 1963]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tony Tanner considered the novel an exploration of the plots individuals ascribe onto the ambivalent universe they have no choice but to confront, during a 20th century period in which genuine communication between individuals has been eroded and in which ambiguous societal forces are at work (intentionally or inadvertently) towards a state of entropy; "SHROUD asks, "''Has it occurred to you there may be no more standards for crazy or sane, now that it's started?''" And Benny answers, "''What, for Christ's sake?''" What the 'it' is that has started (if there is an 'it'), what common process links remote imperialist incidents with contemporary automation, tourism, Hitler, and the Whole Sick Crew (if there is any linking common process) - this is what the whole book is about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tanner |first1=Tony |title=City of Words |date=1971 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc. |location=49 East 33rd Street, New York, NY |page=156-162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', George Plimpton called Pynchon "a young writer of staggering promise", lauding his "vigorous and imaginative style", "robust humor" and "tremendous reservoir of information".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/05/18/reviews/pynchon-v.html?_r=2 New York Times: Books, Pynchon's V., May 18, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the novel was awarded a [[William Faulkner Foundation Award]] for best [[debut novel]].

==Editions==
In 2012 it emerged that there were multiple versions of ''V.'' in circulation. This was due to the fact that Pynchon's final modifications were made after the first edition was printed and thus were only implemented in the British, or Jonathan Cape, edition and the Bantam paperback. The fact was forgotten soon after in the U.S., so most US editions, including the newly released eBook, follow the first printing and are therefore unauthorized versions of the text, while the British editions, which follow the first edition printed by Jonathan Cape, contain Pynchon's final revisions.&lt;ref name=TwoVs&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rolls | first1 = Albert | title = The Two ''V.''s of Thomas Pynchon, or from Lippincott to Jonathan Cape and Beyond | doi = 10.7766/orbit.v1.1.33 | journal = Orbit: Writing Around Pynchon | volume = 1 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==References to ''V.'' in other works==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
*The line "Yesterday’s headlines blown by the wind" in English rock band [[Radiohead]]'s 2003 song [[Hail to the Thief|"Scatterbrain"]] was inspired by a passage from the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Growing Pains|first=Tom|last=Doyle|work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|number=261|date=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mimi Fariña|Mimi]] and [[Richard Fariña]]'s 1965 debut album, ''Celebrations for a Grey Day'', includes an instrumental entitled "V." which is linked directly to the novel in the liner notes.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Moore, "Pynchon on Record," ''Pynchon Notes'' no. 10 (October 1982), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A suite of songs on the 1969 album ''[[Volume Two (The Soft Machine album)|Volume Two]]'' by [[Soft Machine]] is titled "Esther's Nose Job," referring to Chapter 4: "In which Esther gets a nose job."&lt;ref&gt;The suite was written by keyboardist Mike Ratledge; Marcus O'Dair notes that ''V''. "was a major influence for Ratledge at the time" (''Different Every Time: The Authorised Biography of Robert Wyatt'' [Serpent's Tail, 2014], p. 107).&lt;/ref&gt;
*The English band [[Benny Profane]] took their name from Pynchon's character.&lt;ref name="Larkin"&gt;Larkin, Colin:"The Guinness Who's Who of Indie and New Wave Music", 1992, Guinness, {{ISBN|0-85112-579-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[The Insect Trust]]'s 1970 album ''Hoboken Saturday Night'' includes the song "Eyes of a New York Woman", with lyrics taken from the novel. The same lyrics form the basis of a different song, "V. in Love," from the album ''Colour Out of Space'' by Favorite Color.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://thomaspynchon.com/thomas-pynchon-inspired-music/2/ Music Inspired by the Novels of Thomas Pynchon]"&lt;/ref&gt;
*In keeping with his [[V (comics)|V]]-theme, the main character in the [[graphic novel]] ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' reads the novel.
*The film ''[[The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension]]'' uses Pynchon's fictional defense contractor [[Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems]], introduced in this novel. This connection led to further references in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''.
*A book with a V on the cover is mentioned as being read by Richard Katz in ''[[Freedom (Franzen novel)|Freedom]]'' by [[Jonathan Franzen]].
*The title of the American [[experimental rock]] band [[Thrice]]'s 2005 album ''[[Vheissu]]'' refers to the book.

'''Velvet''' was a [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[cable television network]] based in [[Quezon City]]. It was owned and operated by [[ABS-CBN Cable Channels|Creative Programs, Inc. (now ABS-CBN Cable Channels)]], a wholly owned subsidiary of the media conglomerate [[ABS-CBN Corporation]]. The primary focus of the network was into women-oriented general entertainment programming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beta.abs-cbn.com/tabid/104/Article/8155/Default.aspx (For Velvet TV Channel Article on abs-cbn.com)]&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Window Seat'''" is a song by [[Erykah Badu]]. It is the [[lead single]] from her album ''[[New Amerykah Part Two (Return of the Ankh)]]'' (2010). It was produced by Badu and [[James Poyser]]. The song is low-tempo [[ballad]] with lyrics that concern escapism and longing for a lover. The [[music video]] for "Window Seat" features Badu walking the streets around [[Dealey Plaza]] in [[Dallas, Texas]], slowly stripping to the nude, before being shot by an unseen assassin. Badu's public nudity, [[guerrilla filmmaking|guerrilla filming]], and the video's allusions to the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] were met with controversy among fans and critics.

==Cancellation==
Zane posted an update on September 13, 2010 on Facebook about the future of the show:

"Many of you have asked about the return of “Zane’s Sex Chronicles” on Cinemax for a third season and I realize that a lot of you ordered the channel just for me. Again, I appreciate you. I wanted to let you know that there will not be a third season. Also, the second season is not scheduled to be released on DVD at this time. But, you can still purchase the first season on Amazon.com or rent it from Blockbuster or NetFlix. For those of you who got really caught up in the characters, there is a tie-in book for the series that digs deeper into their backgrounds and relationships. It is entitled “Zane’s Sex Chronicles,” exactly like the show."
