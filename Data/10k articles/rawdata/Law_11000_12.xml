[[File:Edinburgh Advocate's Library 2.JPG|thumb|Interior of the Advocates Library]]
The '''Advocates Library''', founded in 1682, is the [[law library]] of the [[Faculty of Advocates]], in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="brewer"&gt;{{cite book | last = Brewer | first = E. Cobham | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Dictionary of Phrase and Fable | publisher = Avenel Books | date = 1978 |origyear=reprint of 1894 version | location = Edwinstowe, England | isbn = 0-517-25921-4 | page = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It served as the national [[deposit library]] of Scotland until 1925, at which time through an Act of Parliament&lt;ref&gt;15 George IV, c.73&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Library of Scotland]] was created. All the non-legal collections were given to the National Library. Today, it alone of the Scottish libraries still holds the privilege of receiving a copy of every law book entered at [[Stationers' Hall]]. 

The library forms part of the complex that includes [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]], located on the [[Royal Mile]].

==History==
The Library was formally opened in 1689. It was an initiative of [[George Mackenzie (lawyer)|George Mackenzie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=17579|title=Mackenzie, Sir George, of Rosehaugh |first=Clare|last=Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present library building was designed by [[William Henry Playfair]] in 1830, and is a [[listed building#Scotland|category A listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2200:15:0::::BUILDING,HL:51179,advocates%20library |title=PARLIAMENT SQUARE, ADVOCATES' LIBRARY, INCLUDING WALL AND RAILINGS (Ref:51179) |work=Historic Scotland Listed Buildings |accessdate=2014-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Librarian [[Samuel Halkett]] began an ambitious catalogue, based on the rules of [[John Winter Jones]] for the [[British Museum]] catalogue of 1839, but with extensive  biographical information on authors. It was published in six volumes, from 1858 to 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Cadell &amp; Matheson, pp. 211–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Halkett's successor, [[Thomas Hill Jamieson]], met a fire that damaged some thousands of books on 9 March 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=14644|title=Jamieson, Thomas Hill|first=Iain Gordon|last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1923 the library held around 725,000 books and pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ipdAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OKUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3497%2C7826255 |title=Gift to nation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2839">Between 2009 and 2012, '''Agriculture and Rural Development Day''' ('''ARDD''') was an annual event co-organized by the [[CGIAR|Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research]] (CGIAR), [[Earth System Science Partnership]] (ESSP), [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), [[Global Forum on Agricultural Research]] (GFAR), [[International Federation of Agricultural Producers]] (IFAP), and [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI).

== History ==
The first event took place as a side event at the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP15) in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agricultureday.org/ARDDay2009/|title=Agriculture and Rural Development Day 2009 Website|website=www.agricultureday.org|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second event took place as a side event at the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP15) in [[Cancún]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agricultureday.org/ardday2010/|title=Agriculture and Rural Development Day 2010|website=www.agricultureday.org|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third event took place as a side event at the [[2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP15) in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agricultureday.org/ardday2011/|title=Agriculture and Rural Development Day 2011|website=www.agricultureday.org|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth event took place at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (UNCSD)—also called Rio 2012, Rio+20, or the Earth Summit 2012—in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. It was co-hosted by the [[Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation]] (Embrapa) and the CGIAR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cgiar.org/consortium-events/2012/06/18/agriculture-and-rural-development-day/|title=Agriculture and Rural Development Day|work=CGIAR|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth and final ARDD, called Agriculture, Landscapes, and Livelihoods Day 5&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agricultureday.org/about/index.html Agriculture, Landscapes, and Livelihoods Day 5]&lt;/ref&gt;(ALL-5), took place alongside Forest Day on the sidelines of the [[2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP18) in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wle.cgiar.org/thrive/2012/12/05/story-agriculture-and-climate-change-road-we%E2%80%99ve-travelled|title=The Story of Agriculture and Climate Change: The Road We’ve Travelled|date=2012-12-05|work=Water, Land and Ecosystems|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, this event merged with [[Forest Day]] to become the [[Global Landscapes Forum]] (GLF).

'''Alexander Grothendieck''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|r|oʊ|t|ən|d|iː|k}}; {{IPA-de|ˈɡroːtn̩diːk|lang}}; {{IPA-fr|ɡʁɔtɛndik|lang}}; 28 March 1928&amp;nbsp;– 13 November 2014) was a stateless [[mathematician]] (naturalized French in 1971) who became the leading figure in the creation of modern [[algebraic geometry]].&lt;ref name="jackson2"&gt;{{citation |last=Jackson |first=Allyn |title=Comme Appelé du Néant — As If Summoned from the Void: The Life of Alexandre Grothendieck II |journal=Notices of the American Mathematical Society |volume=51 |issue=10 |year=2004 |url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200410/fea-grothendieck-part2.pdf |format=PDF |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytob"&gt;{{cite news |title=Alexander Grothendieck, Math Enigma, Dies at 86 |date=November 14, 2014 |author1=Bruce Weber |author2=Julie Rehmeyer |publisher=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/world/europe/alexander-grothendieck-math-enigma-dies-at-86.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research extended the scope of the field and added elements of [[commutative algebra]], [[homological algebra]], [[sheaf theory]] and [[category theory]] to its foundations, while his so-called [[Grothendieck's relative point of view|"relative" perspective]] led to revolutionary advances in many areas of [[pure mathematics]].&lt;ref name="jackson2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MumfordTate2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mumford|first1=David|last2=Tate|first2=John|authorlink2=John Tate|title=Alexander Grothendieck (1928–2014) Mathematician who rebuilt algebraic geometry|journal=Nature|volume=517|issue=7534|year=2015|pages=272–272|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/517272a|authorlink1=David Mumford|bibcode=2015Natur.517..272M}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered by many to be the greatest mathematician of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Born in Germany, Grothendieck was raised and lived primarily in France. For much of his working life, however, he was, in effect, [[Statelessness|stateless]].{{sfn|Cartier|2004|loc=p. 10, footnote 12}} As he consistently spelled his first name "Alexander" rather than "Alexandre"{{sfn|Cartier|2004|loc=p. 9}} and his surname, taken from his mother, was the Dutch-like [[Low German]] "Grothendieck", he was sometimes mistakenly believed to be of Dutch origin.{{sfn|Cartier|2001|loc=p. 391, footnote 3}}

Grothendieck began his productive and public career as a mathematician in 1949. In 1958, he was appointed a research professor at the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques|Institut des hautes études scientifiques]] (IHÉS) and remained there until 1970, when, driven by personal and political convictions, he left following a dispute over military funding. He later became professor at the [[University of Montpellier]]&lt;!--(see "Politics and retreat from scientific community" section below, ¶1)--&gt;{{sfn|Scharlau|2008}} and, while still producing relevant mathematical work, he withdrew from the mathematical community and devoted himself to political causes. Soon after his formal retirement in 1988, he moved to the [[Pyrenees]], where he lived in isolation until his death in 2014.{{sfn|Ruelle|2007|p=40}}

== Life ==

===Family and childhood===
Grothendieck was born in [[Berlin]] to [[Anarchism|anarchist]] parents. His father, [[Sascha Schapiro|Alexander "Sascha" Schapiro]] (also known as Alexander Tanaroff), had [[Hassidic]] roots and had been imprisoned in Russia before moving to Germany in 1922, while his mother, Johanna "Hanka" Grothendieck, came from a [[Protestant]] family in [[Hamburg]] and worked as a journalist. Both had broken away from their early backgrounds in their teens.&lt;ref name="siam.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=1405 |title=The Early Background of Genius |access-date=15 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615185446/http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=1405 |archive-date=15 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his birth, Grothendieck's mother was married to the journalist Johannes Raddatz and his birthname was initially recorded as "Alexander Raddatz." The marriage was dissolved in 1929 and Schapiro/Tanaroff acknowledged his paternity, but never married Hanka.&lt;ref name="siam.org"/&gt;

Grothendieck lived with his parents in Berlin until the end of 1933, when his father moved to [[Paris]] to evade [[Nazism]], followed soon thereafter by his mother. They left Grothendieck in the care of Wilhelm Heydorn, a [[Lutheran]] [[pastor]] and teacher&lt;ref name="jackson1"&gt;{{citation |last=Jackson |first=Allyn |title=Comme Appelé du Néant — As If Summoned from the Void: The Life of Alexandre Grothendieck I |journal=Notices of the American Mathematical Society |volume=51 |issue=4 |year=2004 |url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200409/fea-grothendieck-part1.pdf |format=PDF |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Hamburg]]. During this time, his parents took part in the [[Spanish Civil War]], according to [[:de:Winfried Scharlau (Mathematiker)|Winfried Scharlau]], as non-combatant auxiliaries,&lt;ref&gt;Scharlau (2008), p.&amp;nbsp;931:Winfried Scharlau,   'Wer ist Alexander Grothendieck? p.2.:[http://www.scharlau-online.de/DOKS/Wer%20ist%20AG.pdf 'Beide beteiligten sich am Spanischen Bürgerkrieg, nicht aktiv kämpfend, aber unterstützend.']&lt;/ref&gt; though others state that Sascha fought in the anarchist militia.&lt;ref&gt;Reuben Hersh, Vera John-Steiner, [https://books.google.it/books?id=gvsHAnAuIp4C&amp;pg=PA109  ''Loving and Hating Mathematics: Challenging the Myths of Mathematical Life,'']  Princeton University Press, 2011 p.109.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
In May 1939, Grothendieck was put on a train in Hamburg for France.

Many of the refugee children hidden in Chambon attended Cévenol, and it was at this school that Grothendieck apparently first became fascinated with mathematics.&lt;ref name="Liberation-Douroux-Obit-2014-11-13"/&gt;

===Studies and contact with research mathematics===
After the war, the young Grothendieck studied mathematics in France, initially at the [[University of Montpellier]] where he did not initially perform well, failing such classes as astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;http://images.math.cnrs.fr/Alexandre-Grothendieck.html#nh14&lt;/ref&gt; Working on his own, he rediscovered the [[Lebesgue measure]]. After three years of increasingly independent studies there, he went to continue his studies in Paris in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;See Jackson (2004:1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Grothendieck attended [[Henri Cartan]]'s Seminar at [[École Normale Supérieure]], but he lacked the necessary background to follow the high-powered seminar. On the advice of Cartan and [[André Weil]], he moved to the [[University of Nancy]] where he wrote his dissertation under [[Laurent Schwartz]] and [[Jean Dieudonné]] on [[functional analysis]], from 1950 to 1953.&lt;ref name="Festschrift"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Grothendieck Festschrift, Volume I: A Collection of Articles Written in Honor of the 60th Birthday of Alexander Grothendieck |author1=Pierre Cartier |author2=Luc Illusie |author3=Nicholas M. Katz |author4=Gérard Laumon |author5=Yuri I. Manin |date=2007 |chapter=Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time he was a leading expert in the theory of [[topological vector space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Book Reviews : Topological vector spaces, by A. Grothendieck |journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society |url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1976-82-04/S0002-9904-1976-14076-1/S0002-9904-1976-14076-1.pdf |issue= 4|doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1976-14076-1 |date=July 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;. From 1953 to 1955 he moved to the [[University of São Paulo]] in Brazil, where he immigrated by means of a [[Nansen passport]], given that he refused to take French Nationality. By 1957, he set this subject aside in order to work in algebraic geometry and [[homological algebra]].&lt;ref name="Festschrift"/&gt; The same year he was invited to visit Harvard by [[Oscar Zariski]], but the offer fell through when he refused to sign a pledge promising not to work to overthrow the United States government, a position that, he was warned, might have landed him in prison. The prospect did not worry him, as long as he could have access to books.&lt;ref&gt;Reuben Hersh, Vera John-Steiner, [https://books.google.it/books?id=gvsHAnAuIp4C&amp;pg=PA109 ''Loving and Hating Mathematics: Challenging the Myths of Mathematical Life,''] Princeton University Press, 2011 p.113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing Grothendieck during his Nancy years to the [[École Normale Supérieure]] trained students at that time: [[Pierre Samuel]], [[Roger Godement]], [[René Thom]], [[Jacques Dixmier]], [[Jean Cerf]], [[Yvonne Bruhat]], [[Jean-Pierre Serre]], [[Bernard Malgrange]], [[Leila Schneps]] says:

{{quote|He was so completely unknown to this group and to their professors, came from such a deprived and chaotic background, and was, compared to them, so ignorant at the start of his research career, that his fulgurating ascent to sudden stardom is all the more incredible; quite unique in the history of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;''Who Is Alexandre Grothendieck: Anarchy, Mathematics, Spirituality'' A three-volume biography of Alexandre Grothendieck, Volume 2, Chapter 3: [http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~leila.schneps/grothendieckcircle/Mathematics/chap3.pdf From student to celebrity (1949-1952)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===IHÉS years===
In 1958 Grothendieck was installed at the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques|Institut des hautes études scientifiques]] (IHÉS), a new privately funded research institute  that, in effect, had been created for [[Jean Dieudonné]] and Grothendieck.{{sfn|Cartier|2004}} Grothendieck attracted attention by an intense and highly productive activity of seminars there (''de facto'' working groups drafting into foundational work some of the ablest French and other mathematicians of the younger generation).&lt;ref name="jackson1"/&gt; Grothendieck himself practically ceased publication of papers through the conventional, [[learned journal]] route. He was, however, able to play a dominant role in mathematics for around a decade, gathering a strong school.&lt;ref name="artist"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Artist and the Mathematician |author=Amir D. Aczel |date=2009 |publisher=Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, he had officially as students [[Michel Demazure]] (who worked on SGA3, on [[group scheme]]s), [[Luc Illusie]] (cotangent complex), [[Michel Raynaud]], [[Jean-Louis Verdier]] (cofounder of the [[derived category]] theory) and [[Pierre Deligne]]. Collaborators on the SGA projects also included [[Michael Artin]] ([[étale cohomology]]) and [[Nick Katz]] ([[monodromy theory]] and [[Lefschetz pencil]]s). [[Jean Giraud (mathematician)|Jean Giraud]] worked out [[torsor]] theory extensions of [[nonabelian cohomology]]. Many others were involved.

==="Golden Age"===
Alexander Grothendieck's work during the "Golden Age" period at the IHÉS established several unifying themes in [[algebraic geometry]], [[number theory]], [[topology]], [[category theory]] and [[complex analysis]].&lt;ref name="Festschrift"/&gt; His first (pre-IHÉS) discovery in algebraic geometry was the [[Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]], a generalisation of the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]] proved algebraically; in this context he also introduced [[K-theory]]. Then, following the programme he outlined in his talk at the 1958 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], he introduced the theory of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], developing it in detail in his ''[[Éléments de géométrie algébrique]]'' (''EGA'') and providing the new more flexible and general foundations for algebraic geometry that has been adopted in the field since that time.&lt;ref name="jackson1"/&gt; He went on to introduce the [[étale cohomology]] theory of schemes, providing the key tools for proving the [[Weil conjectures]], as well as [[crystalline cohomology]] and [[algebraic de Rham cohomology]] to complement it. Closely linked to these cohomology theories, he originated [[topos]] theory as a generalisation of topology (relevant also in [[categorical logic]]). He also provided an algebraic definition of [[fundamental group]]s of schemes and more generally the main structures of a categorical [[Galois theory]]. As a framework for his [[coherent duality]] theory he also introduced [[derived category|derived categories]], which were further developed by Verdier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Notes on derived categories and Grothendieck duality |author=Joseph Lipman |title=Foundations of Grothendieck Duality for Diagrams of Schemes |series=Lecture Notes in Math., no. 1960 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=New York |date=2009 |url=http://www.math.purdue.edu/~lipman/Duality.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of work on these and other topics were published in the ''EGA'' and in less polished form in the notes of the ''[[Séminaire de géométrie algébrique]]'' (''SGA'') that he directed at the IHÉS.&lt;ref name="jackson1"/&gt;

===Political activism===
Grothendieck's political views were [[Political radicalism|radical]] and [[pacifist]], and he strongly opposed both United States [[Vietnam War|intervention in Vietnam]] and [[Soviet Empire|Soviet military expansionism]]. He gave lectures on [[category theory]] in the forests surrounding [[Hanoi]] while the city was being bombed, to protest against the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Life and Work of Alexander Grothendieck'', ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'', vol. 113, no. 9, footnote 6.&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from scientific life around 1970, having found out that IHÉS was partly funded by the military.&lt;ref&gt;SGA1, Springer Lecture Notes 224, {{pp.|xii, xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to academia a few years later as a professor at the [[University of Montpellier]].

While the issue of military funding was perhaps the most obvious explanation for Grothendieck's departure from the IHÉS, those who knew him say that the causes of the rupture ran deeper. [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]], a ''visiteur de longue durée'' ("long-term guest") at the IHÉS, wrote a piece about Grothendieck for a special volume published on the occasion of the [http://www.ams.org/notices/199903/ihes-changes.pdf IHÉS's fortieth anniversary]. The ''Grothendieck Festschrift'', published in 1990, was a three-volume collection of research papers to mark his sixtieth birthday in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;The editors were [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]], [[Luc Illusie]], [[Nick Katz]], [[Gérard Laumon]], [[Yuri Manin]], and [[Ken Ribet]]. A second edition has been printed (2007) by Birkhauser.&lt;/ref&gt;

In it, Cartier notes that as the son of an antimilitary anarchist and one who grew up among the disenfranchised, Grothendieck always had a deep compassion for the poor and the downtrodden. As Cartier puts it, Grothendieck came to find [[Bures-sur-Yvette]] "''une cage dorée''" ("a gilded cage"). While Grothendieck was at the IHÉS, opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] was heating up, and Cartier suggests that this also reinforced Grothendieck's distaste at having become a mandarin of the scientific world.{{sfn|Cartier|2004}} In addition, after several years at the IHÉS, Grothendieck seemed to cast about for new intellectual interests. By the late 1960s, he had started to become interested in scientific areas outside mathematics. [[David Ruelle]], a physicist who joined the IHÉS faculty in 1964, said that Grothendieck came to talk to him a few times about [[physics]].&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Ruelle&lt;!--not Lorenz?--&gt; invented the concept of a [[strange attractor]] in a [[dynamical system]] and, with the Dutch mathematician [[Floris Takens]], produced a new model for [[turbulence]] during the 1970s.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biology]] interested Grothendieck much more than physics, and he organized some seminars on biological topics.&lt;ref&gt;Allyn Jackson, [http://www.ams.org/notices/199903/ihes-changes.pdf The IHÉS at Forty], Notices of the AMS, March 1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;329–337.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Grothendieck, with two other mathematicians, [[Claude Chevalley]] and [[Pierre Samuel]], created a political group called ''Survivre''—the name later changed to ''Survivre et vivre''. The group published a bulletin and was dedicated to antimilitary and ecological issues, and also developed strong criticism of the indiscriminate use of science and technology.{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} Grothendieck devoted the next three years to this group and served as the main editor of its bulletin.{{sfn|Scharlau|2008}}

After leaving the IHÉS, Grothendieck became a [[temporary professor]] at [[Collège de France]] for two years.{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} He then became a professor at the University of Montpellier, where he became increasingly estranged from the mathematical community. His mathematical career, for the most part, ended when he left the IHÉS.&lt;ref name="nytob"/&gt; He formally retired in 1988, a few years after having accepted a research position at the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique|CNRS]].{{sfn|Scharlau|2008}}

===Manuscripts written in the 1980s===
While not publishing mathematical research in conventional ways during the 1980s, he produced several influential manuscripts with limited distribution, with both mathematical and biographical content.

Produced during 1980 and 1981, ''La Longue Marche à travers la théorie de Galois'' (''[[The Long March Through Galois Theory]]'') is a 1600-page handwritten manuscript containing many of the ideas that led to the ''[[Esquisse d'un programme]]''.&lt;ref name="esquissefr"&gt;Alexandre Grothendieck, [http://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/esquissefr.pdf Esquisse d'un Programme], [http://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/esquisseeng.pdf English translation]&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes a study of [[Teichmüller space|Teichmüller theory]].

In 1983, stimulated by correspondence with [[Ronald Brown (mathematician)|Ronald Brown]] and Tim Porter at  [[Bangor University]], Grothendieck wrote a 600-page manuscript titled ''[[Pursuing Stacks]]'', starting with a letter addressed to [[Daniel Quillen]]. This letter and successive parts were distributed from Bangor (see [[#External links|External links]] below). Within these, in an informal, diary-like manner, Grothendieck explained and developed his ideas on the relationship between [[algebraic homotopy theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]] and prospects for a noncommutative theory of [[Stack (mathematics)|stack]]s. The manuscript, which is being edited for publication by G. Maltsiniotis, later led to another of his monumental works, ''Les Dérivateurs''. Written in 1991, this latter opus of about 2000 pages further developed the homotopical ideas begun in ''Pursuing Stacks''.&lt;ref name="jackson2"/&gt; Much of this work anticipated the subsequent development of the motivic homotopy theory of [[Fabien Morel]] and [[V. Voevodsky]] in the mid-1990s.

In 1984, Grothendieck wrote the proposal ''[[Esquisse d'un Programme]]''&lt;ref name="esquissefr"/&gt; ("Sketch of a Programme") for a position at the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] (CNRS). It describes new ideas for studying the [[moduli space]] of complex curves. Although Grothendieck himself never published his work in this area, the proposal inspired other mathematicians' work by becoming the source of [[dessin d'enfant]] theory and [[Anabelian geometry]]. It was later published in the two-volume [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hlf1j2XmXkcC&amp;dq=Geometric+Galois+Actions&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q9iN4QMkYj&amp;sig=fAsvVlPOhN9K9LfjGFJC5zm_IA4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KW-3ScSkHYHIMuDukOEK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result ''Geometric Galois Actions''] (Cambridge University Press, 1997).

During this period, Grothendieck also gave his consent to publishing some of his drafts for EGA on [[Theorem of Bertini|Bertini-type theorem]]s (''EGA''&amp;nbsp;V, published in Ulam Quarterly in 1992-1993 and later made available on the [http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~leila/grothendieckcircle/index.php Grothendieck Circle] web site in 2004).

In the 1,000-page autobiographical manuscript ''Récoltes et semailles'' (1986) Grothendieck describes his approach to mathematics and his experiences in the mathematical community, a community that initially accepted him in an open and welcoming manner but which he progressively perceived to be governed by competition and status. He complains about what he saw as the "burial" of his work and betrayal by his former students and colleagues after he had left the community.&lt;ref name="jackson1"/&gt; ''Récoltes et semailles'' work is now available on the internet in the French original,&lt;ref name="grothen"&gt;{{fr icon}} Alexander Grothendieck, [http://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~duchamp/Books&amp;more/Grothendieck/RS/pdf/RetS.pdf"''Récoltes et sémailles'', ''Réflexions et témoignage sur un passé de mathématicien.''"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818053357/http://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~duchamp/Books%26more/Grothendieck/RS/pdf/RetS.pdf |date=18 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an English translation is underway. Parts of ''Récoltes et semailles'' have been translated into Spanish&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/ |title=Récoltes et Semailles; La Clef des Songes|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; and into Russian and published in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mccme.ru/free-books/grothendieck/RS.html|title=Free books: Récoltes et semailles|website=www.mccme.ru|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Grothendieck declined the [[Crafoord Prize]] with an open letter to the media. He wrote that established mathematicians like himself had no need for additional financial support and criticized what he saw as the declining ethics of the scientific community, characterized by outright scientific theft that, according to him, had become commonplace and tolerated. The letter also expressed his belief that totally unforeseen events before the end of the century would lead to an unprecedented collapse of civilization. Grothendieck added however that his views are "in no way meant as a criticism of the Royal Academy's aims in the administration of its funds" and added "I regret the inconvenience that my refusal to accept the Crafoord prize may have caused you and the Royal Academy."&lt;ref name=columbia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~lipyan/CrafoordPrize.pdf |title=Crafoord Prize letter, English translation |accessdate=2005-06-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106062005/http://www.math.columbia.edu/~lipyan/CrafoordPrize.pdf |archivedate=6 January 2006 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''La Clef des Songes'', a 315-page manuscript written in 1987, is Grothendieck's account of how his consideration of the source of dreams led him to conclude that [[Existence of God|God exists]].&lt;ref&gt;Scharlau 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;940.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the notes to this manuscript, Grothendieck described the life and work of '''18 "mutants"''', people whom he admired as visionaries far ahead of their time and heralding a new age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scharlau|first=Winfried|date=|title=Who Is Alexander Grothendieck?|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200808/tx080800930p.pdf|journal=Notices of the AMS|volume=55|pages=930–941|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only mathematician on his list was [[Bernhard Riemann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the Catholic mystic [[Marthe Robin]] who was claimed to survive on the Holy Eucharist alone, Grothendieck almost starved himself to death in 1988.{{sfn|Scharlau|2008}} His growing preoccupation with spiritual matters was also evident in a letter titled ''Lettre de la Bonne Nouvelle'' sent to 250 friends in January 1990. In it, he described his encounters with a deity and announced that a "New Age" would commence on 14 October 1996.&lt;ref name="jackson2"/&gt;

===Retirement into reclusion and death===
In 1991, Grothendieck moved to a new address which he did not provide to his previous contacts in the mathematical community.{{sfn|Scharlau|2008}} Very few people visited him afterward. Local villagers helped sustain him with a more varied diet after he tried to live on a staple of [[Taraxacum|dandelion soup]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Derbyshire]], [https://books.google.it/books?id=_hsWNzBvr3oC&amp;pg=PA314 ''Unknown Quantity: A Real and Imaginary History of Algebra,''] National Academies Press, 2006 p.314.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, it was revealed that he lived alone in a house in [[Lasserre, Ariège]], a small village at the foot of the [[Pyrenees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alexandre Grothendieck, le plus grand mathématicien du XXe siècle, est mort |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2014/11/14/le-mathematicien-alexandre-grothendieck-est-mort_4523482_3382.html |publisher=Le Monde |date=November 14, 2014 |author1=Stéphane Foucart |author2=Philippe Pajot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, Grothendieck wrote the letter "Déclaration d'intention de non-publication" to [[Luc Illusie]], claiming that all materials published in his absence have been published without his permission. He asks that none of his work be reproduced in whole or in part and that copies of this work be removed from libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2010/02/09/grothendiecks-letter|title=Grothendieck’s letter|date=2010-02-09|work=Secret Blogging Seminar|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A website devoted to his work was called "an abomination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~leila.schneps/grothendieckcircle/ |title=Grothendieck Circle |accessdate=2015-10-13 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929144122/http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~leila.schneps/grothendieckcircle/ |archivedate=29 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This order may have been reversed later in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.u-psud.fr/~laszlo/sga4.html |title=Réédition des SGA |accessdate=2013-11-12 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629235119/http://www.math.u-psud.fr/~laszlo/sga4.html |archivedate=29 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citizenship===
Grothendieck was born in [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]]. In 1938, aged ten, he moved to France as a refugee. Records of his nationality were destroyed in the fall of Germany in 1945 and he did not apply for French citizenship after the war. He thus became a stateless person for at least the majority of his working life, traveling on a [[Nansen passport]].{{sfn|Cartier|2004|loc=p. 10, footnote 12}}{{sfn|Kleinert|2007}}{{sfn|Douroux|2012}}&lt;!--Note: Douroux 2012's 1971 date is incorrect; given Cartier's other statements, 1981 (i.e. during the 1980s) is more credible (see Cartier 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;393: "...an absurd trial in 1977 due to a 1945 regulation that made it a misdemeanor to meet with a foreigner," indicating that Grothendieck did not have French nationality in 1977.--&gt; Part of this reluctance to hold French nationality is attributed to not wishing to serve in the French military, particularly due to the [[Algerian War]] (1954–62).{{sfn|Cartier|2001}}{{sfn|Cartier|2004}}{{sfn|Kleinert|2007}} He eventually applied for French citizenship in the early 1980s, well past the age that exempted him from military service.{{sfn|Cartier|2004}}

===Family===
Grothendieck was very close to his mother to whom he dedicated his dissertation. She died in 1957 from the [[tuberculosis]] that she contracted in camps for displaced persons.{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} He had five children: a son with his landlady during his time in Nancy,{{sfn|Cartier|2004}} three children, Johanna (1959), Alexander (1961) and Mathieu (1965) with his wife Mireille Dufour,&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, John-Steiner, p.113.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Scharlau|2008}} and one child with Justine Skalba, with whom he lived in a commune in the early 1970s.{{sfn|Scharlau|2008}}

== Mathematical work ==

Grothendieck's early mathematical work was in [[functional analysis]]. Between 1949 and 1953 he worked on his doctoral thesis in this subject at [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], supervised by [[Jean Dieudonné]] and [[Laurent Schwartz]]. His key contributions include [[topological tensor product]]s of [[topological vector space]]s, the theory of [[nuclear space]]s as foundational for [[Schwartz distribution]]s, and the application of [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; spaces]] in studying linear maps between topological vector spaces. In a few years, he had turned himself into a leading authority on this area of functional analysis—to the extent that Dieudonné compares his impact in this field to that of [[Stefan Banach|Banach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dieudonné|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is, however, in [[algebraic geometry]] and related fields where Grothendieck did his most important and influential work. From about 1955 he started to work on [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] theory and [[homological algebra]], producing the influential "[[Tôhoku paper]]" (''Sur quelques points d'algèbre homologique'', published in the [[Tohoku Mathematical Journal]] in 1957) where he introduced [[Abelian category|abelian categories]] and applied their theory to show that [[sheaf cohomology]] can be defined as certain [[derived functor]]s in this context.&lt;ref name="jackson1"/&gt;

Homological methods and sheaf theory had already been introduced in algebraic geometry by [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and others, after sheaves had been defined by [[Jean Leray]]. Grothendieck took them to a higher level of abstraction and turned them into a key organising principle of his theory. He shifted attention from the study of individual varieties to the ''[[Grothendieck's relative point of view|relative point of view]]'' (pairs of varieties related by a [[morphism]]), allowing a broad generalization of many classical theorems.{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} The first major application was the relative version of Serre's theorem showing that the cohomology of a [[coherent sheaf]] on a complete variety is finite-dimensional; Grothendieck's theorem shows that the [[higher direct image]]s of coherent sheaves under a proper map are coherent; this reduces to Serre's theorem over a one-point space.

In 1956, he applied the same thinking to the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]], which had already recently been generalized to any dimension by [[Friedrich Hirzebruch|Hirzebruch]]. The [[Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem]] was announced by Grothendieck at the initial [[Mathematische Arbeitstagung]] in [[Bonn]], in 1957.{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} It appeared in print in a paper written by [[Armand Borel]] with Serre. This result was his first work in algebraic geometry. He went on to plan and execute a programme for rebuilding the foundations of algebraic geometry, which were then in a state of flux and under discussion in [[Claude Chevalley]]'s seminar; he outlined his programme in his talk at the 1958 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]].

His foundational work on algebraic geometry is at a higher level of abstraction than all prior versions. He adapted the use of non-closed [[generic point]]s, which led to the theory of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]]. He also pioneered the systematic use of [[nilpotent]]s. As 'functions' these can take only the value 0, but they carry [[infinitesimal]] information, in purely algebraic settings. His ''theory of schemes'' has become established as the best universal foundation for this field, because of its expressiveness as well as technical depth. In that setting one can use [[birational geometry]], techniques from [[number theory]], [[Galois theory]] and [[commutative algebra]], and close analogues of the methods of [[algebraic topology]], all in an integrated way.&lt;ref name="jackson1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{harv|Deligne|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mclarty"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mclarty |first=Colin |title=The Rising Sea: Grothendieck on simplicity and generality I |url=http://people.math.jussieu.fr/~leila/grothendieckcircle/mclarty1.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=13 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also noted for his mastery of abstract approaches to mathematics and his perfectionism in matters of formulation and presentation.&lt;ref name="artist"/&gt; Relatively little of his work after 1960 was published by the conventional route of the [[learned journal]], circulating initially in duplicated volumes of seminar notes; his influence was to a considerable extent personal. His influence spilled over into many other branches of mathematics, for example the contemporary theory of [[D-module]]s. (It also provoked adverse reactions, with many mathematicians seeking out more concrete areas and problems.)&lt;ref name="scienceline"&gt;{{citation |url=http://scienceline.org/2007/01/math_controversy_peck/ |last=Peck |first=Morgen |title=Equality of Mathematicians |quote=Alexandre Grothendieck is arguably the most important mathematician of the 20th century...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spectator"&gt;{{citation |last=Leith |first=Sam |title=The Einstein of maths |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/12036/the-einstein-of-maths/ |journal=The Spectator |date=20 March 2004 |quote=[A] mathematician of staggering accomplishment ... a legendary figure in the mathematical world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''EGA'', ''SGA'', ''FGA''===
The bulk of Grothendieck's published work is collected in the monumental, yet incomplete, ''[[Éléments de géométrie algébrique]]'' (''EGA'') and ''[[Séminaire de géométrie algébrique]]'' (''SGA''). The collection ''[[Fondements de la Géometrie Algébrique]]'' (''FGA''), which gathers together talks given in the [[Séminaire Bourbaki]], also contains important material.&lt;ref name="jackson1"/&gt;

Grothendieck's work includes the invention of the [[Étale cohomology|étale]] and [[l-adic cohomology]] theories, which explain an observation of [[André Weil]]'s that there is a connection between the topological characteristics of a variety and its diophantine (number theoretic) properties.{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} For example, the number of solutions of an equation over a [[finite field]] reflects the topological nature of its solutions over the [[complex number]]s. Weil realized that to prove such a connection one needed a new cohomology theory, but neither he nor any other expert saw how to do this until such a theory was found by Grothendieck.

This program culminated in the proofs of the [[Weil conjectures]], the last of which was settled by Grothendieck's student [[Pierre Deligne]] in the early 1970s after Grothendieck had largely withdrawn from mathematics.&lt;ref name="jackson1"/&gt;

===Major mathematical contributions===
In Grothendieck's retrospective ''Récoltes et Semailles'', he identified twelve of his contributions which he believed qualified as "great ideas".{{sfn|Grothendieck|1986|p=21}}  In chronological order, they are:
# [[Topological tensor product]]s and [[nuclear space]]s.
# "Continuous" and "discrete" [[Duality (mathematics)|duality]] ([[derived category|derived categories]], "[[six operations (mathematics)|six operations]]").
# Yoga of the [[Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem]] ([[K-theory]], relation with [[intersection theory]]).
# [[Scheme (mathematics)|Scheme]]s.
# [[Topos|Topoi]].
# [[Étale cohomology]] and [[l-adic cohomology]].
# [[Motive (mathematics)|Motive]]s and the [[motivic Galois group]] (Grothendieck ⊗-categories).
# Crystals and [[crystalline cohomology]], yoga of "de Rham coefficients", "Hodge coefficients", ...
# "Topological algebra": ∞-stacks, [[derivator]]s; cohomological formalism of topoi as inspiration for a new [[homotopical algebra]].
# [[Tame topology]].
# Yoga of [[anabelian geometry|anabelian algebraic geometry]], [[Galois–Teichmüller theory]].
# "Schematic" or "arithmetic" point of view for [[regular polyhedron|regular polyhedra]] and regular configurations of all kinds.

Here the term ''yoga'' denotes a kind of "meta-theory" that can be used heuristically; [[Michel Raynaud]] writes the other terms "Ariadne's thread" and "philosophy" as effective equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/notices/200309/rev-raynaud.pdf, at p.&amp;nbsp;2.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Grothendieck wrote that, of these themes, the largest in scope was topoi, as they synthesized algebraic geometry, topology, and arithmetic.  The theme that had been most extensively developed was schemes, which were the framework "''par excellence''" for eight of the other themes (all but 1, 5, and 12).  Grothendieck wrote that the first and last themes, topological tensor products and regular configurations, were of more modest size than the others.  Topological tensor products had played the role of a tool rather than a source of inspiration for further developments; but he expected that regular configurations could not be exhausted within the lifetime of a mathematician who devoted himself to it.  He believed that the deepest themes were motives, anabelian geometry, and Galois–Teichmüller theory.{{sfn|Grothendieck|1986|p=22}}

== Influence ==
Grothendieck is considered by many to be the greatest mathematician of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;  In an obituary [[David Mumford]] and [[John Tate]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Although mathematics became more and more abstract and general throughout the 20th century, it was Alexander Grothendieck who was the greatest master of this trend. His unique skill was to eliminate all unnecessary hypotheses and burrow into an area so deeply that its inner patterns on the most abstract level revealed themselves–and then, like a magician, show how the solution of old problems fell out in straightforward ways now that their real nature had been revealed.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;[http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mumford/blog/2014/Grothendieck.html Alexander Grothendieck obituary by David Mumford and John Tate] David Mumford at Brown and Harvard Universities: Archive for Reprints: ''Can one explain schemes to biologists'', December 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the 1970s, Grothendieck's work was seen as influential not only in algebraic geometry, and the allied fields of sheaf theory and homological algebra,&lt;ref name=M&amp;M&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Saunders Mac Lane]]|author2=[[Ieke Moerdijk]]|title=Sheaves in Geometry and Logic: a First Introduction to Topos Theory|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York Inc.|date=1992|isbn=0-387-97710-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but influenced logic, in the field of categorical logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dov M. Gabbay|author2=Akihiro Kanamori|author3=John Woods, Jr.|title=Sets and Extensions in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZF_QckMFy-oC&amp;pg=PA733|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-51621-3|page=733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometry===
Grothendieck approached algebraic geometry by clarifying the foundations of the field, and by developing mathematical tools intended to prove a number of notable conjectures. Algebraic geometry has traditionally meant the understanding of geometric objects, such as [[algebraic curve]]s and surfaces, through the study of the algebraic equations for those objects. Properties of algebraic equations are in turn studied using the techniques of [[ring theory]]. In this approach, the properties of a geometric object are related to the properties of an associated ring. The space (e.g., real, complex, or projective) in which the object is defined is extrinsic to the object, while the ring is intrinsic.

Grothendieck laid a new foundation for algebraic geometry by making intrinsic spaces ("spectra") and associated rings the primary objects of study. To that end he developed the theory of [[Scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], which can be informally thought of as [[topological space]]s on which a [[commutative ring]] is associated to every open subset of the space. Schemes have become the basic objects of study for practitioners of modern algebraic geometry. Their use as a foundation allowed geometry to absorb technical advances from other fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miles Reid|title=Undergraduate Algebraic Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KvKdSkPwwmMC&amp;pg=PA115|date=15 December 1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-35662-6|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem|generalization]] of the classical [[Riemann-Roch theorem]] related topological properties of complex [[algebraic curve]]s to their algebraic structure. The tools he developed to prove this theorem started the study of [[Algebraic K-theory|algebraic]] and [[topological K-theory]], which study the topological properties of objects by associating them with rings.&lt;ref name="Hartshorne AG"&gt;{{Hartshorne AG}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topological K-theory was founded by [[Michael Atiyah]], after direct contact with Grothendieck's ideas at the [[Bonn Arbeitstagung]].&lt;ref name="Atiyah2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Atiyah|title=Michael Atiyah Collected Works: Volume 7: 2002-2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rm6VAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA383|date=3 April 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-968926-2|pages=383–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cohomology theories===
Grothendieck's construction of new [[cohomology]] theories, which use algebraic techniques to study topological objects, has influenced the development of [[algebraic number theory]], [[algebraic topology]], and [[representation theory]]. As part of this project, his creation of [[topos theory]], a category-theoretic generalization of [[point-set topology]], has influenced the fields of [[set theory]] and [[mathematical logic]].&lt;ref name=M&amp;M /&gt;

The [[Weil conjectures]] were formulated in the later 1940s as a set of mathematical problems in [[arithmetic geometry]]. They describe properties of analytic invariants, called [[local zeta function]]s, of the number of points on an algebraic curve or variety of higher dimension.  Grothendieck's discovery of the [[étale cohomology|ℓ-adic étale cohomology]], the first example of a [[Weil cohomology]] theory, opened the way for a proof of the Weil conjectures, ultimately completed in the 1970s by his student [[Pierre Deligne]].&lt;ref name="Hartshorne AG"/&gt; Grothendieck's large-scale approach has been called a "visionary program."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=M. Ram Murty|author2=V. Kumar Murty|title=The Mathematical Legacy of Srinivasa Ramanujan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4tGFgO_nc8C&amp;pg=PA156|date=6 October 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-81-322-0769-6|pages=156–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ℓ-adic cohomology then became a fundamental tool for number theorists, with applications to the [[Langlands program]].&lt;ref&gt;R. P. Langlands, Modular forms and l-adic representations, Lecture Notes in Math. 349. (1973), 361—500&lt;/ref&gt;

Grothendieck's conjectural theory of [[Motive (algebraic geometry)|motive]]s was intended to be the "ℓ-adic" theory but without the choice of "ℓ", a prime number. It did not provide the intended route to the Weil conjectures, but has been behind modern developments in [[algebraic K-theory]], [[Motivic cohomology|motivic homotopy theory]], and [[motivic integration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J.S. Milne |title=Étale cohomology |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory, [[Daniel Quillen]]'s work, and Grothendieck's theory of [[Chern class]]es, are considered the background to the theory of [[algebraic cobordism]], another algebraic analogue of topological ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marc Levine|author2=Fabien Morel|title=Algebraic Cobordism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=obVAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR8|date=23 February 2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-36824-3|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Category theory===
Grothendieck's emphasis on the role of [[Universal property|universal properties]] across varied mathematical structures brought [[category theory]] into the mainstream as an organizing principle for mathematics in general. Among its uses, category theory creates a common language for describing similar structures and techniques seen in many different mathematical systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/category-theory/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Marquis|first=Jean-Pierre|date=2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His notion of [[abelian category]] is now the basic object of study in [[homological algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=S. Gelfand |author2=Yuri Manin |title=Methods of homological algebra |year=1988 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of a separate mathematical discipline of category theory has been attributed to Grothendieck's influence, though unintentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ralph Krömer|title=Tool and Object: A History and Philosophy of Category Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=41bHxtHxjUAC&amp;pg=PA158|date=25 June 2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-7643-7524-9|pages=158–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
The novel ''Colonel Lágrimas'' (''Colonel Tears'' in English, available by Restless Books) by Puerto Rican - Costa Rican writer Carlos Fonseca is a semibiographic novel about Grothendieck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.restlessbooks.com/bookstore/colonel-lagrimas|title=Colonel Lágrimas|website=Restless Books|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Property law}}
In [[property law]], '''alienation''' is the voluntary act of an owner of some [[property]] disposing of the property, while '''alienable''' is the capacity for a piece of property or a [[Property rights (economics)|property right]] to be sold or otherwise transferred from one party to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/alienable|title=Alienable|first=John C|last=Busby|date=23 September 2009|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/alienable|title=alienable - Definition of alienable in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelawdictionary.org/alienable/|title=What is ALIENABLE? definition of ALIENABLE (Black's Law Dictionary)|date=4 November 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelawdictionary.org/alienation/|title=What is ALIENATION? definition of ALIENATION (Black's Law Dictionary)|date=4 November 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most property is alienable, but some may be subject to [[restraints on alienation]]. In England under the [[Feudal land tenure in England|feudal system]], land was generally transferred by [[subinfeudation]] and alienation required licence from the [[overlord]]. Some objects are incapable of being regarded as property and are '''inalienable''', such as people and body parts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} [[Aboriginal title]] is one example of inalienability (save to [[the Crown]]) in [[common law]] jurisdictions. A similar concept is non-transferability, such as tickets. Rights commonly described as a [[licence]] or permit are generally only personal and are not [[assignment (law)|assignable]]. However, they are alienable in the sense that they can generally be [[Surrender (law)|surrender]]ed.

English common law traditionally protected freehold landowners from unsecured creditors. In 1732, the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] passed legislation entitled “The Act for the More Easy Recovery of Debts in His Majesty’s Plantations and Colonies in America”, which required all real property in [[British America]] to be treated as [[Personal property|chattel]] for debt collection purposes.  The legislation was reenacted by many statehouses after the [[American Revolution]], leading to the more commodified and transferable development of American property law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Priest|first1=Claire|title=Creating an American Property Law: Alienability and Its Limits in American History|journal=[[Harvard Law Review]]|date=2006|volume=120|page=385|url=https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/priest.pdf|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Article 102''' of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] (formerly Article 82 of the [[Treaty establishing the European Community]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/information/treaty.html | title= Changes after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon (1 December 2009) | publisher = [[European Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is aimed at preventing undertakings who hold a dominant position in a market from abusing that position. Its core role is the regulation of monopolies, which restrict competition in private industry and produce worse outcomes for consumers and society. It is the second key provision, after [[Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|Article 101]], in [[European Union competition law|TFEU competition law]]. The text of [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Title VII: Common Rules on Competition, Taxation and Approximation of Laws#Article 102|Article 102]] provides the following,

{{Cquote|Any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within the internal market or in a substantial part of it shall be prohibited as incompatible with the internal market in so far as it may affect trade between Member States."

Such abuse may, in particular, consist in:
:(a) directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading conditions;
:(b) limiting production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers;
:(c) applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage;
:(d) making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts.}}

== Application ==
The wording of the provision gives rise to a number of issues to consider in the application of Article 102; namely, the concept of  ‘one or more undertaking’, ‘Relevant market’, ‘Dominant position’ and ‘Effect on trade between member states’.

=== One or more undertaking ===

==== Undertaking ====
An entity must be an ‘undertaking’ to be subject to [[European Economic Community|Community competition law]] and therefore Article 102. The [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) in [[Höfner and Elser v Macrotron GmbH|Hofner v Elser]] states that “The concept of an undertaking encompasses every entity engaged in economic activity regardless of the legal status of the entity and the way in which it is financed.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61990CJ0041|title=Para 21, Case C-41/90 Hofner and Elser|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The European courts have ruled that Acts of, solidarity (such as the provision of public health care),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?language=en&amp;num=T-319/99|title=Case T-319/99, FENIN v Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  public interest (such as the improvement of air navigation safety),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61992CJ0364|title=Case C-364/92 Eurocontrol|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the protection of the environment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61995CC0343|title=Case C-343/95 Diego Calì &amp; Figli|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  are not economic in nature and therefore fall outside the application of [[European Union competition law|European Community competition]] rules.

==== Collective Dominance ====
Article 102 is not confined to actions of single undertakings as the inclusion of the phrase 'one or more undertaking' leads to the inclusion of 'collective dominance,' which tends to occur were there are a small number of businesses in a market who make concerted strategic decisions taking into account the actions of other members of the [[oligopoly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/art82/discpaper2005.pdf|title=Section 4.3 DG competition discussion paper|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission confirmed the validity of this principle in Airtours v Commission  and in doing so set down a strict set of evidential conditions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61999TO0342|title=Para 62 Case T-342/99 Airtours plc v Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Firstly, each member of the oligopoly must be aware of how the other members are behaving in order to adopt the same common policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A61997TJ0228|title=footnote 38, para 66, Case T-228/97 Irish Sugar|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There must be sufficient transparency in the operations between members of the oligopoly to be aware, sufficiently precisely and quickly, of the way in which the other members' market conduct is evolving.
*Secondly, the situation of coordination must be sufficient and sustained over time.
*Thirdly, the commission must prove that the foreseeable reaction of reaction of current and future competitors, as well as consumers would not jeopardise the result expected from the common policy.

=== Relevant Market ===
{{See main|Relevant market}}Defining the relevant market is a vital precondition to assessing [[Dominance (economics)|dominance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61972CJ0006|title=para 32 Case 6-72 Continental Can|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Market definition can be used to establish the boundaries of competition between undertakings, with the purpose of identifying the competitive constraints faced by the firms.

The commission measures these competitive constrains in both the Market&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/SK/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A31997Y1209%2801%29|title=para 7 Commission Notice on the definition of relevant market share for the purpose of Community competition law (97/C 372/03)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Geographical dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/SK/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A31997Y1209%2801%29|title=para 8 Commission Notice on the definition of relevant market share for the purpose of Community competition law (97/C 372/03)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the relevant market within which to assess competition being a combination of both approaches. With the competitive constraints assessed via [[demand]] substitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/SK/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A31997Y1209%2801%29|title=para 15-19 Commission Notice on the definition of relevant market share for the purpose of Community competition law (97/C 372/03)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Supply (economics)|supply]] substitution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/SK/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A31997Y1209%2801%29|title=para 20-23 Commission Notice on the definition of relevant market share for the purpose of Community competition law (97/C 372/03)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and potential competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/SK/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A31997Y1209%2801%29|title=para 24 Commission Notice on the definition of relevant market share for the purpose of Community competition law (97/C 372/03)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Product Market ====
The Commission defines the relative [[product market]] as, a market that comprises all "products and/or services which are regarded as interchangeable or substitutable by the consumer, by reason of the products' characteristics, their prices and their intended use".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/SK/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A31997Y1209%2801%29|title=Para 7, Commission Notice on the definition of relevant market share for the purpose of Community competition law (97/C 372/03)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two common tests used to assess the interchangeability of product market are:

*The 'hypothetical monopolist' test which is whether a small but significant increase in price is likely be allowed by the hypothetical monopolist company to profit from this. If consumers can and would move away from the hypothetical monopolist's product and onto other products then their market is more widely defined.
*The 'intuitive approach', which focuses on brand loyalty and the use of the products

==== The Geographical Market ====
&lt;p&gt;The Commission defines Geographical market as a "market comprises the area in which the undertakings concerned are involved in the supply and demand of products or services, in which the conditions of competition are sufficiently homogeneous and which can be distinguished from neighbouring areas because the conditions of competition are appreciably different in those area."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/SK/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A31997Y1209%2801%29|title=Para 8 Commission Notice on the definition of relevant market share for the purpose of Community competition law (97/C 372/03)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

==== Cellophane Fallacy ====
The existence of the cellophane fallacy implies that market definition in Article 102 cases needs to be particularly carefully considered and that any single method of market definition, including in particular the SSNIP-test, is likely to be inadequate. It is necessary to rely on a variety of methods for checking the robustness of possible alternative market definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/art82/discpaper2005.pdf|title=Para 47 DG Competition discussion paper on the application of Article 82 of the Treaty to exclusionary abuses|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Dominance===
The EC treaty gives no definition of ‘dominance’ leaving it to the commission subject to the relevant control of the European courts to determine whether a ‘dominant position’ exists by reference to the relevant market factors,  or whether it behaves "to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors, customers and ultimately of its consumer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61976CJ0027|title=C-27/76 United Brands|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Hoffman-la Roche the ECJ ruled that a ‘very large’ market share would give rise a rebuttable presumption of dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61976CJ0085|title=Para.41 Case 85/76 Hoffmann-La Roche|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ECJ then established in [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61986CJ0062 AKZO] following from [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61976CJ0085 Hoffman] that the presumption of dominance arises at a market share of 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61986CJ0062|title=para 60 Case C-62/86 AKZO|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Where a firm has a dominant position, it has "a special responsibility not to allow its conduct to impair competition on the [[Single market|common market]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61981CJ0322|title=Case 322/81 Michelin v Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although an undertakings market shares is a good indication of ‘Dominance’, it is not conclusive and at best serves as a first indication of [[market power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52009XC0224%2801%29|title=Para 11 Guidance on the Commission’s enforcement priorities in applying Article 82 of the EC Treaty to abusive exclusionary conduct by dominant undertakings (2009/C 45/02)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A finding of dominance derives from a combination of several factors, Para 12 of the Commissions guidance highlights three factors that the Commission will consider; Actual Competitors, Potential Competitors, and Countervailing Buying Power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52009XC0224%2801%29|title=Para 12, Communication from the Commission – Guidance on the Commission’s enforcement priorities in applying Article 82 of the EC Treaty to abusive exclusionary conduct by dominant undertakings (2009/C 45/02)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Commissions enforcement priorities ====

The Commission has sought to move towards a more effects based test for dominance and in doing so has published its [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52009XC0224%2801%29 Guidance on Enforcement priorities for article 102], However as the commission cannot bind the European courts the current jurisprudence is unaffected. This has led to some commentators questioning the need for the guidelines and some evening going as far to stress they should be removed as it only serves to further complicate the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geradin|first=Damien|date=2010-03-12|title=Is the Guidance Paper on the Commission’s Enforcement Priorities in Applying Article 102 TFEU to Abusive Exclusionary Conduct Useful?|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1569502|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as noted by Advocate General Mazak in his opinion in TeliaSonera although the commissions’ guidance may not bind the court it provided a ‘useful point of reference’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?language=en&amp;num=C-52/09|title=See fn.21 Opinion of Mr Advocate General Mazák delivered on 2 September 2010, Konkurrensverket v TeliaSonera Sverige|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and It will also form the basis of whether the Commission will pursue claims in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52009XC0224%2801%29|title=Para 2 Communication from the Commission – Guidance on the Commission’s enforcement priorities in applying Article 82 of the EC Treaty to abusive exclusionary conduct by dominant undertakings (2009/C 45/02)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on trade between member states ===
The court of justice ruled in Commercial solvents&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61973CJ0006|title=para.30-35 Commercial Solvents Corporation v Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that the requirement of an appreciable effect on trade between member states would be satisfied where conduct brought about an altercation in the structure of competition in the internal market.

==Abuse==

{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}
Abusive conduct is usually organised under different categories, from those in Article 102, and more. As was stated in ''Continental Can'' [1973] the categories are not closed.

===Price exploitation===
Under Article 102(a) "directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading conditions" is considered abusive. Price exploitation is one example. It is difficult to prove at what point a dominant firm's prices become "exploitative" and this category of abuse is rarely found. In one case however, a French funeral service was found to have demanded exploitative prices, and this was justified on the basis that prices of funeral services outside the region could be compared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61987J0030:EN:NOT C-30/87 ''Corinne Bodson v SA Pompes funèbres des régions libérées'' (1987) ECR 2479]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limiting production===
Under Article 102(b), "limiting production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers" is considered an abuse by a dominant undertaking. An example was found in ''Porto di Genova'' [1991], where a shipping port refused to raise expenditure and update technology. This limited the amount of cargo that the port could deal with to the detriment of some of its users.

===Price discrimination===
{{Main|Price discrimination}}
Price discrimination falls under Article 102(c), whereby an abuse is "applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage". An example of this could be offering rebates to industrial customers who export your company's sugar, but not to Irish customers who are selling their goods in the same market as you are in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61997A0228:EN:NOT ''Irish Sugar'' (1999)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tying===
{{Main|Tying (commerce)}}
Under Article 102(d) "tying" is defined as "making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts." Tying one product into the sale of another can be considered abuse too, being restrictive of consumer choice and depriving competitors of outlets. This was the alleged case in ''Microsoft v. Commission''&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62004A0201:EN:NOT Case T-201/04] ''[[Microsoft v Commission]]'' Order, 22 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; leading to an eventual fine of €497&amp;nbsp;million for including its [[Windows Media Player]] with the [[Microsoft Windows]] platform. A refusal to supply a facility which is essential for all businesses attempting to compete to use can constitute an abuse. One example was in a case involving a medical company named ''Commercial Solvents''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61973J0006:EN:NOT ''[[Commercial Solvents]]'' (1974)]&lt;/ref&gt; When it set up its own rival in the [[tuberculosis]] drugs market, [[Commercial Solvents]] was forced to continue supplying a company named Zoja with the raw materials for the drug. Zoja was the only market competitor, so without the court forcing supply, all competition would have been eliminated.

===Predatory pricing===
{{Main|Predatory pricing}}
Predatory pricing is a controversial category. This is the practice of dropping prices of a product below costs so that one's smaller competitors cannot cover their costs and leave the market. The [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago School]] holds predatory pricing to be impossible, because if it were then banks would lend money to finance it. However, in ''[[France Telecom SA v Commission]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62003A0340:EN:NOT Case T-340/03 ''France Telecom SA v Commission'']&lt;/ref&gt; a broadband internet company was forced to pay €10.35 Million for dropping its prices below its own production costs. It had "no interest in applying such prices except that of eliminating competitors"&lt;ref name="akzo 1991"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61986J0062:EN:NOT ''AKZO'' (1991)]&lt;/ref&gt; and was being subsidised to capture the bigger share of a booming market.

Awa v Independent News Auckland Ltd [1997] 3 NZLR 590  is a cited case in New Zealand regarding the defence of fair comment / honest opinion to a claim involving defamation &lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the aftermath of the death of comedian [[Billy T. James]], his uncle Awa took his body away from his Pakeha wife, in order to give him a customary Māori burial at his ancestral marae.

Auckland's ''[[Sunday News (New Zealand)|Sunday News]]'' newspaper covered it with a quote referring to Awa as "Billy's 'body snatching' uncle".

Awa subsequently sued for defamation, which the newspaper claimed was "fair comment".

==Held==
The Court held it was fair comment.

The '''Butler Act''' was a 1925 [[Tennessee]] law introduced by [[Tennessee House of Representatives]] member [[John Washington Butler]] prohibiting [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] teachers from denying the [[Creationism|Biblical account]] of [[human|mankind]]'s origin. It was enacted as Tennessee Code Annotated Title 49 (Education) Section 1922, having been signed into law by Tennessee governor [[Austin Peay]]. The law also prevented the teaching of the [[human evolution|evolution of man]] from what it referred to as lower orders of [[animal]]s in place of the Biblical account.

The law was challenged later that year in a famous trial in [[Dayton, Tennessee]] called the [[Scopes Trial]] which included a raucous confrontation between prosecution attorney and fundamentalist religious leader, [[William Jennings Bryan]], and noted defense attorney and religious [[agnostic]], [[Clarence Darrow]].

It was repealed in 1967.

==Provisions of the law==

The law, "An act prohibiting the teaching of the Evolution Theory in all the Universities, and all other public schools of Tennessee, which are supported in whole or in part by the public school funds of the State, and to provide penalties for the violations thereof" (Tenn. HB 185, 1925) specifically provided:
:That it shall be unlawful for any teacher in any of the [[University|Universities]], [[Normal school|Normals]] and all other [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] of the State which are supported in whole or in part by the public school funds of the State, to teach any theory that denies the Story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the [[Bible]], and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/tennstat.htm# |title=Full text of the Butler Act and the bill that repealed it |access-date=2005-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520091924/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/tennstat.htm# |archive-date=2009-05-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It additionally outlined that an offending teacher would be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined between $100 and $500 for each offense.

By the terms of the statute, it could be argued, it was not illegal to teach evolution in respect to non-human creatures, such as that [[ape]]s descended from [[protozoa]] or to teach the mechanisms of [[Genetic variation|variation]] and [[natural selection]]. The bill also did not touch on, or restrict the teaching of prevailing scientific theories of [[geology]] or the [[age of the Earth]]. It did not even require that the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] story be taught, but prohibited solely the teaching that man evolved, or any other theory denying that man was [[creationism|created by]] [[God]] as recorded in Genesis. However the author of the law, a Tennessee farmer named [[John Washington Butler]], specifically intended that it would prohibit the teaching of evolution. He later was reported to have said, "No, I didn't know anything about evolution when I introduced it. I'd read in the papers that boys and girls were coming home from school and telling their fathers and mothers that the Bible was all nonsense." After reading copies of [[William Jennings Bryan]]'s lecture "Is the Bible True?" as well as [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' and ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'',{{fact|date=March 2018}} Butler decided the teaching of evolution was dangerous.

==Challenges==

The law was challenged by the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] in the famed [[Scopes Trial]], in which [[John T. Scopes|John Scopes]], a high school science teacher who agreed to be arrested on a charge of having taught evolution, and was nominally served a warrant on May 5, 1925. Scopes was indicted on May 25 and ultimately convicted; on appeal the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] found the law to be constitutional under the [[Tennessee State Constitution]], because:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are not able to see how the prohibition of teaching the theory that man has descended from a lower order of animals gives preference to any religious establishment or mode of worship. So far as we know, there is no religious establishment or organized body that has in its creed or confession of faith any article denying or affirming such a theory. — Scopes v. State 289 S.W. 363, 367 (Tenn. 1927)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite this decision, the Tennessee Supreme Court reversed the conviction on a technicality (that the jury should have fixed the amount of the fine), and the case was not retried. During the trial, Butler told reporters: "I never had any idea my bill would make a fuss. I just thought it would become a law, and that everybody would abide by it and that we wouldn't hear any more of [[evolution]] in Tennessee."

The law remained on the books until 1967, when teacher Gary L. Scott of [[Jacksboro, Tennessee]], who had been dismissed for violation of the act, sued for reinstatement, citing his [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution#Freedom of speech|First Amendment]] right to [[Freedom of speech in the United States|free speech]]. Although his termination was rescinded, Scott continued his fight with a class action lawsuit in the Nashville Federal District Court, seeking a permanent injunction against enforcement of that law. Within three days of his filing suit, a bill for repeal of the Butler Act had passed both houses of the Tennessee legislature and was signed into law May 18 by Governor [[Buford Ellington]].&lt;ref&gt;Randy Moore, ''Evolution in the Courtroom: A Reference Guide,'' ABC-Clio Inc., 2001. pp. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Conseil d'Etat Paris WA.jpg|thumb|380px|right|The [[Palais-Royal]], home of the ''Conseil d'État''.]]

In France, the '''Council of State''' ({{lang-fr|Conseil d'État|links=no}} {{IPA-fr|kɔ̃.sɛj de.ta|}}) is a body of the [[Political system of France|French national government]] that acts both as legal adviser of the executive branch and as the [[supreme court]] for [[Administrative law|administrative justice]].  Established in 1799 by [[Napoléon Bonaparte]] as a successor to the [[Conseil du Roi|King's Council]] (''Conseil du Roi''), it is located in the [[Palais-Royal]] in [[Paris]] and is primarily made up of top-level legal officers. The Vice President of the Council of State ranks 9th as the most important [[French Civil Service|civil servant]] in France.

Members of the Conseil D'État are part of a [[Grands corps de l'État|Grand Corps of the French State]] (grand corps de l'État). The Conseil D'État mainly recruits among the top ranking students graduating from the [[École nationale d'administration]].

{{Politics of France}}

==Composition==
A General Session of the Council of State is presided over by the [[prime minister of France|Prime Minister]] or, in his absence, the [[Minister of Justice (France)|Minister of Justice]].&lt;ref name="legifrance.gouv"&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CJUSADML.rcv&amp;art=L121-7 Code of administrative justice, article L121-7]&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the real presidency of the Council is held by the Vice-President,&lt;ref name="legifrance.gouv" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-etat.fr/cde/fr/le-vice-president-du-ce/.rcv&amp;art=State Council's Website]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; he usually presides all but the most ceremonial assemblies. This is also done for obvious reasons pertaining to the separation of powers.

Other members of the Council include, by decreasing order of importance:
* Department heads (''président de section'')
* [[Councillor of State (France)|Councillors]] ordinary (''conseiller d'État ordinaire'')
* Councillors extraordinary (''conseiller d'État en service extraordinaire'')
* [[Master of Requests (France)|Masters of requests]] (''maître des requêtes'')
* Master of requests extraordinary (''maître des requêtes en service extraordinaire'')
* Senior masters (''auditeur de première classe'')
* Masters (''auditeur de deuxième classe'')

The Vice-President is appointed by Order-in-Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice and is selected from among the Council's department heads or councillors ordinary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CJUSADML.rcv&amp;art=L133-1 Code of administrative justice, article L133-1]&lt;/ref&gt; Division heads are similarly appointed and selected from among the councillors ordinary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CJUSADML.rcv&amp;art=L133-1 Code of administrative justice, article L133-2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Councillors ordinary, masters of requests, and senior masters are appointed based on seniority from the preceding rank.&lt;ref&gt;Code of administrative justice, articles [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CJUSADML.rcv&amp;art=L133-3 L133-3], [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CJUSADML.rcv&amp;art=L133-4 L133-4], [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CJUSADML.rcv&amp;art=L133-5 L133-5].&lt;/ref&gt; Appointees from outside the Council may include administrative law judges&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CJUSADML.rcv&amp;art=L133-8 Code of administrative justice, L133-8]&lt;/ref&gt; or may come from outside the justice system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CJUSADML.rcv&amp;art=L133-7 Code of administrative justice L133-7]&lt;/ref&gt;
Masters are recruited from among the graduates of France's [[École nationale d'administration|National Administration Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CJUSADML.rcv&amp;art=L133-6 Code of administrative justice, article L133-6]&lt;/ref&gt; The Council sits in the [[Palais Royal]] located in [[Paris]].

The Council is divided into 7 divisions:
* Administrative Claims (''section du contentieux'') — see below.
* Report and Studies (''section du rapport et des études''): writes the annual report, conducts studies and helps to oversee judgments and verdicts are carried out.
* Finances (''section des finances''), the Interior (''section de l'intérieur''), Welfare and Social Security (''section sociale''), Public Works (''section des travaux publics'') and Administrative Issues (''section de l'administration'', created by a March 2008 order) review any and all Cabinet-issued orders and statutory instruments and examine and sign off on all Orders of Council (''décrets en Conseil d'État''). These reviews, though mandatory, are not binding. The Council of State also studies legal issues and problems brought before the Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CJUSADML.rcv&amp;art=L112-2 Code of administrative justice, L112-2]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is responsible for carrying out administrative court inspections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CJUSADML.rcv&amp;art=L133-5 Code of administrative justice, L112-5]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Council of State originates from the 13th century by which time the King's Court (''Curia regis'') had split into three sections, one of which was the King's Council (''Curia in consilium'', later ''Conseil du roi''), which too broke up into three distinct parts:  the ''Conseil secret'' 'Privy Council', the ''Conseil privé'' 'Private Council', and ''Conseil des finances'' 'Council of Finances'. Reorganized under Louis XIV into two major groupings, it was the ''Conseil d'État privé, finances et direction'' that was the direct ancestor of the Council of State.  It brought together legal advisors and experts to advise the King on claims against the Crown. Officially established in 1557, this was the largest of the [[Conseil du Roi|King's Council]]s made up of France's [[Chancellor of France|High Chancellor]], lords of peerage, Ministers and Secretaries of State, the [[Controller-General of Finances|Comptroller-General]], 30 [[Conseiller d'État|Councillors of State]], 80 [[maître des requêtes|masters of requests]], and the [[Intendant]]s of Finance. The judicial portion of the Council was known as the ''Conseil d'État privé'' or ''Conseil des parties''.

The kings, who had the power to dispense justice and hand down judgments as the court of last resort, delegated this judicial power to royal courts and [[parlement]]s. But the French king still retained the power to override them at will. Specifically, French kings maintained their privilege to decide major issues and hand down judgements when administrative acts were in dispute. The judgments of the King's Council of State were regarded as being issued under the King's residual proper jurisdiction (''justice retenue''), that is, the sovereign's reserved power to dispense justice in certain matters. Legal advisors also assisted the King in developing new laws and, by delegated jurisdiction, directly exercised sovereign rights (''jura regalia'').

''For more on French government administration during the [[ancien régime|Old Regime]], see [[Ancien Régime in France]].''

The current Council of State was established by the [[French Consulate]] government in 1799 as a judicial body mandated to adjudicate claims against the State and assist in the drafting of important laws. The [[First Consul]] (later [[Emperor]]) presided over Council sessions, and the Council performed many of the functions of a [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]].  After the [[Bourbon Restoration]], the Council was retained as an administrative court but without its former prominence. Its role was more precisely defined by an 1872 Act of Parliament.

==Advisory role==
Certain types of statutory instruments must be examined by the Council and receive its advisory approval, including:
* All draft legislation proposed by non-parliamentary members and prior to being introduced before Parliament.
* Orders-in-council, signed by the Prime Minister and cabinet ministers; any such order is a form of [[delegated legislation]] outlining how a statute or act of Parliament is to be carried out or put into effect. Typically, a statutory law will authorize, prescribe, or prohibit an action defined in broad terms and require a government order to define its scope and application.

The Council's advisory workload is divided between its administrative sections with respect to the ministry or department affected by the government order.

==Administrative justice==
The Council acts as the supreme court of appeal for administrative law courts. It hears both claims against national-level administrative decisions (e.g., orders, rules, regulations, and decisions of the executive branch) and appeals from lower administrative courts. The Council's decisions are final and unappealable.

While strictly speaking the Council is not a court, it functions as a judicial body by adjudicating suits and claims against administrative authorities. Plaintiffs are represented by [[barrister]]s drawn from the Senior Court bar whose members are licensed to argue cases before the Council and French [[Court of Cassation (France)|Supreme Court]]; any such barrister bears the title of Counsel at Senior Court (''avocat aux Conseils'').&lt;ref&gt;Literally, "Barrister at the Councils", an antiquated title where ''council'' refers historically to a number of different conciliar courts, including the old Council of State and the Supreme Court, which grew out of another conciliar court – the Paris Parlement.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original jurisdiction===
The Council hears cases against decisions of the national government, e.g., government orders, ministerial rules and regulations, judgments handed down by committees, commissions, and boards with nationwide jurisdiction, as well as suits concerning regional and EU electoral matters.

The Council of State evaluates how well regulations and administrative decisions comply with higher sources of law, i.e., the [[French Constitution|Constitution]], higher administrative decisions, the general principles of law, [[statute|statut]]ory law, and [[international treaties]] and conventions. Much of France's substantive administrative law is not codified or laid out in statute form, but instead derived from administrative [[case law]], primarily by the Council.

The Council has full discretion to adjudicate on the legality of any [[executive branch]] decision except for the very narrow category of "acts of government" for which it considers itself ''[[forum non conveniens]]''. The Council has judged that such acts are restricted to:
* relationships between the executive branch and the [[legislative branch]], e.g., whether a bill should be submitted to Parliament;
* acts that are part and parcel of [[France]]'s [[foreign policy]].&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurisp/index_ju_la03.shtml analysis on the Conseil's site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031010230501/http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurisp/index_ju_la03.shtml |date=2003-10-10 }} for more information (in French).&lt;/ref&gt;
In this role, the Council provides a powerful check on the actions of the executive.

===Appellate jurisdiction===
The Council of State has [[appellate court|appellate]] jurisdiction over local election judgments from any of the 37 administrative courts.

It acts as a final [[Court of cassation]] for decisions originating from any of the eight appellate administrative courts, meaning that it hears cases in which the plaintiff argues that the appellate court ignored or misinterpreted the law. Should it decide that the original appellate court took the wrong decision, the Council of State will in most situations transfer the case to a different administrative court of appeal, to be re-judged. However, in the interest of swifter decision-making and correct interpretation of the law (''bonne administration de la justice''),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070933&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006449406 Code of administrative justice, article L821-2]&lt;/ref&gt; it also has the right to rule on the case without transfering it, thus acting as an appellate court in last resort (''jugement en dernier ressort'').

===Court procedure===
Like nearly all French courts, the Council's court system is [[inquisitorial]], and proceedings are initiated by a statement of claim detailing the factual background of the case and why the appellent should be granted relief. The Council then begins a formal investigation, asking the appellee, i.e., the government or a government agency or office, to satisfy the Council with a detailed statement of defense. [[Legal burden of proof|Burden of proof]] does not lie with the plaintiff; instead, the Council decides whether or not the appellent has cause to bring suit and whether the government was in error if information provided by the appellent is sufficient to locate previously undisclosed evidence. Of course, both parties may submit additional pleadings and information until the case is ready for final judgment.

The formation of judgement depends on the importance of the case, for the jurisprudence and the interest of the law. All of the formations belong to the Administrative Claims department.

The small cases (without new legal issues) are treated by one under-department (''sous-section''). There are 10 under-departments. The bigger cases are for the united under-departments (''sous-sections réunies''), concerning two under-departments (for some important fiscal cases, three or four under-departments can be concerned, into a special formation, the "full fiscal" (''plénière fiscale''). 
The more important cases are for the ''administrative claims department'' judgement formation (''Section''). Only the very important cases, with hard, new and important legal issues are concerned. There are about between 20 and 40 cases per year into this high formation. This formation concerns the president of the ten under-departments, the three assistant-presidents of the administrative claims department and the president of the department (plus the magistrate responsible of the investigation about the case, then 15 members).

The major cases are resolved by the ''administrative claims assembly'' (''Assemblée du contentieux''). All the presidents of departments are there, under the presidency of the Vice-President of the Council of State. Less than 10 cases per year are concerned.

All the cases, even the ones eventually resolved by the ''Assemblée du contentieux'', are first studied by an under-department.

Although the procedure is written, one of the highlights of the judgement is the oral conclusions of the ''rapporteur public'' (public magistrate), giving his personal vision of the case, totally impartial and free, on a pure legal point of view. The reading of the old conclusions is often useful to understand the mind of the judges and the reason of the solution given to the case (precision : the judges are not bound by the conclusion : they are free to not follow them).

Since an order of 2009 (n° 2009–14, 7 January 2009), there is a possibility to speak after the ''rapporteur public''. The lawyers use this possibility only for the major cases, when it is really useful (e.g. for the ''Hoffmann-Gleman'' case – 16 February 2009 – concerning the indemnisation of the daughter of a deported Jew during the World War II because of the French state's responsibility).

In some cases, there may be some confusion as to whether a case should be heard before an [[administrative courts|administrative law court]] or [[judicial court]], in which case the Court of Jurisdictional Disputes, or ''tribunal des conflits'', sat by an even number of State councillors and [[Court of Cassation (France)|Supreme Court]] justices and chaired by the Minister of Justice, is convened to decide to whom the matter shall be vested.

===Major rulings of the Council of State===

Exercising judicial review over almost all acts of the executive branch, the Council of State's judgments may be of considerable importance, often not for the actual case judged, but for its importance in shaping legal interpretation. While France is a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] country and there is no formal rule of precedent ([[stare decisis]]), lower courts follow the ''[[jurisprudence constante]]'' doctrine with regard to the Council of State. The Council's major rulings are collected into law reports and commented on by scholars; the [http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ Council's official website] carries a [https://web.archive.org/web/20031009043111/http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurisp/index_ju_la00.shtml list of comments on important decisions]. The Council has shaped its own legal [[doctrine]] which consists mostly of principles deduced from cases but incorporates considerable [[jurisprudence]] derived from [[statute]]s.

Rulings are named for the moving parties (appellents) in the cases and under highly formal courtesy titles. Men's names used to be preceded by ''Sieur'', women's names by ''Dame'' or ''Demoiselle'', and widows were referred to by their husband's name ''Dame veuve''.

About 10,000 rulings per year are given by the Council of State.

The most important rulings are collected in a publication called "G.A.J.A" (i.e. ''Les Grands Arrêts de la Jurisprudence Administrative'' – The major rulings of the administrative jurisprudence -), published by [[Dalloz]] editions and written by some of the most influential authors or judges of the time in France (e.g. Bruno Genevois or Prosper Weil). The GAJA explains about 120 rulings, from 1873 to now, and quotes several hundreds of other important rulings.

Important rulings include:

* February 19, 1875 – [https://web.archive.org/web/20031010230501/http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurisp/index_ju_la03.shtml Prince Napoléon]&lt;br&gt;The fact that a decision has been taken with political considerations does not make it an "act of government" that cannot be adjudicated by the Council ([[wikt:rescind|rescinding]] a previous [[doctrine]]). A prince had been removed from the Army for political reasons. The Council stated that his case had to be heard, but then decided that it was unfounded because the law said that his commission could be revoked.
* May 28, 1954 – [https://web.archive.org/web/20031004115425/http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurisp/index_ju_la35.shtml Barel]. ''Freedom of opinion of [[French Civil Service|civil servants]].''&lt;br&gt; After a number of [[Communist]]s had been refused admission to the [[École nationale d'administration]] it was decided that the Government cannot exclude people from applying for civil service positions solely on the basis of their political convictions.
*  October 19, 1962 – [https://web.archive.org/web/20030820140532/http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurisp/index_ju_la39.shtml Canal, Robin &amp; Godot]&lt;br&gt;The [[executive (government)|executive branch]] may make decisions by [[ordonnance|ordinance]] only within a narrowly defined scope authorised by the enabling law. The executive cannot mandate the creation of [[court]]s whose procedures and lack of recourse fall outside the general principles of [[criminal law]].&lt;br&gt;This decision was the source of tensions between the Council and then [[President of France|President]] [[Charles De Gaulle]].
* February 3, 1989 – [https://web.archive.org/web/20030820133103/http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurisp/index_ju_la43.shtml Alitalia corporation]&lt;br&gt;The [[executive (government)|executive branch]] is responsible for voiding its own unlawful rules and regulations, even if they were initially lawful. Regulatory law must comply with [[European Union]] directives in force.
* October 27, 1995 – [https://web.archive.org/web/20080205040152/http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurisp/index_ju_la47.shtml Commune of Morsang-sur-Orge], also known commonly as the "[[dwarf tossing]] case".&lt;br&gt;Respect for human dignity is to be included as part of the ''ordre public'' (the principles governing the public realm in France). In this case a mayor had prohibited a dwarf-tossing event on the grounds was against the "public interest" because it did not respect human dignity. This decision stops short of including [[morality]] as part of the ''ordre public''.
* March 3, 2004 – [https://web.archive.org/web/20040313022806/http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/actual/index_ac_lc0405.shtml The asbestos case].&lt;br&gt;The State may be held responsible for not taking appropriate measures, in accordance with current scientific knowledge, to safeguard workers' health (against asbestos), even if workers are employed by private employers.

==French Institute of Administratives Sciences==

The Council of State is linked to the [[French Institute of Administrative Sciences (IFSA)]]. The vice-president of the Council of State is the president of the IFSA and its main members are state councelors.
In 2009, the Council of State hosted IFSA's annual conference which was organized on the theme: "public security : partnership between public power and private sector."

'''Constructive possession''' is a [[legal fiction]] to describe a situation where an individual has actual control over [[Personal property|chattels]] or [[real property]] without actually having physical control of the same assets. At law, a person with constructive possession stands in the same legal position as a person with actual possession.

For example, if one's car is sitting in one's driveway, one has physical possession of the car. However, any person with the key has constructive possession, as they may take physical possession at any time without further [[consent]] from one.

Constructive possession is an important concept in both the [[criminal law]] regarding [[theft]] and [[embezzlement]], and the [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] regarding [[Possession (law)|possession]] of land and chattels. For example, if someone [[credit card fraud|steals your credit card number]], the actual credit card never leaves your actual possession, but the person who has stolen the number does have constructive possession, and could most likely be charged with theft of your credit card information. 

Constructive possession is also an important concept in cases of [[seizure]] of goods by private or government authorities. Take, for example, a large piece of equipment. Should money be lent against the value of the equipment, and the loan goes into default, the [[creditor]] may find it difficult to actually remove the equipment in a timely manner. However, it may by notice to the borrower take constructive possession, which effectively prevents the borrower from further using the equipment pending its removal. Similarly, when a landlord exercises a contractual remedy of [[distraint]] of goods for unpaid [[renting|rent]], the landlord need not remove the goods from the premises, but may take constructive possession of the goods through a simple declaration. At that point, if the tenant attempted to remove them, the tenant would be guilty of theft. 

However, a person who makes it impossible to take possession of another's property has taken actual possession, not constructive possession. For example, if someone chains someone else's car to an immovable object, he or she has taken possession of it even though he or she has not moved it.

Constructive possession can also refer to items inside of a vehicle. It is possible for the owner and driver of the vehicle to be in constructive possession of all items inside their car. If a minor were to be driving their car with passengers who have possession of alcohol or any illegal substance, the driver may be cited for constructive possession

A person can be charged with constructive possession of an illegal device if they possess the otherwise legal material to assemble it. If a person has in his possession or control the ingredients to make an explosive device, he can be charged with constructive possession of that device.

{{Contract law}}

A '''contractual term''' is "Any provision forming part of a contract".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Martin, E |editor2=Law, J |title=Oxford Dictionary of Law |edition=6th |year=2006 |location=London |publisher=[[Oxford University Press|OUP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each term gives rise to a [[contract]]ual [[Law of obligations|obligation]], [[Breach of contract|breach]] of which can give rise to [[lawsuit|litigation]]. Not all terms are stated expressly and some terms carry less legal gravity as they are peripheral to the objectives of the contract.

==Classification of term==

===Condition or Warranty===
Conditions are terms that go to the very root of a contract. Breach of a condition will entitle the innocent party to terminate the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=Luna Park (NSW) Ltd v Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd |year=1938 |court=HCA |num=66 |parallelcite=(1938) 61 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 286 |courtname=auto}}; see also {{cite AustLII |litigants=Associated Newspapers Ltd v Bancks |year=1951 |court=HCA |num=24 |parallelcite=(1951) 83 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 322 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A warranty&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with a product warranty, which is always referred to as a 'guarantee' in [[law]].&lt;/ref&gt; is less imperative than a condition, so the contract will survive a breach. Breach of either a condition or a warranty will give rise to [[damages]].

It is an objective matter of fact whether a term goes to the root of a contract. By way of illustration, an actress's obligation to perform the opening night of a [[theatre|theatrical]] production is a condition,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Poussard v Spiers and Pond]]'' (1876) 1 QBD 410.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas a singer's obligation to perform during the first three days of rehearsal is a warranty.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bettini v Gye]]'' (1876) 1 QBD 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Statute]] may also declare a term or nature of term to be a condition or warranty. For example, the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979|''Sale of Goods Act'' 1979]] (UK) s15A&lt;ref&gt;As added by the ''Sale of Goods Act'' 1994 (UK) s4(1).&lt;/ref&gt; provides that terms as to title, description, quality, and sample (as described in the [[Act of Parliament|Act]]) are conditions save in certain defined circumstances.

===Innominate term===
[[Lord Diplock]], in ''[[Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite BAILII |litigants=[[Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd]] |year=1961 |court=EWCA |num=7 |parallelcite=[1962] 1 All ER 474 |pinpoint= |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; created the concept of an innominate term, breach of which may or may not go to the root of the contract depending upon the nature of the breach. Breach of these terms, as with all terms, will give rise to damages. Whether or not it repudiates the contract depends upon whether [[legal benefit]] of the contract has been removed from the innocent party. Megaw LJ, in 1970, preferred the use of the classic categorizing into condition or warranty due to [[legal certainty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite BAILII |litigants=[[Maredelanto Compania Naviera SA v Bergbau-Handel GmbH]], [[The Mihalis Angelos]] |year=1970 |court=EWCA |num=4 |parallelcite=[1970] 3 All ER 125 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was interpreted by the House of Lords as merely restricting its application in ''[[Reardon Smith Line Ltd. v Hansen-Tangen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Reardon Smith Line Ltd. v Hansen-Tangen'' [1976] 3 All ER 570&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enforceability ==
In general, parties can only sue for enforcement of valid contractual terms as opposed to representations or mere puffs.

===Statements===
Only certain statements create contractual obligations. Statements can be split into the following types:
* '''Puff (sales talk):''' If no [[reasonable person]] hearing this statement would take it seriously, it is a puff, and no action in contract is available if the statement proves to be wrong. It may also be referred to as "puffery". This is common in [[television commercial]]s.
* '''Representation:''' A representation is a statement of fact which does not amount to a term of the contract but it is one that the maker of the statement does not guarantee the truth of. This gives rise to no contractual obligation but may amount to a [[tort]], for example [[misrepresentation]].
* '''Term:''' A term is similar to a representation, but the truth of the statement is guaranteed by the person who made the statement therefore giving rise to a contractual obligation. For the purposes of Breach of Contract, a term may further be categorized as a condition, warranty or innominate term.

===Determination of nature of a statement===
There are various factors that a [[court]] may take into account in determining the nature of a statement. These include:
* '''Timing''': If the contract was concluded soon after the statement was made, this is a strong indication that the statement induced the person to enter into the contract. Lapse of a week within the negotiations of a [[car]] sale was held to amount only to a representation in ''Routledge v McKay''&lt;ref name=Routledge&gt;{{Cite BAILII |litigants=Routledge v McKay |year=1954 |court=EWCA |num=8 |parallelcite=[1954] 1 All ER 855 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Content of statement''': It is necessary to consider what was said in the given context, which has nothing to do with the importance of a statement.
* '''Knowledge and expertise''': In ''[[Oscar Chess Ltd v Williams]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite BAILII |litigants=[[Oscar Chess Ltd v Williams]] |year=1956 |court=EWCA |num=5 |parallelcite=[1957] 1 WLR 370 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a person selling a [[car]] to a [[second-hand]] [[car]] dealer stated, as per a document received when he bought it, that it was a 1948 [[Morris Motors|Morris]], when it transpired it was a 1939 model car. It was held that the statement did not become a term because a reasonable person in the position of the car dealer would not have thought that an inexperienced person would have guaranteed the truth of the statement. In ''[[Dick Bentley Productions Ltd v Harold Smith (Motors) Ltd]]'' a dealer sold a car stating it had done 20,000 miles since an engine refit; the true figure was about 100,000. It was held this was a term. The dealer "was in a position to know, or at least to find out, the history of the car. He could get it by writing to the makers. He did not do so. Indeed it was done later. When the history of this car was examined, his statement turned out to be quite wrong. He ought to have known better. There was no reasonable foundation for it."
* '''Reduction into Writing''': Where the contract is consolidated into writing, previous spoken terms, omitted from the consolidation, will probably be relegated to representations.&lt;ref name=Routledge /&gt; The case of ''Birch v Paramount Estates Ltd.'' (1956) &lt;ref&gt;''Birch v Paramount Estates Ltd'' (1956) 16 EG 396&lt;/ref&gt; provided that a very important spoken term may persist even if omitted from the written consolidation; this case concerned the quality of workmanship in the construction of a house.

The [[parol evidence rule]] limits what things can be taken into account when trying to interpret a contract. This rule has practically ceased operation under [[UK]] law,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} but remains functional in Australian Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd |year=2004 |court=HCA |num=55 |parallelcite=(2005) 218 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 471 |pinpoint=[33] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implied terms==
{{See also|Implied terms in English law}}
A term may either be expressed or implied. An express term is stated by the parties during negotiation or written in a contractual document. Implied terms are not stated but nevertheless form a provision of the contract.

===Terms implied in fact===
The [[Privy Council]] established a five-stage test in ''[[BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings]] |year=1977 |court=UKPC |num=13 |format=1 |parallelcite=(1977) 180 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 266 |courtname=auto |juris=Victoria}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the English Court of Appeal sounded a note of caution with regard to the ''BP'' case in ''Philips Electronique Grand Public SA v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd'' in which the Master of the Rolls described the test as "almost misleading" in its simplicity.&lt;ref&gt;''Philips Electronique Grand Public SA v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd'' [1995] EMLR 472 at 481.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Reasonableness and equitableness:''' The implied term must be reasonable and equitable. In ''Biotechnology Australia Pty Ltd v Pace'',&lt;ref&gt;''Biotechnology Australia Pty Ltd v Pace'' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=(1988)%2015%20NSWLR%20130 (1988) 15 NSWLR 130] [[New South Wales Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] (NSW, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt; it was held a term that imposes a significant detriment or burden on the other party is unlikely to be equitable.
# '''Business efficacy:''' The implied term must be necessary for the business efficacy of the contract. For instance, if the term simply causes the contract to operate better, that does not fit this criterion. This is the principle laid out in ''[[The Moorcock]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Moorcock]]'' (1889) 14 PD 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The presiding [[judge]] created a quaint concept of an ''officious bystander''; if the ''officious bystander'' were to propose a term and both the parties would be likely to reply with a testy "oh, of course", the term is implied.
# '''Obviousness:''' The term is so obvious that it goes without saying. Furthermore, there must be one and only one thing that would be implied by the parties. For example, in ''[[Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1982|litigants=[[Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW]] |parallelcite=(1982) 149 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 337 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a term regarding the inability of construction company to work three shifts a day could not be implied because it was unclear what form it would have taken. In [[English law]], this principle was established in the case of ''Spring v NASDS'',&lt;ref&gt;''Spring v NASDS'' [1956] 1 WLR 585.&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of a [[trade union]] membership contract.
# '''Clear expression:''' The term must be capable of clear expression. No specific technical knowledge should be required.
# '''Consistency:''' The implied term may not contradict an express term.

The [[High Court of Australia]] has ruled that the test in ''BP'' applies only to [[formal contract]]s.  In the case of an [[informal contract]], where the parties have not attempted to stipulate the full terms, the courts should imply a term upon referring to the imputed intention of the parties, provided that the particular term is necessary for the effective operation of the contract.&lt;ref name=Hawkins&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=Hawkins v Clayton |year=1988 |court=HCA |num=15 |parallelcite=(1988) 164 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 539 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Byrne&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd |year=1995 |court=HCA |num=24 |parallelcite=(1995) 185 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 410 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In implying terms in an informal contract, the High Court has suggested that a flexible approach is required.&lt;ref name=Hawkins /&gt;&lt;ref name=Byrne /&gt; In a case where it is apparent that the parties have not attempted to spell out the full terms of their contract, the court should imply a term by reference to the imputed intentions of the parties if, but only if, it can be seen that the implication of the particular term is necessary for the reasonable or effective operation of a contract of that nature in the circumstances of the case.&lt;ref name=Hawkins /&gt; Obviousness also remains an important element in implying a term in an informal contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd |year=1995 |court=HCA |num=24 |courtname=auto |parallelcite=(1995) 185 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 410 at p. 446 per McHugh &amp; Gummow JJ}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terms implied in law===
These are terms that have been implied into standardized relationships.

====Common law====

*''Liverpool City Council v Irwin''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite BAILII |litigants=[[Liverpool City Council v Irwin]] |year=1976 |court=UKHL |num=1 |parallelcite=[1976] 2 WLR 562 |pinpoint= |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; established a term to be implied into all contracts between tenant and landlord that the landlord is obliged to keep the common areas in a reasonable state of repair.
*''Wong Mee Wan v Kwan Kin Travel Services Ltd''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite BAILII |litigants=Wong Mee Wan v Kwan Kin Travel Services Ltd |year=1995 |court=UKPC |num=42 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1995] 4 All ER 745 |pinpoint= |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; established that when a tour operator contracts to provide services, a term is implied that those services will be performed with reasonable duty and care.

====Statutory====

The rules by which many contracts are governed are provided in specialized statutes that deal with particular subjects. Most [[Country|countries]], for example, have statutes which deal directly with sale of goods, lease transactions, and trade practices. For example, each [[U.S. state|American state]] except [[Louisiana]] has adopted Article 2 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], which regulates contracts for the sale of goods.&lt;ref&gt;For links and comparison among states on the adoption of the UCC, see [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uniform/ucc.html Cornell Law Uniform Laws].&lt;/ref&gt; The most important [[legislation]] implying terms under [[United Kingdom]] law are the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]], the [[Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000]] and the [[Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982]] which imply terms into all contracts whereby goods are sold or services provided.

===Terms implied by custom or trade===
One is generally bound by the custom of the industry that one is in. To imply a term due to custom or trade, one must prove the existence of the custom, which must be notorious, certain, legal and reasonable.&lt;ref name="Con-stan Industries v Norwich"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|14|1986|litigants=[[Con-stan Industries of Australia Pty Ltd v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Ltd]] |parallelcite=(1986) 160 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 226 |courtname=auto |date=11 April 1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Frigaliment Importing Co., Ltd., v. B.N.S. International Sales Corp.'', 190 F. Supp. 116 (S.D.N.Y. 1960) (plaintiff failed to prove what he meant by "chicken") and U.C.C. § 1-205.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Course of dealing===
If two parties have regularly conducted business on certain terms, the terms may be assumed to be same for each contract made, if not expressly agreed to the contrary. The parties must have dealt on numerous occasions and been aware of the term purported to be implied. In ''Hollier v Rambler Motors Ltd''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite BAILII |litigants=[[Hollier v Rambler Motors Ltd]] |year=1971 |court=EWCA |num=12 |parallelcite=[1972] QB 71 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Balmain New Ferry"&gt;see also {{cite AustLII|HCA|83|1906|litigants=[[Balmain New Ferry Co Ltd v Robertson]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1906/83.pdf (1906) 4 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 379] |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] |date=18 December 1906}}.&lt;/ref&gt; four occasions over five years was held to be sufficient. In ''[[British Crane Hire Corp Ltd v Ipswich Plant Hire Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite BAILII |litigants=[[British Crane Hire Corp Ltd v Ipswich Plant Hire Ltd]] |year=1973 |court=EWCA |num=6 |parallelcite= [1975] QB 303 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; written terms were held to have been implied into an oral contract in which there was no mention of written terms.

===Good faith===
{{Main|Good faith}}
It is common for lengthy negotiations to be written into a heads of agreement document (sometimes unsigned, and sometimes labelled 'subject to contract') that includes a clause to the effect that the rest of the agreement is to be negotiated. Although these cases may appear to fall into the category of agreement to agree, [[Australian]] [[court]]s will imply an obligation to negotiate in [[good faith]] provided that certain conditions are satisfied:&lt;ref&gt;''Coal Cliff Collieries Pty Ltd v Sijehama Pty Ltd'' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=24+NSWLR+1 (1991) 24 NSWLR 1] [[New South Wales Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] (NSW, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Negotiations were well-advanced and the large proportion of terms have been worked out; and
* There exists some mechanism to resolve disputes if the negotiations broke down.

The test of whether one has acted in good faith is a subjective one; the cases suggest honesty, and possibly also reasonableness. There is no such implied term under [[UK]] [[common law]]: an attempt was made by [[Lord Denning]] in a series of case during the 1970s and 1980s but they are no longer considered 'good law'.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} European legislation imposes this duty, but only in certain circumstances.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]]&lt;ref&gt;Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 (UK) [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/2083/contents/made SI 1999/2083]&lt;/ref&gt; reg 8 renders ineffective any 'unfair' contractual term if made between a seller or supplier and a consumer.&lt;ref&gt;For definitions, see reg 3(1).&lt;/ref&gt;
Regulation 5 of the statutory instrument further elaborates upon the concept of 'unfair', which is rather novel to English law. 'Unfair' is a term in [[standard form contract|standard form]] (specifically that was not individually negotiated) that "causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract to the detriment of the consumer".&lt;ref&gt;[[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]] reg 5(1)&lt;/ref&gt; It must also be shown the term lacks 'good faith'; the claim failed in ''[[Director General of Fair Trading v First National Bank plc]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite BAILII |litigants=[[Director General of Fair Trading v First National Bank plc]] |year=2001 |court=UKHL |num=52 |parallelcite=[2001] 3 WLR 1297 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as striking down a relatively high [[interest]] rate (falling short of [[extortion]]ary rates) would mean borrower could have safely ignored the interest rates in its loan agreements (see UK requirements for consumer financial advice/advice waivers in major consumer loan agreements) and that high-rate lenders would receive no interest.

=="Subject to" contracts==

=== Four Categories ===
If a contract specifies "subject to contract", it may fall into one of three categories as identified in ''Masters v Cameron'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=Masters v Cameron |year=1954 |court=HCA |num=72 |parallelcite=(1954) 91 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 353 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The parties are immediately bound to the bargain, but they intend to restate the deal in a more formalized contract that will not have a different effect; or
# The parties have completely agreed to the terms, but have made the execution of some terms in the contract conditional on the creation of a formal contract; or
# It is merely an agreement to agree lacking the requisite ''intention'' to create legal relations, and the deal will only be binding unless and until the formalized contract has been drawn up. 
Subsequent authorities have been willing to recognize a fourth category in addition to those stated in ''Masters v Cameron''.&lt;ref&gt;''Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd v GR Securities Pty Ltd'' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=(1986)%2040%20NSWLR%20622(1986) 40 NSWLR 622] [[New South Wales Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] (NSW, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt;
#&lt;li value="4"&gt;The parties intend to immediately bound by the terms agreed upon and expect to create a further contract as a replacement for the initial contract which will contain additional terms (if agreed upon).&lt;/li&gt;

=== Contingent Condition ===
If a contract specifies "subject to finance", it may impose certain obligations on the purchaser:&lt;ref name=Meehan&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=Meehan v Jones |year=1982 |court=HCA |num=52 |parallelcite=(1982) 149 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 571 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the contract is silent on the level of effort required by the finance seeker (usually purchaser) to obtain finance, the finance seeker may come under an implied duty to cooperate. Furthermore, whether the finance seeker may validly claim non-fulfillment of a contingent condition, despite being genuinely satisfied with finance he or she obtained before the expiration of the contingent condition, was not decided in ''Meehan v Jones''.&lt;ref name=Meehan /&gt;

"Subject to finance" provisions may be also referred to as contingent conditions, which come under two categories: condition precedent and condition subsequent.
Conditions precedent are conditions that have to be complied with before performance of a contract is required by both parties
With conditions subsequent, parties do not need to perform the contract if a condition is not yet (such as official certification to practice in a particular course of business). The non-fulfillment of a contingent condition means that the parties are not required to perform their side of the respective bargain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1988">'''Court auction''' is an auction which takes place at a public location designated by the court.

If a property owner fails to pay the mortgage, the mortgage holder can [[Foreclosure|foreclose]] on that property. If the owner is unable to make sufficient payments, the property can be sold at auction. The time and place of the auction is published in official records.

In case the value of the debt being foreclosed on is substantially less than the market value of the real property, this can finish the trouble for the debitor by paying all the credits.

== Germany ==

In [[Germany]] the court may suspend the auction for 6 months on the debtor's justified request. Justification may be hardship, e.g. if debtor has a physical disability and cannot find adequate housing. The creditor can object up to twice if the result of the auction is not sufficient to fulfil the claim. The bidder must deposit security in the amount of 10%. The highest bidder becomes the owner of the real property. If the claim is greater than the market value of the real property, debts are handled in an [[insolvency]] proceeding.

== Spain ==

Spanish mortgage holders are responsible for the full amount of the loan to the bank in addition to penalty interest charges, and court fees.

== United States ==

Historically, the vast majority of judicial foreclosures have been unopposed, since most defaulting borrowers have no money with which to hire counsel. The highest bidder at the auction becomes the owner of the real property, free and clear of interest of the former owner. In 2009 there was a growing consensus that the deepening collapse of the housing market was at the heart of the country’s acute economic downturn. The rules for court auction differ in the states.

In [[United States administrative law]], '''deferred action''' is an immigration status which the [[executive branch of the United States government|executive branch]] can grant to [[illegal immigrants]]. This does not give them legal status, but can indefinitely delay their deportation. Deferred action is an exercise of the executive branch's [[enforcement discretion]] and was first publicly defined in a 1975 administrative guidance document published by the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://elibrary.law.psu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=fac_works|title = The role of prosecutorial discretion in immigration law|last = Wadhia|first = Shoba S.|date = 2010|journal = Connecticut Public Interest Law Journal|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |volume = 9|pages = 243–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major grants of deferred action include:

* [[Family Fairness|Family Fairness Program]], a program launched by President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1987, and expanded by President [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1990, which granted deferred action to spouses and children of immigrants granted amnesty under the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.vox.com/2014/11/20/7254361/family-fairness-immigration|title = Did George H.W.

'''Deputy Commissioner''' (popularly abbreviated to "DC") or [[District Magistrate (Bangladesh)|District Magistrate]] is a chief administrative and revenue officer of a [[Districts of Bangladesh|district]] or an administrative sub-unit of a [[Divisions of Bangladesh|division]]. According to the [[Code of Criminal Procedure (Bangladesh)|Code of Criminal Procedure of Bangladesh]], the Government shall appoint as many persons as it thinks fit to be Executive Magistrates and shall appoint one of them to be the District Magistrate.&lt;ref name="EM"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/print_sections.php?id=75%20Accessed&amp;vol=&amp;sections_id=14300|title=The Code of Criminal Procedure - Executive Magistrate|website=bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term District Magistrate is used in the Criminal procedure code to denote the principal executive magistrate of the district. However, after 1960, the district magistrate term came to be redesignated throughout the country as Deputy Commissioner or DC. During the early year, before Bangladesh era, the deputy commissioner's office used to be concerned with internal security and revenue administration. Over the time, however, the office has become increasingly occupied with the general welfare of the people in the district. The Deputy Commissioner is a representative of the Government in the field of law and order, land administration, disaster management and general and local elections. The deputy commissioner works under the general guidance and supervision of the Divisional Commissioner. They are under the administrative control of the Cabinet Division although their posting and transfer are made by the [[Ministry of Public Administration]]. The deputy commissioners are drawn from the members of the [[Bangladesh Civil Service]] (Administration).&lt;ref name="DC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Deputy_Commissioner|title=District Commissioner - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1970 to 1978, Hathaway, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]],&lt;ref name=voterportal/&gt; was his city's last public works commissioner,&lt;ref&gt;In [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] and in other cities with the [[City commission|commission]] form of government, the commissioner exercised legislative functions on the city council and an executive role as a municipal department head. This position should not be confused with a [[county commission]]er, most of whom were and still are elected by single-member districts. County commissioners are the "legislators" of a county (called parish in Louisiana), with the [[county judge]] normally in the role of the "executive" head of the county. In Louisiana, the executive of the parish may be known as the police jury president, the president of the parish, or a parish "administrator", depending on the structure of the parish government. City commissioners could not be chosen on a district basis, as their administrative duties affected the entire city. [[African American]]s were not then elected to city government in most parts of the South. Soon an outcry in the [[Civil rights movement]] raised legal challenges to the city commission governments.&lt;/ref&gt; an office abolished effective November 1978 with the implementation of a new [[Municipal charter|city charter]]. From 1980 to 2000, he was the [[sheriff]] of [[Caddo Parish, Louisiana|Caddo Parish]] in the northwestern corner of his state.&lt;ref name=pastsheriffs&gt;Past sheriffs, Caddo Parish history (no longer on-line)|accessdate=June 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Hathaway is the younger and only surviving son of Jessie Oberdorfer and Oscar Clayton Hathaway, Sr.&lt;ref name=oscarobit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/shreveporttimes/obituary.aspx?n=oscar-c-hathaway-jr&amp;pid=183117684#sthash.NtEcfJKb.dpuf|title=Oscar Clayton Hathaway, Jr.|publisher=''[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Shreveport Times]]''|accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political life==

After working during the 1950s and early 1960s in insurance and investment banking, Hathaway joined the staff of the Caddo Parish Police Jury in 1962. He was named secretary-treasurer of the jury on May 10, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Veta Samuels, ''History of Caddo Parish Police Jury - Caddo Parish Commission since 1840''&lt;/ref&gt; The police jury, the traditional governing body of the parish, was  renamed in 1984 as the Caddo Parish Commission.&lt;ref name=politicalcard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bossier.pastperfect-online.com/36091cgi/mweb.exe?request=record&amp;id=4400185E-5047-4AF4-9A37-764013325364&amp;type=301|title=Hathaway's campaign card|date=1970|publisher=bossier.pastperfect-online.com|accessdate=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shreveport public works commissioner, 1970-1978===

Hathaway stepped down as police jury secretary-treasurer in 1970 to contest the office of Shreveport public works commissioner under the then [[City commission government|commission]] form of city government. He replaced an interim commissioner on the city council who had taken office on January 1, 1969, following the resignation of the 34-year incumbent, [[H. Lane Mitchell]], who was caught up in a 1971 scandal involving four counts of theft in the office which he had already vacated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/19711060246So2d814_1915.xml/STATE%20v.%20MITCHELL|title=''State v. Mitchell''|date=May 3, 1971|publisher=leagle.com|accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hathaway was one of five citywide elected commissioners who acted in both executive and legislative roles in the governance of Shreveport municipal affairs for an eight-year period. He presided over the public works department as an executive and cast a single vote on the Shreveport City Council, when it  in met in public session. His administration of the office coincided with that of [[mayor of Shreveport, Louisiana|Mayor]] [[Calhoun Allen]], who was technically the "commissioner of administration". Hathaway's council colleagues included fellow Democrat Public Utilities Commissioner William "Bill" Collins, and after Collins resigned in 1977, [[Billy Guin]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] who served for the remaining year-and-a-half in that position, as well as Finance Commissioner [[George A. Burton]], the first Republican to hold Shreveport municipal office since [[Reconstruction era in the United States|Reconstruction]], and Public Safety Commissioner [[George W. D'Artois]], who was forced from office in the summer of 1976 in another corruption scandal.&lt;ref name=copsgobad&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2011/10/brad-kozak/when-cops-go-bad-i-the-tale-of-george-dartois/|title=When Cops Go Bad I: The Tale of George D’Artois|author=Brad Kozak|date=October 19, 2011|publisher=thetruthaboutguns.com|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====D'Artois corruption case====

Under pressure from the business community, the city council unanimously announced in the spring of 1976 that it would investigate Commissioner D'Artois regarding a series of corruption cases in the public safety department. When public opinion swung against the council members for "investigating themselves", Mayor Allen called for the probe to be turned over to the office of [[Attorney General of Louisiana|Attorney General]] [[William J. Guste]]. Allen and D'Artois were previously allies on the council,&lt;ref&gt;"L. Calhoun Allen's Victory handshake with George W. D'Artois", ''The Shreveport Times'', August 17, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; but Hathaway had often opposed them both. When Allen called for D'Artois to step down from office voluntarily while the state probe proceeded, Hathaway said that he thought that it made little difference whether D'Artois remained in office while the investigation was underway because he believed that Guste's staff would conduct a thorough, fair investigation. Guste's investigators soon indicated the probe would go beyond the public safety department, with at Mayor Allen and Utilities Commissioner Collins as well.&lt;ref name=bkeith/&gt; D'Artois did not step down voluntarily but was forced to resign on August 6, 1976, when he was arrested for conspiracy to murder his former advertising specialist, [[Jim Leslie (Louisiana)|Jim Leslie]] of Shreveport. He died of complications of heart surgery ten months later in June 1977{{cn|date=August 2017}} in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Texas]]. Many unanswered questions remained,&lt;ref name=bkeith&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NvpN1t9TMrgC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=George+Wendell+D'Artois&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FLoGsv9uIL&amp;sig=M4vFHkw4ijLolZvKDlHRFDjmACg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w0-XU5b6FuqH8AHr-YCoCQ&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=George%20Wendell%20D'Artois&amp;f=false|title=The Commissioner: A True Story of Deceit, Dishonor, and Death|author=[[Bill Keith (Louisiana politician)|Bill Keith]]|publisher=[[Pelican Publishing Company]]|location=[[Gretna, Louisiana|Gretna]], [[Louisiana]]|year=2009|pages=101, 106|isbn=9781-58980-655-9|accessdate=June 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as what role if any D'Artois had in the assassination of Jim Leslie.&lt;ref name=copsgobad/&gt;

====Challenge to commission form of government====

The [[interest group]], Blacks United for Lasting Leadership, Inc., an [[African-American]] [[civil rights]] organization in Shreveport, filed a [[class action]] lawsuit against the City of Shreveport to force an end to the commission form of government. In 1974, blacks constituted 32 percent of the Shreveport population, but no African American had served on the city council, which since 1910 had consisted of five commissioners, including the mayor. By the time of the [[2010 U.S. Census]] forty years later, Shreveport was nearly 55 percent black in population.&lt;ref&gt;2010 General profile of housing and population characteristics for Shreveport from the U.S. Census&lt;/ref&gt; BULL alleged that the inherent at-large feature of the commission government operated unconstitutionally to dilute the votes of blacks. The [[United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana]] agreed and declared the commission government unconstitutional under the [[14th Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The decision was affirmed in March 1978 by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openjurist.org/571/f2d/248/blacks-united-for-lasting-leadership-inc-v-city-of-shreveport|title=Blacks United for Lasting Leadership, Inc., et al., Plaintiffs-Appellees, vs. the City of Shreveport, Defendants-Appellants|date=March 29, 1978|publisher=openjurist.org|accessdate=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shreveport hence switched to the [[mayor-council]] form of government with the fast-approaching 1978 elections, when Commissioner Don Hathaway ran a strong but losing race for mayor to then automobile dealer, [[William T. "Bill" Hanna]], who made issue that he was an "outsider" to the troubles that had befallen City Hall, now called Government Plaza, during the preceding term of office.{{cn|date=August 2017}} Utilities Commissioner Billy Guin was another unsuccessful candidate for mayor in the September 16 [[nonpartisan blanket primary]], also known as the [[jungle primary]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Shreveport Times'', September 17, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shreveport Journal]]'', September 18, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Days after his defeat for mayor, on November 21, 1978, Hathaway joined Mayor-elect Hanna, outgoing Mayor Allen, and outgoing Commissioner Guin for the dedication of a new Exhibition Hall on the riverfront, a structure later named in Allen's honor,{{cn|date=August 2017}} now known as StageWorks of Louisiana.

===Caddo Parish sheriff, 1980-2000===

====Duties as sheriff====

Hathaway soon rebounded politically upon his election on December 9, 1979 as the Caddo Parish sheriff and ''[[ex officio]]'' tax collector. The one-term incumbent, [[Harold Terry|Harold Monroe Terry]] (1925-2016), did not seek reelection, and Hathaway defeated his fellow Democrat Jim Adger, an agri-businessman, in a runoff contest, 55.6 to 44.4 percent. The election corresponded with the narrow victory of Republican [[Dave Treen|David C. Treen]] as governor.&lt;ref&gt;''The Shreveport Times'', December 10, 1974, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Hathaway was reelected thereafter with little opposition thereafter through his retirement in July 2000. In his last election in October 1995, Hathway polled nearly two thirds of the ballots cast against two opponents, a fellow Democrat, Jerry Henderson, and Donnie Ray O'Briant, a Republican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/10211995/10211995_09.html|title=Results for Election Date: 10/21/1995: Caddo Parish|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sheriff in Caddo Parish frequently serves multiple terms; Hathaway's predecessor, Harold Monroe Terry (born September 1925), is the exception. Terry served only one term from 1976 to 1980, the shortest tenure of any Caddo Parish sheriff in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=pastsheriffs/&gt;

Under Hathaway, the sheriff's department increased over two decades from 150 to 600 deputies; the budget, from $8 million to $32 million annually. He introduced programs to assist deputies enrolled in higher education programs. He altered recruiting and hiring to incorporate background checks and [[polygraph]]s.{{cn|date=August 2017}} Homer C. Bryant, Jr. (1924-1999), a Shreveport native and [[Purple Heart]] recipient during [[World War II]], was Hathaway's major in charge of criminal investigations; a  polygraph examiner, he was particularly known for his expertise and dedication to law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Homer C. Bryant, Jr.|publisher=''The Shreveport Times''|date=July 11, 1999|accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hathaway standardized compensation and introduced incentive pay. Hathaway brought all divisions of the office into three functional components: (1) Administration, (2) Detention, and (3) Operations. He computerized the tax division, record keeping, and collections departments. He doubled the number of deputies on patrol. He created or expanded already existing special teams for hazardous materials, special response, search and rescue, and helicopter monitoring. He established substations at strategic locations.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

In 1982, Caddo sheriff's deputies responded to a call of an abandoned 36-hour-old infant boy weighing seven pounds, wrapped only in a towel, and in excellent condition. He was found in a carport at a house on Red Oak Lane along with an attached note asking that good parents be found. The child was taken to LSU Medical Center pediatric services for transition to proper authorities. Hathaway said, "We probably have to assume the baby was not hospital-delivered, if only because hospitals [then] usually keep newborns longer than thirty-six hours. On the other hand, if the baby were home-delivered and without the help of a doctor, there would be no record of birth." Chief deputy David Milton Almond (1937-2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/96144305|title=D. Milton Almond|publisher=findagrave.com|accessdate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&amp;article_id=184&amp;issue_id=12004|title=International Association of Chiefs of Police Deaths|publisher=''Police Chief Magazine''|location=[[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]]|date=January 2004|accessdate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that the abandonment was only the second such case that he had witnessed in his then seventeen years in law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louisdl.louislibraries.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15140coll23/id/1749|title=Newborn Boy Found in Carport|publisher=''The Shreveport Times''|author=Ray Waddle and Mike Silva (photo)|date=February 24, 1982|accessdate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Hathaway announced that his deputies engaging in [[undercover]] drug purchases had obtained thirty [[Arrest warrant|warrants]] and made at least seventeen [[arrest]]s. All suspects were booked with distributing such substances as [[amphetamine]]s, [[marijuana]], [[cocaine]], and [[valium]]. One suspect was charged with the distribution of a false representation of a controlled dangerous substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/11469462/|title=Undercover drug buys net arrests|date=October 9, 1987|publisher=''[[Galveston Daily News]]''|location=[[Galveston, Texas]]|page=8|accessdate=June 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Hathaway had introduced the canine corps for use in [[narcotics]] detection.&lt;ref name=pastsheriffs/&gt; In 1998, Caddo deputies with the help of drug-sniffing dogs uncovered two bags at the [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] [[bus station]] in Shreveport containing $310,000 and $20,000 in narcotics. A [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] man caught by random search with $4,000 in his possession confessed to owning the two unclaimed bags. Hathaway said the $314,000 was "by far the largest amount of money we've picked up in this type of investigation." Sixty percent of the funds went to sheriff' department coffers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Suspected Florida Drug Dealer Caught on a Greyhound|date=August 28, 1998|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Public relations=====

In 1983, Sheriff Hathaway was part of a contingent of six hundred supporters of [[Edwin Edwards]] who joined Edwards in a celebratory tour of [[France]] and [[Belgium]]. The tab of $10,000 per person was used to retire Edwards's 1983 campaign debt of $4.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;"Marion Edwards, brother of ex-Louisiana governor, dies at 84", ''[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|Alexandria Town Talk]]'', January 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards had just scored his third term as [[governor of Louisiana|governor]] by unseating the Republican [[David C. Treen]]. On a train in [[Paris]], Hathaway was presented a drawing on a menu of an oak tree by the Louisiana artist [[George Rodrigue]] before Rodrigue became famous with his blue dog symbol. In 2004, Rodrigue came to Shreveport with incoming Governor [[Kathleen Blanco]] and made an appearance at the Louisiana State Exhibit Museum, where he autographed Hathaway's menu from more than twenty years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgerodrigue.com/january11-2-2004.htm |title=Blue Dog Artist Visits Shreveport With Portrait of Governor Blanco |publisher=[[KTAL-TV]] |author=Justin Herndon |date=January 11, 2004 |accessdate=June 21, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808130837/http://georgerodrigue.com/january11-2-2004.htm |archivedate=August 8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, in a celebration of [[Freddie Spencer]]'s victory the previous year in the [[List of Grand Prix motorcycle racing World Champions by year|500cc Grand Prix World Championship]] in [[motorcycle]] racing, Hathaway made Spencer an "honorary deputy" as the Shreveort native returned home for "Freddie Spencer Day", declared by Mayor [[John Brennan Hussey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MvO5RoR1buMC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Don+Hathaway,+former+sheriff+of+Caddo+Parish,+LA&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Pfp00uIVlU&amp;sig=c1rZdrejZCqJ2Eh63VVmGqTCvIk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p9KkU9qCJcukqAaJhIJ4&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Don%20Hathaway%2C%20former%20sheriff%20of%20Caddo%20Parish%2C%20LA&amp;f=false|title=Freddie Goes Home a Hero|publisher=''[[Cycle World]]''|date=January–May 1984|accessdate=June 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Housing inmates====

As sheriff, Hathaway found himself frequently at odds with his two former employers as police jury treasurer and as public works commissioner, the Caddo Parish Commission and the City of Shreveport, in regard to the financial cost of housing inmates at the Caddo Correctional Institute, a penal farm at [[Spring Ridge, Louisiana|Spring Ridge]] near [[Keithville, Louisiana|Keithville]] in southern Caddo Parish known for a high rate of unrest and inmate escape. On May 17, 1992, deputy Darren Wayne Hill claimed serious brain injuries sustained during a riot at CCI. Hill hence filed suit against Hathaway on the grounds that the sheriff was negligent in maintaining order at the facility. However, Hill never won a judgment through the [[Louisiana Circuit Courts of Appeal|Louisiana Circuit Court of Appeal for the Second District]] in Shreveport because of procedural errors in his claim. Hill had sought financial relief through the Sheriff's Pension and Relief Fund as well as damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/1999908741So2d167_1784.xml/HILL%20v.%20HATHAWAY|title=Darren Wayne HILL, Plaintiff-appellant, v. Donald HATHAWAY, Sheriff of Caddo Parish, Louisiana, Defendant-appellee|date=June 16, 1999|publisher=leagle.com|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, Sheriff Hathaway was responsible only for the jail within the courthouse in Shreveport. On April 6, 1982, however, the sheriff's department assumed full control of the penal farm from the former police jury, the predecessor of the Caddo Parish Commission. Hathaway renamed the facility the Caddo Detention Center. In time, Hathaway was overrun with the increasing number of inmates and the associated rising costs to shelter them. Hathaway said that CDC could not adequately accommodate some 375 inmates, more than two thirds of whom were blacks, with some "murderers and rapists". Hathaway also said the community needed adequate psychiatric services because numerous inmates were mental cases in need of medical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisianadigitallibrary.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15140coll23/id/2797|title=Med Center cuts affect sheriff|author=Robert Moore|date=November 18, 1982|publisher=''The Shreveport Times''|accessdate=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1982, a 17-year-old [[bank robbery]] suspect, Jerry Anderson, leaped eight stories to his death while in custody at LSU Medical Center in Shreveport. Questions arose as to whether the youth was depressed or having a seizure. The sheriff's department investigation determined that young Anderson was [[Suicide|suicidal]]. The suspect was in leg chains and under guard by a private security firm, rather than a sheriff's deputy. Hathaway said the department had too few deputies to guard individual prisoners and had to hire outside assistance in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15140coll23/id/1777|title=Suspect Dies; Police Jury Asks Probe|author=Don Waitt|date=January 28, 1982|publisher=''The Shreveport Times''|accessdate=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 23, 1988, two inmates attacked the 26-year-old deputy, known only as "Mick", who was on guard at CDC in the section called "West Max" after he led a group of prisoners outside for their exercise routine. The men were taken to an area called the "bullpen", which was reinforced with razor wire to lessen the success of escape attempts. Under a dead-lock head-lock, the deputy barely escaped with his life, but security personnel came to his defense in time. The attack was touched off when the deputy told an inmate that he could not wear a blue bandana on his head, a symbol of [[gang]]s. The incident was one of numerous reported cases of violence in the CDC. Mick reported that his family safety was in jeopardy for a time because one of the inmates seized his paycheck which happened to be in his pocket. The check revealed the deputy's family address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solafidesolachristos.blogspot.com/2013_12_01_archive.html|title=Sola Fide: The Showdown in West Max|publisher=solafidesolachristos.blogspot.com|date=December 17, 2013|accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a court case, the State of Louisiana ruled that the Caddo Parish Commission was primarily responsible for the maintenance cost of the CDC prisoners, rather than the City of Shreveport or the sheriff's department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/19951444658So2d786_11382.xml/CITY%20OF%20SHREVEPORT%20v.%20CADDO%20PARISH|title=''City of Shreveport v. Caddo Parish et al''|date=August 17, 1995|publisher=leagle.com|accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the detention center ceased housing parish prisoners after the opening on Forum Drive in north Shreveport of a new 1,070-bed facility called Caddo Correctional Center, a structure that Hathaway had urged since he became sheriff. Still operational, this jail is designed to manage a large number of inmates with relatively few personnel. CCC is the largest facility of its kind in the tri-state area of Louisiana, Texas, and [[Arkansas]].{{cn|date=August 2017}} In 1999, Hathaway was sued by a CCC inmate, Charles Barr, who alleged that he slipped and fell on the wet floor of his cell, which caused a personal injury that required major medical treatment. Barr's "inmate [[grievance]]" was dismissed on the grounds that his injury was a result of [[diabetes]]. Hathaway prevailed in the ruling from the Second District Appeals Court by showing that the in-house grievance procedure is not subject to judicial review and that Barr did not seek redress through [[tort]] action as required in such circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/1999846747So2d99_1649.xml/BARR%20v.%20HATHAWAY|title=Charles BARR, Plaintiff-Appellant, v. Don HATHAWAY, Sheriff, Caddo Parish, Louisiana, Defendant-Appellee|date=August 18, 1999|publisher=leagle.com|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Leadership roles====

In 1990, Hathaway brought to Shreveport the [[Drug Abuse Resistance Education]] program, first established by [[Daryl Gates]], the chief of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] from 1978 to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caddosheriff.org/content.php?c=105|title=D.A.R.E.|publisher=caddosheriff.org|accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hathaway started a "Senior Citizen Academy" in which older residents, many foster grandparents, completed a 14-hour curriculum that gave them an overview of the operations of the sheriff's office as well as practical safety tips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-38780141.html|title=Sheriff's third senior citizen academy graduates 25|date=November 1998|publisher=highbeam.com|accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1994 to 1996, Hathaway was president of the Northwest Law Enforcement Planning Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rrdnw.com/History1.htm|title=History of Northwest Law Enforcement Agency|publisher=rrdnw.com|accessdate=June 15, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221233247/http://rrdnw.com/History1.htm|archivedate=February 21, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, shortly after he left the sheriff's office, the Northwest agency honored Hathaway for his twenty years of leadership in the department. The award was presented by neighboring [[Bossier Parish, Louisiana|Bossier Parish]] Sheriff [[Larry Deen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-62881034.html|title=Sheriff Hathaway receives high honor|date=September 1, 2000|publisher=highbeam.com|accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1996 to 1997, Hathaway was the president of the [[National Sheriffs' Association]],&lt;ref name=walkeralley/&gt; one of only six sheriffs in Louisiana since the creation of the organization in 1938 to have held that position, as of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsa.org/Docs/Newsletters/TheLouisianaSheriffJan2014.pdf|title=Louisiana Sheriffs’ Association Celebrates 75 Years with Dedication of New Headquarters|author=Laurne Labee Leher|date=January 2014|publisher=lsa.org|accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheriffs.org/content/past-presidents|title=Past Presidents of National Sheriff's Association|publisher=sheriffs.org|accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act====

In 1995, questions arose when the Caddo Sheriff's department under Hathaway denied a gun permit to a Shreveport liquor store clerk, Philip Russell Coleman. When Coleman was informed of the sheriff's department decision, he told the pawn shop owner where he intended to buy a weapon that he would go to see the deputies in an attempt to resolve the matter, which Coleman assumed was a "mistake". Before Coleman could get his weapon permit, however, he was shot to death in a holdup. Hathaway said that there was apparently justification for initially denying Coleman's application but that when Coleman came to the office, his application was approved. National radio commentator [[Paul Harvey]] aired the Coleman story on one of his broadcasts. Many used the Coleman case to show the unintended consequences of the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act]] of 1993, which requires a waiting period for background checks for citizens seeking to purchase handguns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoboes.com/pub/Firearms/Books%20and%20News/Gun%20Control%20Kills/Dying%20for%20a%20Waiting%20Period/|title=Murdered Clerk Had Sought Handgun for Protection|author=Dunstan Prial|date=August 17, 1995|publisher=''The Shreveport Times''|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[judiciary|judicial]] '''executioner''', also known as a "public executioner", is a person who officially inflicts [[capital punishment]] ordered by the [[State (polity)|state]] or other [[law|legal]] authority, which was known in [[feudal]] terminology as [[high justice]].&lt;ref name="Harrington 2013 p. 27"&gt;{{cite book

== Scope and job ==
The executioner was usually presented with a [[Execution warrant|warrant]] authorizing or ordering him to ''execute'' the sentence. The warrant protects the executioner from the charge of [[murder]]. Common terms for executioners derived from forms of capital punishment—though they often also performed other physical punishments—include ''hangman'' (hanging) and ''headsman'' (beheading). In the military, the role of executioner was performed by a soldier, such as the ''provost''. A common [[stereotype]] of an executioner is a [[hood (headgear)|hooded]] [[medieval]] or absolutist executioner. Symbolic or real, executioners were rarely hooded, and not robed in all black; hoods were only used if an executioner's identity and anonymity were to be preserved from the public. As [[Hilary Mantel]] has pointed out in her 2018 [[Reith Lectures]], "Why would an executioner wear a mask? Everybody knew who he was". 

While this task can be occasional in nature, it can be carried out in the line of more general duty by an officer of the court, the [[police]], [[Corrections officer|prison staff]], or even the [[military]]. A special case is the tradition of the Roman ''fustuarium'', continued in forms of [[running the gauntlet]], where the culprit receives his punishment from the hands of the comrades gravely harmed by his crime, e.g. for failing in vital sentinel duty or stealing from a ship's limited food supply.

Many executioners were professional specialists who traveled a circuit or region performing their duty, because executions were rarely very numerous. Within this region, a resident executioner would also administer [[Corporal punishment|non-lethal physical punishments]], or apply [[torture]]. In [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Europe, to the end of the [[early modern period]], executioners were often [[knacker]]s,&lt;ref name="TFTGU"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; since pay from the rare executions was not enough to live off.

The term is extended to administrators of severe physical punishment that is not prescribed to kill, but which may result in death.

Executions in France (using the [[guillotine]] since the [[French Revolution]]) persisted until 1977, and the French Republic had an official executioner; the last one, [[Marcel Chevalier]], served until the formal [[Capital punishment in France#The abolition process in 1981|abolition of capital punishment]] in 1981.&lt;ref name="Clarke Hardy Williams 2008"&gt;{{cite book

== In society ==
In [[Western Europe]] and its colonies, [[List of executioners|executioners]] were often shunned by their neighbours, with their work as knackers also disreputable.&lt;ref name="TFTGU" /&gt; In [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]]' ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' and in the film ''[[La veuve de Saint-Pierre]]'' (''The Widow of Saint-Peter''), minor character executioners are [[Ostracism|ostracized]] by the villagers.

The profession of executioner sometimes ran through a family, especially in France, where the [[Charles Henri Sanson|Sanson family]] provided six executioners between 1688 and 1847 and the Deibler dynasty provided five between 1879 and its 1981 abolition. The latter's members included Louis Deibler, his son Anatole, Anatole's nephew Jules-Henri Desfourneaux, his other nephew [[André Obrecht]], and André's nephew [[Marcel Chevalier]].&lt;ref name="Gerould 1992 p. 78"&gt;{{cite book

In Britain, the most notable dynasty was the Pierrepoints, who provided three executioners between 1902 and 1956 – Henry, his brother Thomas, and Henry's son [[Albert Pierrepoint|Albert]]. Unlike in France and many other European countries, far from being shunned, British executioners such as [[William Marwood]], [[James Berry (executioner)|James Berry]], Albert Pierrepoint, and [[Harry Allen (executioner)|Harry Allen]] were widely known and respected by the public.

In Japan, executioners have been held in contempt as part of the [[burakumin]] class (today executions in Japan are not carried out by professional executioners, but by prison guards). In ''Memories of Silk and Straw'', by Junichi Saga, one of the families surveyed in the Japanese village of Tsuchiura is that of an executioner family ("The Last Executioner", p. 54).  This family does suffer social isolation, even though the family is somewhat well-off financially.

In the [[Ottoman Empire]], only [[Romani people|Romani]] could be executioners. Executioners were seen as "damned" people and even their graveyards were separate from public graveyards. There were no inscriptions on executioner tombstones, and usually uncarved and unpolished simple rough stones were used. One of the oldest and largest "executioner graveyards" is in the Eyüp district in Istanbul. After the republican revolution in Turkey, executions continued to be performed by Romani executioners. This situation continued until the abolition of capital punishment in Turkey.

The lack of societal disregard for executioners in places like North America may be attributed to the infrequency of executions in modern times, and to the anonymity provided by a decrease in their public showings.

[[Image:Bill of Rights Pg1of1 AC.jpg|190px|thumb|The Bill of Rights in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]]]
The '''Fourth Amendment''' ('''Amendment IV''') to the [[United States Constitution]] is part of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. It prohibits unreasonable [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]]. In addition, it sets requirements for issuing [[Warrant (law)|warrants]]: warrants must be issued by a judge or magistrate, justified by [[probable cause]], supported by oath or affirmation, and must particularly describe the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.

Fourth Amendment case law deals with three main issues: what government activities are "searches" and "seizures," what constitutes probable cause to conduct searches and seizures, and how violations of Fourth Amendment rights should be addressed. Early court decisions limited the amendment's scope to physical intrusion of property or persons, but with ''[[Katz v. United States]]'' (1967), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held that its protections extend to intrusions on the privacy of individuals as well as to physical locations. A warrant is needed for most search and seizure activities, but the Court has carved out a series of exceptions for [[consent search]]es, [[Motor vehicle exception|motor vehicle searches]], [[Plain view doctrine|evidence in plain view]], [[Exigent circumstance in United States law|exigent circumstances]], [[Border search exception|border searches]], and other situations.

The [[exclusionary rule]] is one way the amendment is enforced. Established in ''[[Weeks v. United States]]'' (1914), this rule holds that [[evidence]] obtained as a result of a Fourth Amendment violation is generally [[Admissible evidence|inadmissible]] at criminal trials. Evidence discovered as a later result of an illegal search may also be inadmissible as "[[fruit of the poisonous tree]]", unless it inevitably would have been discovered by legal means.

The Fourth Amendment was adopted in response to the abuse of the [[writ of assistance]], a type of general [[search warrant]] issued by the [[British Empire|British government]], and a major source of tension in [[American Revolution|pre-Revolutionary America]]. The Fourth Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by [[James Madison]], along with the other amendments in the Bill of Rights, in response to [[Anti-Federalist]] objections to the new Constitution. Congress [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Proposing amendments|submitted]] the amendment to the states on September 28, 1789. By December 15, 1791, the necessary three-fourths of the states had [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Ratification of amendments|ratified]] it. On March 1, 1792, Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]] announced that it was officially part of the Constitution.

Because the Bill of Rights did not initially apply to state or local governments, and federal criminal investigations were less common in the first century of the nation's history, there is little significant case law for the Fourth Amendment before the 20th century. The amendment was held to [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|apply to state and local governments]] in ''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]'' (1961) via the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].

== Background ==

===English law===
[[File:Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden by Nathaniel Dance, (later Sir Nathaniel Dance-Holland, Bt).jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden]] established the English common law precedent against general search warrants.]]
Like many other areas of American law, the Fourth Amendment finds its roots in English legal doctrine. In ''[[Semayne's case]]'' (1604), [[Sir Edward Coke]] famously stated: "The house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress, as well for his defence against injury and violence as for his repose."&lt;ref&gt;Coke's Rep. 91a, 77 Eng. Rep. 194 (K.B. 1604)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Semayne's Case'' acknowledged that the King did not have unbridled authority to intrude on his subjects' dwellings, but recognized that government agents were permitted to conduct searches and seizures under certain conditions when their purpose was lawful and a warrant had been obtained.{{sfnp|Kilman|Costello|2006|p=1281–1282}}

The 1760s saw a growth in the intensity of litigation against state officers, who, using general warrants, conducted raids in search of materials relating to [[John Wilkes]]'s publications attacking both government policies and the King himself. The most famous of these cases involved [[John Entick]], whose home was forcibly entered by the [[Queen's Messenger|King's Messenger]] Nathan Carrington, along with others, pursuant to a warrant issued by [[George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax]] authorizing them "to make strict and diligent search for&amp;nbsp;... the author, or one concerned in the writing of several weekly very seditious papers entitled, 'The Monitor or British Freeholder, No 257, 357, 358, 360, 373, 376, 378, and 380,'" and seized printed charts, pamphlets and other materials. Entick filed suit in ''[[Entick v Carrington]]'', argued before the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]] in 1765. [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden]] ruled that both the search and the seizure were unlawful, as the warrant authorized the seizure of ''all'' of Entick's papers—not just the criminal ones—and as the warrant lacked [[probable cause]] to even justify the search. By holding that "[O]ur law holds the property of every man so sacred, that no man can set his foot upon his neighbour's close without his leave",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Entick v Carrington]]'', 2 Wils. K. B. 275, 291; 95 Eng. Rep. 807, 817 (K. B. 1765)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Entick'' established the English precedent that the executive is limited in intruding on private property by [[English law#Common law|common law]].{{sfnp|Kilman|Costello|2006|p=1281–1282}}

==={{anchor|Colonial United States}}Colonial America===
Homes in [[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial America]], on the other hand, did not enjoy the same sanctity as their British counterparts, because legislation had been explicitly written so as to enable enforcement of British revenue-gathering policies on customs; until 1750, in fact, the only type of warrant defined in the handbooks for justices of the peace was the general warrant.{{sfnp|Kilman|Costello|2006|p=1281–1282}} During what scholar William Cuddihy called the "colonial epidemic of general searches", the authorities possessed almost unlimited power to search for anything at any time, with very little oversight.{{sfnp|Levy|1995|p=150}}

[[Image:James Otis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Massachusetts lawyer [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] protested British use of general warrants in the American colonies.]]
In 1756, the colony of Massachusetts barred the use of general warrants. This represented the first law in American history curtailing the use of seizure power. Its creation largely stemmed from the great public outcry over the Excise Act of 1754, which gave tax collectors unlimited powers to interrogate colonists concerning their use of goods subject to customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuqua|first=David|date=Fall 2014|title=Technology and the Fourth Amendment: History and Application of Principles of Decision in Light of New Means of Surveillance.|url=https://libproxy.berkeley.edu/login?qurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ebscohost.com%2flogin.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26db%3dbth%26AN%3d97506316%26site%3deds-live|journal=FDCC Quarterly|volume=64|pages=2-25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act also permitted the use of a general warrant known as a [[writ of assistance]], allowing tax collectors to search the homes of colonists and seize "prohibited and uncustomed" goods.{{sfnp|Davies|1999}}
A crisis erupted over the writs of assistance on December 27, 1760, when the news of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]'s death on October 23 arrived in Boston. All writs automatically expired six months after the death of the King, and would have had to be re-issued by [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], the new king, to remain valid.{{sfnp|Wroth|Zobel|1965|p=113, fn 22|ps=: "The writs of assistance did not become an issue until news of King George II's death arrived in Boston December 27, 1760."}}

In mid-January 1761, a group of over 50 merchants represented by [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] petitioned the court to have hearings on the issue. During the five-hour hearing on February 23, 1761, Otis vehemently denounced British colonial policies, including their sanction of general warrants and writs of assistance.{{sfnp|Wroth|Zobel|1965|p=113, fn 23}} However, the court ruled against Otis.{{sfnp|Lasson|1937|p=57–61}} Future US President [[John Adams]], who was present in the courtroom when Otis spoke, viewed these events as "the spark in which originated the American Revolution."{{sfnp|Adams|Adams|1856|p=59}}

Because of the name he had made for himself in attacking the writs, Otis was elected to the [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts colonial legislature]] and helped pass legislation requiring that special writs of assistance be "granted by any judge or justice of the peace upon information under oath by any officer of the customs" and barring all other writs. The governor overturned the legislation, finding it contrary to English law and parliamentary sovereignty.{{sfnp|Lasson|1937|p=66}}

Seeing the danger general warrants presented, the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] (1776) explicitly forbade the use of general warrants. This prohibition became a precedent for the Fourth Amendment:{{sfnp|Levy|1995|p=161}}

{{quote|That general warrants, whereby any officer or messenger may be commanded to search suspected places without evidence of a fact committed, or to seize any person or persons not named, or whose offense is not particularly described and supported by evidence, are grievous and oppressive and ought not to be granted.{{sfnp|Levy|1995|p=161}}}}

Article XIV of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, written by John Adams and enacted in 1780 as part of the Massachusetts Constitution, added the requirement that all searches must be "reasonable," and served as another basis for the language of the Fourth Amendment:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gonzagalawreview.org/files/2011/01/45-Gonz-L-Rev-1.pdf|title=The Originalist Case for the Fourth Amendment Exclusionary Rule|last=Roots|first=Roger|page=20 (fn. 118)|date=January 13, 2010|publisher=Gonzaga Law Review|accessdate=January 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Every subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches, and seizures of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions. All warrants, therefore, are contrary to this right, if the cause or foundation of them be not previously supported by oath or affirmation; and if the order in the warrant to a civil officer, to make search in suspected places, or to arrest one or more suspected persons, or to seize their property, be not accompanied with a special designation of the persons or objects of search, arrest, or seizure: and no warrant ought to be issued but in cases, and with the formalities, prescribed by the laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/legis/const.htm|title=Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By 1784, eight state constitutions contained a provision against general warrants.&lt;ref name=Cuddihy/&gt;

== Proposal and ratification ==
{{main|United States Bill of Rights}}
After several years of comparatively weak government under the [[Articles of Confederation]], a [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring a stronger chief executive and other changes. [[George Mason]], a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed that a bill of rights listing and guaranteeing [[civil liberties]] be included. Other delegates&amp;mdash;including future Bill of Rights drafter [[James Madison]]&amp;mdash;disagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked the implication that other, unnamed rights were unprotected. After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations.{{sfnp|Beeman|2009|p=341&amp;ndash;43}}

For the constitution to be ratified, however, nine of the thirteen states were required to approve it in state conventions. Opposition to ratification ("Anti-Federalism") was partly based on the Constitution's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for the addition of a bill of rights.{{sfnp|Maier|2010|p=431}} Four state conventions proposed some form of restriction on the authority of the new federal government to conduct searches.&lt;ref name=Cuddihy&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425001007.html |title=Fourth Amendment, Historical Origins of |last=Cuddihy |first=William |year=1986 |work=Encyclopedia of the American Constitution |publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Madison.jpg|thumb|[[James Madison]], drafter of the Bill of Rights]]
In the [[1st United States Congress]], following the state legislatures' request, James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments based on state bills of rights and English sources such as the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], including an amendment requiring probable cause for government searches. Congress reduced Madison's proposed twenty amendments to twelve, with modifications to Madison's language about searches and seizures.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendIVs13.html Amendment IV]", ''The Founders Constitution'', University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, John D.  (III).  "Egbert Benson: A Nationalist in Congress", in ''Neither Separate Nor Equal: Congress in the 1790s'', pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NzjaxV8oDpMC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70 69-73] (edited by Kenneth R. Bowling and Donald R. Kennon of the United States Capitol Historical Society, published by Ohio University Press in 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  The final language was submitted to the states for ratification on September 25, 1789.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights.html |title=Bill of Rights |publisher=National Archives |accessdate=April 4, 2013 |archivedate=April 4, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Fcz4pEP4?url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights.html |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the Bill of Rights was submitted to the states for ratification, opinions had shifted in both parties. Many Federalists, who had previously opposed a Bill of Rights, now supported the Bill as a means of silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective criticism. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, now opposed it, realizing that the Bill's adoption would greatly lessen the chances of a second constitutional convention, which they desired.{{sfnp|Wood|2009|p=71}} Anti-Federalists such as [[Richard Henry Lee]] also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt;

On November 20, 1789, New Jersey ratified eleven of the twelve amendments, including the Fourth. On December 19, 1789, December 22, 1789, and January 19, 1790, respectively, Maryland, North Carolina, and South Carolina ratified all twelve amendments.{{sfnp|Labunski|2006|p=245}} On January 25 and 28, 1790, respectively, New Hampshire and Delaware ratified eleven of the Bill's twelve amendments, including the Fourth.{{sfnp|Labunski|2006|p=245}} This brought the total of ratifying states to six of the required ten, but the process stalled in other states: Connecticut and Georgia found a Bill of Rights unnecessary and so refused to ratify, while Massachusetts ratified most of the amendments, but failed to send official notice to the Secretary of State that it had done so. (All three states would later ratify the Bill of Rights for sesquicentennial celebrations in 1939.)&lt;ref name=Levy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425000220.html |title=Bill of Rights (United States)|author=Levy, Leonard W.|year=1986|work=Encyclopedia of the American Constitution|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February through June 1790, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island each ratified eleven of the amendments, including the Fourth. Virginia initially postponed its debate, but after Vermont was admitted to the Union in 1791, the total number of states needed for ratification rose to eleven. Vermont ratified on November 3, 1791, approving all twelve amendments, and Virginia finally followed on December 15, 1791.&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt; Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]] announced the adoption of the ten successfully ratified amendments on March 1, 1792.{{sfnp|Labunski|2006|p=255}}

==Applicability==
The Bill of Rights originally only restricted the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], and went through a long initial phase of "judicial dormancy";{{sfnp|Labunski|2006|p=258&amp;ndash;59}} in the words of historian [[Gordon S. Wood]], "After ratification, most Americans promptly forgot about the first ten amendments to the Constitution."{{sfnp|Wood|2009|p=72}} Federal jurisdiction regarding criminal law was narrow until the late 19th century when the [[Interstate Commerce Act]] and [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] were passed. As federal criminal jurisdiction expanded to include other areas such as [[narcotic]]s, more questions about the Fourth Amendment came to the Supreme Court.{{sfnp|Lasson|1937|p=106}} The U.S. Supreme Court responded to these questions by outlining the fundamental purpose of the amendment as guaranteeing "the privacy, dignity and security of persons against certain arbitrary and invasive acts by officers of the Government, without regard to whether the government actor is investigating crime or performing another function".&lt;ref name="Ontario v. Quon"&gt;''[[Ontario v. Quon]]'', 130 S.Ct. 2619, {{ussc|560|746|2010|docket=08-1332}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]'' (1961),&lt;ref name=Mapp&gt;''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|367|643|1961}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that the Fourth Amendment [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|applies to the states]] by way of the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425001584.html|title=''Mapp v. Ohio''|author=Landynski, Jacob W.|year=1986|work=Encyclopedia of the American Constitution|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth Amendment case law deals with three central issues: what government activities constitute "search" and "seizure"; what constitutes [[probable cause]] for these actions; how violations of Fourth Amendment rights should be addressed.&lt;ref name=Arenella&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425001005.html|title=Fourth Amendment|author=Arenella, Peter|year=1992|work=Encyclopedia of the American Constitution|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fourth Amendment typically requires "a neutral and detached authority interposed between the police and the public", and it is offended by "general warrants" and laws that allows searches to be conducted "indiscriminately and without regard to their connection with [a] crime under investigation",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Berger v. New York]]'', {{Ussc|388|41|1967|pin=54,59}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for the "basic purpose of the Fourth Amendment, which is enforceable against the States through the Fourteenth, through its prohibition of 'unreasonable' searches and seizures is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Camara v. Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco]]'', {{ussc|387|523|1967}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fourth Amendment has been held to mean that a search or an arrest generally requires a judicially sanctioned [[Warrant (law)|warrant]], because the basic rule under the Fourth Amendment is that arrests and "searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are ''per se'' unreasonable".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Arizona v. Gant]]'', {{ussc|556|332|2009}}, at page 338.&lt;/ref&gt; In order for such a warrant to be considered reasonable, it must be supported by probable cause and be limited in scope according to specific information supplied by a person (usually a law enforcement officer) who has [[Affidavit|sworn by it]] and is therefore [[Perjury|accountable to the issuing court]]. The Supreme Court further held in ''[[Chandler v. Miller]]'' (1997): "To be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, a search ordinarily must be based on individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. But particularized exceptions to the main rule are sometimes warranted based on 'special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement'.&amp;nbsp;… When such 'special needs' are alleged, courts must undertake a context-specific inquiry, examining closely the competing private and public interests advanced by the parties."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chandler v. Miller]]'', {{ussc|520|305|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment applies to governmental searches and seizures, but not those done by private citizens or organizations who are not acting on behalf of a government.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Jacobsen]]'', {{ussc|466|109|1984}}: "This Court has&amp;nbsp;… consistently construed this protection as proscribing only governmental action; it is wholly inapplicable to a search or seizure, even an unreasonable one, effected by a private individual not acting as an agent of the Government or with the participation or knowledge of any governmental official." (punctuation omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Ontario v. Quon]]'' (2010), the Court held the amendment to also apply to the government when acting as an employer, ruling that a government could search a police officer's text messages that were sent over that government's pager.&lt;ref name="Ontario v.

===Search===
[[File:US Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart - 1976 official portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Potter Stewart]] wrote the majority decision in ''[[Katz v. United States]]'', which expanded Fourth Amendment protections to electronic surveillance.]]
One threshold question in the Fourth Amendment jurisprudence is whether a "search" has occurred. Initial Fourth Amendment case law hinged on  a citizen's [[property rights]]—that is, when the government physically intrudes on "persons, houses, papers, or effects" for the purpose of obtaining information, a "search" within the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment has occurred. Early 20th-century Court decisions, such as ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'' (1928), held that Fourth Amendment rights applied in cases of physical intrusion, but not to other forms of police surveillance (e.g., wiretaps).&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425001430.html |title=''Katz v. United States'' 389 U.S. 347 (1967)|author=Schwartz, Herman|year=1986|work=Encyclopedia of the American Constitution|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Silverman v. United States]]'' (1961), the Court stated of the amendment that "at the very core stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Silverman v. United States]]'', {{ussc|365|505|1961|pin=511}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth Amendment protections expanded significantly with ''[[Katz v. United States]]'' (1967).&lt;ref name=Katz /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Katz v. United States]]'', {{ussc|389|347|1967}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Katz'', the Supreme Court expanded that focus to embrace an individual's [[right to privacy]], and ruled that a search had occurred when the government wiretapped a [[telephone booth]] using a microphone attached to the outside of the glass. While there was no physical intrusion into the booth, the Court reasoned that: 1) Katz, by entering the booth and shutting the door behind him, had exhibited his expectation that "the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world"; and 2) society believes that his expectation was [[Reasonable person|reasonable]]. Justice [[Potter Stewart]] wrote in the majority opinion that "the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places".&lt;ref&gt;''Katz'', 389 U.S. at 351.&lt;/ref&gt; A "search" occurs for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when the government violates a person's "reasonable expectation of privacy".&lt;ref&gt;''Katz'', 389 U.S. at 351; at 360-61 (Harlan, J., concurring)&lt;/ref&gt; Katz's reasonable [[expectation of privacy]] thus provided the basis to rule that the government's intrusion, though electronic rather than physical, was a search covered by the Fourth Amendment, and thus necessitated a warrant.&lt;ref name=Katz /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lure&gt;{{cite book|last=Schroeder|first=Steve|title=The Lure: The True Story of How the Department of Justice Brought Down Two of the World's Most Dangerous Cyber Criminals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_XULAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127|year=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-4354-5713-7|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court said that it was not recognizing any general right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment,&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Candace. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=HV8hITArW9MC&amp;pg=PA41 Challenges and Issues Today]" in ''Intellectual Freedom Manual'', pp.&amp;nbsp;41–42 (American Library Association, Office for Intellectual Freedom, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; and that this wiretap could have been authorized if proper procedures had been followed.&lt;ref name=Lure /&gt;

This decision in ''Katz'' was later developed into the now commonly used two-prong test, adopted in ''[[Smith v. Maryland]]'' (1979),&lt;ref name="Smith v. Maryland"&gt;''[[Smith v. Maryland]]'', {{ussc|442|735|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for determining whether a search has occurred for purposes of the Fourth Amendment:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://stlr.stanford.edu/pdf/freiwald-first-principles.pdf|title=First Principles of Communications Privacy|first=Susan|last=Freiwald|journal=Stanford Technology Law Review|year=2007|issue=3|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617132308/http://stlr.stanford.edu/pdf/freiwald-first-principles.pdf|archivedate=June 17, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sorosky, Schuyler.

Maryland'', 442 U.S. 735, 743-44 (1979); ''United States v. Miller'', 425 U.S. 435, 440-41 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Smith v.

Maryland"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Smith'', 442 U.S. at 742.&lt;/ref&gt; However, under ''[[Carpenter v. United States]]'' (2018), individuals do have a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding cell phone records that would reveal where that person had traveled over many months and so law enforcement must get a search warrant before obtaining such records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2018/06/opinion-analysis-court-holds-that-police-will-generally-need-a-warrant-for-cellphone-location-information/|title=Opinion analysis: Court holds that police will generally need a warrant for cellphone location information|last=Howe|first=Amy|date=June 22, 2018|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''Katz'', the vast majority of Fourth Amendment search cases have turned on the right to privacy, but in ''[[United States v. Jones (2012)|United States v. Jones]]'' (2012), the Court ruled that the ''Katz'' standard did not replace earlier case law, but rather, has supplemented it.&lt;ref name=Jones2012&gt;''[[United States v. Jones (2012)|United States v. Jones]]'', {{ussc|565||2012|docket=10-1259}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Jones'', law enforcement officers had attached a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] device on a car's exterior without Jones' knowledge or consent. The Court concluded that Jones was a [[Bailment|bailee]] to the car, and so had a property interest in the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/01/opinion-recap-tight-limit-on-police-gps-use/|title=Opinion recap: Tight limit on police GPS use|last=Denniston|first=Lyle|date=January 23, 2012|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, since the intrusion on the vehicle—a common law [[trespass]]—was for the purpose of obtaining information, the Court ruled that it was a search under the Fourth Amendment. The Court used similar "trespass" reasoning in ''[[Florida v. Jardines]]'' (2013), to rule that bringing a drug [[detection dog]] to sniff at the front door of a home was a search.&lt;ref name=Jardines&gt;''[[Florida v. Jardines]]'', {{ussc|569||2013|docket=11-564}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain situations, law enforcement may perform a search when they have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, even if it falls short of probable cause necessary for an arrest. Under ''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'' (1968), law enforcement officers are permitted to conduct a limited warrantless search on a level of suspicion less than probable cause under certain circumstances. In ''Terry'', the Supreme Court ruled that when a police officer witnesses "unusual conduct" that leads that officer to reasonably believe "that criminal activity may be afoot", that the suspicious person has a weapon ''and'' that the person is presently dangerous to the officer or others, the officer may conduct a "pat-down search" (or "frisk") to determine whether the person is carrying a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|392|1|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; This detention and search is known as a [[Terry stop|''Terry'' stop]]. To conduct a frisk, officers must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425002506.html|title=Terry v. Ohio 392 U.S. 1 (1968) Sibron v.

Royer]]'' (1983), such a search must be temporary, and questioning must be limited to the purpose of the stop (e.g., officers who stop a person because they have reasonable suspicion to believe that the person was driving a stolen car, cannot, after confirming that it is not stolen, compel the person to answer questions about anything else, such as the possession of contraband).&lt;ref name=Royer&gt;''[[Florida v. Royer]]'', {{ussc|460|491|1983|pin=497–98}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Royer2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casebriefs.com/blog/law/criminal-procedure/criminal-procedure-keyed-to-israel/arrest-search-and-seizure/florida-v-royer/2/|title=Florida v. Royer|publisher=casebriefs.com|accessdate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seizure===
The Fourth Amendment proscribes unreasonable seizure of any person, person's home (including its [[curtilage]]) or [[personal property]] without a warrant. A seizure of property occurs when there is "some meaningful interference with an individual's possessory interests in that property",&lt;ref&gt;''Jacobsen'', 466 U.S. at 113.&lt;/ref&gt; such as when police officers take personal property away from an owner to use as evidence, or when they participate in an eviction.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Soldal v. Cook County]]'', {{ussc|506|56|1992|pin=61}}. "The right against unreasonable seizures would be no less transgressed if the seizure of the house was undertaken to collect evidence, verify compliance with a housing regulation, effect an eviction by the police, or on a whim, for no reason at all."&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment also protects against unreasonable seizure of persons, including a brief detention.&lt;ref name="United States v. Mendenhall"/&gt;

A seizure does not occur just because the government questions an individual in a public place. The exclusionary rule would not bar voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution. The person is not being seized if his freedom of movement is not restrained.&lt;ref name=Royer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dunaway v. New York]]'', 442 U.S. 200, 210 n. 12, 99 S.Ct. 2248, 2255 n. 12, 60 L.Ed.2d 824 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds, with few exceptions. His refusal to listen or answer does not by itself furnish such grounds.&lt;ref name="United States v. Mendenhall"/&gt;

In ''[[United States v. Mendenhall]]'' (1980), the Court held that a person is seized only when, by means of physical force ''or'' show of authority, his freedom of movement is restrained and, in the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would believe that he was not free to leave.&lt;ref name="United States v. Mendenhall"&gt;''[[United States v. Mendenhall]]'', {{ussc|446|544|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Florida v. Bostick]]'' (1991), the Court ruled that as long as the police do not convey a message that compliance with their requests is required, the police contact is a "citizen encounter" that falls outside the protections of the Fourth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Florida v. Bostick]]'', {{ussc|501|429|1991|pin=439}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If a person remains free to disregard questioning by the government, there has been no seizure and therefore no intrusion upon the person's privacy under the Fourth Amendment.&lt;ref name="United States v. Mendenhall"/&gt;

When a person is arrested and taken into police custody, he has been seized (i.e., a reasonable person who is handcuffed and placed in the back of a police car would not think they were free to leave). A person subjected to a routine [[traffic stop]] on the other hand, has been seized, but is not "arrested" because traffic stops are a relatively brief encounter and are more analogous to a [[Terry stop|''Terry'' stop]] than to a formal arrest.&lt;ref name="Knowles v. Iowa"&gt;''[[Knowles v. Iowa]]'', {{ussc|525|113|1998|pin=117}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If a person is not under suspicion of illegal behavior, a law enforcement official is not allowed to place an individual under arrest simply because this person does not wish to state his identity, provided specific state regulations do not specify this to be the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moritz|first=Rob|title=Fed appeals court says refusal to identify no cause for arrest|url=http://www.arkansasnews.com/archive/2008/04/05/News/345838.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613195115/http://www.arkansasnews.com/archive/2008/04/05/News/345838.html|archivedate=June 13, 2008|accessdate=April 6, 2012|newspaper=Arkansas News Bureau|date=April 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A search incidental to an arrest that is not permissible under state law does not violate the Fourth Amendment, so long as the arresting officer has probable cause.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Virginia v. Moore]]'', {{ussc|553|164|2008|docket=06-1082}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/judicial/2008-04-23-scotus-search_N.htm|title=Court allows search and seizure in Va. case|work=[[USA Today]]|date=April 23, 2008|accessdate=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Maryland v. King]]'' (2013), the Court upheld the constitutionality of police swabbing for DNA upon arrests for serious crimes, along the same reasoning that allows police to take fingerprints or photographs of those they arrest and detain.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Maryland v. King]]'', {{ussc|569||2013|docket=12-207}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;June, Daniel.

Accessed August 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exceptions====
The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable and articulable suspicion, with a few exceptions. In ''[[Delaware v. Prouse]]'' (1979), the Court ruled an officer has made an illegal seizure when he stops an automobile and detains the driver in order to check his driver's license and the registration of the automobile, unless the officer has articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist is unlicensed or that an automobile is not registered, or either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violation of law.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Delaware v. Prouse]]'', {{ussc|440|648|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425000155.html|title=Automobile search|author=Landynski, Jacob W.|year=1986|work=Encyclopedia of the American Constitution|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where society's need is great, no other effective means of meeting the need is available, and intrusion on people's privacy is minimal, certain discretionless checkpoints toward that end may briefly detain motorists. In ''[[United States v. Martinez-Fuerte]]'' (1976), the Supreme Court allowed discretionless immigration checkpoints.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Martinez-Fuerte]]'', {{ussc|428|543|1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz]]'' (1990), the Supreme Court allowed discretionless sobriety checkpoints.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz]]'' {{ussc|496|444|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Illinois v. Lidster]]'' (2004), the Supreme Court allowed focused informational checkpoints.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Illinois v. Lidster]]'', {{ussc|source=f|540|419|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''[[City of Indianapolis v. Edmond]]'' (2000), the Supreme Court ruled that discretionary checkpoints or general crime-fighting checkpoints are not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;''[[City of Indianapolis v. Edmond]]'', {{ussc|531|32|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warrant===
Under the Fourth Amendment, law enforcement must receive written permission from a court of law, or otherwise qualified [[magistrate]], to lawfully search and seize evidence while investigating criminal activity. A court grants permission by issuing a [[writ]] known as a warrant. A search or seizure is generally unreasonable and unconstitutional if conducted without a valid warrant&lt;ref&gt;''[[Maryland v. Dyson]]'', {{ussc|527|465|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the police must obtain a warrant whenever practicable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court |litigants=Andrews v. Fuoss |vol=417 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=813 |pinpoint= |court=8th Cir. |date=2005 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=40000006&amp;case=2225498566309744665&amp;scilh=0 |accessdate=February 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Searches and seizures without a warrant are not considered unreasonable if one of the specifically established and well-delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement applies.&lt;ref name=Katz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Flippo v. West Virginia'', {{ussc|528|11|1999}}; ''[[California v. Acevedo]]'', {{ussc|500|565|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TLO&gt;''[[New Jersey v. T. L. O.]]'', ''{{ussc|469|325|1985}}''. "[W]arrantless searches are per se unreasonable, subject only to a few specifically delineated and well-recognized exceptions.&amp;nbsp;... full-scale searches – whether conducted in accordance with the warrant requirement or pursuant to one of its exceptions – are 'reasonable' in Fourth Amendment terms only on a showing of probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that evidence of the crime will be found in the place to be searched."&lt;/ref&gt; These exceptions apply "[o]nly in those exceptional circumstances in which special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and probable cause requirement impracticable".&lt;ref&gt;''T. L. O.'', 469 U.S., [[Harry Blackmun|Blackmun, J.]], concurring.&lt;/ref&gt;

In these situations where the warrant requirement doesn't apply a search or seizure nonetheless must be justified by some individualized suspicion of wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keeley III.|first=Charles J.|title=Article 8 - Subway Searches: Which Exception to the Warrant and Probable Cause Requirements Applies to Suspicionless Searches of Mass Transit Passengers To Prevent Terrorism?|journal=Fordham Law Review|year=2006|volume=74|issue=6|page=3236|accessdate=December 28, 2013|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4178&amp;context=flr}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the U.S. Supreme Court carved out an exception to the requirement of individualized suspicion. It ruled that, "In limited circumstances, where the privacy interests implicated by the search are minimal and where an important governmental interest furthered by the intrusion would be placed in jeopardy by a requirement of individualized suspicion" a search [or seizure] would still be reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Association]]'', {{ussc|489|602|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Probable cause===
{{main|Probable cause}}
The standards of probable cause differ for an arrest and a search. The government has probable cause to make an arrest when "the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information" would lead a prudent person to believe that the arrested person had committed or was committing a crime.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Beck v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|379|89|1964|pin=91}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Probable cause to arrest must exist before the arrest is made. Evidence obtained after the arrest may not apply retroactively to justify the arrest.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Johnson v. United States (1948)|Johnson v. United States]]'', {{ussc|333|10|1948}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When police conduct a search, the amendment requires that the warrant establish probable cause to believe that the search will uncover criminal activity or contraband. They must have legally sufficient reasons to believe a search is necessary. In ''[[Carroll v. United States]]'' (1925), the Supreme Court stated that probable cause to search is a flexible, common-sense standard.&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;''[[Carroll v. United States]]'', {{ussc|267|132|1925}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425000387.html |title=''Carroll v.

United States]]'' (1925) that the term probable cause means "less than evidence that would justify condemnation",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dumbra v. United States]]'', {{ussc|268|435|1925}}.&lt;/ref&gt; reiterating ''Carroll''{{'}}s assertion that it merely requires that the facts available to the officer would "warrant a man of reasonable caution" in the belief that specific items may be contraband or stolen property or useful as evidence of a crime.&lt;ref&gt;''Carroll'', 267 U.S. at 162.&lt;/ref&gt; It does not demand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false. A "practical, non-technical" probability that incriminating evidence is involved is all that is required.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Texas v. Brown]]'', {{ussc|460|730|1983|pin=742}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Illinois v. Gates]]'' (1983), the Court ruled that the reliability of an informant is to be determined based on the "[[totality of the circumstances]]".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Illinois v. Gates]]'', {{ussc|462|213|1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exceptions to the warrant requirement==

===Consent===
{{main|Consent search}}
If a [[Party (law)|party]] gives consent to a search, a warrant is not required. There are exceptions and complications to the rule, including the scope of the consent given, whether the consent is voluntarily given, and whether an individual has the right to consent to a search of another's property.&lt;ref&gt;Holcomb, J. W. (March 2003).[http://www2.fbi.gov/publications/leb/2003/mar03leb.pdf Obtaining Written Consent to Search]. ''FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin''&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[Schneckloth v. Bustamonte]]'' (1973), the Court ruled that a consent search is still valid even if the police do not inform a suspect of his right to refuse the search.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Schneckloth v. Bustamonte]]'', {{ussc|412|218|1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment rights]], which cannot be relinquished without an explicit [[Miranda warning|''Miranda'' warning]] from police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425002231.html |title=''Schneckloth v.

The Court stated in ''[[United States v. Matlock]]'' (1974) that a third party co-occupant could give consent for a search without violating a suspect's Fourth Amendment rights.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Matlock]]'', {{ussc|415|164|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Crawford /&gt; However, in ''[[Georgia v. Randolph]]'' (2006), the Supreme Court ruled that when two co-occupants are both present, one consenting and the other rejecting the search of a shared residence, the police may not make a search of that residence within the consent exception to the warrant requirement.&lt;ref&gt;''Georgia v. Randolph'', {{ussc|547|103|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Per the Court's ruling in ''[[Illinois v. Rodriguez]]'' (1990),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Illinois v. Rodriguez]]'', {{ussc|497|177|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a consent search is still considered valid if police accept in good faith the consent of an "apparent authority", even if that party is later discovered to not have authority over the property in question.&lt;ref name=Crawford&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18701410.html |title=Consent searches: guidelines for officers|author=Crawford, Kimberly A.|date=August 1, 1996|work=The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A telling case on this subject is ''Stoner v. California'', in which the Court held that police officers could not rely in good faith upon the apparent authority of a hotel clerk to consent to the search of a guest's room.&lt;ref&gt;''Stoner v. California'', {{ussc|376|483|1969}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plain view and open fields ===
{{main|Plain view doctrine|Open-fields doctrine}}
According to the plain view doctrine as defined in ''[[Coolidge v. New Hampshire]]'' (1971),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Coolidge v. New Hampshire]]'', {{ussc|403|443|1971}}.&lt;/ref&gt; if an officer is lawfully present, he may seize objects that are in "plain view". However, the officer must have had probable cause to believe that the objects are contraband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425001924.html|title=Plain View Doctrine|author=Landynski, Jacob W.|year=1986|work=Encyclopedia of the American Constitution|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; What's more, the criminality of the object in plain view must be obvious by its very nature. In ''[[Arizona v. Hicks]]'', the Supreme Court held that an officer stepped beyond the plain view doctrine when he moved a turntable in order to view its serial number to confirm that the turntable was stolen.&lt;ref&gt;''Arizona v. Hicks'', 480 U.S. 321 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; "A search is a search", proclaimed the Court, "even if it happens to disclose nothing but the bottom of a turntable."&lt;ref&gt;480 U.S. 321, 325 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, "open fields" such as pastures, open water, and woods may be searched without a warrant, on the ground that conduct occurring therein would have no reasonable expectation of privacy. The doctrine was first articulated by the Court in ''[[Hester v. United States]]'' (1924), which stated that "the special protection accorded by the Fourth Amendment to the people in their 'persons, houses, papers, and effects,' is not extended to the open fields."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hester v. United States]]'', {{ussc|265|57|1924}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Oliver v. United States]]'' (1984),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oliver v. United States]]'', {{ussc|466|170|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the police ignored a "no trespassing" sign and a fence, trespassed onto the suspect's land without a warrant, followed a path for hundreds of feet, and discovered a field of marijuana. The Supreme Court ruled that no search had taken place, because there was no privacy expectation regarding an open field:

{{quote|open fields do not provide the setting for those intimate activities that the Amendment is intended to shelter from government interference or surveillance. There is no societal interest in protecting the privacy of those activities, such as the cultivation of crops, that occur in open fields.&lt;ref&gt;''Oliver'', 466 U.S. at 179.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While open fields are not protected by the Fourth Amendment, the [[curtilage]], or outdoor area immediately surrounding the home, is protected. Courts have treated this area as an extension of the house and as such subject to all the privacy protections afforded a person's home (unlike a person's open fields) under the Fourth Amendment. The curtilage is "intimately linked to the home, both physically and psychologically," and is where "privacy expectations are most heightened."&lt;ref&gt;''[[California v. Ciraolo]]'', {{ussc|476|207|1986|pin=213}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, courts have held aerial surveillance of curtilage not to be included in the protections from unwarranted search so long as the airspace above the curtilage is generally accessible by the public. An area is curtilage if it "harbors the intimate activity associated with the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life."&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Dunn]]'', {{ussc|480|294|1987|pin=300}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Courts make this determination by examining "whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home, the nature of the uses to which the area is put, and the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by."&lt;ref&gt;''Dunn'', 480 U.S. at 301.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court has acknowledged that a doorbell or knocker is typically treated as an invitation, or license, to the public to approach the front door of the home to deliver mail, sell goods, solicit for charities, etc. This license extends to the police, who have the right to try engaging a home's occupant in a "[[knock and talk]]" for the purpose of gathering evidence without a warrant. However, they cannot bring a drug detection dog to sniff at the front door of a home without either a warrant or consent of the homeowner or resident.&lt;ref&gt;''Jardines'', 569 U. S. (slip op., at 6). "This implicit license typically permits the visitor to approach the home by the front path, knock promptly, wait briefly to be received, and then (absent invitation to linger longer) leave. Complying with the terms of that traditional invitation does not require fine-grained legal knowledge; it is generally managed without incident by the Nation's Girl Scouts and trick-or-treaters."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exigent circumstance===
{{main|Exigent circumstance in United States law}}

Law enforcement officers may also conduct warrantless searches in several types of exigent circumstances where obtaining a warrant is dangerous or impractical. One example is the [[Terry stop]], which allows police to frisk suspects for weapons.&lt;ref name=Exigent /&gt; The Court also allowed a search of arrested persons in ''Weeks v. United States'' (1914) to preserve evidence that might otherwise be destroyed and to ensure suspects were disarmed.&lt;ref name=Exigent /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weeks/&gt; In ''Carroll v. United States'' (1925),&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; the Court ruled that law enforcement officers could search a vehicle that they suspected of carrying contraband without a warrant.&lt;ref name=Exigent /&gt; The Court allowed blood to be drawn without a warrant from drunk-driving suspects in ''[[Schmerber v. California]]'' (1966) on the grounds that the time to obtain a warrant would allow a suspect's [[blood alcohol content]] to reduce,&lt;ref name=Exigent /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Schmerber v. California]]'', {{ussc|384|757|1966}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although this was later modified by ''[[Missouri v. McNeely]]'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Missouri v.

===Motor vehicle===
{{main|Motor vehicle exception}}
The Supreme Court has held that individuals in automobiles have a reduced expectation of privacy, because (1) vehicles generally do not serve as residences or repositories of personal effects, and (2) vehicles "can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which the warrant must be sought."&lt;ref&gt;''Carroll v. United States'', 267 U.S. 132, 153 (1925)&lt;/ref&gt; Vehicles may not be randomly stopped and searched; there must be probable cause or reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Items in plain view may be seized; areas that could potentially hide weapons may also be searched. With probable cause to believe evidence is present, police officers may search any area in the vehicle. However, they may not extend the search to the vehicle's passengers without probable cause to search those passengers or consent from the passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-136166930.html|title=The motor vehicle exception|author=Hendrie, Edward|date=August 1, 2005|work=The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Collins v.

===Searches incident to a lawful arrest===
{{main|Searches incident to a lawful arrest}}
A [[common law]] rule from Great Britain permits searches incident to an arrest without a warrant. This rule has been applied in American law, and has a lengthy common law history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Orin Kerr|Kerr, Orin]] (December 14, 2010) [http://volokh.com/2010/12/14/the-origins-of-the-search-incident-to-arrest-exception/ The Origins of the "Search Incident to Arrest" Exception], ''[[The Volokh Conspiracy]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The justification for such a search is to prevent the arrested individual 1.) from destroying evidence or 2.) using a weapon against the arresting officer by disarming the suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Riley v. California'' - Concerning the Constitutionality of a Warrantless Cell Phone Search Incident to Arrest|url=http://epic.org/amicus/cell-phone/riley/#background|publisher=Electronic Privacy Information Center|accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that "both justifications for the search-incident-to-arrest exception are absent and the rule does not apply", when "there is no possibility" that the suspect could gain access to a weapon or destroy evidence.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Arizona v. Gant]]'', {{ussc|source=f|556|332|2009|pin=339}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Trupiano v. United States]]'' (1948), the Supreme Court held that "a search or seizure without a warrant as an incident to a lawful arrest has always been considered to be a strictly limited right. It grows out of the inherent necessities of the situation at the time of the arrest. But there must be something more in the way of necessity than merely a lawful arrest."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Trupiano v. United States]]'', {{ussc|334|699|1948}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[United States v. Rabinowitz]]'' (1950), the Court reversed ''Trupiano'', holding instead that the officers' opportunity to obtain a warrant was not germane to the reasonableness of a search incident to an arrest. ''Rabinowitz'' suggested that any area within the "immediate control" of the arrestee could be searched, but it did not define the term.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Rabinowitz]]'', {{ussc|339|56|1950}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In deciding ''[[Chimel v. California]]'' (1969), the Supreme Court elucidated its previous decisions. It held that when an arrest is made, it is reasonable for the officer to search the arrestee for weapons and evidence.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chimel v. California]]'', {{ussc|395|752|1969}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''[[Riley v. California]]'' (2014), the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that police must obtain a warrant to search an arrestee's cellular phone.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Riley v. California]]'' {{ussc|573||2014|docket=13-132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court said that earlier Supreme Court decisions permitting searches incident to an arrest without a warrant do not apply to "modern cellphones, which are now such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they were an important feature of human anatomy," and noted that US citizens' cellphones today typically contain "a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives — from the mundane to the intimate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Adam|title=Major Ruling Shields Privacy of Cellphones|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/26/us/supreme-court-cellphones-search-privacy.html?_r=0|accessdate=June 25, 2014|publisher=The New York Times|date=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Charlie Savage, Hannah Fairfield and Josh Williams|title=Between the Lines of the Cellphone Privacy Ruling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/25/us/annotated-supreme-court-cellphone-privacy-decision.html|accessdate=June 25, 2014|publisher=The New York Times|date=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exclusionary rule==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Sheriff]] --&gt;
{{main|Exclusionary rule}}
One way courts enforce the Fourth Amendment is through the use of the exclusionary rule. The rule provides that evidence obtained through a violation of the Fourth Amendment is generally not [[Admissible evidence|admissible]] by the prosecution during the defendant's criminal trial.&lt;ref name=Exclusionary&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425000884.html|title=Exclusionary Rule|author=Levy, Leonard W.|year=1986|work=Encyclopedia of the American Constitution|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court stated in ''[[Elkins v.

Colorado]]'' (1949),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wolf v. Colorado]]'', {{ussc|338|25|1949}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but ''Wolf'' was explicitly overruled in ''Mapp v. Ohio'' (1961),&lt;ref name=Mapp/&gt; making the Fourth Amendment (including the exclusionary rule) applicable in state proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3457000098.html|title=Mapp v.

The exclusionary rule and its effectiveness have often been controversial, particularly since its 1961 application to state proceedings. Critics charge that the rule hampers police investigation and can result in freeing guilty parties convicted on reliable evidence; other critics state that the rule has not been successful in deterring illegal police searches. Proponents argue that the number of criminal convictions overturned under the rule has been minimal and that no other effective mechanism exists to enforce the Fourth Amendment.&lt;ref name=Exclusionary/&gt; In 1982, [[California]] passed a "[[California Proposition 8 (1982)|Victim's Bill of Rights]]" containing a provision to repeal the exclusionary rule; though the bill could not affect federally mandated rights under the Fourth Amendment, it blocked the state courts from expanding these protections further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/21/opinion/california-s-backfire-on-crime.html|title=California's Backfire on Crime|date=June 21, 1982|work=The New York Times|accessdate=July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Crisera|1990|p=1587}}

===Limitations===
Since ''[[United States v. Calandra]]'' (1974),&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Calandra]]'', {{ussc|414|338|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court has repeatedly limited the exclusionary rule.&lt;ref name=Exclusionary/&gt; The Court in ''Calandra'' ruled that [[grand juries]] may use illegally obtained evidence when questioning witnesses, because "the damage to that institution from the unprecedented extension of the exclusionary rule outweighs the benefit of any possible incremental deterrent effect."&lt;ref&gt;''Calandra'', 414 U.S. at 354.&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining the purpose of the rule, the Court said that the rule "is a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved."&lt;ref&gt;''Calandra'', 414 U.S. at 349.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several cases in 1984 further restricted the exclusionary rule:

* In ''[[United States v. Leon]]'' (1984),&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Leon]]'', {{ussc|468|897|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court established the "good faith" exception to the rule, ruling that evidence seized by officers reasonably relying on a warrant was still admissible, even though the warrant was later found to be defective, unless an officer dishonestly or recklessly prepared an affidavit to seek a warrant, the issuing magistrate abandoned his neutrality, or the warrant lacked sufficient particularity.&lt;ref&gt;''Leon'', 468 U.S. at 926.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Court determined in ''[[Nix v. Williams]]'' (1984)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nix v. Williams]]'', {{ussc|467|431|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that "fruit of the poisonous tree" evidence could still be introduced if a prosecutor could demonstrate that it would have been an "inevitable discovery" of legitimate investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425001776.html|title=Nix v.

* In ''[[Segura v. United States]]'' (1984),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Segura v. United States]]'', {{ussc|468|796|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court ruled that evidence illegally found without a search warrant is admissible if the evidence is later found and legally seized based on information independent of the illegal search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-54061501.html|title=The Inevitable Discovery Exception to the Exclusionary Rule|author=Hendrie, Edward M.|date=September 1, 1997|work=The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Arizona v. Evans]]'' (1995)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Arizona v. Evans]]'', {{ussc|514|1|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Herring v. United States]]'' (2009),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Herring v. United States]]'', {{ussc|555|135|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court ruled that the exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence found due to negligence regarding a government database, as long as the arresting police officer relied on that database in "good faith" and the negligence was not pervasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.richmond.edu/jolt/v2i1/stinger.html|title=''Arizona v.

The Supreme Court has also held the exclusionary rule to not apply in the following circumstances:
* evidence illegally seized by a "private actor" (i.e., not a governmental employee)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Burdeau v. McDowell]]'', {{ussc|256|465|1921}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* tax hearings&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Janis]]'', {{ussc|428|433|1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* evidence collected by U.S. Customs agents&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Andreas]]'', {{ussc|463|765|1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* deportation hearings&lt;ref&gt;''[[INS v. Lopez-Mendoza]]'', {{ussc|468|1032|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* evidence seized by probation or parole officers&lt;ref&gt;''[[Griffin v. Wisconsin]]'', {{ussc|483|868|1987}}; ''[[United States v. Knights]]'', {{ussc|534|112|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 16, 2013, in ''[[Klayman v. Obama]]'', a [[United States district court]] ruled that the mass collection of [[metadata]] of Americans' telephone records by the National Security Agency probably violates the Fourth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leon|first=Richard|title=Federal judge rules NSA program is likely unconstitutional|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/federal-judge-rules-nsa-program-is-likely-unconstitutional/668/|accessdate=December 17, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Savage|first=Charlie|title=Judge Questions Legality of N.S.A.

The court stayed the ruling pending a government appeal, recognizing the "significant national security interests at stake in this case and the novelty of the constitutional issues".&lt;ref name="WP20131216"&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge: NSA's collecting of phone records is probably unconstitutional|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/judge-nsas-collecting-of-phone-records-is-likely-unconstitutional/2013/12/16/6e098eda-6688-11e3-a0b9-249bbb34602c_story.html|accessdate=December 17, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=December 16, 2013|author1=Ellen Nakashima|author2=Ann E.

However, in ''[[ACLU v. Clapper]]'', a United States district court ruled that the U.S. government's global telephone data-gathering system is needed to thwart potential terrorist attacks, and that it can only work if everyone's calls are included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pauley III|first=William H.|title=United States District Court Southern District of New York: American Civil Liberties Union v. James R. Clapper (13 Civ. 3994) (WHP))|url=https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/order_granting_governments_motion_to_dismiss_and_denying_aclu_motion_for_preliminary_injunction.pdf|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=December 28, 2013|date=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court also ruled that Congress legally set up the program and that it does not violate anyone's constitutional rights. The court concluded that the telephone data being swept up by NSA did not belong to telephone users, but to the telephone companies. Also, the court held that when NSA obtains such data from the telephone companies, and then probes into it to find links between callers and potential terrorists, this further use of the data was not even a search under the Fourth Amendment, concluding that the controlling precedent is ''[[Smith v. Maryland]]'', saying "Smith's bedrock holding is that an individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information provided to third parties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Upholds N.S.A.'s Bulk Collection of Data on Calls|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/us/nsa-phone-surveillance-is-lawful-federal-judge-rules.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=December 28, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 27, 2013|author1=Adam Liptak|author2=Michael S.

"The government has a legitimate interest in tracking the associations of suspected terrorists, but tracking those associations does not require the government to subject every citizen to permanent surveillance," deputy ACLU legal director Jameel Jaffer said in a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ackermann|first=Spencer|title=ACLU will appeal ruling that NSA bulk phone record collection is legal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/02/aclu-appeal-nsa-bulk-phone-record-collection|accessdate=January 4, 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GenerationAdidas.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Generation Adidas official logo]]
'''Generation Adidas''' is a joint venture between [[Major League Soccer]] and [[United States Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer]] aimed at raising the level of young professional [[football (soccer)|soccer]] talent in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/354854/us-u-20-players-headline-2006-class|title=U.S. U-20 players headline 2006 class|author=|date=|website=ESPNFC.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program, sponsored by [[Adidas]], offers professional-ready players in the U.S. developmental system not yet eligible for the [[MLS SuperDraft]] early entry, allowing MLS to compete with foreign professional clubs without comparable restrictions on player signing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ussoccerplayers.com/2010/01/mccabe-explains-generation-adidas.html|title=McCabe Explains Generation adidas|author=|date=|website=US Soccer Players}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its establishment in 1997 to 2005, the program was sponsored by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and was called '''Project-40'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/resource_center/soccer_history/447766.html|title=US Soccer Players|author=|date=|website=www.ussoccerplayers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally intended to improve the U.S. national team player pool, American national team eligibility is no longer required for program entry.

[[Carlos Parra]] was the first Project-40 player when he signed with the league and was allocated to the [[New York Red Bulls|New York/New Jersey MetroStars]] in 1997. Since then, the program has included players such as [[Tim Howard]], [[DaMarcus Beasley]], [[Maurice Edu]], [[Carlos Bocanegra]], [[Clint Dempsey]], [[Jozy Altidore]], [[Ben Olsen]], [[Sacha Kljestan]], [[Freddy Adu]], [[Brad Guzan]], [[Michael Bradley (soccer)|Michael Bradley]], [[Nick Rimando]], and [[Kyle Beckerman]]. 

Generation Adidas players do not count against the MLS senior roster and usually earn a much higher salary than the league minimum. Entering into the program automatically classifies a player as [[professional]], and thus disqualifies them from playing college soccer. As a result, Generation Adidas players are also guaranteed scholarships to continue their college education should their professional career not pan out.

From 1998 to 2000, MLS entered a team of Project-40 players, supplemented by other MLS players who did not get much playing time, into the [[USL First Division|A-League]] in the [[United Soccer Leagues|USL]].

In 2017, MLS introduced Canadian Generation Adidas players, part of a new initiative with the [[Canadian Soccer Association]]. Canadian Generation Adidas players count as domestic players on US based MLS teams.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/01/04/mls-announces-2017-generation-adidas-class-and-senior-signings&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Good Copy Bad Copy''''' (subtitled "A documentary about the current state of copyright and culture") is a 2007 [[documentary film]] about [[copyright]] and [[culture]] in the context of [[Internet]], [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]] and other technological advances, directed by Andreas Johnsen, Ralf Christensen, and [[Henrik Moltke]]. It features interviews with many people with various perspectives on [[copyright]], including copyright lawyers, producers, artists and filesharing service providers.

A central point of the documentary is the thesis that "creativity itself is on the line" and that a balance needs to be struck, or that there is a conflict between protecting the right of those who own intellectual property and the rights of future generations to create.

==Content==
Artists interviewed include [[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]] and [[Danger Mouse (Artist and Producer)|Danger Mouse]], popular musicians of the [[mashup (music)|mashup]] scene who cut and remix sounds from other songs into their own. The interviews with these artists reveal an emerging understanding of digital works and the obstacle to their authoring [[copyright]] presents.

The interviews featured in ''Good Copy Bad Copy'' acknowledge a recent shift towards [[user-generated content]], [[Mashup (music)|mashup]] music and video culture. The documentary opens with explaining the current legal situation concerning [[Sampling (music)|sampling]], [[licensing]] and [[copyright]].

''Good Copy Bad Copy'' documents the conflict between current [[copyright]] law and recent technological advances that enable the [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] of music, as well as the distribution of copyrighted material via [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]] search engines such as [[The Pirate Bay]]. MPAA ([[Motion Picture Association of America]]) CEO [[Dan Glickman]] is interviewed in connection with a raid by the [[Swedish police]] against The Pirate Bay in May 2006. Glickman concedes that piracy will never be stopped, but states that they will try to make it as difficult and tedious as possible. [[Gottfrid Svartholm]] and [[Fredrik Neij]] from The Pirate Bay are also interviewed, with Neij stating that The Pirate Bay is illegal according to US law, but not Swedish law.

The interviews document attitudes towards [[art]], culture and copyright in a number of countries, including the [[United States]], [[Sweden]], [[Russia]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Brazil]].

The situation in [[Nigeria]] and [[Brazil]] is documented in terms of innovative business models that have developed in response to new technological possibilities and changing markets.

In [[Nigeria]] the documentary interviews individuals working within the Nigerian [[film]] industry, or [[Nollywood]]. [[Charles Igwe]], a film producer in Lagos, is interviewed at length about his views on the Nigerian film industry, the nature of Nigerian films, and copyright in the context of [[digital video]] technology. Mayo Ayilaran, from the [[Copyright Society of Nigeria]], explains the Nigerian government's approach to copyright enforcement.

In [[Brazil]] the [[Tecno brega]] industry and its unique approach to [[copyright]] and [[sampling (music)|sampling]] is documented, featuring interviews with amongst others [[Ronaldo Lemos]], Professor of Law [[Fundação Getúlio Vargas|FGV]] Brazil. Lemos explains that CDs or recorded music is treated merely as an advertisement for parties and concerts that generate revenue.

''Good Copy Bad Copy'' also includes interview segments with copyright activist and academic [[Lawrence Lessig]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodcopybadcopy.net/about Good Copy Bad Copy—About]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodcopybadcopy.net/credits Good Copy Bad Copy—Credits]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Gun laws by country}}
'''Gun laws in [[Italy]]''' incorporates the political and regulatory aspects of [[firearm]]s usage in the country within the framework of the [[European Firearms Directive]].&lt;ref group="nb" name="policy" /&gt; Different types of gun licenses can be obtained from the national police authorities. According to a 2007 study by [http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/ The Small Arms Survey Project], the [[per capita]] gun ownership rate in Italy is around 12% with an estimated 7 million registered firearms in circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Small Arms Survey 2007: Guns and the City - Chapter 2:Completing the Count: Civilian Firearms |url=http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/files/sas/publications/yearb2007.html|publisher=Small Arms Survey|accessdate=24 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guns per 100 residents|url=http://www.edutube.org/interactive/guns-100-residents|publisher=EduTube.org|accessdate=24 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carry licenses==

To legally purchase firearms in Italy, one must either obtain a "purchase authorization" (''nulla osta'' all'acquisto),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Autorizzazione all'acquisto di armi e munizioni |url=http://www.poliziadistato.it/articolo/305/|work=poliziadistato.it|accessdate=22 September 2014|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows the holder to purchase and own a firearm but not carry or use it, or be issued with a carry license first. A firearm purchase authorization is mostly used today to inherit a deceased close relative's firearms. To obtain either license applicants must be 18 or older, prove they can handle and use a firearm safely (usually by obtaining a certificate from a shooting range after attending a practical shooting course), declare to have a clean criminal record (verification will be made by the Police authorities) and must not be mentally ill or be a known abuser of, or addicted to, alcohol or illegal drugs. Other grounds for refusal of a carry license include being a [[conscientious objector]] or living with persons who may gain access to the firearms and abuse them  (e.g. living with family members who are mentally ill, alcoholic or drug addicts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sintesi del diritto delle armi (A brief essay on gun law) |url=http://www.earmi.it/diritto/faq/sintesi.htm|publisher=www.earmi.it|accessdate=24 July 2010|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gun and Firearms Laws, Justice, Culture and Crime in Foreign Countries|url=http://www.gunslot.com/articles/gun-and-firearms-laws-justice-culture-and-crime-foreign-countries|accessdate=24 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dave Kopel &amp; Carlo Stagnaro|title=Gianni, Get Your Gun|url=http://www.davekopel.com/2a/Mags/Italy.htm|accessdate=24 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Firearms Catalogue==
Italian laws prescribed that any rifled-barreled firearm imported or manufactured in Italy after 1976 should have been identified by a progressive catalogue number, assigned by a commission composed of government officials and representatives from the Italian arms industries. The role of the commission was to decide if a rifled firearm should be classified either a ''war firearm'' (''arma da guerra'') or a ''common firearm'' (''arma comune da sparo''). The national firearms catalogue described the characteristics of the weapon (barrel and overall length, number of rounds in the magazine and other technical specifications) that cannot legally be altered without resubmitting the weapon to the commission. ''Common firearms'' with certain features (sights, type of [[Firearm action|action]]) can be classified as ''sporting firearms'' (''armi sportive''), which can be used for [[self defence]] as an ''extrema ratio'' (es. during a home invasion) but which can not be [[Concealed carry|carried for said purpose]].

The said catalogue and the related commission has been abolished since 2012, due to the economic stability law, approved 12 November 2011; its place has been taken by the Banco Nazionale di Prova (National Proof House) in [[Gardone Val Trompia]], which admits or rejects firearms pending importation, at the same time maintaining an electronic record of the characteristics (long or short firearm, European firearm category, manufacturer, magazine capacity, etc.) of the firearms permitted for sale.

==Firearms and ammunition possession==
All private firearms must be registered at the local police department within "72 hours", as specified by law, after purchase or transfer, although this limit goes from the time the firearm is actually taken to the place where it is to be registered (for example, the firearm may be bought at a time and withdrawn after a week from the retailer; only then the weapon will require the registration).

Citizens are allowed to own:
* up to three ''common firearms'' (usually [[handgun]]s, but all firearms not using hunting calibers fall into this category, such as 10-gauge shotguns, or some .22 rimfire pistols and rifles);
* up to twelve weapons that have been classified as manufactured for [[shooting sports]] by the National Proof House;
* an unlimited number of [[hunting weapons]] (both rifles and shotguns);
* up to eight antique or historical weapons (manufactured before 1890);
* unlimited numbers of single shot muzzle loader replicas, for which no registration is needed;
* unlimited numbers of airguns under 7.5 Joules of muzzle energy, specifically approved by the Ministry of Interior, which require no registration as well.

Ammunition is also regulated. While each licensed individual can keep 1500 rounds of hunting ammunition, only 200 rounds of handgun ammunition are allowed. A license to store additional 1500 rounds of pistol ammunition can be obtained, provided specific requirements are met. Ammunition purchases must also be registered.

Trade and ownership of deactivated and replica (non firing) firearms is unrestricted, although every deactivated firearm must be accompanied by a deactivation certificate in conformity to the Italian law.

===Firearm collector's license===
A ''Firearm Collector's License'' allows the bearer to keep at home an unlimited number of weapons, but they usually cannot be used or moved, their ammunition cannot be bought and, if the number of owned weapons is high, the owner may be requested to keep them in a safe room; exact details may vary according to the local police department's policy. Holders of a Special Firearm Collectors License can own a higher number of weapons but are forbidden from using or moving them and from buying ammunition. In certain cases, they are required to house the weapons in a safe room that meets police specifications.

==Carry guns in public places==
In Italy it is illegal to carry weapons in public places, but the law provides the following exceptions:

===Hunting license===
A [[hunting license]], along with a special hunting permit issued by the [[Regions of Italy|region]] of residence, allows to carry hunting weapons only during the hunting season and only within game preserves. When transporting them outside game reserves, the shotguns must be kept unloaded and locked in their case.

Firearms allowed for hunt are:

* All smooth bore guns, with a gauge not bigger than 12, overall length more than 60&amp;nbsp;cm and a barrel length more than 30&amp;nbsp;cm.
* Rifled bore guns, firing a bullet with a diameter more than 5.6mm or a case longer than 40mm, overall length more than 60&amp;nbsp;cm and a barrel length more than 30&amp;nbsp;cm.

===Shooting sports license===
With a ''shooting sports license'', citizens are allowed to transport (unloaded and stored in a proper case) firearms from their home to an authorized shooting range or to another safe place to practice shooting, which, in case of a private place, must be reasonably distant from roads and inhabited areas, and not accessible by unauthorized people. Just like any other gun license, the shooting sports license is valid nationwide: the shooter can thus transport his/her gun anywhere through the national territory, although said guns can only be ''used'' in the aforementioned designated places and must never be left unattended during transportation.

===Concealed carry license===
A ''concealed carry license'' allows a citizen to carry a handgun for personal defense; this license is usually much harder to obtain than the other two firearm licenses, must be renewed yearly (while the hunting and shooting sports licences are valid for 6 years), and the applicant has to provide a valid reason to carry a concealed gun (e.g. a salesperson of valuable goods such as jewelry). A special carry license is released to [[security guard|private security personnel]]; this license differs from the standard carry licenses in that it has to be renewed every two years and a lower tax to pay for the release. Open-carry of handguns is not explicitly forbidden by the law, but it is ''de facto'' permitted only to on-duty security personnel.
The prefects, magistrates can buy and carry guns for self-defense without Concealed Carry License.

==Limitations==
Italian gun laws pose restrictions to the kind of firearms, calibers and magazine available to civilians. [[Semi-automatic rifle|Semi-automatic firearms]] can be bought by licensees without additional restrictions.
FORBIDDEN: Noise Suppressor as well as Semiautomatic pistols in [[9mm Parabellum]] are restricted for the civil market. Full-automatic/select-fire firearms (machineguns), grenade launchers, suppressors, destructive devices and all other kinds of military weapons and ammunition, semiautomatic pistols in caliber
REGULATED CALIBER: [[9mm Parabellum]] is permitted for revolver and rifle only; [[5.56×45mm NATO]] is forbidden but .223 Rem is permitted; [[7.62×51mm NATO]] is forbidden but 308 WIN is permitted).
REGULATED ACCESSORIES: magazine with capacity greater of 20 rounds for pistols or 10 for rifle are not traced but need to be denounced as weapons within 72 hours from the purchase as per article 38 of the amended Public Security Act (TULPS)&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Testo unico delle leggi di pubblica sicurezza]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=July 2018}}.

==Police forces==
[[Law enforcement in Italy#National Police Forces|National police]] officers are always allowed to carry their handguns without territorial or time restrictions, but are required to carry them concealed when they are off duty. Submachine guns can only be carried while on duty.

[[Law enforcement in Italy#Local police forces|Local police]] officers are generally allowed to carry their handguns (concealed when off duty), but only within their territorial limits.

Security guards can be allowed by the prefect to carry weapons when on duty and without territorial limits, upon request; usually this permission is granted to cash-in-transit security officers, as well as to private security personnel guarding banks, shopping malls and other facilities (in recent years, even some public offices and hospitals in Italy have contracted private security personnel for 24/7 protection).

The guns carried by police forces are usually the property of the national or local government authority from which they depend; National Police officers are usually assigned a pistol for an indefinite time, while gun assignment specifications for Local Police forces may vary from indefinite to limited, according to local regulations.

==Notes==
{{Reflist|group=nb|refs=
&lt;ref group="nb" name="policy" &gt;The [[English language|English]] words 'politics' and 'policy' are both translated by the single [[Italian language|Italian]] word '[[:it:Politica|politica]]': discussion of this topic with an Italian speaker should recognize that for the Italian there is no automatic distinction between 'politics' and 'policy'.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Composition ==
US patent 4,444,925 lists the components of Gyp-Crete® as atmospheric [[calcination|calcined]] [[gypsum]], sand, water, and small amounts of various additives. Additives listed include [[polyvinyl alcohol]], an extender such as [[sodium citrate]] or [[fly ash]], a [[surfactant]] such as Colloid defoamer 1513 DD made by Colloids, Inc., and a fluidizer based on sodium or potassium derivatives of [[naphthalene]] [[sulfonate]] [[formaldehyde]] condensate. One example mix is shown below.&lt;ref name="US4444925"&gt;Feldman, J. G. (1984) ''[http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=04444925&amp;PageNum=1&amp;IDKey=9F1DEF06CE85&amp;HomeUrl=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526d=PALL%2526p=1%2526u=%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r=1%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526s1=4444925.PN.%2526OS=PN/4444925%2526RS=PN/4444925 U.S. Patent No. 4,444,925]''.

The purpose of the polyvinyl alcohol is to prevent the surface of the concrete from becoming dusty. While the exact mechanism is not known, it is thought that as the concrete sets, water migrates to the surface, bringing with it fine, dusty particles. When the water evaporates, the dusty particles are deposited on the surface. It is thought that the polyvinyl alcohol prevents the dusty particles from migrating upwards with the water.&lt;ref name="US4444925" /&gt;

The mix is prepared on site using a specialized truck. The truck contains a tank for water, a mixing tank, a holding tank, a pump, and a conveyor for the sand and calcined gypsum. A hopper for the sand and gypsum is mounted externally on the vehicle.&lt;ref name="US4075374"&gt;Jorgenson, C. R., et al. (1978) ''[http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=04075374&amp;PageNum=1&amp;&amp;IDKey=AB2ED0EA28BB&amp;HomeUrl=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526d=PALL%2526p=1%2526u=%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r=1%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526s1=4075374.PN.%2526OS=PN/4075374%2526RS=PN/4075374 U.S. Patent No. 4,075,374]''. Washington, DC: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.&lt;/ref&gt;

To prepare the mix, the sand and calcined gypsum are added to the hopper and mixed. Most of the required water is added to the mixing tank, then the sand and calcined gypsum are mixed in. Once all the sand and calcined gypsum have been mixed in, the rest of the water is added until the proper consistency is attained. Finally, the additives are mixed in and the whole batch of concrete is moved to the holding tank to be pumped out into the required area via long hoses. A small sample is taken from the batch and set aside so that the set-up time can be observed and adjustments can be made to the amount of additives so that the timing is correct.

Once the mix has been poured, little leveling, if any, is needed. The mix should be smoothed gently with a flat board, such as a 40” 1x4. This helps to concentrate the calcined gypsum at the surface.&lt;ref name="US4075374" /&gt;

=== Previous formulations ===
US patent 4,075,374 lists the formulation as 10 parts pressure calcined gypsum, 38-48 parts sand, and 4-10 parts water. 0.03 to 0.1 parts of a latex emulsion, such as Dow Latex 460, were also added. To prevent foaming, a [[defoamer]] such as WEX was added to the latex at a concentration of 0.2%. It was stated that gypsum calcined at atmospheric pressure produced poor results due to it having flaky particles, and that gypsum calcined under a pressure of 15-17 psi produced better results because it had denser, crystalline particles.&lt;ref name="US4075374" /&gt;

Later it was found that this original formulation expanded too much and in some instances floors cracked. US patent 4,159,912 describes changes made so that the expansion was greatly reduced. In that formulation, 5-8% of [[Portland cement]] was added to reduce the expansion. The latex emulsion and antifoaming agent were no longer necessary as the concrete was strengthened by the Portland cement. It was found that atmospheric calcined gypsum could be used for the majority of the calcined gypsum if it was [[ball mill]]ed to change the texture. The proportion of sand was also changed, so that it was in a 1:1.3 to 1:3 ratio with the calcined gypsum. This resulted in a runnier mix, but the set up time was not changed.&lt;ref name="US4159912"&gt;Jorgenson, R. M. (1979). ''[http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=04159912&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;homeurl=http%3A%252F%252Fpatft.uspto.gov%252Fnetahtml%252FPTO%252Fpatimg.htm U.S. Patent No. 4,159,912]''. Washington, DC: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Gypsum concrete is lightweight and fire-resistant. A 1.5-inch slab of gypsum concrete weighs 13 pounds per square foot versus 18 pounds per square foot for regular concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silberstein|first=Eugene|title=Residential construction academy: HVAC|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2004|series=Residential Construction Academy Series|page=467|isbn=978-1-4018-4901-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZW8mg892yfEC&amp;pg=PA467|accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Even though gypsum concrete weighs less, it still has the same compressive strength as regular concrete, based on its application as underlayment or top coat flooring.&lt;ref name="Ceilley Insulation"&gt;{{cite web|title=gypsum concrete|url=http://www.insulation.net/the_products_and_services/gypsum_concrete.php|publisher=Kinzler Construction Services|accessdate=8 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916181340/http://insulation.net/the_products_and_services/gypsum_concrete.php|archivedate=16 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A 7-man work crew can lay 4–6 times as much gypsum concrete in a work day as regular poured Portland cement. This is due to the ease of leveling the very runny gypsum concrete versus normal concrete.  In addition, if the wooden subfloor is first coated in a film of latex, the adhesion between the subfloor and the concrete is much better than the adhesion obtained with “normal” concrete. A further benefit is that nails can be driven through the cement into the subfloor without it chipping.&lt;ref name="US4075374" /&gt;
The cost of gypsum concrete is comparable to regular concrete, ranging from $1.75 per square foot to $6.00 per square foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warmboard.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/Warmboard-S_vs_GypsumConcrete.pdf|title=Archived copy|access-date=2013-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213114344/http://www.warmboard.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/Warmboard-S_vs_GypsumConcrete.pdf#|archive-date=2013-12-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Regular concrete ranges from $2.50 to $4.50 per square foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concretenetwork.com/concrete-prices.html|title=Concrete Prices - How Much Does Concrete Cost? - The Concrete Network|website=www.concretenetwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the late 1940s, copper tubing and Portland concrete were used to install radiant heat flooring.  The copper tubes would be laid out around the ground and then the Portland concrete could be poured to cover the tubing and make an even base for the floor.  However, this practice fell out of use in the United States within 15–20 years because the Portland concrete was too corrosive on the copper tubing.  In the 1980s Gypsum concrete became widely used in the United States for radiant heat flooring.  Plastic [[PEX]] tubing could be used with Gypsum concrete for radiant heat flooring without concern for corrosion on the PEX tubing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gypsum-newyork.com/poured_floors_007.htm|title=History of Radiant Heat and Gypsum Concrete|website=www.gypsum-newyork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==
1. {{note|a}} The table in the patent lists the PVA content as 0.45 grains (0.00002%). Later on, it is stated that the PVA should be in a 1:0.005625 ratio with the calcined gypsum. This yields a PVA content of 0.45&amp;nbsp;lbs (0.16%).

'''Incontrovertible evidence''' is a colloquial term for [[evidence (law)|evidence]] introduced to prove a fact that is supposed to be so conclusive that there can be no other truth to the matter; evidence so strong it overpowers contrary evidence, directing a fact-finder to a specific and certain conclusion.

Examples: a [[DNA test]] disproving a claim of parenthood.

'''Insurance fraud''' is any act committed to [[fraud|defraud]] an insurance process. This occurs when a claimant attempts to obtain some benefit or advantage they are not entitled to, or when an insurer knowingly denies some benefit that is due.  According to the United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the most common schemes include: premium diversion, fee churning, asset diversion, and workers compensation fraud. Perpetrators in these schemes can be insurance company employees or claimants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/insurance-fraud |title=FBI — Insurance Fraud |publisher=Fbi.gov |date=2005-09-08 |accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''False insurance claims''' are [[insurance]] claims filed with the intent to [[fraud|defraud]] an insurance provider.

Insurance fraud has existed since the beginning of insurance as a commercial enterprise.&lt;ref name="manes34"&gt;[[#Reference-idManes1945|Manes, Alfred. "Insurance Crimes."]] p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Fraudulent claims account for a significant portion of all claims received by insurers, and cost billions of dollars annually.  Types of insurance fraud are diverse, and occur in all areas of insurance.  Insurance crimes also range in severity, from slightly exaggerating claims to deliberately causing accidents or damage.  Fraudulent activities affect the lives of innocent people, both directly through accidental or intentional injury or damage, and indirectly as these crimes lead to higher insurance premiums.  Insurance fraud poses a significant problem, and governments and other organizations try to deter such activity.

An [[epigram]] by the Roman poet [[Martial]] provides a clear evidence the phenomenon of insurance fraud was already known in the Roman Empire during the First Century AD &lt;ref&gt;Jo-Ann Shelton, ''As the Romans Did: A Sourcebook in Roman Social History'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988), 65.&lt;/ref&gt;:  

: "Tongilianus, you paid two hundred for your house;
: An accident too common in this city destroyed it.
: You collected ten times more. Doesn't it seem, I pray,
: That you set fire to your own house, Tongilianus?"&lt;br&gt; [[wikisource:la:Epigrammaton liber III#LII|''Book III, No. 52'']]

==Causes==

The “chief motive in all insurance crimes is financial profit.”&lt;ref name="manes34"/&gt; Insurance contracts provide both the insured and the insurer with opportunities for exploitation.

According to the [[Coalition Against Insurance Fraud]], the causes vary, but are usually centered on greed, and on holes in the protections against fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Fraud Persists |url= http://www.insurancefraud.org/why_fraud_persists.htm |work=Coalition Against Insurance Fraud |publisher=Insurancefraud.org |date=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, those who commit insurance fraud view it as a low-risk, lucrative enterprise. For example, drug dealers who have entered insurance fraud &lt;ref&gt;Kendall, Marisa. Southwest Florida gangs eschew street for Internet, [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/news_press/access/2562148221.html?FMT=ABS&amp;date=Jan+17%2C+2012] The News Press - Fort Myers, Fla. January 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; think it’s safer and more profitable than working street corners. Compared to those for other crimes, court sentences for insurance fraud can be lenient, reducing the risk of extended punishment. Though insurers fight fraud, some pay suspicious claims anyway, as settling such claims is often cheaper than legal action.

Another basis for fraud is over-insurance, in which someone insures property for more than its real value.&lt;ref name="manes34"/&gt; This condition can be difficult to avoid, especially since an insurance provider might sometimes encourage it to obtain greater profits.&lt;ref name="manes34"/&gt; This lets fraudsters profit by destroying their property, because they receive an insurance payout greater that the value property.  The most common forms of insurance fraud are re-framing a non-insured damage to make it an event covered by insurance, and inflating the value of the loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genre.com/knowledge/publications/rmrv16-1-burbach-en.html|title=Soft Fraud and Possibilities for Prevention {{!}} Gen Re|website=Gen Re Perspective|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insurance companies are also susceptible to fraud because it's possible for fraudsters to file claims for damages that never occurred.

==Losses due to insurance fraud==

It is hard to place an exact value on the money stolen through insurance fraud. Insurance fraud is deliberately undetectable, unlike visible crimes such as robbery or murder. As such, the number of cases of insurance fraud that are detected is much lower than the number of acts that are actually committed.&lt;ref name="manes34"/&gt;  The best that can be done is to provide an estimate for the losses that insurers suffer due to insurance fraud.  The [[Coalition Against Insurance Fraud]] estimates that in 2006 a total of about $80 billion was lost in the [[United States]] due to insurance fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idCoalitionAnnual|Coalition Against Insurance Fraud. Annual Report.]]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to estimates by the [[Insurance Information Institute]], insurance fraud accounts for about 10 percent of the property/casualty insurance industry’s incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idIIIInsuranceFraud|Insurance Information Institute. "Insurance Fraud."]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association estimates that 3% of the health care industry’s expenditures in the United States are due to fraudulent activities, amounting to a cost of about $51 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idNHCAA|National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association. "The Problem of Health Care Fraud."]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other estimates attribute as much as 10% of the total healthcare spending in the United States to fraud—about $115 billion annually.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHyman2001|Hyman, David A. "Health Care Fraud and Abuse."]] p. 532.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study of all types of fraud committed in the United States insurance institutions (property-and-casualty, business liability, healthcare, social security, etc.)put the true cost at 33% to 38% of the total cash flow through the system. This study resulted in the book title "The Trillion Dollar Insurance Crook" by J.E. Smith. In the [[United Kingdom]], the Insurance Fraud Bureau estimates that the loss due to insurance fraud in the [[United Kingdom]] is about [[Pound sterling|£]]1.5 billion ($3.08 billion), causing a 5% increase in insurance premiums.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idIFB|Insurance Fraud Bureau. "Fighting Organized Insurance Fraud."]] p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Insurance Bureau of Canada]] estimates that personal injury fraud in [[Canada]] costs about [[Canadian dollar|C$]]500 million annually.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idIBC|Insurance Bureau of Canada. "Cost of Personal Injury Fraud."]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Indiaforensic Center of Studies estimates that Insurance frauds in [[India]] costs about [[US dollar|$]]6.25 billion annually.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Indiaforensic Center of Studies|"Indiaforensic Study on quantification of fraud losses to Indian Insurance Sector "]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hard vs. soft fraud==

Insurance fraud can be classified as either hard fraud or soft fraud.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[[#Reference-idIIIFraud|Insurance Information Institute. "Fraud."]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hard fraud''' occurs when someone deliberately plans or invents a loss, such as a collision, auto theft, or fire that is covered by their insurance policy so they can claim payment for damages. Criminal rings are sometimes involved in hard fraud schemes that can steal millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idCoalitionLearn|Coalition Against Insurance Fraud. "Learn About Fraud."]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soft fraud''', which is far more common than hard fraud, is sometimes also referred to as opportunistic fraud.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  This type of fraud consists of policyholders exaggerating otherwise-legitimate claims.  For example, when involved in an automotive collision an insured person might claim more damage than actually occurred. Soft fraud can also occur when, while obtaining a new health [[insurance policy]], an individual misreports previous or existing conditions to obtain a lower premium on the insurance policy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Types of insurance fraud==

===Life insurance===
{{see also|Category:Murderers for life insurance money}}
Life insurance fraud may involve [[faked death|faking death]] to claim life insurance. Fraudsters may sometimes turn up a few years after disappearing, claiming a loss of memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Summers|first=Chris|title=Couple face 'fake drowning' trial|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3734274.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 November 2004|date=17 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of life insurance fraud is the [[John Darwin disappearance case]], which was an investigation into the act of [[pseudocide]] committed by the British former teacher and prison officer John Darwin, who turned up alive in December 2007, five years after he was thought to have died in a canoeing accident. Darwin was reported as "missing" after failing to report to work following a canoeing trip on March 21, 2002. He reappeared on December 1, 2007, claiming to have no memory of the past five years.

Another example is former British Government minister [[John Stonehouse#Faking his own death|John Stonehouse]] who went missing in 1974 from a beach in Miami. He was discovered living under an assumed name in [[Australia]], extradited to Britain and jailed for seven years for fraud, theft and forgery.

===Health care insurance===
{{see also|Medicare fraud|Health care fraud}}

Health insurance fraud is described as an intentional act of deceiving, concealing, or misrepresenting information that results in health care benefits being paid to an individual or group.

Fraud can be committed either by an insured person or by a provider. Member fraud consists of claims on behalf of ineligible members and/or dependents, alterations on enrollment forms, concealing pre-existing conditions, failure to report other coverage, [[prescription drug]] fraud, and failure to disclose claims that were a result of a work-related injury.

Provider fraud consists of claims submitted by bogus physicians, billing for services not rendered, billing for higher level of services, [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] or treatments that are outside the scope of practice, alterations on claims submissions, and providing services while medical licenses are either suspended or revoked. [[Independent medical examination]]s debunk false insurance claims and allow the insurance company or claimant to seek a non-partial medical view for injury-related cases.

According to the [[Coalition Against Insurance Fraud]], health insurance fraud depletes taxpayer-funded programs like Medicare, and may victimize patients in the hands of certain doctors.&lt;ref&gt;Quiggle, James. [http://insurancefraud.org/health_scams.htm] "Health Fraud" Scam Alerts. Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scams involve double-billing by doctors who charge insurers for treatments that never occurred, and surgeons who perform unnecessary surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.fbi.gov/baltimore/press-releases/2011/salisbury-cardiologist-convicted-of-implanting-unnecessary-cardiac-stents | work=FBI | last=U.S. Attorney's Office | title=Salisbury Cardiologist Convicted of Implanting Unnecessary Cardiac Stents | date=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Roger Feldman, Blue Cross Professor of Health Insurance at the [[University of Minnesota]], one of the main reasons that medical fraud is such a prevalent practice is that nearly all of the parties involved find it favorable in some way.  Many [[physician]]s see it as necessary to provide quality care for their patients.  Many patients, although disapproving of the idea of fraud, are sometimes more willing to accept it when it affects their own medical care.  Program administrators are often lenient on the issue of insurance fraud, as they want to maximize the services of their providers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idFeldman2001|Feldman, Roger. "Economic Explanation."]] p. 569-570.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common perpetrators of healthcare insurance fraud are [[health care provider]]s.  One reason for this, according to David Hyman, a Professor at the [[University of Maryland School of Law]], is that the historically-prevailing attitude in the medical profession is one of “fidelity to patients”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHyman2001|Hyman, David A. "Health Care Fraud and Abuse."]] p. 541.&lt;/ref&gt;  This incentive can lead to fraudulent practices such as billing insurers for treatments that are not covered by the patient’s insurance policy.  To do this, physicians bill for a different service that the policy covers, rather than the service they rendered.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHyman2001|Hyman, David A. "Health Care Fraud and Abuse."]] p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another motivation for insurance fraud is a desire for financial gain.  Public healthcare programs such as [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] are especially conducive to fraudulent activities, as they are often run on a [[fee-for-service]] structure.&lt;ref name="pontell118"&gt;[[#Reference-idPontell1982|Pontell, Henry N., et al. "Policing Physicians."]] p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Physicians use several fraudulent techniques to achieve this end.  These can include “up-coding” or “upgrading,” which involve billing for more expensive treatments than those actually provided; providing, and subsequently billing for, treatments that are not medically necessary; scheduling extra visits for patients; referring patients to other physicians when no further treatment is actually necessary; "phantom billing," or billing for services not rendered; and “ganging,” or billing for services to family members or other individuals who are accompanying the patient but who did not personally receive any services.&lt;ref name="pontell118"/&gt;

Perhaps the greatest total dollar amount of fraud is committed by the health insurance companies themselves. There are numerous studies and articles detailing examples of insurance companies intentionally not paying claims and deleting them from their systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/02/nyregion/metro-business-new-york-state-fines-insurer-500000.html | work=The New York Times | first=Joseph P. | last=Fried | title=Metro Business; New York State Fines Insurer $500,000 | date=2000-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; denying and cancelling coverage, and the blatant underpayment to hospitals and physicians beneath what are normal fees for care they provide.&lt;ref name="hcfan.3cdn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hcfan.3cdn.net/d489f04dd6172aae34_4sm6iijoh.pdf |title=hcfan.3cdn.net |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although difficult to obtain the information, this fraud by insurance companies can be estimated by comparing revenues from premium payments and expenditures on health claims.

In response to the increased amount of health care fraud in the United States, [[United States Congress|Congress]], through the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] of 1996 (HIPAA), has specifically established health care fraud as a federal [[criminal offense]] with punishment of up to ten years of prison in addition to significant financial penalties.

===Automobile insurance===

Fraud rings or groups may fake traffic deaths or stage collisions to make false insurance or exaggerated claims and collect insurance money. The ring may involve insurance claims adjusters and other people who create phony police reports to process claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Diego Fraud Ring Cracked|url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2002/12/20/250705849$035.htm|publisher=Insurance Journal|accessdate=24 April 2006|date=20 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Insurance Fraud Bureau]] in the UK estimated there were more than 20,000 staged collisions and false insurance claims across the UK from 1999 to 2006. One tactic fraudsters use is to drive to a busy junction or roundabout and brake sharply causing a motorist to drive into the back of them. They claim the other motorist was at fault because they were driving too fast or too close behind them, and make a false and inflated claim to the motorist's insurer for whiplash and damage, which can pay the fraudsters up to £30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Howard|first=Bob|title=Fraud body warns of crash scams|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/moneybox/6186027.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 December 2007|date=16 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Insurance Fraud Bureau's first year or operation, the usage of [[data mining]] initiatives exposed insurance fraud networks and led to 74 arrests and a five-to-one return on investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grant|first=Ian|title=Insurance Fraud Bureau's data-mining initiatives net fraudsters|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240082446/Insurance-Fraud-Bureaus-data-mining-initiatives-net-fraudsters|publisher=[[Computer Weekly]]|accessdate=2 December 2007|date=9 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Insurance Research Council]] estimated that in 1996, 21 to 36 percent of auto-insurance claims contained elements of suspected fraud.&lt;ref name="tennyson289"&gt;[[#Reference-idTennyson2002|Tennyson, Sharon et al. "Claims Auditing"]] p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a wide variety of schemes used to defraud automobile insurance providers.  These ploys can differ greatly in complexity and severity. [[Richard A. Derrig]], vice president of research for the [[Insurance Fraud Bureau of Massachusetts]], lists several ways that auto-insurance fraud can occur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derrig.com/research/InsuranceFraud.pdf|accessdate=8 August 2013|title=Insurance Fraud}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as:

====Staged collisions====

In staged collision fraud, fraudsters use a motor vehicle to stage an accident with the innocent party.  Typically, the fraudsters' vehicle carries four or five passengers.  Its driver makes an unexpected manoeuvre, forcing an innocent party to collide with the fraudster's vehicle. Each of the fraudsters then files claims for injuries sustained in the vehicle.  A “recruited” doctor diagnoses whiplash or other soft-tissue injuries that are hard to dispute later.

Other examples include jumping in front of cars as done in Russia. The driving conditions and roads are dangerous with many people trying to scam drivers by jumping in front of expensive-looking cars or crashing into them. Hit and runs are very common and insurance companies notoriously specialize in denying claims. Two-way insurance coverage is very expensive and almost completely unavailable for vehicles over ten years old–the drivers can only obtain basic liability. Because Russian courts do not like using verbal claims, most people have dashboard cameras installed to warn would-be perpetrators or provide evidence for/against claims.&lt;ref name="jalopnik russian scams"&gt;{{cite web|last=Galperina|first=Marina|title=Why Russians Are Obsessed With Dash-Cams|url=http://jalopnik.com/5918159/why-russians-are-obsessed-with-dash+cams|publisher=[[Jalopnik]]|accessdate=19 November 2012|date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exaggerated claims====

A real accident may occur, but the dishonest owner may take the opportunity to incorporate a whole range of previous minor damage to the vehicle into the garage bill associated with the real accident. Personal injuries may also be exaggerated, particularly [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Press Association |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/dec/11/government-plans-cut-whiplash-claims |title=Government plans to cut whiplash injury claims &amp;#124; Money &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2012-12-11 |accessdate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insurance fraud cases of exaggerated claims can also include claiming damage to the car that is not from the accident reported in the claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of insurance fraud|url=https://www.cityoflondon.police.uk/advice-and-support/fraud-and-economic-crime/ifed/Pages/Types-of-insurance-fraud.aspx|website=City of London Police|accessdate=18 July 2017|date=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===

Examples of [[soft auto-insurance fraud]] include filing more than one claim for a single injury, filing claims for injuries not related to an [[automobile accident]], misreporting wage losses due to injuries, and reporting higher costs for [[car repair]]s than those that were actually paid. [[Hard auto-insurance fraud]] can include activities such as staging automobile collisions, filing claims when the claimant was not actually involved in the accident, submitting claims for medical treatments that were not received, or inventing injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idDerrig2002|Derrig, Richard A. "Insurance Fraud."]] p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hard fraud]] can also occur when claimants falsely report their vehicle as stolen.  [[Soft fraud]] accounts for the majority of fraudulent auto-insurance claims.&lt;ref name="tennyson289"/&gt;

Another example is that a person may illegally register their car to a location that would net them cheaper insurance rates than where they actually live, sometimes called ''rate evasion''. For example, some drivers in [[Brooklyn]] have [[Vehicle registration plates of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania license plates]], because insurance rates for a car registered to an address in rural [[Pennsylvania]] are much less than they are in Brooklyn. Another form of [[automobile insurance fraud]], known as "fronting," involves registering someone other than the real primary driver of a car as the primary driver of the car. For example, parents might list themselves as the primary driver of their children's vehicles to avoid young driver premiums.

"[[Crash for cash]]" scams may involve random unaware strangers, set to appear as the perpetrators of the orchestrated crashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11046344 |title=BBC News - Car crash scams at record level |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= 2010-08-21|accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such techniques are the ''classic rear-end shunt'' (the driver in front suddenly slams on the brakes, possibly with brake lights disabled), the ''decoy rear-end shunt'' (when following one car, another one pulls in front of it, causing it to brake sharply, then the first car drives off) or the ''helpful wave shunt'' (the driver is waved into a line of queuing traffic by the scammer who promptly crashes, then denies waving).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The One Show Team - September 15, 2008 3:50 PM |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theoneshow/consumer/2008/09/15/crashing-in-on-crime.html |title=Crash for cash - a scam for the unquestioning? - Consumer |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2008-09-15 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Organized crime]] rings can also be involved in auto-insurance fraud, sometimes carrying out schemes that are very complex. An example of one such ploy is given by [[Ken Dornstein]], author of ''[[Accidentally, on Purpose: The Making of a Personal Injury Underworld in America]]''. In this scheme, known as a “swoop-and-squat,” one or more drivers in “swoop” cars force an unsuspecting driver into position behind a “squat” car. This squat car, which is usually filled with several passengers, then slows abruptly, forcing the driver of the chosen car to collide with the squat car.  The passengers in the squat car then file a claim with the other driver’s insurance company.  This claim often includes bills for medical treatments that were not necessary or not received.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idDornstein1996|Dornstein, Ken. Accidentally on Purpose.]] p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

An incident that took place on [[Golden State Freeway]] June 17, 1992, brought public attention to the existence of organized crime rings that stage auto accidents for insurance fraud. These schemes generally consist of three different levels. At the top, there are the professionals—doctors or lawyers who diagnose false injuries and/or file fraudulent claims and these earn the bulk of the profits from the fraud. Next are the "[[capper (insurance fraud)]]s" or "runners", the middlemen who obtain the cars to crash, farm out the claims to the professionals at the top, and recruit participants. These participants at the bottom-rung of the scheme are desperate people (poor immigrants or others in need of quick cash) who are paid around $1000 USD to place their bodies in the paths of cars and trucks, playing a kind of Russian roulette with their lives and those of unsuspecting motorists around them. According to investigators, cappers usually hire within their own ethnic groups. What makes busting these [[staged-accident crime ring]]s difficult is how quickly they move into jurisdictions with lesser enforcement, after a crackdown in a particular region. As a result, in the US several levels of police and the [[insurance industry]] have cooperated in forming task forces and sharing databases to track claim histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherjones.com/politics/1993/09/swoop-and-squats# |title=motherjones.com |publisher=motherjones.com |date=1992-06-17 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/how-small-time-auto-insurance-scams-have-evolved-into-big-business-in-canada/article1850088/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | first1=Grant | last1=Robertson | first2=Tara | last2=Perkins | title=How small-time auto insurance scams have evolved into big business in Canada | date=2010-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], there is an increasing incidence of false [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]] claims to [[car insurance]] companies from [[motorist]]s involved in minor [[car accidents]] (for instance; a shunt). Because the mechanism of injury is not fully understood, [[Accident and Emergency|A&amp;E]] doctors have to rely on a [[patient|patient's]] external symptoms (which are easy to fake). Resultingly, "no win no fee" [[personal injury]] [[solicitors]] exploit this "[[loophole]]" for easy [[Damages|compensation]] money (often a £2500 payout). Ultimately this has resulted in increased [[motor insurance]] premiums, which has had the [[knock-on effect]] of pricing younger drivers off the road.

===Property insurance===

Possible motivations for this can include obtaining payment that is worth more than the value of the property destroyed, or to destroy and subsequently receive payment for goods that could not otherwise be sold.  According to Alfred Manes, the majority of property insurance crimes involve [[arson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idManes1945|Manes, Alfred. "Insurance Crimes."]] p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this is that any evidence that a fire was started by arson is often destroyed by the fire itself.  According to the [[United States Fire Administration]], in the United States there were approximately 31,000 fires caused by arson in 2006, resulting in losses of $755 million.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idUSFA2007|U.S. Fire Administration.

===Council compensation claims===

The fraud involving claims from the [[Municipality|councils]]' insurers suppose staging damages blamable on the local authorities (mostly falls and trips on council owned land) or inflating the value of existing damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allerdale.gov.uk/advice-and-benefits/benefits/housing-benefit/housing-benefit-fraud.aspx |title=Housing and Council Tax Benefit fraud - Allerdale Borough Council |publisher=Allerdale.gov.uk |date=2009-11-02 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detecting insurance fraud==

The detection of insurance fraud generally occurs in two steps.  The first step is to identify suspicious claims that have a higher possibility of being fraudulent.  This can be done by [[computer]]ized [[Statistics|statistical]] analysis or by referrals from [[claims adjuster]]s or insurance agents.  Additionally, the public can provide tips to insurance companies, law enforcement and other organizations regarding suspected, observed, or admitted insurance fraud perpetrated by other individuals. Regardless of the source, the next step is to refer these claims to investigators for further analysis.

Due to the sheer number of claims submitted each day, it would be far too expensive for insurance companies to have employees check each claim for symptoms of fraud.&lt;ref name="bolton236"&gt;[[#Reference-idBolton2002|Bolton, Richard J. “Statistical Fraud Detection.”]] p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, many companies use computers and statistical analysis to identify suspicious claims for further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idDerrig2002|Derrig, Richard A. "Insurance Fraud."]] p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two main types of statistical analysis tools used: supervised and unsupervised.&lt;ref name="bolton236"/&gt;  In both cases, suspicious claims are identified by comparing data about the claim to expected values.  The main difference between the two methods is how the expected values are derived.&lt;ref name="bolton236"/&gt;

In a supervised method, expected values are obtained by analyzing records of both fraudulent and non-fraudulent claims.&lt;ref name="bolton236"/&gt;  According to Richard J. Bolton and David B. Hand, both of Imperial College in London, this method has some drawbacks as it requires absolute certainty that those claims analyzed are actually either fraudulent or non-fraudulent, and because it can only be used to detect types of fraud that have been committed and identified before.&lt;ref name="bolton236"/&gt;

Unsupervised methods of statistical detection, on the other hand, involve detecting claims that are abnormal.&lt;ref name="bolton236"/&gt;  Both claims adjusters and computers can also be trained to identify “red flags,” or symptoms that in the past have often been associated with fraudulent claims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idViaene2002|Viaene, Stijn, et al. "Insurance Claim Fraud Detection."]] p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;  Statistical detection does not prove that claims are fraudulent; it merely identifies suspicious claims that must be investigated further.&lt;ref name="bolton236"/&gt;

Fraudulent claims can be one of two types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lincoln |first1=Robyn |last2=Wells |first2=Helene |last3=Petherick |first3=Wayne |title=An Exploration of Automobile Insurance Fraud |url=https://epublications.bond.edu.au/hss_pubs/64/ |website=Bond University |publisher=Centre for Applied Psychology &amp; Criminology |accessdate=20 October 2018 |date=1 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* they can be otherwise legitimate claims that are exaggerated or “built up,”, or
* they can be false claims in which the damages claimed never actually occurred.
Once a built up claim is identified, insurance companies usually try to negotiate the claim down to the appropriate amount.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idDerrig2002|Derrig, Richard A. "Insurance Fraud."]] p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;  Suspicious claims can also be submitted to “special investigative units”, or SIUs, for further investigation.  These units generally consist of experienced claims adjusters with special training in investigating fraudulent claims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idViaene2002|Viaene, Stijn, et al. "Insurance Claim Fraud Detection."]] p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;  These investigators look for certain symptoms associated with fraudulent claims, or otherwise look for evidence of falsification of some kind.  This evidence can then be used to deny payment of the claims or to prosecute fraudsters if the violation is serious enough.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idGhezzi1983|Ghezzi, Susan Guarino. " Private Network."]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When an insurance company's fraud department investigates a fraud claim, they frequently proceed in two stages: pre-contact and post-contact. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ball |first1=Lindon |date= 31 January 2006 |title=How the detection of insurance fraud succeeds and fails |url= |journal=Psychology, Crime, and Law |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=163-180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the pre-contact stage they analyze all available evidence before they contact the suspect.  They may reviewing submitted paperwork, reach out to third parities, and gather evidence from available sources. Then, in the "post-contact" stage, they interview the suspect to gather more information and, ideally, obtain an incriminating statement. Insurance fraud investigators are trained to question the suspect in a way that precludes the suspect raising a valid defense at a later time. For example, questions about access to claim forms preclude the defense that another individual filled out the fraudulent documents. Common defenses that the suspect interview may preclude include, for example, that the suspect lacked knowledge that their statement was false,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keeton|first1=Page|title=Fraud: The Necessity for an Intent to Deceive|journal=UCLA Law Review|date=1958|issue=4|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/uclalr5&amp;div=38&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; lacked the intention to defraud,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Podgor|first1=Ellen S.|title=Criminal Fraud|journal=American University Law Review|date=1999|volume=48|issue=4|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1330&amp;context=aulr|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or made an ambiguous statement that was later misinterpreted.&lt;ref name="insinterview"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Jessica|last2=Smith|first2=Andrew|title=Representing Individuals in Interviews: The UK Perspective|url=http://globalinvestigationsreview.com/insight/the-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide-to-global-investigations/1079307/representing-individuals-in-interviews-the-uk-perspective|website=Global Investigations Review|publisher=Law Business Research|accessdate=1 August 2017|date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full disclosure may add credibility to a suspect's account of events, but omissions from disclosure or false statements may detract from the suspect's credibility in later interviews or proceedings.&lt;ref name="insinterview"/&gt;

In the context of health insurance, fraud by health insurance companies is sometimes found by comparing revenues from premiums paid against the expenditure by the health insurance companies on claims. For example, in 2006 the Harris County Medical Society, in Texas, had a health insurance rate increase of 22 percent for "consumer-driven" health plan from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas. This was despite the fact that during the previous year Blue Cross had paid out only 9 percent of the collected premium dollars for claims.&lt;ref name="hcfan.3cdn" /&gt;

==Legislation==

National and local governments, especially in the last half of the twentieth century, have recognized insurance fraud as a serious crime, and have made efforts to punish and prevent this practice.  Some major developments are listed below:

===United States===

*Insurance Fraud is specifically classified as a crime in all states, though a minority of states only criminalize certain types (e.g. Oregon only outlaws Worker Compensation and Property Claim fraud).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
*The [[Coalition Against Insurance Fraud]] was founded in 1993 to help fight insurance fraud. This organization collects information on insurance fraud, and is the only anti-fraud alliance speaking for consumers, insurance companies, government agencies and others. Through its unique work, the Coalition empowers consumers to fight back, helps fraud fighters better detect this crime and deters more people from committing fraud. The Coalition supports this mission with a large and continually expanding armory of practical tools: Information, research &amp; data, services and insight as a leading voice of the anti-fraud community.
*Approximately one third of these investigations result in criminal conviction, one third result in denial of the claim, and one third result in payment of the claim.[48]
*19 states require mandatory insurer fraud plans.  This requires companies to form programs to combat fraud and in some cases to develop investigation units to detect fraud.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
*41 states have fraud bureaus.  These are law enforcement agencies where “investigators review fraud reports and begin the prosecution process.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
*Section 1347 of Title 18 of the [[United States Code]] states that whoever attempts or carries out a “scheme or artifice” to “defraud a health care benefit program” will be “fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.”  If this scheme results in bodily injury, the violator may be imprisoned up to 20 years, and if the scheme results in death the violator may be imprisoned for life.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idOffice2006|Office of the Law Revision Counsel, U.S. House of Representatives. "United States Code."]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides making laws more severe, [[Legislation]] has also come up with a list for management that should be implemented so that companies are better suited to combat the possibility of being scammed. That list includes:

*Understanding that fraud does exist and that there is a high possibility for it happening.
*Being fully aware of the dangers and severity of the problem.
*Understanding the importance of the hiring process and how important it is to hire honest individuals.
*Learn to deal with the economic side of business. That means putting procedures and policies in place to catch and deal with individuals trying to commit fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silverstone|first1=Howard|last2=Davia|first2=Horward R.|title=Fraud 101: Techniques and Strategies for Detection|date=April 13, 2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Son, Inc.|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0471721123|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

*The [[Insurance Crime Prevention Bureau]] was founded in 1973 to help fight insurance fraud.  This organization collects information on insurance fraud, and also carries out investigations.  Approximately one third of these investigations result in criminal conviction, one third result in denial of the claim, and one third result in payment of the claim.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idClarke1990|Clarke, Michael. “The Control of Insurance Fraud.”]] p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[British Columbia]]’s Traffic Safety Statutes Amendment Act of 1997 states that any person who submits a motor vehicle insurance claim that contains false or misleading information may on the first offence be fined C$25,000, imprisoned for two years, or both.  On the second offense, that person may be fined C$50,000, imprisoned for two years, or both.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idLegBC1997|Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. "Traffic Safety Statutes Amendment Act."]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
*A major portion of the [[Financial Services Act 1986]] was intended to help prevent fraud.&lt;ref name="staple127"&gt;[[#Reference-idStaple1993|Staple, George. "Serious and Complex Fraud."]] p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Serious Fraud Office, set up under the [[Criminal Justice Act 1987]], was established to “improve the investigation and prosecution of serious and complex fraud.”&lt;ref name="staple127"/&gt;
*The [[Fraud Act 2006]] specifically defines fraud as a crime.  This act defines fraud as being committed when a person “makes a false representation,” “fails to disclose to another person information which he is under a legal duty to disclose,” or abuses a position in which a person is “expected to safeguard, or not to act against, the financial interests of another person.”  This act also defines the penalties for fraud as imprisonment up to ten years, a fine, or both.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idMinistry2006|Ministry of Justice. "Fraud Act 2006."]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:International Civil Rights Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|268px|The promenade as seen in 2012]]
The '''International Civil Rights Walk of Fame''', which honors some of the activists involved in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and others involved in [[civil rights]] activities, was created in 2004 and is located at the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site]] in [[Atlanta]]. It consists of a promenade that showcases the footstep impressions of those honored, marked in granite and bronze. According to the [[National Park Service]], which runs the historic site, the Walk of Fame was created "to give recognition to those courageous soldiers of justice who sacrificed and struggled to make equality a reality for all." Another motivation was to enhance the historic value of the area, enrich its cultural heritage, and make the site a better tourist attraction.

The Walk of Fame is the brainchild of [[Xernona Clayton Brady|Xernona Clayton]], founder and executive producer of the [[Trumpet Awards]]. She is a civil rights figure in her own right. Clayton said, "This is a lasting memorial to those whose contributions were testaments to the fact that human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable. This historic site will serve as a symbol of pride and a beacon of hope for all future generations. We are looking forward to building a monument to the civil struggle that depicts every step taken toward the goal of justice and the tireless exertions and passionate concern of these dedicated individuals."{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2907">The '''Kampala Convention''' (formally, the '''African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa''') is a [[multilateral treaty|treaty]] of the [[African Union]] that addresses [[displaced person|internal displacement]] caused by [[armed conflict]], [[natural disaster]]s and large-scale development projects in Africa.

The Convention was adopted in October 2009. As of 2016 it has been signed by 40 and ratified by 25 of the 54 member states of the [[African Union]]. The Convention entered into force on 6 December 2012, 30 days after its ratification by the 15th state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=ICRC welcomes entry into force of Kampala Convention for displaced persons|date=2012-12-05|accessdate=2012-12-06|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/news-release/2012/12-05-kampala-convention-entry-into-force.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.int/en/treaties|title=OAU/AU Treaties, Conventions, Protocols &amp; Charters|publisher=African Union|accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 5(4) specifically establishes state responsibilities for the protection and assistance of internally displaced persons, whose displacement is the result of "natural or human made disasters, including [[climate change]]".

'''Leszek Nowak''' ([[Więckowice, Tarnów County]], 7 January 1943 – [[Poznań]], 20 October 2009) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[philosopher]] and lawyer.

In 1965, he graduated in law at [[Adam Mickiewicz University]] in Poznan, having written a thesis under the direction of [[Sigmund Ziembiński]]. In 1966 he completed his master's degree in philosophy at the [[University of Warsaw]] under the direction of [[Janina Kotarbinska]]. In 1967 he obtained a doctorate in law, writing on the interpretation of the law, the rule of law and semiotic functions of language, under Ziembiński. He was named assistant professor in 1970 and wrote on the methodological foundations of [[Karl Marx]] . In 1976 he was an associate professor of philosophy, the youngest such professor in Poland, and in 1990 he became a regular professor. In 1994, he became a member of the Academy of Sciences.

In 1965-1970 he worked in the Law Department of Applied Logic UAM, and between 1970 and 1985 in the Institute of Philosophy University. In 1985, he was fired from his job for publishing underground literature. In 1989, he was restored to his previous academic position.

He worked as a visiting professor at the universities of Berlin, Canberra (Australian National University), Catania and Frankfurt. He was a Fellow of the Institutes for Advanced Study in Wassenaar and Berlin. 

In 1975, he founded an international series of bookish Poznan Studies in the Philosophy of the Sciences and the Humanities (published by Rodopi, Amsterdam / New York), where he was editor-in-chief until 2006.

In 1976 he founded a series of Poznan Studies in the Philosophy of Humanities (PWN, now publishing Profit &amp; S-ka Poznan). In the years 1976-1984 he was the editor in chief and co-editor since 1989.

In 2000, he supervised 15 doctoral dissertations. Among those, 8 people received their habilitation, 4 received the title of professor, and two ordinary professor, and one was chosen a corresponding member of Academy of Sciences.

In his socio-political outlook, he strongly approached anarchism.

'''Marine protected areas''' (MPA) are [[protected area]]s of [[sea]]s, [[ocean]]s, [[estuary|estuaries]] or large [[lake]]s. These marine areas can come in many forms ranging from wildlife refuges to research facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/mpa.html|title=What is a marine protect?|last=Administration|first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; MPAs restrict human activity for a conservation purpose, typically to protect natural or cultural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/ecosystems/mpa/ |title=Marine Protected Areas |website=[[National Ocean Service]] |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |accessdate=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such marine resources are protected by local, state, territorial, native, regional, national, or international authorities and differ substantially among and between nations. This variation includes different limitations on development, fishing practices, fishing seasons and catch limits, moorings and bans on removing or disrupting marine life. In some situations (such as with the [[Phoenix Islands Protected Area]]), MPAs also provide revenue for countries, potentially equal to the income that they would have if they were to grant companies permissions to fish.&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Magazine, January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 October 2016 in [[Hobart]], [[Australia]], the [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]] agreed to establish the first [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] and largest marine protected area in the world encompassing 1.55 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (600,000 sq mi) in the [[Ross Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CCAMLR to create world's largest Marine Protected Area|url=https://www.ccamlr.org/en/news/2016/ccamlr-create-worlds-largest-marine-protected-area|accessdate=28 October 2016|agency=Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources|date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other large MPAs are in the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], and [[Atlantic Ocean]]s, in certain [[exclusive economic zone]]s of Australia and overseas territories of [[French overseas departments and territories|France]], the [[British Overseas Territories|United Kingdom]] and the [[Territories of the United States|United States]], with major ({{convert|990,000|km2|sqmi}} or larger) new or expanded MPAs by these nations since 2012&amp;mdash;such as [[Natural Park of the Coral Sea]], [[Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument]], Coral Sea Commonwealth Marine Reserve and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands Marine Protected Area]].&lt;!--- for lead, limit to one large post 2011 example from each named country ---&gt;  When counted with MPAs of all sizes from many other countries, as of August 2016 there are more than 13,650 MPAs, encompassing 2.07% of the world's oceans, with half of that area &amp;ndash; encompassing 1.03% of the world's oceans &amp;ndash; receiving complete "[[Marine protected area#Classifications|no-take"]] designation.&lt;ref name="MPAtlas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpatlas.org/explore/ |title=Explore |work=MPAtlas |publisher=[[Marine Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
"MPA" is an umbrella term for protected areas that includes some area of marine landscape and/or [[biodiversity]]. The [[IUCN]] defines a marine protected area as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Any area of the intertidal or subtidal terrain, together with its overlying water and associated flora, fauna, historical and cultural features, which has been reserved by law or other effective means to protect part or all of the enclosed environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/pa/pa_what/?4646/Marine-Protected-Areas--Why-have-them/ |title=Marine protected areas, why have them? |publisher=IUCN |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2012-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319150803/http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/pa/pa_what/?4646%2FMarine-Protected-Areas--Why-have-them%2F |archivedate=2012-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;An alternative is "a clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated, and managed through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long term conservation of nature with associated [[ecosystem services]] and cultural values".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucn.org/about/union/commissions/wcpa/wcpa_puball/wcpa_pubsubject/wcpa_marinepub/?2135/Towards-Networks-of-Marine-Protected-Areas-The-MPA-Plan-of-Action-for-IUCNs-World-Commission-on-Protected-Areas |title=Towards Networks of Marine Protected Areas - The MPA Plan of Action for IUCN’s World Commission on Protected Areas |publisher=IUCN |date=2008-11-04 |accessdate=2012-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522022607/http://www.iucn.org/about/union/commissions/wcpa/wcpa_puball/wcpa_pubsubject/wcpa_marinepub/?2135%2FTowards-Networks-of-Marine-Protected-Areas-The-MPA-Plan-of-Action-for-IUCNs-World-Commission-on-Protected-Areas |archivedate=2012-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

United States Executive Order 13158 in May 2000 established MPAs, defining them as;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Any area of the marine environment that has been reserved by federal, state, tribal, territorial, or local laws or regulations to provide lasting protection for part or all of the natural and cultural resources therein."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/02/03/2011-2327/nomination-of-existing-marine-protected-areas-to-the-national-system-of-marine-protected-areas-and/ |title=Nomination of Existing Marine Protected Areas to the National System of Marine Protected Areas and Updates to the List of National System Marine Protected Areas |publisher=Federalregister.gov |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] defined the broader term of ''marine and coastal protected area'' (MCPA);&lt;blockquote&gt;"Any defined area within or adjacent to the marine environment, together with its overlying water and associated flora, fauna, historical and cultural features, which has been reserved by legislation or other effective means, including custom, with the effect that its marine and/or coastal biodiversity enjoys a higher level of protection than its surroundings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marine Protected Areas (MPA) |url=http://www.biodiversitya-z.org/areas/46/ |title=Areas of Biodiversity Importance: Marine Protected Areas, 2010 |publisher=Biodiversitya-z.org |date=2010-10-15 |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Classifications ==
[[File:Salomons Atoll in the Chagos.jpg|thumb|The [[Chagos Archipelago]] was declared the world's largest marine reserve in April 2010 with an area of 250,000 square miles until March 2015 when It was declared illegal by the Permanent Court of Arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=22001512/ Foreign and Commonwealth Office, New Protection for Marine Life, April, 2010]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702165420/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=22001512%2F |date=July 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Several types of compliant MPA can be distinguished:
*A totally marine area with no significant terrestrial parts.
*An area containing both marine and terrestrial components, which can vary between two extremes; those that are predominantly maritime with little land (for example, an [[atoll]] would have a tiny island with a significant maritime population surrounding it), or that is mostly terrestrial.
*Marine ecosystems that contain land and [[intertidal]] components only. For example, a [[mangrove forest]] would contain no open sea or ocean marine environment, but its river-like marine ecosystem nevertheless complies with the definition.

IUCN offered seven [[IUCN Protected Area Management Categories|categories of protected area]], based on management objectives and four broad governance types.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Cat
! [[IUCN]] [[Protected Area Management Categories]]:
|-
| &lt;center&gt;'''Ia'''&lt;/center&gt;
| '''Strict nature reserve'''&lt;br&gt;A [[marine reserve]] usually connotes "maximum protection", where all resource removals are strictly prohibited. In countries such as [[Kenya]] and [[Belize]], marine reserves allow for low-risk removals to sustain local communities.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;'''Ib'''&lt;/center&gt;
| '''Wilderness area'''
|-
| &lt;center&gt;'''II'''&lt;/center&gt;
| '''[[National park]]'''&lt;br&gt;[[Marine park]]s emphasize the protection of ecosystems but allow light human use. A marine park may prohibit fishing or extraction of resources, but allow recreation. Some marine parks, such as those in [[Tanzania]], are zoned and allow activities such as fishing only in low risk areas.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;'''III'''&lt;/center&gt;
| '''Natural monuments or features'''&lt;br&gt;Established to protect historical sites such as shipwrecks and cultural sites such as aboriginal fishing grounds.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;'''IV'''&lt;/center&gt;
| '''Habitat/species management area'''&lt;br&gt;Established to protect a certain species, to benefit [[fishery|fisheries]], rare [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]], as spawning/nursing grounds for [[fish]], or to protect entire ecosystems.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;'''V'''&lt;/center&gt;
| '''Protected seascape'''&lt;br&gt;Limited active management, as with protected landscapes.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;'''VI'''&lt;/center&gt;
| '''Sustainable use of natural resources'''

Related [[protected area]] categories include the following;

*[[World Heritage Site]] (WHS)&amp;nbsp;– an area exhibiting extensive natural or cultural history. Maritime areas are poorly represented, however, with only 46 out of over 800 sites.
*[[Man and the Biosphere]] – [[UNESCO]] program that promotes "a balanced relationship between humans and the [[biosphere]]". Under article 4, biosphere reserves must "encompass a mosaic of ecological systems", and thus combine terrestrial, coastal, or marine ecosystems. In structure they are similar to Multiple-use MPAs, with a core area ringed by different degrees of protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/ecological-sciences/man-and-biosphere-programme/ |title=Man and the Biosphere Programme |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar site]] – must meet [[Ramsar Classification System for Wetland Type|certain criteria for the definition of "Wetland"]] to become part of a global system. These sites do not necessarily receive protection, but are indexed by importance for later recommendation to an agency that could designate it a protected area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ramsar.org/pdf/ris/key_ris_e.pdf/ Information Sheet on Ramsar Wetlands] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813143558/http://www.ramsar.org/pdf/ris/key_ris_e.pdf/ |date=August 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While "area" refers to a single contiguous location, terms such as '''"'''''network'''''"''', '''"'''''system'''''"''', and '''"'''''region'''''"''' that group MPAs are not always consistently employed.'''"'''''System'''''"''' is more often used to refer to an individual MPA, whereas '''"'''''region'''''"''' is defined by the [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]] as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A collection of individual MPAs operating cooperatively, at various spatial scales and with a range of protection levels that are designed to meet objectives that a single reserve cannot achieve."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdpa-marine.org/MPAResources/MPAPlanningResources/Docs/Establishing%20resilient%20MPA%20networks-making%20it%20happen.pdf/ WDPA: Establishing Resilient Marine Protected Area Networks — Making It Happen, 2008] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the 2004 [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], the agency agreed to use '''"'''''network'''''"''' on a global level, while adopting ''system'' for national and regional levels. The ''network'' is a mechanism to establish regional and local systems, but carries no authority or mandate, leaving all activity within the '''"'''''system'''''"'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unepscs.org/Refugia_Training/Fisheries%20Refugia%20Concept/15-Differences-Similarities-of-Fisheries-Refugia-and-Marine-Protected-Areas.pdf/ UNEP: Marine Protected Areas and the Concept of Fisheries Refugia, 2006/]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''No take zones'' (NTZs), are areas designated in a number of the world's MPAs, where all forms of exploitation are prohibited and severely limits human activities. These no take zones can cover an entire MPA, or specific portions. For example, the {{convert|1,150,000|km2|sqmi}} [[Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument]], the world's largest MPA (and largest protected area of any type, land or sea), is a 100% no take zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpatlas.org/mpa/sites/68808186/ |title=Papahānaumokuākea (Expansion) Marine National Monument, United States |work=MPAtlas |publisher=[[Marine Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=2016-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923124955/http://www.mpatlas.org/mpa/sites/68808186/ |archivedate=2016-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related terms include; ''specially protected area'' (SPA), ''[[Special Area of Conservation]]'' (SAC), the United Kingdom's ''marine conservation zones'' (MCZs),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/marine/protectandmanage/mpa/conservationzones.aspx/ |title=Marine Conservation Zones |publisher=Naturalengland.org.uk |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''area of special conservation'' (ASC) etc. which each provide specific restrictions.

== Stressors ==
Stressors that affect oceans include "the impact of [[extractive industries]], localised pollution, and changes to its chemistry ([[ocean acidification]]) resulting from elevated [[carbon dioxide]] levels, due to our [[greenhouse gas|emissions]]". MPAs have been cited as the ocean's single greatest hope for increasing the resilience of the marine environment to such stressors.&lt;ref&gt;Laffoley, D. d'A., (ed.) 2008. Towards Networks of Marine Protected Areas. The MPA Plan of Action for IUCN's World Commission on Protected Areas. IUCN WCPA, Gland, Switzerland. 28 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Well-designed and managed MPAs developed with input and support from interested stakeholders can conserve biodiversity and protect and restore [[fisheries]].

== Economics ==
MPAs can help sustain local economies by supporting fisheries and tourism.  For example, [[Apo Island]] in the [[Philippines]] made protected one quarter of their reef, allowing fish to recover, jumpstarting their economy. This was shown in the film, ''Resources at Risk: Philippine Coral Reef''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;Christie, P. and A.T. White. 2007. Best practices for improved governance of coral reef marine protected areas. Coral Reefs 26:1047-1056.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 report by the [[Center for Development and Strategy]] found that programs like the [[United States National Marine Sanctuary]] system can develop considerable economic benefits for communities through [[Public–private partnership]]s.&lt;ref name="Joint-Value Creation Between Marine Protected Areas and the Private Sector"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harary|first1=David|title=Joint-Value Creation Between Marine Protected Areas and the Private Sector|url=http://www.thinkcds.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Final_MPA_Harary.pdf|website=thinkcds.org|publisher=Center for Development and Strategy|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==

Typical MPAs restrict [[fishing]], [[Petrochemicals|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] mining and/or [[tourism]]. Other restrictions may limit the use of [[ultrasonics|ultrasonic]] devices like [[sonar]] (which may confuse the guidance system of [[cetaceans]]), development, construction and the like. Some fishing restrictions include "no-take" zones, which means that no fishing is allowed. Less than 1% of US MPAs are no-take.

Ship transit can also be restricted or banned, either as a preventive measure or to avoid direct disturbance to individual species. The degree to which environmental regulations affect shipping varies according to whether MPAs are located in [[territorial waters]], [[exclusive economic zone]]s, or the [[high seas]]. The [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|law of the sea]] regulates these limits.

Most MPAs have been located in territorial waters, where the appropriate government can enforce them. However, MPAs have been established in exclusive economic zones and in [[international waters]]. For example, Italy, France and Monaco in 1999 jointly established a cetacean sanctuary in the [[Ligurian Sea]] named the [[Pelagos Sanctuary for Mediterranean Marine Mammals]]. This sanctuary includes both national and international waters. Both the [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]] and [[IUCN]] recommended a variety of management systems for use in a protected area system. They advocated that MPAs be seen as one of many "nodes" in a network of protected areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep-wcmc.org/marine-protected-areas_470.html/ |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111220214403/http://www.unep-wcmc.org/marine-protected-areas_470.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-12-20 |title=Marine Protected Area Networks |publisher=Unep-Wcmc |date=2011-01-18 |accessdate=2012-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are the most common management systems:

[[File:Asinara-Island01.jpg|thumb|right|Asinara, Italy is listed by WDPA as both a marine reserve and a national marine park, and as such could be labelled 'multiple-use'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/Area_Naturale_Marina_Protetta_Isola_Dell_Asinara_Natural_Marine_Reserve_And_Natural_Protected_Marine_Areas/ |title=Asinara Natural Marine Reserve |publisher=Protectedplanet.net |accessdate=2012-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608184308/http://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/Area_Naturale_Marina_Protetta_Isola_Dell_Asinara_Natural_Marine_Reserve_And_Natural_Protected_Marine_Areas |archivedate=2012-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Seasonal and temporary management'''—Activities, most critically fishing, are restricted seasonally or temporarily, e.g., to protect spawning/nursing grounds or to let a rapidly reducing species recover.

'''Multiple-use MPAs'''—These are the most common and arguably the most effective. These areas employ two or more protections. The most important sections get the highest protection, such as a no take zone and are surrounded with areas of lesser protections.

'''Community involvement and related approaches'''—Community-managed MPAs empower local communities to operate partially or completely independent of the governmental jurisdictions they occupy. Empowering communities to manage resources can lower conflict levels and enlist the support of diverse groups that rely on the resource such as subsistence and commercial fishers, scientists, recreation, tourism businesses, youths and others.

===Marine Protected Area Networks===
{{main|Marine Protected Area Network}}
'''Marine Protected Area Networks''' or '''MPA networks''' have been defined as "A group of MPAs that interact with one another ecologically and/or socially form a network".&lt;ref name="Christie, P. 2007"&gt;Christie, P., and A. T. White. "Best Practices for Improved Governance of Coral Reef Marine Protected Areas." Coral Reefs 26.4 (2007): 1047-056. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

These networks are intended to connect individuals and MPAs and promote education and cooperation among various administrations and user groups. "MPA networks are, from the perspective of resource users, intended to address both environmental and socio-economic needs, complementary ecological and social goals and designs need greater research and policy support".&lt;ref name="Christie, P. 2007" /&gt;

Filipino communities connect with one another to share information about MPAs, creating a larger network through the social communities' support.&lt;ref&gt;Lowry, G. K., A. T. White, and P. Christie. "Scaling Up to Networks of Marine Protected Areas in the Philippines: Biophysical, Legal, Institutional, and Social Considerations." Coastal Management 37.3 (2009): 274-90. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Emerging or established MPA networks can be found in [[Commonwealth marine reserves#Commonwealth marine reserve networks|Australia]], Belize, the [[Red Sea]], [[Gulf of Aden]] and Mexico.&lt;ref name="Christie, P. 2007" /&gt;

==International efforts==

The 17th [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) General Assembly in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], California, the 19th IUCN assembly and the fourth World Parks Congress all proposed to centralise the establishment of protected areas. The [[Earth Summit 2002|World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in 2002 called for {{quote|the establishment of marine protected areas consistent with international laws and based on scientific information, including representative networks by 2012.&lt;ref name="Wells13"&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|Sheppard|van Lavieren|Barnard|2008|p=13|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The Evian agreement, signed by [[G8|G8 Nations]] in 2003, agreed to these terms. The Durban Action Plan, developed in 2003, called for regional action and targets to establish a network of protected areas by 2010 within the jurisdiction of regional [[Environmental science|environmental protocols]].It recommended establishing protected areas for 20 to 30% of the world's oceans by the goal date of 2012. The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] considered these recommendations and recommended requiring countries to set up marine parks controlled by a central organization before merging them. The [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] agreed to the terms laid out by the convention, and in 2004, its member nations committed to the following targets;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/nationalregional08well|title=National and Regional Networks of Marine Protected Areas: A Review of Progress|first=S.|last=Wells|date=23 May 2018|publisher=UNEP-WCMC / UNEP|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*By 2006 complete an area system gap analysis at national and regional levels.
*By 2008 address the less represented marine ecosystems, accounting for those beyond national jurisdiction in accordance.
*By 2009 designate the protected areas identified through the gap analysis.
*By 2012 complete the establishment of a comprehensive and ecologically representative network.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The establishment by 2010 of terrestrial and by 2012 for marine areas of '''comprehensive, effectively managed, and ecologically representative national and regional systems of protected areas''' that collectively, inter alia through a global network, contribute to achieving the three objectives of the Convention and the 2010 target to significantly reduce the current late of [[biodiversity loss]] at the global, regional, national, and sub-national levels and contribute to poverty reduction and the pursuit of sustainable development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/?id=7765/ |title=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Decision VII/28 |publisher=Cbd.int |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The UN later endorsed another decision, Decision VII/15, in 2006:
{{quote|Effective conservation of 10% of each of the world's ecological regions by 2010.&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt; – [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] Decision VII/15&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/?id=7752/ |title=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Decision VII/15 |publisher=Cbd.int |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Global treaties===
====United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea====

====The Antarctic Treaty System====
On 7 April 1982, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CAMLR Convention) came into force after discussions began in 1975 between parties of the then-current [[Antarctic Treaty]] to limit large-scale exploitation of [[krill]] by commercial fisheries. The Convention bound contracting nations to abide by previously agreed upon Antarctic territorial claims and peaceful use of the region while protecting ecosystem integrity south of the [[Antarctic Convergence]] and [[60th parallel south|60 S latitude]]. In so doing, it also established a commission of the original signatories and acceding parties called the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to advance these aims through protection, scientific study, and rational use, such as harvesting, of those marine resources. Though separate, the Antarctic Treaty and CCAMLR, make up part the broader system of international agreements called the Antarctic Treaty System. Since 1982, the CCAMLR meets annually to implement binding conservations measures like the creation of 'protected areas' at the suggestion of the convention's scientific committee.

In 2009, the CCAMLR created the first 'high-seas' MPA entirely within international waters over the southern shelf of the [[South Orkney Islands]]. This area encompasses {{convert|94,000|km2|sqmi}} and all fishing activity including transhipment, and dumping or discharge of waste is prohibited with the exception of scientific research endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protection of the South Orkney Islands southern shelf|url=https://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-91-03-2009|website=https://www.ccamlr.org|publisher=Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 October 2016, the CCAMLR, composed of 24 member countries and the European Union at the time, agreed to establish the world's largest marine park encompassing 1.55 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (600,000 sq mi) in the Ross Sea after several years of failed negotiations. Establishment of the Ross Sea MPA required unanimity of the commission members and enforcement will begin in December 2017. However, due to a sunset provision inserted into the proposal, the new marine park will only be in force for 35 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CCAMLR to create world's largest Marine Protected Area|url=https://www.ccamlr.org/en/news/2016/ccamlr-create-worlds-largest-marine-protected-area|accessdate=29 October 2016|publisher=Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources|date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Targets===

Many countries have established national targets, accompanied by action plans and implementations. The UN Council identified the need for countries to collaborate with each other to establish effective regional conservation plans. Some national targets are listed in the table below&lt;ref name="Wells15" &gt;{{harvnb|Wells|Sheppard|van_Lavieren|Barnard|2008|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National efforts==

The marine protected area network is still in its infancy. As of October 2010, approximately 6,800 MPAs had been established, covering 1.17% of global ocean area. Protected areas covered 2.86% of exclusive economic zones (EEZs).&lt;ref name="iucn.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/publications_doc/publications/?6500/Global-ocean-protection--present-status-and-future-possibilities/ |title=Global Ocean Protection: Present Status and Future Possibilities |publisher=Iucn.org |date=2010-11-23 |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; MPAs covered 6.3% of territorial seas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Host.aspx?Content=Products/ProgressReports.htm/ |title=UN (2010) Millennium Development Goals Report – Addendum |publisher=Mdgs.un.org |accessdate=2012-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927112249/https://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Host.aspx?Content=Products%2FProgressReports.htm%2F |archive-date=2017-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many prohibit the use of harmful fishing techniques yet only 0.01% of the ocean's area is designated as a "no take zone".&lt;ref&gt;Christie, Patrick, and A.T White.

====South Africa====

[[Image:TMNP MPA boundaries.png|thumb|360px|Boundaries of the Table Mountain National Park Marine Protected Area (yellow) and the associated restricted areas (orange).]]

The '''Table Mountain National Park Marine Protected Area''' is a [[marine protected area]] around the [[Cape Peninsula]], in the vicinity of [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]  It was proclaimed in Government Gazette No. 26431 of 4 June 2004 in terms of the [[Marine Natural Resources Act, 18 of 1998]].&lt;ref name="Gazette 26431" &gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.sanparks.org/parks/table_mountain/library/mpa_gove_note.pdf |date=4 June 2004 |title=Government Notice 695: Marine Living Resources Act (18/1998): Notice declaring the Table Mountain National Park Marine Protected Area under section 43 |journal=Government Gazette |pages=3-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MPA is of value for [[conservation]] of a wide range of [[Endemism|endemic]] species, and has considerable economic value as a tourist destination. It encloses a large number of [[recreational dive sites]] visited by local residents and tourists from further afield. The shark and [[whale watching]] tourist industries are also represented, and there are several popular [[Surfing|surf breaks]]. The MPA includes controlled zones where extractive activities are allowed under permit, and smaller no-take zones. The MPA is administrated by the [[Table Mountain National Park]], a branch of [[South African National Parks|SANParks]]. 

The marine ecology is unusually varied for an area of this size, as a result of the meeting of two major oceanic water masses near [[Cape Point]], and the park extends into two coastal marine [[bioregion]]s. The ecology of the west or "Atlantic Seaboard" side of the park is noticeably different in character and [[biodiversity]] to that of the east, or "False Bay" side. Both sides are classified as temperate waters, but there is a significant difference in average temperature, with the Atlantic side being noticeably colder.&lt;ref name="MPA Forum" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://mpaforum.org.za/portfolio/table-mountain-national-park-mpa-2/ |title=Table Mountain National Park |author=&lt;!--not specified--&gt; |website=MPA Forum South Africa |accessdate=26 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MPA contains culturally significant fish traps, historicalwrecks and traditional fishing communities, and is also important for commercial fisheries. Part of the  West Coast rock lobster industry takes place within the MPA – as well as recreational and subsistence fishers, and an illegal poaching industry mostly targeting abalone, rock lobster and territorial linefish from the no-take zones.&lt;ref name="MPA Forum" /&gt;

===Greater Caribbean===

[[File:Location Caribbean.png|thumb|300px|The [[Caribbean]] region; the UNEP–defined region also includes the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. This region is encompassed by the [[Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System]] proposal, and the Caribbean challenge]]
[[File:GulfofMexico3D.jpg|thumb|The [[Gulf of Mexico]] region (in 3D) is encompassed by the "Islands in the Stream" proposal.]]
The [[Caribbean|Greater Caribbean]] subdivision encompasses an area of about {{convert|5700000|km2}} of ocean and 38 nations. The area includes island countries like the [[Bahamas]] and [[Cuba]], and the majority of [[Central America]]. The Convention for Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region (better known as the [[Curitiba#UN Convention on Biodiversity|Cartagena Convention]]) was established in 1983. [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety|Protocols involving protected areas]] were ratified in 1990. As of 2008, the region hosted about 500 MPAs. [[Coral reef]]s are the best represented.

Two networks are under development, the [[Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System]] (a long [[Coral reef|barrier reef]] that borders the coast of much of Central America), and the "Islands in the Stream" program (covering the [[Gulf of Mexico]]).&lt;ref name="Wells33"&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|Sheppard|van_Lavieren|Barnard|2008|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southeast Asia===
Southeast Asia is a global epicenter for marine diversity. 12% of its coral reefs are in MPAs. The Philippines have some the world's best coral reefs and protect them to attract international tourism. Most of the Philippines' MPAs are established to secure protection for its coral reef and [[sea grass]] habitats. Indonesia has MPAs designed for tourism and relies on tourism as a main source of income.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

==== Philippines ====
The [[Philippines]] host one of the most highly biodiverse regions, with 464 reef-building coral species. Due to overfishing, destructive fishing techniques, and rapid coastal development, these are in rapid decline. The country has established some 600 MPAs. However, the majority are poorly enforced and are highly ineffective. However, some have positively impacted reef health, increased fish biomass, decreased coral bleaching and increased yields in adjacent fisheries. One notable example is the MPA surrounding Apo Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reefbase.org/key_topics/pdf/Philippines%20mpa.pdf|title=Summary Report for MPAs in the Philippines|author=|date=|website=reefbase.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===

[[Latin America]] has designated one large MPA system. As of 2008, 0.5% of its marine environment was protected, mostly through the use of small, multiple-use MPAs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|Sheppard|van_Lavieren|Barnard|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Pacific===

The South Pacific network ranges from [[Belize]] to [[Chile]]. Governments in the region adopted the [[List of international environmental agreements#Marine environment – global conventions|Lima convention]] and action plan in 1981. An MPA-specific protocol was ratified in 1989. The permanent commission on the exploitation and conservation on the marine resources of the South Pacific promotes the exchange of studies and information among participants.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The region is currently running one comprehensive cross-national program, the Tropical Eastern Pacific Marine Corridor Network, signed in April 2004. The network covers about {{convert|211000000|km2}}.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

One alternative to imposing MPAs on an indigenous population is through the use of [[Indigenous Protected Areas]], such as those in Australia.

===North Pacific===

The North Pacific network covers the western coasts of Mexico, Canada, and the U.S. The "Antigua Convention" and an action plan for the north Pacific region were adapted in 2002. Participant nations manage their own national systems.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In 2010-2011, the State of California completed hearings and actions via the state Department of Fish and Game to establish new MPAs.{{Citation needed|date = December 2014}}

===United States and Pacific Island Territories===
President [[Barack Obama]] signed a proclamation on September 25, 2014, designating the world's largest marine reserve. The proclamation expanded the existing [[Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument]], one of the world's most pristine tropical marine environments, to six times its current size, encompassing {{Convert|490000|sqmi}} of protected area around these islands. Expanding the Monument protected the area's unique deep coral reefs and seamounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/24/fact-sheet-president-obama-designate-largest-marine-monument-world-limit President Obama Designates Largest Marine Monument] 25 Sept 2014 Retrieved 25 Sept 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, California adopted the [[Marine Life Protection Act]], establishing the first state law requiring a comprehensive, science-based MPA network. The state created the [[Marine Life Protection Act|Marine Life Protection Act Initiative]]. The MLPA Blue Ribbon Task Force and stakeholder and scientific advisory groups ensure that the process uses the science and public participation.

The MLPA Initiative established a plan to create California's statewide MPA network by 2011 in several steps. The Central Coast step was successfully completed in September, 2007.  The North Central Coast step was completed in 2010.  The South Coast and North Coast steps were expected to go into effect in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Fish and Game.

===Europe===

The [[Natura 2000]] [[ecological network|ecological MPA network]] in the [[European Union]] included MPAs in the [[North Atlantic]], the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]]. The member states had to define NATURA 2000 areas at sea in their [[Exclusive Economic Zone]].

Two assessments, conducted thirty years apart, of three Mediterranean MPAs, demonstrate that proper protection allows commercially valuable and slow-growing red coral ([[Corallium rubrum]]) to produce large colonies in shallow water of less than {{convert|50|m}}. Shallow-water colonies outside these decades-old MPAs are typically very small. The MPAs are [[Banyuls]], [[Carry-le-Rouet]] and Scandola, off the island of [[Corsica]].&lt;ref name=sd&gt;{{cite journal

Managers and scientists use [[geographic information system]]s and [[remote sensing]] to map and analyze MPAs.

== Coral reefs ==
Coral reef systems have been in decline worldwide. Causes include overfishing, pollution and [[ocean acidification]]. As of 2013 30% of the world's reefs were severely damaged. Approximately 60% will be lost by 2030 without enhanced protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pandolfi|first=J.M.|title=Global trajectories of long-term decline of coral reef ecosystems|journal=Science|volume=301|year=2003|issue=5635|pages=955–958|doi=10.1126/science.1085706 |display-authors=etal|pmid=12920296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marine reserves with "no take zones" are the most effective form of protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=T.P.|title=Climate change, human impacts, and the resilience of coral reefs|journal=Science|volume=301|year=2003|issue=5635|pages=929–933| doi=10.1126/science.1085046 |display-authors=etal|pmid=12920289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only about 0.01% of the world's coral reefs are inside effective MPAs.&lt;ref name="MoraScience2006"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.soc.hawaii.edu/mora/Publications/Mora%20015.pdf | author=Mora C. | year=2006 | title=Coral reefs and the global network of Marine Protected Areas | journal=Science | volume = 312 | issue=5781 | pages = 1750–1751 |format=PDF| pmid=16794065 | author2=Andrèfouët, S | author3=Costello, M.

== Fish ==
MPAs can be an effective tool to maintain fish populations; see [[refuge (ecology)]]. The general concept is to create overpopulation within the MPA. The fish expand into the surrounding areas to reduce crowding, increasing the population of unprotected areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://innri.unuftp.is/pdf/Marine%20Protected%20Areas.pdf|title=Marine Protected Areas (Innri)|author=|date=|website=unuftp.is}}&lt;/ref&gt; This helps support local fisheries in the surrounding area, while maintaining a healthy population within the MPA. Such MPAs are most commonly used for coral reef ecosystems.

One example is at Goat Island Bay in New Zealand, established in 1977. Research gathered at Goat Bay documented the spillover effect. "Spillover and larval export—the drifting of millions of eggs and larvae beyond the reserve—have become central concepts of marine conservation". This positively impacted commercial fishermen in surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;Warne, Kennedy. [http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/04/table-of-contents] "Saving the Sea's Bounty"] National Geographic. April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another unexpected result of MPAs is their impact on predatory marine species, which in some conditions can increase in population. When this occurs, prey populations decrease. One study showed that in 21 out of 39 cases, "trophic cascades," caused a decrease in herbivores, which led to an increase in the quantity of plant life. (This occurred in the Malindi Kisite and Watamu Marian National Parks in Kenya; the Leigh Marine Reserve in New Zealand; and Brackett's Landing Conservation Area in the US.&lt;ref&gt;MPA News, [https://mpanews.openchannels.org/mpanews/issue/july-2004-61 Vol. 6 No. 1, July 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Success criteria ==
Both [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]] and [[IUCN]] have criteria for setting up and maintaining MPA networks, which emphasize 4 factors:&lt;ref name="Wells17"&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|Sheppard|van_Lavieren|Barnard|2008|p=17}}
The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] defines a ''protected area'' as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated, and managed, through legal or effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem service and cultural value."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Adequacy'''—ensuring that the sites have the size, shape, and distribution to ensure the success of selected species.
*'''Representability'''—protection for all of the local environment's biological processes
*'''Resilience'''—the resistance of the system to natural disaster, such as a tsunami or flood.
*'''Connectivity'''—maintaining population links across nearby MPAs.

== Misconceptions ==
Misconceptions about MPAs include the belief that all MPAs are no-take or no-fishing areas. However, less than 1 percent of US waters are no-take areas. MPA activities can include consumption fishing, diving and other activities.

Another misconception is that most MPAs are federally managed. Instead, MPAs are managed under hundreds of laws and jurisdictions. They can be exist in state, commonwealth, territory and tribal waters.

Another misconception is that a federal mandate dedicates a set percentage of ocean to MPAs. Instead the mandate requires an evaluation of current MPAs and creates a public resource on current MPAs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mpa.gov/pdf/helpful-resources/factsheets/mpamisconceptions2.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215150109/http://mpa.gov/pdf/helpful-resources/factsheets/mpamisconceptions2.pdf |date=February 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Some existing and proposed MPAs have been criticized by indigenous populations and their supporters, as impinging on land usage rights. For example, the proposed Chagos Protected Area in the Chagos Islands is contested by [[Chagossians]] deported from their homeland in 1965 by the [[United Kingdom|British]] as part of the creation of the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] (BIOT). According to [[WikiLeaks]] [[CableGate]] documents,&lt;ref name="[http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2010/12/23/18667425.php]"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2010/12/23/18667425.php |title=WikiLeaks reveals U.S., British use marine reserves as tool of imperialism |accessdate=2010-12-24 |date=2009-05-15 |work=Embassy London}}&lt;/ref&gt; the UK proposed that the BIOT become a "marine reserve" with the aim of preventing the former inhabitants from returning to their lands and to protect the joint UK/US military base on [[Diego Garcia]] Island.

Other critiques include: their cost (higher than that of passive management), conflicts with human development goals, inadequate scope to address factors such as climate change and invasive species.&lt;ref name="MoraAndSale2011" /&gt;

== Recent research ==
[[File:Zebrasoma flavescens Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|right|The larvae of the [[yellow tang]] can drift more than 100 miles and reseed in a distant location.&lt;ref name=Christie2010 /&gt;]]

In 2010, one study found that [[fish larvae]] can drift on ocean currents and reseed [[fish stock]]s at a distant location. This finding demonstrated that fish populations can be connected to distant locations through the process of larval drift.&lt;ref name=Christie2010&gt;Christie MR, Tissot BN, Albins MA, Beets3 JP, Jia Y, Ortiz DL, Thompson SE, Hixon MA (2010) [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0015715 Larval Connectivity in an Effective Network of Marine Protected Areas] ''PLoS ONE'', '''5'''(12) {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0015715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They investigated the [[yellow tang]], because larva of this species stay in the general area of the reef in which they first settle.&lt;ref name=ScienceDaily /&gt; The tropical yellow tang is heavily fished by the [[aquarium]] trade. By the late 1990s, their stocks were collapsing. Nine MPAs were established off the coast of Hawaii to protect them. Larval drift has helped them establish themselves in different locations, and the fishery is recovering.&lt;ref name=ScienceDaily /&gt; "We've clearly shown that fish larvae that were spawned inside marine reserves can drift with currents and replenish fished areas long distances away," said coauthor Mark Hixon.&lt;ref name=ScienceDaily&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/12/101222173105.htm Drifting Fish Larvae Allow Marine Reserves to Rebuild Fisheries] ''ScienceDaily '', 26 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1511">'''''Molien v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals''''', {{law report|27|Cal. 3d|916}} (1980), was a [[legal case|case]] decided by the [[Supreme Court of California]] that first recognized that a "direct victim" of [[negligence]] can recover damages for emotional distress without an accompanying physical injury.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J.A., et al.  ''The Torts Process, Seventh Edition.''  Aspen Publishers, New York, NY: 2007, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Factual background==
A doctor employed by the defendant hospital incorrectly diagnosed a patient as having [[syphilis]].  The doctor encouraged the patient to disclose the illness to her husband, and when she communicated the erroneous diagnosis to her husband, their marital relationship was destroyed. When it was determined that the diagnosis was incorrect, the husband brought an action against the hospital for negligent infliction of emotional distress. 

==Decision==
The court ruled that the risk of harm to the husband of the patient from a misdiagnosis was reasonably foreseeable, and that the tortious conduct was directed at the patient and her husband.  As a "direct victim," the strict criteria for [[negligent infliction of emotional distress]] need not be fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J.A., p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1515">A '''National Securities Identifying Number''', or '''NSIN''', is a generic nine-digit alpha numeric code which identifies a [[fungible]] [[security (finance)|security]]. The NSIN is issued by a [[national numbering agency]] (NNA) designated for that country. Regional substitute NNAs have been allocated the task of functioning as NNAs in those countries where NNAs have not yet been established.  NSINs are used as part of the makeup of a product's [[International Securities Identifying Number|ISIN]].

==Sample NNA and NSIN designations==
* In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] the NNA is the CUSIP Services Bureau and the NSIN is the [[CUSIP]].
* In the [[United Kingdom]], the NNA is the [[London Stock Exchange]] and the NSIN is the [[SEDOL]].
* In [[France]], the NNA is [[Euroclear France]] and the NSIN used to be the [[Sicovam]]. As of July 1, 2003 SICOVAMs are no longer issued, [[ISIN]]s being used instead.
* In [[Germany]], the NNA is [[Wertpapier-Mitteilungen]] and the NSIN is the [[Wertpapierkennummer|WKN]].
* In [[Switzerland]], the NNA is [[SIX Financial Information]] and the NSIN is the [[Valoren|Valor Number]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11158">The '''nationality law of the Federated States of Micronesia''' determines who is or may become a citizen or national of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] (FSM). Article III of the [[Constitution of the Federated States of Micronesia]] provides the basis for nationality law, while specific provisions are elaborated in 7 FSMC § 201 ''et seq''.

==History==
Prior to the establishment of the Federated States of Micronesia, there existed the status of citizen of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]].&lt;ref name="USCIS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/complete-correct-form-i-9/complete-section-1-employee-information-and-verification/federated-states-micronesia-republic-marshall-islands-and-palau|title=Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Palau|publisher=United States Citizenship and Immigration Services|date=2011-11-29|accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trust Territory citizenship could be acquired through ''[[jus soli]]'' by birth in the Trust Territory (except if another citizenship was acquired at birth or later), through ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' in the case of a person born outside the Trust Territory to parents who were citizens of the Trust Territory by taking up residence in the Trust Territory before age 21, or by [[naturalization]] upon approval by the [[High Commissioner of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands|High Commissioner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://fsmlaw.org/fsm/code/title07/T07_Ch01.htm|chapter=Chapter 1: Trust Territory Citizenship|title=FSMC, Title 7: Citizenship|publisher=Legal Information System|location=Federated States of Micronesia|accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution, "A person who is a citizen of the Trust Territory immediately prior to the effective date of this Constitution and a domiciliary of a District ratifying this Constitution is a citizen and national of the Federated States of Micronesia."&lt;ref name="Constitution"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.fsmlaw.org/fsm/constitution/constitution.htm|title=Constitution of the Federated States of Micronesia|publisher=Legal Information System|location=Federated States of Micronesia|accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article III, Sections 4 and 5 of the Constitution provided for a period of six months within which certain other Trust Territory citizens could become citizens and nationals of the FSM upon application to an FSM court: domiciliaries of other [[districts of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]], and people who became [[United States national]]s under the [[Covenant to establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]].&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt;

==General provisions==
After independence, citizenship of the Federated States of Micronesia is based on ''[[jus sanguinis]]''. Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution provides that "a person born of parents one or both of whom are citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia is a citizen and national of the Federated States by birth".&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapter2"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://fsmlaw.org/fsm/code/title07/T07_Ch02.htm|chapter=Chapter 2: Federated States of Micronesia Citizenship|title=FSMC, Title 7: Citizenship|publisher=Legal Information System|location=Federated States of Micronesia|accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dual citizenship==
Article III, Section 3 of the Constitution, as well as 7 FSMC § 201, prohibit dual citizenship, stating that "A citizen of the Federated States of Micronesia who is recognized as a citizen of another nation shall, within 3 years of his 18th birthday, or within 3 years of the effective date of this Constitution, whichever is later, register his intent to remain a citizen of the Federated States and renounce his citizenship of another nation. If he fails to comply with this Section, he becomes a national of the Federated States of Micronesia."&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapter2"/&gt;

In 2004, Public Law 13-65 proposed to repeal Article III, Section 3 of the constitution, which as President [[Joseph Urusemal]] described it, "eliminates the constitutional barrier to dual citizenship", but would not actually permit dual citizenship unless [[Congress of the Federated States of Micronesia|Congress]] passed legislation defining cases in which dual citizenship would be permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fsmgov.org/press/pr12300a.htm|title=Newly signed laws include changes to the Constitution|work=FSM Information Services|date=2004-12-30|accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; When put to a referendum during the [[Micronesian parliamentary election, 2005|2005 elections]], however, this amendment failed to garner the 75% support in the popular vote that it required in order to become effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fsmgov.org/press/pr031405.htm|title=National elections maintains incumbents and denies changes to Constitution|work=FSM Information Services|date=2005-03-14|accessdate=2014-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naturalization==
Naturalization is the conferral of FSM citizenship on an alien, or on an FSM national who is not a citizen.&lt;ref name="NaturalizationRegulations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmpio.fm/announcements/Naturalization_Regulation_Immigration.pdf|title=Naturalization Regulations|publisher=Office of the President|location=Federated States of Micronesia|accessdate=2014-01-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206195910/http://www.fsmpio.fm/announcements/Naturalization_Regulation_Immigration.pdf|archivedate=2010-12-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalization procedures originally only applied to foreigners, but in 2008, Public Law 15-27 created procedures for FSM nationals to become FSM citizens as well, if they [[renunciation of citizenship|renounced the citizenship of other countries]] and followed certain other procedures.&lt;ref name="IslandsBusiness20131108"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/federated-states-of-micronesia/3529/sei-uemoto-first-fsm-national-to-become-fsm-citize/|title=Sei Uemoto: first FSM national to become FSM citizen under changed immigration law|work=Islands Business|date=2013-11-08|accessdate=2014-01-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115062743/http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/federated-states-of-micronesia/3529/sei-uemoto-first-fsm-national-to-become-fsm-citize/|archivedate=2014-01-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalization is provided for in 7 FSMC § 204.&lt;ref name="Chapter2"/&gt; Under regulations, naturalization requires a [[language assessment]] to confirm that the applicant has "an ability to
read, write, and speak in words in ordinary usage" in [[languages of the Federated States of Micronesia|the language]] of the [[Administrative divisions of the Federated States of Micronesia|state]] where he or she resides.&lt;ref name="NaturalizationRegulations"/&gt; Naturalization may be cancelled pursuant to § 205. Furthermore, under § 208, "any person who obtains naturalization through concealment of a material fact or willful misrepresentation in applying for naturalization, upon conviction thereof, shall be imprisoned for a period of not more than two years, or fined not more than $10,000, or both."&lt;ref name="Chapter2"/&gt;

Naturalization is quite difficult to obtain.&lt;ref name="MicSem"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.micsem.org/pubs/conferences/frames/placeforfr.htm|title=Is There a Place for Foreigners in Micronesia|work=Micronesian Seminar|number=7|date=1994-04-13|accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1994, very few foreigners had been granted citizenship.&lt;ref name="MicSem"/&gt; 7 FSMC § 204 requires "Congress' recommendation by bill" prior to the President naturalizing a person as a citizen of the Federated States of Micronesia.&lt;ref name="Chapter2"/&gt; According to the ''[[United States' Country Reports on Human Rights Practices]]'', Congress exercised this power for the first time only in 1998, and continues to exercise it only on rare occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://m.state.gov/md8351.htm|chapter=Micronesia, Federated States of|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|publisher=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State|date=2002-03-04|accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2012/eap/204220.htm|chapter=Micronesia, Federated States of|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|publisher=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State|date=2013-04-19|accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Sei Francis Uemoto, the Pohnpei-born son of a [[Japanese settlement in the Federated States of Micronesia|Japanese immigrant]] father and Pohnpeian mother, who had lived in Japan until 1983 and since then in Pohnpei, became the first FSM national to be naturalized as an FSM citizen under the new procedures since 2008.&lt;ref name="IslandsBusiness20131108"/&gt;

==Loss of citizenship==
7 FSMC § 206 names five grounds for [[loss of citizenship|loss]] of FSM citizenship. The first of these is "voluntarily obtain[ing] naturalization in a foreign state upon one's application".&lt;ref name="Chapter2"/&gt; Though thousands of FSM citizens move to the United States under the [[Compact of Free Association]], according to a U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] report, few migrants from countries with Compacts of Free Association with the United States take action to become U.S. citizens, as an example citing data from the former Immigration and Naturalization Service that only 7 FSM citizens naturalized as U.S. citizens in 1998. (FSM citizens must still qualify for [[Permanent residence (United States)|U.S. permanent residence]] through normal procedures in order to qualify for naturalization, and the CFA does not offer them special privileges in this regard.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d0240.pdf|title=Migration From Micronesian Nations Has Had Significant Impact on Guam, Hawaii, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands|publisher=United States Government Accountability Office|date=October 2001|accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining four grounds for loss of FSM citizenship are:&lt;ref name="Chapter2"/&gt;
#voluntarily taking an oath or making an affirmation or other formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign state or political subdivision thereof;
#voluntarily entering, or serving in, the armed forces of a foreign state, with certain exceptions for service in the [[United States Armed Forces]]
#voting in a political election in a foreign state where a prerequisite to such a vote is citizenship of that foreign state; or
#if over 18 years of age, voluntarily making a formal renunciation of FSM citizenship.

Additionally, 7 FSMC § 204 provides that a dual citizen who does not "register his intent to remain a citizen of the Federated States and renounce his citizenship of another nation" becomes a national rather than a citizen.&lt;ref name="Chapter2"/&gt;

A '''Neo-classical contract''' is a form of contract, defined by McNeil, describing a [[contract]] dependent upon [[wikt:trilateral|trilateral]] governance, in which "[[wikt:third party|third party]] assistance" is used  for resolving disputes or evaluating performance.&lt;ref&gt;I.R. Macneil, “Contracts: adjustment of long-term economic relations under classical, neoclassical, and relational contract law” (1977) ''Northwestern University Law Review'' vol:72 pg:854 .&lt;/ref&gt; Such contracts form a distinct group, along with classical and relational contracts, in McNeil's system of classification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22371">The "'''Norfolk Four'''" are four men, Derek Tice, Danial Williams, Joseph J. Dick Jr., and Eric C. Wilson, who were convicted in 1999 for the 1997 rape and murder of Michelle Moore-Bosko in [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. A federal judge ruled in 2016 that the four men, who were convicted based on a [[false confession]], were [[Actual innocence|actually innocent]].&lt;ref name="JackmanVozzella"&gt;Tom Jackman &amp; Laura Vozzella, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2017/03/21/norfolk-4-wrongly-convicted-of-rape-and-murder-pardoned-by-gov-mcauliffe/ 'Norfolk 4,' wrongly convicted of rape and murder, pardoned by Gov. McAuliffe], ''Washington Post'' (March 21, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The convictions of the Norfolk Four were controversial, as their convictions were largely based on confessions which the men and their supporters maintained were [[False confession|coerced]] with threats of receiving the [[death penalty]] if they did not plead guilty. Organizations such as the [[Innocence Project]] protested the convictions as a [[miscarriage of justice]], while Moore-Bosko's parents continue to believe that all those convicted were participants in the crime.&lt;ref name="Jackman2008"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/14/AR2008121402100.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Clemency Campaign Renews Misery | first=Tom | last=Jackman | date=December 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InnocenceProjectProfile"&gt;{{cite web|title=Norfolk Four (Derek Derek Tice, Danial Williams, Joseph Dick, and Eric Wilson)|url=https://exonerate.org/all-project-list/norfolk-four-derek-tice-danial-williams-joseph-dick-and-eric-wilson/|publisher=Innocence Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the four men, Tice, Williams, and Dick, were sentenced to one or more [[life sentence]]s in prison without the possibility of [[parole]] due to their having either pleaded guilty to or having been convicted of the murder, while Wilson was convicted of rape and sentenced to 8½ years in prison. Three other men, Geoffrey A. Farris, John E. Danser, and Richard D. Pauley, Jr., were also initially charged with the crime, but the charges against them were later dropped. A fifth man, Omar Ballard, was also convicted of the crime and was sentenced to 100 years in prison, 59 of which were suspended. He is the only man whose DNA matches that found at the scene, and his confession states that he committed the crime by himself, with none of the other men involved. Forensic evidence is consistent with his story that there were no other participants.&lt;ref name="Jackman2008"/&gt;

In 2016, U.S. District Judge [[John A. Gibney Jr.]] ruled that "by any measure," the evidence showed that Williams and Dick did not commit the rape and murder to which they pleaded guilty, and that the evidence showed that  "no sane human being" could convict them.&lt;ref name="Richer"&gt;Alanna Durkin Richer, [http://pilotonline.com/news/local/crime/members-of-norfolk-four-convicted-in-rape-murder-are-innocent/article_6f6c5818-1770-5e6b-8b60-b76a5afb05ae.html 2 members of 'Norfolk Four' convicted in 1997 rape, murder are innocent, judge declares], Associated Press (September 26, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Tice's conviction had by that time already been overturned, and the efforts of Wilson to be formally declared innocent were rejected by the courts because he had served his entire sentence.&lt;ref name="Richer"/&gt; On March 21, 2017, the Norfolk Four were granted absolute pardons by Virginia Governor [[Terry McAuliffe]].&lt;ref name="APPardon"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/apnewsbreak-virginia-governor-pardons-norfolk-4-sailors-convicted-in-1997-rape-killing-police-forced-confession/2017/03/21/ca7edf88-0e66-11e7-aa57-2ca1b05c41b8_story.html|title=Virginia governor pardons 'Norfolk 4' sailors convicted in 1997 rape, killing; police forced confession|agency=Associated Press |date=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation ==
On July 8, 1997 Bill Bosko returned home after a military assignment to find his wife Michelle murdered, having been raped, stabbed, and strangled to death.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news|title=What Happened in Norfolk?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/magazine/19Norfolk-t.html?pagewanted=all|magazine=[[New York Times Magazine]]|date=August 19, 2007|first=Alan|last=Berlow}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time it was noted that there were no signs of a break-in or a struggle inside the apartment. As the investigation progressed, detective Robert Glenn Ford questioned residents of Moore-Bosko's development and was informed by Tamika Taylor, a friend of Moore-Bosko's, that another neighbor, Danial Williams, was "obsessed" with the murdered woman.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; Williams lived in an apartment near Bosko's with his wife and their roommate, Joe Dick. Detective Ford interrogated both Williams and Dick and obtained confessions from them but their confessions were inconsistent both with each other and with the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Brian Bennett |title=The Disturbing Case of the Norfolk Four|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1858171,00.html|magazine=Time|date=November 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the confessions, Williams claimed that he acted alone while Dick stated that he and Williams had committed the crime together. Dick also claimed to have committed the crime between the hours of 9 and 11 p.m., which clashed with Taylor's claims that she and Michelle had remained out from noon until 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. as well as naval logs that reportedly showed that Dick was on duty on the {{USS|Saipan|LHA-2}} at the time of the murder.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; The Chief Petty Officer that Dick reported to commented that he had taken special interest in Dick due to what he saw as the man's diminished mental capacity; he believed it to be "virtually impossible for Dick to sneak off, commit the crime and sneak back on board".&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; Both men also claimed to have committed violent attacks or sexual assaults on the victim which were inconsistent with the physical evidence, such as Williams claiming to have beaten Michelle with a shoe and assaulting her to the face three times.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; Instead the coroner's report stated that Michelle had died due to being stabbed and strangled,&lt;ref name="ToobinWrongGuys"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeffrey Toobin|title=The Wrong Guys|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/08/24/the-wrong-guys|magazine=New Yorker|date=August 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; upon which point Williams changed his confession to state that he "may have grabbed Michelle's neck and that he had used a knife he found in the bedroom to kill her." Neither Williams nor Dick could provide an accurate description of the knife.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;

[[DNA evidence]] taken from the scene did not match Williams or Dick, which led a jailhouse informant to prompt Dick to name a co-conspirator. Eric Wilson was then named.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Case Timeline| url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/the-confessions |website=pbs.org |accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA did not match Wilson either and Dick indicated that a fourth man, whom he called "George" but whom he identified from photographs as Derek Tice, was also involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Questions swirl around conviction of 'Norfolk Four'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4XYiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oqwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2161,4722188&amp;dq=norfolk-four+eric-wilson&amp;hl=en|accessdate=25 March 2013|newspaper=The Argus-Press|date=Dec 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tice confessed and implicated three more men in the crime, and insisted that the group had broken into the apartment, which contradicted earlier evidence that showed that the apartment did not appear to have been broken into. Since the DNA evidence did not match Tice, the police got Dick to name three other men as co-conspirators.  These men were ultimately never charged because they had ironclad alibis including one who was internet chatting with his girlfriend at the time of the murder and another who records showed had withdrawn money from a cash machine hundreds of miles away within minutes of when the murder had occurred.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; Critics of the police case also noted that the stab wounds to Moore-Bosko were all of a uniform depth and clustered closely together.  This seemed to contradict the prosecution's assertion that multiple men had taken turns stabbing her, but seemed consistent with a scenario where one assailant stabbed her multiple times.

== Trial ==
Williams, Wilson, and Tice were each brought to trial in 1999, with Williams pleading guilty to rape and capital murder in the hopes of getting a life sentence in exchange for a stipulation of facts.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; Lawyers for the three men mentioned that none of their DNA matched that found at Michelle's apartment, to which prosecutors stated that the lack of DNA evidence couldn't disprove that the defendants weren't at the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells|first=Tom|title=The Wrong Guys: Murder, False Confessions, and the Norfolk Four|year=2008|publisher=New Press|isbn=1-59558-401-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams was found guilty of rape and sentenced to eight and a half years, while Dick received life without parole and Tice received two consecutive life sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knepper|first=Cathy D.|title=Jersey Justice: The Story of the Trenton Six|year=2011|publisher=Rivergate Books|isbn=0-8135-5127-7|pages=210–212|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QQjlkmRXBKwC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=%22Eric+Wilson%22+trial&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1_1PUfC4NKXu0gH89oDIBQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Eric%20Wilson%22%20trial&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Omar Ballard ==
On January 15, 1998, Omar Ballard pleaded guilty to the rape of a fourteen-year-old girl.  In February of the same year, he sent a letter to a female acquaintance threatening her and indicating that he had murdered Michelle Moore Bosko.&lt;ref name="TSoFC"&gt;{{cite book|last=Warden|first=Rob|title=True Stories of False Confessions|year=2009|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=978-0-8101-2603-9 |pages=424–425|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdgUTgyGx5YC&amp;pg=PA424&amp;dq=%22Karen+Stover%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bwJQUceXMaKA0AGS0IGgBA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Karen%20Stover%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later discovered that Ballard was an associate of Michelle Moore Bosko.  Tamika Taylor, who had introduced Ballard to the Boskos and knew about his history of violence towards women, had told the police that they should investigate him as a possible suspect.&lt;ref name="TSoFC"/&gt; Ballard was later investigated for the crime and arrested after it was discovered that his DNA matched that found at the crime scene.&lt;ref name="TSoFC"/&gt;  Ballard confessed to the crime, giving a description that aligned with the physical evidence.  Despite police pressure to implicate Williams, Tice, Dick, and Wilson, Ballard insisted that he had committed the crime alone, saying that "those four who opened their mouths were stupid".&lt;ref name="TSoFC"/&gt; The police incorporated Ballard into their theory of the crime, but insisted that Ballard refused to name his accomplices for fear of being labeled a "snitch" and that the other men, who had been willing to implicate others in the crime, were afraid of Ballard and thus refused to implicate him.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;

== Retrials, appeals, and release ==
Williams appealed his verdict but was denied in 2000.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; Tice's conviction was reversed in 2002 by the [[Virginia Court of Appeals]] because Judge Poston had not allowed Tice's attorney to question Ballard about his written confession.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; During the retrial, Poston refused to allow the confession or statements in as evidence because they were not properly [[Authentication (law)|authenticated]], but the judge did allow Tice's attorney to read the confession letter aloud.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; Despite the retrial, Tice was again sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;

Tice's conviction was overturned on November 27, 2006 by a [[circuit court]] on constitutional grounds, but the conviction was reinstated by the [[Virginia Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url = http://www.thejusticeproject.org/press/releases/virginia-circuit-court-judge.html|title=Virginia Circuit Court Judge Overturns Derek Tice Conviction| date=30 November 2006|publisher =The Justice Project| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070712093802/http://www.thejusticeproject.org/press/releases/virginia-circuit-court-judge.html | archivedate = 12 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tice filed a petition for habeas corpus with a United States District Court, and on September 14, 2009, U.S. District Judge [[Richard Leroy Williams|Richard L. Williams]] vacated Tice's murder and rape convictions, on the ground that Tice had been denied his constitutional right to effective counsel. On November 19, 2009, Judge Williams ruled that prosecutors can retry Tice. On April 20, 2011, the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] affirmed Judge Williams' rulings vacating Tice's convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Virginia: Court Upholds Ruling for Ex-Sailor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/us/21brfs-Virginia.html|newspaper=New York Times|first=Sabrina|last=Tavernise|date=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tice was later freed in 2011 after the Fourth Circuit ruled that Tice's confession should have been thrown out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Gretchen |last=Gavett |title=The Confessions: One of the "Norfolk Four" Cleared of Rape/Murder Charges|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/the-confessions-one-of-the-norfolk-four-cleared-of-rapemurder-charges/|date=4 August 2011|accessdate=19 May 2016|website=pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson was released in 2005 after the conditional pardon (see below), but must register as a sex offender for the rest of his life.  In March 2010, he asked the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]] for a writ of [[habeas corpus]] challenging his conviction.  The court refused to hear Wilson's case, saying that since he was not in prison, on probation, on parole or on supervised release, he was not in custody and therefore could not petition for habeas. The Fourth Circuit also refused to hear the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Wilson v. Flaherty|vol=689 |reporter=F.3d|opinion=332|pinpoint= |court=4th Cir.|date=2012|url=http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/Published/116919.p.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former detective Glenn Ford was later indicted on May 2010 on unrelated extortion charges of accepting payments from criminal suspects in return for favorable treatment,&lt;ref name="McGlone2010"&gt;{{cite news | first = Tim | last = McGlone | title = Norfolk ex-detective accused of taking money from suspects | date = 2010-05-11 | publisher = [[Landmark Media Enterprises]] L.L.C. | url = http://hamptonroads.com/2010/05/norfolk-exdetective-accused-taking-money-suspects?cid=omc | newspaper= [[The Virginian-Pilot]] | accessdate = 2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was found guilty of two of the four counts against him.&lt;ref name="Frontline"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Confessions: Introduction|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/the-confessions/etc/introduction.html|work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]|publisher=PBS|date=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dana Hedgpeth (February 25, 2011) [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/crime-scene/dana-hedgpeth/former-detective-in-norfolk-4.html Prison for 'Norfolk 4' detective], ''[[Washington Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted attorneys for the Norfolk Four to call for full exoneration of their clients and in 2013, [[Yale Law School]]'s Supreme Court Advocacy Clinic filed a petition for the Supreme Court to clear Wilson's record of his crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/06/us/06norfolk.html|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|title=Officer's Extortion Conviction Prompts Calls for Full Exoneration of 'Norfolk Four'|author=Tavernise, Sabrina|date=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Supreme Court Advocacy Clinic Files Petition with High Court Over ''Norfolk Four'' Case|url=https://law.yale.edu/yls-today/news/supreme-court-advocacy-clinic-files-petition-high-court-over-norfolk-four-case|publisher=Yale Law School|date=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia Attorney General [[Ken Cuccinelli]] did not file a response, but the Supreme Court ordered him to file a brief by April 25, 2013.&lt;ref name=NYT4113&gt;{{cite news|title=Out of Prison?

The case is Wilson v. Flaherty, No. 12-986.&lt;ref name = "Wilson v. Flaherty" &gt;{{cite web|title=ERIC C. WILSON, Petitioner, v. W.

In 2016, U.S. District Judge [[John A. Gibney Jr.]] ruled that "by any measure," the evidence showed that Williams and Dick did not commit the rape and murder to which they pleaded guilty, and that the evidence showed that  "no sane human being" could convict them.&lt;ref name="Richer"/&gt; Tice's conviction had by that time already been overturned by that point, and the efforts of Wilson to be formally declared innocent were rejected by the courts because he had served his entire sentence.&lt;ref name="Richer"/&gt;

== Clemency petitions and ultimate pardon in 2017 ==
In 2005 attorneys for Dick, Williams and Tice petitioned for [[clemency]] from Virginia governor [[Mark Warner]]. Warner did not rule on the petition, and it was considered by his successor, Governor [[Tim Kaine]]. The claims of innocence were backed by several FBI agents as well as eleven of the jurors who initially convicted them.&lt;ref name="Urbina2008"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ian|last=Urbina|title=Retired F.B.I.

The jurors stated that they believed the men were not guilty.&lt;ref name="JurorsBackClemency"/&gt;

On March 21, 2017, the Norfolk Four were granted absolute pardons by Virginia Governor [[Terry McAuliffe]].&lt;ref name="APPardon"/&gt; In a statement, a spokesman for the governor said: "These pardons close the final chapter on a grave injustice that has plagued these 4 men for nearly 20 years. While former Governor Kaine had initially granted conditional pardons in the case, more exculpatory information discovered since then and detailed by Judge John Gibney during exhaustive evidentiary proceedings indicate that absolute pardons are appropriate."&lt;ref name="JackmanVozzella"/&gt;

[[File:2010 windowboxes MarlboroughMA 4878255212.jpg|thumb|PVC window boxes will not decay]]
'''Plastic lumber''' ('''PL''') is a [[plastic]] form of [[lumber]] (timber) made of virgin or [[recycling|recycled]] plastic (in which case it can be called '''RPL''').  It is made of 100% plastic, compared with [[Wood-plastic composite|wood-plastic composite lumber]].

Widely employed in outdoor [[Deck (building)|decking]], it is also used for [[molding (decorative)|molding and trim]] and [[garden furniture]] such as park benches.

Resistant to cracking and splitting when appropriately installed, plastic lumber can be molded with or without simulated wood grain details. Even with a wood grain design, PL is still easy to distinguish visually from natural timber: the grains are the same uniform color as the rest of the material.

Manufacturers claim plastic lumber is more environmentally-friendly and requires less maintenance than wood/plastic composites or rot-resistant wood.  Unlike wood-plastic composite lumber, plastic lumber is 100% recyclable after its original intended use.

==Production==
Plastic lumber is composed of virgin or waste plastics including [[high density polyethylene|HDPE]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[Polypropylene|PP]], [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]], [[polystyrene|PS]] and [[Polylactic acid|PLA]]. The powder or pellets are mixed to a dough-like consistency at roughly {{convert|400|F|C}} and then extruded or molded to the desired shape. Additives such as [[plastic colorant|colorant]]s, [[coupling agent]]s, [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizer]]s, [[blowing agent]]s, reinforcing agents, [[foaming agent]]s, and [[lubricant]]s help tailor the end product to the target application. The material is formed into both solid and hollow profiles or into [[injection mold]]ed parts and products.

Resin, regrind, and most of the additives are combined and processed in a pelletizing extruder. The new material pellets are formed in a mold and cooled. Pre-distribution testing can help determine the optimal combination of chemical agents, design, agitation, and other flow aid strategies for the specific material in use. Modern testing facilities are available to evaluate materials and determine the optimal combination of equipment components to assure the highest level of accuracy and reliability. Computerized performance test reports document equipment performance.

==Properties==
Plastic lumber can be molded to meet almost any desired spatial condition, a major advantage over wood. It can also be bent and fixed to form strong arching curves.  Plastic lumber works like wood - it can be shaped using conventional woodworking tools. At the same time, it is waterproof and resists all types of rot and mold, although it is not as rigid as wood and may slightly deform in extremely hot weather. Plastic lumber is not sensitive to staining from a variety of agents. A major selling point of this material is it doesn't need to be painted. It is manufactured in a variety of colors, and is widely available in grays and earth tones.

==Engineering properties==
While the compressive properties of plastic lumber are equal or greater than those of wood, the modulus of elasticity is very low.  Moreover, plastic lumber is subject to far more creep than wood.&lt;ref name="DIANE"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Development and Testing of Plastic Lumber Materials for Construction Applications|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-4289-1323-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use in load-bearing structures requires different considerations from wood.&lt;ref name="DIANE" /&gt;

Plastic lumber can present issues with fire containment: it performed worse than a variety of wood and composite materials in a test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.472.8781&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|work=46th International SAMPE Symposium and Exhibition|location=Long Beach, California|date=May 2001|title=FIRE ISSUES IN ENGINEERED WOOD COMPOSITES FOR NAVAL WATERFRONT FACILITIES|author=L. Javier Malvar, Robert Tichy, David E. Pendleton1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plastic lumber also deforms easily at high temperature, planning for the event of fire needs to take this into account.&lt;ref name="DIANE" /&gt;

==Standards==
ASTM has developed seven standard test methods to measure the properties of PL:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astm.org/SNEWS/DECEMBER_2001/wsd_dec01.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* D 6108, Standard Test Method for Compressive Properties of Plastic Lumber and Shapes;
* D 6109, Standard Test Method for Flexural Properties of Unreinforced and Reinforced Plastic Lumber;
* D 6111, Standard Test Method for Bulk Density and Specific Gravity of Plastic Lumber and Shapes by Displacement;

{{unreferenced|date=July 2010}}
The '''School of Diplomacy''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|縱|横|家}}|s={{linktext|纵|横|家}}|p=Zōng héng Jiā}}), or the '''School of Vertical and Horizontal Alliances''' was a political and diplomatic [[clique]] during the [[Warring States period]] of [[History of China|Chinese history]] (476-220 BCE). According to the ''[[Book of Han]]'', the school was one of the [[Nine Schools of Thought]] ({{zh|t=九流|s=九流|p=Jiŭ Liú}}).

According to the ''[[Han Fei Zi]]'', a contemporary work on [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist Philosophy]], supporters of "Vertical Alliance" encourage the weak multitude to attack the one strong side whilst the Horizontal Alliance promote the one strong side attacking the weak multitude. They are all fickle and capricious, change sides frequently and are unable to decide who their master is. Both [[Su Qin]] of the Vertical Alliance clique and [[Zhang Yi (Warring States period)|Zhang Yi]] of the Horizontal Alliance clique issue many plans and schemes that are politically subjective.'

The origins of the terms "Vertical" and "Horizontal" are geographic and are based on either a North-South axis (i.e. vertical) or an East-West axis (i.e. horizontal). Thus the six states allied on the North-South axis were known as the "Vertical Alliance" whilst those on the East-West axis aligned with the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]] were termed the "Horizontal Alliance".

"Zong" indicates the "He Zong", or Vertical Alliance, the "weak multitude against the one strong side", made up of the six states of [[Qi (state)|Qi]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Yan (state)|Yan]], [[Han (state)|Han]], [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]] and [[Wei (state)|Wei]] united against [[Qin (state)|Qin]]. "Heng" indicates the "Lian Heng", or Horizontal Alliance, the "one strong side to smash the weak multitude", thus illustrating the different diplomatic policies of the two sides.

The School of Diplomacy was one of the nine styles of the ten Schools of Thought of the [[Warring States period]] and starts with an objective point of view to reach the required goal. The school’s adherents were always an active group on the political stage during the [[Warring States period]]. Moreover, they played a decisive role and were described as extremely powerful and capable, constantly struggling to manipulate the situation.

Originated by ''[[Guiguzi]]'', the School of Diplomacy’s main adherents were [[Su Qin]], [[Zhang Yi (strategist)|Zhang Yi]] (Su’s disciple), Gan Mao, Sima Cuo, [[Yue Yi]], Fan Sui, Cai Ze, Zou Ji, Mao Sui, [[Li Yiji]] and Kuai Tong as detailed in the ''[[Zhan Guo Ce|Annals of the Warring States]]''.

The few principal written records of the School of Diplomacy that exist today are the thirteenth chapter of the ''Book of Gui'' or ''[[Guiguzi]]'', the thirty-third chapter of ''[[Zhan Guo Ce|Annals of the Warring States]]'' (not about the School of Diplomacy’s followers but primarily the words and actions of its advisors as well as actual combat case studies), the thirty-first chapter of ''Su Zi'' and the tenth chapter of ''Zhang Zi''. The seventh chapter of the "Benjing Yifu" appendix to the ''[[Guiguzi]]'' describes the mental and moral cultivation methods used by the School of Diplomacy; the "Benjing" covers the ideas behind the basic guiding principles whilst the "Yinfu" consists of very mysterious concealed writings. The reader can comprehend these but is unable to discover their essential meaning. &lt;!--所谓悠然心会妙处难与君说是也 not translated as I cannot determine the meaning --&gt; The ''[[Guiguzi]]'' is a book of theory that is complete in every detail and very subtly written, making its ideas hard to express. More importantly the work requires study and use in order to understand the nuances of its meaning. The ''[[Zhan Guo Ce|Annals of the Warring States]]'' is a well-written rhetorical compendium the words and actions of the strategists of the School of Diplomacy who were all resourceful, intelligent, aware of the actual situation and gifted in the use of language.

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flynn and Giraldez|title=Born with a "Silver Spoon": The Origin of World Trade in 1571}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The '''Single Whip Law''' or the "Single Whip Reform" ({{zh|t=一條鞭法|s=一条鞭法|p=Yi Tiao Bian Fa}}) was a fiscal law first instituted during the middle [[Ming dynasty]], in the early 16th century, and then promulgated throughout the empire in 1580 by [[Zhang Juzheng]].

The measure aimed primarily to simplify the complex fiscal code under Ming law, by commuting most obligations towards the central government - from land and poll taxes to the labour obligations of the peasantry and the tributes of prefectural and county officials - into a single silver payment, at a level based on the population and cultivated land in each prefecture. Therefore, by reducing complexity, the Single Whip law reduced the costs of tax collection, while also increasing the tax base.

The unit of tax collection was changed from rice to silver, which led to an increase in the import of silver into [[China]] from Spain-controlled [[Americas|America]] and [[Japan]]. Because of the sheer amount of silver being imported into China, inflation occurred until the silver taxpaying system was no longer sustainable. The Single Whip Law led, in the long term, to the overthrow of the [[Ming dynasty]], but it also increased European trade in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pfeffer|first=Richard|title=Understanding Business Contracts in China: 1949 - 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10489">'''Strategic sustainable investing''' ('''SSI''') is an [[investment strategy]] that recognizes and rewards leading companies that are moving society towards [[sustainability]]. SSI relies on a consensus-based scientific definition of [[sustainability]], and the assumption that ‘''[[Backcasting]] from Principles of Sustainability''’,&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, J and Robèrt, K-H “Backcasting from non-overlapping sustainability principles – a framework for strategic planning”, International .Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology, 7:1–18. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; whereby a vision of a sustainable future is set as the reference point for developing strategic actions, is the preferred approach to strategically move a company towards sustainability. It was developed by researchers at the [[Blekinge Institute of Technology]] in Sweden.

==The strategic sustainable investment system==
SSI outlines that the financial investment will offer a competitive risk-adjusted return, while providing investment capital to companies that are actively attempting to become more sustainable. It implies lower exposure to sustainability-related risks and it considers financial metrics together with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects, as well as strategy analyses to educate investment decision-making.&lt;ref name="SSI"&gt;[http://www.bth.se/fou/cuppsats.nsf/535439ccd73cc824c1256608004f0529/a6dcb300241ca812c125746000500631!OpenDocument Blandford, Nick, Timothy Nash and André Winter “Strategic Sustainable Investing: Recognizing Value in Transitional Leadership.” Master's thesis, Blekinge Institute of Technology, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristics of SSI:&lt;br /&gt;
•	Lower sustainability risk exposure &lt;br /&gt;
•	A definition of sustainability based on scientific consensus&lt;ref name= "tools and concepts"&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VFX-44KVV9J-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=214b19c668891d8b85307af38cb9017c Robèrt, K.-H. “Tools and concepts for sustainable development, how do they relate to a framework for sustainable development, and to each other?” Journal of Cleaner Production 8: 243–254. 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
•	Primarily driven by movement towards sustainability&lt;br /&gt;
•	Considers financial, ESG, and strategy analysis

SSI operates by prioritizing investment capital allocation to companies that are taking the lead in shifting away from unsustainable behaviour towards new ways of doing business. This capital allocation will provide an incentive for companies to move forward in a sustainable direction. This movement is reported in [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) and other extra-financial reports, but is also recorded in traditional areas of a firm’s financial [[balance sheets]].

By incorporating sustainability investment and returns into traditional financial reporting, a clearer picture of the bottom-line impact of a company’s actions towards sustainability is made available. In this positive reinforcing loop, greater investor returns and [http://plilend.com/ increased movement towards sustainability] are generated with every cycle.

[[Image:Economic analysis chart of movement towards sustainability.jpg|350px]]&lt;br /&gt;''[[Causal loop diagram]] illustrating the strategic sustainable investment''&lt;ref name="SSI"/&gt;

[[Institutional investor]]s, such as mutual and pension funds, take a longer-term position on investments and are thus ideally suited to incorporate SSI strategies.

==Theory background==
The theoretical foundation of SSI is strongly linked to ''strategic sustainable development'', made popular by [[The Natural Step]] and its founder Dr. [[Karl-Henrik Robèrt]].

This strategy resembles [[socially responsible investing]] (SRI), a growing practice amongst ethical investors. Nevertheless, SSI recognizes the gaps&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.responsibleinvesting.org/database/dokuman/SRI%20Report%2010-04_word.pdf Hawken, P. “How the SRI industry has failed to respond to people who want to invest with conscience and what can be done to change it.” Natural Capital Institute. 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; of SRI pointed by several academics and practitioners and presents some alternatives.

==SSI analysis tool==
In order to evolve current SRI and traditional investment practices into Strategic Sustainable Investment, two gaps must be considered:

a.	The recognition of companies with true leading strategies for a sustainable future&lt;br /&gt;
b.	A robust and well defined link must be made between movement towards sustainability and higher investment returns

The SSI analysis tool addresses the first gap by measuring a company’s strategy for addressing sustainability. It allows investors to recognize which companies are leading the transition in a new direction, and which are most likely to be strong performers in tomorrow’s market.

This tool is divided in two main parts: the emerging sustainability issue (esi) chart and the strategy analysis component:

===ESI chart===
[[Image:ESI Chart.jpg|right|thumb|250px|ESI Chart Sample&lt;ref name="SSI"/&gt;]]
The Sectoral Emerging Sustainability Issue (ESI) chart is used to identify which aspects of a determined market sector will become a socio-environmental problem. In the common sense, an issue is called ‘emergent’ when it gets media exposure. Instead, the Tool relies on scientific [[The_Natural_Step#System_conditions_of_sustainability|Principles of sustainability]]&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, J., and K.-H. Robèrt “The Rationale behind the System Conditions”. Department of Physical Resource Theory, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, J., K-H. Robèrt, and K-E. Eriksson “Socio-ecological principles for sustainability”. Getting down to earth — Practical applications of ecological economics. Washington, DC: Island Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; to identify what is emergent.

It exposes which Sustainability Issues present high risks for companies within that sector in the short-term; as well as which Issues will be emerging in the medium and long-terms. Due to differences within a sector, the Sectoral ESI Chart should be made as specific as needed, being flexible to account for various geographical locations and sub-sector subtleties.

The process of composing an ESI chart follows:

Once a sector is selected for an ESI analysis, a list of relevant sustainability issues is assembled. This baseline analysis will result in a list of issues outlining the subject sector’s strengths and concerns that impact society and the environment. Next, prioritization colours are assigned to each sustainability issue: red for very high priority; orange for high priority; yellow for medium priority, and green for low priority according to its assessment in each of three categories: urgency, severity, and systematic contribution.

''Urgency'' assesses the time frame pressing each Issue. The ''severity'' assesses the seriousness of the Issue, in terms of its potential consequences for the environment, society, and companies within that sector. The ''systematic contribution'' is used to gauge the sector’s contribution to the overall Issue.

[[Image:ESI WF.jpg|none|350px]]&lt;br /&gt;''To fill out the Chart, Researchers follow this process flow.''&lt;ref name="SSI"/&gt;

===Strategy analysis component===
====Strategic plan====
The Strategic Plan element assesses the subject company’s planned goals in relation to the emerging sustainability issue (ESI). The qualitative description includes, but is not limited to, information regarding:  public commitments planned operational and business initiatives, political action/ lobbying, and third party partnerships (with NGOs, consultative firms etc.). There is also a comment on the subject company’s core business in relation to the ESI; as this will assist in determining the subject company’s exposure to the emerging risk.

====Strategic actions====
The strategic actions element looks at assessing the subject company’s recent actions taken in relation to the emerging sustainability issue (ESI), thus determining whether the subject company is ‘walking the talk’ in comparison to the vision and goals outlined.
The subject company’s actions are seen through the lens of [[strategic sustainable development]], and thus three questions are emphasized as a mental guideline:

a.	Does this action provide a competitive return on investment (ROI)?&lt;br /&gt;
b.	Is this action taking the subject company in the right direction?&lt;br /&gt;
c.	Is this action a versatile platform?

====Strategy analysis graph====
The strategy analysis graph shows the subject company’s planned path for dealing with the ESI, tangible progress made, and if existent, government regulations. The trajectory of the subject company’s planned path reveals the extent of their future risk exposure. This graph is placed in the center of the strategy analysis page.

[[Image:Strategy Analysis Graph.jpg|none|thumb|300px|Sample of strategy analysis graph&lt;ref name="SSI"/&gt;]]

====Assurance assessment====
The assurance assessment provides an overall impression of the validity of the information gathered. This assessment may be applied if the data is verified by an external third party, or if discrepancy is evident between different sources of information used on the report.

{{Politics of Sweden}}

The '''1810 Act of Succession''' ({{lang-sv|1810 års successionsordning}}; in English literally ''The 1810 [[order of succession]]'') is one of four ''Fundamental Laws of the Realm'' ({{lang-sv|rikets grundlagar}}) and thus forms part of the [[Constitution of Sweden|Swedish Constitution]]. The Act regulates the [[Line of succession to the Swedish throne|line of succession]] to the [[Monarchy of Sweden|Swedish Throne]] and the conditions which eligible members of the [[Swedish Royal Family]] must abide by in order to remain in it. 

It was jointly adopted by the [[Riksdag of the Estates]], convened in [[Örebro]] on 26 September 1810, and [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]], as a logical consequence following the election on 21 August of [[Jean Baptiste Bernadotte]] as [[Crown Prince of Sweden|Crown Prince]]. 

The actual contents of the Act, save the solemn [[preamble]], has been thoroughly rewritten over the years: the most notable change occurred in 1980 when the core principle of [[agnatic primogeniture]] (male succession only) was changed in favor of [[absolute primogeniture]] (eldest child regardless of sex). 

==Historical background==
The Act of Succession was adopted by the [[Riksdag of the Estates]] assembled at [[Örebro]] in 1810, upon electing [[Charles XIV of Sweden|Charles XIV John]] (Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte) as the heir to King [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]]. This happened at a tumultuous time for Sweden, as only one year earlier the former king, [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav IV Adolf]] (and his sons) had been deposed and replaced by his childless uncle, Charles XIII. At the same time the [[Finnish War]] was coming to an end and [[Finland]], then a part of [[Sweden proper]], was held by [[Imperial Russia|Russia]]. The [[Instrument of Government (1772)|authoritarian constitution of 1772]] was abolished and power was returned to parliament by the new [[Instrument of Government (1809)|Instrument of Government]] adopted on June 6, 1809. From 1814 to 1905 the Act of Succession also regulated succession to the [[Norway|Norwegian]] throne, due to the union of [[Union between Sweden and Norway|Sweden-Norway]].

==Provisions==
The Act in the current version specifies that:
* Only children born in wedlock may inherit the Throne.
* Only the descendants of [[Carl XVI Gustaf]] may inherit the Throne.
* A prince or princess in the line of succession shall belong to and profess the "pure evangelical faith", as defined in the ''[[Augsburg Confession|Unaltered Augsburg Confession]]'' and the ''Uppsala Meeting of 1591'', i.e. by implication the [[Church of Sweden]].
* The offspring of an approved marriage must be brought up within [[Sweden]].
* A prince or princess may not marry and remain in the line of succession without having received consent, upon application of the Monarch, from the [[Government of Sweden]].
* A prince or princess is also prevented from becoming monarch of another country, either by election or marriage, without the consent of the Monarch and the Government.
If any of these provisions are violated: all rights of succession for the person concerned and all descendants are lost.

==Changes==
In its original version, the Act mandated that a Swedish prince could only marry into families deemed to be of [[royal intermarriage|equal rank]], or forfeit for himself and his future descendants all [[Dynasty#Dynasts|dynastic]] rights. The key wording was "private man's daughter" ({{lang-sv|enskild mans dotter}}), a term which in Swedish jurisprudence was understood to include all non-royal persons, including the aristocracy. In 1938 the statutory provision which required a spouse of royal birth was changed and the prohibition only extended to a "private Swedish man's daughter" ({{lang-sv|enskild svensk mans dotter}}). 

A total of five Swedish princes lost their rights of succession due to violation of that provision: [[Prince Oscar Bernadotte|Oscar]] in 1888, [[Lennart Bernadotte|Lennart]] in 1932, [[Sigvard Bernadotte|Sigvard]] in 1934, [[Prince Carl Bernadotte|Carl]] in 1937 and [[Carl Johan Bernadotte|Carl Johan]] in 1946. There is since 1980 no statutory limitation, based on either nationality or royal rank, on whom a prince or princess can marry, apart from the fact that permission must be granted.

In 1980, the rule of succession was changed from [[agnatic primogeniture]] to [[absolute primogeniture]]. This change in effect created [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden|Victoria]] (born 1977) [[heir apparent]], passing over her younger brother [[Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland|Prince Carl Philip]] (born 1979).

{{Ancien Régime}}
{{refimprove|date=September 2007}}
The '''taille''' ({{IPA-fr|taj}}) was a direct land [[tax]] on the [[France|French]] [[peasant]]ry and non-nobles in ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' France. The tax was imposed on each household and was based on how much land it held.

==History==
Originally only an "exceptional" tax (i.e. imposed and collected in times of need, as the king was expected to survive on the revenues of the "[[Crown lands of France|domaine royal]]", or lands that belonged to him directly), the taille became permanent in 1439, when the right to collect taxes in support of a standing army was granted to [[Charles VII of France]] during the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Unlike modern income taxes, the total amount of the taille was first set (after the [[French States-General|Estates General]] was suspended in 1484) by the French king from year to year, and this amount was then apportioned among the various provinces for collection.

Exempted from the tax were clergy and nobles (except for non-noble lands they held in "pays d'état" [see below]), officers of the crown, military personnel, magistrates, university professors and students, and franchises (''villes franches'') such as Paris.

The provinces were of three sorts, the ''[[pays d'élection]]'', the ''[[pays d'état]]'' and the ''pays d'imposition''.  In the ''pays d'élection'' (the longest held possessions of the French crown; some of these provinces had had the equivalent autonomy of a ''pays d'état'' in an earlier period, but had lost it through the effects of royal reforms) the assessment and collection of taxes were entrusted to elected officials (at least originally; later, these positions were bought), and the tax was generally "personal", meaning it was attached to non-noble individuals.  In the ''pays d'état'' ("provinces with provincial estates" [[Brittany]], [[Languedoc]], [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], [[Béarn]], [[Dauphiné]], [[Provence]], and such portions of [[Gascony]] as [[Bigorre]], [[Comminges]], and the [[Quatre-Vallées]]; these recently acquired provinces had been able to maintain a certain local autonomy in terms of taxation), the assessment of the tax was established by local councils and the tax was generally "[[Real property|real]]", meaning that it was attached to non-noble lands (that is, even nobles possessing such lands were required to pay taxes on them).  Finally, ''pays d'imposition'' were recently conquered lands which had their own local historical institutions (they were similar to the ''pays d'état'' under which they are sometimes grouped), although taxation was overseen by the royal [[intendant]].

In an attempt to reform the fiscal system, new administrative divisions were created in the 16th century. The ''Recettes générales'', commonly known as ''[[généralité]]s'' and overseen in the beginning by ''receveurs généraux'' or ''généraux conseillers'' (royal tax collectors), were initially only taxation districts.  Their role steadily increased and by the mid 17th century, the généralités were under the authority of an ''[[intendant]]'', and they became a vehicle for the expansion of royal power in matters of justice, taxation, and policing.  By the outbreak of the Revolution, there were 36 généralités; the last two were created as recently as 1784.

[[Image:Généralités in 1789.jpeg|thumb|right|300px|''[[Généralité]]s'' of France in 1789.  Areas in red are ''pays d'état''; in white, ''pays d'élection''; in yellow, ''pays d'imposition''.]]

Until the late 17th century, tax collectors were called ''receveurs royaux''.  In 1680, the system of the ''[[Ferme Générale]]'' was established, a franchised customs and excise operation in which individuals bought the right to collect the taille on behalf of the king, through six-year adjudications (some taxes, including the ''aides'' and the ''gabelle'', had been farmed out in this way as early as 1604).  The major tax collectors in that system were known as the ''fermiers généraux'' ("farmers-general", in English).

== Collection ==

Efficient tax collection was one of the major causes for French administrative and royal centralization in the [[Early Modern period]]. The taille became a major source of royal income (roughly half in the 1570s), the most important direct tax of pre-[[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] France, and provided for the growing cost of warfare in the 15th and 16th centuries.  Records show the taille increasing from 2.5 million [[French livre|livre]]s in 1515 to six million after 1551; in 1589 the taille reached a record 21 million livres, before dropping.

The taille was only one of a number of taxes. There also existed the "taillon" (a tax for military expenditures), a national salt tax (the [[gabelle]]), national tariffs (the "aides") on various products (including wine), local tariffs on speciality products (the "douane") or levied on products entering the city (the "octroi") or sold at fairs, and local taxes. Finally, the church benefited from a mandatory tax or tithe called the "dîme".

[[Louis XIV of France]] created several additional tax systems, including the "capitation" (begun in 1695) which touched every person including nobles and the clergy (although exemption could be bought for a large one-time sum) and the "dixième" (1710–1717, restarted in 1733), which was a true tax on income and on property value and was meant to support the military.

In 1749, under [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], a new tax based on the "dixième", the "vingtième" (or "one-twentieth"), was enacted to reduce the royal deficit, and this tax continued through the ancien régime. This tax was based solely on revenues (5% of net earnings from land, property, commerce, industry and from official offices), and was meant to reach all citizens regardless of status, but the clergy, the regions with "pays d'état" and the parlements protested; the clergy won exemption, the "pays d'état" won reduced rates, and the parlements halted new income statements, effectively making the "vingtième" a far less efficient tax than it was designed to be. The financial needs of the [[Seven Years' War]] led to a second (1756–1780), and then a third (1760–1763) "vingtième" being created. In 1754 the "vingtième" produced 11.7 million livres.

The ''taille'' was used very heavily by the French to fund their many wars like the [[Hundred Years' War]] and the [[Thirty Years' War]].{{citation needed|date = June 2012}}  It eventually became one of the most hated taxes of the ''Ancien Régime''.&lt;ref&gt;https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Alexis_de_Tocqueville_-_L%27Ancien_R%C3%A9gime_et_la_R%C3%A9volution,_L%C3%A9vy,_1866.djvu/171&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tipton Three''' is the collective name given to three British citizens from [[Tipton]], England, who were held in [[extrajudicial detention]] by the [[United States government]] for two years in [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp]] in Cuba.&lt;ref name=SFChronicle060702&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/07/02/INGJNJMQF51.DTL |first=Jonathan |last=Curiel |title=All eyes on Guantanamo: Movie, court ruling intensify focus on military prisons |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=2 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ruhal Ahmed]] was born on 11 March 1981; [[Asif Iqbal (Guantanamo detainee 87)|Asif Iqbal]] was born on 24 April 1981; the [[United States Department of Defense]] estimated that [[Shafiq Rasul]] was born in 1977.&lt;ref name=DoDList2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/May2006/d20060515%20List.pdf |title=List of Individuals Detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba from January 2002 through May 15, 2006 |work=[[US Department of Defense]] |date=15 May 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130123509/http://www.defenselink.mil/news/May2006/d20060515%20List.pdf |archivedate=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports state he was only a couple of years older than his friends. The three men in their early 20s were captured in Afghanistan in 2001, transferred to United States Army custody and transported to Guantanamo, where they were detained as [[enemy combatants]]. Their families were not told of their whereabouts until the [[British Foreign Office]] informed them in January 2002. They were three of nine Britons detained at Guantanamo.

After negotiations between the governments and British assessment of their interrogations, the men were repatriated to the United Kingdom in March 2004. They were released without charge the next day.

With many others, Shafiq Rasul filed a ''[[habeas corpus]]'' suit in 2004 against the United States government for his detention, in a case that ultimately went to the [[US Supreme Court]]. In the landmark, ''[[Rasul v. Bush]]'' (2004), the court held that [[Guantanamo detainees]] have the right to challenge whether their detention is constitutional in the US courts. The three men were [[Guantanamo Bay attorneys|represented]] in the UK by the lawyer [[Gareth Peirce]].&lt;ref name=DemocracyNow20050201&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Tipton Three and [[Jamal Udeen Al-Harith]] filed a suit in 2004 against the US government in ''[[Rasul v. Rumsfeld]]'', challenging its use of torture and religious abuses of detainees. This case was dismissed in April 2009 by the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, based on "limited immunity" of government officials; the court ruled that such treatment had not been legally defined at the time as prohibited. In December 2009 the US Supreme Court declined to accept the case for hearing, so the lower court ruling stands.

The three men were featured as the subjects of ''[[The Road to Guantánamo]]'' (2006), a [[docu-drama]] about the events directed by the British filmmaker, [[Michael Winterbottom]].

==The three==
The three travelled together, were captured together, and were released together on 9 March 2004, along with two other detainees.

Iqbal married on 2 July 2005.

==Abuse claims==
{{See also|Detainee abuse}}
On 4 August 2004 Iqbal, Ahmed and Rasul released a report on their [[abuse]] and [[humiliation]] while in US custody.&lt;ref name="DoDList2"/&gt; In it, according to the [[BBC]], the three describe significant abuse, including:
* They were repeatedly punched, kicked, slapped, forcibly injected with drugs, [[deprived of sleep]], hooded, photographed naked, and subjected to body cavity searches, and sexual and religious humiliations.
* The American guard told the inmates: "The world does not know you're here. We would kill you and no one would know".
* Iqbal said when he arrived at Guantanamo, one of the soldiers told him: "You killed my family in the towers and now it's time to get back at you".
* Rasul said an [[MI5]] officer had told him during an interrogation that he would be detained in Guantanamo for life.
* The men said they saw the beating of mentally ill inmates.
* Another man was left brain damaged after a beating by soldiers as punishment for attempting suicide.
* The Britons said an inmate told them he was shown a video of hooded men- apparently inmates- being forced to sodomise one another.
* Guards threw prisoners' [[Qur'an]]s into toilets and tried to force them to give up their religion.

After the appointment of General [[Geoffrey Miller (general)|Geoffrey Miller]] as commander of the camp, they said treatment became more harsh, including short shackling and the forced shaving-off of beards.

In the report, they allege that those who represented themselves as being from [[MI5]], or the [[British Foreign Office]], seemed unconcerned with their welfare.

In the end, the three falsely confessed (under force and abusive interrogation) to being the three previously unidentified faces in an alleged video that showed a meeting between [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Mohamed Atta]]. But MI5 produced evidence demonstrating they were in England at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/aug/04/afghanistan.usa | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | location=London | title=Afghanistan to Guantánamo Bay – the story of three British detainees | first=Tania | last=Branigan | date=4 August 2004 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media events==

===Lie Lab===
In May 2007, Ruhal Ahmed and Shafiq Rasul agreed to appear on the [[Channel 4]] reality show ''Lie Lab''. The technology used on the show was developed by Professor Sean Spence from the [[University of Sheffield]]. It uses [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) to look at the activity in the brain's [[pre-frontal cortex]] to view how a subject reacts to questioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/science/microsites/L/lie_lab/detection_1.html |title=Lie Lab |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527014620/http://www.channel4.com/science/microsites/L/lie_lab/detection_1.html |archivedate=27 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SciAm"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=new-lie-detector |first=Gary |last=Stix |title=Can fMRI Really Tell If You're Lying? |journal=[[Scientific American]] |date=13 August 2008 |accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the test have included neuroscientists and legal scholars, who have said the technique is unlikely to accurately measure truth-telling, as there are too many variables affecting results. They think the technique may be useful for additional research.&lt;ref name="SciAm"/&gt;

Although he earlier said that he had entered Afghanistan to do charity work, on the program, Ahmed said he had visited an Islamist training camp, where he handled weapons and learned how to use an [[AK47]]. Rasul refused to go through the test.&lt;ref name="LieLab"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,,2094030,00.html |first=Andrew |last=Anthony |title=On Television: "Sisters are doing it for themselves |newspaper=[[The Observer]] |date=3 June 2007 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BBC Five Live interview===
In January 2010, Ruhal Ahmed and Shafiq Rasul were interviewed on ''Five Live''. They both said they had visited a Taliban training camp, but it was because they were trapped in the province. They had wanted to find out "what was happening", and the Taliban was the only government operating at the time. The interviewer Victoria observed that Ahmed had said he had handled AK47 guns.

Shafiq Rasul said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Being in Afghanistan, we were at that age where… seeing a gun… you'd never seen a gun in the UK… you want to hold it. You want to see what its like. But we were never there to do any training. That's what, that's what, we were just there. We held it to see what it was like. That's how we've explained it. But it has been taken out of context, saying that 'Oh, these guys from the UK, they were at that age, 9/11 had just happened, and they were there for terrorist training'. But, but – that's not the case. That's not what happened&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Treaty of Chaguaramas''' established the [[Caribbean Community and Common Market]], later known as [[CARICOM]]. It was signed on July 4, 1973 in [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad and Tobago|Chaguaramas]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caricomlaw.org/doc.php?id=21 Treaty of Chaguaramas (1973)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011055645/http://www.caricomlaw.org/doc.php?id=21 |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed by [[Barbados]], [[Guyana]], [[Jamaica]], and [[Dominion of Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad and Tobago]]. It came into effect on 1 August 1973. The treaty also established the Caribbean Community including the [[Caribbean Single Market and Economy]], replacing the [[Caribbean Free Trade Association]] which ceased to exist on 1 May 1974.

In addition to economic issues, the Community instrument addressed issues of [[foreign policy]] coordination and functional cooperation. Issues of [[economic integration]], particularly those related to trade arrangements, were addressed in the CSME Annex.

A revised Treaty of Chaguaramas establishing the Caribbean Community including the [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy]] (CSME) was signed in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caricomlaw.org/doc.php?id=131 Treaty of Chaguaramas (2001)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007110837/http://www.caricomlaw.org/doc.php?id=131 |date=2007-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oath==
{{Politics of the Caribbean Community}}
{{cleanup|reason=treaty preamble is copied, instead of providing summary|date=November 2017}}
The countries of the region that signed the Treaty of Chaguaramas made an oath to:

*'''Recall''' the Declaration of Grand Anse and other decisions of the Conference of Heads of Government, in particular the commitment to deepening regional economic integration through the establishment of the CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME) in order to achieve sustained economic development based on international competitiveness, coordinated economic and foreign policies, functional co-operation and enhanced trade and economic relations with third States;
*'''Recognising''' that [[globalisation]] and [[liberalisation]] have important implications for international competitiveness;
*'''Determined''' to enhance the effectiveness of the decision-making and implementation processes of the Community;
*'''Desirous''' of restructuring the Organs and Institutions of the Caribbean Community and Common Market and redefining their functional relationships so as to enhance the participation of their peoples, and in particular the social partners, in the integration movement;
*'''Conscious''' of the need to promote in the Community the highest level of efficiency in the production of goods and services especially with a view to maximizing [[foreign exchange reserves|foreign exchange]] earnings on the basis of international competitiveness, attaining [[food security]], achieving structural [[:wikt:diversification|diversification]] and improving the [[standard of living]] of their peoples;
*'''Aware''' that optimal production by economic enterprises in the Community requires the structured integration of production in the Region, and particularly, the unrestricted movement of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], [[Labour (economics)|labour]] and technology;
*'''Resolved''' to establish conditions which would facilitate access by their nationals to the collective resources of the Region on a non-discriminatory basis;
*'''Convinced''' that market-driven industrial development in the production of goods and services is essential for the economic and social development of the peoples of the Community;
*'''Cognisant''' that a fully integrated and liberalised internal market will create favourable conditions for sustained, market-led production of goods and services on an internationally competitive basis;
*'''Desirous further''' of establishing and maintaining a sound and stable macro-economic environment that is conducive to investment, including cross-border investments, and the competitive production of goods and services in the Community;
*'''Believing''' that differences in resource endowment and in the levels of [[economic development]] of Member States, may affect the implementation of the Community Industrial Policy;
*'''Recognising also''' the potential of micro, small, and medium enterprise development to contribute to the expansion and viability of national economies of the Community and the importance of large enterprises for achieving [[economies of scale]] in the production process;
*'''Mindful''' that co-operation and joint action in developing trade relations with third States and in establishing appropriate regulatory and administrative procedures and services are essential for the development of the international and intraregional trade of Member States;
*'''Determined further''' to effect a fundamental transformation of the [[agricultural]] sector of the Community by diversifying agricultural production, intensifying [[agro-industrial]] development, expanding [[agri-business]], strengthening the linkages between the agricultural sector and other sectors of the CSME and generally conducting agricultural production on a market-oriented, internationally competitive and environmentally sound basis;
*'''Acknowledging''' the vital importance of land, air and maritime transportation for maintaining economic, social and cultural linkages as well as facilitating emergency assistance among the Member States of the Community;
*'''Recognising further''' the importance of the establishment and structured development of transport links with third States for the accelerated and sustained development of the CSME;
*'''Conscious''' also of the importance of promoting adequate air and maritime transport services for the continued viability of the tourism industry and of reducing the vulnerability of the CARICOM Region resulting from its reliance on extra-regional carriers;
*'''Convinced''' also that a viable transport policy for the Community will make a significant contribution in satisfying the demands for the intra-regional movement of people and products in the CSME;
*'''Acknowledging further''' that some Member States, particularly the [[Less Developed Countries]], are entering the CSME at a disadvantage by reason of the size, structure and vulnerability of their economies; and
*'''Believing further''' that the persistence of disadvantage, however arising, may impact adversely on the economic and social cohesion in the Community;
*'''Conscious further''' that disadvantaged countries, regions and sectors will require a transitional period to facilitate adjustment to competition in the CSME;
*'''Committed''' to establish effective measures, programs and mechanisms to assist disadvantaged countries, regions and sectors of the Community;
*'''Mindful further''' that the benefits expected from the establishment of the CSME are not frustrated by anti-competitive business conduct whose object or effect is to prevent, restrict, or distort competition;
*'''Convinced further''' that the application and convergence of national competition policies and the cooperation of competition authorities in the Community will promote the objectives of the CSME;
*'''Affirming''' that the employment of internationally accepted modes of disputes settlement in the Community will facilitate achievement of the objectives of the Treaty;

The '''Tulane Corporate Law Institute''' is an annual two-day [[M&amp;A]] and [[corporate law]] conference that takes place in [[New Orleans Central Business District|downtown New Orleans]] every spring.  It attracts the most high-profile lawyers and bankers from around the United States, as well as judges, journalists, and others who follow the dealmaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==History==
In the late 1980s, [[Delaware Supreme Court]] Justice Andrew G.T. Moore (author of ''[[Smith v. Van Gorkom]]'' and ''[[Revlon v. MacAndrews]]'') and a group of New Orleans corporate practitioners were among those who undertook an aggressive goal: to establish a new annual platform for a gathering of the nation's
leading corporate jurists and practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.tulane.edu/uploadedFiles/Life_After_Law_School/CLE/PDFs_for_Events_and_Conferences/CLI-BROCHURE-WEB.pdf | title=20th Annual Tulane Corporate Law Institute Brochure|year=2008|publisher= Tulane}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than 20 years later, the Tulane Corporate Law Institute remains a critical meeting place for national leaders in the fields of law and business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The '''Windhoek Declaration for the Development of a Free, Independent and Pluralistic Press''', short: '''Windhoek Declaration''' is a statement of [[press freedom]] principles by [[Africa]]n newspaper journalists in 1991. The Declaration was produced at a [[UNESCO]] seminar, "Promoting an Independent and Pluralistic African Press," held in [[Windhoek]], the capital of [[Namibia]], from 29 April to 3 May 1991.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title="Why the World Became concerned with Journalistic Safety", The Assault on Journalism|last=Berger|first=Guy|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-91-87957-50-5|location=|pages=33-43}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The date of the Declaration's adoption, May 3, has subsequently been declared as [[World Press Freedom Day]]. The document has been viewed as widely influential, as the first in a series of such declarations around the world, and as a crucial affirmation of the international community's commitment to freedom of the press. Subsequently several similar documents were drafted in other parts of the developing world: The [[Alma-Ata]] Declaration for central Asia, [[Sana'a]] Declaration for the Middle East, and the [[Santiago]] Declaration for Latin America and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== A New Communication Strategy ==
Since it was formally approved by the UNESCO Member States during the 28th Session of the General Conference (November 1995)&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO General Conference, 28th Session, [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0010/001018/101803E.pdf Resolution 28 C/4.6]&lt;/ref&gt;, the Windhoek Declaration has become a major reference in the United Nations system. It is part of the New Communication Strategy decided by UNESCO’s General Conference during its 25th Session in November 1989, at the same time as the fall of the Berlin Wall.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO General Conference, 28th Session, [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000846/084696E.pdf Resolution 25/ C 104]&lt;/ref&gt; This new strategy ''de facto'' distanced itself from the [[New World Information and Communication Order]] (NWICO) which was subject to controversies within the Organization in the 1980s. These controversies have divided UNESCO and caused the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] to withdraw from the Organisation (in 1984 and 1985). The NWICO was also subject to oppositions from several professional media organizations, which saw in the New Order a means allowing states to control the media with the justification, among others, to encourage wider and better balanced dissemination of information between North and South.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=La diplomatie des mains vides (Partie III, La diplomatie par procuration, l’Afrique en première ligne)|last=Modoux|first=Alain|publisher=Editions universitaires européennes|year=2018|isbn=978-620-2-27496-8|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1989 New Communication Strategy stresses that this can only be reached “without any obstacle to [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]]” in accordance with the fundamental purpose of UNESCO to promote the “free flow of ideas by word and image”.&lt;ref&gt;Article 1 of UNESCO's Constitution, available at: http://www.unesco.org/education/pdf/UNESCO_E.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/education/pdf/UNESCO_F.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media in Africa: 20 years after the Windhoek Declaration on Press Freedom|last=Berger|first=Guy|publisher=Windhoek: Media Institute of Southern Africa|year=2011|isbn=|location=http://genderlinks.org.za/wp-content/uploads/imported/articles/attachments/14393_mia.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Genesis of the Windhoek seminar ==
The Windhoek seminar was a direct follow-up to the East-West Roundtable that the [[Director general|Director General]], [[Federico Mayor Zaragoza|Federico Mayor]] had rapidly set up in February 1990, a few weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall, in order to address one of the numerous challenges generated by the end of the [[Cold War]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, that is the democratization of the media landscape in Central and Oriental European countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sixty independent journalists from the Soviet Block but also journalists from [[Europe]] and [[North America]] had participated in the Roundtable. Unlike the Windhoek seminar, the East-West Roundtable hadn’t adopted a final text. Its main purpose was to offer a platform for free expression to the participants whose many had just come out from underground. Several representatives of UNESCO Member States also attended the Roundtable as observers, among them some [[African Diplomatic Corps|African diplomats]] who had asked the Director General that a similar conference be held on their continent. The Windhoek seminar was organized in response to their request.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== The Windhoek process ==
At the 26th session of the General Conference (November 1991), the Member States of UNESCO expressed their deep satisfaction with the outcome of the Windhoek seminar and invited the Director-General “to extend to other regions of the world the action taken so far in Africa and Europe to encourage press freedom and to promote the independence and [[Media Pluralism|pluralism]] of the media; (b) to celebrate the anniversary of the Windhoek Declaration adopted on 3 May 1991; (c) to transmit to the United Nations General Assembly the wish expressed by the Member States of UNESCO to have 3 May declared ‘International Press Freedom Day”.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO General Conference, 26th Session, [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0009/000904/090448E.pdf Resolution 26 C/4.3]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The implementation of resolution 26C/4.3 initiated a process in which all initiatives were related to each other. Thus, the Windhoek Declaration had a catalytic function in the democratization movement that was transforming the international media landscape of the 1990s. It was in this framework that UNESCO and the United Nations, with the support of professional media organizations, have jointly-organized four regional seminars similar to the Windhoek seminar: the first for the [[Asia|Asian]] media ([[Almaty|Alma Ata]], [[Kazakhstan]]; October 1992), the second for countries from Latin America and the Caribbean ([[Santiago]], [[Chile]]; May 1994), the third for [[Arab world|Arab countries]] ([[Sana'a|Sana’a]], [[Yemen]]; January 1966) and the last one for Europe and North America ([[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]; September 1997).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Each seminar ended with the adoption of a declaration in which participants highlighted “their full support and entire adhesion to the fundamental principles of the Windhoek Declaration, recognizing its crucial importance for the promotion of free, [[Media independence|independent]] and pluralistic media, in written and broadcast press, worldwide”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001492/149256fo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO’s General Conference endorsed the five declarations of Windhoek, Alma Ata, Santiago, Sana’a and Sofia at its 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; session for the first three (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Conférence générale de l’UNESCO, 28e session, Résolution 28 C/4.6&lt;/ref&gt; and its 29&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; for the last two (1997).&lt;ref&gt;Conférence générale de l’UNESCO, 29e session, Résolution 29 C/34 et 29 C/35&lt;/ref&gt; It is unusual for the Member States of an international organization to adopt texts coming from the civil society without making any changes, more so that these declarations are very critical of the politics and practices of certain States towards medias (without making specific reference to any of them).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In addition to the adoption of the five declarations by UNESCO’s Member States, the “Windhoek process” has produced other significant results in the media field:

* In February 1992, UNESCO’s [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]] (IPDC) has changed its operating rules to take into account the Windhoek Declaration’s recommendations. Since then, projects submitted by the private sector have been able to benefit from the IPDC’s financial support, on the same terms as those from the public sector. Editorial independence is a common criterion.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pressing for freedom: 20 years of World Press Freedom Day|last=Horsley|first=William|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=235484&amp;set=005B17E033_1_251&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1992, UNESCO has provided its support to the establishment of an international alert network based in [[Toronto]], the [[IFEX (organization)|International Freedom of Expression Exchange]] (IFEX)&lt;ref&gt;www.ifex.org &lt;/ref&gt; as well as to the creation of the [[Media Institute of Southern Africa]] (MISA),&lt;ref&gt;www.misa.org &lt;/ref&gt; one of whose mission is to support the implementation of the Windhoek Declaration’s recommendations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* In December 1993, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] proclaimed the 3d of May [[World Press Freedom Day]], thus embodying the proposal made by the Windhoek seminar participants and taken over by UNESCO’s General Conference.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* On the occasion of the 1996 3rd of May celebration, UNESCO’s Director-General announced the creation of the [[UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize]] which was a proposal made by the participants to the 1993 Santiago seminar.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This prize is destined to distinguish a person, organization or institution which has contributed noticeably to the defense and/or promotion of [[Freedom of the press|press freedom]] in the world. It was awarded for the first time in 1997 and, since then, awarded every year by the Director-General in the occasion of World Press Freedom Day.

The personal commitment of a few African diplomats in [[Paris]] (UNESCO), [[Geneva]] ([[United Nations Economic and Social Council|ECOSOC]]) and [[New York City|New York]] (UN General Assembly) has been crucial to the success of the Windhoek process.They were those who put forward and defended in these intergovernmental fora the suggestion made at Windhoek by journalists to establish World Press Freedom Day annually celebrated on May 3. They were also those who sponsored a draft resolution to the UNESCO General Conference intended to endorse the Windhoek Declaration. This African initiative has opened the path to the four other Declarations of Alma Ata, Santiago, Sana’a and Sofia to be adopted without objection. For the Ambassador of Niger Lambert Messan, president in 1995 of the UNESCO African Group, “the Windhoek Declaration is the African contribution to the edifice of [[human rights]]”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Theobald Wolfe Tone''', posthumously known as '''Wolfe Tone''' (20 June 1763 – 19 November 1798), was a leading Irish revolutionary figure and one of the founding members of the [[United Irishmen]], and is regarded as the father of [[Irish republicanism]] and leader of the [[1798 Irish Rebellion]]. He was captured at [[Letterkenny]] port on 3 November 1798,&lt;ref&gt;Memoirs of Theobald Wolfe Tone, Vol. II, p1827&lt;/ref&gt; and he died sixteen days later for reasons that are disputed.

==Early life==
Theobald Wolfe Tone was born on 20 June 1763. The Tones were descended from a [[French Protestant]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} family who fled to England from [[Gascony]] in the 16th century to escape religious persecution. {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} A branch of the family settled in Dublin in the 17th century. Theobald's father Peter Tone was a [[Church of Ireland]] coach-maker who had a farm near [[Sallins]], [[County Kildare]]. His mother came from a Catholic merchant family who converted to Protestantism after Theobald was born.&lt;ref&gt;McGarry,S.,''Irish Brigades Abroad'' (Dublin 2013) p.175&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandfather was captain of a vessel in the [[West Indies|West India]] trade.&lt;ref name=Tone&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/autobiographyoft00toneuoft#page/4/mode/2up Tone, Theobald Wolfe. ''The Autobiography of Theobald Wolfe Tone'', Sean O'Faolain ed., Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons Ltd., London, 1937]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
He was baptised as Theobald Wolfe Tone in honour of his [[Godparent|godfather]], Theobald Wolfe of Blackhall, [[County Kildare]], a first cousin of [[Arthur Wolfe, 1st Viscount Kilwarden]]. However, it was widely believed that Tone was the son of Theobald Wolfe, which if true made him a half-brother of the poet [[Charles Wolfe]].

In 1783, Tone found work as a tutor to Anthony and Robert, younger half-brothers of [[Richard Martin (Irish politician)|Richard Martin]] MP of [[Galway]], a prominent supporter of [[Catholic Emancipation]], at Dangan, the Martin family home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/letters/tone-and-humanity-dick-1.163610|title=Tone and Humanity Dick|last=Fitzgerald|first=John|date=16 June 1998|work=The Irish Times|access-date=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tone fell in love with Martin's wife, but later wrote that it came to nothing.&lt;ref name=Tone/&gt; During this period he briefly considered a career in the theatre as an actor.&lt;ref&gt;Herr p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied law at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], where he became an active member in the [[College Historical Society]] debating club, and was elected its auditor in 1785. He graduated BA in February 1786.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Tone, Theobald Wolfe|volume=57|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He qualified as a barrister in [[King's Inns]] at the age of 26 and attended the [[Inns of Court]] in London. As a student, he eloped with [[Matilda Tone|Martha Witherington]], daughter of William and Catherine Witherington (née Fanning) of Dublin.&lt;ref name=Webb&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/biography/TheobaldWolfeTone.php Webb, Alfred. "Tone, Theobald Wolfe", ''A Compendium of Irish Biography'', MH Gill &amp; Sons, Dublin, 1878]&lt;/ref&gt; She would go on to change her name to Matilda, on Wolfe Tone's request.

When they married, Tone was 22, Matilda was about 16.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/tone-matilda-c-1769-1849&lt;/ref&gt; He was an uxorious husband; in his journal while he was in France and she in Hamburg in 1796 he wrote: "She is the delight of my eyes, the joy of my heart, the only object for which I wish to live. I doat upon her to distraction."&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/autobiographyoft02tone_0&lt;/ref&gt;

Disappointed at finding no support for a plan that he had submitted to [[William Pitt the Younger]], to found a military colony in Hawaii, Tone initially planned to enlist as a soldier in the [[East India Company]], but applied too late in the year, when no more ships would be sent out until the following spring.&lt;ref name=Tone/&gt;

==Politician==
{{Essay|section|date=February 2010}}
In September 1791 Tone published ''An Argument on behalf of the Catholics of Ireland'',&lt;ref name=Webb/&gt; signed "A Northern Whig".&lt;ref name=Milligan&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/lifeoftheobaldwo00millrich#page/20/mode/2up Milligan, Alice L, ''Life of Theobald Wolfe Tone'', JW Boyd, Belfast, 1898]&lt;/ref&gt; "A Northern Whig" emphasised the growing breach between [[British Whig Party|Whig]] patriots like [[Henry Flood]] and [[Henry Grattan]], who sought [[Catholic emancipation]] and parliamentary reform without severing the tie to England. Tone expressed contempt for the constitution Grattan so triumphantly extorted from the British government in 1782; himself an [[Anglican]], Tone urged co-operation between the religions in Ireland as the only means of obtaining redress of Irish grievances. The British government had just passed the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791]], but the Dublin parliament was in no hurry to do so. 

[[File:One of the inscribed flagstones on the steps leading to the grave.jpg|thumb|One of the inscribed flagstones on the steps leading to the grave of Theobald Wolfe Tone]]

In October 1791 Tone converted these ideas into practical policy by founding, in conjunction with [[Thomas Russell (rebel)|Thomas Russell]] (1767–1803), [[James Napper Tandy|Napper Tandy]] and others, the [[Society of the United Irishmen]].&lt;ref name=Milligan/&gt; Until 1794, this society aimed at no more than the formation of a political union between [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]] and [[Church of England|Protestants]], with a view to obtaining a liberal measure of parliamentary reform.&lt;ref name=Hull&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/HullHistory/Revolution1.php Hull, Eleanor. ''A History of Ireland and Her People'', Vol.2, 1931]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1792 he was appointed assistant secretary of the Catholic Committee.&lt;ref name=Milligan/&gt;

The Catholics involved were not united regarding the steps they were taking, and in December 1791, sixty-eight members withdrew, led by [[Thomas Browne, 4th Viscount Kenmare|Lord Kenmare]], with the support of the higher clergy. When the British government questioned the legality of the Catholic Convention called in December 1792, Tone drew up for the committee a statement of the case on which a favourable opinion of counsel was obtained. A petition was made to King [[George III]] early in 1793, and that year the re-enfranchisement of Catholics was enacted – if they owned property as "[[forty-shilling freeholders]]". They could not, however, enter parliament or be made state officials above grand jurors. The Convention voted to Tone a sum of £1,500 with a gold medal and voted to dissolve.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;

Sectarian animosity threatened to undermine the United Irishmen movement: two secret societies in [[Ulster]] fought against each other, the agrarian Protestant [[Peep o' Day Boys]] and their Catholic opponents the [[Defenders (Ireland)|Defenders]].

In 1794 the Society of United Irishmen became a sworn association, using oaths that clearly aimed at the overthrow of the state. Given that France and Britain had been at war since the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] of early 1793, administering or making such oaths turned the society into something more{{vague|date=March 2018}} than a liberal pressure-group.

Affiliating so closely with the new [[French First Republic|French Republic]] also associated Tone with its policy of [[Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution|"Dechristianization"]], which was strongly opposed by the [[Catholic Church in Ireland]]. Seen as a Catholic champion in the early 1790s, much of his Catholic support fell away after 1793. 

Also in 1794, the United Irishmen, persuaded that no party in the Dublin parliament (in which representation{{vague|reason= right to vote for rep, or to be a rep? Or for that matter, right to be counted in a census that influenced the boundaries of constituencies?|date=March 2018}} was limited to Protestants) seemed likely to accept their scheme of male-only [[universal suffrage]] and equal electoral districts, began to found their hopes on a French invasion. An Irish clergyman living in England, the [[Reverend William Jackson]], who had taken in revolutionary opinions during his long stay in France, came to Ireland to ascertain to what extent the Irish people were ready to support a French invasion.&lt;ref name=Webb/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wolfe Tone|last=Elliott|first=Marianne|publisher=Liverpool University Press|year=2012|isbn=|edition=2|location=Liverpool|pages=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tone drew up a memorandum for Jackson on the state of Ireland, which he described as ripe for revolution. An attorney named Cockayne, to whom Jackson had imprudently disclosed his mission, betrayed the memorandum to the government; and in April 1794 Jackson was arrested on a charge of treason.&lt;ref name=Hull/&gt;

Several of the leading United Irishmen, including [[Archibald Hamilton Rowan]], fled the country; the papers of the United Irishmen were seized{{by whom|date=August 2014}}, and for a time the organisation was broken up. Tone, who had not attended meetings of the society since May 1793, remained in Ireland until after the trial of Jackson and his suicide in April 1795. Having friends among the government party, including members of the Beresford family, he succeeded in making terms with the government, and emigrated to the United States, where he arrived in May 1795. Before leaving, he and his family travelled to [[Belfast]], and it was at the summit of [[Cavehill]] that Tone made the Cavehill Compact with fellow Irish radicals, including Russell and [[Henry Joy McCracken|McCracken]], promising "never to desist in our efforts until we had subverted the authority of England over our country, and asserted our independence."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The United Irishmen reformed in 1796. The Society began seriously to look to France to support a rising with troops.&lt;ref name=Hull/&gt;

Living in [[Philadelphia]], Tone wrote a few months later to Thomas Russell expressing unqualified dislike of the American people, whom he imagined to be no more truly democratic in sentiment and no less attached to authority than the British; he described Patriot hero [[George Washington]] as a "high-flying aristocrat", and he found the aristocracy of money and achievement in America still less to his liking than the European aristocracy of birth. Tone also lived briefly in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania|West Chester]] and in [[Downingtown, Pennsylvania]].

Finding himself at Philadelphia in the company of Reynolds, Rowan, and Tandy, Tone went to Paris to persuade the French government to send an expedition to invade Ireland. In February 1796 he arrived in Paris and had interviews with De La Croix and [[Lazare Nicolas Marguerite Carnot|Carnot]], who were impressed by his energy, sincerity, and ability. A commission was given him as adjutant-general in the French army, which he hoped might protect him from the penalty of treason in the event of capture by the British; though he himself claimed the authorship of a proclamation said to have been issued by the United Irishmen, enjoining that all Irishmen taken with arms in their hands in the British service should be instantly shot{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}; and he supported a project for landing [[La Legion Noire]] in England, who were to burn [[Bristol]], England and commit other atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Life of Theobald Wolfe Tone | first=Theobald Wolfe | last=Tone |author2=William Theobald Wolfe Tone  | publisher=Whittaker, Treacher and Arnot | location=London | year=1831 | pages=213–214 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EJMEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA214 | accessdate=30 July 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
He drew up two memorials representing that the landing of a considerable French force in Ireland would be followed by a general rising of the people, and giving a detailed account of the condition of the country.

A sympathizer wrote of him, in French,  saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Wolf Tone was sent to France to claim the support of the [[French Directory|Directory]], under the express condition that the French should come to Ireland as allies, and should act under direction of the new government, as [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]] had done in America.  With this view, Tone had frequently conferences at Paris with Hoche; and the Directory finally determined to send from Brest a fleet of forty-five sail, with an army of fifteen thousand men, under the charge of this able general, December 15, 1796.  England was saved by a violent tempest.&lt;ref&gt;

==Hoche's Expedition and the 1798 Rebellion==

''See also [[French expedition to Ireland (1796)]] and [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]''

The [[French Directory]] planned a military landing in Ireland in support of the coming revolution foretold by Tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Directory |last=Lefebvre |first=Georges |year=1967 |publisher=Vintage |location=New York |isbn= |page=77 |oclc=1015771 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Directory possessed information from [[Lord Edward FitzGerald]] and Arthur O'Connor confirming Tone, and prepared to despatch an expedition under [[Louis Lazare Hoche]]. On 15 December 1796, the expedition, consisting of forty-three sail and carrying about 14,450 men with a large supply of war material for distribution in Ireland, sailed from [[Brest, France|Brest]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian McBride, ''Eighteenth century Ireland'', (Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 2009) p.367&lt;/ref&gt; Tone accompanied it as "Adjutant-general Smith" and had the greatest contempt for the seamanship of the French sailors, who were unable to land due to severe gales. They waited for days off [[Bantry Bay]], waiting for the winds to ease, but eventually returned to France.

Tone served for some months in the French army under Hoche, who had become the French Republic's minister of war after his victory against the Austrians at the [[Battle of Neuwied]] on the Rhine in April 1797. In June 1797 Tone took part in preparations for a military expedition to Ireland from the [[Batavian Republic]], a [[Puppet state|puppet-state]] created during the [[Batavian Revolution]] in the Lowlands in January 1795. However, the Batavian fleet under Dutch Vice-Admiral [[Jan de Winter]] was delayed in the harbour of [[Texel|Texel island]] that summer by unfavourable easterly winds and from mid-August by a British North-Sea fleet blockade. It eventually put to sea in the first week of October only to be immediately crushed by Admiral [[Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan|Adam Duncan]] in the [[Battle of Camperdown]] on October 11, 1797. Tone then returned to Paris. General Hoche, once tasked with an Irish expeditionary force, died of tuberculosis on 19 September 1797 at [[Wetzlar]] after returning to his command on France's Rhine frontier.

In Ireland the membership of the United Irish had reached 300,000, about 6% of the population,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/past/famine/demographics_pre.html Irish population estimates 1700-1841]&lt;/ref&gt; but a vicious counter-insurgency campaign in 1797 weakened the organisation and forced the leadership to launch a rising without French aid. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], with whom Tone had several interviews at this time, was less disposed than Hoche had been to undertake in earnest an Irish expedition; and when [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|the Rising]] broke out in Ireland in 1798 he had started for Egypt. When Tone urged the Directory to send effective assistance to the Irish rebels, all that could be promised was a number of raids to descend simultaneously around the Irish coast. One of these under [[General Humbert]] succeeded in landing a force near [[Killala]], [[County Mayo]], and gained some success in [[Connacht]] (particularly at [[Castlebar]]) before it was subdued by Lake and [[Charles Cornwallis]]. Wolfe Tone's brother Matthew was captured, tried by [[court-martial]], and hanged; a second raid, accompanied by [[Napper Tandy]], came to disaster on the coast of [[Donegal]]; while Wolfe Tone took part in a third, under Admiral [[Jean-Baptiste-François Bompart]], with General [[Jean Hardy]] in command of a force of about 3,000 men. This encountered an English squadron at [[Buncrana]] on [[Lough Swilly]] on 12 October 1798. Tone, on board the ship ''Hoche'', refused Bompart's offer of escape in a [[frigate]] before the [[battle of Tory Island]], and was taken prisoner when the ''Hoche'' surrendered. Tone was brought ashore at Letterkenny Port and all French forces of the Hoche were taken to Lord Cavan in Letterkenny's home where he faced arrest.

==Death==
[[File:Grave of Wolfe Tone.jpg|thumb|250px|Grave of Wolfe Tone, [[Bodenstown]] (coordinates 53°15'45.3"N 6°39'57.3"W)]]
When the prisoners were landed a fortnight later, Sir George Hill recognised Tone in the French adjutant-general's uniform in Lord Cavans privy-quarters at Letterkenny.&lt;ref&gt;Memoirs of Theobald Wolfe Tone, Vol. II, p1829&lt;/ref&gt; At his trial by court-martial in Dublin on 8 November 1798 Tone made a speech avowing his determined hostility to England and his intention "by frank and open war to procure the separation of the countries".&lt;ref name=sampson&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://rewinn.com/8043.html
|title=Speech of Theobold Wolf Tone, To the Court-Martial, assembled to pass sentence on his life in ''Memoirs of William Sampson''
|edition = 2nd
|year=1817
|accessdate=8 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Recognising that the court was certain to convict him, he asked that "the court should adjudge me to die the death of a soldier, and that I may be shot". Reading from a prepared speech, he defended his view of a military separation from Britain (as had occurred in the fledgling United States), he explained his motives:

{{Pull quote|I entered into the service of the French republic with the sole view of being useful to my country.  To contend against British Tyranny, I have braved the fatigues and terrors of the field of battle; I have sacrificed my comfort, have courted poverty, have left my wife unprotected, and my children without a father.  After all I have done for a sacred cause, death is no sacrifice.  In such enterprises, everything depends on success:  Washington succeeded – [[Tadeusz Kościuszko|Kosciusko]] failed.  I know my fate, but I neither ask for pardon nor do I complain.  I admit openly all I have said, written, and done, and am prepared to meet the consequences.  As, however, I occupy a high grade in the French army, I would request that the court, if they can, grant me the favor that I may die the death of a soldier.}}

A commentary on the trial continues: "After a long silence, interrupted by some expressions of admiration, he was told that his request should be submitted to the lord-lieutenant.  Thinking, however, that there was but little prospect, he committed suicide in prison.  With Wolfe Tone, terminated the insurrection of 1798. He was the prime mover of it, and was its last victim…"&lt;ref&gt;The Criminal History of the English Government from the First Massacre of the Irish, to the Poisoning of the Chinese, Translated from the French, with Notes by an American&lt;/ref&gt;

He also lamented the outbreak of mass violence, saying: "Such are my principles such has been my conduct; if in consequence of the measures in which I have been engaged misfortunes have been brought upon this country, I heartily lament it, but let it be remembered that it is now nearly four years since I have quit Ireland and consequently I have been personally concerned in none of them; if I am rightly informed very great atrocities have been committed on both sides, but that does not at all diminish my regret; for a fair and open war I was prepared; if that has degenerated into a system of assassination, massacre, and plunder I do again most sincerely lament it, and those few who know me personally will give me I am sure credit for the assertion."&lt;ref&gt;cited by Marianne Eliot, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;

To the people, he had the following to say from the dock:

{{Pull quote|I have laboured to abolish the infernal spirit of religious persecution, by uniting the Catholics and Dissenters. To the former I owe more than ever can be repaid. The service I was so fortunate as to render them they rewarded munificently; but they did more: when the public cry was raised against me—when the friends of my youth swarmed off and left me alone—the Catholics did not desert me; they had the virtue even to sacrifice their own interests to a rigid principle of honour; they refused, though strongly urged, to disgrace a man who, whatever his conduct towards the Government might have been, had faithfully and conscientiously discharged his duty towards them; and in so doing, though it was in my own case, I will say they showed an instance of public virtue of which I know not whether there exists another example|Seán Ua Ceallaigh (ed.), ''Speeches from the Dock, or Protests of Irish Patriotism''}}

[[File:Earlier version of Headstone from 1945.jpg|thumb|Earlier version of Tone's headstone, from 1945]]

His eloquence was in vain, and his request to be shot was denied. On 10 November 1798, he was found guilty and was sentenced to be hanged on 12 November. Before this sentence was carried out, either he attempted suicide by slitting his throat or British soldiers tortured and mortally wounded Tone. The story goes that he was initially saved when the wound was sealed with a bandage, and he was told if he tried to talk the wound would open and he would bleed to death. He responded by saying "I can yet find words to thank you sir; it is the most welcome news you could give me. What should I wish to live for?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Life of Theobald Wolfe Tone | first=Theobald Wolfe | last=Tone |author2=William Theobald Wolfe Tone  | publisher=Whittaker, Treacher and Arnot | location=London | year=1831 | pages=314–316 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EJMEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA314}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Theobald Wolfe Tone died on 19 November 1798 at the age of 35 in Provost's Prison, Dublin, not far from where he was born. He is buried in Bodenstown, Co. Kildare, near his birthplace at Sallins, and his grave is in the care of the [[National Graves Association]].

==Support from Lord Kilwarden==
[[File:WolfeToneStatue.JPG|thumb|250px|''Wolfe Tone'' (1967) statue on [[St. Stephen's Green]], Dublin by [[Edward Delaney]]]]

His godfather Theobald Wolfe was Tone's natural father, according to several sources. A cousin, Arthur Wolfe, [[Arthur Wolfe, 1st Viscount Kilwarden|Lord Kilwarden]], warned Tone to leave Ireland in 1795. Then when Tone was arrested and brought to Dublin in 1798, and facing certain execution, it was Kilwarden (a senior judge) who granted two orders for ''[[Habeas Corpus]]'' for his release. This was a remarkable act, given that the rebellion had just occurred with great loss of life, and one that could never be enlarged upon as Kilwarden was killed at the beginning of [[Robert Emmet|Emmet's]] revolt in 1803. The Wolfes knew that Tone was their cousin. As a pillar of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] and notorious at the time for his prosecution of United Irishman [[William Orr (United Irishman)|William Orr]], Kilwarden had no other obvious motive for trying to assist Tone in 1795 and 1798. Portraits of Wolfe around 1800 arguably show a resemblance to Wolfe Tone.&lt;ref&gt;C Costello, ''A Class Apart The Gentry Families of County Kildare'' (Nonesuch, Dublin 2005) p98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maud Wolfe (1892–1980), the last of the Wolfes to live in Kildare, continued her family tradition of annually laying flowers at Tone's grave until her death.&lt;ref&gt;W. Nolan (ed), Kildare History and Society (Geography, Dublin 2006) p395. {{ISBN|978-0-906602-57-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leinster Leader obituary of Ms Wolfe, 21 June 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

"[Tone] rises", said [[William Edward Hartpole Lecky|William Lecky]], the 19th-century historian, "far above the dreary level of commonplace which Irish conspiracy in general presents… His judgement of men and things was keen, lucid and masculine, and he was alike prompt in decision and brave in action."&lt;ref&gt;''History of Ireland in the Eighteenth Century''vol 5, by [[WEH Lecky]], Longmans, Greens and Co (London), P79 (cabinet ed, 5 vols, London, 1892)&lt;/ref&gt;

His journals, which were written for his family and intimate friends were published after his death by his son, William Theobald Wolfe Tone.

Tone was adopted by the [[Young Ireland]] movement of the 1840s as an iconic figure, as the father of Irish republicanism and above religious divisions. Its leader [[Thomas Davis (Young Irelander)|Thomas Davis]] found and publicised the location of Tone's grave in 1843. Modern republicans quote his ideals:

{{Pull quote|To subvert the tyranny of our execrable government, to break the connection with England, the never-failing source of all our political evils, and to assert the independence of my country—these were my objects. To unite the whole people of Ireland, to abolish the memory of all past dissentions, and to substitute the common name of Irishman in the place of the denominations of Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter—these were my means.

To unite Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter under the common name of Irishmen in order to break the connection with England, the never failing source of all our political evils, that was my aim'.

If the men of property will not support us, they must fall. Our strength shall come from that great and respectable class, the men of no property.}}

Every summer, Irish Republicans hold commemorations at Tone's grave in Bodenstown.

An attempt on 17 June 1934 by Protestant [[Republican Congress]] members from Belfast to join in the commemoration march was prevented by IRA stewards. The marchers were stoned and "scuffles broke out".&lt;ref&gt;Durney, J (2001) ''On the one road'', Naas, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; This was portrayed by some commentators as sectarianism, that republicans had abandoned Tone's aim to unite Irishmen by ignoring their religious differences, paying tribute only to his anti-British republicanism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irish Times]] 28 February 2006, p16. [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2006/0228/1140626822824.html IrishTimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Brian Hanley's history of the IRA from 1926 to 1936 concludes that the trouble arose because they were seen as "communist", and not for sectarian reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourcourtspress.ie/product.php?intProductID=325 FourCourtsPress.ie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620050738/http://www.fourcourtspress.ie/product.php?intProductID=325 |date=20 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This seems highly unlikely, as the [[Communist Party of Ireland]] had been legalised from 1932, and the stonings must have been sectarian, which Tone himself was not.

==Descendants==
Of Tone's four children, three died prematurely. His eldest child, Maria Tone (born 1786 in Dublin, died 1803 in Paris) and his youngest child, Francis Rawdon Tone (1793-1806) both died of [[tuberculosis]]. Another son, Richard Tone (born 1787/89) died in infancy.

Only his son William Theobald Wolfe Tone survived to adulthood. Raised in France by his mother after Tone's death, William was appointed a cadet in the [[Imperial School of Cavalry]] in 1810 on Napoleon's orders. He was naturalised a French citizen on 4 May 1812. In January 1813 he was made sub-lieutenant in the 8th Regiment of Chasseurs and joined the Grand Army in Germany (his [[nom de guerre]] was the punning ''le petit loup'' – the little wolf. He was at the battles of Löwenberg, Goldberg, Dresden, Bauthen, Mühlberg, Aachen, and Leipzig. He received six lance wounds at the Battle of Leipzig, was promoted to lieutenant and aide-de-camp of General Bagneres and was decorated with the Legion of Honour.

After the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, he emigrated to the United States, where he was commissioned a Captain in the United States Army and died there on 11 October 1828 at the age of 37. Matilda Tone also emigrated to the United States, and is buried in [[Green-Wood Cemetery|Greenwood Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn]], New York.

William Tone was survived by his only child, his daughter Grace Georgina.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25400">The '''Working Group on Arbitrary Detention''' is a body of independent [[human rights]] experts that investigate cases of arbitrary arrest and detention. [[Arbitrary arrest and detention]] is the imprisonment or detainment of an individual, by a State, without respect for due process. These actions may be in violation of [[international human rights law]].

The Working Group was established by resolution in 1991 by the former [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|Commission on Human Rights]]. It is one of the thematic special procedures overseen by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], and is therefore a subsidiary body of the UN.

==Mandate and composition==

The Working Group is mandated to receive and verify information from a variety of sources, in order to investigate cases of detention imposed arbitrarily, or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpil.de/files/pdf2/mpunyb_rudolf_4.pdf The Thematic Rapporteurs and Working Groups of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights p.311]&lt;/ref&gt;  Article 9 states: ‘No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile’. In considering claims of arbitrary detention, the Working Group is not only guided by State national law, but other international legal instruments may also be relevant if accepted by the States concerned. For example, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], Article 9(1) states; “Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. No one shall be Deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law.”

The Working Group's role is to investigate individual cases of arbitrary detention, as well as situations where the conditions in a country prompt concern over widespread occurrences of arbitrary detention. It has an intentionally broad mandate, to allow flexibility, and allow anyone to seek its assistance. The Working Group may send urgent appeals to governments to ascertain the whereabouts and condition of those allegedly detained, issues opinions on the compliance with international law and may also conduct fact-finding visits to countries. The Working Group also issue deliberations on issues, to assist States in avoiding behaviour that may enable arbitrary detention. Ensuring a communicative dialogue with Governments and intergovernmental and [[non-governmental organisations]] allows the Working Group to achieve success. The Working Group must work in coordination with other Human Rights Council mechanisms and is mandated to carry out its task with discretion, objectivity and independence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/WGADIndex.aspx United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Working Group mandate reflects the Commission’s concerns regarding worldwide instances of detention without legal basis. The Commission on Human Rights entrusted the Working Group with the following mandate:

# To investigate cases of detention imposed arbitrarily in individual cases 
# To complete field missions in order to receive information from Government and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, and receive information from the individuals concerned, their families or their representatives; 
# To present annual reports to the Human Rights Council

The mandate lasts for a period of three years, and was most recently extended for a further three-year period by Human Rights Council resolution 33/30 of 30 September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G16/228/05/PDF/G1622805.pdf?OpenElement United Nations General Assembly Resolution 33/30]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership===

The Working Group is composed of five independent experts. They are appointed in equitable geographical distribution from the following regions: Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and Other Countries, and South America and Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. "The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence." Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Three sessions are held per year, each lasting between five and eight days.

==Process==

The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is tasked with acting on information of alleged cases of arbitrary detention. To fulfil this mandate, the Working Group may decide individual complaints of arbitrary detention, formulate deliberations to provide guidance on the interpretation of international standards related to detention circumstances and provide reports for the Human Rights Council. It may undertake country visits to achieve this.

The Working Group does not require the exhaustion of local remedies. However, its purpose is not to replace national courts.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. "The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence." Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; This broadens its jurisdiction, as it allows the Group to bypass governments that may be stalling procedure.

Detention in itself does not necessarily violate human rights. Therefore, the Working Group must distinguish between lawful exercise of police power, and detention so lacking in lawful basis or otherwise unreasonable, that it must be considered arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. "The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence." Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual complaints and urgent appeals==

===Individual complaints===

The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is unique in that its mandate expressly provides for the consideration of individual complaints. Individuals anywhere in the world are therefore able to petition the Working Group for consideration. The Group acts on information submitted to it by individuals directly, their families, or through representatives of [[Non-governmental organisations]].

The Working Group then sends communications to the Governments concerned, to clarify or bring attention to the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/Complaints.aspx United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt; The Government is invited to respond to the allegations within 60 days, with its view on the issue. The Working Group then sends the reply to the source of the allegations, requesting more information. This process allows the Group to remain neutral in the information-gathering process.&lt;ref&gt;Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756&lt;/ref&gt;

The Working Group has identified detention or imprisonment as arbitrary if it falls into one of the following categories;
# Imposed without any legal basis
# Imposed because of the exercise of human rights 
# Imposed in violation of the principle of fair trial
# Prolonged administrative custody imposed on asylum seekers, immigrants or refugees
# Based on illegal discriminatory grounds

Examples of this can include continued detention after the completion of a sentence, denial of the exercise of fundamental rights such as freedom of expression, violations of the right to a fair trial, asylum and immigration claims, or detention based on ethnicity; religion; sexual orientation, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpil.de/files/pdf2/mpunyb_rudolf_4.pdf The Thematic Rapporteurs and Working Groups of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights p.317]&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon receiving information under this adversary procedure, the Working Group then adopts one of the following approaches;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/Complaints.aspx], The UN.&lt;/ref&gt;

* If the individual concerned has been released, the Group may still decide to formulate an opinion on whether or not the deprivation of liberty was arbitrary
* The Group may find that the deprivation of liberty is not arbitrary, and will state an opinion as such
* The Group may seek further information from the individual or the Government
* If further information is unable to be sought, the Group may file the case subject to further confirmation
* The Group may decide that the arbitrary deprivation of liberty has been established, state an opinion to that effect, and make recommendations to the Government. These are then communicated to the Government. The opinion requests that the state takes the necessary steps to remedy the situation in order to bring it into conformity. The fulfilment of this request is often achieved by the release of the individual.

Upon evaluating contradicting evidence, such as between an individual claiming arbitrary deprivation of liberty and a government, the Working Group use a standard of 'convincing evidence', as opposed to evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpil.de/files/pdf2/mpunyb_rudolf_4.pdf The Thematic Rapporteurs and Working Groups of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights p.315]&lt;/ref&gt; The informal nature of the Working Group can strengthen the position of the individual represented, by easing the objective burden of proof on them.

===Urgent appeals===

If the Working Group receives information that raises concern about the immediate wellbeing of an individual, then it may, at its discretion, pursue an urgent action. The source must provide sufficiently reliable information that the continuation of deprivation poses significant threat to the psychological or physical wellbeing to the individual.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. "The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence." Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The alleged situation may be time-sensitive in relation to loss of life or deportation. Rapid communication is sought with diplomats, such as the Foreign Minister (or equivalent). The Working Group request immediate action to ensure the detained person's right to life, as well as physical and mental integrity are respected.&lt;ref&gt;Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights, Fact Sheet No. 26, The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, available at http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet26en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This a purely humanitarian undertaking, and does not prejudice the Working Group's final opinion on whether the deprivation of liberty is indeed arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/Complaints.aspx United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advisory procedures==

===Country visits===

In order to fulfil its mandate, the Working Group may conduct country visits. These provide an opportunity for the Group to understand the specific situation prevailing in countries. The Group undertake one to three country visits per year, upon invitation from the Government concerned.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. "The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence." Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in May 2017 the Working Group visited Argentina. In 2016 the Group visited the United States of America and Azerbaijan. The Group tend to visit between one and four countries per year.

On a country visit, members of the Working Group engage in a variety of tasks. These can include meeting with representatives of the executive, legislators, and other state officials. The Group also has the right to visit places of detention and have private discussions with detainees.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. "The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence." They also enable the Working Group to evaluate internal legislation for its compatibility with international standards. Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Country visits enable the Working Group to gain a greater understanding of the social, political and historical environment in each country, enabling them to create context-appropriate recommendations.

===Deliberations===

More generally, the Working Group seeks to encourage broader international understanding of arbitrary detention, and promote universal standards.&lt;ref&gt;Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved through a more general advisory role, with the formulation of deliberations.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. "The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence." Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The Group formulates deliberations on general issues to assist States in safeguarding against the practice of arbitrary deprivation of liberty. For example, the Group have developed deliberations on issues relating to house arrest, psychiatric detention, deprivation of liberty subsequent to a conviction and resulting from the use of the internet, on rehabilitation through labour and situations regarding immigrants and asylum seekers. The Group have also provided legal analysis regarding the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] and clarified the definition of arbitrary deprivation of liberty under customary international law and the urgent appeals procedure.

===Annual reports===

The Working Group must submit Annual Reports to the Human Rights Council, summarising the previous year's activities. The report will express observations made while investigating cases and on field missions in differing countries. The report details the Working Group's reasoning behind legal insufficiencies, policies and judicial policies that are the cause of arbitrary deprivation of liberty, and recommend best practice to safeguard against arbitrary deprivation of liberty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/Annual.aspx United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

The Group functions as a [[quasi-judicial body]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpil.de/files/pdf2/mpunyb_rudolf_4.pdf The Thematic Rapporteurs and Working Groups of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights p.315]&lt;/ref&gt; The Group has no direct enforcement power of its own. Instead, it relies on communication among states, policy-makers and advocates to encourage governments to implement its recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its reliance on the cooperation of states, it can be argued that this weakens the authority of the Group.

The opinions of the Working Group however are legally binding to the extent that they are based on binding international human rights laws, such as the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. This is applicable to states that have ratified the Covenant.

The opinions of the Working Group are considered authoritative by some prominent international judicial institutions including the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=17013&amp;LangID=E United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt; The features of the Working Group arguably play a role in its success, as it allows it to provide a politically viable alternative to treaty-based human rights enforcement mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Genser, J.

M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756&lt;/ref&gt; While the opinions of the Working Group are not binding on states, they can facilitate information sharing among non-governmental organisations and governments. This can in turn lead to an increase in government accountability.

A further criticism of the Group is that it has taken no steps toward creating a robust follow up procedure, to apply pressure on states arbitrarily detaining individuals. Establishing a systematic follow up procedure could ensure an even greater accountability on governments, acting as a name and shame process to pressure them into action. A follow up procedure may also be beneficial for providing feedback for future policy decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008).

Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756&lt;/ref&gt; It could also aid non-governmental organisations in petitioning governments with unresolved cases. Having a record of resolved cases could help the Group to keep track of the status of detainees and any correlation between the action of the Working Group. Information and statistics drawn from this can be publicised, and help to increase outreach.

==Development of Draft Principles==

In 2012, the [[Human Rights Council]] requested the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to develop draft basic principles. These were to provide guidelines on remedies and procedures for anyone deprived of his or her liberty by arrest or detention to bring proceedings before court, in order that the court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his or her detention and order his or her release if the detention is not lawful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/DraftBasicPrinciples.aspx United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt; The intention behind these were to assist states in fulfilling their obligation to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/55f7d5844.pdf Report of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention]&lt;/ref&gt; States, treaty bodies, human rights institutions and non-governmental organisations were invited to submit details on the treatment of the right to bring such proceedings before a court, in their respective legal frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/DraftBasicPrinciples.aspx United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt; The text was adopted in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Detention/DraftBasicPrinciples/March2015/WGAD.CRP.1.2015.pdf United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable case==

===Julian Assange===
On 5 February 2016, the group released a report stating that Assange had been subject to [[arbitrary detention]] by the UK and Swedish Governments since 7 December 2010, including his time in prison in Britain and Sweden, on conditional bail, and in the Ecuadorian embassy. According to the report, Assange should be allowed to walk free and be given compensation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstpost.com/world/britain-sweden-should-accept-ruling-on-julian-assange-un-high-commissioner-for-human-rights-2618960.html "Britain, Sweden should accept ruling on Julian Assange: UN High Commissioner for Human Rights"].

The UK and Swedish governments rejected the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.skynews.com.au/news/top-stories/2016/02/05/assange-warrant-still-active--uk-police.html |work=Sky News Australia |title=UK, Sweden reject UN ruling on Assange |date=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then-UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, [[Philip Hammond]], said the claim was "ridiculous" and that the group was "made up of lay people", and called Assange a "[[fugitive from justice]]" who "can come out any time he chooses".&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ecuador-sweden-assange-hammond-idUKKCN0VE120 Hammond calls U.N.

On 13th February 2018, the Westminster Magistrates’ Court, while considering whether the arrest warrant issued against Assange should be upheld, rejected the findings of the Working Group, stating in part that "The group appears to have based its conclusions on some misunderstandings of what occurred after Mr Assange’s arrest." Senior District Judge (Chief Magistrate) Emma Arbuthnot did not find that Mr Assange’s stay in the Embassy was "inappropriate, unjust, unpredictable, unreasonable, unnecessary or disproportionate." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43049474 "Julian Assange: Warrant for his arrest upheld by court"].
