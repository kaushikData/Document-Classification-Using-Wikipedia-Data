Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae were proposed as pertaining to this date. A [[New Age]] interpretation held that the date marked the start of a period during which Earth and its inhabitants would undergo a positive physical or [[spiritual transformation]], and that 21 December 2012 would mark the beginning of a new era.&lt;ref name="anasatas" /&gt; Others suggested that the date marked the [[End time|end of the world]] or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world included the arrival of the next [[solar maximum]], an interaction between [[Earth]] and the [[Sagittarius A*|black hole at the center of the galaxy]],&lt;ref name="NASA1" /&gt; or [[Nibiru cataclysm|Earth's collision with a mythical planet called Nibiru]].

Scholars from various disciplines quickly dismissed predictions of concomitant cataclysmic events as they arose. Professional [[Mayanist]] scholars stated that no extant [[Maya codices|classic Maya accounts]] forecast impending doom, and that the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented [[Maya civilization#History|Maya history]] and culture,&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuart"&gt;David Stuart, ''The Order of Days: The Maya World and the Truth about 2012'', Harmony Books, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webster" /&gt; while astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios as [[pseudoscience]],&lt;ref name="Brown 2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=SI do not ♥ pseudo-science|first=Mike|last=Brown|url=http://www.mikebrownsplanets.com/2008/02/i-do-not-pseudo-science.html|year=2008|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers" /&gt; easily refuted by elementary astronomical observations.&lt;ref name="NASA2" /&gt;

== Mesoamerican Long Count calendar ==
{{main|Mesoamerican Long Count calendar}}

December 2012 marked the conclusion of a ''[[b'ak'tun]]''—a time period in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, used in [[Mesoamerica|Central America]] prior to the arrival of Europeans. Although the Long Count was most likely invented by the [[Olmec]],&lt;ref name="delara2006" /&gt; it has become closely associated with the [[Maya civilization]], whose classic period lasted from 250 to 900&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name="Population structure of the classic period Maya" /&gt; The [[Maya script|writing system]] of the classic Maya has been substantially deciphered,&lt;ref name="joyce" /&gt; meaning that a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of their written and inscribed material has survived from before the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán|European conquest]].

Unlike the 260-day ''[[tzolk'in]]'' still used today among the Maya, the Long Count was linear rather than cyclical, and kept time roughly in units of 20: 20 days made a ''uinal'', 18 uinals (360 days) made a ''tun'', 20 tuns made a ''k'atun'', and 20 k'atuns (144,000 days or roughly 394 years) made up a ''b'ak'tun''. Thus, the Maya date of 8.3.2.10.15 represents 8 b'ak'tuns, 3 k'atuns, 2 tuns, 10 uinals and 15 days.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=246}}&lt;ref name="The Astronomical Insignificance of Maya Date 13.0.0.0.0" /&gt;

=== Apocalypse ===
[[File:Popol vuh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The oldest surviving manuscript of the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', dated to 1701|alt=an ancient manuscript page.]]

There is a strong tradition of "world ages" in Maya literature, but the record has been distorted, leaving several possibilities open to interpretation.{{sfn|Severin|1981|p=75}} According to the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', a compilation of the [[Mesoamerican creation accounts|creation accounts]] of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] of the Colonial-era highlands, we are living in the fourth world.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=429–430}} The ''Popol Vuh'' describes the gods first creating three failed worlds, followed by a successful fourth world in which humanity was placed. In the Maya Long Count, the previous world ended after 13 b'ak'tuns, or roughly 5,125 years.{{sfn|Freidel|Schele|Parker|1993|p=63}}{{ref label|A|Note a|a}} The Long Count's "zero date"{{ref label|B|Note b|b}}{{ref label|C|Note c|c}} was set at a point in the past marking the end of the third world and the beginning of the current one, which corresponds to 11 August 3114&amp;nbsp;BC in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]].{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=46}}&lt;ref name=yucalandia/&gt; This means that the fourth world reached the end of its 13th b'ak'tun, or Maya date 13.0.0.0.0, on 21 December 2012. In 1957, Mayanist and astronomer [[Maud Worcester Makemson]] wrote that "the completion of a Great Period of 13 b'ak'tuns would have been of the utmost significance to the Maya."&lt;ref name="makemson1957" /&gt; In 1966, [[Michael D. Coe]] wrote in ''The Maya'' that "there is a suggestion&amp;nbsp;... that Armageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation on the final day of the 13th [b'ak'tun]. Thus&amp;nbsp;... our present universe [would] be annihilated ... when the Great Cycle of the Long Count reaches completion."{{sfn|Coe|1966|p=149}}{{ref label|E|Note e|e}}

=== Objections ===
Coe's interpretation was repeated by other scholars through the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="carrasco1990" /&gt; In contrast, later researchers said that, while the end of the 13th b'ak'tun would perhaps be a cause for celebration,&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; it did not mark the end of the calendar.&lt;ref name="milbrath1999" /&gt; "There is nothing in the Maya or Aztec or ancient Mesoamerican prophecy to suggest that they prophesied a sudden or major change of any sort in 2012," said Mayanist scholar Mark Van Stone. "The notion of a 'Great Cycle' coming to an end is completely a modern invention."&lt;ref name="van" /&gt; In 1990, Mayanist scholars [[Linda Schele]] and David Freidel argued that the Maya "did not conceive this to be the end of creation, as many have suggested".{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=81–82, 430–431}} Susan Milbrath, [[curator]] of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the [[Florida Museum of Natural History]], stated that, "We have no record or knowledge that [the Maya] would think the world would come to an end" in 2012.&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, said, "For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle," and, "The 2012 phenomenon is a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in."&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; "There will be another cycle," said E. Wyllys Andrews V, director of the [[Tulane University]] Middle American Research Institute. "We know the Maya thought there was one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the idea of another one after this."&lt;ref name="The Sky Is Not Falling" /&gt; Commenting on the new calendar found at [[Xultún]], one archaeologist said "The ancient Maya predicted the world would continue&amp;nbsp;– that 7,000 years from now, things would be exactly like this. We keep looking for endings. The Maya were looking for a guarantee that nothing would change. It's an entirely different mindset."&lt;ref name="NG120510" /&gt;

Several prominent individuals representing Maya of Guatemala decried the suggestion that the world would end with the 13th b'ak'tun. Ricardo Cajas, president of the ''Colectivo de Organizaciones Indígenas de Guatemala'', said the date did not represent an end of humanity but that the new cycle "supposes changes in human consciousness". Martín Sacalxot, of the office of the ''[[Procuraduría de los Derechos Humanos (Guatemala)|Procurador de los Derechos Humanos]]'' (Guatemala's Human Rights Ombudsman, PDH), said that the end of the calendar has nothing to do with the end of the world or the year 2012.&lt;ref name="prensalibre" /&gt;

=== Prior associations ===
The European association of the Maya with eschatology dates back to the time of [[Christopher Columbus]], who was compiling a work called ''[[Book of Prophecies|Libro de las profecías]]'' during the voyage in 1502 when he first heard about the "Maia" on [[Guanaja]], an island off the north coast of [[Honduras]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Hoopes 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the writings of Bishop [[Pierre d'Ailly]], Columbus believed that his discovery of "most distant" lands (and, by extension, the Maya themselves) was prophesied and would bring about the [[Apocalypse]]. End-times fears were widespread during the early years of the [[Spanish Conquest]] as the result of popular [[astrology|astrological]] predictions in Europe of a second [[Great Flood]] for the year 1524.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

In the early 1900s, German scholar [[Ernst Förstemann]] interpreted the last page of the [[Dresden Codex]] as a representation of the end of the world in a cataclysmic flood. He made reference to the destruction of the world and an apocalypse, though he made no reference to the 13th b'ak'tun or 2012 and it was not clear that he was referring to a future event.&lt;ref&gt;Förstemann 1906: 264&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas were repeated by archaeologist [[Sylvanus Morley]],&lt;ref&gt;Morley 1915: 32&lt;/ref&gt; who directly paraphrased Förstemann and added his own embellishments, writing, "Finally, on the last page of the manuscript, is depicted the Destruction of the World&amp;nbsp;... Here, indeed, is portrayed with a graphic touch the final all-engulfing cataclysm" in the form of a great flood. These comments were later repeated in Morley's book, ''The Ancient Maya'', the first edition of which was published in 1946.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

== Maya references to b'ak'tun 13 ==
It is not certain what significance the classic [[Maya civilization|Maya]] gave to the 13th b'ak'tun.&lt;ref name="Houston1996" /&gt; Most classic Maya inscriptions are strictly historical and do not make any prophetic declarations.&lt;ref name="Houston1996" /&gt; Two items in the Maya classical corpus, however, do mention the end of the 13th b'ak'tun: Tortuguero Monument 6 and La Corona Hieroglyphic Stairway 12.

=== Tortuguero ===
The [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]] site, which lies in southernmost [[Tabasco]], Mexico, dates from the 7th century AD and consists of a series of inscriptions mostly in honor of the contemporary ruler Bahlam Ajaw. One inscription, known as Tortuguero Monument 6, is the only inscription known to refer to b'ak'tun 13 in any detail. It has been partially defaced; Sven Gronemeyer and Barbara MacLeod have given this translation:

&lt;div style="width: 500px"&gt;
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
: ''tzuhtzjo:m uy-u:xlaju:n pik''
: ''chan ajaw u:x uni:w''
: ''uhto:m il[?]''
: ''ye'ni/ye:n bolon yokte'''
: ''ta chak joyaj''
{{col-2}}
: It will be completed the 13th ''b'ak'tun''.
: It is 4 ''Ajaw'' 3 ''K'ank'in''
: and it will happen a 'seeing'[?].
: It is the display of ''B'olon-Yokte'''
: in a great "investiture".{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|p=8}}
{{col-end}}
&lt;/div&gt;

[[File:Bolon Yokte' K'uh.jpg|thumb|The Tortuguero monument connects the end of the 13th b'ak'tun with the appearance of B'olon Yokte' K'uh, shown here on the Vase of Seven Gods.|alt=Vase illustration in which the god Bolon Yukte is seen in profile, kneeling with his head back and his mouth open. He wears an elaborate feather headdress.]]

Very little is known about the god B'olon Yokte'. According to an article by Mayanists Markus Eberl and Christian Prager in ''British Anthropological Reports'', his name is composed of the elements "nine", 'OK-te' (the meaning of which is unknown), and "god". Confusion in classical period inscriptions suggests that the name was already ancient and unfamiliar to contemporary scribes.&lt;ref name="eberl2005" /&gt; He also appears in inscriptions from [[Palenque]], [[Usumacinta]], and [[La Mar]] as a god of war, conflict, and the underworld. In one [[Maya stelae|stele]] he is portrayed with a rope tied around his neck, and in another with an incense bag, together signifying a sacrifice to end a cycle of years.&lt;ref name="hieroglyphic" /&gt;

Based on observations of modern Maya rituals, Gronemeyer and MacLeod claim that the stela refers to a celebration in which a person portraying Bolon Yokte' K'uh was wrapped in ceremonial garments and paraded around the site.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=11, 36–37}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} They note that the association of Bolon Yokte' K'uh with b'ak'tun 13 appears to be so important on this inscription that it supersedes more typical celebrations such as "erection of stelae, scattering of incense" and so forth. Furthermore, they assert that this event was indeed planned for 2012 and not the 7th century.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=24, 35}} Mayanist scholar [[Stephen D. Houston|Stephen Houston]] contests this view by arguing that future dates on Maya inscriptions were simply meant to draw parallels with contemporary events, and that the words on the stela describe a contemporary rather than a future scene.&lt;ref name="What Will Not Happen in 2012" /&gt;

=== La Corona ===
In April–May 2012, a team of archaeologists unearthed a previously unknown inscription on a stairway at the [[La Corona]] site in [[Guatemala]]. The inscription, on what is known as Hieroglyphic Stairway 12, describes the establishment of a royal court in [[Calakmul]] in 635 AD, and compares the then-recent completion of 13 k'atuns with the future completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. It contains no speculation or prophecy as to what the scribes believed would happen at that time.&lt;ref name="Stuart 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title = Notes on a New Text from La Corona | first = David | last = Stuart | url = http://decipherment.wordpress.com/ | year = 2012 | accessdate = 6 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dates beyond b'ak'tun 13 ===
Maya inscriptions occasionally mention predicted future events or commemorations that would occur on dates far beyond the completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. Most of these are in the form of "distance dates"; Long Count dates together with an additional number, known as a Distance Number, which when added to them makes a future date. On the west panel at the [[Temple of Inscriptions]] in Palenque, a section of text projects forward to the 80th 52-year [[Calendar Round]] from the coronation of the ruler [[K'inich Janaab' Pakal]]. Pakal's accession occurred on 9.9.2.4.8, equivalent to 27 July 615&amp;nbsp;AD in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The inscription begins with Pakal's birthdate of 9.8.9.13.0 (24 March, {{nowrap|603&amp;nbsp;AD Gregorian}}) and then adds the Distance Number 10.11.10.5.8 to it,{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93–95}} arriving at a date of 21 October 4772&amp;nbsp;AD, more than 4,000 years after Pakal's time.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93–95}}{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=430}}

Another example is Stela 1 at [[Coba]] which marks the date of creation as {{nowrap|13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.0.0.0.0}}, or nineteen units above the b'ak'tun. According to Linda Schele, these 13s represent "the starting point of a huge odometer of time", with each acting as a zero and resetting to 1 as the numbers increase.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=81–82, 430–431}}{{ref label|C|Note c|c}} Thus this inscription anticipates the current universe lasting at least 20&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;×13×360 days,&lt;ref name=wagner/&gt; or roughly 2.687×10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; years; a time span equal to 2 quintillion times the [[age of the universe]] as determined by cosmologists. Others have suggested, however, that this date marks creation as having occurred after that time span.&lt;ref name=wagner&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Maya Creation Myths and Cosmography|author=Wagner, Elizabeth|editor=Grube, Nikolai|title=Maya: Divine Kings of the Rainforest|page=283|year=2000|publisher=Konemann|isbn=978-3-8290-4150-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=49}}

In 2012, researchers announced the discovery of a series of Maya astronomical tables in [[Xultún]], Guatemala which plot the movements of the Moon and other astronomical bodies over the course of 17 b'ak'tuns.&lt;ref name="NG120510"&gt;{{cite web | last = Vance | first = Eric | title = Unprecedented Maya Mural Found, Contradicts 2012 "Doomsday" Myth |work=National Geographic |date=10 May 2012 | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/05/120510-maya-2012-doomsday-calendar-end-of-world-science/ |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saturno et al. 11 May 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Science | date = 11 May 2012 | volume = 336 | issue = 6082 | pages = 714–717 | doi = 10.1126/science.1221444 | title = Ancient Maya Astronomical Tables from Xultun, Guatemala |author1=William A.

The general intent of this literature was not to warn of impending doom but "to foster counter-cultural sympathies and eventually socio-political and 'spiritual' activism".&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt; Aveni, who has studied New Age and [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI) communities, describes 2012 narratives as the product of a "disconnected" society: "Unable to find spiritual answers to life's big questions within ourselves, we turn outward to imagined entities that lie far off in space or time—entities that just might be in possession of superior knowledge."{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=161}}

=== Origins ===
In 1975, the ending of b'ak'tun 13 became the subject of speculation by several New Age authors, who asserted it would correspond with a global "transformation of consciousness". In ''Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth Age of Consciousness'', [[Frank Waters]] tied Coe's original date of 24 December 2011{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} to astrology and the prophecies of the [[Hopi]],&lt;ref name="particular" /&gt; while both [[José Argüelles]] (in ''The Transformative Vision'')&lt;ref name="elles1975" /&gt; and [[Terence McKenna]] (in ''The Invisible Landscape'')&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mckenna1993" /&gt; discussed the significance of the year 2012 without mentioning a specific day.

In 1983, with the publication of [[Robert J. Sharer]]'s revised table of date correlations in the 4th edition of Morley's ''The Ancient Maya,''{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} each became convinced that 21 December 2012 had significant meaning. By 1987, the year in which he organized the [[Harmonic Convergence]] event, Arguelles was using the date 21 December 2012 in ''The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology''.&lt;ref name="Planets Won't Attend Astronomical Celebration" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elles1987" /&gt; He claimed that on 13 August 3113 BC the Earth began a passage through a "galactic synchronization beam" that emanated from the [[Galactic Center|center of our galaxy]], that it would pass through this beam during a period of 5200 ''tuns'' (Maya cycles of 360 days each), and that this beam would result in "total synchronization" and "galactic entrainment" of individuals "plugged into the Earth's electromagnetic battery" by 13.0.0.0.0 (21 December 2012). He believed that the Maya aligned their calendar to correspond to this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="scare" /&gt; Anthony Aveni has dismissed all of these ideas.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|pp=17–27}}

In 2006, author [[Daniel Pinchbeck]] popularized New Age concepts about this date in his book ''2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl'', linking b'ak'tun 13 to beliefs in [[crop circles]], [[alien abduction]], and personal revelations based on the use of [[hallucinogenic drugs]] and [[mediumship]].&lt;ref name="Pinchbeck 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The End of the World As They Know It" /&gt; Pinchbeck claims to discern a "growing realization that materialism and the rational, empirical worldview that comes with it has reached its expiration date&amp;nbsp;... [w]e're on the verge of transitioning to a dispensation of consciousness that's more intuitive, mystical and shamanic".&lt;ref name="anasatas" /&gt;

=== Galactic alignment ===
There is no significant astronomical event tied to the Long Count's start date.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=83}} However, its supposed end date was tied to astronomical phenomena by [[esoteric]], [[fringe science|fringe]], and [[New Age]] literature that placed great significance on [[astrology]], especially astrological interpretations associated with the phenomenon of [[axial precession]].&lt;ref name="Hoopes2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoopes2012" /&gt; Chief among these ideas is the astrological concept of a "galactic alignment".

==== Precession ====
In the [[Solar System]], the planets and the [[Sun]] lie roughly within the same flat plane, known as the [[plane of the ecliptic]]. From our perspective on [[Earth]], the [[ecliptic]] is the path taken by the Sun across the sky over the course of the year. The twelve [[constellation]]s that line the ecliptic are known as the [[zodiac]]al constellations and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called "[[Precession of the equinoxes|precession]]", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a [[spinning top]] wobbles as it slows down.&lt;ref name="prec" /&gt; Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a [[Great Year]], the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree backward rotation through the zodiac.&lt;ref name="prec" /&gt; In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the [[March equinox]], one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, the Sun's March equinox position was in the constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] moving back into [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. This signaled the end of one [[astrological age]] (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the [[Age of Aquarius]]).{{sfn|Spencer|2000|pp=115–127}}

Similarly, the Sun's December [[solstice]] position (in the northern hemisphere, the lowest point on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name="Teapot of Sagittarius points to galactic center" /&gt; Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from the surface of the Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it.&lt;ref name="What's going to happen on 21 December 2012?" /&gt; In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the [[galactic equator]].&lt;ref name="starry" /&gt; In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.&lt;ref name="Questions and comments" /&gt;

==== Mysticism ====
[[File:Milkyway Swan Panorama.jpg|thumb|400px|The Milky Way near [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] showing the lane of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Dark Rift]], which the Maya called the ''Xibalba be'' or "Black Road"|alt=a photograph of the Milky Way, rotated 90 degrees]]

Mystical speculations about the [[precession]] of the equinoxes and the Sun's proximity to the center of the Milky Way appeared in ''[[Hamlet's Mill]]'' (1969) by [[Giorgio de Santillana]] and Hertha von Deschend. These were quoted and expanded upon by [[Terence McKenna|Terence]] and [[Dennis McKenna]] in ''The Invisible Landscape'' (1975). 

Adherents to the idea, following a theory first proposed by [[Munro Edmonson]],{{sfn|Edmonson|1988|p=119}} alleged that the Maya based their calendar on observations of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Great Rift]] or Dark Rift, a band of dark dust clouds in the Milky Way, which, according to some scholars, the Maya called the ''[[Xibalba|Xibalba be]]'' or "Black Road".&lt;ref name="Xibalba or Xibalbe" /&gt; John Major Jenkins claims that the Maya were aware of where the ecliptic intersected the Black Road and gave this position in the sky a special significance in their cosmology.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2012" /&gt; Jenkins said that precession would align the Sun precisely with the galactic equator at the 2012 winter solstice.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2012" /&gt; Jenkins claimed that the classical Maya anticipated this conjunction and celebrated it as the harbinger of a profound spiritual transition for mankind.&lt;ref name="The Mayan Calendar and the Transformation of Consciousness" /&gt; New Age proponents of the galactic alignment hypothesis argued that, just as astrology uses the positions of stars and planets to make claims of future events, the Maya plotted their calendars with the objective of preparing for significant world events.&lt;ref name="pinchbeck2006" /&gt; Jenkins attributed the insights of ancient Maya [[shamans]] about the [[galactic center]] to their use of [[psilocybin mushrooms]], [[psychoactive toad]]s, and other [[psychedelics]].&lt;ref name="jenkins1998" /&gt; Jenkins also associated the ''Xibalba be'' with a "world tree", drawing on studies of contemporary (not ancient) Maya cosmology.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=62}}

==== Criticism ====
Astronomers such as [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] argue that the galactic equator is an entirely arbitrary line and can never be precisely drawn, because it is impossible to determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above {{convert|11000|ft|m}}, an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to.&lt;ref name="scare" /&gt; Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.&lt;ref name="jenk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The True Alignment Zone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="meeus1997" /&gt;

There is no clear evidence that the classic Maya were aware of precession. Some Maya scholars, such as Barbara MacLeod,{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} Michael Grofe,&lt;ref name="grofe2011" /&gt; Eva Hunt, Gordon Brotherston, and Anthony Aveni,&lt;ref name="jenkins2009" /&gt; have suggested that some Mayan holy dates were timed to precessional cycles, but scholarly opinion on the subject remains divided.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt; There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on solstices or equinoxes.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aimers, J. J., and Rice, P. M. 2006 79–96" /&gt; It is possible that only the earliest among Mesoamericans observed solstices,{{refn|{{harvnb|Aveni|2009|pp=54–55}}, citing {{harvnb|Aveni|Hartung|2000}}.}} but this is also a disputed issue among Mayanists.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aimers, J. J., and Rice, P. M. 2006 79–96" /&gt; There is also no evidence that the classic Maya attached any importance to the Milky Way; there is no glyph in their writing system to represent it, and no astronomical or chronological table tied to it.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=57}}

=== Timewave zero and the ''I Ching'' ===
{{Main|Terence McKenna#Novelty theory and Timewave Zero}}
[[File:Timewave 9 11 2001.png|thumb|A screenshot of the "Timewave Zero" software|alt=a greyscale graph with multiple, jagged peaks and troughs and an overall descending pattern, set amidst complex virtual instrumentation]]
"Timewave zero" is a [[numerology|numerological]] formula that purports to calculate the ebb and flow of "novelty", defined as increase over time in the [[universe]]'s interconnectedness, or [[Complexity#Disorganized complexity vs. organized complexity|organized complexity]].&lt;ref name="TMobAB" /&gt; [[Terence McKenna]] claimed that the universe has a [[teleological]] [[attractor]] at the [[Ultimate fate of the universe|end of time]] that increases interconnectedness. He believed this which would eventually reach a [[technological singularity|singularity]] of infinite complexity in 2012, at which point anything and everything imaginable would occur simultaneously. He conceived this idea over several years in the early to mid-1970s whilst using psilocybin mushrooms and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]].&lt;ref name="TMobAB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitesides2012" /&gt; The [[scientific community]] considers novelty theory to be [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name=bruce&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=A. |year=2009 |title=2012: Science Or Superstition (the Definitive Guide to the Doomsday Phenomenon) |publisher=The Disinformation Company |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-rVUCO4YyYC&amp;pg=PA261|isbn=978-1-934708-51-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=normark&gt;{{cite web |title=2012: Prophet of nonsense #8: Terence McKenna – Novelty theory and timewave zero |last=Normark |first=Johan |url=http://haecceities.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/2012-prophet-of-nonsense-8-terence-mckenna%E2%80%93-novelty-theory-and-timewave-zero/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKenna expressed "novelty" in a computer program which produces a waveform known as "timewave zero" or the "timewave". Based on McKenna's interpretation of the [[King Wen sequence]] of the ''[[I Ching]]'', an ancient Chinese book on [[divination]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; the graph purports to show great periods of novelty corresponding with major shifts in humanity's [[evolution|biological]] and [[sociocultural evolution|sociocultural]] evolution. He believed that the events of any given time are resonantly related to the events of other times, and chose the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]] as the basis for calculating his end date of November 2012.&lt;ref name="Dynamics of Hyperspace" /&gt; When he later discovered this date's proximity to the end of the 13th b'ak'tun of the Maya calendar, he revised his hypothesis so that the two dates matched.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt;

The 1975 first edition of ''The Invisible Landscape'' referred to 2012 (but no specific day during the year) only twice. In the 1993 second edition, McKenna employed Sharer's date{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} of 21 December 2012 throughout.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitesides2012" /&gt;

Novelty theory has been criticized for "rejecting countless ideas presumed as factual by the scientific community", depending "solely on numerous controversial deductions that contradict empirical logic", and encompassing "no suitable indication of truth", with the conclusion that novelty theory is a pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Smith II D.

The idea that the year 2012 presaged a world cataclysm, the end of the world, or the end of [[human civilization]], became a subject of popular media speculation as the date of 21 December 2012 approached. This idea was promulgated by many pages on the [[Internet]], particularly on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; [[The Discovery Channel]] was criticized for its "quasi-documentaries" about the subject that "sacrifice[d] accuracy for entertainment".&lt;ref name="PressSunBulletin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pressconnects.com/article/20121210/NEWS01/312110007/Cornell-Maya-expert-World-probably-won-t-end-Dec-21?odyssey=nav%7Chead|title=Cornell Maya expert: World probably won't end Dec. 21 |last=D.W.

=== Other alignments ===
Some people interpreted the galactic alignment apocalyptically, claiming that its occurrence would somehow create a combined [[gravitation]]al effect between the Sun and the [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of our galaxy (known as [[Sagittarius A*]]), creating havoc on Earth.&lt;ref name="krupp" /&gt; Apart from the "galactic alignment" already having happened in 1998, the Sun's apparent path through the zodiac as seen from Earth did not take it near the true galactic center, but rather several degrees above it.&lt;ref name="starry" /&gt; Even were this not the case, Sagittarius A* is 30,000 [[light year]]s from Earth; it would have to have been more than 6 million times closer to cause any gravitational disruption to Earth's Solar System.&lt;ref name="Questions answered" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What would happen if a supermassive black hole came close to the Earth?" /&gt; This reading of the alignment was included on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] documentary ''Decoding the Past''. John Major Jenkins complained that a science fiction writer co-authored the documentary, and he went on to characterize it as "45&amp;nbsp;minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the worst kind of inane sensationalism".&lt;ref name="How Not to Make a 2012 Documentary" /&gt;

Some believers in a 2012 doomsday used the term "galactic alignment" to describe a different phenomenon proposed by some scientists to explain a pattern in [[mass extinction]]s supposedly observed in the [[fossil record]].&lt;ref name="fraser" /&gt; According to the [[Shiva Hypothesis]], mass extinctions are not random, but recur every 26 million years. To account for this, it was suggested that vertical oscillations made by the Sun on its [[Galactic year|250-million-year orbit]] of the galactic center cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic plane which bisects the [[galactic disc]], the influence of the [[galactic tide]] is weaker. However, when re-entering the galactic disc—as it does every 20–25&amp;nbsp;million years—it comes under the influence of the far stronger "disc tides", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of [[Oort cloud]] comets into the inner Solar System by a factor of 4, thus leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating comet impact.&lt;ref name="Perturbing the Oort Cloud" /&gt; However, this "alignment" takes place over tens of millions of years, and could never be timed to an exact date.&lt;ref name="Galactic Plane" /&gt; Evidence shows that the Sun passed through the plane bisecting the galactic disc three million years ago and in 2012 was moving farther above it.&lt;ref name="The Sun's motion perpendicular to the galactic plane" /&gt;

A third suggested alignment was some sort of planetary [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] occurring on 21 December 2012; however, there was no conjunction on that date.&lt;ref name="Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers" /&gt; Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth.&lt;ref name="Planetary Alignment" /&gt; [[Jupiter]] is the [[List of Solar System objects by size#Objects above ≈300&amp;nbsp;km in radius|largest]] planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined. When Jupiter is near [[Opposition (planets)|opposition]], the difference in gravitational force that the Earth experiences is less than 1% of the force that the Earth feels daily from the Moon.&lt;ref name="Plait-alignment" /&gt;

=== Geomagnetic reversal ===
Another idea tied to 2012 involved a [[geomagnetic reversal]] (often referred to as a [[pole shift]] by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive [[solar flare]], that would release an energy equal to 100&amp;nbsp;billion [[atomic bombs]].&lt;ref name="2012: No Killer Solar Flare" /&gt; This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's [[magnetic field]] was weakening,&lt;ref name="Rapidly changing flows in the Earth's core" /&gt; which could precede a reversal of the north and south [[Poles of astronomical bodies|magnetic poles]], and the arrival of the next [[solar maximum]], which was expected sometime around 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Storm Warning|publisher=NASA|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/10mar_stormwarning/|year=2006|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scientific estimates, however, say that geomagnetic reversals take between 1,000 and 10,000 years to complete,&lt;ref name="Merrill"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Merrill | first1 = Ronald T. | last2 = McElhinny | first2 = Michael W. | last3 = McFadden | first3 = Philip L. | title = The magnetic field of the earth: paleomagnetism, the core, and the deep mantle|publisher=[[Academic Press]] | year = 1998|isbn=978-0-12-491246-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not start on any particular date.&lt;ref name="Geomagnetic Reversal" /&gt; Furthermore, the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] predicted that the solar maximum would peak in late 2013 or 2014, and that it would be fairly weak, with a below-average number of [[sunspots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Maximum: Three Solar Flares And A Coronal Mass Ejection As The Sun Reaches Peak Solar Activity|publisher=NASA|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/solar-maximum-three-solar-flares-coronal-mass-ejection-sun-reaches-peak-solar-activity-1442608|year=2013|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, there was no scientific evidence linking a solar maximum to a geomagnetic reversal, which is driven by forces entirely within the Earth.&lt;ref name="2012: No Geomagnetic Reversal" /&gt; Instead, a solar maximum would be mostly notable for its effects on satellite and cellular phone communications.&lt;ref name="goemag" /&gt; David Morrison attributed the rise of the solar storm idea to physicist and science popularizer [[Michio Kaku]], who claimed in an interview with [[Fox News]] that a solar peak in 2012 could be disastrous for orbiting satellites, and to NASA's headlining a 2006 webpage as "Solar Storm Warning", a term later repeated on several doomsday pages.&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt;

=== Planet X/Nibiru ===
{{main|Nibiru cataclysm}}

Some believers in a 2012 doomsday claimed that a planet called Planet&amp;nbsp;X, or Nibiru, would collide with or pass by the Earth. This idea, which appeared in various forms since 1995, initially predicted Doomsday in May 2003, but proponents abandoned that date after it passed without incident.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt; The idea originated from claims of channeling [[grey aliens|alien beings]] and is widely ridiculed.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt;{{sfn|Schilling|2008|p=111}} Astronomers calculated that such an object so close to Earth would be visible to anyone looking up at the night sky.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt;

=== Other catastrophes ===
[[File:Pleiades large.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pleiades]], a [[star cluster]] with supposed influence sometimes tied to the 2012 event|alt=The Pleiades star cluster]]

Author [[Graham Hancock]], in his book ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'', interpreted Coe's remarks in ''Breaking the Maya Code''{{sfn|Coe|1992|pp=275–276}} as evidence for the prophecy of a global cataclysm.&lt;ref name="hancock" /&gt; Filmmaker [[Roland Emmerich]] later credited the book with inspiring his 2009 [[disaster film]] ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]''.&lt;ref name="chicagoscifi credits"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://chicagoscifi.com/movies/0011/presskit_pages/credits.pdf | title = 2012 (2009)&amp;nbsp;– Credit List |accessdate=25 November 2009 |publisher=chicagoscifi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other speculations regarding doomsday in 2012 included predictions by the [[Web Bot]] project, a computer program that purports to predict the future by analyzing Internet chatter. However, commentators have rejected claims that the bot is able to predict natural disasters, as opposed to human-caused disasters like stock market crashes.&lt;ref name="'Web-bot project' makes prophecy of 2012 apocalypse" /&gt;

The 2012 date was also loosely tied to the long-running concept of the [[Photon Belt]], which predicted a form of interaction between Earth and [[Alcyone (star)|Alcyone]], the largest star of the [[Pleiades cluster]].&lt;ref name="morris2" /&gt; Critics argued that photons cannot form belts, that the Pleiades, located more than 400 light years away, could have no effect on Earth, and that the Solar System, rather than getting closer to the Pleiades, was in fact moving farther away from it.&lt;ref name="Is the earth about to enter the Photon Belt, causing the end of life as we know it?" /&gt;

Some media outlets tied the fact that the [[red supergiant]] star [[Betelgeuse]] would undergo a [[supernova]] at some point in the future to the 2012 phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Connelly 19 January 2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/sci-tech/tatooines-twin-suns-coming-to-a-planet-near-you-just-as-soon-as-betelgeuse-explodes/story-fn5fsgyc-1225991009247 |title=Tatooine's twin suns&amp;nbsp;– coming to a planet near you just as soon as Betelgeuse explodes |last=Connelly |first=Claire |work=News.com.au |date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=14 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922083805/http://www.news.com.au/technology/sci-tech/tatooines-twin-suns-coming-to-a-planet-near-you-just-as-soon-as-betelgeuse-explodes/story-fn5fsgyc-1225991009247 |archivedate=22 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Betelgeuse was certainly in the final stages of its life, and would die as a supernova, there was no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years.&lt;ref name="Betelgeuse and 2012" /&gt; To be a threat to Earth, a supernova would need to be no further than 25 light years from the Solar System. Betelgeuse is roughly 600 light years away, and so its supernova would not affect Earth.&lt;ref name="Is Betelgeuse about to blow?" /&gt; In December 2011, NASA's [[Francis Reddy]] issued a press release debunking the possibility of a supernova occurring in 2012.&lt;ref name="Reddy 2011"&gt;{{cite web | title = 2012: Fear No Supernova | publisher = NASA | last = Reddy | first = Francis | url = http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012-supernova.html | year = 2011 | accessdate = 23 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another claim involved [[alien invasion]]. In December 2010, an article, first published in [[examiner.com]] and later referenced in the English-language edition of ''[[Pravda]]''&lt;ref name="NO Spaceships Headed for Earth" /&gt; claimed, citing a Second [[Digitized Sky Survey]] photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012.&lt;ref name="philp" /&gt; Astronomer and debunker [[Phil Plait]] noted that by using the [[small-angle formula]], one could determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, it would have had to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived.&lt;ref name="philp" /&gt; In January 2011, [[Seth Shostak]], chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.&lt;ref name="NO Spaceships Headed for Earth" /&gt;

Beginning in 2000, the small French village of [[Bugarach]], population 189, began receiving visits from "esoterics"—mystic believers who had concluded that the local mountain, [[Pic de Bugarach]], was the ideal location to weather the transformative events of 2012. In 2011, the local mayor, Jean-Pierre Delord, began voicing fears to the international press that the small town would be overwhelmed by an influx of thousands of visitors in 2012, even suggesting he might call in the army.&lt;ref name="For End of the World, a French Peak Holds Allure" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Samuel 2010" /&gt; "We've seen a huge rise in visitors", Delord told ''[[The Independent]]'' in March 2012. "Already this year more than 20,000 people have climbed right to the top, and last year we had 10,000 hikers, which was a significant rise on the previous 12 months. They think Pic de Bugarach is 'un garage à ovnis' [a garage for [[UFO]]s]. The villagers are exasperated: the exaggerated importance of something which they see as completely removed from reality is bewildering. After 21 December, this will surely return to normal."&lt;ref name=hippies /&gt; In December 2012, the French government placed 100 police and firefighters around both Bugarach and Pic de Bugarach, limiting access to potential visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayan Doomsday: French Police Block Access to Survivors' Refuge Pic de Bugarach|author=Hanna Osborne|publisher=International Business Times|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/407669/20121122/mayan-prophecy-doomsday-pic-de-bugarach-aliens.htm|accessdate=13 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129090241/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/407669/20121122/mayan-prophecy-doomsday-pic-de-bugarach-aliens.htm|archivedate=29 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, only about 1,000 visitors appeared at the height of the "event".

== Cultural influence ==
The 2012 phenomenon was discussed or referenced in several media. Several TV documentaries, as well as some contemporary fictional references to the year 2012, referred to 21 December as the day of a cataclysmic event.

The [[UFO conspiracy]] TV series ''[[The X-Files]]'' cited 22 December 2012 as the date for an alien colonization of the Earth and mentioned the [[Mayan calendar]] "stopping" on this date.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt; The [[History (U.S. TV network)|History Channel]] aired a handful of special series on doomsday that included analysis of 2012 theories, such as ''[[Decoding the Past]]'' (2005–2007), ''2012, End of Days'' (2006), ''[[Last Days on Earth]]'' (2006), ''Seven Signs of the Apocalypse'' (2009), and ''Nostradamus 2012'' (2008).&lt;ref name="Armageddon series" /&gt; The [[Discovery Channel]] also aired ''2012 Apocalypse'' in 2009, suggesting that massive [[Geomagnetic storm|solar storms]], [[magnetic pole reversal]], earthquakes, [[supervolcano]]es, and other drastic natural events could occur in 2012.&lt;ref name="2012 Apocalypse" /&gt; In 2012, the [[National Geographic (U.S. TV channel)|National Geographic Channel]] launched a show called ''[[Doomsday Preppers]]'', a documentary series about [[survivalism|survivalists]] preparing for various cataclysms, including the 2012 doomsday.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic Doomsday Preppers"&gt;{{cite web | title = Doomsday Preppers | work = National Geographic | url = http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/doomsday-preppers/ | accessdate = 6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of books were published on the topic.&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; The bestselling book of 2009,&lt;ref name="Best-Selling Books of 2009" /&gt; [[Dan Brown]]'s ''[[The Lost Symbol]]'', featured a coded mock email number (2456282.5) that decoded to the [[Julian date]] for 21 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Secrets of The Lost Symbol|author1=Dan Bernstein |author2=Arne de Kiuzer |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qgqfqUjF_38C&amp;pg=PT35&amp;lpg=PT35&amp;dq=2456282.5+julian+date+%22lost+symbol%22|accessdate=19 December 2012|isbn=978-0-297-86060-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cinema, the 2009 disaster film ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]'' was inspired by the phenomenon, and advance promotion prior to its release included a [[stealth marketing]] campaign in which TV spots and websites from the fictional "Institute for Human Continuity" called on people to prepare for the end of the world. As these promotions did not mention the film itself, many viewers believed them to be real and contacted astronomers in panic.&lt;ref name="sony" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Relax, the end isn't nigh" /&gt; Although the campaign was heavily criticized,&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; the film became one of the most successful of its year, grossing nearly $770&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.&lt;ref name="2009 Worldwide Grosses" /&gt; An article in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' attributed the widespread fear of the 2012 phenomenon in China to the film, which was a smash hit in that country because it depicted the Chinese building "survival arks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China fears end of the world is nigh|author=Malcolm Moore|work=The Daily Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9729270/China-fears-end-of-the-world-is-nigh.html| accessdate=11 December 2012|location=London|date=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lars von Trier]]'s 2011 film ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]'' featured a plot in which a planet emerges from behind the Sun on a collision course with Earth.&lt;ref name="Sunny Kirsten Dunst is picture perfect at the Cannes photocall for her provocative new film Melancholia" /&gt; Announcing his company's purchase of the film, the head of [[Magnolia Pictures]] said in a press release, "As the 2012 apocalypse is upon us, it is time to prepare for a cinematic last supper".&lt;ref name="Magnolia Picks Up North American Rights to Lars von Trier's 'Melancholia'" /&gt;

The phenomenon also inspired several rock and pop music hits. As early as 1997, "[[A Certain Shade of Green]]" by [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] referred to the mystical belief that a shift in perception would arrive in 2012 ("Are you gonna stand around till 2012 A.D.? / What are you waiting for, a certain shade of green?"). More recent hits include "[[2012 (It Ain't the End)]]" (2010) performed by [[Jay Sean]] and "[[Till the World Ends]]" (2011) performed by [[Britney Spears]]. Towards mid-December 2012, an internet [[hoax]] related to South Korean singer [[Psy]] being one of the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] was widely circulated around social media platforms. The hoax purported that once Psy's "[[Gangnam Style]]" YouTube video amassed a billion views, the world would end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnist/much-ado-about-apocalypse-1.188870 |newspaper=[[New Straits Times]] |title=Much ado about apocalypse |first=Chok |last=Suat Ling |date=20 December 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104174754/http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnist/much-ado-about-apocalypse-1.188870 |archivedate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian composer [[A.

A number of brands ran commercials tied to the 2012 apocalypse in the months and days leading to the date. In February 2012, American automotive company [[General Motors]] aired an advertisement during the annual [[Super Bowl]] [[American football|football game]] in which a group of friends drove [[Chevrolet Silverado]]s through the ruins of human civilization following the 2012 apocalypse, while on 17 December 2012, [[Jell-O]] ran an ad saying that offering Jell-O to the Mayan gods would appease them into sparing the world. John Verret, Professor of Advertising at [[Boston University]], questioned the utility of tying large sums of money to such a unique and short-term event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wong |first=Vanessa |title=Brands Capitalize on 'Impending Apocalypse' |publisher=BusinessWeek |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-12-19/brands-capitalizing-on-the-impending-apocalypse|date=19 December 2012|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==
{{Refbegin|30em}}
* {{note label|A|a|a}} The [[13 (number)|number 13]] plays an important role in Mesoamerican calendrics; the ''[[tzolk'in]]'', or sacred calendar, was divided into 13 months of 20 days each. The Mayan ''may'' cycle consisted of 13 k'atuns. The reason for the number's importance is uncertain, though correlations to the phases of the moon and to the human gestation period have been suggested.{{sfn|Rice|2007|pp=44, 59}}&lt;ref name="The Origin of the 260-day calendar: the gestation hypothesis reconsidered in light of its use among the Quiche Maya" /&gt;
* {{note label|B|b|b}} The Mayan calendar, unlike the Western calendar, used a zero.&lt;ref name="joyce" /&gt;
* {{note label|C|c|c}} Rather than "0.0.0.0.0", the Mayan Long Count represented the date of creation as "13.0.0.0.0"&lt;ref name=wagner/&gt;
* {{note label|D|d|d}} Most Mayanist scholars, such as [[Mark Van Stone]] and Anthony Aveni, adhere to the "GMT (Goodman-Martinez-Thompson) correlation" with the Long Count, which places the start date at 11 August 3114&amp;nbsp;BC and the end date of b'ak'tun 13 at 21 December 2012.&lt;ref name="Who's Who in the Maya World" /&gt; This date was also the overwhelming preference of those who believed in 2012 eschatology, arguably, Van Stone suggests, because it was a solstice, and was thus astrologically significant. Some Mayanist scholars, such as Michael D. Coe, Linda Schele and [[Marc Zender]], adhere to the "Lounsbury/GMT+2" correlation, which sets the start date at 13 August and the end date at 23 December. Which of these is the precise correlation has yet to be conclusively settled.&lt;ref name="Questions and comments" /&gt;
* {{note label|E|e|e}} Coe's initial date was "24 December 2011". He revised it to "11 January AD 2013" in the 1980 2nd edition of his book,{{sfn|Coe|1980|p=151}} not settling on 23 December 2012 until the 1984 3rd edition.{{refn|{{harvnb|Coe|1984}}. This correlation, which differs two days from Sharer's, is repeated in subsequent editions of Coe's book.}} The correlation of b'ak'tun 13 as 21 December 2012 first appeared in Table B.2 of Robert J. Sharer's 1983 revision of the 4th edition of Sylvanus Morley's book ''The Ancient Maya'' {{harv|Morley|1983|p=603|loc=Table B2}}.

[[Attic Greek]] ἄγνωτος "unknown"&lt;ref&gt;See: [[wikt:ἄγνωτος|Wiktionary entry on ἄγνωτος]].&lt;/ref&gt;), and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]''.&lt;ref name=Palmer&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/2005/pr-agno-100505.html |title= Conference to explore the social construction of ignorance |accessdate= 2007-08-12|date= 2005-10-04|first= Barbara |last= Palmer|publisher= Stanford News Service |quote= Proctor uses the term "agnotology" – a word coined from agnosis, meaning "not knowing" – to describe a new approach to looking at knowledge through the study of ignorance.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070724074303/http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/2005/pr-agno-100505.html| archivedate= 24 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, the term also highlights the increasingly common condition where more knowledge of a subject leaves one more uncertain than before.  [[David Dunning]] of Cornell University is another academic who studies the spread of ignorance.  "Dunning warns that the internet is helping propagate ignorance – it is a place where everyone has a chance to be their own expert, he says, which makes them prey for powerful interests wishing to deliberately spread ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160105-the-man-who-studies-the-spread-of-ignorance |title= The Man Who Studies the Spread of Ignorance|last=Kenyon|first= Georgina|date= |website= |publisher= BBC|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1999 book ''The Erotic Margin'', Irvin C. Schick referred to ''unknowledge'' "to distinguish it from ignorance, and to denote socially constructed lack of knowledge, that is, a conscious absence of socially pertinent knowledge". As an example, he offered the labeling "terra incognita" in early maps, noting that "The reconstruction of parts of the globe as uncharted territory is ... the ''production of unknowledge'', the transformation of those parts into potential objects of Western political and economic attention. It is the enabling of colonialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schick |first=Irvin C. |title=The Erotic Margin: Sexuality and Spatiality in Alteritist Discourse |publisher=Verso |location=New York and London |year=1999 |pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many causes of culturally induced [[ignorance]]. These include the influence of the [[media (communication)|media]], either through neglect or as a result of deliberate misrepresentation and manipulation. [[Corporation]]s and governmental agencies can contribute to the subject matter studied by agnotology through [[secrecy]] and [[Censorship|suppression]] of information, document destruction, and myriad forms of inherent or avoidable culturopolitical selectivity, inattention, and forgetfulness.&lt;ref name=2005conf/&gt;

Proctor cites as a prime example of the deliberate production of ignorance the [[tobacco industry]]'s [[Tobacco advertising|advertising]] campaign to [[Merchants of Doubt|manufacture doubt]] about the [[cancer]]ous and other [[Health effects of tobacco|health effects]] of [[tobacco use]]. Under the banner of science, the industry produced research about everything except tobacco hazards to exploit public uncertainty.&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

At Stanford, we study how ignorance is manufactured. It is an art we call agnotology.)
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnotology also focuses on how and why diverse forms of knowledge do ''not'' "come to be", or are ignored or delayed. For example, knowledge about [[plate tectonics]] was [[censorship|censored]] and delayed for at least a decade because some evidence remained [[classified information|classified military information]] related to [[Submarine warfare|undersea warfare]].&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
The term "agnotology" was first coined in a footnote in Proctor's 1995 book, ''The Cancer Wars: How Politics Shapes What We Know and Don't Know About Cancer'': "Historians and philosophers of science have tended to treat ignorance as an ever-expanding vacuum into which knowledge is sucked – or even, as [[Johannes Kepler]] once put it, as the mother who must die for [[science]] to be born. Ignorance, though, is more complex than this. It has a distinct and changing political geography that is often an excellent indicator of the politics of knowledge. We need a political agnotology to complement our political epistemologies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proctor |first=Robert |title=The Cancer Wars: How Politics Shapes What We Know and Don't Know About Cancer |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1995 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proctor was quoted using the term to describe his research "only half jokingly", as "agnotology" in a 2001 interview about his [[lapidary]] work with the colorful rock [[agate]]. He connected the two seemingly unrelated topics by noting the lack of [[geology|geologic]] knowledge and study of agate since its first known description by [[Theophrastus]] in 300 BC, relative to the extensive research on other rocks and minerals such as [[diamond]]s, [[asbestos]], [[granite]], and [[coal]], all of which have much higher commercial value. He said agate was a "victim of scientific disinterest", the same "structured apathy" he called "the social construction of ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rps.psu.edu/0109/agateer.html |title=The Agateer |accessdate=2007-08-12 |work=Research Penn State|first=Nancy Marie |last=Brown|date=September 2001| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070811131237/http://www.rps.psu.edu/0109/agateer.html| archivedate= 11 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was later quoted as calling it "agnotology, the study of ignorance", in a 2003 ''[[The New York Times]]'' story on medical historians testifying as [[expert witness]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/14/arts/14HIST.html?ex=1371009600&amp;en=e10e0387e68ab30f&amp;ei=5007 |title=History for Hire in Industry Lawsuits|date=2003-06-14 |accessdate=2014-07-15 |author =Cohen, Patricia |work=[[The New York Times]]|quote=Mr. Proctor, who describes his specialty as "agnotology, the study of ignorance", argues that the tobacco industry has tried to give the impression that the hazards of cigarette smoking are still an open question even when the scientific evidence is indisputable. "The tobacco industry is famous for having seen itself as a manufacturer of two different products," he said, "tobacco and doubt".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proctor co-organized a pair of events with [[Londa Schiebinger]], his wife, who is also a science history professor: the first was a workshop at the [[Pennsylvania State University]] in 2003 titled "Agnatology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bshs.org.uk/agnatology-the-cultural-production-of-ignorance |website=The British Society for the History of Science |title=Agnatology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance |accessdate=2014-07-15 |quote=Science, Medicine, and Technology in Culture Pennsylvania University Presents a Workshop: ... Robert N. Proctor and Londa Schiebinger, co-organizers}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later a conference at [[Stanford University]] in 2005 titled "Agnotology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance".&lt;ref name=2005conf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPST/AgnotologyConference.html |title= Agnotology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance|accessdate=2007-08-12 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political economy===

In 2004, [[Londa Schiebinger]]&lt;ref name="news-service.stanford.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/october13/londa-1013.html |title=IRWG director hopes to create 'go to' center for gender studies |accessdate=2007-08-12 |date=2004-10-13 |work=Stanford News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;
gave a more precise definition of agnotology in a paper on 18th-century voyages of scientific discovery and gender relations, and contrasted it with [[epistemology]], the theory of knowledge, saying that the latter questions how we know while the former questions why we do not know: "Ignorance is often not merely the absence of knowledge but an outcome of cultural and political struggle".&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2004&gt;{{cite journal

Ignorance is often not merely the absence of knowledge but an outcome of the cultural and political struggle.

Its use as a critical description of the political economy has been expanded upon by [[Michael Betancourt]] in a 2010 article titled "Immaterial Value and Scarcity in Digital Capitalism"&lt;ref name="Betancourt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=652 |title=CTheory |accessdate=2010-09-06 |quote="Immaterial Value and Scarcity in Digital Capitalism", CTheory, Theory Beyond the Codes: tbc002, Date Published: 6/10/2010, Arthur and Marilouise Kroker, Editors| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101005143051/http://ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=652| archivedate= 5 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded in the book ''The Critique of Digital Capitalism''.&lt;ref name="Betancourt2"&gt;{{cite book | last=Betancourt |first=Michael | authorlink = Michael Betancourt | title = [[The Critique of Digital Capitalism]]: An Analysis of the Political Economy of Digital Culture and Technology | publisher = [[Punctum Books]] | location = Brooklyn | year = 2016 | ISBN = 978-0692598443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His analysis is focused on the housing bubble as well as the bubble economy of the period from 1980 to 2008. Betancourt argues that this political economy should be termed "agnotologic capitalism" because the systemic production and maintenance of ignorance is a major feature that enables the economy to function as it allows the creation of a "bubble economy".&lt;ref name="news-service.stanford.edu"/&gt;

Betancourt's argument is posed in relation to the idea of [[affective labor]]. He states that &lt;blockquote&gt;The creation of systemic unknowns where any potential "fact" is always already countered by an alternative of apparently equal weight and value renders engagement with the conditions of reality – the very situations affective labor seeks to assuage – contentious and a source of confusion, reflected by the inability of participants in bubbles to be aware of the imminent collapse until after it has happened. The biopolitical paradigm of distraction, what [Juan Martin] Prada calls "life to enjoy", can only be maintained if the underlying strictures remain hidden from view. If affective labor works to reduce alienation, agnotology works to eliminate the potential for dissent.&lt;ref name="Betancourt"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his view, the role of affective labor is to enable the continuation of the agnotologic effects that enable the maintenance of the capitalist status quo.

==Agnoiology==

A similar word from the same Greek roots, ''agnoiology'', meaning "the science or study of ignorance, which determines its quality and conditions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Agnoiology|volume=1|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the doctrine concerning those things of which we are necessarily ignorant"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |editor= Porter, Noah | publisher= G &amp; C. Merriam Co.| year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes a branch of philosophy studied by [[James Frederick Ferrier]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9002832/James-Frederick-Ferrier |title=James Frederick Ferrier |accessdate=2007-08-12 |format= |work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ainigmology ==
Anthropologist Glenn Stone points out that most of the examples of agnotology (such as work promoting tobacco use) do not actually create a lack of knowledge so much as they create confusion.  A more accurate term for such writing would be "ainigmology", from the root ''ainigma'' (as in "enigma"); in Greek this refers to riddles or to language that obscures the true meaning of a story.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Glenn Davis 2014 Biosecurity in the Age of Genetic Engineering. In '''[http://pages.wustl.edu/files/pages/imce/stone/stone_2014_bioinsecurity.pdf Bioinsecurity and Human Vulnerability]''', ed Nancy Chen and Lesley Sharp, pp. 71-86.  Santa Fe: SAR Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media influence ==

The availability of such large amounts of knowledge in this information age may not necessarily be producing a knowledgeable citizenry. Instead it may be allowing many people to cherry-pick information in blogs or news that reinforces their existing beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| title=Study: Americans choose media messages that agree with their views

| pages=426–448}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and to be distracted from new knowledge by repetitive or base entertainments. There is conflicting evidence on how television viewing affects intelligence as well as values formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

An emerging new scientific discipline that has connections to agnotology is [[cognitronics]]:
;cognitronics : aims (a) at explicating the distortions in the perception of the world caused by the information society and globalization and (b) at coping with these distortions in different fields. Cognitronics is studying and looking for the ways of improving cognitive mechanisms of processing information and developing emotional sphere of the personality - the ways aiming at compensating three mentioned shifts in the systems of values and, as an indirect consequence, for the ways of developing symbolic information processing skills of the learners, linguistic mechanisms, associative and reasoning abilities, broad mental outlook being important preconditions of successful work practically in every sphere of professional activity in information society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14991">'''Astronomical radio sources''' are objects in [[outer space]] that emit strong [[radio waves]]. Radio emission comes from a wide variety of sources. Such objects represent some of the most extreme and energetic physical processes in the universe.

==History==
In 1932, American [[physicist]] and [[radio]] [[engineer]] [[Karl Jansky]] detected [[radio waves]] coming from an unknown source in the center of our [[galaxy]]. Jansky was studying the origins of radio frequency interference for [[Bell Laboratories]].  He found "...a steady hiss type static of unknown origin", which eventually he concluded had an extraterrestrial origin. This was the first time that radio waves were detected from outer space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koupelis|first=Theo|author2=Karl F. Kuhn|title=In Quest of the Universe|publisher=[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers]]|year=2007|edition=5th|isbn=0-7637-4387-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwKjznJ9Kq0C|accessdate=2008-04-02|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first radio sky survey was conducted by [[Grote Reber]] and was completed in 1941. In the 1970s, some stars in our galaxy were found to be radio emitters, one of the strongest being the unique [[Binary star|binary]] [[MWC 349]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Braes | first=L.L.E. | year=1974 | title=Radio Continuum Observations of Stellar Sources | journal=IAU Symposium No.60, Maroochydore, Australia, September 3–7, 1973 | pages=377–381 | bibcode=1974IAUS...60..377B | volume=60 | doi=10.1017/s007418090002670x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources: solar system==

===The Sun===
As the nearest star, the [[Sun]] is the brightest radiation source in most frequencies, down to the radio spectrum at 300&amp;nbsp;MHz (1 m wavelength).  When the Sun is quiet, the galactic background noise dominates at longer wavelengths. During [[geomagnetic storm]]s, the Sun will dominate even at these low frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Stix|title=The sun: an introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wxHN9jP-mNMC|year=2004|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-20741-2}} section 1.5.4 The Radio Spectrum&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jupiter===
Oscillation of electrons trapped in the  [[magnetosphere of Jupiter]] produce strong radio signals, particularly bright in the decimeter band.

The magnetosphere of Jupiter is responsible for intense episodes of radio emission from the planet's polar regions. Volcanic activity on Jupiter's moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] injects gas into Jupiter's magnetosphere, producing a torus of particles about the planet. As Io moves through this torus, the interaction generates [[Alfvén wave]]s that carry ionized matter into the polar regions of Jupiter. As a result, radio waves are generated through a [[cyclotron]] [[Astrophysical maser|maser mechanism]], and the energy is transmitted out along a cone-shaped surface. When Earth intersects this cone, the radio emissions from Jupiter can exceed the solar radio output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=February 20, 2004 |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2004/20feb_radiostorms |title=Radio Storms on Jupiter |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=August 23, 2017 }} ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070213220639/https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2004/20feb_radiostorms.htm archived version])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources: galactic==
=== The galactic center ===
The [[galactic center]] of the Milky Way was the first radio source to be detected. It contains a number of radio sources, including [[Sagittarius A*]] and the [[Sagittarius A*#Central black hole|supermassive black hole at its center]].

===Supernova remnants===
[[Supernova remnant]]s often show diffuse radio emission. Examples include [[Cassiopeia A]], the brightest extrasolar radio source in the sky, and the [[Crab Nebula]].

===Neutron Stars===

====Pulsars====
[[Image:Pulsar schematic.svg|thumb|right|Schematic view of a pulsar. The sphere in the middle represents the neutron star, the curves indicate the magnetic field lines, the protruding cones represent the emission beams and the green line represents the axis on which the star rotates.]]
Supernovas sometimes leave behind dense spinning [[neutron stars]] called [[pulsar]]s. They emit jets of charged particles which emit [[synchrotron radiation]] in the radio spectrum. Examples include the [[Crab Pulsar]], the first pulsar to be discovered. Pulsars and [[quasar]]s (dense central cores of extremely distant galaxies) were both discovered by radio astronomers. In 2003 astronomers using the [[Parkes Observatory|Parkes]] [[radio telescope]] discovered two pulsars orbiting each other, the first such system known.

====Rotating Radio Transient (RRAT) Sources ====
[[Rotating radio transient]]s (RRATs) are a type of neutron stars discovered in 2006 by a team led by [[Maura McLaughlin]] from the [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]] at the [[University of Manchester]] in the UK. RRATs are believed to produce radio emissions which are very difficult to locate, because of their transient nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=new-kind-of-star-found |title=New Kind of Star Found |author=David Biello |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |date=2006-02-16 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early efforts have been able to detect radio emissions (sometimes called '''RRAT flashes''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/24227/1/0602092 |title=RRAT flash |publisher=Physics World |author=Jodrell Bank Observatory |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; for less than one second a day, and, like with other single-burst signals, one must take great care to distinguish them from terrestrial radio interference. Distributing computing and the Astropulse algorithm may thus lend itself to further detection of RRATs.

===Star forming regions===
Short [[radio waves]] are emitted from complex [[molecules]] in dense clouds of [[gas]] where [[star]]s are giving birth.

[[Spiral galaxy|Spiral galaxies]] contain clouds of [[neutral hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]] which emit radio waves. The radio frequencies of these two molecules were used to map a large portion of the Milky Way galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gonzalez|first=Guillermo|author2= Wesley Richards|title=The Privileged Planet|publisher=[[Regnery Publishing]]|year=2004|isbn=0-89526-065-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFdu4CyQ1k0C|accessdate=2008-04-02|page=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources: extra-galactic==
===Radio galaxies===
Many galaxies are strong radio emitters, called [[Radio galaxy|radio galaxies]]. Some of the more notable are [[Centaurus A]] and [[Messier 87]].

[[Quasar]]s (short for "quasi-stellar radio source") were one of the first point-like radio sources to be discovered. Quasars' extreme [[red shift]] led us to conclude that they are distant active galactic nuclei, believed to be powered by [[black hole]]s.    [[Active Galactic Nucleus|Active galactic nuclei]] have jets of charged particles which emit [[synchrotron radiation]].  One example is [[3C 273]], the optically brightest quasar in the sky.

Merging [[Galaxy groups and clusters|galaxy clusters]] often show diffuse radio emission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcetri.astro.it/~buttery/thesis/node69.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060128231925/http://www.arcetri.astro.it/~buttery/thesis/node69.html |archivedate=2006-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmic microwave background===
{{main|Cosmic microwave background}}
The cosmic microwave background is [[blackbody]] [[background radiation]] left over from the [[Big Bang]] (the rapid expansion, roughly 13.8 billion years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; that was the beginning of the [[universe]]).

=== Extragalactic pulses ===
{{main|Fast radio burst}}
D. R. Lorimer and others analyzed archival survey data and found a 30-[[jansky]] dispersed burst, less than 5 milliseconds in duration, located 3° from the [[Small Magellanic Cloud]]. They reported that the burst properties argue against a physical association with our Galaxy or the Small Magellanic Cloud. In a recent paper, they argue that current models for the free electron content in the universe imply that the burst is less than 1 giga[[parsec]] distant. The fact that no further bursts were seen in 90 hours of additional observations implies that it was a singular event such as a supernova or coalescence (fusion) of relativistic objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/318/5851/777?ck=nck |title=A Bright Millisecond Radio Burst of Extragalactic Origin |author1=D. R. Lorimer |author2=M. Bailes |author3=M. A. McLaughlin |author4=D. J. Narkevic |author5=F. Crawford |journal=Science |date=2007-09-27 |accessdate=2010-06-23 |doi=10.1126/science.1147532 |volume=318 |pages=777–780|arxiv = 0709.4301 |bibcode = 2007Sci...318..777L }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that hundreds of similar events could occur every day and, if detected, could serve as cosmological probes. Radio pulsar surveys such as Astropulse-SETI@home offer one of the few opportunities to monitor the radio sky for impulsive burst-like events with millisecond durations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atnf.csiro.au/news/newsletter/oct07/MSburst.htm |title=A bright millisecond radio burst of extragalactic origin |author=Duncan Lorimer (West Virginia University, USA) |author2=Matthew Bailes (Swinburne University) |author3=Maura McLaughlin (West Virginia University, USA) |author4=David Narkevic (West Virginia University, USA) |author5=Fronefield Crawford (Franklin &amp; Marshall College, USA) |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Australia Telescope National Facility |date=October 2007 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the isolated nature of the observed phenomenon, the nature of the source remains speculative.  Possibilities include a black hole-[[neutron star]] collision, a neutron star-neutron star collision, a black hole-black hole collision, or some phenomenon not yet considered.

In 2010 there was a new report of 16 similar pulses from the Parkes Telescope which were clearly of terrestrial origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1009.5392 |author1=Sarah Burke-Spolaor |author2=Matthew Bailes |author3=Ronald Ekers |author4=Jean-Pierre Macquart |author5=Fronefield Crawford III |title=Radio Bursts with Extragalactic Spectral Characteristics Show Terrestrial Origins |year=2010 |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/727/1/18 |volume=727 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |page=18|bibcode = 2011ApJ...727...18B }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2013 four pulse sources were identified that supported the likelihood of a genuine extragalactic pulsing population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6141/53 |title=A Population of Fast Radio Bursts at Cosmological Distances |author1=D. Thornton |author2=B. Stappers |author3=M. Bailes |author4=B. Barsdell |author5=S. Bates |author6=N. D. R. Bhat |author7=M. Burgay |author8=S. Burke-Spolaor |author9=D. J. Champion |author10=P.

Possenti |author20=W. van Straten |publisher=Science |date=2013-07-05 |accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These pulses are known as ''fast radio bursts'' (FRBs). The first observed burst has become known as the ''Lorimer burst''. [[Blitzar]]s are one proposed explanation for them.

==Sources: not yet observed==
===Primordial black holes===
According to the Big Bang Model (also called the [[Standard Model]]), during the first few moments after the Big Bang, pressure and temperature were extremely great. Under these conditions, simple fluctuations in the density of matter may have resulted in local regions dense enough to create black holes. Although most regions of high density would be quickly dispersed by the expansion of the universe, a primordial black hole would be stable, persisting to the present.

One goal of [[Astropulse]] is to detect postulated mini black holes that might be evaporating due to "[[Hawking radiation]]". Such mini black holes are postulated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29199 |title=The case for mini black holes |publisher=Cern Courier |date=2004-11-24 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; to have been created during the Big Bang, unlike currently known black holes. [[Martin Rees]] has theorized that a black hole, exploding via Hawking radiation, might produce a signal that's detectable in the radio.  The Astropulse project hopes that this evaporation would produce radio waves that Astropulse can detect. The evaporation wouldn't create radio waves directly. Instead, it would create an expanding fireball of high-energy [[gamma rays]] and particles. This fireball would interact with the surrounding magnetic field, pushing it out and generating radio waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/ap_prbh.php |title=Primordial Black Holes |publisher=SETI@home |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ET ===
{{main|Search for extraterrestrial intelligence}}
Previous searches by various "search for extraterrestrial intelligence" (SETI) projects, starting with [[Project Ozma]], have looked for extraterrestrial communications in the form of narrow-band signals, analogous to our own radio stations. The [[Astropulse]] project argues that since we know nothing about how ET might communicate, this might be a bit closed-minded. Thus, the Astropulse Survey can be viewed{{by whom|date=October 2016}} as complementary to the narrow-band SETI@home survey as a by-product of the search for physical phenomena.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Other undiscovered phenomena ===
Explaining their recent discovery of a powerful bursting radio source, NRL astronomer Dr. Joseph Lazio stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrao.edu/pr/2005/newsource/ |title=Astronomers Detect Powerful Bursting Radio Source Discovery Points to New Class of Astronomical Objects |publisher= |author=Andrea Gianopoulos |author2=Shannon Wells |author3=Michelle Lurch-Shaw |author4=Janice Schultz |author5=DonnaMcKinney |date=2005-03-02 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Amazingly, even though the sky is known to be full of transient objects emitting at X- and gamma-ray wavelengths, very little has been done to look for radio bursts, which are often easier for astronomical objects to produce."  The use of coherent dedispersion algorithms and the computing power provided by the SETI network may lead to discovery of previously undiscovered phenomena.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5698">'''Buhla''' is the name for a skeleton of a prehistoric ([[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian]]) woman found in a quarry near [[Buhl, Idaho]], [[United States]], in January 1989.  The skeleton's age has been estimated by [[radiocarbon dating]] at 10,675 ± 95 BP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/9811/newsbriefs/buhl.html|title=Buhl Woman - Archaeology Magazine Archive|author=|date=|website=archive.archaeology.org|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202174949/http://archive.archaeology.org/9811/newsbriefs/buhl.html |archivedate=2 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which confirms this as one of the oldest sets of human remains found in the [[Americas]].  The discovery was made by a quarry worker when he noticed what was found to be a thigh bone in the screen of a rock crusher.  The nearly complete skeleton was subsequently unearthed nearby.

==Scientific analysis==
An analysis of the skeleton showed that Buhla was between 17 and 21 years old, {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m|2|abbr=on}} tall, and was in general good health.  The cause of death could not be determined.

Carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of Buhla's bone [[collagen]] suggests that Buhla ate largely [[bison]] and [[elk]], with occasional [[salmon]] and other fish.  The wear patterns in her teeth indicated that the meat was cooked before eating.  Her teeth showed signs of heavy wear caused by sand or grit, wear that would be consistent with the use of stone grinding or pounding. Defects in tooth enamel and lines of interrupted growth on her femur indicate periodic malnutrition. This nutritional stress could be seasonal and/or the result of childhood diseases.

No genetic testing was done, and there is disagreement concerning the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the skull.  [[Anthropologist]] Todd Fenton of [[Michigan State University]] has indicated that the skull's morphology is similar to that of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] and [[East Asian]] populations, while according to anthropologist Richard Jantz of the [[University of Tennessee]], "She doesn't fit into any modern group but is most similar to today's [[Polynesians]]."

==Possibility of grave goods==
Buhla's right cheek lay atop a pressure-flaked, pointed [[obsidian]] tool.  Since this tool shows no sign of wear, and since the positioning of this tool seems deliberate, it has been theorized that it was made as a grave offering.  In addition, fragments from what could be an awl or pin and a broken bone needle were found with the skeleton, along with an incised [[badger]] bone.  Like the obsidian tool, the eye of the bone needle showed no signs of wear.

==Reburial==
Buhla was found on State land, not federal, so the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA) did not apply.  She was repatriated under State of Idaho Statute, the general provisions of which are that remains determined to be Native American are to be returned to the nearest federally recognized Tribe, in this instance, the [[Fort Hall Indian Reservation|Shoshone–Bannock Tribes at Fort Hall]]. In 1992, the remains and the artifacts were turned over to the Shoshone–Bannock of Fort Hall over the strenuous objections of many archaeologists, and despite the lack of evidence linking Buhla with this tribe.  The tribe reburied the remains in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friendsofpast.org/earliest-americans/map.html|title=Friends of America's Past: Earliest Americans: Status of Ancient Remains|author=|date=|website=www.friendsofpast.org|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209111639/http://www.friendsofpast.org/earliest-americans/map.html |archivedate=9 February 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20803">'''Clarence Stanley Coe (C. S. Coe)''' (b. [[Riverside, Iowa]], December 24, 1865, d. [[St. Augustine, Florida]], March 5, 1939) was an American master bridge builder and railroad civil engineer, who supervised the planning and building of the [[Florida East Coast Railway]]’s [[Seven Mile Bridge]], linking the [[Florida Keys]] to [[Marathon, Florida|Marathon]], [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe County]], which, when completed in January 1912, was acclaimed as the longest bridge in the world and an engineering marvel.  Later, Coe was appointed the first city manager of [[Miami]], [[Florida]], and after that was appointed chief engineer of [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]], Florida.

==Early life and career==
Coe was one of nine children born to Sylvester Coe and his wife, Ann (née Rowlands), a native of [[Llangollen, Wales]].

He was educated at the [[University of Minnesota]], earning a degree in engineering in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/photos/stories/12444697  "Col. Clarence S. Coe," '''Iowa City Press Citizen''', Iowa City, Iowa, March 11, 1939, p.4.]&lt;/ref&gt;  After graduation, Coe held various engineering positions in the rapidly expanding railroad industry.

In 1905, he joined the Florida East Coast Railway, first as resident managing engineer of the [[Overseas Railroad|Key West Extension]], having charge of [[viaduct]] construction.  As resident manager, he constructed viaducts totaling nearly 12 miles over open water.  Coe had charge of the entire engineering and inspection departments, the labor force, and all floating equipment.

In 1910, Coe was promoted to division engineer with responsibility for overseeing construction of the [[Seven Mile Bridge]] over open ocean, a feat never before attempted.

===Involvement with Florida East Coast Railway===
The railroad line south of [[West Palm Beach]] was constructed in phases by the Florida East Coast Railway and its predecessor systems. Founder and owner [[Henry Flagler]] began his railroad building in 1892.  Under Florida's generous land-grant laws passed in 1893, {{convert|8000|acre}} could be claimed from the state for every mile (1.6&amp;nbsp; km) built. Flagler would eventually claim a total in excess of two million acres (8,000&amp;nbsp; km²) for building the FEC, and land development and trading along the line would become one of his most profitable endeavors.

Before it became the FEC, the [[Jacksonville, St. Augustine and Indian River Railway]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://augustine.com/gallery-image/florida-ca1893-jacksonville-st-augustine-indian-river-railway Route May, circa 1893]&lt;/ref&gt; was constructing a line southwards from Daytona Beach in 1894. [[Fort Pierce, Florida|Fort Pierce]] was reached on January 29, and West Palm Beach on March 22. Further extension southwards did not begin until June 1895, when a favorable deal was signed with Miami-area business interests. [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] was reached on March 3 of the following year. By April, the construction reached [[Biscayne Bay]], the largest and most accessible harbor on Florida's east coast.

===Key West Extension===
{{Main|Overseas Railroad}}
[[File:Florida east coast causeway to Key West (CJ Allen, Steel Highway, 1928).jpg|thumb|''en route'' to Key West]]
Never one to rest on his laurels, Flagler next sought perhaps his greatest challenge:  the extension of the Florida East Coast Railway to Key West, a city of almost 20,000 inhabitants located {{convert|128|mi|km}} beyond the tip of the Florida [[peninsula]].

One of the reasons Flagler wanted to build the Key West Extension was at the time Key West was a major coaling station for ship traffic between South America and New York. Flagler thought it would be profitable for coal to be brought by railroad to Key West for coaling those ships. But by the time the railroad was finished in 1912, range had been extended on the ships to such a degree that Key West was no longer a desirable stopover for coal.

Flagler also believed that linking Key West to the mainland after the United States announced in 1905 the construction of the [[Panama Canal]], since the city was the United States' closest deep-water port to the [[canal]], would be of advantage to [[Cuba]]n and [[Latin America]] trade, as the opening of the canal would allow significant trade opportunities with the west.

The construction of the [[Overseas Railroad]] required many engineering innovations as well as vast amounts of labor and monetary resources. At one time during construction, 4,000 men were employed. During the seven-year construction, three [[hurricane]]s threatened to halt the project.

Despite the hardships, the final link of the Florida East Coast Railway was completed in 1912. On January 22 of that year, a proud Flagler rode the first passenger train into Key West, marking the completion of the railroad's oversea connection to Key West and the linkage by railway of the entire east coast of Florida.

===Coe’s involvement in building the Seven Mile Bridge===
[[File:Moser Channel Bridge, details of Center Pier for Draw, 7-3-09 (Dwg B-262). - Seven Mile Bridge, Linking Florida Keys, Marathon, Monroe County, FL.jpg|thumb|''Detail of Moser Channel Bridge Center Pier]]
Originally known as the Knights Key-Pigeon Key-Moser Channel-Pacet Channel Bridge, the [[Seven Mile Bridge]] was constructed from 1909 to 1912 under the direction of Coe as part of the Florida East Coast Railway's Key West Extension, also known as the Overseas Railroad.
The logistics of assembling labor and materials and overcoming the difficulties presented by deep water, normal tides and hurricanes attest to the engineering and management skills of those connected with its construction, all under Coe’s leadership and supervision.

The prevalence of devastating hurricanes and heavy seas made it imperative that the structure be unusually strong. First, the positions of the piers were charted under Coe’s direction; then dredgers scooped the sand from the sea's bed, exposing the coral rock necessary for foundations. Next, tugs towed up coffer-dams, huge steel cylinders, which were lowered over the dredged positions. Floating pile-drivers then drove steel-pointed piles into the coral rock until they were securely fixed. Through this method of working there was less risk of the piles slipping owing to shifting of rock, for the constructors were able to determine if the rock was solid or unstable and crumbling.

After the sinking of the piles, concrete was dumped upon the sea bed to a depth of 5&amp;nbsp;ft., forming the real basis for the piers. Molds were used for the shaping of the reinforced concrete arches and great precautions taken to obviate cracks set up by expansion. The rubble for the concrete was blasted out of the coral, and lifted onto floating platforms, where it was flung into large mechanical mixers.

When the track passed over shallow water travelling excavators were utilized to form a solid embankment of debris. Pipe-lines were laid down in some places along the center of the permanent way, and the ballast pumped through these conduits was deposited where required, the water draining off. The drying and draining of these embankments took a long while owing to the saturated state of the soil.

Coe determined that the destructive force of the waves lay not in their impact against the bank, but in their retreat or undertow, which dragged away and undermined it. Experiment proved that a smooth surface, over which the heavy seas might glide and in their retreat find no hold, offered the best solution to the problem. Material for such a coating was discovered in the marine marl deposits along the line. This form of clay spread over the surface of the embankments, hardened on exposure to the air, and was capable of withstanding the heaviest seas.

The railhead approached Knight's Key itself in February, 1908. Operations then ceased temporarily while the builders considered how the seven miles of sea, varying from 18 to 22&amp;nbsp;ft. deep, should be overcome. Owing to the impossibility of dumping for an embankment, Coe decided to build a viaduct. This Knight's Key Bridge is the longest single structure in the whole Key West Extension, stretching seven miles across open sea. From one end of it the distant shore is barely visible. Due to the depth of the water, huge steel girders mounted on concrete piers were used. The bridge comprised 316 80-ft. spans, 19 60-ft. spans and 210 53-ft. concrete arches at the southern end where shallower water was found. The track itself lay 30&amp;nbsp;ft. above the low tide water mark. At the point where the lines ran across Moser Channel a swing bridge, approximately 250&amp;nbsp;ft. in length, was introduced to allow the passage of shipping.

At [[Bahia Honda Key|Bahia Honda]], there was another strip of open sea, where depths of 30&amp;nbsp;ft. were encountered, and this presented an even greater obstacle than the Knight's Key section. Bahia Honda has a total length of just over a mile. Here Coe decided that another bridge had to be constructed, having 13 spans, each 128&amp;nbsp;ft. long, 13 spans of 186&amp;nbsp;ft., and one more of 247&amp;nbsp;ft. In addition there are nine arches of 80-foot span.

When the work on bridges began beyond Knight's Key, Coe outsourced the setting of the steel to various contractors. As this method proved unsuccessful, the operations were put exclusively in the hands of Coe's own men. The deck girder spans were brought to the piers on barges, and were then lifted and set in place by floating derricks. The railway gangers completed their tasks in less than half the time taken by the contractors. On one occasion, six spans were placed in position within four hours, while on another the laborers erected a span in twenty minutes. The Bahia Honda bridge was built by means of temporary timber framework and an overhead travelling crane. The precautions taken to ensure the workers' safety were such that not a life was lost during the erection of the 32,900&amp;nbsp;ft. of steel that went to the building of Knight's Key and Bahia Honda bridges.

But even these two great bridges did not suffice. Before the island of Key West could be reached by the railway, yet another 2,500 odd feet had to be traversed, and Coe decided that a viaduct would be best for this remaining part of the route.

Coe had yet another problem in the adequate protection of the vast quantities of steelwork in the bridges from the effects of oxidization caused by exposure to salt water. The excessively moist air of Florida also rusts metal within a short space of time. Experiments to discover the most suitable rust-proof paint had been numerous, based, for the most part, on the anti-fouling compositions of red-lead similar to that used on ships' keels. The rails are also exposed to the rapid corrosion set up by the saturated air and are treated with a special protective covering.

Despite the tropical storms and hurricanes which abound in this part of the world, the extension has successfully withstood the most violent attacks which the ruthless fury of nature can unloose. One of the worst hurricanes experienced beat down upon the works in 1906.  Coe, who had been carefully observing atmospheric conditions, noted an approaching disturbance, and the governmental observatory also gave him due warning. The builders, however, had received a false alarm in 1905 and did not take sufficient heed The storm swept mercilessly upon the workings. The gangers scurried to the frail shelter of their floating quarters on the barges. The houseboats were torn loose from their moorings ; some were driven out into the fury of the raging sea, while others were flung and shattered against the keys and reefs. Passing steamers rescued many survivors after days of exposure, but more than seventy men were lost.

In 1909, another hurricane reached a velocity of 125 miles an hour. This time, warning instructions were observed and the barges towed into safety beforehand. Although miles of embankment were washed away no real damage was done to the concrete work. Five girders on Knight's Key Bridge were blown from their piers due to the failure of the contractors to put in the necessary number of anchor bolts. A study of the destructive force of these storms was responsible for many radical changes in construction plans, and as a result the present work is practically storm proof.

Some remarkable figures give an idea of the vast amount of work involved in the construction of the Key West extension. The project from beginning to end meant the assembling of 38,000 tons of structural steel, 461,000 cubic yards of concrete ; the transport and distribution of 800,000 barrels of cement, 96,000 tons of rock, 78,000 tons of gravel, and 300,000 cubic yards of coralline rock. In addition to this the constructors had to shift some 2,000 tons of reinforced steel, 70,000 pine piles, and approximately 100,000 tons of spoil for filling in shallows and making up embankments.

The longest and in some respects the most imposing of all structures on the Key West Extension from an engineering standpoint was the Knights Key-Pigeon Key-Moser Channel-Pacet Channel Bridge, later commonly known as the Seven Mile Bridge. Three years were required to complete this huge structure. Work began in the spring of 1909 and was completed in January, 1912. The bridge was 35,815 feet in length, and consisted of 335 80-foot and 60-foot deck plate girder steel spans, rested on concrete piers, and a concrete viaduct, consisting of 210 53-foot arches and a drawbridge 253 feet in length. Altogether, the bridge rested upon 546 concrete foundation piers, far exceeding the number in any other railway bridge in the world. Each of the piers in the main structure rested on bedrock, in some cases as much as 28 feet below the water line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/fl/fl0200/fl0293/data/fl0293data.pdf  "The Seven Mile Bridge," PHOTOGRAPHS WRITTEN HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE DATA, Historic American Engineering Record National Park Service, Department of the Interior, Washington D.C. 20240]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnitude of Coe’s engineering accomplishment===
The railroad to Key West continued in operation for 23 years until on [[1935 Labor Day hurricane|Labor Day,1935]], one of the most destructive hurricanes that ever visited the Florida Keys inflicted severe damage to a great number of miles of embarkment and track—not, however, to the great steel and concrete bridge structures that formed the vital part of the project, including the Seven Mile Bridge.

The building of Key West over land and sea under a torrid sun, across channels and surging waters, across bleak little islands, swept by fierce tropical storms, ranks as one of the greatest achievements in railway engineering. There were no precedents to follow in building the Key West Extension, especially the Seven Mile Bridge portion, for nothing like it had ever been attempted before—or has been since. Coe developed methods of construction to meet untried conditions, and those methods proved successful.  Indeed, most of the Key West extension still withstand the imponderable forces of nature—wind, sea and tide.

In January 1912, when it was completed, the Seven Mile Bridge, linking the Florida Keys to [[Marathon]], [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe County]], was acclaimed as the longest bridge in the world, an engineering marvel. It was the most costly of all Flagler's bridges in the Key West Extension.  From 1912 until portions of the Extension were destroyed by [[1935 Labor Day hurricane|a hurricane in 1935]], the Key West Extension served as the one and only vital link between Miami and Key West.

===Legacy of Seven Mile Bridge construction feat===
The [[Overseas Highway]] is a {{convert|113|mi|km|1|adj=on}} highway carrying [[U.S. Route 1 in Florida|U.S. Route 1]] (US&amp;nbsp;1) through the Florida Keys. Large parts of it were built on the former [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] of the Overseas Railroad, the Key West Extension of the Florida East Coast Railway. Completed in 1912, the Overseas Railroad was heavily damaged and partially destroyed in the [[Labor Day Hurricane of 1935]]. The Florida East Coast Railway was financially unable to rebuild the destroyed sections, so the roadbed and remaining bridges were sold to the state of [[Florida]] for $640,000.

In effect, owner and founder Flager’s money and Coe’s engineering genius provided private money and engineering expertise to pay for and design the public infrastructure that became U.S. Route 1.  It is doubtful if the highway would ever have been laid out and built if the Florida East Coast Railway had not planned, designed and built the route and bridge infrastructure that were subsequently used to construct the original highway.

==War service and later career==
After the Key West Extension was completed, Coe was named Engineer Maintenance of Way for the railroad, a position he held until he volunteered for military service in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=I0Y_AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;dq=c.+s.+coe+florida+east+coast&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nPmf8_2-fi&amp;sig=quAAlaTM3n84M7Ukll3G_R-HmDQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdxdynjOXLAhWEXR4KHXh2BA4Q6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=c.%20s.%20coe%20florida%20east%20coast&amp;f=false  ''Railway Age and Railway Review'', Volume 63, August 3, 1917, p. 218]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outbreak of World War I, at the age of 51, Coe enlisted as captain of Company A, [[Coats of arms of U.S. Engineer Battalions|17th U.S. Engineers]], commanded by Col. [[Charles G. Dawes]] (later the [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|30th]] [[Vice President of the United States]] (1925–29)) and succeeded General Dawes, as colonel.  After the war, President [[Herbert C. Hoover]] recommended Coe to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|King of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] as an adviser, and Coe spent two years rebuilding the Balkan railroads.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SfHNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA9-PA36&amp;lpg=RA9-PA36&amp;dq=%22c.+s.+coe%22+engineering&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Cv9g9TAgPp&amp;sig=H11cYXEIpYOn5OENffhXxtdqlqo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-psP1oOLLAhUE2R4KHWAIAm84ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22c.%20s.%20coe%22%20engineering&amp;f=false  ''Professional Engineer'', Volumes 3-4, 1919]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Coe was appointed the first [[city manager]] of Miami in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xwU0AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;dq=united+state+congress+clarence+s+coe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dflkV5Fsu3&amp;sig=6PsoUeYm1MDt8Ex4dMqsuRU1DQw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-rcP4m-TLAhWJVyYKHXykBFwQ6AEIMDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=united%20state%20congress%20clarence%20s%20coe&amp;f=false  ''Highway Engineer and Contractor World, Volume 19, Oct. 1921, 286]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1922, he was appointed county engineer of [[Duval County, Florida]].

Later, he returned to France and oversaw the dredging of the harbor and the construction of the great docks and terminals the Port of [[Bordeaux]].
 
From 1936 to 1939, Coe was in charge of the public housing program in Miami and built [[Liberty Square (Miami)|one set of over 750 housing units]] for [[African-American]] residents of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcollections.fiu.edu/tequesta/files/1988/88_1_04.pdf  "LIBERTY SQUARE: 1933-1987, THE ORIGINS AND EVOLUTION OF A PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECT," by Paul S. George and Thomas K. Petersen, '''Tequesta''', 1988, 53-68]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Coe received the following decorations: [[Legion of Honour|Chevalier Legion of Honor of France]]; [[Order of the White Eagle (Serbia)]]; [[Order of St. Xavier]]; [[Order of the Black Eagle]]; and (conferred by General [[John J. Pershing]]) the [[Order of the Purple Heart]]. The [[United States Congress]] adopted resolutions recognizing Coe’s services.

==Personal life==
In 1891, Coe married Luela Joy.  The couple had five children.
 
Coe died at age 73, on March 5, 1939, in St. Augustine and was buried in [[St. Augustine National Cemetery]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=coe&amp;GSfn=clarence&amp;GSmn=stanley&amp;GSby=1865&amp;GSbyrel=in&amp;GSdy=1939&amp;GSdyrel=in&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=3963464&amp;df=all&amp;  Find A Grave]&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in [[evolutionary psychology]] suggests that the brain is a coordinated network of domain-specific modules corresponding to various adaptations that emerged in our evolutionary history.&lt;ref name=":norenbuss" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrett|first1=H.

=== Theory of mind ===
Theory of mind (ToM) is a capacity to attribute mental states, complete with thoughts, emotions and motivations, to other social agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Premack|first1=David|last2=Woodruff|first2=Guy|title=Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=4 February 2010|volume=1|issue=04|pages=515|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00076512}}&lt;/ref&gt; This adaptation is ubiquitous in primitive forms among various social species, but the complexity of human social life for long stretches of evolutionary history has facilitated a rich understanding of others' mental experiences to match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barclay|first1=Pat|editor1-last=Buss|editor1-first=David|title=The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology|date=2016|edition=2nd|chapter=Reputation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of [[autism]] have been cited in support for the proposition that ToM is a distinct modular adaptation because of its distinctly narrow impact on ToM capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baron-Cohen|first1=Simon|title=Mindblindness: an essay on autism and theory of mind|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass [u.a.]|isbn=026252225X|edition=1. pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ToM is thought to lend itself to an intuitive sense of [[mind-body dualism]], where the material body is animated by a non-material self (i.e., a "soul").&lt;ref name="boyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pursosis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purzycki &amp; Sosis|editor1-last=Ulrich|editor1-first=Frey|title=Essential Building Blocks of Human Nature|date=2011|chapter=Our Gods: Variation in Supernatural Minds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Essentialism ===
[[Folk psychology]] among humans is characterized by essential thinking, or a tendency to interpret objects in terms of "essences." This means that attributions of objects' underlying realities are intuitively inferred from a [[fuzzy set]] of the object's [[Ontology|ontological]] features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prentice|first1=Deborah A.|last2=Miller|first2=Dale T.|title=Psychological Essentialism of Human Categories|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2007|volume=16|issue=4|pages=202–206|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00504.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive interpretations of essence give rise to concepts of purity, simplified good and evil concepts, and intuitive senses of meaning applied to teleology.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt;

=== Hyperactive agency detection device ===
The capacity for agent detection has been an important modular adaptation for predator avoidance in humans. Some have called this mechanism a hyperactive agency detection device because of its fairly high rate of erroneous agency applications. In a potential predator situation, humans are forced to interpret an object's ontological features, infer agency or non-agency, and execute a behavioral response. Evolutionary theorists have cited the relatively low costs of incorrect agency inferences and the severe [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] costs of detection failure as a reason to suspect that a tendency to interpret naturalistic processes as agent behaviors is an adaptation.&lt;ref name="boyer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boyer|first1=Pascal|title=Religion explained : the evolutionary origins of religious thought|date=2001|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465006960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=K.|last2=Wegner|first2=D. M.|title=Blaming God for Our Pain: Human Suffering and the Divine Mind|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=19 November 2009|volume=14|issue=1|pages=7–16|doi=10.1177/1088868309350299}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a cognitive bias that leads humans to reason about objects and processes in agentive terms.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt; This is particularly foundational to beliefs in a god or gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrett|first1=Justin L.|title=Why would anyone believe in God?|date=2004|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Lanham, MD [u.a.]|isbn=978-0759106673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minimally counterintuitive beliefs ===
The integration of ToM, hyperactive applications of agency and essential psychology ultimately renders a cognitive tendency for humans to interact with the naturalistic processes of the world with the [[intentional stance]]. This is a perspective from which humans reason that objects and processes may be enacting behaviors intentionally, with meaningful, rational mental states of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennett|first1=Daniel C.|title=The intentional stance|date=1989|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262540533|edition=1st MIT Press paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious beliefs are successfully transmitted if they are compatible with the cognitive tools that reconstruct them upon reception. This means that they must be minimally counterintuitive, or that they violate few enough ontological features of an object or process, to make general sense while remaining memorable violations nonetheless.&lt;ref name="atranhenrich" /&gt; For example, the concept of a [[ghost]] exploits existing intuitions about mind-body dualism and only violates the usual coupling of mind and body. This creates a memorable concept of a non-material person that can move through walls and have motives of its own. On the other hand, a highly counterintuitive idea about an object that violates several of its ontological features, like a jealous Frisbee, is less likely to be [[Dual inheritance theory|culturally transmitted]]. This is because it is cognitively demanding, not easily reconstructed by the brain and thus, not easily reasoned about and remembered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mesoudi|first1=Alex|title=Cultural Evolution. ; How Darwinian Theory Can Explain Human Culture and Synthesize the Social Sciences.|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226520445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious behaviors associated with culturally transmitted god concepts can be conceptualized as phenotypic strategies associated with the informational makeup of that cultural concept.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Successfully transmitted religious concepts typically involve minimally counterintuitive violations of the intentional stance, which serves a cognitive constraint of cultural evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henrich|first1=Joseph|last2=Boyd|first2=Robert|last3=Richerson|first3=Peter J.|title=Five Misunderstandings About Cultural Evolution|journal=Human Nature|date=19 April 2008|volume=19|issue=2|pages=119–137|doi=10.1007/s12110-008-9037-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ecological factors also play a role in determining which religious behaviors (and their god concepts) are more likely to be replicated.&lt;ref name="purzinpress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=The Evolution of Gods' Minds in the Tyva Republic|journal=Current Anthropology|date=13 April 2016|pages=S000–S000|doi=10.1086/685729|volume=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that religious rituals associated with salient representational models of gods' minds and concerns are more likely to survive when they are adaptive strategies.&lt;ref name="boyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="purz12"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin G.|last2=Finkel|first2=Daniel N.|last3=Shaver|first3=John|last4=Wales|first4=Nathan|last5=Cohen|first5=Adam B.|last6=Sosis|first6=Richard|title=What Does God Know?

== Ecology of god concepts ==
Cross-culturally, representational models of gods' minds take an array of diverse forms, such as anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures, abstract forces, or some combination of these. Models of gods' minds typically fall within a spectrum between two extremes: on one end there are Big Gods, and on the other there are Local Gods.&lt;ref name="norenbiggods"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norenzayan|first1=Ara|title=Big gods : how religion transformed cooperation and conflict|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0691151212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Big Gods are usually moralistic, punitive and omniscient, whereas Local Gods are often concerned about ritual behaviors, amoral and limited in knowledge.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt; The subject matter that gods are believed to care across cultures fall into three categories, but may involve an admixture of more than one. These categories are (1) behaviors toward other people, (2) behaviors toward the gods themselves and (3) behaviors toward nature and/or the environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While people impute these concerns to gods' minds, they often correspond to ecological challenges.&lt;ref name="botero" /&gt; This correspondence establishes why religious ideas often covary with ecological problems in the social and natural world: because these ideas enact behavioral strategies that solve them.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="norenbiggods" /&gt;

=== Large-scale cooperation ===
Cases of large-scale [[cooperation]] in complex societies are a widely studied example of a socioecological problem that religious beliefs address. Existing models of human cooperation have included [[kin selection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamilton|first1=W.D.|title=The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=July 1964|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4|pmid=5875341}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[reciprocal altruism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trivers|first1=Robert L.|title=The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|date=March 1971|volume=46|issue=1|pages=35–57|doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[indirect reciprocity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leimar|first1=O|last2=Hammerstein|first2=P|title=Evolution of cooperation through indirect reciprocity.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=7 April 2001|volume=268|issue=1468|pages=745–53|pmid=11321064|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1573|pmc=1088665}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nowak|first1=Martin A.|last2=Sigmund|first2=Karl|title=Evolution of indirect reciprocity by image scoring|journal=Nature|date=11 June 1998|volume=393|issue=6685|pages=573–577|doi=10.1038/31225|pmid=9634232}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Competitive altruism|competitive helping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barclay|first1=Pat|title=Competitive helping increases with the size of biological markets and invades defection|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=July 2011|volume=281|issue=1|pages=47–55|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.04.023|pmid=21550351}}&lt;/ref&gt; These models are robust across certain conditions likely relevant to the [[Pleistocene]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd|first1=R.|last2=Richerson|first2=P. J.|title=Culture and the evolution of human cooperation|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=5 October 2009|volume=364|issue=1533|pages=3281–3288|doi=10.1098/rstb.2009.0134}}&lt;/ref&gt; but cooperation is easily eroded in large-scale, complex societies with frequently anonymous interactions between strangers. This is because profitable defections dominate cooperative strategies due to a lack of significant threats of [[punishment]] to defectors.&lt;ref name="mathew"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathew|first1=S.|last2=Boyd|first2=R.|title=Punishment sustains large-scale cooperation in prestate warfare|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=13 June 2011|volume=108|issue=28|pages=11375–11380|doi=10.1073/pnas.1105604108|pmid=21670285|pmc=3136302}}&lt;/ref&gt; For large-scale cooperation to succeed, a cultural [[Coordination game|coordination solution]] stabilized by sanction threats must exist.&lt;ref name="purz12" /&gt;

[[Morality and religion|Religious rules addressing moral behavior]] are cultural coordination devices that can expand the scale of cooperative behavior by motivating [[Prosocial behavior|prosociality]].&lt;ref name="norenetalpress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norenzayan|first1=Ara|last2=Shariff|first2=Azim F.|last3=Gervais|first3=Will M.|last4=Willard|first4=Aiyana K.|last5=McNamara|first5=Rita A.|last6=Slingerland|first6=Edward|last7=Henrich|first7=Joseph|title=The cultural evolution of prosocial religions|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2 December 2014|volume=39|doi=10.1017/S0140525X14001356}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important stipulation here is that these devices must be enforced by punishment threats for people who do not behave prosocially. Frequent instances of anonymity in large-scale societies and the costs associated with punishment undermine sanction threats, but widespread beliefs in morally punitive and [[Omniscience|omniscient]] gods effectively outsource the punishment costs to a pervasive social monitor. This can effectively motivate widespread prosocial behavior in large-scale, complex societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schloss|first1=Jeffrey P.|last2=Murray|first2=Michael J.|title=Evolutionary accounts of belief in supernatural punishment: a critical review|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=February 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=46–99|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2011.558707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has been empirically supported from a few different angles. For instance, the cross-cultural prevalence of omniscient, moralistic gods (i.e., Big Gods) is positively correlated with society size and complexity.&lt;ref name="norenetalpress" /&gt; Examples of sharing behaviors in [[Experimental economics|experimental economic games]] played by large-scale societies also reveal more generous behaviors when individuals are primed with Big God concepts before the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xygalatas|first1=Dimitris|last2=Klocová|first2=Eva Kundtová|last3=Cigán|first3=Jakub|last4=Kundt|first4=Radek|last5=Maňo|first5=Peter|last6=Kotherová|first6=Silvie|last7=Mitkidis|first7=Panagiotis|last8=Wallot|first8=Sebastian|last9=Kanovsky|first9=Martin|title=Location, Location, Location: Effects of Cross-Religious Primes on Prosocial Behavior|journal=The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|date=9 November 2015|pages=1–16|doi=10.1080/10508619.2015.1097287|volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shariff|first1=A.

When distant strangers of the same religion were paired in a game, their sharing behaviors were significantly more generous if their common beliefs involved Big God concepts. The researchers of this study argue that this supports the hypothesis stating that widespread beliefs in omniscient, morally punitive Big Gods may have contributed to the expansion of prosocial behavior.&lt;ref name="norenetalpress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="corelig16"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|last2=Apicella|first2=Coren|last3=Atkinson|first3=Quentin D.|last4=Cohen|first4=Emma|last5=McNamara|first5=Rita Anne|last6=Willard|first6=Aiyana K.|last7=Xygalatas|first7=Dimitris|last8=Norenzayan|first8=Ara|last9=Henrich|first9=Joseph|title=Moralistic gods, supernatural punishment and the expansion of human sociality|journal=Nature|date=10 February 2016|volume=530|issue=7590|pages=327–330|doi=10.1038/nature16980|pmid=26863190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costly signaling ===
Concerns attributed to gods about how people behave toward the gods themselves are widespread and not easily disentangled from specific ecological conditions. The reason is intuitive; [[rational agent]]s who do not care about their treatment are counterintuitive. Researchers investigating the socioecological functions of ritual behaviors in deference to gods claim that functionally, these rituals serve as costly signals of commitment to the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sosis|first1=Richard|last2=Bressler|first2=Eric R.|title=Cooperation and Commune Longevity: A Test of the Costly Signaling Theory of Religion|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|date=1 May 2003|volume=37|issue=2|pages=211–239|doi=10.1177/1069397103037002003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costly ritual displays are particularly public and ubiquitous in small-scale societies, functioning as social devices that promote intragroup cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Ronald|last2=Xygalatas|first2=Dimitris|title=Extreme Rituals as Social Technologies|journal=Journal of Cognition and Culture|date=6 November 2014|volume=14|issue=5|pages=345–355|doi=10.1163/15685373-12342130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reputations related to trustworthiness can be significantly based on adherence to ritual behavior expectations,&lt;ref name="purz11"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=Tyvan                            and the socioecological constraints of supernatural agents' minds|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=February 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=31–45|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2010.550723}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fulfillment of these expectations are often a joint function of other behavioral strategies relevant to separate domains of gods' concerns.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt; More broadly, religious costly signals are an implicit expression of honest commitment to the rest of the group, indicating that the signaler is a dedicated part of other aspect of the group's coordinated solution strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bulbulia|first1=Joseph|last2=Sosis|first2=Richard|title=Signalling theory and the evolution of religious cooperation|journal=Religion|date=September 2011|volume=41|issue=3|pages=363–388|doi=10.1080/0048721X.2011.604508}}&lt;/ref&gt; In small- and large-scale societies alike, these rituals often coexist with other categories of gods' concerns.

=== Resource management ===
Resource management and the prevention of material insecurity are more commonly associated with gods' concerns among small-scale societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNamara|first1=Rita Anne|last2=Norenzayan|first2=Ara|last3=Henrich|first3=Joseph|title=Supernatural punishment, in-group biases, and material insecurity: experiments and ethnography from Yasawa, Fiji|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=18 June 2014|volume=6|issue=1|pages=34–55|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2014.921235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="purz13"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=PurzyckI|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=Toward a Cognitive Ecology of Religious Concepts: Evidence from the Tyva Republic|journal=Journal for the Cognitive Science of Religion|date=13 August 2012|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.1558/jcsr.v1i1.99}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other aspects of religious belief often address social interactions, problems of resource acquisition and security extend from attributed gods' concerns about peoples' interactions with their natural environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An example of this effect has been alluded to by anthropologist [[Marvin Harris]], who wrote about the economic reasons that [[Hindu]] beliefs, holding cows as sacred and forbidden from slaughter, were adaptive. According to Harris, the long-standing and stable benefits derived from many Hindu peoples' use of cows for labor and sources of fuel and fertilizer seemed to outweigh the costs of not eating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Marvin|title=Cows, pigs, wars, &amp; witches : the riddles of culture|date=1989|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0679724680|edition=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another ethnographic example of an adaptive use of animal resources was described by [[Roy Rappaport]] in 1984, who considered the reasons for ritual pig sacrifice in [[Papua New Guinea]] during times of intergroup conflict. These pigs were consuming local peoples' resources and creating resource insecurities that put a strain on the local groups, escalating the intergroup competition for resources and fueling their conflict. Thus, the ritualistic sacrifices alleviated the strain on local resources and mitigated the hostilities between groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rappaport|first1=Roy Abraham|title=Pigs for the ancestors : ritual in the ecology of a New Guinea people|date=2000|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Il.|isbn=978-1577661016|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[human behavioral ecology]] researchers have more recently studied burning practices among the Australian [[Martu people]] and the consequential increases in local biodiversity. These authors, in an ethnographic discussion of the Martu people, note that these burning practices stem from religious beliefs that their practices allow the world to continue existing as they know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bird|first1=R. B.|last2=Tayor|first2=N.|last3=Codding|first3=B. F.|last4=Bird|first4=D.

Another ethnographic example of religious beliefs facilitating resource management comes from the [[Tuva people|Tyva people]], a pastoralist population in southern [[Siberia]]. They associate ritual structures called cairns with local spirit masters (''cher eezi''). These structures demarcate local territories in which spirit masters reside, and the expectation to stop and give prayer offerings out of respect to ''cher eezi'' is embedded in peoples' beliefs about them. The ''cher eezi'' are believed to be amoral and care mostly about activity within their sacred territories, such as hunting and overexploiting resources that belong to them.&lt;ref name="purz11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="purz13" /&gt; More recently, Tyva people have begun facing new challenges associated with urbanization (e.g., pollution, alcohol abuse), and the ''cher eezi'' have been more frequently believed to be concerned about these same problems.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt;

'''Cold shock response''' is the [[physiological]] response of [[organism]]s to sudden cold, especially cold water.

In humans, cold shock response is perhaps the most common cause of death from immersion in very cold water,&lt;ref name="coldii"/&gt; such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in [[drowning]]. The cold water can also cause [[Acute coronary syndrome|heart attack]] due to [[vasoconstriction]];&lt;ref name=phases /&gt; the heart has to [[Afterload|work harder to pump the same volume of blood]] throughout the body.  For people with existing [[cardiovascular disease]], the additional workload can result in [[cardiac arrest]].  Inhalation of water (and thus drowning) may result from [[hyperventilation]]. Some people are much better able to survive swimming in very cold water due to body or mental conditioning.&lt;ref name="coldii"/&gt;

[[Hypothermia]] from exposure to cold water is not as sudden as is often believed. A person who survives the initial minute of trauma (after falling into icy water), can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they don't drown. However, the ability to perform useful work (for example to save oneself) declines substantially after ten minutes (as the body protectively cuts off blood flow to "non-essential" muscles).&lt;ref name="coldii" /&gt;

==Physiological response==
{{expand section|date=January 2018}}
The physiological response results in temporary breathlessness.

==Conditioning against cold shock==
It is possible to undergo physiological conditioning to reduce the cold shock response, and some people are naturally better suited to swimming in very cold water. Adaptations include the following:
# having an insulating layer of body fat covering the limbs and torso without being overweight;&lt;ref name="coldii" /&gt;

In these ways, winter swimmers can survive both the initial shock and prolonged exposure. Nevertheless, the human organism is not suited to freezing water: the struggle to maintain blood temperature (by swimming or conditioned metabolic response) produces great fatigue after thirty minutes or less.&lt;ref name="homeostatis" /&gt;

==Cold shock response in bacteria==
Bacteria express a well-defined set of proteins after a rapid decrease in temperature, which differ from those expressed under heat shock conditions. Cold shock proteins may include  helicases, nucleases, and ribosome-associated components that interact with DNA and RNA. Processes such as cold signal perception, membrane adaptation, and the modification of the translation apparatus are involved.&lt;ref name="Weber  2003." /&gt;

:''This article discusses categorisations of organisms. For a different meaning in biology, see [[cell division]].''

'''Division''' is a [[taxonomic rank]] in [[biological classification]] that is used differently in zoology and in botany.

In [[botany]] and [[mycology]], ''division'' refers to a rank equivalent to [[phylum]]. The use of either term is allowed under the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]],&lt;ref name="ICN"&gt;{{Cite book |year=2012 |editor-last=McNeill |editor-first=J. |displayeditors=etal|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code), Adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |edition=electronic |publisher=International Association for Plant Taxonomy |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art3 |accessdate=2017-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and both are commonly used in scientific literature.

The main Divisions of land plants, in the order in which they probably evolved, are the [[Marchantiophyta]] (liverworts),  [[Anthocerotophyta]] (hornworts), [[Moss|Bryophyta]] (mosses), [[Filicophyta]] (ferns), [[Sphenophyta]] (horsetails), [[Cycadophyta]] (cycads), [[Ginkgophyta]] (ginkgo)s, [[Pinophyta]] (conifers), [[Gnetophyta]] (gnetophytes), and the [[Magnoliophyta]] (Angiosperms, flowering plants). The flowering plants now dominate terrestrial [[ecosystem]]s, comprising 80% of [[vascular plant]] species.

In [[zoology]], the term ''division'' is applied to an optional rank subordinate to the [[infraclass]] and superordinate to the [[cohort (taxonomy)|cohort]]. A widely used classification (e.g. Carroll 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Carroll 1988|ref=Carroll}}&lt;/ref&gt;) recognises [[teleost]] fishes as a Division Teleostei within Class [[Actinopterygii]] (the ray-finned fishes). Less commonly (as in Milner 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{harv| Milner 1988|ref=Milner}}&lt;/ref&gt;), living [[tetrapods]] are ranked as Divisions [[Amphibia]] and [[Amniota]] within the [[clade]] of vertebrates with fleshy limbs ([[Sarcopterygii]]).

== Etymology ==

The word ''[[wikt:fetus#English|fetus]]'' (plural ''[[wikt:fetuses#English|fetuses]]'') is from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:en:fetus#Latin|fētus]]'' (“offspring”, “bringing forth”, “hatching of young”).&lt;ref&gt;O.E.D.2nd Ed.2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Douglas.

This spelling is the most common in most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]], except in the medical literature, where ''fetus'' is used. The more classical spelling ''fetus'' is used in Canada and the United States. In addition, ''fetus'' is now the standard English spelling throughout the world in medical journals.&lt;ref&gt;''New Oxford Dictionary of English''.&lt;/ref&gt; The spelling ''[[wikt:faetus#English|faetus]]'' was also used historically.&lt;ref&gt;''[[American Dictionary of the English Language]]'', Noah Webster, 1828.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weeks 17 to 25 (4¼ to 6¼ months)===

The amount of body fat rapidly increases. Lungs are not fully mature. [[thalamus|Thalamic]] brain connections, which mediate sensory input, form. Bones are fully developed, but are still soft and pliable. [[Iron]], [[calcium]], and [[phosphorus]] become more abundant. Fingernails reach the end of the fingertips. The [[lanugo]], or fine hair, begins to disappear, until it is gone except on the upper arms and shoulders. Small breast buds are present on both sexes. Head hair becomes coarse and thicker. Birth is imminent and occurs around the 38th week after fertilization. The fetus is considered full-term between weeks 36 and 40, when it is sufficiently developed for life outside the uterus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.babycenter.com/mybabycenter/136.html Your Pregnancy: 36 Weeks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601234206/http://www.babycenter.com/mybabycenter/136.html |date=2007-06-01 }} ''BabyCenter.com'' Retrieved June 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memidex.com/full-term "full-term" defined by Memidex/WordNet].&lt;/ref&gt; It may be 48 to 53&amp;nbsp;cm (19 to 21&amp;nbsp;inches) in length, when born.

===Variation in growth===

There is much variation in the growth of the human fetus.

[[Fetal viability]] refers to a point in fetal development at which the fetus may survive outside the womb.

== Circulatory system ==
{{main|Fetal circulation}}
===Before birth===
[[File:Fetal circulation.png|thumb|right|220px|Diagram of the human [[fetal circulatory system]].]]
The [[heart]] and [[blood vessel]]s of the [[circulatory system]], form relatively early during [[human embryogenesis|embryonic development]], but continue to grow and develop in complexity in the growing fetus.  A functional circulatory system is a biological necessity, since mammalian tissues can not grow more than a few cell layers thick without an active blood supply. The prenatal circulation of blood is different than the postnatal circulation, mainly because the lungs are not in use. The fetus obtains [[oxygen]] and nutrients from the mother through the [[placenta]] and the [[umbilical cord]].&lt;ref name="Whitaker"&gt;Whitaker, Kent. ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0766813738&amp;id=R3WK8XyAHYgC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;ots=wcft0RkRxg&amp;dq=%22fetal+circulatory+system%22&amp;sig=_DSt-D7pBSBtikfJ5oQKYVlNKmU Comprehensive Perinatal and Pediatric Respiratory Care]'' (Delmar 2001). Retrieved 2007-03-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blood from the placenta is carried to the fetus by the [[umbilical vein]]. About half of this enters the fetal ''[[ductus venosus]]'' and is carried to the [[inferior vena cava]], while the other half enters the [[liver]] proper from the inferior border of the liver. The branch of the umbilical vein that supplies the right lobe of the liver first joins with the [[portal vein]]. The blood then moves to the right atrium of the [[heart]]. In the fetus, there is an opening between the right and left atrium (the ''[[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]]''), and most of the blood flows from the right into the left atrium, thus bypassing [[pulmonary circulation]]. The majority of blood flow is into the left ventricle from where it is pumped through the [[aorta]] into the body. Some of the blood moves from the aorta through the internal iliac arteries to the umbilical arteries, and re-enters the placenta, where [[carbon dioxide]] and other waste products from the fetus are taken up and enter the woman's circulation.&lt;ref name="Whitaker"/&gt;

Some of the blood from the right atrium does not enter the left atrium, but enters the right ventricle and is pumped into the [[pulmonary artery]]. In the fetus, there is a special connection between the pulmonary artery and the aorta, called the ''[[ductus arteriosus]]'', which directs most of this blood away from the lungs (which aren't being used for respiration at this point as the fetus is suspended in [[amniotic fluid]]).&lt;ref name="Whitaker"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Postnatal development===
{{main|Adaptation to extrauterine life}}
With the first breath after birth, the system changes suddenly. [[Lung|Pulmonary]] resistance is reduced dramatically, prompting more blood to move into the [[Pulmonary artery|pulmonary arteries]] from the [[right atrium]] and [[Right ventricle|ventricle]] of the heart and less to flow through the ''[[Foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]]'' into the [[left atrium]]. The blood from the lungs travels through the [[pulmonary vein]]s to the left atrium, producing an increase in pressure that pushes the ''[[septum primum]]'' against the ''[[septum secundum]]'', closing the ''foramen ovale'' and completing the separation of the newborn's [[circulatory system]] into the standard left and right sides. Thereafter, the ''foramen ovale'' is known as the ''fossa ovalis''.

The ''[[ductus arteriosus]]'' normally closes within one or two days of birth, leaving the ''[[ligamentum arteriosum]]'', while the [[umbilical vein]] and ''[[ductus venosus]]'' usually closes within two to five days after birth, leaving, respectively, the liver's ''[[Round ligament of the uterus|ligamentum teres]]'' and ''[[ligamentum venosus]]''.

== Immune system ==

The [[placenta]] functions as a [[Placenta#Immunity|maternal-fetal barrier]] against the transmission of [[microbe]]s. When this is insufficient, [[mother-to-child transmission]] of infectious diseases can occur.

Maternal [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG antibodies]] cross the placenta, giving the fetus [[passive immunity]] against those diseases for which the mother has antibodies. This transfer of antibodies in humans begins as early as the fifth month (gestational age) and certainly by the sixth month.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=apeLf0mPx1QC&amp;pg=PA202 Page 202] of {{cite book |author = Pillitteri, Adele |title = Maternal and Child Health Nursing: Care of the Childbearing and Childrearing Family |publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location = Hagerstwon, MD |year = 2009 |pages =  |isbn = 1-58255-999-6 |oclc =  |doi =  |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developmental problems ==
{{Further|Environmental toxicants and fetal development|Birth defect}}

A developing fetus is highly susceptible to anomalies in its growth and metabolism, increasing the risk of [[birth defect]]s. One area of concern is the lifestyle choices made during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Dalby |first1 = JT |year = 1978 |title = Environmental effects on prenatal development |url =  |journal = Journal of Pediatric Psychology |volume = 3 |issue =  |pages = 105–109 |doi = 10.1093/jpepsy/3.3.105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diet is especially important in the early stages of development. Studies show that supplementation of the person's diet with [[folic acid]] reduces the risk of [[spina bifida]] and other [[neural tube]] defects. Another dietary concern is whether breakfast is eaten. Skipping breakfast could lead to extended periods of lower than normal nutrients in the maternal blood, leading to a higher risk of [[Preterm birth|prematurity]], or birth defects. 

Alcohol consumption may increase the risk of the development of [[fetal alcohol syndrome]], a condition leading to [[intellectual disability]] in some infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Streissguth, Ann Pytkowicz |title = Fetal alcohol syndrome: a guide for families and communities |publisher = Paul H Brookes Pub |location = Baltimore, MD |year = 1997 |isbn = 1-55766-283-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smoking and pregnancy|Smoking during pregnancy]] may also lead to [[miscarriage]]s and [[low birth weight]] (2500&amp;nbsp;grams, 5.5&amp;nbsp;lb). Low birth weight is a concern for medical providers due to the tendency of these infants, described as "''premature'' by weight", to have a higher risk of secondary medical problems.

[[X-ray]]s are known to have possible adverse effects on the development of the fetus, and the risks need to be weighed against the benefits.&lt;ref&gt;O’Reilly, Deirdre.

Some research shows that [[Obstetric ultrasonography|fetal ultrasounds]] (including [[Doppler ultrasonography|Doppler]], [[3D ultrasound|3D/4D ultrasound]] and [[Medical ultrasonography#Modes|2D ultrasound]]) can have some effects on birth weight and neurodevelopment. A particular concern is the possible link between the widespread use of fetal ultrasounds over the years, and the huge increase in the numbers of [[autism]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midwiferytoday.com/articles/ultrasoundrodgers.asp|title=Questions about Prenatal Ultrasound and the Alarming Increase in Autism - Midwifery Today|author=|date=1 December 2016|website=midwiferytoday.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506133254/http://www.midwiferytoday.com/articles/ultrasoundrodgers.asp|archivedate=6 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congenital disorders are acquired before birth. Infants with certain [[congenital heart defect]]s can survive only as long as the ductus remains open: in such cases the closure of the ductus can be delayed by the administration of [[prostaglandin]]s to permit sufficient time for the surgical correction of the anomalies. Conversely, in cases of [[patent ductus arteriosus]], where the ductus does not properly close, drugs that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis can be used to encourage its closure, so that surgery can be avoided.

Other heart birth defects include [[ventricular septal defect]],  [[pulmonary atresia]], and [[tetralogy of Fallot]].

A fetus is a stage in the [[prenatal development (biology)|prenatal development]] of [[viviparous]] organisms. This stage lies between [[embryogenesis]] and birth &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Many vertebrates have fetal stages, ranging from most mammals to many fish. In addition, some invertebrates bear live young, including some species of [[onychophora]]&lt;ref name=ony&gt;{{Cite journal |year = 1995 |journal = Journal of Morphology |volume = 224 |pages = 179–198 |doi = 10.1002/jmor.1052240207 |title = Developing embryo and cyclic changes in the uterus ofPeripatus (Macroperipatus) acacioi (Onychophora, Peripatidae) |author = Campiglia, Sylvia S. |last2 = Walker |first2 = Muriel H. |issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[arthropod]]s. The prevalence of [[convergent evolution]] to the fetal stage shows that it is relatively easy to develop. It presumably originates from a delay of egg release, with the eggs being hatched inside the parent before being laid. Over time, the robustness of the egg wall can be decreased until it becomes little more than a sac.

The fetuses of most mammals are situated similarly to the human fetus within their mothers.&lt;ref&gt;ZFIN, [http://zfin.org/zf_info/zfbook/stages/phar.html Pharyngula Period (24-48 h)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714230655/http://zfin.org/zf_info/zfbook/stages/phar.html |date=2007-07-14 }}. Modified from: Kimmel et al., 1995. Developmental Dynamics 203:253-310. Downloaded 5 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the anatomy of the area surrounding a fetus is different in [[Litter (animal)|litter-bearing animals]] compared to humans: each fetus of a litter-bearing animal is surrounded by placental [[Biological tissue|tissue]] and is lodged along one of two long uteri instead of the single uterus found in a human female.

Development at birth varies considerably among animals, and even among mammals. [[Altricial]] species are relatively helpless at birth and require considerable parental care and protection. In contrast, [[precocial]] animals are born with open eyes, have hair or down, have large brains, and are immediately mobile and somewhat able to flee from, or defend themselves against, [[predation|predators]]. [[Primate]]s are precocial at birth, with the exception of humans.&lt;ref&gt;Lewin, Roger. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SopsLRo1QyUC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=altricial+precocial+humans&amp;num=100&amp;ei=-IGGSf-mMJGeyASMod1A Human Evolution], page 78 (Blackwell 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The duration of gestation in [[Placentalia|placental mammals]] varies from 18 days in [[jumping mice]] to 23 months in [[elephant]]s.&lt;ref name="Sumich"&gt;Sumich, James and Dudley, Gordon. [https://books.google.com/books?id=TW2SAkgJOdMC&amp;pg=PA320&amp;dq=%22elephant%22+and+fetus&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=xXGGSZrrDpGeyASMod1A#PPA320,M1 Laboratory and Field Investigations in Marine Life], page 320 (Jones &amp; Bartlett 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, fetuses of larger land mammals require longer gestation periods.&lt;ref name="Sumich" /&gt;

The benefits of a fetal stage means that young are more developed when they are born. Therefore, they may need less parental care and may be better able to fend for themselves. However, carrying fetuses exerts costs on the mother, who must take on extra food to fuel the growth of her offspring, and whose mobility and comfort may be affected (especially toward the end of the fetal stage).

In some instances, the presence of a fetal stage may allow organisms to time the birth of their offspring to a favorable season.&lt;ref name=ony/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8901">A '''flood opening''' or '''flood vent''' (also styled '''floodvent''') is an orifice in an enclosed structure intended to allow the free passage of water between the interior and exterior.

==Flood openings in the United States==
In the [[United States]], flood openings are used to provide for the automatic equalization of [[hydrostatic pressure]] on either side of a wall. [[Building codes]] usually require the installation of flood openings in the walls of structures located in [[100-year flood|A-type flood zone]]s recognized by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]. Various agencies in the United States define necessary characteristics for flood openings. The NFIP Regulations and Building Codes require that any residential building constructed in Flood Zone Type A have the lowest floor, including basements, elevated to or above the Base Flood Elevation (BFE). Enclosed areas are permitted under elevated buildings provided that they meet certain use restrictions and construction requirements such as the installation of flood vents to allow for the automatic entry and exit of flood waters. This wet floodproofing technique is required for residential buildings.

===Engineered vs. non-engineered openings===
Most regulatory authorities in the United States that offer requirements for flood openings define two major classes of opening:&lt;ref name="codes"&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/rebuild/buildingscience/coderesources.shtm FEMA: Building Code Resources]&lt;/ref&gt; engineered, and non-engineered. The requirements for non-engineered openings are typically stricter, defining necessary characteristics for aspects ranging from overall size of each opening, to allowable screening or other coverage options, to number and placement of openings. Engineered openings ignore many of these requirements, depending on the particular regulatory authority. To qualify as an engineered opening, testing and/or certification by a qualified agency (varying from regulator to regulator, and indicated below where appropriate) is required.

Non-Engineered Opening WARNING: "Any louvers, blades, screens, and faceplates or other covers and devices should be selected or specified so as to minimize the likelihood of blockage by small debris and sediment. Where experience has shown that a particular device or type of device has been blocked or clogged by flood debris or sediment, use of such devices should be avoided." -ASCE 24-14 Pg. 45 (commentary)

===American Society of Civil Engineers definition===
The [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE) requirements apply to any structure that is not [[flood barrier#Local Flood Barriers|dry flood-proofed]] and which is in the [[flood insurance rate map|mapped]] flood zone. It calls for openings in [[load-bearing wall|load-bearing]] [[foundation wall]]s located below the mapped [[flood elevation]]. Where non-engineered openings are used, each opening must be at least three inches in diameter, and have no screen or other cover that interferes with the transition of water between interior and exterior. The total net open area of all flood openings in the structure must be equal to or greater than one square inch, per square foot of footprint of the enclosed area—though no fewer than two openings, total, which must be located on different walls. Openings must be placed such that the bottom of each opening is no more than one [[foot (unit)|foot]] above the adjacent ground level.&lt;ref name="ascesum"&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=3515 Highlights of ASCE 24-05 Flood Resistant Design and Construction]&lt;/ref&gt;

In lieu of these requirements, engineered openings must conform to a performance standard: during a flood with a rate of rise/fall of five feet  per hour, the difference between interior and exterior flood water levels in an enclosure using the engineered openings must not be greater than one foot.&lt;ref name="codes" /&gt;

===International Building Code (IBC)===
The [[International Building Code]] refers to the American Society of Civil Engineer requirements for both non-engineered and engineered flood openings.

===International Residential Code (IRC)===
The [[International Residential Code]] requirements vary mildly from revision to revision, but require that entry and exit of floodwater be provided for in accordance with the requirements of the ASCE.&lt;ref name="icode03"&gt;2003 International Residential Code, International Code Council, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icode06"&gt;2006 International Residential Code, International Code Council, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icode09"&gt;2009 International Residential Code, International Code Council, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; These requirements apply for both non-engineered and engineered flood openings.

===FEMA===
While the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] does not have [[de jure]] authority over the building code, it maintains crucial influence over flood opening standards through its administration of the [[National Flood Insurance Program]] (NFIP). By controlling the standards for nearly all [[flood insurance]] in the United States, the NFIP exerts exceptional [[de facto]] authority over many aspects of floodplain construction. The FEMA (and, thus, NFIP) requirements for non-engineered openings are similar to requirements from the American Society of Civil Engineers. Unlike the ASCE, FEMA requires the placement of openings such that the bottom of each opening is no more than one foot above the higher of the adjacent ground level, or the interior foundation slab height.&lt;ref name="tb1"&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=1579 FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-08: Openings in Foundation Walls and Walls of Enclosures]&lt;/ref&gt;

For engineered openings, FEMA offers two subclassifications: individual certification openings, and openings with [[International Code Council Evaluation Service]] (ICC-ES) Evaluation Reports. Individual certification openings are offered for use when, "[f]or architectural or other reasons, building designers or owners may prefer to use unique or individually designed openings or devices".&lt;ref name="tb1"/&gt; In such cases, an [[architect]] or [[engineer]] may provide certification including the professional's signature and applied [[seal (emblem)|seal]]. The certification must include a "statement certifying that the openings are designed to automatically equalize [[hydrostatic pressure|hydrostatic flood loads]] on exterior walls by allowing the automatic entry and exit of [[floodwater]]s in accordance with the...design requirements"; "[d]escription of the range of flood characteristics tested or computed for which the certification is valid, such as rates of rise and fall of floodwaters"; and "[d]escription of the installation requirements and limitations that, if not followed, will void the certification".&lt;ref name="tb1"/&gt; The nature of the "live seal" requirement means that each structure containing an individual certification opening must have a separate certification, even if the opening is identical to that used in another structure.

The alternative subclassification is an opening that carries certification through the ICC-ES. According to FEMA, "Evaluation Reports are issued only after the ICC-ES performs technical evaluations of documentation submitted by a manufacturer, including technical design reports, certifications, and testing that demonstrate code compliance and performance."&lt;ref name="tb1"/&gt; The report must include a statement concerning the purpose of the opening tested; a description of the characteristics tested; and a description of installation requirements. FEMA allows a copy of the report to be used as a blanket certification of any project including an ICC-ES certified opening, in contrast to the requirements of an individual certification opening.&lt;ref name="tb1"/&gt;

====AC364-1006-R1====
AC364-1006-R1 documents the ICC-ES's testing standards for flood openings, including specifications for a dual-chambered testing tank. While the requirements for the opening itself are based on ASCE 24, the substance of the test adds new layers of performance expectation. Under these requirements, the opening must activate before water level is one foot above the bottom of the opening, under conditions of 50 and 300 gallons per minute flooding, at a minimum of five foot per hour rate of rise. Additionally, water levels on the testing tank's "interior" and "exterior" portions must at no point differ more than one foot. To gauge performance against waterborne [[debris]], leaves and grass clippings are added to both chambers of the tank.&lt;ref name="ac364"&gt;[http://www.icc-es.org/Committee/0610-post/ac364.pdf AC364-1006-R1]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Food science''' is the [[applied science]] devoted to the study of [[food]]. The [[Institute of Food Technologists]] defines food science as "the discipline in which the engineering, biological, and physical sciences are used to study the nature of foods, the causes of deterioration, the principles underlying [[food processing]], and the improvement of foods for the consuming public".&lt;ref&gt;Heldman, Dennis R. "IFT and the Food Science Profession." ''Food Technology.'' October 2006. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The textbook ''Food Science'' defines food science in simpler terms as "the application of basic sciences and engineering to study the physical, chemical, and biochemical nature of foods and the principles of food processing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Food Science| series = Food science texts series|edition =5th| first1 = Norman N. |last1 = Potter| first2= Joseph H.| last2= Hotchkiss| publisher= Springer| year =1998| isbn= 9780834212657| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ERoAm13YF8IC&amp;dq=Food+science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities of food scientists include the development of new food products, design of processes to produce these foods, choice of packaging materials, [[shelf-life]] studies, sensory evaluation of products using [[survey panel]]s or potential consumers, as well as microbiological and chemical testing.&lt;ref name="ift.org Food Science Activity Guides"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ift.org/knowledge-center/learn-about-food-science/k12-outreach/activity-guides.aspx | title=Food Science Activity Guides | accessdate=February 2, 2015 | website=IFT.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food scientists may study more fundamental phenomena that are directly linked to the production of food products and its properties.

Food science brings together multiple scientific disciplines. It incorporates concepts from fields such as [[microbiology]], [[chemical engineering]], and [[biochemistry]].

==Disciplines==
Some of the subdisciplines of food science are described below.

===Food chemistry===
{{main article|Food chemistry}}
Food chemistry is the study of [[chemical]] processes and interactions of all biological and non-biological components of foods.&lt;ref&gt;John M. de Man.1999. ''Principles of Food Chemistry'' (Food Science Text Series), Springer Science, Third Edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John M. de Man. 2009. Food process engineering and technology, Academic Press, Elsevier: London and New York, 1st edn.&lt;/ref&gt; The biological substances include such items as [[meat]], [[poultry]], [[lettuce]], [[beer]], and [[milk]] as examples.
It is similar to [[biochemistry]] in its main components such as [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, and [[protein]], but it also includes areas such as water, [[vitamin]]s, [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], [[enzyme]]s, [[food additive]]s, [[flavor]]s, and [[Food coloring|colors]]. This discipline also encompasses how products change under certain [[food processing]] techniques and ways either to enhance or to prevent them from happening.

====Food physical chemistry====
{{main article|Food physical chemistry}}
Food physical chemistry is the study of both physical and chemical interactions in foods in terms of physical and chemical principles applied to food systems, as well as the application of physicochemical techniques and instrumentation for the study and analysis of foods.

===Food engineering===
{{main article|Food engineering}}
[[File:Factory Automation Robotics Palettizing Bread.jpg|thumb|A pizza factory in Germany, an example of [[food engineering]]]]
Food engineering is the industrial processes used to [[Food manufacture|manufacture food]].

===Food microbiology===
[[File:LUA, Faculty of Food Technology Food microbiology laboratory.jpg|thumbnail|[[Food microbiology]] laboratory at the [[Faculty of Food Technology, Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies|Faculty of Food Technology]], [[Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies]].]]
{{main article|Food microbiology}}
Food microbiology is the study of the [[microorganism]]s that inhabit, create, or [[Food contaminant|contaminate]] [[food]], including the study of microorganisms causing food spoilage.&lt;ref name=FratamicoBayles&gt;{{cite book | author = Fratamico PM and Bayles DO (editor). | title = Foodborne Pathogens: Microbiology and Molecular Biology | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2005 |  isbn = 978-1-904455-00-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Good" bacteria, however, such as [[probiotics]], are becoming increasingly important in food science.&lt;ref name=Tannockpro3&gt;{{cite book | author = Tannock GW (editor). | title = Probiotics and Prebiotics: Scientific Aspects | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2005 | isbn =  978-1-904455-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= LjunghWadstrom&gt;{{cite book |author= Ljungh A, Wadstrom T (editors)| year=2009 |title=Lactobacillus Molecular Biology: From Genomics to Probiotics | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-41-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= MayoB&gt;{{cite book |author= Mayo, B; van Sinderen, D (editor)| year=2010 |title=Bifidobacteria: Genomics and Molecular Aspects | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-904455-68-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, microorganisms are essential for the production of foods such as [[cheese]], [[yogurt]], [[bread]], [[beer]], [[wine]] and, other [[Fermentation in food processing|fermented foods]].

===Food packaging===
[[File:FoodScience-ex2.png|thumbnail|[[Food packaging]] in progress]]

===Food preservation===
{{main article|Food preservation}}
Food preservation involves the causes and prevention of quality spoilage

===Food substitution===
Food substitution refers to the replacement of fat, sugar, or calories from a product while maintaining similar shape, texture, color, or taste.

===Food technology===
{{main article|Food technology}}
Food technology is the technological aspects.
Early scientific research into food technology concentrated on food preservation. Nicolas Appert’s development in 1810 of the canning process was a decisive event.  The process wasn’t called canning then and Appert did not really know the principle on which his process worked, but canning has had a major impact on food preservation techniques.

===Molecular gastronomy===
{{main article|Molecular gastronomy}}
Molecular gastronomy is the scientific investigation of processes in cooking, social and artistic [[gastronomic]]al phenomena.
Molecular gastronomy is a subdiscipline of food science that seeks to investigate the physical and chemical transformations of ingredients that occur in cooking. Its program includes three axis, as cooking was recognized to have three components, which are social, artistic and technical.

===New product development===
{{main article|New product development}}
New product development includes the invention of new food products.

===Quality control===
{{main article|Quality control}}
[[File:FoodScience-ex3.png|thumbnail|A technician performing [[quality control]]]]

Quality control involves the causes, prevention and communication dealing with [[food-borne illness]]. 

Quality control also ensures that product meets specs to ensure the customer receives what they expect from the packaging to the physical properties of the product itself.

===Sensory analysis===
{{main article|Sensory analysis}}
Sensory analysis is the study of how consumers' senses perceive food.

==By country==

===Australia===
{{main|Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation}}
The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is the federal government agency for scientific research in [[Australia]]. CSIRO maintains more than 50 sites across Australia and biological control research stations in France and Mexico. It has nearly 6,500 employees.

===South Korea===
The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology, or KoSFoST, claims to be the first society in South Korea for food science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kosfost.or.kr/eng/|title=Korean Society of Food Science and Technology (KoSFoST)|publisher=KoSFoST |accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=February 2015}}

===United States===
In the United States, food science is typically studied at [[land-grant universities]]. Many of the country's pioneering food scientists were women who had attended chemistry programs at land-grant universities (which were state-run and largely under state mandates to allow for sex-blind admission), but then graduated and had difficulty finding jobs due to widespread sexism in the chemistry industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Finding conventional career paths blocked, they found alternative employment as instructors in [[home economics]] departments and used that as a base to launch the foundation of many modern food science programs.

The main US organization regarding food science and [[food technology]] is the [[Institute of Food Technologists]] (IFT), headquartered in [[Chicago, Illinois]], which is the US member organisation of the [[International Union of Food Science and Technology]] (IUFoST).

{{about|the nanotechnology policy organization|the similar-sounding craniofacial research institute|The Forsyth Institute}}
The '''Foresight Institute''' is a [[Palo Alto, California]]-based research [[nonprofit organization|non-profit]] dedicated to promoting the development of nanotechnology (and other emerging technologies).&lt;ref name="guston"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guston|first1=David H.|title=Encyclopedia of nanoscience and society|date=2010|publisher=SAGE|location=London|isbn=1452266174|page=253|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vyp1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA253&amp;dq=foresight+institute|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute holds conferences on [[molecular nanotechnology]]&lt;ref name="oliver"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oliver|first1=By Richard W.|title=The biotech age : the business of biotech and how to profit from it|date=2003|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=0071414894|page=86|edition=2nd ed., rev.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2u0euFAcOcwC&amp;dq=isbn%3A0071414894&amp;q=unbounding+future|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the independent foundations in the nanotechnology area.&lt;ref name="milburn"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Milburn|first1=Colin|title=Nanovision: Engineering the future|date=2008|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|location=Durham, N.C.|isbn=0822391481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Institute was founded in 1986 by author [[Christine Peterson]],&lt;ref name="oliver" /&gt; who still serves on the Board of Directors. Other founding members include [[molecular nanotechnology]] proponent [[K. Eric Drexler]] as president, and space entrepreneur [[James C. Bennett]]. Drexler's book, [[Engines of Creation]], was one of the institute's founding documents. Many of its initial members came from the [[L5 Society]]. It was first intended as a smaller, more focused group than L5, but grew rapidly and reached a few thousand members shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name="McCray"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCray|first1=W. Patrick|title=The visioneers: how a group of elite scientists pursued space colonies, nanotechnologies, and a limitless future|date=2012|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton|isbn=0691139830}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its early days, it was largely responsible for promoting the concept of nanotechnology, before the idea became widespread among researchers. 

Nanotech received little investment from government and industry in the early 1990s, a gap Foresight tried to fill through its private fundraising efforts.&lt;ref name="Berube" /&gt; Named to honor 1965 Nobel Prize winner in Physics, [[Richard Feynman]], the [[Foresight Institute Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology]] was started in 1993, with two prizes being awarded for theory and experimentation every year since 1997.&lt;ref name="marcovich"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marcovich|first1=Anne|last2=Shinn|first2=Terry|title=Toward a New Dimension: Exploring the Nanoscale|date=2014|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0198714610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, two sister organizations were formed: the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing (IMM) and the Center for Constitutional Issues in Technology (CCIT), with funding from tech entrepreneur [[Mitch Kapor]].&lt;ref name="McCray" /&gt; CCIT was founded to study policy issues, but communications professor [[David M. Berube]] argued in 2005 that it had not accomplished much in this area.&lt;ref name="Berube"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berube|first1=David M.|title=Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz|publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|isbn=9781615922369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, the Foresight Institute changed its name to "Foresight Nanotech Institute". &lt;ref name="milburn" /&gt; In June 2009 it reverted to the original.

Foresight and its founder Eric Drexler have been criticized for [[technological utopianism]] and unrealistic expectations.&lt;ref name="Byrne"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Byrne|title=Sidebar: Looking at Foresight|url=https://www.sfweekly.com/news/sidebar-looking-at-foresight/|accessdate=14 December 2016|publisher=[[SF Weekly]]|date=December 8, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford researcher [[Steven Block]] has called Foresight a "cult of futurists", and said that visions which might resemble [[science fiction]] would hold back research progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r73YIS9jSFYC&amp;pg=PT148&amp;q=%22cult%20of%20futurists%22&amp;f=false|title=Nanoculture: Implications of the New Technoscience|last=Hayles|first=N.

==Prizes==
{{main|Foresight Institute Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology}}&lt;p&gt;The Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology is an award given by the Foresight Institute for significant advances in [[nanotechnology]].  The prize was first given in 1993.  Before 1997, one prize was given biennially.  From 1997 on, two prizes were given each year in theory and experimental categories.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marcovich|first=Anne|last2=Shinn|first2=Terry|date=December 1, 2010|title=Socio/intellectual patterns in nanoscale research: Feynman Nanotechnology Prize laureates, 1993–2007|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0539018410377581|journal=Social Science Information|volume=49|issue=4|pages=615-638|doi=10.1177/0539018410377581|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Citation|title=Feynman Prize: Dr Amanda Barnard|date=2015-04-30|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/lifematters/feynman-prize3a-dr-amanda-barnard/6432694|publisher=ABC (Australia)|language=en-AU|accessdate=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/physics/a-quantum-leap|title=Michelle Simmons: a quantum queen|last=Finkel|first=Elizabeth|date=2016-09-26|website=Cosmos Magazine|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heinze|first=Thomas|last2=Shapira|first2=Philip|last3=Senker|first3=Jacqueline|last4=Kuhlmann|first4=Stefan|date=2007-01-01|title=Identifying creative research accomplishments: Methodology and results for nanotechnology and human genetics|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-007-0108-6|journal=Scientometrics|language=en|volume=70|issue=1|pages=125–152|doi=10.1007/s11192-007-0108-6|issn=0138-9130}}&lt;/ref&gt; By awarding these prizes early in the history of the field, the prize increased awareness of nanotechnology and influenced its direction.&lt;ref name="NewDim"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-78AwAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22Feynman%20prize%22%20OR%20%22Feynman%20nanotechnology%20prize%22|title=Toward a New Dimension: Exploring the Nanoscale|last=Marcovich|first=Anne|last2=Shinn|first2=Terry|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780198714613|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stallbaumer|first=Clayton|date=2016|title=From Longitude to Altitude: Inducement Prize Contests as Instruments of Public Policy in Science and Technology|url=http://illinoisjltp.com/journal/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/stallbaumer.pdf|journal=Journal of Law, Technology &amp; Policy|language=en-US|volume=2006|issue=1|pages=117—158|via=University of Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nano-Hype"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTPkmNLs870C&amp;pg=PA250|title=Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz|last=Berube|first=David M.|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=9781615922369|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prize is named in honor of physicist [[Richard Feynman]], whose 1959 talk ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]'' is considered to have inspired and informed the start of the field of nanotechnology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The prize was instituted in the context of Drexler's advocacy of funding for molecular manufacturing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Author Colin Milburn refers to the prize as an example of "fetishizing" their namesake [[Richard Feynman]], due to his prestige as a scientist and his fame among the broader public.&lt;ref name="milburn" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;The Foresight Institute also offers the Feynman Grand Prize, a $250,000 award to the first persons to create both a nanoscale robotic arm capable of precise positional control, and a nanoscale 8-bit adder, conforming to given specifications.

==Workshops==

The Institute carries out yearly workshops, attended primarily by scientists, engineers, and students. The subject matter matches molecular nanotechnology and its close relative, [[atomically precise manufacturing]] with other transformative technologies, such as energy efficiency, artificial intelligence, programmable matter, and medical applications. In 2016, the Institute initiated the first of a promised series of “Great Debates” on various technical, existential and ethical subjects related to impending outcomes of [[transformative research]] and technologies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25563">A '''function model''' or ''functional model'' in [[systems engineering]] and [[software engineering]] is a structured [[Representation (systemics)|representation]] of the [[Function (engineering)|functions]] ([[Activity diagram|activities]], [[Task analysis|actions]], [[wikt:process|process]]es, [[Operations management|operation]]s) within the modeled [[system]] or subject area.&lt;ref name= "ITL93"&gt;[http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/idef02.doc FIPS Publication 183] released of IDEFØ December 1993 by the Computer Systems Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:IDEF Diagram Example.jpg|thumb|360px|Example of a function model of the process of "Maintain Reparable Spares" in [[IDEF0]] notation.]]

A function model, similar with the [[activity diagram|activity model]] or [[process model]], is a graphical representation of an [[Business|enterprise]]'s function within a defined scope. The purposes of the function model are to describe the functions and processes, assist with discovery of information needs, help identify opportunities, and establish a basis for determining product and service costs.&lt;ref name="rmsc-1995"&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/era/pdf/rmsc-19951006-dod-rm-function-and-information-models.pdf Reader's Guide to IDEF0 Function Models]. Accessed 27 Nov 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The function model in the field of systems engineering and software engineering originates in the 1950s and 1960s, but the origin of functional modelling of organizational activity goes back to the late 19th century. 

In the late 19th century the first diagrams appeared that pictured business activities, actions, processes, or operations, and in the first half of the 20th century the first structured methods for documenting business process activities emerged. One of those methods was the [[flow process chart]], introduced by [[Frank Gilbreth]] to members of [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME) in 1921 with the presentation, entitled “Process Charts—First Steps in Finding the One Best Way”.&lt;ref name="BBG02"&gt;Ben B. Graham (2002). ''Detail Process Charting''. p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbreth's tools quickly found their way into [[industrial engineering]] curricula. 

The emergence of the field of ''systems engineering'' can be traced back to [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first to define the function model in this field was the British engineer [[William Gosling (engineer)|William Gosling]]. In his book ''The design of engineering systems'' (1962, p. 25) he stated:  
:''A functional model must thus achieve two aims in order to be of use. It must furnish a throughput description mechanics capable of completely defining the first and last throughput states, and perhaps some of the intervening states. It must also offer some means by which any input, correctly described in terms of this mechanics, can be used to generate an output which is an equally correct description of the output which the actual system would have given for the input concerned. It may also be noted that there are two other things which a functional model may do, but which are not necessary to all functional models. Thus such a system may, but need not, describe the system throughputs other than at the input and output, and it may also contain a description of the operation which each element carries out on the throughput, but once again this is not.''&lt;ref&gt;[[William Gosling (engineer)|William Gosling]] (1962) ''The design of engineering systems''. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first well defined function models, was the [[Functional Flow Block Diagram]] (FFBD) developed by the defense-related [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] Incorporated in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Weilkiens (2008). ''Systems Engineering with SysML/UML: Modeling, Analysis, Design''. Page 287.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s it was exploited by the [[NASA]] to visualize the time sequence of events in a space systems and flight missions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Chestnut]] (1967). ''Systems Engineering Methods''. Page 254.&lt;/ref&gt; It is further widely used in classical [[systems engineering]] to show the order of execution of system functions.&lt;ref name="TD03"&gt;Thomas Dufresne &amp; James Martin (2003). [http://mason.gmu.edu/~tdufresn/paper.doc "Process Modeling for E-Business"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220024049/http://mason.gmu.edu/~tdufresn/paper.doc |date=December 20, 2006 }}.

== Functional modeling topics ==

=== Functional perspective ===
In [[systems engineering]] and [[software engineering]] a function model is created with a functional [[Modeling perspectives|modeling perspective]]. The functional perspective is one of the perspectives possible in [[business process modelling]], other perspectives are for example behavioural, organisational or informational.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.jyu.fi/~jpt/ME2000/Me14/sld004.htm Process perspectives]. In: ''Metamodeling and method engineering'', Minna Koskinen, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

A functional modeling perspective concentrates on describing the [[dynamic system|dynamic process]]. The main concept in this modeling perspective is the process, this could be a function, transformation, activity, action, task etc. A well-known example of a modeling language employing this perspective is [[data flow diagram]]s.

The perspective uses four symbols to describe a process, these being:
*Process: Illustrates transformation from input to output.
*Store:	   Data-collection or some sort of material.
*Flow:	   Movement of data or material in the process.
*External Entity: External to the modeled system, but interacts with it.
Now, with these symbols, a process can be represented as a network of these symbols. This decomposed process is a DFD, data flow diagram.

[[File:Fo2ufg823rhf832hfdorfg.JPG|thumb|Example of functional decomposition in a systems analysis.]]In [[Dynamic Enterprise Modeling]] a division is made in the [[Control model]], Function Model, [[Process model]] and [[Organizational model]].

=== Functional decomposition ===
[[Functional decomposition]] refers broadly to the process of resolving a [[Function (mathematics)|functional]] relationship into its constituent parts in such a way that the original function can be reconstructed from those parts by [[function composition]]. In general, this process of decomposition is undertaken either for the purpose of gaining insight into the identity of the constituent components, or for the purpose of obtaining a compressed representation of the global function, a task which is feasible only when the constituent processes possess a certain level of ''modularity''. 

[[Decomposition (computer science)|Functional decomposition]] has a prominent role in [[computer programming]], where a major goal is to ''modularize'' processes to the greatest extent possible. For example, a library management system may be broken up into an inventory module, a patron information module, and a fee assessment module. In the early decades of computer programming, this was manifested as the "art of subroutining," as it was called by some prominent practitioners.

Functional decomposition of engineering systems is a method for analyzing engineered systems. The basic idea is to try to divide a system in such a way that each block of the block diagram can be described without an "and" or "or" in the description.

This exercise forces each part of the system to have a pure [[role|function]]. When a system is composed of pure functions, they can be reused, or replaced. A usual side effect is that the interfaces between blocks become simple and generic. Since the interfaces usually become simple, it is easier to replace a pure function with a related, similar function.

== Functional modeling methods ==
The functional approach is extended in multiple diagrammic techniques and modeling notations. This section gives an overview of the important techniques in chronological order.

=== Function block diagram ===
[[Image:Functional_block_diagram_of_the_attitude_control_and_maneuvering_electronics_system.jpg|thumb|320px|Functional block diagram of the attitude control and maneuvering electronics system of the [[Project_Gemini#Spacecraft|Gemini spacecraft]]. June 1962.]]
A [[functional block diagram]] is a [[block diagram]], that describes the functions and interrelationships of a [[system]]. The functional block diagram can picture:&lt;ref&gt;James Perozzo (1994) ''The complete guide to electronics troubleshooting''. p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

* Functions of a system pictured by blocks  
* Input and output elements of a block pictured with lines, and 
* Relationships between the functions 
* Functional sequences and paths for matter and or signals&lt;ref&gt;William H. Von Alven (1964) ''Reliability engineering'' explains: "Functional block diagrams show functional sequences and signal paths, and items which are wired in parallel are drawn in parallel" (p. 286)&lt;/ref&gt;
The block diagram can use additional schematic symbols to show particular properties.

Specific function block diagram are the classic [[Functional Flow Block Diagram]], and the [[Function Block Diagram]] (FBD) used in the design of [[programmable logic controller]]s.

=== Functional Flow Block Diagram ===
[[File:Functional Flow Block Diagram Format.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Functional Flow Block Diagram]] Format.&lt;ref name="SEF01"&gt;[http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203501/http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf |date=September 27, 2007 }} Defense Acquisition University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Functional flow block diagram]] (FFBD) is a multi-tier, time-sequenced, step-by-step [[flow diagram]] of the [[system]]’s functional flow.&lt;ref name="faa.gov"&gt;The first version of this article is completely based on the [http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/operations/sysengsaf/seman/SEM3.1/Section%204.4.pdf NAS SYSTEM ENGINEERING MANUAL SECTION] 4.4 VERSION 3.1 06/06/06.&lt;/ref&gt;
The diagram is developed in the 1950s and widely used in classical [[systems engineering]]. The Functional Flow Block Diagram is also referred to as ''Functional Flow Diagram'', ''functional block diagram'', and ''functional flow''.&lt;ref name="FAA08"&gt;[http://www.hf.faa.gov/webtraining/Usability/u17_tools2.htm Task Analysis Tools Used Throughout Development]. FAA 2008. Retrieved 25 Sept 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional Flow Block Diagrams (FFBD) usually define the detailed, step-by-step operational and support sequences for [[system]]s, but they are also used effectively to define [[wikt:process|process]]es in developing and producing systems. The [[software development process]]es also use FFBDs extensively. In the system context, the functional flow steps may include combinations of [[computer hardware|hardware]], [[software]], [[personnel]], facilities, and/or procedures. 

In the FFBD method, the functions are organized and depicted by their logical order of execution. Each function is shown with respect to its logical relationship to the execution and completion of other functions. A node labeled with the function name depicts each function. Arrows from left to right show the order of execution of the functions. Logic symbols represent sequential or parallel execution of functions.&lt;ref name="FAA06"&gt;FAA (2006). [http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/operations/sysengsaf/seman/SEM3.1/Section%204.4.pdf NAS SYSTEM ENGINEERING MANUAL SECTION] 4.4 VERSION 3.1 06/06/06.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HIPO and oPO ===
[[File:IPO-S Model.gif|thumb|180px|left|An expanded [[IPO Model]].]]
[[HIPO]] for ''hierarchical input process output'' is a popular 1970s [[systems analysis]] design aid and documentation technique&lt;ref&gt;IBM Corporation (1974).''HIPO—A Design Aid and Documentation Technique'', Publication Number GC20-1851, IBM Corporation, White Plains, NY, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; for representing the modules of a [[system]] as a [[hierarchy]] and for documenting each module.&lt;ref name="Sandia92"&gt;Sandia National Laboratories (1992). [http://www.prod.sandia.gov/cgi-bin/techlib/access-control.pl/1985/852348.pdf Sandia Software Guidelines Volume 5 Tools, Techniques,and Methodologies] SANDIA REPORTS 85–2348qUC–32&lt;/ref&gt;  

It was used to develop requirements, construct the design, and support implementation of an expert system to demonstrate automated rendezvous. Verification was then conducted systematically because of the method of design and implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ann Goodwin and Charles C. Robertson (1986). [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19880007850_1988007850.pdf EXPERT SYSTEM VERIFICATION CONCERNS IN AN OPERATIONS ENVIRONMENT]. NASA paper N88-17234.&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall design of the system is documented using HIPO charts or [[structure chart]]s. The structure chart is similar in appearance to an organizational chart, but has been modified to show additional detail. Structure charts can be used to display several types of information, but are used most commonly to diagram either [[data structure]]s or code structures.&lt;ref name="Sandia92"/&gt;

=== N2 Chart ===
[[File:N2 chart definition.JPG|thumb|240px|Figure 2. N2 chart definition.&lt;ref name="NASA95"/&gt;]]
The [[N2 Chart]] is a diagram in the shape of a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], representing functional or physical interfaces between system elements. It is used to systematically identify, define, tabulate, design, and analyze functional and physical interfaces. It applies to system [[interface (computing)|interface]]s and [[computer hardware|hardware]] and/or [[software]] interfaces.&lt;ref name="faa.gov"/&gt; 

The N2 diagram has been used extensively to develop data interfaces, primarily in the [[software]] areas. However, it can also be used to develop hardware interfaces. The basic N2 chart is shown in Figure 2. The system functions are placed on the diagonal; the remainder of the squares in the N x N matrix represent the interface inputs and outputs.

=== Structured Analysis and Design Technique ===
[[File:SADT.svg|thumb|180px|left|SADT basis element.]]
[[Structured Analysis and Design Technique]] (SADT) is a [[software engineering methodology]] for describing [[system]]s as a hierarchy of functions, a [[diagram]]matic notation for constructing a sketch for a software application. It offers building blocks to represent entities and activities, and a variety of arrows to relate boxes. These boxes and arrows have an associated informal [[semantics]].&lt;ref name ="JM04"&gt;[[John Mylopoulos]] (2004). [http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jm/2507S/Notes04/SADT.pdf Conceptual Modelling III. Structured Analysis and Design Technique (SADT)]. Retrieved 21 Sep 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; SADT can be used as a functional analysis tool of a given process, using successive levels of details. The SADT method allows to define user needs for IT developments, which is used in industrial Information Systems, but also to explain and to present an activity’s manufacturing processes, procedures.&lt;ref name="FL"&gt;[http://www.free-logistics.com/index.php/Download-document/22-SADT_eng.html SADT] at Free-logistics.com. Retrieved 21 Sep 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SADT supplies a specific functional view of any enterprise by describing the functions and their relationships in a company. These functions fulfill the objectives of a company, such as sales, order planning, product design, part manufacturing, and human resource management. The SADT can depict simple functional relationships and can reflect data and control flow relationships between different functions. The [[IDEF0]] formalism is based on SADT, developed by [[Douglas T. Ross]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Gavriel Salvendy (2001). ''Handbook of Industrial Engineering: Technology and Operations Management.''. p.508.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IDEF0 ===
[[File:IDEF Diagram Example.jpg|thumb|320px|[[IDEF0]] Diagram Example]]
[[IDEF0]] is a [[function modeling]] methodology for describing [[manufacturing]] functions, which offers a functional [[modeling language]] for the analysis, development, re-engineering, and integration of [[information system]]s; business processes; or software engineering analysis.&lt;ref name="DAC01"&gt;[http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203501/http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf |date=September 27, 2007 }} Defense Acquisition University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the [[IDEF]] family of modeling languages in the field of [[software engineering]], and is built on the functional modeling language building [[Structured Analysis and Design Technique|SADT]].

The IDEF0 Functional Modeling method is designed to model the decisions, actions, and activities of an organization or system.&lt;ref name = "VG00"/&gt;  It was derived from the established graphic modeling language [[Structured Analysis and Design Technique]] (SADT) developed by [[Douglas T. Ross]] and [[SofTech, Inc.]]. In its original form, IDEF0 includes both a definition of a graphical modeling language ([[syntax]] and [[semantics]]) and a description of a comprehensive methodology for developing models.&lt;ref name= "ITL93"/&gt; The US Air Force commissioned the SADT developers to develop a function model method for analyzing and communicating the functional perspective of a system. IDEF0 should assist in organizing system analysis and promote effective communication between the analyst and the customer through simplified graphical devices.&lt;ref name = "VG00"&gt;[[Varun Grover]], [[William J. Kettinger]] (2000). ''Process Think: Winning Perspectives for Business Change in the Information Age. p.168.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Axiomatic Design ===
[[Axiomatic design]] is a top down hierarchical functional decomposition process used as a solution synthesis framework for the analysis, development, re-engineering, and integration of products, information systems, business processes or software engineering solutions.&lt;ref name="AD"&gt;Suh (2001).

In the field of systems and software engineering numerous specific function and functional models and close related models have been defined. Here only a few general types will be explained.

=== Business function model ===
A ''Business Function Model'' (BFM) is a general description or category of operations performed routinely to carry out an organization's mission. They "provide a conceptual structure for the identification of general business functions".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Grefen (2010) ''Mastering e-Business''. p. 5-10&lt;/ref&gt; It can show the critical [[business process]]es in the context of the business area functions. The processes in the business function model must be consistent with the processes in the value chain models. Processes are a group of related business activities performed to produce an end product or to provide a service. Unlike business functions that are performed on a continual basis, processes are characterized by the fact that they have a specific beginning and an end point marked by the delivery of a desired output. The figure on the right depicts the relationship between the business processes, business functions, and the business area’s business reference model.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Interior (2000-08) ''Analyze the Business and Define the Target Business Environment''. Accessed 27 Nov 2008.&lt;!-- Now no longer online--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business Process Model and Notation ===
[[Image:BPMN-AProcesswithNormalFlow.svg|thumb|320px|[[Business Process Modeling Notation]] Example.]]
[[Business Process Model and Notation]] (BPMN) is a [[Information visualisation|graphical representation]] for specifying [[business process]]es in a [[workflow]]. BPMN was developed by [[Business Process Management Initiative]] (BPMI), and is currently maintained by the [[Object Management Group]] since the two organizations merged in 2005. The current version of BPMN is 2.0.&lt;ref name="bpmifaq"&gt;{{cite web|author= |title=BPMN Information|url=http://www.bpmn.org/Documents/FAQ.htm|accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) specification provides a graphical notation for specifying [[business process]]es in a [[Business Process Diagram]] (BPD).&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Simpson (2004). [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050202022_2005202152.pdf ''An XML Representation for Crew Procedures'']. Final Report NASA Faculty Fellowship Program - 2004. Johnson Space Center.&lt;/ref&gt;  The objective of BPMN is to support business process management for both technical users and business users by providing a notation that is intuitive to business users yet able to represent complex process semantics. The BPMN specification also provides a mapping between the graphics of the notation to the underlying constructs of execution languages, particularly [[BPEL4WS]].&lt;ref&gt;S.A. White, "Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN)," In: ''Business Process Management Initiative (BPMI)'' 3 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business reference model ===
[[Image:FEA BRM Hierachy.JPG|thumb|320px|This FEA [[Business reference model]] depicts the relationship between the business processes, business functions, and the business area’s business reference model.]]
A [[Business reference model]] is a reference model, concentrating on the functional and organizational aspects of the [[core business]] of an [[Business|enterprise]], [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service organization]] or [[government agency]]. In enterprise engineering a business reference model is part of an [[Enterprise Architecture Framework]] or ''Architecture Framework'', which defines how to organize the structure and [[view model|views]] associated with an [[Enterprise Architecture]].  

A [[reference model]] in general is a model of something that embodies the basic goal or idea of something and can then be looked at as a reference for various purposes. A business reference model is a means to describe the [[business operations]] of an organization, independent of the [[organizational structure]] that perform them. Other types of business reference model can also depict the relationship between the [[business process]]es, business functions, and the [[business area]]’s business reference model. These reference model can be constructed in layers, and offer a foundation for the analysis of service components, technology, data, and performance.

=== Operator function model ===
The ''Operator Function Model'' (OFM) is proposed as an alternative to traditional [[task analysis]] techniques used by [[human factors]] engineers. An operator function model attempts to represent in mathematical form how an operator might decompose a complex system into simpler parts and coordinate control actions and system configurations so that acceptable overall system performance is achieved. The model represents basic issues of knowledge representation, information flow, and decision making in complex systems. Miller (1985) suggests that the network structure can be thought of as a possible representation of an operator's [[Mental model|internal model]] of the system plus a control structure which specifies how the model is used to solve the decision problems that comprise operator control functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hf.faa.gov/workbenchtools/default.aspx?rPage=Tooldetails&amp;toolID=192 Operator Function Model (OFM)]. Accessed 27 Nov 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;

The glass gains its surface strength, ability to contain flaws, and crack-resistance by being immersed in a proprietary, hot potassium salt ion-exchange bath.

Corning experimented with chemically strengthened glass in 1960, as part of a "Project Muscle" initiative. Within a few years they had developed a "muscled glass"&lt;ref name="muscled"&gt;{{cite web | title = Gorilla Glass, the Smartphone's Unsung Hero | work = The New York Times | first = David | last = Pogue | date = December 9, 2010 | url = http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/gorilla-glass-the-smartphones-unsung-hero/ | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130115030748/http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/gorilla-glass-the-smartphones-unsung-hero/ | archivedate = January 15, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; marketed  as ''Chemcor''.

== Manufacture ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5197">In [[statistical mechanics]] of continuous systems, a potential for a many-body system is called '''H-stable''' (or simply '''stable''') if the [[potential energy]] per particle is bounded below by a constant that is independent of the total number of particles. In many circumstances, if a potential is not H-stable, it is not possible to define a [[grand canonical ensemble|grand canonical]] partition function in finite volume, because of ''catastrophic configurations'' with infinite particles located in a finite space.

==Classical statistical mechanics==

===Definition===
Consider a system of particles in positions &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2,\ldots \in R^\nu&lt;/math&gt;; the ''interaction'' or ''potential'' between a particle in position &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; and a particle in position &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; is 
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(x_i-x_j) \, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a real,  even (possibly unbounded)  function. Then &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is H-stable if there exists &lt;math&gt;B&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that,  for any &lt;math&gt;n\ge1&lt;/math&gt; and any &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n\in R^\nu&lt;/math&gt;, 
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(x_1, x_2,\ldots x_n):=\sum_{i&lt;j=1}^n  \phi(x_i-x_j)\ge-Bn\, &lt;/math&gt;

===Applications===
* If &lt;math&gt;\phi(0)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; and, for every &lt;math&gt;n\ge 1&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2,\ldots x_n\in R^\nu&lt;/math&gt;, it holds
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i,j=1}^n  \phi(x_i-x_j)\ge0
&lt;/math&gt;
:then the potential &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is stable (with the constant &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;\frac{\phi(0)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;). This condition applies for example to potentials that are: a) positive functions; b) [[positive-definite function]]s.

* If the potential &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is  stable, then, for any bounded domain &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;, any &lt;math&gt;\beta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the series
::&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{n\ge 1}\frac{z^n}{n!} 
\int_{\Lambda^n}\!dx_1\cdots dx_n\; 
\exp[-\beta V_n(x_1, x_2,\ldots x_n)]
&lt;/math&gt;
: is convergent. In fact, for bounded, upper-semi-continuous potentials the hypothesis is not only sufficient, but also necessary!

*The [[grand canonical ensemble|grand canonical]] partition function, in finite volume, is
::&lt;math&gt; \Xi(\beta, z, \Lambda):=1+\sum_{n\ge 1}\frac{z^n}{n!} 
\int_{\Lambda^n}\!dx_1\cdots dx_n\; 
\exp[-\beta V_n(x_1, x_2,\ldots x_n)]
&lt;/math&gt;
:hence the H-stability is a sufficient condition for the partition function to exists ''in finite volume''.

* H-stability doesn't  necessary imply the existence of the ''infinite volume'' pressure. For example, in a [[Coulomb system]] (in dimension three) the potential is
::&lt;math&gt; 
\phi(x)=\frac{1}{4\pi|x|} 
&lt;/math&gt;
:and, if the charges of all the particles are equal, then the potential energy is
::&lt;math&gt; 
V_n(x_1,\ldots, x_n)=\sum_{i&lt;j} \phi(x_i-x_j)
&lt;/math&gt;
: and the system is H-stable with &lt;math&gt;B=0&lt;/math&gt;; but the thermodynamic limit doesn't exist, because the potential is not [[tempered potential|tempered]].

* If the potential is not bounded, H-stability is not a necessary condition for the existence of the [[grand canonical ensemble|grand canonical]] partition function in finite volume. For example, in the case  of Yukawa interaction in two dimensions,
::&lt;math&gt; 
\phi(x)\sim-\frac{1}{2\pi}\ln{m|x|} \qquad
{\rm for}\quad x\sim 0
&lt;/math&gt;
:if the particles can have charges with different signs, the potential  energy is
::&lt;math&gt; 
H_n(\underline q, \underline x)=\sum_{i&lt;j} q_i q_j\phi(x_i-x_j)
&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;q_j&lt;/math&gt; is the charge of the particle &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;H_n(\underline q, \underline x)&lt;/math&gt; in not bounded from below: for example,  when &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_1q_2=1&lt;/math&gt;, the two body potential has infimum
::&lt;math&gt;
\inf_{x_1, x_2}  \phi(x_1-x_2)=-\infty
&lt;/math&gt;
:Yet, Frohlich&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frohlich|first=J.|title=Classical and quantum statistical mechanics in one and two dimensions: Two-component Yukawa and Coulomb systems|journal=Comm. Math. Phys.|year=1976|volume=47|doi=10.1007/bf01609843|bibcode=1976CMaPh..47..233F}}&lt;/ref&gt;  proved the existence of the thermodynamics limit for &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt; 4\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

==Quantum statistical mechanics==
The notion of H-stability in [[quantum mechanics]] is more subtle. 
While in the classical case the kinetic part of the Hamiltonian is not important as it can be zero independently of the position of the particles, in the quantum case the kinetic term plays an important role in the lower bound for the total energy because of the [[uncertainty principle]]. (In fact, stability of matter was the historical reason for introducing such a principle in mechanics.)
The definition of stability is :

: &lt;math&gt;\exists B: \frac{E_0}{N} &gt; -B, \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[ground state]] energy.

Classical H-stability implies quantum H-stability, but the converse is false.

The criterion is especially useful in [[statistical mechanics]], where H-stability is necessary to the existence of [[thermodynamics]], i.e. if a system is not H-stable, the [[thermodynamic limit]] does not exist.

'''Health geography''' is the application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of [[health]], [[disease]], and [[health care]].

== Overview ==

The study of health geography has been influenced by repositioning medical geography within the field of [[social geography]] due to a shift towards a social model in health care, rather than a medical model&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 &lt;/ref&gt;. This advocates for the redefinition of health and health care away from prevention and treatment of illness only to one of promoting well-being in general.  Under this model, some previous illnesses (e.g., mental ill health) are recognized as behavior disturbances only, and other types of medicine (e.g., complementary or [[alternative medicine]] and [[traditional medicine]]) are studied by the [[medicine]] researchers, sometimes with the aid of health geographers without [[medical education]]. This shift changes the definition of care, no longer limiting it to spaces such as hospitals or doctor's offices. Also, the social model gives priority to the intimate encounters performed at non-traditional spaces of medicine and healthcare as well as to the individuals as [[health consumerism|health consumers]].&lt;ref name= "Philo2"&gt;Philo, Chris (2009). "Health and Health Care". In Gregory, Derek; Johnston, Ron; Pratt, Geraldine et. al ''The Dictionary of Human Geography (Fifth Edition)''. Oxford:Blackwell. pp.325-326&lt;/ref&gt;

This alternative methodological approach means that medical geography is broadened to incorporate philosophies such as [[Political Economy#Current approaches|Marxian political economy]], [[structuralism]], [[interactionism|social interactionism]], [[humanism]], [[feminism]] and [[queer theory]].&lt;ref name= "Philo"&gt;Philo, Chris (2009). "Medical Geography". In Gregory, Derek; Johnston, Ron; Pratt, Geraldine et. al ''The Dictionary of Human Geography (Fifth Edition)''. Oxford:Blackwell. pp.451-453&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The relationship between space and health dates back to [[Hippocrates]], who stated that "airs, waters, places" all played significant roles impacting human health and history.&lt;ref name= "Philo" /&gt; A classic piece of research in health geography was done in 1854 as [[Broad Street cholera outbreak|a cholera outbreak]] gripped a neighborhood in [[London]]. Death tolls rang around the clock and the people feared that they were being infected by vapors coming from the ground. [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] predicted that if he could locate the source of the disease, it could be contained. He drew maps demonstrating the homes of people who had died of cholera and the locations of water pumps. He found that one pump, the public pump on Broad Street, was central to most of the victims. He concluded that infected water from the pump was the culprit.  He instructed the authorities to remove the handle to the pump, making it unusable. As a result, the number of new cholera cases decreased.

==Areas of study==
Health geography is considered to be divided into two distinct elements. The first of which is focused on geographies of disease and ill health, involving [[descriptive research]] quantifying disease frequencies and distributions, and [[Analytic and enumerative statistical studies|analytic research]] concerned with finding what characteristics make an individual or [[population]] susceptible to disease. This requires an understanding of [[epidemiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ocaña-Riola |first=Ricardo |year=2010 |title=Common errors in disease mapping |journal=Geospatial Health |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=139–54 |pmid=20503184 |url=http://www.geospatialhealth.unina.it/fulltext.php?f=pdf&amp;ida=90 |doi=10.4081/gh.2010.196}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second component of health geography is the geography of health care, primarily facility location, accessibility, and utilization.  This requires the use of [[spatial analysis]] and often borrows from [[behavioral economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/1353-8292(95)00002-4 | title=Coming out: exposing social theory in medical geography | journal=Health | date=1995 | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=5–14 | first=Andréa | last=Litva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geographies of disease and ill health ===
Hsenting health risks, from [[natural disaster]]s, to interpersonal [[violence]], [[stress (biology)|stress]], and other potential dangers.&lt;ref name="Philo2" /&gt;

=== Geography of health care provision ===
[[File:Coverage by Type of Health Insurance- 2008 and 2009p25.pdf|thumb]]
Although healthcare is a public good, it is not equally available to all [[individuals]]. Demand for public services is continuously increasing. People need advance knowledge and the latest prediction technology, that health geography offers. The latest example of such technology is Telemedicine. Many people in the United States are not able to access proper healthcare because of inequality in health insurance and the means to afford medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/02/money-quality-health-care-longer-life/|title=The costs of inequality: Money = quality health care = longer life|newspaper=Harvard Gazette|access-date=2017-02-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobility and Disease Tracking

With the advent of mobile technology and its spread, it is now possible to track [[individual mobility]]. By correlating the movement of individuals through tracking the devices using access towers or other tracking systems, it is now possible to determine and even control disease spread. While [[privacy law]]s question the legality of tracking individuals, the commercial mobile service providers are using covert techniques or obtaining government waivers to allow permission to track people .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30218">'''Homochirality''' is a uniformity of [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]], or handedness. Objects are ''chiral'' when they cannot be superposed on their mirror images. For example, the left and right hands of a human are approximately mirror images of each other but are not their own mirror images, so they are ''chiral''. In [[biology]], 19 of the 20 natural [[amino acid]]s are homochiral, being &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-chiral (left-handed), while [[sugar]]s are &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-chiral (right-handed).&lt;ref name="Lehninger"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nelson, Lehninger et al |title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry |date=2008 |publisher=Macmillan |page=474}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Homochirality'' can also refer to ''enantiomerically pure'' substances in which all the constituents are the same [[enantiomer]] (a right-handed or left-handed version of an atom or molecule), but some sources discourage this use of the term.

It is unclear whether homochirality has a purpose, however, it appears to be a form of information storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=James D.|title=A new definition of life|journal=Chirality|date=March 2009|volume=21|issue=3|pages=354–358|doi=10.1002/chir.20590|pmid=18571800}}&lt;/ref&gt; One suggestion is that it reduces [[entropy]] barriers in the formation of large organized molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Julian|first1=Ryan R.|last2=Myung|first2=Sunnie|last3=Clemmer|first3=David E.|title=Do Homochiral Aggregates Have an Entropic Advantage?|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry B|date=January 2005|volume=109|issue=1|pages=440–444|doi=10.1021/jp046478x|pmid=16851034}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been experimentally verified that amino acids form large aggregates in larger abundance from [[enantiopure]] substrates than from [[racemic]] ones.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

It is not clear whether homochirality emerged before or after life, and many mechanisms for its origin have been proposed.&lt;ref name=jafarpour2017 /&gt; Some of these models propose three distinct steps: ''mirror-symmetry breaking'' creates a minute enantiomeric imbalance, ''chiral amplification'' builds on this imbalance, and ''chiral transmission'' is the transfer of chirality from one set of molecules to another.

==In biology==

Amino acids are the building blocks of [[peptide]]s and [[enzyme]]s while sugar-peptide chains are the backbone of [[RNA]] and [[DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reusch|first1=William|title=Peptides &amp; Proteins|url=https://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/virttxtjml/protein2.htm|website=Natural Products|publisher=Michigan State University|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lam|first1=Eric|chapter=Nucleic acids and proteins|editor-last1=Dey|editor-first1=P.M.|editor-last2=Harborne|editor-first2=J.B.|title=Plant Biochemistry.|date=1997|publisher=Elsevier|location=Burlington|isbn=9780080525723|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In biological organisms, amino acids appear almost exclusively in the left-handed form (&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids) and sugars in the right-handed form (R-sugars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zubay |first1=Geoffrey |title=Origins of Life: On Earth and in the Cosmos |date=2000 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9780080497617 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=August 2018}} Since the enzymes catalyze reactions, they enforce homochirality on a great variety of other chemicals, including [[hormone]]s, toxins, fragrances and food flavors.&lt;ref name=Seckbach&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seckbach|first1=edited by Joseph|title=Genesis - in the beginning : precursors of life, chemical models and early biological evolution|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9789400729407}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|493&amp;ndash;494}} [[Glycine]] is achiral, as are some other non-[[proteinogenic]] amino acids are either achiral (such as [[dimethylglycine]]) or of the &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; enantiomeric form.

Biological organisms easily discriminate between molecules with different chiralities. This can affect physiological reactions such as smell and taste. [[Carvone]], a [[terpenoid]] found in [[essential oil]]s, smells like mint in its L-form and [[caraway]] in its R-form.&lt;ref name=Seckbach/&gt;{{rp|494}}{{verify source|date=August 2018}} [[Limonene]] tastes like lemons when right-handed and oranges when left-handed.&lt;ref name=Hazen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hazen|first1=Robert M.|author-link=Robert Hazen|title=Genesis : the scientific quest for life's origins|date=2007|publisher=Joseph Henry|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780309103107}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|168}}

Homochirality also affects the response to drugs. [[Thalidomide]], in its left-handed form, cures [[morning sickness]]; in its right-handed form, it causes birth defects.&lt;ref name=Hazen/&gt;{{rp|168}} Unfortunately, even if a pure left-handed version is administered, some of it can convert to the right-handed form in the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Silas|title=Chiral Toxicology: It's the Same Thing...

Depending on the manufacturing process, enantiopure forms can be more expensive to produce than stereochemical mixtures.&lt;ref name=Hazen/&gt;{{rp|168}}

Chiral preferences can also be found at a macroscopic level. Snail shells can be right-turning or left-turning helices, but one  form or the other is strongly preferred in a given species.

==Origins==
===Symmetry breaking===
Known mechanisms for the production of non-racemic mixtures from racemic starting materials include: asymmetric physical laws, such as the [[electroweak interaction]]; asymmetric environments, such as those caused by [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] light, [[Quartz|quartz crystal]]s, or the Earth's rotation; and statistical fluctuations during racemic synthesis.&lt;ref name="Plasson2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Plasson |first1=Raphaël |last2=Kondepudi |first2=Dilip K. |last3=Bersini |first3=Hugues |last4=Commeyras |first4=Auguste |last5=Asakura |first5=Kouichi |display-authors=3 |date=August 2007 |title=Emergence of homochirality in far-from-equilibrium systems: Mechanisms and role in prebiotic chemistry |journal=[[Chirality (journal)|Chirality]] |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=589–600 |doi=10.1002/chir.20440 |issn=0899-0042 |pmid=17559107}} "Special Issue: Proceedings from the Eighteenth International Symposium on Chirality (ISCD-18), Busan, Korea, 2006"&lt;/ref&gt; Once established, chirality would be selected for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=Stuart |authorlink=Stuart Clark (author) |date=July–August 1999 |title=Polarized Starlight and the Handedness of Life |journal=[[American Scientist]] |volume=87 |issue=4 |page=336 |bibcode=1999AmSci..87..336C |doi=10.1511/1999.4.336 |issn=0003-0996}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small [[enantiomeric excess]] can be amplified into a large one by [[Autocatalysis#Asymmetric autocatalysis|asymmetric autocatalysis]], such as in the [[Soai reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shibata |first1=Takanori |last2=Morioka |first2=Hiroshi |last3=Hayase |first3=Tadakatsu |last4=Choji |first4=Kaori |last5=Soai |first5=Kenso |display-authors=3 |date=17 January 1996 |title=Highly Enantioselective Catalytic Asymmetric Automultiplication of Chiral Pyrimidyl Alcohol |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=118 |issue=2 |pages=471–472 |doi=10.1021/ja953066g |issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; In asymmetric autocatalysis, the catalyst is a chiral molecule, which means that a chiral molecule is catalysing its own production. An initial enantiomeric excess, such as can be produced by polarized light, then allows the more abundant enantiomer to outcompete the other.&lt;ref name="Soai2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soai |first1=Kenso |last2=Sato |first2=Itaru |last3=Shibata |first3=Takanori |year=2001 |title=Asymmetric autocatalysis and the origin of chiral homogeneity in organic compounds |journal=The Chemical Record |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=321–332 |doi=10.1002/tcr.1017 |issn=1528-0691 |pmid=11893072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One supposition is that the discovery of an enantiomeric imbalance in molecules in the [[Murchison meteorite]] supports an extraterrestrial origin of homochirality: there is evidence for the existence of [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized light]] originating from [[Mie scattering]] on aligned interstellar dust particles which may trigger the formation of an [[enantiomeric excess]] within chiral material in space.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich/&gt;{{rp|123&amp;ndash;124}} Interstellar and near-stellar magnetic fields can align dust particles in this fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Helman |first=Daniel S |date=6 July 2018 |title=Galactic Distribution of Chirality Sources of Organic Molecules |journal=Acta Astronautica |volume=151 |pages=595–602 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.07.008 |issn=0094-5765|bibcode=2018AcAau.151..595H |arxiv=1612.06720 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another speculation (the Vester-Ulbricht hypothesis) suggests that fundamental chirality of physical processes such as that of the beta decay (see [[Parity (physics)|Parity violation]]) leads to slightly different half-lives of biologically relevant molecules. Homochirality may also result from [[spontaneous absolute asymmetric synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guava.physics.uiuc.edu/~nigel/courses/569/Essays_Fall2006/files/Rajan.pdf|title=How did protein amino acids get left-handed while sugars got right-handed?|first=Aruna|last=Rajan|publisher=Term Paper for Physics 569*|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soai_interview&gt;{{cite journal | journal= Highlights in Chemical Science |year= 2008 |issue= 5 |url= http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2008/05/Kenso_Soai_interview.asp |title= Interview: In the beginning... |accessdate=June 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible that homochirality is simply a result of the natural autoamplification process of life—that either the formation of life as preferring one chirality or the other was a chance rare event which happened to occur with the chiralities we observe, or that all chiralities of life emerged rapidly but due to catastrophic events and strong competition, the other unobserved chiral preferences were wiped out by the preponderance and metabolic, enantiomeric enrichment from the 'winning' chirality choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ermann |first1=L |title=Homochirality: the key to unlocking the origin of life? |journal=Applied Theoretical Biology |date=2013 |volume=7 |issue=10 |pages=21–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of chirality consensus as a natural autoamplification process has been associated with the [[2nd law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cause of chirality consensus | author= Jaakkola, S., Sharma, V. and Annila, A.| journal = Curr.

===Amplification===
====Theory====
[[File:Frank's model phase portrait.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Phase portrait of Frank's model: starting from almost everywhere in &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; plane (except &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; = &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; line), the system approaches to one of the homochiral states]]
In 1953, [[Frederick Charles Frank|Charles Frank]] proposed a model to demonstrate that homochirality is a consequence of [[autocatalysis]].&lt;ref name="frank1953"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frank |first1=F.C. |year=1953 |title=On spontaneous asymmetric synthesis |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=11 |pages=459–463 |doi=10.1016/0006-3002(53)90082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his model the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; enantiomers of a chiral molecule are autocatalytically produced from an achiral molecule A

:A + &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; → 2&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;,{{pad}}A + &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; → 2&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;

while suppressing each other through a reaction that he called ''mutual antagonism''

:&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; → ∅.
In this model the racemic state is unstable in the sense that the slightest enantiomeric excess will be amplified to a completely homochiral state. This can be shown by computing the reaction rates from the [[law of mass action]]:
:&lt;math chem&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d[\ce L]}{dt}  &amp;= k_a [\ce L] - k_d \ce{[L] [D]}\\
\frac{d[\ce D]}{dt}  &amp;= k_a [\ce D] - k_d \ce{[L] [D]},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;k_a&lt;/math&gt; is the rate constant for the autocatalytic reactions, &lt;math&gt;k_d&lt;/math&gt; is the rate constant for mutual antagonism reaction, and the concentration of A is kept constant for simplicity. By defining the enantiomeric excess &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math chem&gt;\Phi = \frac{[\ce D] - [\ce L]}{[\ce D] + [\ce L]},&lt;/math&gt;
we can compute the rate of change of enatiomeric excess using [[chain rule]] from the rate of change of the concentrations of enantiomeres &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;.
:&lt;math chem&gt;
\frac{d\Phi}{dt} = \left(\frac{2k_d \ce{[L] [D]}}{[\ce D] + [\ce L]}\right)\Phi.
&lt;/math&gt;
Linear stability analysis of this equation shows that the racemic state &lt;math&gt;\Phi = 0&lt;/math&gt; is unstable. Starting from [[almost everywhere]] in the concentration space, the system evolves to a homochiral state.

It is generally understood that autocatalysis alone does not yield to homochirality, and the presence of the mutually antagonistic relationship between the two enantiomers is necessary for the instability of the racemic mixture. However, recent studies show that homochirality could be achieved from autocatalysis in the absence of the mutually antagonistic relationship, but the underlying mechanism for symmetry-breaking is different.&lt;ref name="jafarpour2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2017 |title=Noise-induced symmetry breaking far from equilibrium and the emergence of biological homochirality |journal=Physical Review E |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=032407 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.95.032407|pmid=28415353 |bibcode=2017PhRvE..95c2407J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jafarpour2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2015 |title=Noise-induced mechanism for biological homochirality of early life self-replicators |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=115 |issue=15 |pages=158101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.158101|pmid=26550754 |arxiv=1507.00044 |bibcode=2015PhRvL.115o8101J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Experiments====
There are several laboratory experiments that demonstrate how a small amount of one enantiomer at the start of a reaction can lead to a large excess of a single enantiomer as the product. For example, the Soai reaction is [[autocatalysis|autocatalytic]]. If the reaction is started with some of one of the product enantiomers already present, the product acts as an [[Enantioselective synthesis|enantioselective]] catalyst for production of more of that same enantiomer.&lt;ref name=shibata&gt;{{cite journal|title=Highly Enantioselective Catalytic Asymmetric Automultiplication of Chiral Pyrimidyl Alcohol|author1=Takanori Shibata |author2=Hiroshi Morioka |author3=Tadakatsu Hayase |author4=Kaori Choji |author5=Kenso Soai | journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | year=1996| volume= 118 | issue=2| pages=471–472 | doi=10.1021/ja953066g}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial presence of just 0.2 [[Equivalent (chemistry)|equivalent]] one enantiomer can lead to up to 93% [[enantiomeric excess]] of the product.

In this system, a small enantiomeric excess of catalyst leads to a large enantiomeric excess of product.

This finding may have consequences for the development of the [[Mars Organic Detector]] scheduled for launch in 2013 which aims to recover trace amounts of amino acids from the Mars surface exactly by a sublimation technique.

A high asymmetric amplification of the [[enantiomeric excess]] of sugars are also present in the [[amino acid]] catalyzed asymmetric formation of [[carbohydrates]]&lt;ref name=Engqvist&gt;{{cite journal| title=Plausible origins of homochirality in the amino acid catalyzed neogenesis of carbohydrates|author1=Armando Córdova |author2=Magnus Engqvist |author3=Ismail Ibrahem |author4=Jesús Casas |author5=Henrik Sundén | journal=[[Chem.

One classic study involves an experiment that takes place in the laboratory.&lt;ref name=kondepudi&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Sodium Chlorate Crystallization| author= Kondepudi, D. K., Kaufman, R. J. &amp; Singh, N.| journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 250 | pages = 975–976|year=1990|doi=10.1126/science.250.4983.975|pmid=17746924|issue=4983|bibcode = 1990Sci...250..975K }}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[sodium chlorate]] is allowed to [[crystallization|crystallize]] from water and the collected crystals examined in a [[polarimeter]], each crystal turns out to be chiral and either the [[Levorotation|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;]] form or the [[Dextrorotation|&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;]] form. In an ordinary experiment the amount of &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; crystals collected equals the amount of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; crystals (corrected for statistical effects). However, when the sodium chlorate solution is stirred during the crystallization process the crystals are either exclusively &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; or exclusively &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;. In 32 consecutive crystallization experiments 14 experiments deliver &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-crystals and 18 others &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-crystals. The explanation for this symmetry breaking is unclear but is related to [[autocatalysis]] taking place in the [[nucleation]] process.

In a related experiment, a crystal suspension of a racemic [[amino acid]] derivative continuously stirred, results in a 100% crystal phase of one of the enantiomers because the enantiomeric pair is able to equilibrate in solution  (compare with [[dynamic kinetic resolution]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noorduin|first1=Wim L.|last2=Izumi|first2=Toshiko|last3=Millemaggi|first3=Alessia|last4=Leeman|first4=Michel|last5=Meekes|first5=Hugo|last6=Van Enckevort|first6=Willem J.

===Transmission===
Many strategies in [[asymmetric synthesis]] are built on chiral transmission. Especially important is the so-called [[organocatalysis]] of organic reactions by proline for example in [[Mannich reaction]]s.

==Optical resolution in racemic amino acids==
There exists no theory elucidating correlations among &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids. If one takes, for example, [[alanine]], which has a small [[methyl]] group, and [[phenylalanine]], which has a larger [[benzyl]] group, a simple question is in what aspect, &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-alanine resembles &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine more than &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine, and what kind of mechanism causes the selection of all &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids. Because it might be possible that alanine was &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and phenylalanine was &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;.

The [[enantiomeric excess]] {{math|ee {{=}} 100 &amp;times;(&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;)/(&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;+&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;)}} of these amino acids was correlated almost linearly with that of the inducer, i.e., Asn. When recrystallizations from a mixture of 12 &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids (Ala, Asp, Arg, Glu, Gln, His, Leu, Met, Ser, Val, Phe, and Tyr) and excess &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-Asn were made, all amino acids with the same configuration with Asn were preferentially co-crystallized.&lt;ref name=kojo/&gt; It was incidental whether the enrichment took place in &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;- or &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-Asn, however, once the selection was made, the co-existing amino acid with the same configuration at the α-carbon was preferentially involved because of thermodynamic stability in the crystal formation. The maximal ee was reported to be 100%. Based on these results, it is proposed that a mixture of racemic amino acids causes spontaneous and effective optical resolution, even if asymmetric synthesis of a single amino acid does not occur without an aid of an optically active molecule.

This is the first study elucidating reasonably the formation of chirality from racemic amino acids with experimental evidences.

==History of term==
This term was introduced by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]] in 1904, the year that he published his Baltimore Lecture of 1884. Kelvin used the term homochirality as a relationship between two molecules, i.e. two molecule are homochiral if they have the same chirality.&lt;ref name=Engqvist/&gt;&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=David G.|title=Stereochemistry|date=2001|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-84755-194-8|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, however, homochiral has been used in the same sense as [[enantiomer]]ically pure. This is permitted in some journals (but not encouraged),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anslyn|first1=Eric V.|last2=Dougherty|first2=Dennis A.|title=Modern physical organic chemistry|date=2006|publisher=University Science Books|location=Sausalito, Calif.|isbn=9781891389313}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|342}}&lt;ref&gt;However, the message can be confusing. In {{cite journal|last1=Moss|first1=G. P.|title=Basic terminology of stereochemistry (IUPAC Recommendations 1996)|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|date=1 January 1996|volume=68|issue=12|pages=2193–2222|doi=10.1351/pac199668122193|url=https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/pac.1996.68.issue-12/pac199668122193/pac199668122193.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2018}}, the entry for ''Enantiomerically Pure/Enantiopure'' says "Use of homochiral as a synonym is strongly discouraged"; but the entry for ''Homochiral'' says "See ''enantiomerically pure/enantiopure''."&lt;/ref&gt; its meaning changing into the preference of a process or system for a single [[optical isomer]] in a pair of isomers in these journals.

'''Human ecosystems''' are [[complex system|complex cybernetic systems]] that are increasingly being used by [[ecological]] [[anthropologists]] and other scholars to examine the ecological aspects of human communities in a way that integrates multiple factors as economics, socio-political organization, psychological factors, and physical factors related to the environment.

'''Hyperhydricity''' (previously known as vitrification) is a [[Physiology|physiological]] [[malformation]] that results in excessive [[Tissue hydration|hydration]], low [[lignification]], impaired stomatal function and reduced [[mechanical strength]] of tissue culture-generated plants. The consequence is poor regeneration of such plants without intensive [[greenhouse]] acclimation for outdoor growth.&lt;ref&gt;Kei-ichiro U, Susan C and Kalidas S (1998). Reduced hyperhydricity and enhanced growth of tissue culture-generated raspberry (Rubus sp.) clonal lines by Pseudomonas sp. isolated from oregano. Process Biochemistry 33(4): 441-445.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, it may also lead to leaf-tip and bud [[necrosis]] in some cases, which often leads to loss of [[apical dominance]] in the shoots.&lt;ref&gt;Cassells A and Curry R (2001). Oxidative stress and physiological, epigenetic and genetic variability in plant tissue culture: implications for micropropagators and genetic engineers. Plant Cell Tissue And Organ Culture. 64(2-3):145-157&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the main symptom of hyperhydricity is translucent characteristics signified by a shortage of [[chlorophyll]] and high water content. Specifically, the presence of a thin or absent [[cuticular]] layer, reduced number of [[palisade cells]], irregular [[stomata]], less developed [[cell wall]] and large intracellular spaces in the [[mesophyll cell]] layer have been described as some of the anatomic changes associated with hyperhydricity.&lt;ref&gt;Franck T, Kevers C, Gaspar T, Dommes J, Deby C, Greimers R, Serteyn D and Deby-Dupont G (2004). Hyperhydricity of Prunus avium shoots cultured on gelrite: a controlled stress response. Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, 42: 519-527&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
The main causes of hyperhydricity in plant [[tissue culture]] are those factors triggering [[oxidative stress]]es such as high salt concentration, high [[relative humidity]], low [[irradiance|light intensity]], gas accumulation in the atmosphere of the jar, length of time intervals between [[subculture]]s; number of subcultures, concentration and type of [[gelling agent]], the type of explants used, the concentrations of microelement and hormonal imbalances.&lt;ref&gt;2&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperhydricity is commonly apparent in [[liquid culture]]-grown plants or when there is low concentration of gelling agent. High [[ammonium]] concentration also contributes to hyperhydricity.&lt;ref&gt;Franck T, Kevers C, Gaspar T, Dommes J, Deby C, Greimers R, Serteyn D and Deby-Dupont G (2004). Hyperhydricity of Prunus avium shoots cultured on gelrite: a controlled stress response. Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, 42: 519-527&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control==

Hyperhydricity can be monitored by modifying the atmosphere of the culture vessels. Adjusting the relative humidity in the vessel is one of the most important parameters to be controlled. Use of gas-permeable membranes may help in this regard as this allows increased exchange of [[water vapor]] and other gases such as ethylene with the surrounding environment. Using higher concentration of a gelling agent, on top of the use of a higher-strength gelling agent may reduce the risk from hyperhydricity. Hyperhydricity can also be controlled by bottom cooling, which allows water to condense on the medium,&lt;ref&gt;Pérez-Tornero O, Egea J, Olmos E and Burgos L (2001). Control of Hyperhydricity in Micropropagated Apricot Cultivars. In Vitro Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology. Plant. 37(2): 250-254&lt;/ref&gt; the use of cytokinin-meta-topolin (6-(3-Hydroxybenzylamino)purine)&lt;/9&gt;, the combination of lower [[cytokinin]] and [[ammonium nitrate]] in the medium, use of [[nitrate]] or [[glutamine]] as the sole [[nitrogen]] source  and decreasing the ratio of NH4+:NO3- in the medium.&lt;ref&gt;Bairu M, Stirk W, Dolezal K, Van Staden J (2007). Optimizing the micropropagation protocol for the endangered Aloe polyphylla: can meta-topolin and its derivatives serve as replacement for benzyladenine and zeatin? Plant Cell Tissue Organ Cult 90:15–23&lt;/ref&gt;
In studies on calcium deficiency in tissue cultures of ''Lavandula angustifolia'', it was shown that an increase in calcium in the medium reduced hyperhydricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Machado, M.P.|first1=A.L.L.

'''ISO 690''' is an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] [[standardization|standard]] for [[Citation|bibliographic referencing]] in different kind of [[documents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bob |last=Stayton |date=September 2007 |chapter=Customizing bibliography output |chapterurl=http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/CustomBiblio.html |title=DocBook XSL: The Complete Guide |edition=4th |isbn=978-0-9741521-3-4 |publisher=Sagehill Enterprises |location=[[Santa Cruz, California]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:690:ed-3:v1:en|title=ISO 690:2010(en). Online Browsing Platform (OBP).|last=|first=|date=|website=www.iso.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes [[electronic documents]], and specifies the elements to be included in references to published documents, and the order in which the elements of the reference should be stated. Punctuation and style (output mask) are not part of the standard; it is a standard [[separation of presentation and content|for content more than for presentation]]. Thus, it influences a user's [[XML]] and [[XSL]], although not necessarily the [[CSS]].

ISO 690 covers references to published material in both print and non-print form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:690:ed-3:v1:en|title=International Standard.

Even though ISO 690:2010(E) generally suggests to place the date of publication after ''place'' and ''publisher'' (referred to as "production information"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Standard. ISO 690. Reference number ISO 690:2010(E). Information and documentation - Guidelines for bibliographic references and citations to information resources|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|editor-last=ISO 2010|edition=3|location=Geneva (Switzerland)|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;) it also hints to the [[Parenthetical referencing|Harvard system]] style (name-date system) and provides also various examples of its way of citation in the annex of ISO 690:2010(E).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Standard.

==Parts of the document==
Until 2010, ISO 690 appeared in two ISO documents:
* ISO 690:1987 (''Information and documentation - Bibliographic references - Content, form and structure'');
* ISO 690-2:1997 (''Information and documentation - Bibliographic references - Part 2: Electronic documents or parts thereof'')

==Examples of citation (ISO 690:1987)==

Actual status of standard is ISO 690:2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=43320  Information and documentation -- Guidelines for bibliographic references and citations to information resources]&lt;/ref&gt; The material is copyrighted and not free for distribution. Basically, the application of older version of ISO standard is not a fault.

The '''International Association for Accounting Education &amp; Research''' (IAAER) is a non-profit organization that promotes excellence in accounting education and [[accounting research|research]]. The organization also seeks to ensure that accounting academics make the maximum contribution to development of excellent accounting standards.&lt;ref name=IAAERabout/&gt;

==Foundation==

The origins of the IAAER can be traced back to meetings of the International Congresses on Accounting that started in 1904. The [[International Federation of Accountants]] began holding separate International Conferences on Accounting Education in 1962. IAAER was founded in 1984 to serve as a co-host with the Japanese Accounting Association for the sixth of these conferences, which was scheduled to be held in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]] in 1987. 
Its organization was defined at a meeting in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]] on 17 August 1984, with representatives from Australia, Canada, Japan, Netherlands, Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==

IAAER offers institutional, university, individual, and student memberships.  
As of 2009, IAAER had about 50 institutional members, including professional accounting bodies such as the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] and accounting academic organizations such as the [[American Accounting Association]].
In 2009, IAAER announced that all members would have access to eIFRS, an online repository of material about [[International Financial Reporting Standards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=IAAER Announces Free eIFRS Access for Academic Members 
 |publisher=Deloitte Global Services Limited
 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

IAAER contributes to international accounting and auditing standards through relationships with various international bodies, bringing a research-based academic viewpoint. Specifically, IAAER is represented on the [[International Accounting Education Standards Board]] (IAESB) of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC), the Education Advisory Group of the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation and the Standards Advisory Council of the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB).&lt;ref name=IAAERabout/&gt;
 
IAAER commissions research projects to develop improvements to international accounting and educational standards, and promotes development of accounting skills by working with local and regional bodies and organizing conferences and workshops.&lt;ref name=IAAERabout/&gt;
For example, in 2006 IAAER and [[KPMG]] invited research proposals under the Defining, Recognizing and Measuring Liabilities Research Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |publisher=Canadian Academic Accounting Association
 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 2007, IAAER and the [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA) announced that they were providing up to five research grants of up to $25,000, funded by ACCA, to support the work of the IAESB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=ACCA AND IAAER LAUNCH INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION RESEARCH CALL
 |date=7 Nov 2007
 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2010 IAAER and ACCA again issued a call for proposals for research supporting development of international standards of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |date=2 July 2010
 |title=ACCA and IAAER call for research proposals
 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IAAER sponsors and coordinates the World Congress of Accounting Educators and Researchers, which is held every four years in conjunction with IFAC World Congress. IAAER issues the COSMOS Accountancy Chronicle, a newsletter, supports the ''[[Journal of International Financial Management and Accounting]]'' and ''Accounting and Accounting Education: An International Journal'', the official journals of the organization.&lt;ref name=IAAERabout/&gt;

'''Lesbian sexual practices''' are [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] involving [[women who have sex with women]], regardless of their [[sexual orientation]]. A woman who has sex with another woman may identify as a [[lesbian]] if she is exclusively sexually attracted to women, or [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] if she is not exclusively sexually attracted to women, or dispense with [[sexual identification]] altogether. The term may also be applied to a [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or [[asexuality|asexual]] woman who is unsure of or is exploring her sexuality.

[[Romance (love)|Romantic]] or sexual [[interpersonal relationship]]s are often subject to [[sexual desire]] and [[sexual arousal|arousal]], which then leads to sexual activity for sexual release. A physical expression of intimacy between women depends on the context of the relationship along with social, cultural and other influences.&lt;ref name="Hite reports"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hite Reports: What do they say?|publisher=hite-research.com|date= |accessdate=November 19, 2011|url=http://www.hite-research.com/thehitereports.htm|archivedate=June 1, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601230726/http://www.hite-research.com/thehitereports.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behaviors==

===General===
[[File:Oral nipple stimulation.png|thumb|A woman [[stimulation of nipples|orally stimulating the nipples]] of her sexual partner]]
Commonly, women engage in displays of affection, such as kissing on the cheek or hugging. A kiss on the lips, a prolonged kiss or hug, or other forms of touching, may or may not be regarded as [[Human sexuality|sexual]]. [[Sex educator]] and [[feminist]] [[Shere Hite]] stated that one of her female research subjects had written, "Sex with a woman includes: touching, kissing, smiling, looking serious, embracing, talking, digital intercourse, caressing, looking, cunnilingus, undressing, remembering later, making sounds, sometimes gently biting, sometimes crying, and breathing and sighing together."&lt;ref name="Hite/lesbianism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesbianism: Women's Sexual Expression Together|publisher=hite-research.com|date=|accessdate=February 3, 2012|url=http://www.hite-research.com/artlesbianism.html|archivedate=October 17, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017143602/http://www.hite-research.com/artlesbianism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disrobing before a partner, removing the clothing of a partner or performing acts of [[physical intimacy]], such as the touching of a partner's [[erogenous zone]]s by the use of hands, tongue or rest of the mouth, may be regarded as indicators of the partner's desire for sexual activity and an [[erotic stimuli]] or turn-on (sexual arousal), which may generate erotic sensations in both partners. Allowing such acts of physical intimacy, especially the stimulation of a partner's breasts and nipples, is an indication of  reciprocal interest in sexual activity.

A woman's mouth, lips and tongue may be sensitive erogenous zones; they are commonly used by partners during the preliminary stages and throughout a sexual activity, whether for kissing, sucking, licking or specifically for [[oral sex]]. The stimulation of a partner's breasts, including [[Stimulation of nipples|oral or manual stimulation of the nipples]], is a form of [[foreplay]]. Breast and nipple stimulation of women is a common aspect of sexual activity.&lt;ref name=levin&gt;Levin, Roy J.

Vol.21, Issue 2 (May 2006). p.237–249&lt;/ref&gt; The stimulation of a woman's nipples promotes the production and release of [[oxytocin]] and [[prolactin]].&lt;ref name="Levin"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Levin R, Meston C |title=Nipple/Breast stimulation and sexual arousal in young men and women |journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=450–4 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16681470 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2006.00230.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the stimulation of the nipples, large amounts of oxytocin are released, which would normally prepare the breast for breastfeeding. Besides creating maternal feelings in a woman, it also decreases her [[anxiety]] and increases bonding and trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/716623_4| title=Physiologic Mechanism of Nipple Stimulation |publisher=Medscape Today from WebMD |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19482229"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Lee HJ, Macbeth AH, Pagani JH, Young WS |title=Oxytocin: the Great Facilitator of Life |journal=Progress in Neurobiology |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=127–51 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19482229 |doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2009.04.001 |pmc=2689929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[orgasm]] includes involuntary actions, including muscular [[spasm]]s in multiple areas of the body, a general [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoric]] sensation and, frequently, body movements and [[Manner of articulation|vocalization]]s.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Martha |last= Rosenthal| title = Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society| publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year= 2012|pages=133–135| isbn = 0618755713|accessdate=May 12, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&amp;pg=PT153&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XiqoUOWGDcfcqQHFpIDIAw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period after orgasm, known as a [[refractory period (sex)|refractory period]], is often a relaxing experience, attributed to the release of the [[neurohormone]]s oxytocin and prolactin.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schacter"&gt;{{cite book| title =Psychology| publisher =[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|year= 2010|page=336|accessdate =May 12, 2014| isbn = 1429237198|url = https://books.google.com/?id=emAyzTNy1cUC&amp;pg=PA336&amp;dq=Women+do+experience+a+refractory+period#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author1=Daniel L. Schacter |author2=Daniel T. Gilbert |author3=Daniel M.

Oral stimulation of the [[clitoris]] or other parts of [[vulva]] or the [[vagina]] is commonly practiced between women and, like oral stimulation of the nipples, can include the use of teeth in addition to use of the lips or tongue.&lt;ref name="Carroll2"&gt;{{cite book|title =Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity|isbn = 0-495-60274-4|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2009|page=272|accessdate=2010-12-19|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5f8mQx7ULs4C&amp;pg=PA272&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | author =Janell L.

===Dominance, submission and BDSM===

On occasion, for variety, or on a more regular or routine basis, a woman may assume a passive role during sexual activity and leave it to her partner to provide their sexual satisfaction, which can also be an aspect of [[dominance and submission]]. For example, a person in a doggy style position may be passive and open to a variety of sex acts, generally at the choice of the active partner, such as fingering from behind, massage or stimulation of erogenous zones, including the genitals, nipples, or buttocks, and receiving a [[erotic spanking|playful spank]] to the buttocks.&lt;ref name= Rogiere&gt;Rogiere, Jean, "The Little Book of Sex". Ulysses Press. 2001. {{ISBN|1-56975-305-9}}, 96 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; The active partner can also introduce a sex toy, such as a dildo or [[vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]], into the vagina or anus.

To ensure passivity and to enhance the feeling of or actual [[female submission]], a partner may also take part in [[sexual bondage|bondage]] (such as handcuffs) or in other [[BDSM]] activities.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimmel"/&gt; During sexual bondage, the restrained partner is generally open to a variety of sex acts and cannot interfere in the ensuing sexual activity. She is dependent for her sexual satisfaction on the actions of her partner, who can choose the type and pace of the sexual activity and can introduce sex toys. For example, a [[pecker gag]] can be used to [[gag (BDSM)|gag]] the restrained partner as well as to require her to suck during sexual activity in a similar manner to an [[adult pacifier]]. The active partner has the role of treating the restrained partner as a [[sex object]] to be used for her own sexual satisfaction. The active partner may herself derive sexual satisfaction from providing her sex partner with sexual satisfaction and bringing her to orgasm.

==Research and views==
[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (27).jpg|thumb|Late 19th-century painting by [[Édouard-Henri Avril]] showing the use of a strap-on dildo]]
In 1953, [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]'' documented that, over the previous five years of sexual activity, 78% of women had orgasms in 60% to 100% of sexual encounters with other women, compared with 55% for heterosexual sex.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey, A.]]; [[Wardell Pomeroy|Pomeroy, W.]]; [[Clyde Martin|Martin, C.]], &amp; [[Paul Gebhard|Gebhard, P.]] ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'', Philadelphia: Saunders (1953), {{ISBN|978-0-253-33411-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsey attributed this difference to female partners knowing more about women's sexuality and how to optimize women's sexual satisfaction than male partners do.&lt;ref name="Weiten"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology Applied to Modern Life: Adjustment in the 21st Century|isbn =1-111-18663-4|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2011|page=386|accessdate=January 5, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CGu96TeAZo0C&amp;pg=PT423|author1=Wayne Weiten |author2=Dana S. Dunn |author3=Elizabeth Yost Hammer }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, studies by several scholars, including [[Masters and Johnson]], concluded that lesbian sexual behaviors more often have qualities associated with sexual satisfaction than their heterosexual counterparts, or that female partners are more likely to emphasize the emotional aspects of lovemaking.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iasenza"&gt;Iasenza, S. [http://www.fridae.com/newsfeatures/2001/11/09/1173.the-big-lie-lesbian-bed-death ''The Big Lie: Lesbian Bed Death''], [[Fridae]] newsletter (November 9, 2001). Retrieved on June 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Masters and Johnson's 1979 study on lesbian sexual practices concluded that lesbian sexual encounters include more full-body sexual contact, rather than genital-focused contact, less preoccupation or anxiety about achieving orgasm, more sexual assertiveness and communication about sexual needs, [[Human sexual response cycle|longer lasting sexual encounters]] and greater satisfaction with the overall quality of one's sexual life.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iasenza"/&gt;

Studies by [[Pepper Schwartz]] and Philip Blumstein (1983) and Diane Holmberg and Karen L. Blair (2009) contradict research indicating that women in same-sex relationships are more sexually satisfied than their heterosexual counterparts. Schwartz concluded that lesbian couples in committed relationships have less sex than any other type of couple, and that they generally experience less sexual intimacy the longer the relationship lasts, though this study has been subject to debate (see [[Lesbian bed death]]).&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iasenza"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCroy"&gt;{{cite web|first=Winnie|last=McCroy|title=The Myth of Lesbian Bed Death|date=June 22, 2010|accessdate=February 20, 2011|publisher=''[[The Village Voice]]''|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-06-22/news/myth-of-lesbian-bed-death/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dowling"&gt;{{cite web|first=Nikki|last=Dowling|title=Girl On Girl: Lesbian Bed Death Is A Big, Fat Myth |date=February 25, 2010|accessdate=February 20, 2011|publisher=''[[The Frisky (website)|The Frisky]]''|url=http://www.thefrisky.com/post/246-girl-on-girl-i-think-lesbian-bed-death-is-a-big-fat-myth/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmberg and Blair's study, on the other hand, published in ''[[Journal of Sex Research|The Journal of Sex Research]]'', found that women in same-sex relationships enjoyed identical sexual desire, sexual communication, sexual satisfaction, and satisfaction with orgasm as their heterosexual counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv |title=Sexual Desire, Communication, Satisfaction, and Preferences of Men and Women in Same-Sex Versus Mixed-Sex Relationships |first1=Diane |last1=Holmberg |first2=Karen Lyndsay |last2=Blair |pages=57–66 |doi=10.1080/00224490802645294 |issn=1559-8519 |journal=[[Journal of Sex Research|The Journal of Sex Research]] |volume=46 |issue=1 |year=2009 |publisher=[[Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality]] |format=PDF |url=http://www.klbresearch.com/KLB_Research/Research_files/Holmberg%20&amp;%20Blair%20JSR%20Vol%2046%20Iss%201%202009.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021062010/http://www.klbresearch.com/KLB_Research/Research_files/Holmberg%20%26%20Blair%20JSR%20Vol%2046%20Iss%201%202009.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional research by Blair &amp; Pukall (2014) reported similar findings, such that women in same-sex relationships reported similar levels of overall sexual satisfaction and lower levels of sexual frequency. However, this recent study also reported that women in same-sex relationships spent significantly longer amounts of time on individual sexual encounters - often spending upwards of two hours on an individual encounter. Consequently, what lesbians may lack in frequency, they may make up for with longer durations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv|title=Can Less Be More?

With regard to the ease or difficulty of achieving orgasm, Hite's research (while subject to methodological limitations) showed that most women need clitoral (exterior) stimulation for orgasm, which can be "easy and strong, given the right stimulation" and that the need for clitoral stimulation in addition to knowing one's own body is the reason that most women reach orgasm more easily by masturbation.&lt;ref name="Hite reports"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Hite Report"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hite|first=Shere|authorlink=Shere Hite|title=The Hite Report: A Nationwide Study of Female Sexuality |publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]]|year=2004|location=New York, NY|pages=512 pages|isbn=1-58322-569-2|accessdate=March 2, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s3OZaVn2wfkC&amp;lpg=PP1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Replicating Kinsey's findings, studies by scholars such as Peplau, Fingerhut and Beals (2004) and Diamond (2006) indicate that lesbians have orgasms more often and more easily in sexual interactions than heterosexual women do.&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt;

Preferences for specific sexual practices among female same-sex relationships have also been studied. Masters and Johnson concluded that vaginal penetration with dildos is rare and lesbians tend to do more overall genital stimulation than direct clitoral stimulation, which is also often the case for heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt; Concerning oral sex, the common belief that all women who have sex with women engage in cunnilingus contrasts research on the subject. Some lesbian or bisexual women dislike oral sex because they do not like the experience or due to psychological or social factors, such as finding it unclean.&lt;ref name="Belge2"&gt;{{cite web|first=Kathy|last=Belge|title=Do All Lesbians Like Oral Sex?|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=|accessdate=June 3, 2012|url=http://lesbianlife.about.com/od/lesbiansex/f/DoAllLesbiansLikeOral.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCormick"&gt;{{cite book|author=Naomi B.

Lesbians in their 30s were twice as likely as other age groups to engage in anal stimulation (with a finger or dildo).&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt; A 2014 study of partnered lesbian women in Canada and the U.S. found that 7% engaged in anal stimulation or penetration at least once a week; about 10% did so monthly and 70% did not at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Jacqueline N.|last2=Byers|first2=E.

In 2003, Julia V Bailey and her research team published data based on a sample from the [[United Kingdom]] of 803 lesbian and bisexual women attending two London lesbian sexual health clinics and 415 women who have sex with women (WSW) from a community sample; the study reported that the most commonly cited sexual practices between women "were oral sex, digital vaginal penetration, mutual masturbation, and tribadism (frottage with genital-to-genital contact or rubbing of the genitals against another part of the partner's body), each of which occurred in 85% of [women who have sex with women]". Like older studies, the data also showed that vaginal penetration with dildos, or with other sex toys, among women who have sex with women is rare.&lt;ref name="Zenilman &amp; Shahmanesh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexual behaviour of lesbians and bisexual women|author1=J V Bailey |author2=C Farquhar |author3=C Owen |author4=D Whittaker |journal=[[Sexually Transmitted Infections (journal)|Sexually Transmitted Infections]]|volume=79|issue=2|date=April 2003|pmid=12690139|doi=10.1136/sti.79.2.147|pages=147–150|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1744617/pdf/v079p00147.pdf|pmc=1744617}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 online survey of 3,116 women who have sex with women, published in ''[[The BMJ]]'', found the majority of women reporting a history of genital rubbing (99.8%), vaginal fingering (99.2%), genital scissoring (90.8%), cunnilingus (98.8%) and vibrator use (74.1%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=22563015 | doi=10.1136/sextrans-2011-050404 | volume=88 | title=Sexual behaviour and risk reduction strategies among a multinational sample of women who have sex with women | year=2012 | journal=Sex Transm Infect | pages=407–12 | last1 = Schick | first1 = V | last2 = Rosenberger | first2 = JG | last3 = Herbenick | first3 = D | last4 = Reece | first4 = M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health risks==

Like most sexual activity, lesbian sexual activities can carry risks of [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs), such as [[Herpes genitalis|genital herpes]] or other [[pathogen]]ic infections. When lesbian sexual activity is of a non-penetrative nature, the risk of exchange of [[bodily fluid]]s is generally lower and therefore the incidence of transmission of sexually transmitted infections is also relatively low,&lt;ref name="Hales"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dianne Hales|title=An Invitation to Health Brief 2010-2011| publisher = [[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2008|accessdate=August 29, 2013|pages =269–271| isbn =0495391921|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oP91HVIMPRIC&amp;pg=PA269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Alexander|author2= Helaine Bader|author3= Judith H.

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) did not recognize female-to-female transmission as a possible method of HIV infection until 1995. The CDC reported there is little data available regarding the risk of spreading sexually transmitted infections between women.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; However, the CDC states that pathogens such as metronidazole-resistant [[trichomoniasis]], genotype-concordant HIV, [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV, which has been linked to nearly all cases of [[cervical cancer]]) and [[syphilis]] can be spread through sexual contact between women.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; While the rates of these pathologies are unknown, one study showed 30% of lesbians and bisexual women had medical histories with sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee R |title=Health care problems of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender patients |journal=West.

Health Canada noted "the prevalence of all types of HPV (cancer and non-cancer-causing) in different groups of Canadian women ranges from 20%–33%" and an American university study found 60% of sexually active females were infected with HPV at some time within a three-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Genuis|first1=Stephen J.|last2=Genuis|first2=Shelagh K.|title=Managing the sexually transmitted disease pandemic: A time for reevaluation|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=191|issue=4|pages=1103–1112|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2004.03.019|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2004.03.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[American Family Physician]]'' suggests that lesbian and bisexual women "cover sex toys that penetrate more than one person's vagina or anus with a new condom for each person" and to "consider using different toys for each person", to use a [[Barrier contraception|protection barrier]] (for example, a latex sheet, [[dental dam]], cut-open condom or, plastic wrap) during oral sex and to "use latex or vinyl gloves and lubricant for any manual sex that might cause bleeding unprotected contact with a sexual partner's menstrual blood and with any visible genital lesions".&lt;ref name="Mravack"/&gt; However, there "is no good evidence" that using a dental dam reduces STI transmission risks between women who have sex with women; studies show that using a dental dam as a protection barrier is rarely practiced, and that, among women who have sex with women, this may be because the individuals have "limited knowledge about the possibilities of STI transmission or [feel] less vulnerable to STIs [such as HIV]".&lt;ref name=" Zenilman &amp; Shahmanesh"/&gt;

== Stevens's typology ==
=== Overview ===
Stevens proposed his typology in a 1946 ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' article titled "On the theory of scales of measurement".&lt;ref name="Stevens 1946"/&gt; In that article, Stevens claimed that all [[measurement]] in science was conducted using four different types of scales that he called "nominal," "ordinal," "interval," and "ratio," unifying both "[[Qualitative property|qualitative]]" (which are described by his "nominal" type) and "[[Quantitative property|quantitative]]" (to a different degree, all the rest of his scales). The concept of scale types later received the mathematical rigour that it lacked at its inception with the work of mathematical psychologists Theodore Alper (1985, 1987), Louis Narens (1981a, b), and [[R. Duncan Luce]] (1986, 1987, 2001). As Luce (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;395) wrote:
{{quote|S. S. Stevens (1946, 1951, 1975) claimed that what counted was having an interval or ratio scale. Subsequent research has given meaning to this assertion, but given his attempts to invoke scale type ideas it is doubtful if he understood it himself&amp;nbsp;... no measurement theorist I know accepts Stevens's broad definition of measurement&amp;nbsp;... in our view, the only sensible meaning for 'rule' is empirically testable laws about the attribute.}}

=== Nominal level ===
The nominal type differentiates between items or subjects based only on their names or (meta-)categories and other qualitative classifications they belong to; thus dichotomous data involves the [[Constructivist epistemology|construction of classifications]] as well as the classification of items. Discovery of an exception to a classification can be viewed as progress. Numbers may be used to represent the variables but the numbers do not have numerical value or relationship:  for example, a [[globally unique identifier]].

Examples of these classifications include gender, nationality, ethnicity, language, genre, style, biological species, and form.&lt;ref&gt;Nominal measures are based on sets and  depend on categories, a la Aristotle: {{cite web |url=http://www4.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/gmartin/geog476/Lecture/BeySt.htm |title=Beyond Stevens: A revised approach to measurement for geographic information |first=Nicholas |last=Chrisman |date=March 1995 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Invariably one came up against fundamental physical limits to the accuracy of measurement. ... The art of physical measurement seemed to be a matter of compromise, of choosing between reciprocally related uncertainties. ...  Multiplying together the conjugate pairs of uncertainty limits mentioned, however, I found that they formed invariant products of not one but two distinct kinds. ... The first group of limits were calculable ''a priori'' from a specification of the instrument. The second group could be calculated only ''a posteriori'' from a specification of what was ''done'' with the instrument. ... In the first case each unit [of information] would add one additional ''dimension'' (conceptual category), whereas in the second each unit would add one additional ''atomic fact''.", – pp. 1–4: MacKay, Donald M. (1969), ''Information, Mechanism, and Meaning'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-63-032-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a university one could also use hall of affiliation as an example. Other concrete examples are 
* in [[grammar]], the [[parts of speech]]: noun, verb, preposition, article, pronoun, etc.
* in politics, [[power projection]]: hard power, soft power, etc.
* in biology, the [[taxonomic rank]]s below domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya
* in [[software engineering]], type of [[Trap (computing)|faults]]: specification faults, design faults, and code faults

Nominal scales were often called qualitative scales, and measurements made on qualitative scales were called qualitative data. However, the rise of qualitative research has made this usage confusing. The numbers in nominal measurement are assigned as labels and have no specific numerical value or meaning. No form of arithmetic computation (+,&amp;nbsp;−,&amp;nbsp;×,&amp;nbsp;etc.) may be performed on nominal measures. The nominal level is the lowest measurement level  used from a statistical point of view.

====Mathematical operations====
[[Equality (mathematics)|Equality]] and other operations that can be defined in terms of equality, such as [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] and [[set membership]], are the only [[non-trivial]] [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s that generically apply to objects of the nominal type.

====Central tendency====
The [[mode (statistics)|mode]], i.e. the ''most common'' item, is allowed as the measure of [[central tendency]] for the nominal type. On the other hand, the [[median]], i.e. the ''middle-ranked'' item, makes no sense for the nominal type of data since ranking is meaningless for the nominal type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manikandan|first1=S.|title=Measures of central tendency: Median and mode|journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapeutics|date=2011|volume=2|issue=3|pages=214–5|doi=10.4103/0976-500X.83300|pmc=3157145|pmid=21897729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordinal scale===
{{anchor |Ordinal scale}}&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[IQ classification]] and other articles --&gt;
{{further|Ordinal data}}

The ordinal type allows for [[rank order]] (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) by which data can be sorted, but still does not allow for relative ''degree of difference'' between them. Examples include, on one hand, '''dichotomous''' data with dichotomous (or dichotomized) values such as 'sick' vs. 'healthy' when measuring health, 'guilty' vs. 'not-guilty' when making judgments in courts, 'wrong/false' vs. 'right/true' when measuring [[truth value]], and, on the other hand, '''non-dichotomous''' data consisting of a spectrum of values, such as 'completely agree', 'mostly agree', 'mostly disagree', 'completely disagree' when measuring [[opinion]].

; Central tendency
The [[median]], i.e. ''middle-ranked'', item is allowed as the measure of [[central tendency]]; however, the mean (or average) as the measure of [[central tendency]] is not allowed. The [[mode (statistics)|mode]] is allowed.

In 1946, Stevens observed that psychological measurement, such as measurement of opinions, usually operates on ordinal scales; thus means and standard deviations have no [[Validity (logic)|validity]], but they can be used to get ideas for how to improve [[operationalization]] of variables used in [[questionnaire]]s. Most psychological data collected by [[psychometric]] instruments and tests, measuring [[cognitive]] and other abilities, are ordinal, although some theoreticians have argued they can be treated as interval or ratio scales. However, there is little [[prima facie]] evidence to suggest that such attributes are anything more than ordinal (Cliff, 1996; Cliff &amp; Keats, 2003; Michell, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite book |title=Statistical Theories of Mental Test Scores |last1=Lord |first1=Frederic M. |last2=Novick |first2=Melvin R. |last3=Birnbaum |first3=Allan |year=1968 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Reading (MA) |lccn=68011394 |laysummary=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1162101 |laydate=24 June 2013 |page=21 |quote=Although, formally speaking, interval measurement can always be obtained by specification, such specification is theoretically meaningful only if it is implied by the theory and model relevant to the measurement procedure. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Parametric and Nonparametric Statistical Procedures |last=Sheskin |first=David J. |year=2007 |edition=Fourth |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |location=Boca Raton (FL) |isbn=978-1-58488-814-7 |page=3 |laysummary=http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781584888147 |laydate=27 July 2010 |quote=Although in practice IQ and most other human characteristics measured by psychological tests (such as anxiety, introversion, self esteem, etc.) are treated as interval scales, many researchers would argue that they are more appropriately categorized as ordinal scales.

===Interval scale===
The interval type allows for the ''degree of difference'' between items, but not the ratio between them. Examples include ''temperature'' with the [[degree Celsius|Celsius scale]], which has two defined points (the freezing and boiling point of water at specific conditions) and then separated into 100 intervals, ''date'' when measured from an arbitrary epoch (such as AD), ''percentage'' such as a percentage return on a [[stock]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Black | first = Ken | chapter = Introduction | title = Business Statistics: Contemporary Decision Making | publisher = Wiley | edition = 6th | date = 2010 | location = Hoboken, NJ | pages = 2–135 | isbn = 0-470-40901-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''location'' in Cartesian coordinates, and ''direction'' measured in degrees from true or magnetic north. Ratios are not meaningful since 20&amp;nbsp;°C cannot be said to be "twice as hot" as 10&amp;nbsp;°C, nor can multiplication/division be carried out between any two dates directly. However, ''ratios of differences'' can be expressed; for example, one difference can be twice another. Interval type variables are sometimes also called "scaled variables", but the formal mathematical term is an [[affine space]] (in this case an [[affine line]]).

====Central tendency and statistical dispersion====
The [[mode (statistics)|mode]], [[median]], and [[arithmetic mean]] are allowed to measure central tendency of interval variables, while measures of statistical dispersion include [[range (statistics)|range]] and [[standard deviation]]. Since one can only divide by ''differences'', one cannot define measures that require some ratios, such as &lt;!--- the studentized range or. --- Error: studentized range is a ratio of a difference (range) to a root-mean-square difference (standard DEVIATION from the mean ---&gt; the [[coefficient of variation]]. More subtly, while one can define [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]] about the origin, only central moments are meaningful, since the choice of origin is arbitrary. One can define [[Standardized_moment|standardized moments]], since ratios of differences are meaningful, but one cannot define the coefficient of variation, since the mean is a moment about the origin, unlike the standard deviation, which is (the square root of) a central moment.

=== Ratio scale ===
The ratio type takes its name from the fact that measurement is the estimation of the ratio between a magnitude of a continuous quantity and a unit magnitude of the same kind (Michell, 1997, 1999). A ratio scale possesses a meaningful (unique and non-arbitrary) zero value.  Most measurement in the physical sciences and engineering is done on ratio scales. Examples include [[mass]], [[length]], [[Time|duration]], [[plane angle]], [[energy]] and [[electric charge]]. In contrast to interval scales, ratios are now meaningful because having a non-arbitrary zero point makes it meaningful to say, for example, that one object has "twice the length."  Very informally, many ratio scales can be described as specifying "how much" of something (i.e. an amount or magnitude) or "how many" (a count). The [[Kelvin]] temperature scale is a ratio scale because it has a unique, non-arbitrary zero point called [[absolute zero]].  &lt;!-- The zero point of the Celsius scale is at 273.15 kelvins, so Celsius is not a ratio scale. --&gt;

; Central tendency and statistical dispersion
The [[geometric mean]] and the [[harmonic mean]] are allowed to measure the central tendency, in addition to the mode, median, and arithmetic mean. The [[studentized range]] and the [[coefficient of variation]] are allowed to measure statistical dispersion. All statistical measures are allowed because all necessary mathematical operations are defined for the ratio scale.

== Debate on Stevens's typology ==
While Stevens's typology is widely adopted, it is still being challenged by other theoreticians, particularly in the cases of the nominal and ordinal types (Michell, 1986).&lt;ref name = "Velleman and Wilkinson 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Velleman |first1=Paul F. |last2=Wilkinson |first2=Leland |journal=The American Statistician | title=Nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio typologies are misleading |volume=47 | number=1 | year = 1993 |pages=65–72 |doi=10.2307/2684788 |publisher=American Statistical Association | jstor=2684788 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duncan (1986) objected to the use of the word ''measurement'' in relation to the nominal type, but Stevens (1975) said of his own definition of measurement that "the assignment can be any consistent rule. The only rule not allowed would be random assignment, for randomness amounts in effect to a nonrule". However, so-called nominal measurement involves arbitrary assignment, and the "permissible transformation" is any number for any other. This is one of the points made in Lord's (1953) satirical paper ''On the Statistical Treatment of Football Numbers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lord |first1= Frederic M. |journal=American Psychologist |title = On the Statistical Treatment of Football Numbers |volume=8 |number=12 |date=December 1953  | pages=750–751 |doi=10.1037/h0063675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the mean as a measure of the central tendency for the ordinal type is still debatable among those who accept Stevens's typology. Many behavioural scientists use the mean for ordinal data, anyway. This is often justified on the basis that the ordinal type in behavioural science is in fact somewhere between the true ordinal and interval types; although the interval difference between two ordinal ranks is not constant, it is often of the same order of magnitude.

For example, applications of measurement models in educational contexts often indicate that total scores have a fairly linear relationship with measurements across the range of an assessment. Thus, some argue that so long as the unknown interval difference between ordinal scale ranks is not too variable, interval scale statistics such as means can meaningfully be used on ordinal scale variables. Statistical analysis software such as [[SPSS]] requires the user to select the appropriate measurement class for each variable. This ensures that subsequent user errors cannot inadvertently perform meaningless analyses (for example correlation analysis with a variable on a nominal level).

[[L. L. Thurstone]] made progress toward developing a justification for obtaining the interval type, based on the [[law of comparative judgment]]. A common application of the law is the [[analytic hierarchy process]]. Further progress was made by [[Georg Rasch]] (1960), who developed the probabilistic [[Rasch model]] that provides a theoretical basis and justification for obtaining interval-level measurements from counts of observations such as total scores on assessments.

===Other proposed typologies===
Typologies aside from Stevens's typology has been proposed. For instance, [[Frederick Mosteller|Mosteller]] and [[John Tukey|Tukey]] (1977), Nelder (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Nelder, J. A. (1990). The knowledge needed to computerise the analysis and interpretation of statistical information. In ''Expert systems and artificial intelligence: the need for information about data''. Library Association Report, London, March, 23–27.&lt;/ref&gt; described continuous counts, continuous ratios, count ratios, and categorical modes of data. See also Chrisman (1998), van den Berg (1991).&lt;ref&gt;van den Berg, G. (1991). ''Choosing an analysis method''. Leiden: DSWO Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mosteller and Tukey's typology (1977) ====
Mosteller and Tukey&lt;ref name="Mosteller"/&gt; noted that the four levels are not exhaustive and proposed:
# Names
# Grades (ordered labels like beginner, intermediate, advanced)
# Ranks (orders with 1 being the smallest or largest, 2 the next smallest or largest, and so on)
# Counted fractions (bound by 0 and 1)
# Counts (non-negative integers)
# Amounts (non-negative real numbers)
# Balances (any real number)

For example, percentages (a variation on fractions in the Mosteller-Tukey framework) do not fit well into Stevens’s framework: No transformation is fully admissible.&lt;ref name = "Velleman and Wilkinson 1993" /&gt;

==== Chrisman's typology (1998) ====
Nicholas R. Chrisman &lt;ref name="Chrisman"/&gt; introduced an expanded list of levels of measurement to account for various measurements that do not necessarily fit with the traditional notions of levels of measurement. Measurements bound to a range and repeating (like degrees in a circle, clock time, etc.), graded membership categories, and other types of measurement do not fit to Stevens's original work, leading to the introduction of six new levels of measurement, for a total of ten:
# Nominal
# Gradation of membership
# Ordinal
# Interval
# Log-interval
# Extensive ratio
# Cyclical ratio
# Derived ratio
# Counts
# Absolute

While some claim that the extended levels of measurement are rarely used outside of academic geography,&lt;ref name = "Wolman 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Measurement and meaningfulness in conservation science |journal=Conservation Biology |year=2006 |last=Wolman |first=Abel G |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00531.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; graded membership is central to fuzzy set theory, while absolute measurements include probabilities and the plausibility and ignorance in Dempster-Shafer theory. Cyclical ratio measurements include angles and times. Counts appear to be ratio measurements, but the scale is not arbitrary and fractional counts are commonly meaningless. Log-interval measurements are commonly displayed in stock market graphics. All these types of measurements are commonly used outside academic geography, and do not fit well to Stevens' original work.

=== Scale types and Stevens's "operational theory of measurement" ===
The theory of scale types is the intellectual handmaiden to Stevens's "operational theory of measurement", which was to become definitive within psychology and the [[behavioral sciences]],{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} despite Michell's characterization as its being quite at odds with measurement in the natural sciences (Michell, 1999). Essentially, the operational theory of measurement was a reaction to the conclusions of a committee established in 1932 by the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] to investigate the possibility of genuine scientific measurement in the psychological and behavioral sciences. This committee, which became known as the ''Ferguson committee'', published a Final Report (Ferguson, et al., 1940, p.&amp;nbsp;245) in which Stevens's [[sone]] scale (Stevens &amp; Davis, 1938) was an object of criticism:

{{quote | …any law purporting to express a quantitative relation between sensation intensity and stimulus intensity is not merely false but is in fact meaningless unless and until a meaning can be given to the concept of addition as applied to sensation.}}

That is, if Stevens's ''[[sone]]'' scale genuinely measured the intensity of auditory sensations, then evidence for such sensations as being quantitative attributes needed to be produced. The evidence needed was the presence of ''additive structure'' – a concept comprehensively treated by the German mathematician [[Otto Hölder]] (Hölder, 1901). Given that the physicist and measurement theorist [[Norman Robert Campbell]] dominated the Ferguson committee's deliberations, the committee concluded that measurement in the social sciences was impossible due to the lack of [[concatenation (mathematics)|concatenation]] operations. This conclusion was later rendered false by the discovery of the [[theory of conjoint measurement]] by Debreu (1960) and independently by Luce &amp; Tukey (1964). However, Stevens's reaction was not to conduct experiments to test for the presence of additive structure in sensations, but instead to render the conclusions of the Ferguson committee null and void by proposing a new theory of measurement:

{{quote|Paraphrasing N. R. Campbell (Final Report, p.340), we may say that measurement, in the broadest sense, is defined as the assignment of numerals to objects and events according to rules (Stevens, 1946, p.677).}}

Stevens was greatly influenced by the ideas of another Harvard academic, the [[Nobel prize|Nobel laureate]] physicist [[Percy Bridgman]] (1927), whose doctrine of ''operationism'' Stevens used to define measurement. In Stevens's definition, for example, it is the use of a tape measure that defines length (the object of measurement) as being measurable (and so by implication quantitative). Critics of operationism object that it confuses the relations between two objects or events for properties of one of those of objects or events (Hardcastle, 1995; Michell, 1999; Moyer, 1981a,b; Rogers, 1989).

The Canadian measurement theorist [[William Rozeboom]] (1966) was an early and trenchant critic of Stevens's theory of scale types.

==== Same variable may be different scale type depending on context ====
Another issue is that the same variable may be a different scale type depending on how it is measured and on the goals of the analysis. For example, hair color is usually thought of as a nominal variable, since it has no apparent ordering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/whatstat/nominal_ordinal_interval.htm|title=What is the difference between categorical, ordinal and interval variables?|work=Institute for Digital Research and Education|publisher=University of California, Los Angeles|access-date=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible to order colors (including hair colors) in various ways, including by hue; this is known as [[colorimetry]]. Hue is an interval level variable.

The '''Levington Research Station''' is a [[Fertilizer|fertiliser]] research institute in [[Suffolk]].

==History==
===Fisons===
It was opened by Fisons in 1957.&lt;ref name="nationalarchives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/fd186eaf-d392-4d67-a1ef-bebabbd4d6ef|title=Fisons Fertilizers Limited - Levington Research Station Handbooks|website=The National Archives|accessdate=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received a Civic Trust Award in 1959.&lt;ref name="civictrustawards"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.civictrustawards.org.uk/benet/schemes/levington-research-station|title=Levington Research Station|website=Civic Trust Awards|accessdate=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisons sold the property in 1981.

Around three hundred people worked at the site and it was one of Europe's largest research institutes in the field of fertiliser.

==Structure==
It is in the [[Suffolk Coastal]] district of Suffolk.

They were originally mapped by Iberall by drawing a series of circles over a portion of the body and then watching their deformations as the wearer walked around or performed various tasks. The circles deform into ellipses as the skin stretches over the moving musculature, and these deformations were recorded. After a huge number of such measurements the data is then examined to find all of the possible deformations of the circles, and more importantly, the non-moving points on them where the original circle and the deformed ellipse intersect (at four points per circle). By mapping these points over the entire body, a series of lines are produced.

These lines may then be used to direct the placement of tension elements in a [[spacesuit]] to enable constant suit pressure regardless of the motion of the body.&lt;ref name=Newman2005/&gt;

Load path analysis can be used to minimize the material needed in the load-bearing member to support the design load.

Load path analysis may be performed using the concept of a load transfer index, U*.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2015|others=|title=Load Transfer Index for Composite Materials|url=http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2501162|journal=ASME 2015 International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition|volume=|issue=|page=|doi=10.1115/IMECE2015-51176|pmid=|author=Qingguo Wang et al}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2016|others=|title=Extensions of the U* Theory for Applications on Orthotropic Composites and Nonlinear Elastic Materials|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10999-016-9348-z?view=classic|journal=International Journal of Mechanics and Materials in Design|volume=|issue=|page=1-12|doi=10.1007/s10999-016-9348-z|pmid=|author=Qingguo Wang et al}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2017|others=|title=Experimental Validation of U* index Theory for Load Transfer Analysis|url=|journal=International Journal of Heavy Vehicle System|volume=24|issue=3|page=288-304|doi=|pmid=|author=Khashayar Pejhan; Qingguo Wang}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2017|others=|title=Design assessment of a multiple passenger vehicle component using load transfer index (U*) method|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10999-017-9372-7|journal=International Journal of Mechanics and Materials in Design|volume=|issue=|page=1-17|doi=10.1007/s10999-017-9372-7|pmid=|author=Pejhan, Khashayar; Kuznetcov, Anton; Wang, Qingguo}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In a structure, the main portion of the load is transferred through the stiffest route. The U* index represents the internal stiffness of every point within the structure. Consequently, the line connecting the highest U* values is the main load path. In other words, the main load path is the ridge line of the U* distribution (contour) &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This method of analysis has been verified in physical experimentation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Load path calculation using U* index ==
In a structure, the main portion of the load is transferred through the stiffest route. The U* index represents the internal stiffness of every point within the structure. Consequently, the line connecting the highest U* values is the main load path. In other words, the main load path is the ridge line of the U* distribution (contour). &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The U* index theory has been validated through two different physical experiments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Since the U* index predicts the load paths based on the structural stiffness, it is not affected by the stress concentration problems. The load transfer analysis using the U* index is a new design paradigm for vehicle structural design. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It has been applied in design analysis and optimization by automotive manufacturers like [[Honda]] and [[Nissan]].

[[File:Load paths.jpg|thumb|right|200px|a): load paths based on U* index; b): [[von Mises yield criterion|von Mises stress distribution]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;]]
In the image to the right, a structural member with a central hole is placed under load bearing stress. Figure (a) shows the U* distribution and the resultant load paths while figure (b) is the [[von Mises yield criterion|von Mises Stress distribution]]. As can be seen from figure (b), higher stresses can be observed at the vicinity of the hole. However, it is unreasonable to conclude the main load passes that area with stress concentration because the hole (which has no material) is not important for carrying the load. The stress concentration caused by the structural singularities like a hole or a notch makes the load transfer analysis more difficult.

[[Image:MSCP Generic Poster.PNG|thumb|right|MSCP Poster outlining the various activities of the organisation. [http://www.mscp.org.au/ MSCP Website]]]

The '''Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy''' ('''MSCP''') is an institution dedicated to scholarly, extensive and engaged readings of key figures and texts in the history of modern European thought and contemporary discourse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscp.org.au MSCP Identity Statement]&lt;/ref&gt; The School was founded in 2003 and formalised its status as an independent, [[not-for-profit]] organisation in 2004. It is based in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] and is housed by [[The University of Melbourne]].

== Formation and early years ==

In January 2002, Cameron Shingleton, Jon Roffe, Matt Sharpe and David Rathbone ran a summer school with four courses (on Nietzsche, on Deleuze, on Zizek and on Hegel, respectively) in the 1888 Building at the University of Melbourne.  Sharpe had just finished his PhD on Zizek with Marion Tapper and Jon Rundell at Melbourne; Rathbone had returned to Melbourne from studies with Agnes Heller and Reiner Schurmann at the New School for Social Research in New York; Shingleton had completed his honors degree on Nietzsche in the German department; and Roffe his, in French.  All four were of the opinion that the formalities of institutional academia alone were not sufficient to undertaking philosophical and critical thought. They thus formed the MSCP in the spirit of a [[guild]] of philosophers with the intention of preserving and fostering genuine intellectual engagement with continental philosophy. In 2003, they were joined by Sean Ryan, Craig Barrie, and Ashley Woodward, and later, Esther Anatolitis, Felicity Joseph, Jack Reynolds, Kate Noble, Alex Murray, Atliana Safich, Mark Tomlinson, Marc Hiatt, James Garrett, Bryan Cooke, Paul Daniels, Andrea Leon-Martino, and Sherah Bloor, all of whom have all been involved in various ways during the five years 2004-2009, running annual Summer and Winter Schools, as well as several conferences and research days.

== Events and activities ==
===Summer and Winter Schools===

The MSCP runs Summer and Winter Schools at the University of Melbourne during the university vacation breaks. Courses in the Schools consist of five two-hour lectures over a week and do not involve assessment or require any demonstrated prior knowledge of the topic in question. As the MSCP is a not-for-profit organisation, registration costs are minimal.

MSCP courses seek a detailed and scholarly encounter with philosophical thinkers and themes. In particular, the courses attempt to promote constructive ways of engaging with philosophy which are not widely represented in contemporary academic discourse. The courses aim to locate philosophy in the context of its historical and cultural milieu, encouraging lively, academic debate, emphasising the interdisciplinary aspects of philosophy. Classes are informal but strive to be rigorous and faithful to the philosophers and texts being studied.

Past courses have covered philosophers such as [[Hegel]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Heidegger]], [[Wittgenstein]], [[Lyotard]], [[Derrida]], [[Deleuze]] and [[Badiou]]. A series of courses has run over several Summer and Winter Schools entitled 'MSCP History of Philosophy Series' which assessed philosophy from the [[pre-Socratics]] to [[modern empiricism]]. Similar courses, treating a theme rather than a particular philosopher or text, have included 'Three Centuries of Aphorism' and 'Democracy, Elites and Violence'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscp.org.au/past.html MSCP past sessions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conferences===

The MSCP has run conferences including:

* 2002 Australasian Society of Continental Philosophy conference at the University of Melbourne (the MSCP hosted this conference in conjunction with the Department of Philosophy at the University of Melbourne),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascp.org.au/conferences.htm ASCP 2002 conference]&lt;/ref&gt; held in December 2002
* 'Immanuel Kant Today', commemorating the 200th anniversary of the death of [[Immanuel Kant]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscp.org.au/kant_papers.html Immanuel Kant Today conference]&lt;/ref&gt; held in February 2004
* 'Sensorium', a conference on philosophy and [[aesthetics]], held in June 2005
* '[[Sartre]] Colloquium' which included a performance of ''[[Huis Clos]]'' (held in conjunction with the Department of French, Italian and Spanish Studies and the Department of Philosophy), held in October 2005
* '200 Years of Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au/community/events/starters/archive/arts-starters-06-27-07.html "200 Years of Hegel's ''Phenomenology of Spirit''"]&lt;/ref&gt; held in July 2007

===Research days===

The MSCP has initiated a series of research days where philosophers in a particular field converge on a specific topic and workshop their papers together. So far, "[[Spinoza]] and the [[Infinity (philosophy)|Infinite]]", convened by Jon Roffe was held in December 2005 and was attended by [[Justin Clemens]], Simon Duffy, Minna Koivuniemi and Jon Roffe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscp.org.au/research/spinoza_infinite.html 'Spinoza and the Infinite' research day]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Parrhesia'' Journal ===
''[[Parrhesia: A Journal of Critical Philosophy]]'' is an international journal of [[Critical Philosophy]] affiliated with MSCP. It is edited by four MSCP members: Alex Murray, Matthew Sharpe, Jon Roffe and Ashley Woodward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org Parrhesia Journal website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/anbd.bib-an000041083174 National Library of Australia entry for Parrhesia Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in 2006 and has included articles by [[Alain Badiou]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia02/parrhesia02_badiou1.pdf Badiou, Alain, "A musical variant on the metaphysics of the subject", trans.

== The MSCP and the University of Melbourne ==

[[File:Old Arts Building, University of Melbourne.jpg|thumb|right|The Old Law Quadrangle at the University of Melbourne, home to the School of Philosophy. The MSCP office is located in this building.]]
 
During 2004, the founding Convenor, Jon Roffe, negotiated an informal relationship between the MSCP and the Philosophy Department with Chris Cordner (then Head of the Philosophy Department).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ Link to the MSCP via the School of Philosophy website ]&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the MSCP to undertake its activities using an office in the Department and University of Melbourne resources and teaching spaces. Late 2004, the MSCP invited Dr Marion Tapper of the University of Melbourne Philosophy Department to become a member. This merely formalised her involvement as she had always been supportive of the MSCP both philosophically and on account of knowing all of its members personally from teaching and supervision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/staff/tr.html Marion Tapper, School of Philosophy staff profile]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One way in which the MSCP attempts to transcend its university boundaries is by seeking new ways to teach and engage with philosophy.  In particular, MSCP events strive to be both informal and rigorous. With their courses offering no credit or assessment, students who attend are usually there for the joy of philosophy and seek to further their own intellects outside of a formal classroom setting. Being a not-for-profit organisation, the MSCP charges a minimum for its courses; again, this is aimed at transcending the current economic climate of university funding.

== Membership ==

New members are typically recommended by current members and, largely because the organisation was founded by postgraduate students, they are usually honours year or postgraduate students themselves.

'''''Mental Models''''' is a book published by [[Lawrence Erlbaum Associates]], Inc., in 1983 {{ISBN|0-89859-242-9}}.  It was edited by [[Dedre Gentner]] and Albert L. Stevens, both employees of [[Bolt, Beranek and Newman]], Inc. at the time.  It appeared at about the same time as a book by the same name by [[Philip Johnson-Laird]].  According to the [[acknowledgment (creative arts)|acknowledgment]] of the book, it resulted from a workshop on [[mental model]]s held at the [[University of California, San Diego]] in October 1980, that was jointly sponsored by the [[Office of Naval Research]] and the [[Sloan Foundation]].

==Chapters==
#Some Observations on Mental Models — [[Donald A. Norman]], [[UCSD]]
#:Dr. Norman describes the properties of mental models — that they can be contradictory, incomplete, superstitious, erroneous, and unstable, varying in time.  So the job of system designers is to help users form an accurate and useful mental model of a system.  And the job of researchers is to set up experiments to learn to understand actual mental models, even though they may be messy and incomplete.

== Reception ==
Upon release, ''Mental Models'' received reviews from journals such as ''[[American Anthropologist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Review of Mental Models|jstor = 679637|journal = American Anthropologist|date = 1983-01-01|pages = 1002–1004|volume = 85|issue = 4|first = Willett|last = Kempton|first2 = Jean|last2 = Lave|doi=10.1525/aa.1983.85.4.02a00640}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[American Journal of Psychology|The American Journal of Psychology]]'' reviewed the work, stating that it would be of interest to "those who are concerned with what is new in cognitive science".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Review of Mental Models|jstor = 1422536|journal = The American Journal of Psychology|date = 1984-01-01|pages = 467–469|volume = 97|issue = 3|doi = 10.2307/1422536|first = Richard E.|last = Mayer|first2 = Piraye|last2 = Bayman}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Instructional Science'' also wrote a review, writing "''Mental Models'' succeeds as an introduction to the vigorous, multidisciplinary attack on the ethereal problems surrounding knowledge representation.

==History==
In 1975, [[Bill Gates]] and [[Paul Allen]] were working on [[Altair BASIC]], which they were developing at [[Harvard University]] on a [[PDP-10]] running their Altair [[emulator]].&lt;ref name="dawn"&gt;{{cite web |author-last=Ireland |author-first=Corydon |url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/09/dawn-of-a-revolution |title=Dawn of a revolution &amp;#124; Harvard Gazette |publisher=news.harvard.edu |access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; One thing still missing was code to handle floating-point numbers, needed to support calculations with very big and very small numbers,&lt;ref name="dawn"/&gt; which would be particularly useful for science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0898122187901817 |doi=10.1016/0898-1221(87)90181-7 |volume=14 |title=An introduction to the scientific computing language Pascal-SC |journal=Computers |pages=53–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cis.poly.edu/~mleung/CS3734/s05/ch01/floatingPoints2.pdf |format=PDF |title=Floating-Point Numbers in Digital Computers |author-first=K.

[[File:Altair 8800 at the Computer History Museum, cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Altair 8800]] front panel]]
At a dinner at [[Currier House (Harvard College)|Currier House]], an undergraduate residential house at Harvard, Gates and Allen complained to their dinner companions about having to write this code.&lt;ref name="dawn"/&gt; One of them, [[Monte Davidoff]], told them that he had written floating-point routines before and convinced Gates and Allen that he was capable of writing the Altair BASIC floating-point code.&lt;ref name="dawn"/&gt; At the time there was no standard for floating-point numbers, so Davidoff had to come up with his own. He decided that 32 bits would allow enough range and precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://altairbasic.org/math_ex.htm |title=Altair BASIC 3.2 (4K Edition) |publisher=altairbasic.org |access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Allen had to demonstrate it to [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems|MITS]], it was the first time it ran on an actual Altair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/05/11/microsoft_altair_basic_legend_talks/ |title=Microsoft Altair BASIC legend talks about Linux, CPRM and that very frightening photo |website=theregister.co.uk |access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it worked, and when he entered ‘PRINT 2+2’, Davidoff's adding routine gave the correct answer.&lt;ref name="dawn"/&gt;

The source code for Altair BASIC was thought to have been lost to history, but resurfaced in 2000. It had been sitting behind Gates's former tutor and dean [[Harry R. Lewis|Harry Lewis]]'s file cabinet, who rediscovered it.&lt;ref name="raiders"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/05/13/raiders_of_the_lost_altair/ |title=Raiders of the Lost Altair BASIC Source Code |website=theregister.co.uk |access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quest"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rjh.org.uk/altair/ian.htm |title=Quest for the Holy Source - Ian's trip to Harvard |publisher=web.archive.org |access-date=2016-05-30 |dead-url=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020102173701/http://www.rjh.org.uk/altair/ian.htm |archive-date=2002-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comment in the source credits Davidoff as the writer of Altair BASIC's math package.&lt;ref name="raiders"/&gt;&lt;ref name="quest"/&gt;

Altair BASIC took off, and soon most early home computers ran some form of Microsoft BASIC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcomputers.net/important-computer-people.html |title=Important computer inventors |publisher=Oldcomputers.net |access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://comp.lang.basic.powerbasic.narkive.com/erBpXdwr/basic-7-0-for-windows#post4 |title=Basic 7.0 for Windows |publisher=comp.lang.basic.powerbasic.narkive.com |access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BASIC port for the [[6502]] CPU, such as used in the [[Commodore PET]], took up more space due to the lower code density of the 6502. Because of this it would likely not fit in a single ROM chip together with the machine-specific input and output code. Since an extra chip was necessary, extra space was available, and this was used in part to extend the floating-point format from 32 to 40 bits.&lt;ref name="Steil_2008"&gt;{{cite web |title=Create your own Version of Microsoft BASIC for 6502 |author-first=Michael |author-last=Steil |publisher=pagetable.com |date=2008-10-20 |url=http://www.pagetable.com/?p=46 |access-date=2016-05-30 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530092603/http://www.pagetable.com/?p=46 |archive-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This extended format was not only provided by [[Commodore BASIC]] 1 &amp; 2, but was also supported by [[AppleSoft BASIC]] I &amp; II since version 1.1 (1977), [[KIM-1]] BASIC since version 1.1a (1977), and [[Tangerine Microtan 65|MicroTAN]] BASIC since version 2b (1980).&lt;ref name="Steil_2008"/&gt; Not long afterwards the [[Z80]] ports, such as [[TRS-80 Level II BASIC|Level II BASIC]] for the [[TRS-80]] (1978), introduced the 64-bit, double-precision format as a separate data type from 32-bit, single-precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/Level_II_BASIC_Reference_Manual_1st_Ed._1978_Radio_Shack |title=Radio Shack Hardware Manual: Level II BASIC Reference Manual 1st Ed.

As early as in 1976, [[Intel]] was starting the development of a floating-point [[coprocessor]].&lt;ref name="case"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/case-studies/floating-point-case-study.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-30 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114859/http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/case-studies/floating-point-case-study.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="story"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/754story.html |title=An Interview with the Old Man of Floating-Point |publisher=cs.berkeley.edu |date=1998-02-20 |access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intel hoped to be able to sell a chip containing good implementations of all the operations found in the widely varying maths software libraries.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt;&lt;ref name="conv"&gt;{{cite web |author-last=Woehr |author-first=Jack |url=http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/a-conversation-with-william-kahan/184410314 |title=A Conversation with William Kahan &amp;#124; Dr. Dobb's |publisher=drdobbs.com |date=1997-11-01 |access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Palmer, who managed the project, contacted [[William Kahan]], who suggested that Intel use the floating point of [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s (DEC) VAX. The first VAX, the [[VAX-11/780]] had just come out in late 1977, and its floating point was highly regarded. However, seeking to market their chip to the broadest possible market, Intel wanted the best floating point possible, and Kahan went on to draw up specifications. When rumours of Intel's new chip reached its competitors, they started a standardization effort, called [[IEEE 754]], to prevent Intel from gaining too much ground. Kahan got Palmer's permission to participate; he was allowed to explain Intel's design decisions and their underlying reasoning, but not anything related to Intel's implementation architecture.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt;&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;&lt;ref name="conv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dr-chuck.com/dr-chuck/papers/columns/r3114.pdf |format=PDF |title=IEEE 754: An Interview with William Kahan |website=dr-chuck.com |access-date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; VAX's floating-point formats differed from MBF only in that it had the sign in the most significant bit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nssdc/formats/VAXFloatingPoint.htm |title=The VAX-11/780 did not implement the "G" format yet. Although this is not directly apparent from the tables because the structures have been cut up in two-byte words, the byte order is actually the same as on modern CPUs.

Both Kahan's proposal and a counter-proposal by DEC therefore used 11 bits, like the time-tested [[CDC 6600#60-bit floating point|60-bit floating-point format]] of the [[CDC 6600]] from 1965.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ygdes.com/CDC/DesignOfAComputer_CDC6600.pdf |format=PDF |title=Design of a Computer: The Control Data 6600 |author-first=J.

The next year DEC had a study done in order to demonstrate that gradual underflow was a bad idea, but the study concluded the opposite, and DEC gave in. In 1985 the standard was ratified, but it had already become the de facto standard a year earlier, implemented by many manufacturers.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/IEEE754.PDF |format=PDF |title=IEEE Standard 754 for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic |author-first=William Morton |author-last=Kahan |website=cs.berkeley.edu |access-date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time [[QuickBASIC 4.00]] was released, the IEEE 754 standard had become widely adopted&amp;mdash;for example, it was incorporated into Intel's [[Intel 387|387]] coprocessor and every [[x86]] processor from the [[Intel 80486|486]] on.  QuickBASIC versions 4.0 and 4.5 use IEEE 754 floating-point variables by default, but (at least in version 4.5) there is a command-line option for the IDE and the compiler that switches from IEEE to MBF floating-point numbers, to support earlier-written programs that rely on details of the MBF data formats.  [[Visual Basic]] also uses the IEEE 754 format instead of MBF.

=={{anchor|32-bit MBF|40-bit MBF|64-bit MBF}}Technical details==
MBF numbers consist of an 8-bit base-2 [[exponent]] with a bias of 128, so that exponents −127...−1 are represented by ''x'' = 1.'.127 (01h...7Fh), exponents 0...127 are represented by ''x'' = 128...255 (80h...FFh), with a special case for ''x'' = 0 (00h) representing the whole number being zero, a sign [[bit]] (positive mantissa: ''s'' = 0; negative mantissa: ''s'' = 1) and a 23-,&lt;ref name="Steil_2008"/&gt; 31-&lt;ref name="Steil_2008"/&gt; or 55-bit mantissa of the [[significand]].  There is always a 1-bit implied to the left of the explicit mantissa, and the [[radix point]] is located before this [[assumed bit]]&lt;!-- whereas IEEE locates it afterwards --&gt;. The MBF double-precision format provides less scale than the [[IEEE 754]] format, and although the format itself provides almost one extra decimal digit of precision, in practice the stored values are less accurate because IEEE calculations use 80-bit intermediate results, and MBF doesn't.&lt;ref name="kb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="masm50"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.embarcadero.com/index.php/article/technical-articles/162-programming/14799-converting-between-microsoft-binary-and-ieee-forma |title=Converting between Microsoft Binary and IEEE forma |publisher=Embarcadero |access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.os.msdos.programmer/mDyRI1wolAc |title=Google Groups |website=Groups.google.com |access-date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike IEEE floating point, MBF doesn't support [[denormal number]]s, [[Infinity|infinities]] or [[NaN]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boyet.com/Articles/MBFSinglePrecision.html |title=julian m bucknall &gt;&gt; Understanding single precision MBF |publisher=boyet.com |access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- By the way, you can easily check this yourself using GW-BASIC. Evaluating ‘?CVS(STRING$(2,0)+CHR$(64)+CHR$(129))’ (for single precision) or ‘?CVD(STRING$(6,0)+CHR$(64)+CHR$(129))’ (for double precision) will yield 1.5 as expected. You can vary the numbers and see what the result is. As you increase the exponent you just get bigger numbers as it reaches 255, instead of infinities and NaNs as in IEEE. If the exponent is zero, the result will equal 0, according to GW-BASIC. --&gt;

* Microsoft [https://web.archive.org/web/20101026203154/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/140520 provides] a dynamic link library for 16-bit Visual Basic containing functions to convert between MBF data and IEEE 754.
**This library wraps the MBF conversion functions in the 16-bit Visual C(++) CRT.
**These conversion functions will round an IEEE double precision number like ¾ ⋅ 2&lt;sup&gt;−128&lt;/sup&gt; to zero rather than to 2&lt;sup&gt;−128&lt;/sup&gt;.
**They don't support denormals at all: the IEEE or MBF single precision number 2&lt;sup&gt;−128&lt;/sup&gt; will be converted to zero even though it is representable in either format.
**This library is only intended for use with Visual Basic; C(++) programs are expected to call the CRT functions directly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8226">The '''Military Writers Society of America''', also known as the '''MWSA''', is non-profit, 501(c)3 association of authors, poets, and artists, many of whom are U.S. military veterans or family members of veterans.  Membership is open to anyone with an interest in, affinity for, or connection to the military.

The organization provides a venue for meeting other authors and artists, sharing ideas and learning about writing and the publishing industry.  Its goals are: 
(a) to improve writing skills of its members, and
(b) to reach out to schools, military organizations and veterans’ groups to foster and encourage an interest in writing, and
(c) to recognize the accomplishments of its members' work in literature and the communication arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/559a3339e4b059a64f95b0ae/t/59929c74d2b8572bae2c5cc5/1502780533165/MWSA_ByLaws.pdf|website=MWSA Bylaws|title=Bylaws of the Military Writers Society of America |accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization also reviews and considers for award books and other forms of art and literature each year.  Annual award winners are announced during an awards banquet, which is normally held during the organization's annual general membership conference.

The experience level and relative success of the membership varies widely, from relatively obscure, first-time writers to [[Bestseller|best-selling]] authors like [[Joe Buff]], [[Gayle Lynds]], [[Dale Dye]], and [[Joseph Badal]].

==History==
The Military Writers Society of America was the brainchild of its founder and first president,  [[W. H. (Rev. Bill) McDonald Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;http://sbiands.org/rev-bill-mcdonald/&lt;/ref&gt;  A crew chief/door-gunner on UH-1D Huey helicopters in 1966 and 1967, Bill flew with the 128th Helicopter Assault Company  out of [[Phu Loi Base Camp|Phu Loi]], South Vietnam. He was awarded numerous medals, including: the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze Star, fourteen Air Medals and the Purple Heart.

Like most who encounter the moral extremes of combat, Bill discovered that war is a crucible of spiritual transformation.  It is, quite simply, impossible to live through that sort of experience and not be changed by it.  To better understand his own experiences, Bill began to write about them. In the years since, he has discovered literally hundreds of other warriors who are driven to explore and reveal their experiences through fiction, non-fiction, poetry and art.   It was Bill's vision to bring them together to share and promote their respective arts. With more than 1200 members, the Military Writers Society of America is that vision brought to life.

The MWSA started off as branch of ''The American Authors Association'' (''AAA'')&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanauthorsassociation.com/&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming a fully separated organization of its own.  There are annual awards given for books, music Cds and short films.

The current President of MWSA is NY Times Best Selling Author Dwight Zimmerman.&lt;ref&gt;https://us.macmillan.com/author/dwightjonzimmerman/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Dwight_Jon_Zimmerman&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous president was Joyce Faulkner. She is a ghostwriter, an editor and a web, newspaper &amp; book designer. She has been a member of MWSA since 2006. Her goal is to help veterans record their piece of history—for themselves, their families, their communities—and our country, to make sure that all of our history is recorded and recognized. Her interest in military writing stems from her book ''In the Shadow of Suribachi'', the story of her father's experiences as a young Marine at the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwsadispatches.com/leadership/ |title=MWSA Leadership |publisher=Military Writers |date= |accessdate=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second president of the MWSA after the Founder McDonald stepped down for health reasons was Tony Lazzarini - a Vietnam combat veteran. After returning to the states, Tony worked for IBM as a service technician on communicating systems with their advanced products group. He left after 10 years to open his own high performance automotive shop. Along with racing and building cars, his other passions include writing and motorcycles. Tony started Voyager Publishing and his writing accomplishments include two award-winning books, a prize-winning musical stage play and two short films.

Operated by [[Sandia National Laboratories]] for the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE), the '''National Solar Thermal Test Facility''' ('''NSTTF''') is the only test facility of this type in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=1267 |title=Sandia National Laboratories: National Solar Thermal Test Facility |publisher=Energy.sandia.gov |date=2012-09-27 |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSTTF’s primary goal is to provide experimental engineering data for the design, construction, and operation of unique components and systems in proposed solar thermal electrical plants planned for large-scale power generation.

The site was built and instrumented to provide test facilities for a variety of solar and non-solar applications. The facility can provide

* high heat flux and temperatures for materials testing or aerodynamic heating simulation
* large fields of optics for astronomical observations or satellite calibrations
* solar furnace
* rotating platform for parabolic trough evaluation.

National Solar Thermal Test Facility
During the late 1970s, rising fuel costs and the demand for a cleaner environment gave impetus to advance technology which used solar energy to create electricity.  Studies identified the central receiver concept as having high potential to generate electricity on a large scale.  The United States government initiated support through the [[National Science Foundation]] [[Research Applied to National Needs]] (RANN) program in 1972 which was eventually funded by the [[Energy Research and Development Administration]] and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]].  Six central receiver pilot plants were constructed including the 5 MW (thermal) test facility at [[Sandia National Laboratories]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuntz, Patricia Falcone, Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, "A Handbook for Solar Central Receiver Design." SAND 86-8009 Unlimited Release. 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facility overview==

===Heliostat field===
[[Image:NSTTF heliostat field.jpg|thumb|right|The [[heliostat]] field at Sandia National. Labs.]]
The heliostat field has 218 individual heliostats. This capability directly supports the SunShot goals by providing flux levels of greater than 250 W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and total power in excess of 6 MWt. Each heliostat has two motors and two drives (one azimuth and one elevation), one 480 V power box, one electronics box, and one control box and associated cabling. The total reflective area on each heliostat is 37 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The reflectivity on the recently replaced facets is 96%.

===Solar tower===
[[Image:NSTTF SolarTower Sandia National Labs.jpg|thumb|right|The [[solar power tower]] field at Sandia National. Labs.]]
The tower is a 61&amp;nbsp;m (200&amp;nbsp;ft) high concrete structure with three test locations on the north side and the top of the tower. The tower can support testing for CSP experiments and large-scale, high-flux materials samples. The equipment in the tower includes a 100-ton capacity elevating module for lifting experiments to the top of the tower, internal cranes for receiver fabrication, water glycol cooling systems and air coolers to provide heat removal from experiments, air compressors, control valves, generators, uninterruptible power supplies, piping systems, and pressure-relief valves.

===Molten salt test loop===
The molten salt test loop directly supports the SunShot goals by providing development for thermal energy storage costs ≤$15/kWhth and by allowing greater collection efficiencies and higher-temperature operation for linear Fresnel and trough systems through utilization of molten salt HTF. The facility also provides a means of performing accelerated lifetime testing on components, thus reducing the risk of the technology. Though operating below 600&amp;nbsp;°C, many of the lessons learned at this facility will be directly applicable to molten salt systems operating in the SunShot temperature range ≥ 650&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=11934 |title=Sandia National Laboratories: Molten Salt Test Loop |publisher=Energy.sandia.gov |date=2012-10-08 |accessdate=2012-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218180903/http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=11934 |archivedate=2013-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dish test facility===
This area of the site allows industry partners to install full-scale solar dishes for long-term reliability testing and evaluation. There are currently ten dishes from [[Stirling Energy Systems]] and six [[Infinia]] dishes at this location. The site also includes two SNL-developed solar dishes that are available for research. Solar dishes can be used for the high-temperature portions of the SunShot goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=11958 |title=Sandia National Laboratories: Dish Test Facility |publisher=Energy.sandia.gov |date=2012-09-26 |accessdate=2012-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218181207/http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=11958 |archivedate=2013-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Out-of-box experience''' ('''OOBE''' pronounced oo-bee) is the experience a consumer (or user) has when preparing to first use a new product. In relation to computing, this includes the setup process of installing and/or performing initial configuration of a piece of [[computer hardware|hardware]] or [[software]] on a [[computer]]. This generally follows the [[point-of-sale]] or the interaction of an expert user.

==Overview==
The out-of-box experience is typically the first impression a product creates, such as the ease with which a buyer can begin using the product. For hardware products, a positive OOBE can be created with logical easy-to-follow instructions and good quality of manufacturing.

For software, this often means easy [[software installation|installation]] and "Welcome" or "Initial Configuration" [[Wizard (software)|wizard]] screens that simplify elaborate set-up. The OOBE can also include the complete lack of such wizards.

The process of installing [[Microsoft Windows]] is a common example for OOBE. While the installation is largely automatic, the user must proceed through multiple screens to acknowledge software license terms, specify [[Disk partitioning|partition]] settings for the [[hard disk]], enter the "[[product key]]", select international settings, a [[time zone]], and also configure [[Computer networking|network]] settings. After the installation is complete, Microsoft Windows launches the "out-of-box application that presents a full-screen [[Wizard (software)|wizard]] to assist the user with critical first steps of using Windows, such as creating a user account, registering the software with Microsoft (optional), configuring Internet connectivity, and product activation. Although this Microsoft application is named after OOBE, the real OOBE began when the user first turned on a new computer and was taken through the initial setup.

== Negative experiences ==
For poor out-of-box experiences, the specific term [[Out of box failure|out-of-box failure]] (OOBF or OBF) has been coined to describe immediate product failures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6487">[[File:Point of view bias.jpg|thumb|Point of view. Two people are looking at the same object and interpreting it differently due to a different point of view]]
In [[philosophy]], a '''point of view''' is a specified or stated manner of consideration,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/point_of_view "Point of view"], Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. 31 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  an attitude how one sees or thinks of something,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/point_of_view "Point of view"] The American Heritage® Dictionary of Idioms by Christine Ammer. Houghton Mifflin Company. 31 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; as in "from my personal point of view". This figurative usage of the expression as attested since 1760.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/point_of_view "Point of view."] Online Etymology Dictionary. Douglas Harper, Historian. 31 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In this meaning, the usage is synonymous with one of the meanings of the term '''perspective'''.&lt;ref name="Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 2"&gt;Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LMPS14 /&gt;

==Analysis==
Margarita Vázquez Campos and Antonio Manuel Liz Gutiérrez in their work, "The Notion of Point of View", give a comprehensive analysis of the structure of the concept. They point out that despite being crucial in many discourses, the notion has not been adequately analyzed, though some important works do exist.&lt;ref name="Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 2"/&gt; They mention that early classical Greek philosophers, starting from [[Parmenides]] and [[Heraclitus]] discussed the relation between "appearance" and reality, i.e., how our points of view are connected with reality.&lt;ref&gt;Campos-Gutiérrez, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; They specifically point out [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s  ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''. They consider Wittgenstein's theory of "pictures" or "models" (Wittgenstein used the German word ''Bild'', which means both "picture" and "model") as an illustration of the relationship between points of view and reality.&lt;ref&gt;Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the "point of view" is highly multifunctional and ambiguous. Many things may be judged from certain personal, traditional or moral points of view (as in "the beauty is in the eye of the beholder"). Our knowledge about reality is often relative to a certain point of view.&lt;ref name="Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 2"/&gt;

Vázquez Campos and Manuel Liz Gutierrez suggested to analyse the concept of "point of view" using two approaches: one based on the concept of "[[propositional attitude]]s", the other on the concepts of "location" and "access".&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Liz, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propositional attitudes===
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
The internal structure of a point of view may be analysed similarly to the concept of a  propositional attitude. A propositional attitude is an attitude, i.e., a mental state held by an agent toward a [[proposition]]. Examples of such attitudes are "to believe in something", "to desire something", "to guess something", "to remember something", etc. Vazques Campos and Gutierrez  suggest that points of view may be analyzed as structured sets of propositional attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The authors draw on [[Christopher Peacocke]]'s ''Sense and Content''.&lt;ref name=LMPS14/&gt;

Within this approach one may carry out [[ontology|ontological]] classification of various distinctions, such as individual vs. collective points of view, personal vs. non-personal,  non-conceptual vs. conceptual, etc.&lt;ref name=LMPS14&gt;Manuel Liz &amp; Margarita Vázquez, [https://www.academia.edu/913996/C2._Cognitive_Science_Two_approaches_to_the_notion_of_Point_of_View_Manuel_Liz_and_Margarita_V%C3%A1zquez "Two approaches to the notion of Point of View"], extended abstract for: [http://www.clmps2011.org/fileadmin/user_upload/VolumeOfAbstracts_FINAL.pdf ''14th Congress of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920152028/http://www.clmps2011.org/fileadmin/user_upload/VolumeOfAbstracts_FINAL.pdf |date=2015-09-20 }}, July 19–26, 2011 (retrieved August 31, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location and access===
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
{{See also|Privileged access|Emic and etic}}
Whereas propositional attitudes approach is to analyze points of view internally, the "location/access" approach analyzes points of view externally, by their role. The term "access" refers to the statement of Liz Gutierrez that "points of views, or perspectives, are ways of having access to the world and to ourselves", and the term "location" is in reference to the provided quotation of [[Jon Moline]] that points of view are "ways of viewing things and events from certain locations". Moline rejects the notion that points of view are reducible to some rules based on some theories, maxims or dogmas. Moline considers the concept of "location" in two ways: in a direct way as a vantage point, and in an extended way, the way how a given vantage point provides a perspective, i.e., influences the perception.&lt;ref&gt;Moline, Jon, "On Points of View", American Philosophical Quarterly, 1968, vol. 5, 191–298. (as cited by Manuel Liz)&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach may address [[epistemology|epistemological]] issues, such as [[relativism]], existence of the absolute point of view, compatibility of points of view (including "[[faultless disagreement]]"), possibility of a point of view without a bearer, etc.&lt;ref name=LMPS14/&gt;

'''Popular history''' is a broad and somewhat ill-defined [[genre]] of [[historiography]] that takes a popular approach, aims at a wide readership, and usually emphasizes [[narrative]], [[Personality type|personality]] and vivid detail over scholarly analysis. The term is used in contradistinction to professional academic or scholarly history writing which is usually more specialized and technical and, thus, less accessible to the general reader.

Some popular historians are without academic affiliation while others are academics, or former academics, that have (according to one writer) "become somehow abstracted from the academic arena, becoming cultural commentators".&lt;ref&gt;De Groot, Jerome (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hexpdOj8t80C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=%22popular+historian%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yvNFz2kvUh&amp;sig=io51iX8gENuqr0egzP2J9JpLwGM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZBSxSpqCKYmf8Qbh7MHCDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22popular%20historian%22&amp;f=false ''Consuming History: Historians and Heritage in Contemporary Popular Culture''], [[Routledge]], pg 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Many worked as journalists, perhaps after taking an initial degree in history.

Popular historians may become nationally renowned or best-selling authors and may or may not serve the interests of particular political viewpoints in their roles as "public historians". Many authors of "official histories" and "authorized biographies" would qualify as popular historians serving the interests of particular institutions or public figures.

Popular historians aim to appear on the "general lists" of general publishers, rather than the [[university press]]es that have dominated [[academic publishing]] in recent years. Increasingly, popular historians have taken to television where they are able, often accompanying a series of documentaries with a [[tie-in]] book.

==Examples==
Recent examples of American popular historians with academic affiliations include [[Stephen Ambrose]], [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]] and [[Pauline Maier]]. Non-academics include [[Bruce Catton]], [[Shelby Foote]], [[David McCullough]], [[Daniel Boorstin]] and [[Barbara Tuchman]].

Recent examples of British popular historians who are also academics include [[Niall Ferguson]], [[Christopher Hibbert]] and [[Simon Schama]], and – from a previous generation – [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[A. J. P. Taylor]] (an early pioneer of history on television) and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]]. Much of [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]'s output was also directed at a popular audience.

[[John Julius Norwich]], [[Nirad Chaudhuri]], [[Ramchandra Guha]], [[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]] and [[Tariq Ali]] are popular historians who have never been academics.

{{refimprove|date=June 2008}}
A '''reaction engine''' is an [[engine|engine or motor]] that produces [[thrust]] by expelling [[reaction mass]], in accordance with [[Newton's third law of motion]]. This law of motion is most commonly paraphrased as: "For every action force there is an equal, but opposite, reaction force."

Examples include [[jet engine]]s, [[rocket engine]]s, and more uncommon variations such as [[Hall effect thruster]]s, [[ion drive]]s, [[mass drivers]], and [[nuclear pulse propulsion]].

==Energy use==

===Propulsive efficiency===
{{main|propulsive efficiency}}
For all reaction engines that carry on-board propellant (such as [[rocket engine]]s and [[electric propulsion]] drives) some energy must go into accelerating the reaction mass. Every engine wastes some energy, but even assuming 100% efficiency, the engine needs energy amounting to

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} MV_e^2&lt;/math&gt;

(where M is the mass of propellent expended and &lt;math&gt;V_e&lt;/math&gt; is the exhaust velocity), which is simply the energy to accelerate the exhaust.

[[Image:Propulsive efficiency.png|thumb|right|Due to energy carried away in the exhaust the energy efficiency of a reaction engine varies with the speed of the exhaust relative to the speed of the vehicle, this is called [[propulsive efficiency]], blue is the curve for rocket-like reaction engines, red is for air-breathing (duct) reaction engines]]
Comparing the rocket equation (which shows how much energy ends up in the final vehicle) and the above equation (which shows the total energy required) shows that even with 100% engine efficiency, certainly not all energy supplied ends up in the vehicle - some of it, indeed usually most of it, ends up as kinetic energy of the exhaust.

If the [[specific impulse]] (&lt;math&gt;I_{sp}&lt;/math&gt;) is fixed, for a mission delta-v, there is a particular &lt;math&gt;I_{sp}&lt;/math&gt; that minimises the overall energy used by the rocket. This comes to an exhaust velocity of about ⅔ of the mission delta-v (see [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation#Energy|the energy computed from the rocket equation]]). Drives with a specific impulse that is both high and fixed such as Ion thrusters have exhaust velocities that can be enormously higher than this ideal, and thus end up powersource limited and give very low thrust. Where the vehicle performance is power limited, e.g. if [[solar energy|solar power]] or nuclear power is used, then in the case of a large &lt;math&gt;v_{e}&lt;/math&gt; the maximum acceleration is inversely proportional to it. Hence the time to reach a required delta-v is proportional to &lt;math&gt;v_{e}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the latter should not be too large.

On the other hand, if the exhaust velocity can be made to vary so that at each instant it is equal and opposite to the vehicle velocity then the absolute minimum energy usage is achieved. When this is achieved, the exhaust stops in space {{note|frames||}} and has no kinetic energy; and the propulsive efficiency is 100% all the energy ends up in the vehicle (in principle such a drive would be 100% efficient, in practice there would be thermal losses from within the drive system and residual heat in the exhaust). However, in most cases this uses an impractical quantity of propellant, but is a useful theoretical consideration.

Some drives (such as [[Variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rocket|VASIMR]] or [[electrodeless plasma thruster]]) actually can significantly vary their exhaust velocity. This can help reduce propellant usage and improve acceleration at different stages of the flight. However the best energetic performance and acceleration is still obtained when the exhaust velocity is close to the vehicle speed. Proposed ion and plasma drives usually have exhaust velocities enormously higher than that ideal (in the case of VASIMR the lowest quoted speed is around 15&amp;nbsp;km/s compared to a mission delta-v from high Earth orbit to Mars of about [[Delta-v#Delta-vs around the Solar System|4&amp;nbsp;km/s]]).

For a mission, for example, when launching from or landing on a planet, the effects of gravitational attraction and any atmospheric drag must be overcome by using fuel. It is typical to combine the effects of these and other effects into an effective mission [[delta-v]]. For example, a launch mission to low Earth orbit requires about 9.3–10&amp;nbsp;km/s delta-v. These mission delta-vs are typically numerically integrated on a computer.

===Cycle efficiency===
All reaction engines lose some energy, mostly as heat.

Different reaction engines have different efficiencies and losses. For example, rocket engines can be up to 60-70% energy efficient in terms of accelerating the propellant. The rest is lost as heat and thermal radiation, primarily in the exhaust.

===Oberth effect===
{{main|Oberth effect}}
Reaction engines are more energy efficient when they emit their reaction mass when the vehicle is travelling at high speed.

This is because the useful mechanical energy generated is simply force times distance, and when a thrust force is generated while the vehicle moves, then:

:&lt;math&gt;E = F \times d \;&lt;/math&gt;

where F is the force and d is the distance moved.

Dividing by length of time of motion we get:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac E t = P =  \frac {F \times d} t = F \times v&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

:&lt;math&gt; P = F \times v \;&lt;/math&gt;

where P is the useful power and v is the speed.

Hence, v should be as high as possible, and a stationary engine does no useful work.&lt;ref group=NB&gt;Note, that might seem to suggest that a stationary engine would not start to move. However, at low speeds the amount of energy needed to start to move tends to zero faster than the power does. So in practice it does move, as you would expect.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between '''religion and schizophrenia''' is of particular interest to [[psychiatrists]] because of the similarities between [[religious experience]]s and [[psychosis|psychotic episodes]]; religious experiences often involve [[auditory hallucination|auditory]] and/or [[visual hallucination]]s, and those with schizophrenia commonly report similar hallucinations, along with a variety of beliefs that are commonly recognized by modern medical practitioners  as delusional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Murray, ED. | author2=Cunningham MG | author3=Price BH | title=The role of psychotic disorders in religious history considered | journal=J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neuroscience | volume=24 | issue=4 | pages=410–26 | doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214 | pmid=23224447| year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, religion has been found to have "both a protective and a risk increasing effect" for schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;Gearing, Robin Edward, Dana Alonzo, Alex Smolak, Katie McHugh, Sherelle Harmon, and Susanna Baldwin. "Association of religion with delusions and hallucinations in the context of schizophrenia: Implications for engagement and adherence." ''Schizophrenia research'' 126, no. 1 (2011): 150-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

A common report from those with schizophrenia is some type of religious belief that many medical practitioners consider to be delusional - such as the belief they are divine beings or prophets, that [[God]] is talking to them, they are possessed by demons, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siddle|first=Ronald |author2=Haddock, Gillian |author3=Tarrier, Nicholas |author4=Faragher, E.

Quality of Life Research 20.7 (2011): 1053-1060.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of patients with schizophrenia that had been previously admitted to a hospital, 24% had what the medical field refers to as religious delusions.

Trans-cultural studies have found that such religious beliefs, which often may not be associated with reality, are much more common in patients with schizophrenia who identify as Christian and/or reside in predominately Christian areas such as Europe or North America.&lt;ref name="Tateyama"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tateyama M, Asai M, Hashimoto M, Bartels M, Kasper S |title=Transcultural study of schizophrenic delusions.

==Background==
{{Main|Schizophrenia}}
Schizophrenia is a complex [[Psychosis|psychotic disorder]] in which symptoms include emotional blunting, intellectual deterioration, social isolation, disorganized speech and behavior, delusions, and hallucinations. The causes of schizophrenia are unclear, but it seems that [[heredity|genetics]] play a heavy role, as individuals with a family history are far more likely to suffer from schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="van Os 635–45"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Os|first=J|author2=Kapur, S |title=Schizophrenia.|journal=Lancet|date=2009-08-22|volume=374|issue=9690|pages=635–45|pmid=19700006|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60995-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Picchioni|first=MM|author2=Murray, RM |title=Schizophrenia.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=2007-07-14|volume=335|issue=7610|pages=91–5|pmid=17626963|doi=10.1136/bmj.39227.616447.BE|pmc=1914490}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The disorder can be triggered and exacerbated by social and environmental factors, with episodes becoming more apparent in periods of high [[stress (psychological)|stress]]. Neurologists have found that the schizophrenic brain has larger ventricles (fluid-filled cavities) compared to a well brain. This is hypothesized to be due to loss of nerve cells.&lt;ref name="UCLA Newsroom"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Page|first1=Dan|title=UCLA Researchers Map How Schizophrenia Engulfs Teen Brains|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/UCLA-Researchers-Map-How-Schizophrenia-2701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms usually appear around the onset of early adulthood.&lt;ref name="van Os 635–45"/&gt;  It is rare for a child to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, in part because of the difficulty in establishing what erroneous thoughts and beliefs can be attributed to childhood development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLeod|first1=Saul|title=Egocentrism|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/preoperational.html|website=simplepsychology.org|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which thoughts and beliefs can be attributed to schizophrenia. With [[psychiatric medication]] (usually [[antipsychotic]]s) and therapy, individuals with schizophrenia can live successful and productive lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://psychcentral.com/lib/atypical-antipsychotics-for-schizophrenia/|title=Grohol, John M., Dr. "Atypical Antipsychotics for Schizophrenia."

== Role of religion in schizophrenia treatment ==

It has been shown in longitudinal studies that those suffering from schizophrenia have varying degrees of success when religion plays a significant role in their recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohr|first=S.|title=Toward an Integration of Spirituality and Religiousness Into the Psychosocial Dimension of Schizophrenia|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|date=1 November 2006|volume=163|issue=11|pages=1952–1959|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.11.1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It would seem that the use of religion can either be a helpful method of coping with the disorder, or it can be a significant hindrance in recovery. Especially for those who are active in a [[religious community]], religion can also be a very valuable tool in coping with the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danbolt|first=Lars J.|title=The Personal Significance of Religiousness and Spirituality in Patients With Schizophrenia|journal=International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|date=31 March 2011|volume=21|issue=2|pages=145–158|doi=10.1080/10508619.2011.557009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helman|first=DS|title=Recovery from schizophrenia: An autoethnography|journal=Deviant Behavior|date=2018|volume=39|issue=3|pages=380–399|doi=10.1080/01639625.2017.1286174}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can be difficult, however, to distinguish if a religious experience is genuine to the spiritual person, or if it is a positive symptom of the illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koenig|first=Harold G.|title=Religion, spirituality and psychotic disorders|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0101-60832007000700013&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal=Archives of Clinical Psychiatry (São Paulo)|volume=34|pages=95–104|doi=10.1590/S0101-60832007000700013|issn=0101-6083|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is where a skilled and reliable therapist can help. Provided that a [[mental health professional|therapist]] is open to the use of religion in one's treatment, and that the patient is open and receiving said treatment, it is entirely possible to tie religion in with professional therapeutic aids and [[medication]] in order to meet a desirable goal. Those who are involved in their church and are spiritual on a daily basis, while getting psychiatric treatment have reported fewer symptoms and a better quality of life. They learn to see their religion as a source of hope rather than a tormenting reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohr|first=S|author2=Huguelet P |title=The relationship between schizophrenia and religion and its implications for care|journal=Swiss Medical Weekly|url=http://www.smw.ch/docs/pdf200x/2004/25/smw-10322.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion as a trigger for schizophrenia ==
{{POV|date=April 2017}}
Schizophrenia can be triggered by a variety of environmental factors, including significant stress, intensely emotional situations, and disturbing or uncomfortable experiences. It is possible that religion itself may be a trigger for schizophrenia; religious imagery is often very grandiose, and defies commonly held beliefs of what is realistic and natural in the world. Experiencing an intense religious experience may trigger a psychotic episode in those who are vulnerable to them, because religion often requires a believer to suspend their usual idea of what is possible and impossible. This could potentially lead to a psychotic episode due to the shift in realistic thinking; a sufferer may believe that they themselves are [[Deity|religious deities]] or [[Messiah]]s, or that God himself is speaking to the individual. These symptoms may cause violent behavior, either on others or themselves because of taking passages in religious texts literally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.117.217&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=The relationship between schizophrenia and religion and its implications for care|first1=Sylvia|last1=Mohr|first2=Philippe|last2=Huguelet|journal=Swiss Med Weekly|year=2004|volume=134|pp=369–376|via=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, they may also experience more distress-inducing symptoms if they believe that God is using their illness as a punishment. Religion, depending on how the patient views it, can be paralyzing and quite harmful, in that the patient may refuse treatment based on religious beliefs; in certain instances, one might believe that their delusions and hallucinations are actually a divine experience, and therefore deny any treatment.  It has been shown that those with schizophrenia who suffer from religious delusions are more religious than those who do not suffer from these delusions.&lt;ref name="Mohr 1095–1103"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohr|first=Sylvia |author2=Borras, Laurence |author3=Rieben, Isabelle |author4=Betrisey, Carine |author5=Gillieron, Christiane |author6=Brandt, Pierre-Yves |author7=Perroud, Nader |author8=Huguelet, Philippe|title=Evolution of spirituality and religiousness in chronic schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorders: a 3-years follow-up study|journal=Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology|date=11 October 2009|volume=45|issue=11|pages=1095–1103|doi=10.1007/s00127-009-0151-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been shown that those who suffer from religious delusions are less likely to continue long-term treatment.

In the domain of [[systems engineering]], '''Specialty Engineering''' is defined as and includes the engineering disciplines that are not typical of the main engineering effort.  More common engineering efforts in systems engineering such as [[Electronic hardware|hardware]], [[software]], and human factors engineering may be used as major elements in a majority of systems engineering efforts and therefore are not viewed as "special".  

Examples of specialty engineering include [[electromagnetic interference]], safety, and physical security.&lt;ref&gt;Eisner, Howard. (2002). "Essentials of Project and Systems Engineering Management". Wiley. p.217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less common engineering domains such as electromagnetic interference, [[electrical grounding]], safety, security, electrical power filtering/uninterruptible supply, manufacturability, and environmental engineering may be included in systems engineering efforts where they have been identified to address special system implementations. These less common but just as important engineering efforts are then viewed as "specialty engineering".

However, if the specific system has a standard implementation of environmental or security for example, the situation is reversed and the human factors engineering or hardware/software engineering may be the "specialty engineering" domain. 

The key take away is; the context of the system engineering project and unique needs of the project are fundamental when thinking of what are the specialty engineering efforts.  

The benefit of citing "specialty engineering" in planning is the notice to all team levels that special management and science factors may need to be accounted for and may influence the project.

Specialty engineering may be cited by commercial entities and others to specify their unique abilities.

[[File:Fern-frond-sori.jpg|thumb|right|The sporophyll of a fern. It is a fertile leaf bearing reproductive structures.]]
A '''sporophyll''' is a [[leaf]] that bears [[sporangia]]. Both microphylls and megaphylls can be sporophylls. In heterosporous plants, sporophylls (whether they are microphylls or megaphylls) bear either megasporangia and thus are called '''megasporophylls''', or microsporangia and are called '''microsporophylls'''. The overlap of the prefixes and roots makes these terms a particularly confusing subset of botanical nomenclature.

Sporophylls vary greatly in appearance and structure, and may or may not look similar to sterile leaves. Plants that produce sporophylls include:

''[[Alaria esculenta]]'' a brown alga shows sporophylls attached near the base of the alga.&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, Carola I. 1963. ''British Seaweeds''. The Kew Series.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lycophyte]]s, where sporophylls may be aggregated into [[strobilus|strobili]] (''Selaginella'' and some ''Lycopodium'' and related genera) or distributed singly among sterile leaves (''[[Huperzia]]''). Sporangia are borne in the axil or on the adaxial surface of the sporophyll. In heterosporous members, megasporophylls and microsporophylls may be intermixed or separated in a variety of patterns.

[[Fern]]s, which may produce sporophylls that are similar to sterile fronds or that appear very different from sterile fronds. These may be non-photosynthetic and lack typical pinnae (e.g. ''Onoclea'')

[[Cycad]]s produce strobili, both pollen-producing and seed-producing, that are composed of sporophylls. 

''[[Ginkgo]]'' produces microsporophylls aggregated into a pollen strobilus. Ovules are not born on sporophylls {{Citation needed|reason=the structure that carries the seed and arillus of Ginko can and has been interpreted as a leave (This means that Ovules are in Ginko born on megasphorophylls), why should this be wrong now?|date=October 2017}}.

Conifers, like ''Ginkgo'' and cycads, produce microsporophylls, aggregated into pollen strobili. However, unlike these other groups, ovules are produced on cone scales, which are modified shoots rather than sporophylls.

Some plants do not produce sporophylls. Sporangia are produced directly on stems. ''Psilotum'' has been interpreted as producing sporangia (fused in a synangium) on the terminus of a stem. ''[[Equisetum]]'' always produce strobili, but the structures bearing sporangia (sporangiophores) have been interpreted as [[Aerial stem modification|modified stems]]. The sporangia, despite being recurved are interpreted as terminal. 

[[Gnetophyte]]s produce both compound pollen and seed strobili.

'''[[Aberration of light|Stellar aberration]]''' is an astronomical phenomenon "which produces an apparent motion of celestial objects". It can be proven mathematically that stellar aberration is due to the change of the astronomer's [[inertial frame of reference]]. The formula is derived with the use of [[Special relativity#Reference frames.2C coordinates and the Lorentz transformation|Lorentz transformation]] of the star's ''coordinates''.

As the astronomer [[John Herschel]] has already explained in 1844, the stellar aberration does '''not''' depend on the relative velocity of the star towards Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Herschel, John Frederick William|title=Schreiben des Herrn Baronets Herschel an den Herausgeber|journal=Astronomische Nachrichten|volume=22|issue=520|date=1844|pages=249–254|bibcode = 1844AN.....22..249H |doi = 10.1002/asna.18450221702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise [[Binary star#Eclipsing binaries|eclipsing binary stars]] would appear to be separated, in stark contrast to observation: both stars are rotating with high speed —and ever changing and different velocity vectors— around each other, but they appear as ''one'' spot all the time.

==Stellar aberration is only due to the change of the astronomer's inertial frame of reference==

In the year 1926 the astrophysicist [[Robert Emden]] published the article ''Aberration und Relativitätstheorie'' in the journal ''[[Naturwissenschaften]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Emden, R.|title=Aberration und Relativitätstheorie|journal=Die Naturwissenschaften|volume=14|issue=16|date=1926|pages=329–335|doi=10.1007/BF01506966|bibcode = 1926NW.....14..329E }} (14. Jahrgang, Heft 16)&lt;/ref&gt; In this article he states that the direction of a light ray isn't influenced by the motion of the star or by the motion of Earth.&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;R. Emden's (rhetorical) question "How will the direction of the light rays of stars incident upon Earth be influenced by the motion of Earth and the motion (not the location) of the star at the time of emission?" is answered by him with "Not at all."&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the opponents of the special theory of relativity reasoned that the theory must be flawed, because it would state that the stellar aberration would depend on the relative velocity of the star — which would be in contradiction to observation — and R. Emden's article explains that the special theory of relativity does not predict this. Today, the special theory of relativity isn't contested anymore but there are still articles that suggest that the aberration would depend on the relative velocity of the star.&lt;ref&gt;See for example equation (4) in {{cite journal |arxiv=astro-ph/0203056 |title=Why the Bradley aberration cannot be used to measure absolute speeds. A comment |author1=Klaus Kassner |date=2002 |doi=10.1209/epl/i2002-00443-7 |volume=58 |issue=4 |journal=Europhysics Letters (EPL) |pages=637–638|bibcode=2002EL.....58..637K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a (relativistic) [[velocity-addition formula]] can be used to explain stellar aberration, (see [[Aberration of light#Explanation|Aberration of light]]), another  (relativistic) explanation using only the [[Lorentz transformation]] is also possible, as will be demonstrated. This derivation only uses the star's ''coordinates'' at the time of emission, and therefore has the ''formal'' advantage there is no place for the relative velocity of the star towards the astronomer and therefore it is evident that the observed position doesn't depend on the star's velocity — provided that the resultant change of position is much smaller than the distance between star and Earth.&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;I.e. the stars can rotate very fast like eclipsing binary stars as long as the change in position is much smaller than the star-earth distance.&lt;/ref&gt; The observed position of the star wouldn't depend on Earth's motion either, if the astronomer could use the same inertial frame of reference all the time. But of course that is technically impossible,&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;It's easy to (technically) compensate the deviation of the ''direction'' of the axes due to Earth's rotation and earth's orbit but it almost impossible to (technically) compensate a velocity in the order of several 1000&amp;nbsp;m/s. This can only be achieved with help of mathematics.&lt;/ref&gt; the astronomer uses his current rest frame and these current rest frames are different at different times as Earth orbits around the Sun. It is mathematically convenient to declare the position of the source star in the rest frame of the Sun (more exactly: the center of mass of the Solar System) as the "real" position and that the difference to this "real" position derives form the "aberration".&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;Of course every inertial frame of reference is physically equal, but the rest system of the barycenter has the mathematical advantage, that it's the ''mean'' frame of reference and since the time of [[Galileo Galilei]] it's the preferred frame of reference&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sample calculation===
[[File:PathLightSignalS.PNG|thumb|left|path of light signal in reference frame S]]
[[File:PathLightSignalSdash.PNG|thumb|path of light signal in reference frame S']]
S and S' are (quasi-)inertial frames of reference and the reference frame S' is in uniform motion with v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5c relative to S, such that in the future the star comes nearer to the origin of the coordinate system (and consequently further afar in the past). The x-,y- and z-axes of both systems ought to be parallel and at time t=t'=0 the origins of both systems ought to coincide. 
Therefore one gets according to Lorentz transformation: &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \beta=v/c &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \gamma=1/\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;:  y'=y ; z=z';  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x'=\gamma\cdot(x-\beta\cdot ct)&lt;/math&gt;
 
Suppose now that the star emitted a light signal at time &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle c\,t_1=-5\,Ly&lt;/math&gt; at location &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x_1=4\,Ly\;,\;y_1= 3\,Ly\;,\;z_1=0 &lt;/math&gt; (S coordinates) and that this light signal is received by an astronomer at time  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle c\,t_2=0&lt;/math&gt; at location &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x_2=0\;,\;y_2=0\;,\;z_2=0&lt;/math&gt;.

In S the star's position and the x-axis form an angle &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \tan \delta =3/4 \; \rightarrow \;\delta =36.87^\circ &lt;/math&gt;
But in S' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x_1'=\gamma \cdot (x_1-\beta \cdot c\,t_1)=1,1547\cdot (4 Lj - 0,5\cdot(-5 Lj))=7,50555 Lj; \quad y_1'=y_1=3 Lj&lt;/math&gt; and therefore the angle &lt;math&gt;\delta'&lt;/math&gt; between the star's position and x'-axis&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;The lines of x-axis and x'-axis lie on top of each other&lt;/ref&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \tan \delta'=y_1'/x_1'=3/7,50555\;\rightarrow\;\delta' = 21,79^\circ&lt;/math&gt;
 
Calculation with help of the formula in [[aberration of light#Explanation]] gives the same result: &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \tan (\delta'/2) = \tan (\delta /2) \cdot \sqrt {(1-0,5)/(1+0,5)} = \tan (36,87^\circ/2) \cdot \sqrt{1/3} = 0,19245\;&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\;\rightarrow\;\delta'/2= 10,89^\circ\;\rightarrow\;\delta'=21,79^\circ&lt;/math&gt;.

==Two-dimensional problem==

===Derivation of the formula for motion along the x-axis===

For the derivation it is assumed, that the light signal only travels through space regions where the gravitation field is negligible. Hence is suffices to use [[special relativity|'''special''' relativity]] and the path of the light signal is a straight line in any inertial frame of reference.

'''Observation in the [[rest frame]] S of the [[center of mass#Astronomy|center of mass]] of  our Solar System'''

''The rest frame of the center of mass (barycenter) is a very good&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;An even better quasi-inertial frame of reference would be a frame of reference in which the center of mass of the Milky Way would rest or be in uniform motion.&lt;/ref&gt; quasi-inertial frame of reference for periods of time in the order of thousands of years, since our solar system needs about 230 million years ([[galactic year]]) to move completely around the center of the [[Milky Way]]. The space coordinates of this frame of reference form a [[Cartesian coordinate system]].''

In the reference frame S &lt;math&gt;(x_1|y_1|0|c\,t_1)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;c\,t_1&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_1|y_1) \ne (0|0)&lt;/math&gt; are the (space-time) coordinates at which the star emits a light signal and &lt;math&gt;(0|0|0|0)&lt;/math&gt; are the coordinates at which the astronomer receives the light signal.

In reference frame S the light signal starts at &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; and stops at time &lt;math&gt;t_2=0&lt;/math&gt; and therefore the light signal did cover the distance &lt;math&gt;d = c\cdot(0-t_1) = -c\,t_1&lt;/math&gt; .

In S the path of the light signal is a straight line and it forms an angle &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; with the x-axis with: &lt;math&gt;\sin \delta = \frac{y_1}{d}=\frac{y_1}{-c\,t_1}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; and &lt;math&gt;\cos\delta=\frac{x_1}{-c\,t_1}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Observation in the inertial frame of reference S' which is in uniform motion (relative to S) along the x-axis'''
  
The origin of the reference frame S' is in uniform motion relative to S with &lt;math&gt;(v|0|0)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. moves along the x-axis, and the x-,y- und z-axes of S' and S are parallel to each other and at time &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle t=t'=0&lt;/math&gt; the origins of S and S' coincide. Let &lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{v}{c} , \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

S' now is an equally good quasi-inertial frame of reference as S: the space coordinates form a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] and the path of the light signal is a straight line.
 
According to the Lorentz transformation one gets:  &lt;math&gt; x_1' = \gamma \cdot(x_1-\beta \cdot c\,t_1) , y_1'=y_1 , z_1'=0 , c\,t_1' = \gamma \cdot (c\,t_1-\beta \cdot x_1)&lt;/math&gt;

In reference frame S' the light signal starts at &lt;math&gt;t_1'&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; and stops at time &lt;math&gt;t_2'=0&lt;/math&gt; and therefore the light signal did cover the distance &lt;math&gt;d\,' = c\cdot(0-t_1') = -c\,t_1'&lt;/math&gt; .

In S' the path of the light signal is a straight line, too. It forms an angle &lt;math&gt;\delta'&lt;/math&gt; with the x'-axis and one gets:

&lt;math&gt; \sin \delta' = \frac{y_1'}{d\,'}=\frac{y_1}{-c\,t_1'}
=\frac{y_1}{-\gamma \cdot (c\,t_1-\beta \cdot x_1)}
=\frac{y_1}{-c\,t_1 \cdot \gamma\cdot \left(1-\beta\cdot\frac{x_1}{c\,t_1}\right)}=\frac{\frac{y_1}{-c\,t_1}}{\gamma\cdot\left(1+\beta\cdot\frac{x_1}{-c\,t_1}\right)}
=\frac{\sin \delta}{\gamma\cdot(1+\beta\cdot\cos\delta)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\cos\delta'=\frac{x_1'}{-c\,t_1'}
=\frac{\gamma \cdot(x_1-\beta \cdot c\,t_1)}{-\gamma \cdot (c\,t_1-\beta \cdot x_1)}
=\frac{-c\,t_1 \cdot \gamma \cdot \left ( \frac{x_1}{-c\,t_1}+\beta \right)}{-c\,t_1 \cdot \gamma \cdot \left( 1 + \beta \cdot \frac{x_1}{-c\, t_1} \right) }
=\frac{\frac{x_1}{-c\,t_1}+\beta}{1 + \beta \cdot \frac{x_1}{-c\, t_1}}
=\frac{\cos \delta +\beta}{1 + \beta \cdot \cos \delta}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence: &lt;math&gt;\tan \delta' = \frac{\sin \delta'}{\cos \delta'}=\frac{\sin \delta}{\gamma\cdot(\cos \delta +\beta)}&lt;/math&gt;

These are the same formulas as in [[aberration of light#Explanation]].

===Approximate formula for motion along the x-axis in case of v/c &lt;&lt;1===

&lt;math&gt;\triangle\delta\;=\;\delta' - \delta\; &lt;/math&gt; is the change of the angle &amp;delta;. As &amp;beta;&lt;&lt;1 this change is also very small.

'''Case I: '''&lt;math&gt;\;\delta\ne\pm 90^\circ\; \rightarrow \;\cos \delta \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;

As &amp;Delta;&amp;delta;&lt;&lt;1 one gets: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\tan \delta' - \tan \delta}{\triangle\delta} \approx\frac{d}{d\delta}\tan \delta = \frac{1}{(\cos \delta)^2}\; \rightarrow \; \triangle\delta\;=\;(\cos \delta)^2 \cdot (\tan \delta' - \tan \delta)&lt;/math&gt;

As &amp;beta;&lt;&lt;1 one gets: &lt;math&gt;\tan\delta'=\frac {\sin \delta}{\gamma(\cos \delta +\beta)} \approx \frac {\sin \delta}{\cos \delta +\beta} = \frac{\sin \delta}{\cos \delta \cdot \left(1+\frac{\beta}{\cos \delta}\right)} \approx \tan \delta \cdot \left(1-\frac{\beta}{\cos \delta}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore &lt;math&gt;\triangle\delta\;=\;(\cos \delta)^2 \cdot (\tan \delta' - \tan \delta) = (\cos \delta)^2 \cdot \tan \delta \left(1-\frac{\beta}{\cos \delta}\;-1\right) = - \cos \delta \cdot \tan \delta \cdot \beta = -\beta \cdot \sin \delta &lt;/math&gt;

'''Case IIa: '''&lt;math&gt;\;\delta\;=90^\circ\;&lt;/math&gt;, hence: &lt;math&gt;\tan \delta' =\frac{\sin 90^\circ}{\gamma\cdot(\cos 90^\circ + \beta)}= \frac{1}{\gamma \cdot \beta}\;\approx \frac {1}{\beta} \quad \rightarrow \quad \cot \delta' = \beta \quad \rightarrow \quad \delta' = \arccot \beta \approx \frac{\pi}{2} - \beta &lt;/math&gt;

and therefore: &lt;math&gt;\triangle\delta = \delta' - \delta = -\beta \quad \left(= -\beta \cdot \sin(90^\circ)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Case IIb: '''&lt;math&gt;\;\delta\;=-90^\circ\;&lt;/math&gt;, and hence: &lt;math&gt;\tan \delta' = \frac{-1}{\gamma \cdot \beta}\;\approx -\frac {1}{\beta} \quad \rightarrow \quad \cot \delta' = -\beta \quad \rightarrow \quad \delta' = \arccot \beta \approx -\frac{\pi}{2} + \beta \quad&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;Here the solution with cot 0 = -&amp;pi;/2 has to be used, see [https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.efunda.com/math/trig_functions/images/arccot_plot.gif&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.efunda.com/math/trig_functions/display.cfm?name%3Darccot&amp;h=329&amp;w=485&amp;sz=3&amp;tbnid=a0hRF-qzOibryM:&amp;tbnh=82&amp;tbnw=121&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__rTZwdunutqIAiG-l4WbgNeG82pY=&amp;docid=KYfggGmcAxqigM&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z52XUZTAK6nk4QSDxIEQ&amp;ved=0CEMQ9QEwAw&amp;dur=197 Plot of arccot (x)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence: &lt;math&gt;\triangle\delta = \delta' - \delta = +\beta\quad \left(= -\beta \cdot \sin(-90^\circ)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Conclusion:'''The change of the angle &amp;Delta;&amp;delta; = &amp;delta;'-&amp;delta;  in the case of &amp;beta; = v/c &lt;&lt; 1 can be described by the approximate formula &lt;math&gt;\triangle\delta = -\frac{v}{c} \cdot \sin \delta\;&lt;/math&gt; resp. in the degree measure &lt;math&gt;\triangle\delta = -\frac{v}{c} \cdot \sin \delta  \cdot \frac{180^\circ}{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;

===Symmetric form of the (exact) formula for motion along the x-axis===

With help of [[tangent half-angle formula]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \tan (\alpha/2)=\sin\alpha/(1+\cos\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; one can prove the symmetric form: &lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{\delta'}{2}=\sqrt{\frac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}\cdot\tan\frac{\delta}{2}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;  (derivation found in a SR-textbook&lt;ref&gt;''Spezielle Relativitätstheorie für Studienanfänger'', Jürgen Freund, vdf-Verlag (Zürich), 2nd. Ed. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;)

&lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{\delta'}{2}=\frac{\sin \delta'}{1+\cos \delta'}
=\frac{\frac{\sin \delta}{\gamma\cdot(1+\beta\cdot\cos\delta)}}{\frac{1 + \beta \cdot \cos \delta}{1 + \beta \cdot \cos \delta}+\frac{\cos \delta +\beta}{1 + \beta \cdot \cos \delta}}
=\frac{\sin \delta}{\gamma\cdot(1 + \beta \cdot \cos \delta + \cos \delta +\beta)}=\frac{\sin \delta}{\gamma\cdot(1 + \beta)\cdot(1+ \cos \delta)}
=\frac{\tan \frac{\delta}{2}}{\gamma\cdot(1+ \beta)}&lt;/math&gt;

And as &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\gamma\cdot(1+\beta)}
=\frac{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}{1+\beta}
=\frac{\sqrt{(1+\beta)(1-\beta)}}{1+\beta}
=\sqrt{\frac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}&lt;/math&gt; the symmetric form follows.

===Formula for motion along the y-axis===

Let &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;/math&gt; be the angle between the light ray (=path of the light signal which is a straight line) and the y-axis whereby &amp;theta; is positive if the y-axis would have to rotate counter-clockwise to coincide with the light ray. Then the derivation of the formula of angle &amp;theta;' for the motion along the y-axis is the same as the derivation of the formula of angle &amp;delta;' for the motion along the x-axis.

Hence: &lt;math&gt;\tan\theta\,' = \frac{\sin\theta}{\gamma\cdot(\cos\theta+\beta)}&lt;/math&gt;

The symmetric form is: &lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{\theta\,'}{2}=\sqrt{\frac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}\cdot\tan\frac{\theta}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and the approximate formula is: &lt;math&gt;\triangle\theta = -\beta\cdot\sin\theta&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;\theta=\delta-90^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sin(\delta-90^{\circ})=-\sin(90^\circ-\delta)=-\cos\delta\;,\;\cos(\delta-90^\circ)=\cos(90^\circ-\delta)=\sin\delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\tan(\delta-90^\circ)=-\tan(90^\circ-\delta)=-\cot\delta&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; one gets:

&lt;math&gt;\tan(\delta'-90^\circ) = \frac{\sin(\delta-90^\circ)}{\gamma\cdot\left(\cos(\delta - 90 ^\circ)+\beta\right)}&lt;/math&gt; and therefore:&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;-\cot\delta' = \frac{-\cos\delta}{\gamma\cdot(\sin\delta+\beta)}&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;\cot\delta' = \frac{\cos\delta}{\gamma\cdot(\sin\delta+\beta)}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\cot\delta'=\frac{1}{\tan\delta'}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; one also gets: &lt;math&gt;\tan\delta' = \frac{\gamma\cdot(\sin\delta+\beta)}{\cos\delta}&lt;/math&gt;

And the symmetric form is: &lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{\delta'-90^\circ}{2}=\sqrt{\frac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}\cdot\tan\frac{\delta-90^\circ}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

And as  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\triangle\theta=(\delta'-90^\circ)-(\delta-90^\circ)=\triangle\delta&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; the approximate formula is: &lt;math&gt;\triangle\delta = \triangle\theta =-\beta\cdot\sin(\delta-90^\circ)=+\beta\cdot\cos\delta&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

===Formula for motion along a ray lying in the x-y-plane with direction vector (cos &amp;alpha; | sin &amp;alpha;) ===

With the same reasoning as above one gets the formula: &lt;math&gt;\tan(\delta'-\alpha) = \frac{\sin(\delta-\alpha)}{\gamma\cdot\left(\cos(\delta-\alpha)+\beta\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

The symmetric form is: &lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{\delta'-\alpha}{2}=\sqrt{\frac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}\cdot\tan\frac{\delta-\alpha}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

The approximate formula is: &lt;math&gt;\triangle\delta = - \beta\cdot\sin(\delta-\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; and in the degree measure: &lt;math&gt;\triangle\delta = -\frac{v}{c}\cdot\sin(\delta-\alpha)\cdot\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;

==Application: Aberration in astronomy==

The stellar aberration is purely an effect of the change of the reference frame. The astronomer orbits (with Earth) around the Sun and furthermore rotates around the axis of Earth. His current rest frame S' therefore has different velocities relative to the rest frame S of the barycenter of the Solar System at different times. Hence the astronomer observes that the position of the star changes. The formula is derived under the condition that the change of the ''position'' of the star and of Earth is negligible in the period of observation.&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;For the star this period lies in the past.&lt;/ref&gt; That is correct for almost all stars: the amplitude of the [[parallax]] of a star, for a distance of ≥ n [[parsec]], is ≤ 1/n&amp;#x202F;".

===Stellar aberration due to the orbit of Earth (around the Sun)===

The mean orbital speed of Earth is &lt;math&gt;v_e = \frac{2 \cdot \pi \cdot 1\,AE}{365,25\,d} = 29,78\,km/s &lt;/math&gt;, and therefore &lt;math&gt;\frac{v_e}{c} = 0,00009935&lt;/math&gt;.

-&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{v}{c} \cdot \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = 20,5^{\prime\prime}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt; k_A= 20,5^{\prime\prime}&lt;/math&gt; is dubbed ''constant of aberration'' for the annual aberration.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1964SvA.....7..737M The Constant of Aberration and the Solar Parallax]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stellar aberration due to Earth's rotation===

An astronomer at the [[latitude]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; rotates in 24 hours around the axis of Earth. His speed of rotation is therefore &lt;math&gt;v_r= \frac{\cos \varphi \cdot 40000\,km}{1\,d} = \cos \varphi \cdot 463\,m/s&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;\frac{v_r}{c} = \cos \varphi \cdot 1,54\cdot10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt;. Form this so called ''diurnal'' aberration one gets an additional contribution of (at max.) &lt;math&gt; \cos \varphi \cdot 0,32^{\prime\prime}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Stellar aberration due the orbit of our solar system around the center of the Milky Way===

The rest frame of the center of mass of our solar system isn't a perfect inertial frame of reference since our solar system orbits around the center of the [[Milky Way]]. An estimation for the time of period of circulation is 230 million years (estimations vary between 225 and 250 million years).&lt;ref&gt;see [http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/StacyLeong.shtml hypertextbook.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question18.html NASA - StarChild Question of the Month for February 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; As the estimation for the distance between our solar system and the center of the Milky Way is about 28000 [[Light-year|Ly]], the assumed [[orbital speed]] of our solar system is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v = \frac{2\pi \cdot 280000 \cdot 9,461\cdot10^{15}\,m}{230\cdot 10^{6} \cdot 365,25 \cdot 24 \cdot 3600} \approx\, 230\,km/s&lt;/math&gt;. This would cause an aberration ellipse with a major semiaxis of 2,6' ([[minute of arc|arcminutes]]). Therefore, in one year the aberration angle could change (at max.)  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 2,6^\prime \cdot \frac{2 \pi \cdot 1\,a}{230000000\,a}&lt;/math&gt; = 4,3 µas ([[minute of arc|microarcseconds]]). This very small value isn't detectable now, perhaps it's possible with the planned mission of the [[Gaia (spacecraft)|Gaia spacecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;This is a hint from H.-H. Voigt: ''Abriss der Astronomie'', 6. Auflage. Herausgegeben von H.-J. Röser und W. Tscharnuter. © 2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

In [[biblical studies]], the '''supplementary hypothesis''' proposes that the [[Pentateuch]] (the first five books of the bible) was derived from a series of direct additions to an existing corpus of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Seters|first1=John|title=The Pentateuch: A Social-Science Commentary|date=1999|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as a revision to the earlier [[documentary hypothesis]], which proposed that independent and complete narratives were later combined by redactors to create the Pentateuch.

The supplementary hypothesis was developed over the 19th and 20th centuries, primarily deriving from a dissatisfaction with the adequacy of the documentary hypothesis, and came to a head in the 1970s with the publication of works by [[John Van Seters]], [[Rolf Rendtorff]], and [[Hans Heinrich Schmid]]. In their book, ''An Introduction to the Bible'', Kugler and Hartin argue that "the work of John Van Seters best reflects the revival of the supplementary hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kugler &amp; Hartin|title=An Introduction to the Bible|date=2009|publisher=[[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.]] |location=Cambridge|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Seters’ summation of the hypothesis accepts "three sources or literary strata within the Pentateuch," which have come to be known as the [[Yahwist]] (J), the [[Priestly source|Priestly Writer]] (P), and the [[Deuteronomist]] (D). Van Seters ordered the sources chronologically as DJP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Seters|first1=John|title=The Pentateuch: A Social-Science Commentary|date=1999|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the Deuteronomist source (D) was likely written c. 700 BCE.
* the Yahwist source (J) was likely written c. 600 BCE in the [[exilic]] period.
* the Priestly source (P) was likely  written c. 400 BCE in the [[post-exilic]] period.

While the hypothesis is not the only revision of the documentary hypothesis to be made, it is one of the few at the forefront of Pentateuch studies and has been suggested by many scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aaron|first1=David H.|title=Etched in Stone: The Emergence of the Decalogue|date=2006|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==

While documentarians originally placed the authorship of the Pentateuch in the 10th to the 7th centuries BCE, the supplementary hypothesis places the authorship of the Pentateuch later in the seventh to fifth centuries. A major driver of this reassessment has been the evolving understanding of the historical context of the early Israelites. Biblical estimates put the earliest activity of the Israelites in Canaan in the 13th century, with [[Joshua]]'s conquest. However, archeologists have found no evidence of a distinct Israelite people in the region at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finkelstein &amp; Silberman|title=The Bible Unearthed|date=2001|publisher=Touchstone|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, archaeologists have found that most of the places referred to by name in the Bible, most notably [[Jerusalem]], reflect the realities of the 7th century, much later. If, as the archeological evidence would suggest, there was no distinct group of "Israelite" people until the seventh century, the authorship of the Pentateuch is likely to have occurred in the 7th century and later. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finkelstein &amp; Silberman|title=The Bible Unearthed|date=2001|publisher=Touchstone|location=New York|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archeological findings have caused recent Pentateuch scholars to reject earlier documentarian claims of 10th-century authorship, in favor of later authorship, as reflected in the supplementary hypothesis.

== Major divergences from the documentary hypothesis ==
[[Julius Wellhausen]], the leading proponent of the documentary hypothesis, proposed that the Pentateuch is the amalgamation of four independent and complete narratives which were combined by redactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horton|first1=Fred L.|title=A Basic Vocabulary of Biblical Studies for Beginning Students: A Work in Progress|date=2007|publisher=Wake Forest University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supplementary hypothesis, as outlined by Van Seters, differs from it in three major ways:

=== The existence of the Elohist (E) source ===

The supplementary hypothesis denies the existence of an extensive Elohist (E) source, one of the four independent sources described in the documentary hypothesis. Instead, it describes the Yahwist as having borrowed from an array of written and oral traditions, combining them into the J source. It proposes that because J is compiled from many earlier traditions and stories, documentarians mistook the compilation as having multiple authors: the Yahwist (J) ''and'' the Elohist (E). Instead, the supplementary hypothesis proposes that what documentarians considered J and E are in fact a single source (some use J, some use JE), likely written in the 6th century BCE.

=== The chronology of the sources ===

The supplementary hypothesis proposes that the Deuteronomist (D) was the original, and earliest, Pentateuch writer, having been written at the end of the seventh century, and ascribes the Jahwist (J) to the exilic (c. 540) and the Priestly (P) to the post-exilic (c. 400) periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aaron|first1=David H.|title=Etched in Stone: The Emergence of the Decalogue|date=2006|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The supplementary hypothesis argues that the Deuteronomist (D) source is of the seventh century BCE. Early Pentateuch scholars, most notably [[Martin Noth]], argued that the Deuteronomist (D) was a single sixth century author explaining the events preceding the Babylonian exile theologically. In 1968 [[Frank Moore Cross]] suggested that Deuteronomist (D) actually originated from "dual-redactors," with the original Deuteronomist (Dtr1) being a seventh century author supporting Josiah's reforms, and Noth's later sixth century Deuteronomist (Dtr2) revising the earlier work, imbuing it with themes of punishment for the sinful as to explain the Babylonian exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richter|first1=Sandra L.|title=The Deuteronomistic history and the name theology|date=2002|publisher=Walter de Gruyter}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "dual-redactor" view is likely the most common held among scholars today; Van Seters affirmed this view arguing that both the emphasis on seventh century reform and on sixth century exile shows that  "Deuteronomy . . . consists of an older nucleus with later expansions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Seters|first1=John|title=The Pentateuch: A Social-Science Commentary|date=1999|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the documentary hypothesis held that the Yahwist (J) was likely of the 10th century, the supplementary hypothesis puts it much later, in the 6th century, during the exilic period. That reassessment was made largely because of research conducted in the 1970s. A 1976 study by [[Hans Heinrich Schmid]] demonstrated that the Yahwist (J) was aware of earlier religious writings of the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, refuting the original assessment of J as a work of the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cambell &amp; O'Brien|title=Sources of the Pentateuch: texts, introductions, annotations.|date=1993|publisher=Frotress Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Seters argues that the Yahwist (J) used "fragments, some in literary form, others as popular motifs and stories" to create a theological creation story, expanding upon the Deuteronomist's established corpus of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Seters|first1=John|title=The Pentateuch: A Social-Science Commentary|date=1999|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the post-exilic period, he theorizes that there was an established theological work (DJ) created by the Deutoronomist (D) and Yahwist (J). 

Van Seters argues that the Priestly source (P) is not independent from the Yahwist source (J) but indeed relies heavily upon it. If J is ascribed to the exilic period, P must be of the post-exilic, or [[Second Temple]], period, likely in the 5th century. This reassessment of chronology places the Deuteronomist as the first writer (DJP) whereas the documentary hypothesis places the Deuteronomist as a later writer (JEDP).

=== Independence of the Yahwist and Priestly sources ===

Whereas the documentary hypothesis proposed that the four Pentateuch sources were complete and independent accounts, Van Seters writes that the supplementary hypothesis "does not view the later sources J and P as independent documents but as direct additions to the earlier corpus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Seters|first1=John|title=The Pentateuch: A Social-Science Commentary|date=1999|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis proposed that the Deuteronomist is the only independent source and that the Yahwist (J) is a reply to the Deuteronomic explanation of the Exile and a "confessional reformulation" as a theological corrective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kugler &amp; Hartin|title=An Introduction to the Bible|date=2009|publisher=William B. Eerdman's Publishing Co.|location=Cambridge|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the hypothesis views the Priestly (P) source as non-independent as well. Because many P texts, Van Seters argues, "do not make sense without the larger J context," the Priestly writer is viewed as a redactor of J. A major consequence of this view that the later two sources are not independent is the removal of the need for redactors to explain the cohesion of the Penteteuch. Van Seters writes, “Since there are no separate sources after the first one, there is no need for redactors. The elaborate system of multiple redactors used by current documentarians is unnecessary.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Seters|first1=John|title=The Pentateuch: A Social-Science Commentary|date=1999|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thermoluminescence dating''' ('''TL''') is the determination, by means of measuring the accumulated [[radiation]] dose, of the time elapsed since material containing [[crystal]]line minerals was either [[heat]]ed ([[lava]], [[ceramic]]s) or exposed to sunlight ([[sediment]]s). As a crystalline material is heated during measurements, the process of  [[thermoluminescence]] starts. Thermoluminescence emits a weak light signal that is proportional to the radiation dose absorbed by the material. It is a type of [[luminescence dating]].

The technique has wide application, and is relatively cheap at some US$300–700 per object; ideally a number of samples are tested.  Sediments are more expensive to date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smah.uow.edu.au/sees/facilities/UOW002896.html Thermoluminescence (TL) dating] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114336/http://smah.uow.edu.au/sees/facilities/UOW002896.html |date=2015-04-02 }}, University of Wollongong, Australia; [http://daybreaknuclear.us/bortolot_faq.html Daybreak Corporation, FAQs]; [http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/luminescence.html Oxford University]; [http://www.oxfordauthentication.com/ Oxford Authentification], see different prices depending on type&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of a relatively significant amount of sample material is necessary, which can be a limitation in the case of artworks. The heating must have taken the object above 500° C, which covers most ceramics, although very high-fired [[porcelain]] creates other difficulties.  It will often work well with stones that have been heated by fire. The clay core of bronze sculptures made by [[lost wax casting]] can also be tested.&lt;ref name="Bortolot 2001"&gt;[http://daybreaknuclear.us/tlpaper.pdf "Thermoluminescence dating of art objects"], V.J. Bortolot, Daybreak Corporation; [http://www.coupdefoudre.com/CurrentArticle/Thermo.html "The Limits of TL", Michel Brent, ''Archaeology Magazine'', Volume 54, Number 1, January/February 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

Different materials vary considerably in their suitability for the technique, depending on several factors.  Subsequent irradiation, for example if an x-ray is taken, can affect accuracy, as will the "annual dose" of radiation a buried object has received from the surrounding soil. Ideally this is assessed by measurements made at the precise findspot over a long period. For artworks, it may be sufficient to confirm whether a piece is broadly ancient or modern (that is, authentic or a fake), and this may be possible even if a precise date cannot be estimated.&lt;ref name="Bortolot 2001" /&gt;

== Functionality ==
Natural crystalline materials contain imperfections: impurity [[ion]]s, stress dislocations, and other phenomena that disturb the regularity of the [[electric field]] that holds the [[atom]]s in the crystalline lattice together.  These imperfections lead to local humps and dips in the crystalline material's [[electric potential]]. Where there is a dip (a so-called "[[electron]] trap"), a free [[electron]] may be attracted and trapped.

The flux of ionizing radiation&amp;mdash;both from [[cosmic radiation]] and from natural [[radioactivity]]&amp;mdash;excites electrons from atoms in the [[crystal lattice]] into the [[conduction band]] where they can move freely.  Most excited electrons will soon recombine with lattice ions, but some will be trapped, storing part of the [[energy]] of the radiation in the form of trapped [[electric charge]] ('''Figure 1''').

Depending on the depth of the traps (the energy required to free an electron from them) the storage time of trapped electrons will vary as ''some traps are sufficiently deep to store charge for hundreds of thousands of years''.

== In practical use ==
In thermoluminescence dating, these long-term traps are used to determine the age of materials: When irradiated crystalline material is again heated or exposed to strong light, the trapped electrons are given sufficient energy to escape. In the process of recombining with a lattice ion, they lose energy and emit [[photon]]s (light [[quantum|quanta]]), detectable in the [[laboratory]].

The amount of light produced is proportional to the number of trapped electrons that have been freed which is in turn proportional to the radiation dose accumulated. In order to relate the signal (the thermoluminescence&amp;mdash;light produced when the material is heated) to the radiation dose that caused it, it is necessary to [[calibrate]] the material with known doses of radiation since the [[density]] of traps is highly variable.

Thermoluminescence dating presupposes a "zeroing" event in the history of the material, either heating (in the case of pottery or lava) or exposure to sunlight (in the case of sediments), that removes the pre-existing trapped electrons. Therefore, at that point the thermoluminescence signal is zero.

As time goes on, the ionizing radiation field around the material causes the trapped electrons to accumulate ('''Figure 2'''). In the laboratory, the accumulated radiation dose can be measured, but this by itself is insufficient to determine the time since the zeroing event.

The ''Radiation Dose Rate'' - the dose accumulated per year-must be determined first. This is commonly done by measurement of the [[alpha particle|alpha radioactivity]] (the [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] content) and the [[potassium]] content (K-40 is a [[beta particle|beta]] and [[gamma ray|gamma]] emitter) of the sample material.

Often the [[gamma radiation]] field at the position of the sample material is measured, or it may be calculated from the alpha radioactivity and potassium content of the sample environment, and the [[cosmic ray]] dose is added in.  Once all components of the radiation field are determined, the accumulated dose from the thermoluminescence measurements is divided by the dose accumulating each year, to obtain the years since the zeroing event.

== Relation to radiocarbon dating ==
Thermoluminescence dating is used for material where [[radiocarbon dating]] is not available, like [[sediment]]s. Its use is now common in the authentication of old ceramic wares, for which it gives the approximate date of the last firing. An example of this can be seen in [http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/ant/079/ant0790390.htm Rink and Bartoll, 2005].

Thermoluminescence dating was modified for use as a ''passive sand migration analysis tool'' by [http://www.jcronline.org/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;doi=10.2112%2F04-0406.1 Keizars, ''et al.'', 2008] ('''Figure 3'''), demonstrating the direct consequences resulting from the improper replenishment of starving beaches using fine sands, as well as providing a ''passive'' method of policing [[beach nourishment|sand replenishment]] and observing riverine or other sand inputs along shorelines ('''Figure 4''').

[[File:Quartz UV NET NTL Curve.svg|thumb|Typical quartz TL curve measured with a UV filter during routine TL dating.]]

== Relation to other luminescence dating methods==
[[Optically stimulated luminescence]] dating is a related measurement method which replaces heating with exposure to intense light.  The sample material is illuminated with a very bright source of green or blue light (for [[quartz]]) or [[infrared light]] (for [[potassium feldspars]]).  [[Ultraviolet light]] emitted by the sample is detected for measurement.

'''''Thorbjørn Egners lesebøker''''' ({{lang-en|Thorbjorn Egner's Readers}}) were a series of sixteen [[Basal reader|readers]] for [[elementary school]] written by [[Norway|Norwegian]] author [[Thorbjørn Egner]]. Egner spent 25 years working on the series{{spaced ndash}}consisting of collected literature as well as his own stories and illustrations{{spaced ndash}}and they were published in the years 1950&amp;ndash;1972.&lt;ref name="NSF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skoleforum.com/stiler/saeroppgave/det.aspx?id=2929|title=Thorbjørn Egner|publisher=Norsk Skoleforum|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books were intended for children aged 8&amp;ndash;15, which at the time corresponded to grades 2nd&amp;ndash;9th.&lt;ref name="NSF"/&gt; Among the recurring characters was the young boy Ola-Ola, who grew up on a farm on the Norwegian countryside, but later moved to the city and had to adapt to a new life. Other stories took place in far-away lands, reminiscent of the environment in Egner's celebrated ''[[People and Robbers of Cardemon Town]]''. There were also a selection of songs and poems in between the stories.

The books took over the role held for decades by the readers of [[Nordahl Rolfsen]] in the Norwegian educational system. Rolfsen's books were published in the years 1892&amp;ndash;1895, and had been the standard works since, but starting in the 1950s, Egner's books took over this position. Egner himself considered the series to be the ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' of his collected works. In 1972, however{{spaced ndash}}the year when the last book in the series was published{{spaced ndash}}the educational program of Norwegian [[primary school]]s was altered. The new scheme largely abandoned the use of basic readers in the [[curriculum]]. As a result, Egner's textbooks were rendered virtually obsolete as educational tools.&lt;ref name="DP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dyreparken.no/kart-parkinfo/kardemomme_by/Thorbjorn-Egner/|title=Thorbjørn Egner-biografi|publisher=Dyreparken|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books remain an important part of the Norwegian cultural heritage, being considered children's classics, and some of them have been reprinted more recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bokkilden.no/SamboWeb/produkt.do?produktId=115869|title=Ola-Ola Heia|publisher=BokKilden|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universeum''' is a public science centre and museum in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]] that opened in 2001. It is a part of ''Evenemangsstråket'', the ''thoroughfare of events'' – close to [[Korsvägen]] and Skånegatan – which includes sights of interest like [[Scandinavium]], [[Ullevi]], [[Svenska Mässan]] (Swedish Exhibition Centre), [[Liseberg]] and the [[Museum of World Culture]].

Universeum is divided into six sections, each containing experiment workshops and a collection of [[reptile]]s, [[fish]] and [[insect]]s. Universeum occasionally gives Swedish secondary school students a chance to debate with [[Nobel prize]]-winners and professors.

==Main sections==

[[File:Basis of Membrane Potential2.png|thumbnail|The basis of membrane potential]]

An '''Ussing chamber''' is an apparatus for measuring epithelial membrane properties. It can detect and quantify transport and barrier functions of living tissue. The Ussing chamber was invented by the Danish [[zoologist]] and physiologist [[Hans Ussing|Hans Henriksen Ussing]] in 1946.&lt;ref name="goto"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926222255/http://goto.glocalnet.net/medimet/ ''The Ussing Pulse project'' (goto.glocalnet.net)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique is used to measure the short-circuit current as an indicator of net [[ion transport]] taking place across an [[epithelium]]. Ussing chambers are used to measure ion transport in native [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], such as gut [[mucosa]], and in a monolayer of [[cell (biology)|cells]] grown on permeable supports.

== Function ==

The Ussing chamber provides a system to measure the transport of ions, nutrients, and drugs across various epithelial tissues.&lt;ref name="pmc"&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2697950/ ''A guide to Ussing chamber studies of mouse intestine'' (Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol. Jun 2009; 296(6): G1151–G1166. Published online Apr 2, 2009.)]&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of two halves separated by the epithelia (sheet of mucosa or monolayer of epithelial cells grown on permeable supports). Epithelia are polar in nature, i.e., they have an [[apical membrane|apical]] or mucosal side and a [[basolateral]] or [[serosal]] side. An Ussing chamber can isolate the apical side from the basolateral side. The two half chambers are filled with equal amounts of symmetrical [[Ringer solution]] to remove chemical, mechanical or electrical driving forces. Ion transport takes place across any epithelium. Transport may be in either direction. Ion transport produces a [[potential difference]] (voltage difference) across the epithelium. The voltage is measured using two voltage [[electrodes]] placed near the tissue/epithelium. This voltage is cancelled out by injecting current, using two other current electrodes placed away from the epithelium. This short-circuit current (Isc) is the measure of net ion transport.

Measuring epithelial ion transport is helped by Ussing chambers. The voltage result from this ion transport is easy to accurately measure. The epithelium pumps ions from one side to the other and the ions leak back through so-called tight junctions that are situated between the epithelial cells. To measure ion transport, an external current is applied. Simply cancelling the voltage underestimates the true value. This is corrected by a short circuit at the voltage measuring electrodes. The resistance between the external voltage electrodes must be considered. The Isc underestimates the ion transport: the error can be as much as 10-fold. The type of chambers suggested by Ussing produces large errors. This error is often estimated by measuring the voltage without tissue present, leading to uncertain values. Better methods involve using [[alternating current]] in the form of sinuous-shaped current using several frequencies, [[square wave]] pulses, sharp impulses and random noise.&lt;ref name="goto"/&gt;
