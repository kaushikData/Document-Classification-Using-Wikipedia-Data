==Plot==
Aaravalli is a woman-centric story about a queen who rules over men. The story is set in the kingdom of Nellurupattinam, of which the main protagonist Aaravalli ([[G. Varalakshmi]]) and her sister Sooravalli (S. Mohana) are the undisputed rulers. They were seven sisters, but the reins of control were in the hands of Aravalli and Sooravalli, who are described as having magical powers. Bheema (Thirupathisamy) offers to conquer them, however he is defeated by these women, who also humiliate him and lock him up in prison. However, Bheema manages to escape the prison. Sooravalli visits Indraprasta and she complains to King Dharma (K. Nadarajan) about his brother Bheema. Dharma concedes to her demands and sends back his brother to Nellurupattinam.

The astrologer Sahadevan formulates a master plan against the two cunning women. The plan is to use their nephew Alli Muthu (S. G. Eswar), the son of their sister Sangavathy (M. S. Draupadi), for the specific purpose of challenging the position of sisters on behalf of the Pandavas. So, Alli Muthu and his companion named as Arayathi ([[Kaka Radhakrishnan]]) set out towards the kingdom Nellurupattinam.

On their arrival in Nellurupattinam, they meet the magician queens who ask Alli Muthu to undergo three challenges. Alli Muthu accepts these challenges and ventures to complete them. Alli Muthu meets Aaravalli's daughter Alangaravalli ([[Mynavathi]]) at the palace and is fascinated by her and eventually they both fall in love. Then, Alli Muthu performs the three challenges and comes victorious with the help of Alangaravalli. As a sign of their submission, the two queens offer their daughter Alangaravalli in marriage to the victorious Alli Muthu.

The newlywed couple and Arayathi arrive at Indraprasta kingdom. The pair make their way into forest where the bride (Alanaravalli) in her innocence, follows the instruction of her mother and gives poisoned sweets to her husband. After first intoxicating his sense with the fragrance of poisoned bouquet, she asks Arayathi for help to discover the dead body of her husband. Arayathi rescues her companion's life. She cursed her wicked mother and Aaravalli agrees all truth. Then, Sahadevan formulates a plan to discuss with Abimanyu (V. Gopalakrishnan) and Arayathi, that Alli Muthu's life shall not end. So, Sahadevan wants to know which type of poison was used on Alli Muthu.

Abimanyu and Aryathi get help to Singaravalli (T. P. Muthulakshmi), and told her in secret, that the poison is named as ''Karkotan''. Meanwhile, Aaravalli hears the news, so she disguises herself like a woman saint and begs to Dharma for food. Dharma arranges for lunch for her, but she sees Alli Muthu's dead body and the angered saint leaves the house. Then, she was forced to burn Alli Muthu's dead body. King Dharma arranged for the ritual event and set fire to Alli Muthu's body. Fortunately, Abhimanyu reaches at the correct time and saves Alli Muthu's life and curses his defeat. Then Alli Muthu captures the Nelluru Pattinam Kingdom. The two queens and his wife were arrested.

They are tried in front of King Dharma. But the two queens reject the case. So, King Dharma gives punishment to Alli Muthu. Then Alangavalli admitted to all crimes. King Dharma gives judgement to her and Aaravalli. Alangaram's head was to be cut off and her mother was to catch it. Then Alangaram requests to King Dharma, that her head was to be cut off by her husband hands; her mother stops the punishment and approved, Alli Muthu defeats death. Then Alli Muthu reunites with his wife.

'''''Baigneuses''''', also called '''''Bathers''''', is a [[Proto-Cubism|Proto-Cubist]] painting, now lost or missing, created circa 1908 by the French artist and theorist [[Jean Metzinger]]. Possibly exhibited during the spring of 1908 at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] (n. 4243).&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16028coll4/id/17386 Jean Metzinger, ''Baigneuse'', Société des artistes indépendants: catalogue de la 24ème exposition, 1908, p. 285]&lt;/ref&gt; This black-and-white image of Metzinger's painting, the only known photograph of the work, was reproduced in [[Gelett Burgess]], "The Wild Men of Paris", ''[[Architectural Record]]'', May 1910.&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess"&gt;[http://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11445-the-wild-men-of-paris Gelett Burgess, "The Wild Men of Paris: Matisse, Picasso, and Les Fauves", ''Architectural Record'', May 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecturalrecord.com/ext/resources/news/2016/02-Feb/wild-men-of-paris-architectural-record-may-1910.pdf Gelett Burgess, "The Wild Men of Paris: Matisse, Picasso, and Les Fauves", ''Architectural Record'', May 1910, p. 412 (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was also reproduced in ''The New York Times'', 8 October 1911, in an article titled "The 'Cubists' Dominate Paris' Fall Salon", and subtitled, "Eccentric School of Painting Increases Its Vogue in the Current Art Exhibition - What Its Followers Attempt to Do".&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/10/08/104878571.pdf ''New York Times'', October 8, 1911]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Baigneuses'', likely an oil painting on canvas (as practically all Metzingers' works of the period), was painted in a vertical format with unknown dimensions.

The work represents at least four nude women (or bathers) relaxing in a highly [[abstract art|abstract]] landscape with vegetation and a small body of water visible through reflections and from the woman on the left whose legs are submerged from the knees down. The central figure holds the trunk of a tree with her left arm and a woman with her right, forming a tight central mass. The two nudes at the center, treated in a light color, stand-out against a darker background. They are flanked on both sides by a standing and a sitting nude.

The colors of the painting, as its dimensions and whereabouts, are unknown

==The Wild Men of Paris==
Leading up to 1910, the draftsman, illustrator and poet [[Gelett Burgess]] interviewed and wrote about artists and artworks in and around Paris. The result of Burgess' investigation was published after his visit to the 1910 [[Salon des Indépendants]], the massive anti-establishment art exhibition in Paris, and one year before the scandalous group exhibition that brought [[Cubism]] to the attention of the general public. At the 1910 Indépendants Jean Metzinger showed his ''Portrait of Apollinaire'' (the first Cubist portrait according to [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]); [[Albert Gleizes]] showed his ''Portrait de René Arcos'' and ''[[L'Arbre, The Tree (Gleizes)|L'Arbre (The Tree)]]'', paintings in which the emphasis on simplified geometric form overwhelms representational interests.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881–1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S. E. Johnson"&gt;S. E. Johnson, 1964, Metzinger, Pre-Cubist and Cubist Works, 1900–1930, International Galleries, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Vauxcelles]] in his review of the 1910 Salon des Indépendants made a passing and imprecise reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, [[Robert Delaunay|Delaunay]], [[Fernand Léger|Léger]] and [[Henri Le Fauconnier|Le Fauconnier]], as "ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7527626n/f1.item Louis Vauxcelles, ''A travers les salons: promenades aux « Indépendants »'', Gil Blas, 18 March 1910]&lt;/ref&gt; The works of Metzinger, Le Fauconnier and Delaunay were exhibited together. Le Fauconnier showed the geometrically simplified ''Ploumanac'h'' landscapes: ''Le Ravin'' and ''Village dans les Montagne'', along with ''Femme à l'éventail'' and ''Portrait of Maroussia''. In the same exhibition hung the works of [[Henri Matisse]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Kees van Dongen]] and [[Henri Rousseau]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme"&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt323.html Kubisme.info, Salon des Indépendants]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gelett Burgess writes in ''The Wild Men of Paris'' of the same exhibition:

&lt;Blockquote&gt;There were no limits to the audacity and the ugliness of the canvasses. Still-life sketches of round, round apples and yellow, yellow oranges, on square, square tables, seen in impossible perspective; landscapes of squirming trees, with blobs of virgin color gone wrong, fierce greens and coruscating yellows, violent purples, sickening reds and shuddering blues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

But the nudes! They looked like flayed Martians, like pathological charts—hideous old women, patched with gruesome hues, lopsided, with arms like the arms of a Swastika, sprawling on vivid backgrounds, or frozen stiffly upright, glaring through misshapen eyes, with noses or fingers missing. They defied anatomy, physiology, almost geometry itself!&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the death of [[Paul Cézanne]] in 1906, his paintings were exhibited in Paris in the form of several large exhibitions and a retrospective at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1907, greatly affecting the direction taken by the avant-garde artists in Paris. Prior to the advent of [[Cubism]], Cézanne's geometric simplifications and optical phenomena inspired not just Metzinger, Matisse, Derain and [[Georges Braque|Braque]], but the other artists who earlier exhibited with the [[Fauvism|Fauves]]. Those who had not transited through a Fauve stage, such as Picasso, also experimented with the complex fracturing of form. Cézanne had thus sparked a wholesale transformation in the area of artistic investigation that would profoundly affect the development [[modern art]].&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;
The Fauvism of Metzinger, Matisse and [[André Derain|Derain]] was virtually over by the spring of 1907. And by the Salon d'Automne of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. The priority of simplified form began to overtake the representational aspect of the works. The simplification of representational form gave way to a new complexity; the subject matter of the paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

Burgess continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though the school was new to me, it was already an old story in Paris. It had been a nine-days’ wonder. Violent discussions had raged over it; it had taken its place as a revolt and held it, despite the fulmination of critics and the contempt of academicians. The school was increasing in numbers, in importance. By many it was taken seriously. At first, the beginners had been called "The Invertebrates." In the Salon of 1905 they were named "The Incoherents." But by 1906, when they grew more perfervid, more audacious, more crazed with theories, they received their present appellation of "Les Fauves"—the Wild Beasts. And so, and so, a-hunting I would go!&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Turning his attention to Metzinger's abode, Burgess writes in The Architectural Record:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Metzinger once did gorgeous mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of color not quite touching the next, so that an effect of vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair, even as the women upon the boulevards fair. But now, translated into the idiom of subjective beauty, into this strange Neo-Classic language, those same women, redrawn, appear in stiff, crude, nervous lines in patches of fierce color. Surely, Metzinger should know what such things mean. Picasso never painted a pretty woman, though we have noticed that he likes to associate with them. Czobel sees them through the bars of his cage, and roars out tones of mauve and cinnabar. Derain sees them as cones and prisms, and Braque as if they had been sawn out of blocks of wood by carpenters’ apprentices. But Metzinger is more tender towards the sex. He arranges them as flowers are arranged on tapestry and wall paper; he simplifies them to mere patterns, and he carries them gently past the frontier of Poster Land to the world of the Ugly so tenderly that they are not much damaged—only more faint, more vegetable, more anaemic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

What’s Metzinger? A scrupulously polite, well-dressed gentleman as ever was, in a scrupulously neat chamber, with a scrupulously well-ordered mind. He is complete as a wax figure, with long brown eyelashes and a clean-cut face. He affects no idiosyncrasies of manners or dress. One cannot question his earnestness and seriousness or sincerity. He is, perhaps, the most articulate of them all. Let us not call him prim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"Instead of copying Nature," [Metzinger] says, "we create a ''milieu'' of our own, wherein our sentiment can work itself out through a juxtaposition of colors. It is hard to explain it, but it may perhaps be illustrated by analogy with literature and music. Your own Edgar Poe (he pronounced it ‘Ed Carpoe’) did not attempt to reproduce Nature realistically. Some phase of life suggested an emotion, as that of horror in ‘The Fall of the House of Ushur.’ That subjective idea he translated into art. He made a composition of it."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"So, music does not attempt to imitate Nature’s sounds, but it does interpret and embody emotions awakened by Nature through a convention of its own, in a way to be aesthetically pleasing. In some such way, we, taking out hint from Nature, construct decoratively pleasing harmonies and symphonies of color expression of our sentiment." (Jean Metzinger, circa 1909)&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Metzinger, Picasso, and Braque==

There is a close association between Metzinger's ''Baigneuses (Bathers)'' and Picasso's 1908 ''Paysage aux deux figures (Landscape with Two Figures)''. Both stances are verbalized with the same abstract vocabulary. In both cases, the figures are camouflaged or blended with the background, their bodies forming part of the landscape. These works were completed at a time when Metzinger frequented the Bateau Lavoir in [[Montmartre]], where he may have seen Picasso's painting. There are differences, too, worth noting between the two works (aside from the size and colors which are unknown in the Metzinger case). While the dominant feature of Picasso's painting is the landscape, Metzinger chose to highlight the figures; the landscape playing only a secondary role in the overall composition. Metzinger's figures are much larger relative to the canvas. They are prominently and symmetrically displayed, and of lighter color contrast relative to Picasso's asymmetrical juxtaposition and subdued contrasting. Two of Metzinger's nudes—to the right and left of the dominant central figures—are quite inconspicuous, as in Picasso's piece. In both paintings the nudes and landscape have become unified, not presuming a representation of reality.

They are the product of a reductive abstracting process, of an open, freewheeling process of synthesis—where a dialogue between components lead to the liberation from any particular classical foundation. They are combined harmoniously though pictographic imagery rendered in residuum abstractions of apparent mathematical codes. In the case of Metzinger, his prowess in mathematics is well documented.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; In the case of Picasso, the mathematical association with his paintings has been made through [[Maurice Princet]].

Metzinger's early interests in mathematics is well documented.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; He was familiar with the works of [[Gauss]], [[Riemann]] and [[Jules Henri Poincaré]] (and perhaps Galilean relativity) prior to the development of Cubism: something that reflects in his pre-1907 works.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann"&gt;[http://jean-metzinger.blogspot.com.es/ Alex Mittelmann, 2012, ''Jean Metzinger, Divisionism, Cubism, Neoclassicism and Post-Cubism'']&lt;/ref&gt; The French mathematician [[Maurice Princet]] promoted the work of Poincaré, along with the concept of the [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth spatial dimension]], to artists at the [[Bateau-Lavoir]]. He was a close associate of Pablo Picasso, Guillaume Apollinaire, [[Max Jacob]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and Jean Metzinger. Princet is known as "le mathématicien du cubisme." He brought to the attention of these artists a book entitled ''Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions'' by [[Esprit Jouffret]] (1903) a popularization of Poincaré's ''Science and Hypothesis''. In this book Jouffret described [[hypercubes]] and complex [[polyhedra]] in four dimensions projected onto a two-dimensional page. Princet became estranged from the group after his wife left him for André Derain. However, Princet would remain close to Metzinger and participate in meetings of the [[Section d'Or]] in [[Puteaux]]. He gave informal lectures to the artists, many of whom were passionate about mathematical order. In 1910, Metzinger said of him, "[Picasso] lays out a free, mobile perspective, from which that ingenious mathematician Maurice Princet has deduced a whole geometry".&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, October–November 1910, "Note sur la peinture" Pan: 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Picasso's ''Landscape with Two Figures'' is almost entirely Cézannian, in its color, in its reduction to simplified forms and in its loose brushwork. Picasso still shows a sense of depth perspective through shading, despite some flattening of the surface. Metzinger's painting is less influenced by Cézanne in its brushstrokes, hardly visible in this photograph. Its quasi-[[Nabis]] post-[[Symbolism (art)|Symbolist]] treatment can be observed, but Metzinger vacates all [[depth of field]]. The background and foreground have become one. The only devices that indicate depth are (1) elevation in the picture plane; lower is closer and further is higher, and (2) objects in front of others obscure the object in the background, such as the central nude appears in front of the nude she holds with her right hand.

In both paintings, the faces of the models have been left out, featureless, reduced to their simplest spherical form.

In light of the fact that Metzinger frequented the Bateau Lavoir since 1908 and exhibited with Georges Braque at Berthe Weill's gallery,&lt;ref name="Joann Moser"&gt;Joann Moser, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Pre-Cubist works, 1904–1909'', p.&amp;nbsp;35, 1985, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press&lt;/ref&gt; introduced to Picasso by [[Max Jacob]] and Guillaume Krotowsky (who already signed his works [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]),&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Russell T. Clement"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VcaMyvjUZhIC&amp;pg=PR23&amp;lpg=PR23&amp;dq=salle+VII,+salon+d'automne+de+1905&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=alVRJahAml&amp;sig=6SkzgOftNxhpsdYdDNKbJjzqXUY&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=metzinger&amp;f=false Russell T. Clement, 1994, ''Les Fauves: A sourcebook'']&lt;/ref&gt; and in view of the similarities between the two works, it is probable that Metzinger's ''Bathers'' was painted the same year; 1908. The differences between the two paintings suggest that, while Metzinger may have been influenced by Picasso (unlike [[Albert Gleizes]]), his intention was certainly not to copy or even resemble the Spaniard, as would soon Braque (or ''visa versa''). His intention was to create his own brand of art, dependent on his own lived experience.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Then the kingdom of the Fauves whose civilization had appeared so new, so powerful, so startling, took on suddenly the aspect of a deserted village.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It was then that Jean Metzinger, joining Picasso and Braque, founded the Cubist City. (Guillaume Apolllinaire, 1913)&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/mjp/render.php?id=1299781650906252&amp;view=mjp_object Guillaume Apolllinaire, ''Aesthetic Meditations, On Painting, The Cubist Painters, Second Series'', The Little Review: Quarterly Journal of Art and Letters, Vol. 9, No. 1: Stella Number, Anderson, Margaret C. (editor), New York: Margaret C. Anderson, 1922–09 (Autumn 1922), Modernist Journals Project, Brown University and the University of Tulsa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whether in advanced non-objective mathematical workings or abstract geometrical form, along with his non-representative dislocated outward appearance, Metzinger creates a pure image—''"the total image"''.

By 1908–09, in such studies as ''Baigneuses (Bathers), it is apparent that Metzinger was not following the lead of Picasso or Braque in their hermetic approach to painting—he had little interest in imitating, whether it be "an orb on a vertical plane" or anything else—Metzinger was on a path leading to abstraction and to the almost total disintegration of recognizable form.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

==''New York Times'', 1911==
Metzinger's ''Baigneuses'' was reproduced in the 8 October 1911 issue of ''The New York Times''. This article was published a year after ''The Wild Men of Paris'', and two years prior to the [[Armory Show]], which introduced astonished Americans, accustomed to realistic art, to the experimental styles of the European avant garde, including Fauvism, Cubism, and Futurism. The 1911 ''New York Times'' article, a review of the 1911 [[Salon d'Automne]], portrayed works by Picasso, Matisse, Derain, Metzinger and others dated before 1909; not exhibited at the 1911 Salon. The article is titled: "The 'Cubists' Dominate Paris' Fall Salon" and subtitled, "Eccentric School of Painting Increases Its Vogue in the Current Art Exhibition - What Its Followers Attempt to Do."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

:"Among all the paintings on exhibition at the Paris Fall Salon none is attracting so much attention as the extraordinary productions of the so-called "Cubist" school. In fact, dispatches from Paris suggest that these works are easily the main feature of the exhibition. [...]

:In spite of the crazy nature of the "Cubist" theories the number of those professing them is fairly respectable. Georges Braque, André Derain, Picasso, Czobel, Othon Friesz, Herbin, Metzinger—these are a few of the names signed to canvases before which Paris has stood and now again stands in blank amazement.

:What do they mean? Have those responsible for them taken leave of their senses? Is it art or madness? Who knows?"&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

==Proto-Cubism==
{{main|Proto-Cubism}}
According to Metzinger, in his ''Cubism was Born'', published years later, Cubism had been born out of the "need not for an intellectual art but for an art that would be something other than a systematic absurdity"; the idiocies of reproducing or copying nature in [[trompe l'oeil]] on a surface that is rigorously flat. With this type of illusion other artist of his generation such as Gleizes and Picasso wanted nothing to do. "Quite clearly" Metzinger notes, "nature and the painting make up two different worlds which have nothing in common&amp;nbsp;..." Already, in 1906, "it could be said that a good portrait led one to think about the painter not the model".&lt;ref name="Metzinger"&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Le Cubisme était Né: Souvenirs par Jean Metzinger'' (Cubism was Born), Présence, Chambéry, 1972. (This text written by Jean Metzinger was supplied to the publisher Henri Viaud by Metzinger's widow Suzanne Phocas). Translation Peter Brooke&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Le Cubisme était Né: Souvernirs'', Metzinger writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As for Picasso&amp;nbsp;... the tradition he came from had prepared him better than ours for a problem to do with structure. And Berthe Weil was right when she treated those who compared him/confused him with, a Steinlen or a Lautrec as idiots. He had already rejected them in their own century, a century we had no intention of prolonging. Whether or not the Universe was endowed with another dimension, art was going to move into a different field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The illusion had been maintained up to 1906 or 1907 through the negligence of those whose job it was to clear away the rubbish, but the break was achieved in 1908. No-one would again dare to look at a Puvis de Chavannes or read Balzac. No-one, I mean, among those who walked above the Moulin Rouge, which they would never even have thought of entering.&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Both Metzinger's studio on the rue Lamarck and Picasso's [[Bateau Lavoir]] studio on the rue Ravignan were above the Moulin Rouge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Metzinger continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I had measured the difference that separated art prior to 1900 from the art which I felt was being born. I knew that all instruction was at an end. The age of personal expression had finally begun. The value of an artist was no longer to be judged by the finish of his execution, or by the analogies his work suggested with such-and-such an archetype. It would be judged – exclusively – by what distinguished this artist from all the others. The age of the master and pupil was finally over; I could see about me only a handful of creators and whole colonies of monkeys. (Jean Metzinger, Cubism was Born)&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From his [[Montmartre]] studio on the rue Lamarck to Picasso's Bateau Lavoir studio on the rue Ravignan, writes Metzinger, "the attempt [''prétention''] to imitate an orb on a vertical plane, or to indicate by a horizontal straight line the circular hole of a vase placed at the height of the eyes was considered as the artifice of an illusionistic trickery that belonged to another age."&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I wanted an art that was faithful to itself and would have nothing to do with the business of creating illusions. I dreamed of painting glasses from which no-one would ever think of drinking, beaches that would be quite unsuitable for bathing, nudes who would be definitively chaste. I wanted an art which in the first place would appear as a representation of the impossible. (Metzinger)&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was the search for beauty that had attracted Metzinger to the abstract. Beauty depends not only on geometrical forms or simplified colors, but plainly beauty as it exists in itself. It wasn't just the simple result of a reductive approach to the elements of all the parts. It wasn't either just a dialectic view of everything that led him just as simply to treat each object as opposed to the other, and therefore thoroughly distinct. The blurring of differences was against the entire tenor of the whole.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;

The narrative of Metzinger outlined by his ''Bathers'' schematic geometric arrangements was the result of an abstracting process not solely based on "axiomatics". These axiomatic abstractions, however, by themselves contain no assertions as to the reality that can be experienced, not in a logical sense deduced from experience, but free inventions of the human mind, abstractions, construed by mathematical means. With works such as ''Bathers'' had emerged a growing accent on the power of the mind to create for itself, a growing spirit of abstraction, of invention, fabrication.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;

As one would expect, Metzinger’s concept of painting was both more sophisticated and perceptive than Cézanne, but fundamentally the shape of the misunderstandings that were to follow Cubism were the same as Cézanne's, and so too were the implications. Metzinger had seen painting as rooted in the experience of nature: four-dimensional and geometric. He stressed this heavily, and at the same time brought out the ''flatness'' and dislocations of Cézanne’s transformations of nature—with the conceptual aspect of multiple perspectives and non-Euclidean spacetime. The importance of Cubism, he accepted, was to emphasize the idea that everything visible (objects) and invisible (consciousness) has an ''n''-dimensional geometric basis (an idea he associated with ‘construct an infinite number of different spaces for the use of painters’).&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nearly conscious in someone like Michelangelo, or Paolo Uccello, quite intuitive in painters such as Ingres, or Corot, it works on the basis of numbers which belong to the painting itself, not to whatever it represents. (Metzinger)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Berlinische Monatsschrift.jpg|thumbnail|Cover, 1783]]
The '''''Berlinische Monatsschrift''''' was a monthly magazine published by [[Johann Erich Biester]] and [[Friedrich Gedike]] (though the latter resigned his editorship in 1791).

It served primarily as the mouthpiece for the [[Berliner Mittwochsgesellschaft]] (Berlin Wednesday Society). It is considered [[Immanuel Kant]]’s preferred magazine, mainly due to its debate on the question of ‘What is Enlightenment?’

The magazine was initially published between 1783 and 1796. This was succeeded by the ''Berlinische Blätter'', published by Biester, between 1797 and 1798.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://katalogplus.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/cgi-bin/new_titel.cgi?katkey=2239816&amp;query=berlinische+monatsschrift&amp;vr=1&amp;pagesize=10&amp;bestand=lok&amp;sess=88c617009f1ef19f94263cbffa8e1af8|title=Berlinische Monatschrift|website=katalogplus.ub.uni-bielefeld.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then revived by Friedrich Nicolai, who published it as ''Neue Berlinische Monatsschrift'' from 1799 until 1811.

In 1998 all 58 editions of the ''Berlinische Monatsschrift'', plus its successors, amounting to approximately 30,300 pages, were digitised by the library of the [[Bielefeld University]].

The subject matter of childlore includes the traditions of children between the ages of about 6 and 15 such as games, [[riddles]], rhymes, jokes, pranks, [[superstition]]s, magical practices, [[wit]], [[lyrics]], [[Wiktionary:guile#Etymology|guile]], [[wiktionary:epithets|epithets]], nicknames, torments, [[parody]], oral legislation, seasonal customs, tortures, obscenities, codes, etc.&lt;ref name="Sutton"&gt;[[Brian Sutton-Smith|Sutton-Smith]] 1970:1–8.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as individual activities such as solitary play, [[daydream]]ing, fantasies, imaginary companions and heroes, collections, scrapbooks, model worlds, comic reading, mass media interests, dramatizations, stories, art, etc.&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt; 

As a branch of folklore, childlore is concerned with those activities which are learned and passed on by children to other children. The stories and games taught by adults to children are not considered childlore except insofar as the children adapt and make them their own. In western culture most folklorists are concerned with children after they join their peers in elementary school or kindergarten. The traditions of childhood generally stop after the child enters intermediate school, which coincides with puberty and adolescence.&lt;ref name="Grider"&gt;Grider 1980:159–160&lt;/ref&gt;

Opie and Opie demonstrate that the culture of children is quite distinctive and is as unnoticed by the sophisticated world, and quite as little affected by it.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Opie stated that the words of one game ([[Buck buck]]) had survived from the time of [[Nero]].&lt;ref name="Opie"&gt;Opie: 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The conservatism of childlore contrasts with the way adult folklore is rapidly modified to fit changing circumstances.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

'''Contemporary African art''' is commonly understood to be art made by artists in Africa and the African diaspora in the post-independence era. However, there are about as many understandings of contemporary African art as there are curators, scholars and artists working in that field. All three terms of this "wide-reaching noncategory [sic]"&lt;ref&gt;Firstenberg, Lauri (2003). "Negotiating the Taxonomy of Contemporary African Art – Production, Exhibition, Commodification", in Farrell, L. A., V. Byvanck (eds), ''Looking Both Ways: Art of the Contemporary African Diaspora''. New York: Museum for African Art, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; are problematic in themselves: What exactly is "contemporary", what makes art "African", and when are we talking about art and not any other kind of creative expression? Western scholars and curators have made numerous attempts at defining contemporary African art in the 1990s and early 2000s and proposed a range of categories and genres. They triggered heated debates and controversies especially on the foundations of postcolonial critique. Recent trends indicate a far more relaxed engagement with definitions and identity ascriptions. The global presence and entanglement of Africa and its contemporary artists have become a widely acknowledged fact that still requires and provokes critical reflection but finds itself beyond the pressure of self-justification.

== Scope ==
Although African art has always been contemporary to its producers, the term "contemporary African art" implies a particular kind of art that has conquered, or, as some would say, has been absorbed by the international art world and art market since the 1980s. It is in that decade when Europe and the US became aware of art made in Africa by individual artists, thus breaking with the colonial tradition of assuming collective "ethnic" origins of so-called "tribal art" as found in most ethnographic collections.&lt;ref name="Firstenberg, Lauri 2003 p. 37-41"&gt;Firstenberg (2003). "Negotiating the Taxonomy of Contemporary African Art", in Farrell and Byvanck (eds), ''Looking Both Ways'', pp. 37-41.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition ''Magiciens de la terre'' by [[Jean-Hubert Martin]] in 1989 is widely considered (but also challenged as) a key exhibition in this very recent history of international reception of African and other non-western art.  However, this reception, too, has its roots in an exotizing and mystifying view on African culture from a dominant western position, as [[Rasheed Araeen]] argued in his response to ''Magiciens de la terre''.&lt;ref name="Araeen, Rasheed 1989 p. 3-16"&gt;Araeen, Rasheed (1989). "Our Bauhaus Others' Mudhouse", ''Third Text'' no. 6, pp. 3–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Firstenberg, Lauri (2003). “Negotiating the Taxonomy of Contemporary African Art – Production, Exhibition, Commodification”, in Farrell, L. A., Byvanck, V. (eds), ''Looking both Ways: Art of the Contemporary African Diaspora''. New York: Museum for African Art, pp. 37-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, although this exhibition and many that followed had a strong influence in creating a kind of a common understanding of what constitutes contemporary African art, it is true that it has been and still is subject to discussions and controversies. Almost every exhibition following ''Magiciens de la terre'' offered a taxonomy or system of categorization that helped to reflect the very notion of contemporary African art, but they failed to recognize the postcolonial need of giving up the Eurocentric epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;Mosquera, Gerardo (1995). “Das Marco-Polo-Syndrom”, in Hermanns, U. (ed.), ''Havanna. Sao Paulo. Junge Kunst aus Lateinamerika''. Berlin: Haus der Kulturen der Welt, p. 34-39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Firstenberg, Lauri 2003 p. 37-41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nzegwu, Nkiru 1998 p. 1-18"&gt;Nzegwu, Nkiru (1998). "Introduction: Contemporary African Art and Exclusionary Politics", ''Issues in Contemporary African Art''. Binghamton, NY: International Society for the Study of Africa ISSA, pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary African art is believed to feature particularities typical to African aesthetics while at the same time it shares properties with other international contemporary arts. Therefore, it is both, shaped by and feeding into the globalizing art worlds and art markets, like any other contemporary arts. At the same time, there are a lot of contemporary art practices and forms in African regions and cities that are almost exclusively locally known. While meeting all three requirements of being contemporary, art, and African, they fail to fit into a certain type of art production that has been spreading on the international art market in the last 30 years.

Exhibitions variously showed work by artists based in Africa; by artists using aesthetics typical to African traditions; by African artists living in the West but including aesthetics and topics related to their "roots";&lt;ref name="Araeen, Rasheed 1989 p. 3-16"/&gt; traditional artworks related to customary practices such as rituals; and urban African art that reflects the modern experience of cultural pluralism and hybridity. Modernity as a colonial and postcolonial experience appears as an intrinsic and significant attribute in most conceptions of contemporary African art. Scholars and curators therefore have proposed a wide range of taxonomies that tried firstly to define what is African about this art, and secondly, the range of genres it covers. Diverse attempts to define particular genres of contemporary African art however mirrored the fascination of art scholars and curators for the appropriation of cultural elements assumed "Western" into "African" modes of expression and traditions. One example is Marshall W. Mount&lt;ref&gt;Mount, Marshall W. (1973). ''African Art: The Years since 1920.'' Bloomington: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; who proposed four categories: first, "survivals of traditional styles", which show continuities in traditional working material and methods such as bronze casting or wood carving; secondly, art inspired by Christian missions; thirdly, souvenir art in the sense of tourist or airport art as defined later by Jules-Rossette;&lt;ref&gt;Jules-Rosette, Bennetta (1984). ''The Messages of Tourist Art: An African Semiotic System in Comparative Perspective.'' Boston: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; and finally, an emerging art requiring "techniques that were unknown or rare in traditional African art".&lt;ref&gt;Marshall W. Mount (1973) quoted in: Mudimbe, Valentin Y. (1991). "'Reprendre': Enunciations and Strategies in Contemporary African Arts", in Vogel, S. (ed.), ''Africa Explores: 20th Century African Art''. Munich: Prestel, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; Valentin Y. Mudimbe in turn proposes to think of three currents rather than categories, namely a "tradition-inspired" one, a "modernist" trend, and "a popular art"&lt;ref name="Mudimbe, Valentin Y. 1991 p. 280"&gt;Mudimbe, Valentin Y. (1991). "'Reprendre': Enunciations and Strategies in Contemporary African Arts", in Vogel, S. (ed.), ''Africa Explores: 20th Century African Art''. Munich: Prestel, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; whereby Mount’s categories would be situated somewhere "between the tradition-inspired and the modernist trend”.&lt;ref name="Mudimbe, Valentin Y. 1991 p. 280"/&gt; Similar to other categorizations, this proposal considers the education of the artists as well as the envisaged clientele/patrons as important factors for the respective "currents". In the exhibition catalogue of ''Africa Explores'' (1991), curator Susan Vogel distinguished between "traditional art", "new functional art", "urban art", "international art", and "extinct art".&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Susan, ed. (1991). ''Africa Explores: 20th Century African Art''. Munich: Prestel.&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting these categories, collector André Magnin proposed to group similar works into sections named "territory", "frontier" and "world" in his survey book ''Contemporary African Art'', thus placing them into "imaginary maps".&lt;ref&gt;Magnin, André, and Jacques Soulillou, eds (1996). ''Contemporary Art of Africa.'' London: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this approach was also criticized by Dele Jegede with convincing arguments against its ethnocentric perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Jegede, Dele (1998). "On Scholars and Magicians: A Review of 'Contemporary Art of Africa'", in Nzegwu, N. (ed.), ''Issues in Contemporary African Art''. Binghamton: International Society for the Study of Africa ISSA, pp. 187-195.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, he pointed to the hubris of attempts to talk about art of a whole continent, but also to the common reflex to exclude Northern Africa in such considerations and to follow a global rather than "particularistic focus on the study of the art of the continent" that would provide more specific and deeper bodies of knowledge. In the 1990 exhibition ''Contemporary African Artists: Changing Tradition'', the [[Studio Museum in Harlem]] tried to take the perspective of the presented artists and distinguished between African artists who refuse outside influences; African artists who adopt modes of Western art; and African artists who fuse both strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Studio Museum, ed. (1990): ''Contemporary African Artists. Changing Tradition''. New York: Studio Museum in Harlem.&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonality to all these categorizations is their reliance on dichotomies between art and craft, Europe and Africa, urban and rural, and traditional and contemporary. These dichotomies tend to consider mutual influences in African and European art as an exception rather than the norm. Even more, they fail to think of African art independent from Europe as its counterpart or "influence", resulting in a frequent reproach of African artists "copycatting" or "mimicking" European achievements of modernism.&lt;ref name="Oguibe, Olu 1999 p. 16-29"&gt;Oguibe, Olu (1999). "Art, Identity, Boundaries: Postmodernism and Contemporary African Art", in Oguibe, O., and O. Enwezor (eds), ''Reading the Contemporary: African Art from Theory to the Marketplace''. Cambridge: MIT Press, pp. 16–29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nzegwu, Nkiru 1998 p. 1-18"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Enwezor, Okwui, and Chika Okeke-Agulu (2009). ''Contemporary African Art since 1980.'' Bologna: Damiani, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kasfir, Sidney L. (1999). ''Contemporary African Art.'' London/New York: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; Such Eurocentric attitudes have been revealingly criticized by theorists such as [[Olu Oguibe]],&lt;ref name="Oguibe, Olu 1999 p. 16-29"/&gt; Rasheed Araeen,&lt;ref name="Araeen, Rasheed 1989 p. 3-16"/&gt; Nkiru Nzegwu,&lt;ref name="Nzegwu, Nkiru 1998 p. 1-18"/&gt; [[Okwui Enwezor]] or Salah Hassan.&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, Salah (1999). "The Modernist Experience in African Art: Visual Expressions of the Self and Cross-cultural Aesthetics", in Oguibe, O., and O. Enwezor (eds), ''Reading the Contemporary: African Art from Theory to the Marketplace''. Cambridge: MIT Press, pp. 214–235.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is not easy to solve, and in some cases it is tackled by simply subverting any attempt of categorization. ''Seven Stories about Modern Art in Africa'', directed by [[Clémentine Deliss]] and curated by [[Chika Okeke-Agulu]], Salah Hassan, [[David Koloane]], Wanjiku Nyachae and El Hadji Sy (London, 1995) is a case in point.&lt;ref&gt;Deliss, Clémentine, ed. (1995). ''Seven Stories about Modern Art in Africa.'' Paris/New York: Flammarion.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than grafting binary taxonomies, it narrated seven modern art histories in different parts of Africa by invited curators and artists who were familiar with these recent histories and their respective art scenes. The exhibition proved to offer a highly complex, historically informed and well-researched presentation. Another example for subverting binary taxonomies is the book ''Contemporary African Art after 1980'' by Okwui Enwezor and Chika Okeke-Agulu.&lt;ref&gt;Enwezor, Okwui, and Chika Okeke-Agulu (2009). ''Contemporary African Art since 1980.'' Bologna: Damiani.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than putting contemporary African art in relation to Western traditions, they contrast it with modern African art, in that it defies linear grand narratives of modernism and is radically postcolonial. "[F]irst, within categories of time, it is neither belated nor does it exist out of time; second, because it is post-historical, it did not emerge out of a succession of historical styles; third, because it is critical of colonial valorization of an authentic past, it is postcolonial; and fourth, in relation to its postcoloniality, it seeks, according to Hans Belting’s thesis, to be post-ethnic […]. Neither being out of time nor belated, contemporary African art strategically inhabits a third epistemological space by being in time."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As they add, this being "fundamentally of its time" counts for all contemporary art, not only the African. In their book, Enwezor and Okeke-Agulu discuss contemporary African art by its approaches and guiding topics rather than trying to define categories on the basis of styles, markets or traditions. Their chapters therefore are designated as "Between postcolonial utopia and postcolonial realism", "Networks of practice" in the globalized field of cultural production, "Politics, culture and critique", "Archive, document, memory", "Abstraction, figuration and subjectivity" and "The body politic: difference, gender, sexuality". Doing so, they locate contemporary African art within a historical perspective, something that had largely missed in previous discussions.

'''Defensive design''' is the practice of planning for [[Contingency plan|contingencies]] in the [[design]] stage of a project or undertaking. Essentially, it is the practice of anticipating all possible ways that an end-user could misuse a device, and designing the device so as to make such misuse impossible, or to minimize the negative consequences. For example, if it is important that a plug is inserted into a socket in a particular orientation, the socket and plug should be designed so that it is physically impossible to insert the plug incorrectly. Power sockets are often keyed in such a manner, to prevent the transposition of live and neutral.

Defensive design in [[software engineering]] is called [[defensive programming]]. [[Murphy's law]] is a well-known statement of the need for defensive design. It is considered the opposite approach to [[design by contract]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://en.wikipedia.org | title = Design by contract | date = 2017-05-17 | publisher = Wikipedia | location = Internet | language = English | format = HTML | archiveurl = https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Design_by_contract&amp;oldid=780850256 | archivedate = 2017-05-17 | accessdate = 2017-07-25 | quote = The DbC approach assumes all client components that invoke an operation on a server component will meet the preconditions specified as required for that operation.

The '''Dering Roll'''&lt;ref&gt;British Library Digitised Manuscripts, ref. [http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Add_Roll_77720 Add. Roll 77720].&lt;/ref&gt; is the oldest English [[roll of arms]] surviving in its original form. It was made between 1270 and 1280 and contains the [[coat of arms]] of 324 knights, starting with two illegitimate children of [[John, King of England|King John]]. [[Sir Edward Dering, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Dering]]&lt;ref&gt;S.P. Salt, 'Dering, Sir Edward, first Baronet (1598-1644)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004).

Wagner, ''English Genealogy'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford 1960), p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually purchased by the [[British Library]] (as Add Roll 77720) following fund raising involving a number of other charities and individuals.

Glover's Roll, made in 1586, is a copy of a now lost roll dating from even earlier, from the reign of [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] (1216–1272).&lt;ref&gt;[[James Planché|Planché, J.R.]], ''The Pursuivant of Arms; or Heraldry Founded on Facts'', London, 1873, p.30: "Our earliest heraldic information is derived, at present (1852), from a copy made in 1586 by Glover, [[Somerset Herald]], of a roll of arms of the reign of Henry III"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Dering Roll depicts the coats of arms of around a quarter of the English [[baronage]] during the era of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]].&lt;ref name=artfund&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dering Roll|url=http://www.artfund.org/artwork/10300/the-dering-roll|publisher=Artfund|accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasis was given to knights from [[Sussex]] and [[Kent]],&lt;ref name=artfund/&gt; as it was produced in [[Dover]] between 1270 and 1280 and the document was designed to list the knights who owed [[feudal]] service there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrison|first=John|title=Riding to rescue vital record of English medieval knights|url=http://www.mla.gov.uk/news_and_views/press_releases/2008/English-medieval-knights|accessdate=22 May 2011|newspaper=Museums, Libraries &amp; Archives|date=20 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=antiquesgazette&gt;{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Stephanie|title=British Library wins unique key to medieval English heraldry|url=http://www.antiquestradegazette.com/news/6858.aspx|accessdate=22 May 2011|newspaper=Antiques Trade Gazette|date=15 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts 324 [[coats of arms]],&lt;ref name=libraryacquires24&gt;{{cite news|title=British Library Acquires Dering Roll - A Who's Who Of Medieval Arms|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/history+%26+heritage/time/medieval+britain/art60428|accessdate=22 May 2011|newspaper=Culture 24|date=2 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning with [[Richard Fitz Roy]] and [[William de Say]], two of [[John, King of England|King John]]'s illegitimate sons.&lt;ref name=libraryacquires24 /&gt; The shields are arranged in 54 rows, with six shields on each line. Above each shield reads the knight's name, except in six cases where it has been omitted or removed.&lt;ref name=libraryacquires24 /&gt; [[Stephen de Pencester]] may have commissioned the roll during his time as [[Constable of Dover Castle]].&lt;ref name=antiquesgazette /&gt;

==Dering's amendment==
[[Sir Edward Dering, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Dering]] acquired the Roll whilst lieutenant of [[Dover Castle]],&lt;ref name=libraryacquires24 /&gt; and made his modification after 1638, removing the coat of arms of [[Nicholas de Crioll]] and inserting his own coat of arms with a fictitious ancestor named Ric[hard] fi[t]z Dering&lt;ref&gt;British Library, Digitized manuscripts viewer, Add Roll 77720, [http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=add_roll_77720_f001r Image 1], row 11 nos. 1 &amp; 2.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to prove the history of his own family.&lt;ref name=artfund/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Greenstreet and C. Russell, 'The "Dering" Roll of Arms (continued)', ''The Reliquary, Quarterly Archaeological Journal and Review'' (ed. Llewellynn Jewitt), XVI (1875-76), pp. 235-40, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TKxDAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA239#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false at p. 239 &amp; note].&lt;/ref&gt; This appears adjacent to the shield for Thomas de Marines (''or a cross engrailed gules'').&lt;ref&gt;W.S. Ellis, 'Early Kentish Armory', ''Archaeologia Cantiana'' XV (1883), [http://www.kentarchaeology.org.uk/Research/Pub/ArchCant/Vol.015%20-%201883/015-01.pdf pp. 1-30], at p. 9 &amp; note.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The trail of Richard fitz Dering (built upon sources dependent upon Dering's collections) leads, or was intended to lead, to the manor of Heyton in [[Stanford, Kent]] (where the connection with the family of Marinis was mentioned by [[Edward Hasted]]&lt;ref&gt;E. Hasted, 'Parishes: Stanford', in ''The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent'', Vol. 8 (Canterbury, 1799), [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-kent/vol8/pp63-78 pp. 63-78] (British History Online, accessed 11 October 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;), and exemplified by charters like that in [[Thomas Willement]]'s hands.&lt;ref&gt;T. Willement, ''Heraldic Notices of Canterbury Cathedral with Genealogical and Topographical Notes'' (Harding, Lepard &amp; Co, London 1827), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=I4NPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 106, no. 351, and note 'k'].&lt;/ref&gt; A descent through a branch of the [[Nicholas Haute|de Haute family]] of Wadenhall, [[Waltham, Kent]] was then indicated, but Sir Edward Dering's constructive approach to genealogy leaves many of the sources bedevilled by doubts of authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;O.D. Harris, 'Lines of Descent: Appropriations of Ancestry in Stone and Parchment', in T. Rist and A. Gordon (eds), ''The arts of remembrance in early modern England: memorial cultures of the post-Reformation" (Routledge, London 2016), pp. 85-104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.H. D’Elboux, 'The Dering Brasses,' ''The Antiquaries Journal'' XXVII (1947), 11–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent ownership==
During the 20th century it was acquired by Sir [[Anthony Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Denhold-Young|first=Noël|title=History and heraldry, 1254 to 1310|year=1965|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 December 2007, the roll was sold at auction at [[Sotheby's]] for the sum of £192,000 to a private individual who subsequently applied for an export licence.&lt;ref name=antiquesgazette /&gt; The [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] placed a temporary block on the roll being moved overseas and the [[British Library]] led efforts to purchase it,&lt;ref name=collegeapril08&gt;{{cite web|title=Newsletter April 2008|url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/Newsletter/016.htm|publisher=College of Arms|accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art]] confirmed it to be of sufficient importance and significance.&lt;ref name=antiquesgazette /&gt; The library raised £194,184 to acquire the roll; the Head of Medieval and Earlier Manuscripts, Claire Breay said of the purchase, "the acquisition of the Dering Roll provides an extremely rare chance to add a manuscript of enormous local and national significance."&lt;ref name=libraryacquires24 /&gt; They were assisted in funding the purchase from [[The Art Fund]] (£40,000), the [[National Heritage Memorial Fund]] (£100,000), [[Friends of the British Library]] (£10,000), [[Friends of the National Libraries]] (£10,000), and a number of individual benefactors.&lt;ref name=antiquesgazette /&gt; It is now on display at the Sir John Ritblat Gallery in the British Library,&lt;ref name=libraryacquires24 /&gt; and available to researchers in the library's manuscripts reading room.&lt;ref name=antiquesgazette /&gt;

"'''Disabled'''" is a [[war poem]] by [[Wilfred Owen]] written in 1917. It expresses the tormented thoughts and recollections of a teenaged soldier in [[World War I]] who has lost his limbs in battle and is now confined to a wheelchair. The subject contrasts the predicament he is now in with the youthful pleasures he had enjoyed "before he threw away his knees". He recalls the impetuous circumstances in which he enlisted, notes how the crowds that greeted his return were smaller and less enthusiastic than those who cheered his departure, and laments how women no longer look at him but at "the strong men who were whole".

[[Image:Electronic-disturbance-theater.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Electronic Disturbance Theater 2.0, photo by Kinsee Morlan]]
The '''Electronic Disturbance Theater''' ('''EDT'''), established in 1997 by [[performance artist]] and writer [[Ricardo Dominguez (professor)|Ricardo Dominguez]], is an electronic company of cyber activists, critical theorists, and performance artists who engage in the development of both the theory and practice of non-violent acts of defiance across and between digital and non-digital spaces. [[Ricardo Dominguez (professor)|Ricardo Dominguez]], Brett Stalbaum, Stefan Wray, and Carmin Karasic collectively form EDT.  Taking the idea of the American [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1960s, the EDT members have always used their real names.  As a collective group they organize and program [[computer software]] to show their views against anti-propagandist and [[military]] actions, and begin mobilizing micronetworks to act in solidarity by staging [[virtual sit-ins]] online and allowing the emergence of a collective presence in direct digital actions.

==Background==
The EDT created a program called [[FloodNet]] to allow [[electronic civil disobedience]] (ECD). This was a form of [[hacktivism]] which would help create the simulation of a [[sit-in]] protest over the [[Internet]] simply known as a [[virtual sit-in]] demonstration to disrupt Zapatista oppressors' websites, by overloading their [[computer networks]] and [[Server (computing)|servers]].  The Electronic Disturbance Theater group believe that the Internet should not be used purely as a means for [[communication]] and [[data exchange]]; it is also a forum for direct action.

==Electronic Disturbance Theater 2.0==
Current active members of the Electronic Disturbance Theater, who refer to themselves as Electronic Disturbance Theater 2.0,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.digicult.it/it/digimag/issue-062/no-borders-struggles-the-electronic-disturbance-theatre-2-0/ |title=Lotte senza confini. l'electronic disturbance theatre 2.0 |trans-title=Struggle Without Borders: The Electronic Disturbance Theater 2.0 |publisher=Digimag |number=62 |first=Micha |last=Cardenas |language=Italian |date=March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; include Brett Stalbaum, Amy Sara Carroll, [[Elle Mehrmand]], [[Micha Cárdenas]], and [[Ricardo Dominguez (professor)]]. 

The group has received a storm of media attention for their 2007 project, the ''Transborder Immigrant Tool'' (TBT), which sends experimental poetry to users in addition to helping them find water and safe routes when crossing the [[Mexican American border|Mexican-American border]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arte-util.org/projects/transborder-immigrant-tool/|title=Arte Útil  / Transborder Immigrant Tool|website=www.arte-util.org|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; EDT have described this project as the next step of electronic civil disobedience, or ECD 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdcitybeat.com/sandiego/article-8159-after-the-storm.html |title=After the Storm |publisher=San Diego CityBeat |first=Kinsee |last=Morlan |date=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Transborder Immigrant Tool was shown in numerous museums and galleries in 2010, including the California Biennial at the [[Orange County Museum of Art]], the [[Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego]], and the [[Galería de la Raza]] in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocma.net/index.html?page=past&amp;show=exhibit&amp;e_id=3126 |title=2010 California Biennial |publisher=Orange County Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcasd.org/press/artists-announced-here-not-there-san-diego-art-now-exhibition-–-opens-june-6-2010-museum-conte |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804112913/http://www.mcasd.org/press/artists-announced-here-not-there-san-diego-art-now-exhibition-%E2%80%93-opens-june-6-2010-museum-conte |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 4, 2012 |title=Artists announced for Here not there: San Diego art now exhibition – opens june 6, 2010, at Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego in La Jolla |publisher=Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego |date=April 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.galeriadelaraza.org/eng/events/index.php?op=view&amp;id=2418 |title=Transborder Immigrant Tool |publisher=Galeria de la Raza}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is maintained by [[California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Electronic Disturbance Theater is currently under investigation for their [[virtual sit-in]] in support of the 2010 March 4 strikes and occupations in support of public education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/04/09/virtual_protest_as_ddos/ |title='Virtual sit-in' tests line between DDoS and free speech |publisher=The Register |first=Dan |last=Goodin |date=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==FloodNet==
[[File:Screenshot_of_Electronic_Disturbance_Theater_Floodnet_from_September_9th_1998.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Floodnet software, September 9th, 1998]]
The group's objective was, with the use of [[digital media]] and internet based [[technology]], to demonstrate [[nonviolent resistance]] in support of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebels residing in the state of [[Chiapas]] in [[Mexico]]. EDT uses both [[e-mail]] and the Internet to promote their work around the world, encouraging fellow supporters to [[download]] and run a tool based on [[HTML]] (Hyper Text Makeup Language) and [[Java applet]] (an internet program used to help support interactive web-based features or programs that a HTML cannot provide alone) called FloodNet.  FloodNet is a computer-based program, created by members of the Electronic Disturbance theater company [http://www.carminka.net/ Carmin Karasic] and Brett Stalbaum.&lt;ref name="Forbes_Floodnet"/&gt;

The FloodNet program would simply reload a [[URL]] for short several times, effectively slowing the [[website]] and [[network server]] down (a [[DDOS attack]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yourdictionary.com/floodnet&lt;/ref&gt; if a high number of [[protest]]ers were to join in the [[sit-in]] at one time. The EDT would first execute the FloodNet [[software]] in what would be for them a [[dress rehearsal]] before attacking their main targets on April 10, 1998, and a month later, on both Mexican and American government websites, representing both the Mexican President [[Ernesto Zedillo]] and American President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref name="Wired_Floodnet" /&gt;

FloodNet would work on this basic idea taken from street theater practices and political rallies and protest, but instead present it on a much larger and international stage, with the facilitation of macro-networks and non-digital forms of action.

The EDT's mission was to allow the voices of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation to be heard, after the attack on the small remote village of [[Acteal]] in Chiapas, Mexico. The [[Paramilitary]], a government-funded military squad, surrounded a [[Catholic church]] during a Tsotsil Mayan (a spoken Mexican language from around the Chiapas area of Mexico). For the next several hours the Paramilitary shot everyone to death, those inside the church and any who tried to escape, resulting in the death of fifteen children, nine men, and twenty-one women, four of whom were pregnant, on December 22, 1997. This event became known as the [[Acteal Massacre]]. Those who were convicted of this crime were later released in the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] to the outrage of many, after ignoring eyewitness reports and allowing those who confessed to this crime on humanity. Instead, the Supreme Court focused on the mismanagement of the investigation and the fabrication of evidence.

The Electronic Disturbance Theater took notice of these actions when others did not and arranged their first act of electronic civil disobedience against the [[Mexican Government]]. In a subsequent version of FloodNet, those who had [[download]]ed the FloodNet [[Computer program|program]] in support of the Zapatistas were asked to repeatedly input the names of those that had lost their lives at the hands of the Mexican Army in military attacks.  This would then target the [[Server (computing)|servers]] to return an error message each time these URLs would be requested.  This data request would be stored in a [[server log|server's error log]] and in the eyes of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and the Electronic Disturbance Theater group, a symbolic list of those 45 Acteal civilians who had died straight to their [[murder]]ers.  If enough people used the FloodNet [[applet]], this would cause the computer server running the website to overload, so that when a regular visitor or someone working within the site tried to access the website or send company based [[email]]s and files, the pages would either load extremely slowly or not at all.  This worked on the same basis of a real sit-in demonstration, where the [[protester]]s block the entrance to a public building of their oppressors and preventing access to the building.

With around 25% of the world's population in one way or another connected to the [[World Wide Web]], with the use of dial-up internet connection, wired or wireless internet [[broadband]] connection and even [[mobile internet]] technology, every one of these means of [[communication]] can allow the internet to be used as a means of non-violent action within [[human rights]], and is viewable around the world, and can be translated into different languages but most importantly not controlled by the [[government]].  The EDT networked performances have already opened access and communication between three unlikely micro-networks: [[net.art]], net.activism, and net.hackers. With technology always evolving there is no telling how these areas will grow.

However, on June 10, 1998, the EDT struck the Mexican Secretaria de Gobernacion (Secretary of Government), which is involved in [[immigration policies]] as well as Mexico's federal public security forces working in conjunction with the [[military]] Zapatista communities in Chiapas unsuccessfully.  The Mexican government would have a [[program (machine)|program]]med [[countermeasure]] in place. This is what the EDT believe took place.  A countermeasure built into the operating [[JavaScript]] was placed in the [[Secretaria de Gobernacion]]'s website that was designed to activate whenever FloodNet was directed toward its servers.  Upon activation, the website would open window after window on the FloodNet user's [[Internet browser]]. If the FloodNet user remained connected long enough, their browser, whether it is [[Netscape]] or [[Internet Explorer]], could crash the activist's computer, forcing the activist to reboot their system and stopping the FloodNet program at the source.  The EDT has since dealt with both the Mexican government both online and offline and the [[United States Department of Defense]], which has now inserted a [[counter attack]] system into their internet browser-based coding to prevent any more FloodNet-based attacks to the system and server.

The FloodNet system was used again against the [[World Trade Organization]] in 1999, where the group would release their online civil disobedience software to the public under the name "Disturbance Development's Kit".

==Cyber terrorism?==
{{tone|date=August 2015}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
The Electronic Disturbance Theater has been, and is likely to remain, a heated topic of debate within its areas of activity such as: [[political]] up rise, civil disobedience, [[hacktivism]], and acts which cave been called [[cyber terrorism]].  The FloodNet program enables protesters to voice their grievances in a non-violent sit-in style, without having to attend protests and rallies in person. Additionally FloodNet incorporated Usernames which allowed protesters to be protected from potential retaliation, as their real names did not have to be used. There are those who have criticized that FloodNet constitutes an inappropriate use of [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] which impinges upon the right of those affected to use the internet which those same detractors claim should be free for anyone to use despite [[political views]]. A particular example of FloodNet detractors is [[The Virtual Republic]], their representatives view EDT's blockage of both [[communications]] and [[data]] as an act of cyber terrorism.  [[The Virtual Republic]] believes the system should be open for all internet users, and should be accessible with a simple point-and-click, furthermore it is their opinion that those individuals or groups which might impede the free access to internet resources should be [[banned]].  Protesters are asked to [[protest]] outside of their oppressors' physical location by means which will not affect the business conducted within. Representatives of The Virtual Republic have further opined that actions of the EDT are nothing more than [[agit-prop]] and act only to block data in the struggle for the development of [[democracy]] and human rights.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5606">'''Employee experience design''' ('''EED or EXD''') is the application of [[experience design]] in order to intentionally designing [[Human resources|HR]] products, services, events, and organizational environments with a focus on the quality of the employee [[experience]] and organizationally relevant solutions.

==Overview==

EED can be described as the "intentional design of the active or passive use of HR products or services",&lt;ref name="Menzel-Black &amp; Völkl"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Menzel-Black, C.|author2=Völkl, C.|title=Nach Bedarf designt|journal=Personalmagazin|year=2014|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christin_Menzel/publication/264310054_Nach_Bedarf_designt/links/53d7f23a0cf2631430bfdcad?ev=pub_ext_doc_dl&amp;origin=publication_detail&amp;inViewer=true|doi=10.13140/2.1.3054.4001|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and employee experiences in general, that affect employees' emotional reaction and therefore their particular behaviors and loyalty.&lt;ref name="Pullmann &amp; Gross"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pullman, M. E.|author2=Gross, M. A.|year=2014|title=Ability of Experience Design Elements to Elicit Emotions and Loyalty Behaviors|journal=Decision Sciences|volume=35|issue=3|pages=551–578|doi=10.1111/j.0011-7315.2004.02611.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0011-7315.2004.02611.x/full|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The underlying assumption is that best (customer/employee) relationships are emotional in nature and achieved when companies succeed in not only satisfying certain needs (e.g. compensation), but also making interactions pleasurable.&lt;ref name="Pullmann &amp; Gross"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pine &amp; Gilmore"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pine, J.|author2=Gilmore, J.|title=The Experience Economy|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston|year=1998|url=http://hbr.org/1998/07/welcome-to-the-experience-economy/|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal is to yield better [[customer experience]] through increased [[employee engagement]] and employee [[empowerment]].&lt;ref name="Ramaswamy"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ramaswamy, V.|year=2009|title=Leading the transformation to co‐creation of value|journal=Strategy &amp; Leadership|volume=37|issue=2|pages=32–37|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/10878570910941208|doi=10.1108/10878570910941208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Krippendorf, EED focuses on creating meaningful and sense-making opportunities for engagement,&lt;ref name="Krippendorf"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Krippendorff, K.|year=1989|title=On the essential contexts of artifacts or on the proposition that" design is making sense (of things)|journal=Design Issues|volume=5|number=2|pages=9–39|jstor=1511512|doi=10.2307/1511512}}&lt;/ref&gt; and addressing aspirational &lt;ref name="Ramaswamy" /&gt; and fundamental psychological needs of an employee, such as autonomy, competence and relatedness.&lt;ref name="Sheldon"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sheldon, K. M.|author2=Elliot, A. J.|author3=Kim, Y.|author4=Kasser, T.|year=2001|title=What is satisfying about satisfying events? Testing 10 candidate psychological needs|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=80|issue=2|page=325|pmid=11220449|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.2.325|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

Related to [[design strategy]], EED is a participatory systems approach to workplace improvements that applies methods and principles of [[experience design]], such as [[design thinking]], [[co-creation]] and [[empathic design]].&lt;ref name="Menzel-Black &amp; Völkl" /&gt; It also uses tools and techniques that are typical to [[customer experience management]] and [[service design]], e.g. employee experience journey mapping&lt;ref name="Oracle"&gt;{{cite web|author=Oracle Human Capital Management|year=2014|title=An Employee Centric Approach To HR – Employee Experience Journey Mapping (EXJM)|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/employee-centric-hr-2203095.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[touchpoint]] analysis.

Primary design object is the employee experience, which – when successful – an employee finds unique, memorable and sustainable over time, would want to repeat and build upon, and enthusiastically promotes via word of mouth.&lt;ref name="Pine &amp; Gilmore" /&gt; It is suspected to encourage loyalty by creating an emotional connection through engaging, compelling, and consistent context.&lt;ref name="Pullmann &amp; Gross" /&gt; The categories for employee experience design context are products, processes, artefacts, content, space and interactions.&lt;ref name="Menzel-Black &amp; Völkl" /&gt;

==Stakeholders==
[[Human resource management]], operating across hierarchies and departments, plays a central role in design, distribution and delivery of EED. As co-creation is an important design principle, it is a shared task and joint responsibility of leadership, HR professionals and employees.&lt;ref name="Menzel-Black &amp; Völkl" /&gt; Following the logic of the [[service-profit chain]], beneficiaries are also customers, as the recipients of improved service quality and the organization itself through increased profits.&lt;ref name="Heskett"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Heskett, J. L.|author2=Schlesinger, L. A. |year=1994|title=Putting the service-profit chain to work|journal=Harvard Business Review|volume=72|issue=2|pages=164–174|url=http://www.tgli.cl/students/intranet/content/Lecturas/Putting%20the%20Service-Profit%20Cahin%20to%20work.pdf|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film opens with the death of the last [[Malabar Jews|Malabar Jew]] in [[Kochi]]. An antique seller steals a [[Dybbuk box]] with Jewish inscriptions from his house. Upon opening it, a [[dybbuk]] from the box kills the thief.

Meanwhile, Ranjan Mathew ([[Prithviraj Sukumaran]]), a nuclear waste management specialist based in Mumbai, moves to Kerala due to work obligations, along with his wife Priya Raghuram ([[Priya Anand]]). Being a Marathi-Malayali, Priya finds it hard to adjust with the shift from Mumbai to Kerala. On a [[retail therapy]], Priya buys the box from the antique shop. Upon opening it, paranormal activities are experienced by Ranjan and Priya.

Ranjan is an orphan who was living with his mother's brother Fr. Samuel ([[Vijayaraghavan (actor)|Vijayaraghavan]]). Samuel is invited to Ranjan's house. Samuel feels that something is amiss and he tells Ranjan that the box from the antique shop is a [[Dybbuk]]. Ranjan finds more about the Dybbuk from a [[Rabbi]] David Benyamin ([[Babu Antony]]). He tells Ranjan that the Dybbuk only possesses people without mental stability or children under 3 years. The next day, Rabbi Benyamin is dead and Ranjan finds that Priya is pregnant. He comes to the conclusion that his child is possessed. Ranjan finds more about the Dybbuk in his house with the help of Rabbi Marques (Rabbi Benyamin's son) ([[Sujith Shankar]]).

They get to know about a story in 1941 Thiru-Kochi. The story revolves around a Rich Jewish boy Abraham Ezra ([[Sudev Nair]]) and a poor Christian girl Rosy (Ann Sheetal) and their relationship. They both meet up daily in the villages and river banks and their relationship develop into a serious stage when Ezra gifts her a wedding gown which worn by Jewish bride and promises her to never leave her alone and marry her and they end up having passionate sexual intercourse and eventually Rosy got pregnant. Rosy was not ready to accept the reality and had a fear of losing Ezra from her life, since they both belong to different religions. One day Rosy makes Ezra to promise in the name of Jesus that he would never leave her alone and marry her even if their family oppose. Rosy was not able to tell Ezra that she was pregnant. So once Ezra wanted to leave to [[Kochi]], he decided to tell his father about his relationship  with Rosy so that he can convince Rosy's parents too.

Ezra's father refuses his wish to marry Rosy, since they belong to Jewish community and they marry only a Jewish girl. Ezra is forced to break up with Rosy by his father. Without knowing this, Rosy awaits Ezra to comeback. Months later Rosy showed up signs of pregnancy and she is caught by her mother.  Her parents tried to make her understand the situation and asked her to tell who's child was she carrying, but Rosy trusted Ezra and was not ready to betray him so she remain silent and she is locked up in a room by her parents. Without knowing all this conflicts, months later,  depressed Ezra writes a letter to Rosy telling her to end their relationships and erase him from her life. In sorrow Rosy commit suicide by wearing the wedding gown which was gifted by Ezra to show that she still love him. Later Rosy's father find the letter which was send by Ezra to Rosy and finds that they were in a relationship. He went to meet Ezra and his father. However, he was killed by Ezra and his father. The villagers tried to hit Ezra and they attempted to kill him. Ezra was seriously injured and he was taken to the hospital by his father.

The doctors confirms that he is [[brain dead]] . Ezra's father decides to take revenge on the people of the society. Ezra's father purposefully kills him to create Dybbuk. Instead of seeing his son in a brain-dead condition, he invoked black magic and made his son's soul enter into a Dybbuk box. The box was created in such a way that the spirit would destroy the entire community who killed Ezra. He let the others know that Ezra had died and they then buried Ezra's body, which was really a wooden dummy. For the spirit of Ezra to become a Dybbuk, his body could not be given a proper burial. Ezra's father then took Ezra's body, which was wrapped in a cloth, to the sea and dumped it.

The story comes back to Ranjan. Marques wants the Dybbuk to leave Ranjan and his family. So with the help of A.C.P Shafeer Ahammed ([[Tovino Thomas]]), he confirms that Abraham Ezra's story is true. Finally, he decides to exorcise the Dybbuk. But, it is revealed that it is not Priya, but Ranjan whom the spirit of Ezra has possessed. Fr. Samuel tell them that Ranjan, as orphan had mental problems in his childhood and because Ranjan is a nuclear waste management specialist, the Dybbuk would be easily able to destroy the society. At last, Ranjan is exorcised but failed. Marques along with other Jews try to control Ezra but Priya is trapped under Ezra but then suddenly looking at pregnant Priya, Ezra remembers Rosy and his love towards her made him to leave Priya. Finally the dybbuk who is uncontrollable is made to enter the box by Marques. The box is then taken to an ocean by Marues and Shafeer and dumped exactly like Ezra'a body was dumped.

Later, Priya gives birth to a healthy baby and she and Ranjan are sharing their happy news with Marques. In a mid credit scene, it is shown that the Dybbuk box is found by some young men who were loafing about the sea shore. The film end by them taking the box with them planning to open it.

===Critical reception===

K R Rajeesh of nowrunning has given a 3/5 and praised it for the extensive paranormal research and visuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nowrunning.com/movie/18533/malayalam/ezra/5720/review/ "Ezra Review – Malayalam Movie Ezra nowrunning review"]. ''nowrunning.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Indian Express rated it at 2/5. Ezra not only tries to frighten the audience but it has got an extraordinary stroryline too.
It also tells the history of the Jews  who once lived in Kerala. The remarkable flashback stays as a sorrow in the audiences. It describes how the caste system and discrimination of the society spoils the relationships between people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/ezra-movie-review-a-film-with-infinite-possibilities-cast-away-like-a-corpse-in-the-sea-4518264/ "Ezra movie review: A film with infinite possibilities cast away like a corpse in the sea"]. ''indianexpress.com''. 10 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music ==
[[Rahul Raj]] was signed as the composer of the film. He composed the song ''Lailakame'' and left the project for  reasons unknown. Sushin Shyam, who had worked in ''Sapthmashree Thaskaraha'' was then selected to compose the background score in addition to two songs ("Thambiran" &amp; "Irul Neelum").

The song ''Lailakame'' became a smash hit,&lt;ref&gt;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/malayalam/music/rahul-rajs-cover-for-lailakame-from-ezra-goes-viral/articleshow/57603535.cms&lt;/ref&gt; prompting several cover versions, including one by Rahul Raj himself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8063">'''Famous People Players''' is a [[black light puppet]]ry theatre company. It is based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada and tours worldwide. It is a [[non-profit organization]] which employs people with physical and intellectual disabilities. Those individuals share duties in dining room management, arts administration, and theatrical and visual arts performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Famous PEOPLE Players Dine &amp; Dream Theatre|url=http://www.seetorontonow.com/listings/famous-people-players-dine-dream-theatre/|website=See Toronto|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since inception, the company has paid homage to the works of famous people within its own theatrical context, hence the name '''''Famous People'' Players'''.

==History==
The Famous People Players was founded on June 1, 1974, by Diane Dupuy of [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. At inception, the company consisted of Dupuy and an assistant, eleven performers, and Dupuy's mother Mary Thornton; Thornton designed and built the costumes and props.

The company's original piece was ''Aruba Liberace'', in which a life-size character of [[Liberace]] plays the piano. It is still the company's signature performance. Liberace attended a showing of ''Aruba Liberace'', and was so impressed he invited Famous People Players to perform with him in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. The company debuted in Las Vegas in October 1975; over the subsequent ten years, the company performed with Liberace both in Las Vegas and internationally.

As a result of the increasing popularity of Famous People Players, the company was featured as regulars on [[CBC Television]]'s 1976-1977 variety series, ''[[The Wolfman Jack Show]]''; the network also later produced and aired ''Carnival of the Animals''. In 1980, ''Sorcerer Apprentice'' premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York. In 1982, Famous People Players was invited to perform in the [[People's Republic of China]]. The company's first Broadway Show, ''A Little Like Magic'', opened at the Lyceum Theatre in New York City and ran for 49 performances in 1985.&lt;ref name="PlaybillVault"&gt;[http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/7116/A-Little-Like-Magic Playbill Vault: A Little Like Magic], accessed April 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; They returned to New York in 1994 for a 4 week run, under the sponsorship of Phil Collins and actor Paul Newman, where they performed the show ''A Little More Magic'' for inner city kids to dream BIG!&lt;ref name="PlaybillVault"/&gt;

==Dine and Dream Theatre==
In 1994, the company opened the '''Dine and Dream Theatre'''; [[Paul Newman]] funded the restaurant's development from some of the proceeds of [[Newman's Own]] products and [[Phil Collins]] funded the theatre's [[Sound reinforcement system|sound system]]. In 2009, facing the demolition of its 25-year location, the company moved further west to a new location. Despite damage caused by storms and unexpected costs from the city of Toronto, the company survived and opened its first show in its new location on October 23, 2009.

The '''Dine and Dream Theatre''' is located at the company's Toronto west-end headquarters. Guests first arrive to the restaurant for dinner, where they are served by individuals who also perform in Famous People Players productions. After dinner, they are led to the '''Phil Collins Theatre''', where the main production is performed. The theatre is named after [[Phil Collins]], who became a source of inspiration for the actors when he viewed a performance interpretation of his music. It is currently the only theatre in Canada exclusively devoted to puppetry performance.

==Recognition==
The troupe has been subject of numerous talk shows, specials and documentaries. A 1984 [[CBS]] movie-of-the-week entitled ''Special People'' was based on the company's early history. ''A Little Like Magic'', which detailed the company's operation and success, was an [[Emmy Award]]-winning documentary. The company was also featured in the plot of an episode of the popular U.S. television drama ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'' in 2002.

In co-production with Treehouse's "Roll Play" Famous PEOPLE Players program for the juice box set {{Clarify|date=February 2009}} is hugely popular.  The theatre troupe first broke into this market with their Toronto Dinner Theatre as a guest spot location for Treehouse kingpin "This is Daniel Cook."

Founder Diane Dupuy has been inducted as a member of the [[Order of Canada]] in recognition for her contributions to Canadian society through the company and mother Mary C. Thornton has won many accolades, most recently with The Toastmasters as woman of the year.

==Productions==
Famous People Players has created many productions over its 30-year history. (''Note: The table below is currently incomplete.'')

''Leave the Porch Light On'' was the company's first original, full-length musical production and was created for the company's 25th-anniversary. The initial performance of ''Leave the Porchlight On'' was attended by a number of celebrities and other well-known people, including the [[Governor General of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&amp;DocID=66 Governor General of Canada: Opening Performance of "Leave the Porch light On" -- the 25th Anniversary Production of the Famous People Players]&lt;/ref&gt; The production was very successful and is still occasionally performed at the company's theatre in Toronto and on tour. A sequel of sorts followed two years later, entitled ''Hide and Seek: A Game of Human Spirit''.

'''''Female Trouble''''' is a 1974 [[dark comedy]] film co-composed, filmed, co-edited, written, produced, and directed by [[John Waters]] and starring [[Divine (performer)|Divine]], [[David Lochary]], [[Mary Vivian Pearce]], [[Mink Stole]], [[Edith Massey]], Michael Potter, [[Cookie Mueller]], and [[Susan Walsh (actress)|Susan Walsh]].

The film is dedicated to [[Manson Family]] member [[Charles "Tex" Watson]]. Waters' prison visits to Watson inspired the "crime is beauty" theme of the film and  in the film's opening credits, Waters includes a wooden toy helicopter that Watson made for him.

==Plot==
Dawn Davenport, a delinquent high-school student, goes berserk when her parents refuse to buy her the shoes she wants for Christmas because "nice girls don't wear cha-cha heels": she destroys presents, topples a Christmas tree on her mother, and flees the house. Dawn hitchhikes a ride with a lecherous man, Earl Peterson, who drives her to a dump where they have sex on a discarded mattress. Dawn becomes pregnant, but Earl refuses to support her. She gives birth to a daughter, Taffy, a brattish child often beaten and severely punished by her mother. Dawn works various jobs, including stripping and waiting tables, and engages in criminal activities such as burglary and street prostitution with former high-school friends Chiclette and Concetta.

Dawn begins frequenting the Lipstick Beauty Salon and marries Gater Nelson, her hair stylist and next-door neighbor. Donald and Donna Dasher, the fascist owners of the beauty salon, recruit Dawn in a scheme to prove "crime and beauty are the same". They entice Dawn to commit crimes by promising her fame, supplying her with drugs and money, and photographing her crimes to stoke her vanity.

Gater's aunt, Ida Nelson, is distraught over her nephew's marriage because she hopes he will "turn nelly" and take a male lover. When the marriage fails, Dawn persuades the Dashers to fire Gater, who moves to Detroit to work in the auto industry. Ida blames Dawn for driving Gater away and exacts revenge by [[acid attack|throwing acid in her face]], leaving Dawn hideously disfigured. The Dashers discourage Dawn from having corrective cosmetic surgery and use her as a grotesquely made-up model. They kidnap Ida, imprison her in a large birdcage in Dawn's apartment, and give Dawn an axe to chop off her hand as revenge for the acid attack.

Taffy, now a teenager, is distressed by her mother's criminal lifestyle and convinces her to reveal the identity of her father. Taffy finds her father living in squalor and drinking excessively. She stabs him to death with a butcher knife after he tries to sexually assault her. Taffy returns home, falsely claims she was unable to locate her father, and announces she is joining the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] movement. Dawn warns her she will kill her if she does.

Dawn, now with bizarre hair, make-up, and outfits provided by the Dashers, mounts a nightclub act. When Taffy appears backstage chanting mantras in religious attire, Dawn fulfills her threat and strangles her to death. Dawn brandishes a gun onstage during her nightclub act and begins firing into the crowd, wounding and killing several audience members. When police arrive to ostensibly subdue the crowd, they shoot several audience members themselves. However, they allow the Dashers to leave when they claim to be upright citizens caught in a bloody rampage. Dawn flees into a forest, but is soon arrested by the police and put on trial for murder.

At the trial, the judge grants the Dashers immunity from prosecution for testifying against Dawn. The Dashers feign innocence and completely blame Dawn for the crimes she committed at their behest; they also pay Ida to lie on the witness stand. Although Dawn pleads not guilty by reason of insanity, the jury finds her guilty and sentences her to die in the [[electric chair]]. Before Dawn is executed, she and a female prisoner kiss and fondle each other. As the priest says a prayer and Dawn is strapped to the electric chair, she thanks her fans for making her infamous before being electrocuted.

==Theme song==
The lyrics to the [[Theme song|title song]], sung by [[Divine (performer)|Divine]], were written by [[John Waters|Waters]] and set to a pre-existing piece of music.

==Production notes==
* The unique [[production design]] is by [[Dreamlanders|Dreamlander]] [[Vincent Peranio]], who created Dawn's apartment in a condemned suite above a friend's store. 
* Waters explained in a 2015 interview&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3M-t64qkD8|title=John Waters: on stage with the ‘Pope of Trash’|first=|last=BFI|date=September 28, 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Dawn Davenport's look was based on the woman in the famous 1966 [[Diane Arbus]] photograph  of a young Brooklyn family on a Sunday outing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americansuburbx.com/2013/06/diane-arbus-arbuss-box-of-ten-photographs.html|title=DIANE ARBUS: "Arbus’s Box of Ten Photographs" (2003)|date=June 12, 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Divine chose to perform his own stunts, the most difficult of which involved doing flips on a trampoline during his nightclub act. Waters took Divine to a [[YMCA]], where he took lessons until the act was perfected. Divine also nailed a difficult outdoor stunt involving sleet and rain, to the point where he did the athletic stunt without his wig being dislodged.
* The birth scene was saved until the end of shooting, when [[Dreamlanders|Dreamlander]] Susan Lowe gave birth to a son and agreed to Waters' request that they film her son as Dawn's baby. The [[umbilical cord]] was fashioned out of [[Condom|prophylactics]] filled with [[liver]], while the baby (Ramsey McLean) was doused in fake blood. The scene created quite a scandal for Lowe's mother-in-law, who arrived on the set in a state of confusion.&lt;ref name="FemaleTrouble DVD Special Ed"&gt;{{cite video|people=John Waters|date=2004|title=FemaleTrouble DVD Special Ed.|url=|format=DVD|medium=|publisher=New Line Cinema}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although Dawn Davenport was [[Capital punishment|executed]] at the end of the film, [[Capital punishment in the United States|US capital punishment]] was suspended from 1972 to 1976 due to the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]''. [[Maryland]] did not formally reinstate capital punishment until July 1, 1975 (coincidentally, just 24 hours before John Waters had a "special sneak preview" of the film at a state prison where he did volunteer creative writing classes for inmates) and its constitutionality was not affirmed until 1976. Furthermore, [[asphyxiation]] in the [[gas chamber]] was the authorized method of execution, not [[Electric chair|electrocution]]. In the film, the jury pronounces Dawn's sentence, an act typically performed by a judge in actual court cases.
* On the 2004 DVD Director's Special Comments, Waters states that the original working title of the film was "''Rotten Mind, Rotten Face''".&lt;ref name="FemaleTrouble DVD Special Ed"/&gt; He changed it because he did not want to leave the door open for hostile film critics to refer to his film as "rotten".

==Reception==
The film has an 87% "Fresh" rating on review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 23 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|female_trouble|Female Trouble}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Where do these people come from? Where do they go when the sun goes down? Isn't there a law or something?&lt;br /&gt;— [[Rex Reed]]&lt;ref name="FemaleTrouble DVD Special Ed"/&gt;}}

==Alternate versions==
The initial [[16 mm film|16mm]] release of the film which was shown at colleges ran 92 minutes. However, when the film was blown up to [[35 mm film|35mm]] and shown theatrically, it was cut to 89 minutes. This version was the only version seen in the United States for many years. However, a recent restoration was done of the original cut, which runs 97 minutes; it has played at this 97-minute length in Europe, however, since its initial release.

The 97-minute version was shown only in select theaters and was included in an out-of-print DVD set paired with ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (''Female Trouble'' is still available on DVD as a single disc and as part of a DVD [[box set]], ''Very Crudely Yours, John Waters''). This version also has a soundtrack remixed in stereo surround. The 97-minute version contains some additional scenes, including the chase through the woods, as well as an appearance by Sally Turner, the [[Elizabeth Taylor]] look-alike customer in the Lipstick Beauty Salon (Turner served as Divine's [[Body double|double]] in the junkyard sex scene between Dawn Davenport and Earl Peterson).

The film was shown in the 89-minute cut when re-released in 2002.

The 97-minute version is now available on DVD and includes an [[audio commentary]] by Waters.

[[The Criterion Collection]] released a restored version of the film in [[4K resolution|4K]] on DVD and Blu-ray on June 26, 2018.

'''Fierce Pussy''' (also styled '''fierce pussy''') is a lesbian [[feminist art]] activist collective founded in 1991 in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fierce Pussy collection 1991-1994|url=http://archives.nypl.org/mss/995|publisher=New York Public Library|accessdate=December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is committed to art action in association with the [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/art/act-up-new-york-activism-art-and-the-aids-crisis-19871993|title=“ACT UP New York: Activism, Art, and the AIDS Crisis, 1987–1993”|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Susie Y.|title=Re-Act: Presenting visual media from the AIDS activist movement, "ACT UP New York" hopes to spark dialogue on campus|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2009/10/16/up-act-students-aids/|accessdate=7 March 2011|newspaper=[[The Harvard Crimson]]|date=16 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In 1991, a group of [[New York City]] lesbians formed 'fierce pussy' to address issues of lesbian identity and visibility. All of its members were involved in [[ACT UP|AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power]] ([[ACT UP]]) to fight the [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] pandemic. Low-tech and low budget, the collective responded to the urgency of those years, using readily available resources: old typewriters, found photographs, their own baby pictures, and the printing supplies and equipment accessible in their day jobs.

Originally fierce pussy was composed of a fluid and often shifting cadre of dykes including Pam Brandt, [[Jean Carlomusto]], Donna Evans, Alison Froling, and [[Suzanne Wright]]. Many other women came to an occasional meeting, and joined in to [[wheat paste]], stencil and sticker. Since 2008, four of the original core members—Nancy Brooks Brody, Joy Episalla, [[Zoe Leonard]], and Carrie Yamaoka—continue to work together.

One of fierce pussy's more well-known projects was the use of wheat-pasted posters and crack-and-peel stickers that were interspersed throughout [[New York City]].  In addition, their other projects included re-designing the bathroom at the Gay and Lesbian Center, a greeting card campaign, a video public service announcement, a moving billboard truck, and renaming the street signs along the [[LGBT Pride March (New York City)|New York City Gay Pride]] route in 1991 after prominent lesbian heroines.  Since 2008, their work has appeared in various installations and exhibitions in [[New York City]]. Their site specific installation, "For The Record", was part of the exhibit ''Greater New York'' in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://momaps1.org/exhibitions/view/403 Greater New York 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects and exhibits==
While Fierce Pussy was most active between 1991 and 1995, their work is still exhibited as historic examples of AIDS-related art and lesbian-identified art.  From 2008 to 2010 at the [[Lesbian Herstory Archives]], fierce pussy presented an overview of their old work in addition to a new installation entitled ''Mining the Archive, ''in which objects from the archive were utilized.  In addition, fierce pussy contributed their display to the [[White Columns]] featured exhibit ''ACT UP New York: Activism, Art, and the AIDS crisis, 1987-1993''. This exhibition was revived at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kivrak|first=Pelin|author2=Sonia Coman|title=Act Up Revived at Harvard: In the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, ignorance is not bliss|url=http://www.harvardindependent.com/?p=159|accessdate=7 March 2011|newspaper=[[The Harvard Independent]]|date=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the exhibition moved to [[White Columns]], they were commissioned to make the installation called "Get Up Everybody and Sing."  In 2010, fierce pussy created "Get Up Everybody and Sing" for the [[White Columns]] presentation of the ACT UP New York exhibition; in 2015, VisualAIDS made this exhibit available under the name "For the Record".  Fierce pussy has made an overview retrospective of their older work available at [[Printed Matter, Inc|Printed Matter]], which also published the book ''fierce pussy''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11731">The '''Heart of the City''' is a long-term project aiming at the redevelopment of the historic centre of [[Kaliningrad]], the area surrounding the former [[Königsberg Castle]] and the [[House of Soviets (Kaliningrad)|House of Soviets]]. The project implementation unit is a Non-governmental organization Urban Planning Bureau “Heart of the City” (Russian name: Градостроительное бюро «Сердце города»), located in Kaliningrad, [[Russia]].

== About ==

The project emerged as a joint initiative of the members of the [[Ministry of Culture (Russia)|Ministry of Culture]] working under the leadership of the Governor of Kaliningrad Region, [[Nikolay Tsukanov]]. The Ministry of Culture under the Governor of the Kaliningrad Region is an advisory body established in 2005 designed to foster cooperation between cultural institutions, mass media, NGOs, the artistic and cultural community, and to develop proposals on different issues in the sphere of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Background ==
Because of the severe damages during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and uncompleted town planning projects of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, so far, the city centre of Kaliningrad remains virtually empty and undeveloped in terms of urban infrastructure and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, after several years of public and expert consultations held with Russian and foreign experts, the Kaliningrad Oblast Government launched the long-term program for the systematic regeneration of the historical part of the city, which is known for its seven centuries of history as [[Königsberg]] and still preserves some features of its original urban fabric. To implement the project named “Heart of the City”, the “road map” was developed to cover the areas of the King’s Mountain (Korolevskaya gora), the adjacent embankment of the [[Pregolya River]] and the [[Lower Pond (Kaliningrad)|Lower Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
In 2013, the Historic and cultural study of the “Heart of the City” project areas was conducted to set the basis for further activities within the project. The researchers determined the boundaries of twelve historic areas (corresponding to former Königsberg city parts), analysed their historic and cultural assets, and made recommendations for their future development. The study was presented to the local authorities and discussed with professionals and the local community on numerous occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In 2014, the Urban Planning Bureau “Heart of the City” organised and conducted an international architectural and urban planning competition for the Development Concept of  the historic centre of Kaliningrad. The professional jury panel was represented by Bart Goldhoorn, Hans Stimmann, Barbara Engel, Rasmus Waern, Stephen Willacy, Olov Schultz, Alexander Lozhkin and Anna Brunow. The competition intended to find a new concept of the urban planning development of the area called “Korolevskaya Gora“ (Germ. Königsberg) and its surroundings (in total 56 ha). The winner emerging out of this competition was the [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg’s]] team of architects “Studio 44“ in partnership with  St. Petersburg’s Institute of Territorial Development. The winners proposed an individual development scenario that would "take the interplay between heritage and contemporary context to a totally new level."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former [[Altstadt (Königsberg)|Altstadt]] would become a zone of archaeological research with a new medieval city growing on top of the ruined one. The reconstructed historic urban fabric and the strict regulations governing the height and the shape of the buildings, roof-slope angles and the use of finishing materials will generate echoes of something recognizably old-European.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The consolidated planning concept formed the basis for the revisions of the current urban planning documents concerning the historic centre of Kaliningrad and led to a new open international design competition “Post-castle“ that was announced in May 2015. The competition sought to find an architectural image for a Historic and cultural complex on the grounds of the former [[Königsberg Castle]] that will accommodate a multifunctional concert hall, a museum of archaeology, a museum of the King’s castle history and other functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

His design managed to combine all the requirements and particularly impressed the jury with the quality of the draft and the idea of creating several public spaces.&lt;ref&gt;https://issuu.com/antonsagal/docs/another_castle/1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current situation ==
At present, the competition winner has been contracted for a conceptual design of the Historic and cultural complex. The Bureau continues working closely with local authorities to ensure that the results of both competitions are incorporated in the urban planning documents for the project area. The local authorities announced plans to start archaeological excavations on the grounds of the former Königsberg Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[File:Egypte louvre 021.jpg|right|thumbnail|250px|Egyptian scene depicting the preparation of Lily perfume]]

The word ''[[perfume]]''  is used today to describe scented mixtures and is derived from the Latin word, "''per fumus''," meaning ''through smoke''. The word [[Perfumery]] refers to the art of making perfumes. Perfume was further refined by the [[ancient Rome|Romans]], the [[Persian people|Persian]]s and the [[Arab]]s. Although perfume and perfumery also existed in East Asia, much of its fragrances were [[incense]] based. The basic ingredients and methods of making perfumes are described by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his [[Naturalis Historia]].

== Mesopotamia ==

The world's first recorded chemist is a woman named [[Tapputi]], a perfume maker whose existence was recorded on a 1200 BCE [[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablet]] in Babylonian [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Strathern, Paul |title=Mendeleyev's Dream&amp;nbsp;— The Quest For the Elements|location=New York | publisher=Berkley Books|year=2000|isbn=0-425-18467-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; She held a powerful role in the Mesopotamian government and religion, as the overseer of the Mesopotamian Royal Palace. She developed methods for scent extraction techniques that would lay the basis for perfume making. She recorded her techniques and methods and those were passed on, with her most groundbreaking technique in using solvents.&lt;ref&gt; Gabriele Kass-Simon, Patricia Farnes, Deborah Nash, eds. (1999). Women of science : righting the record (First Midland Book ed.). Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana Univ. Press. p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

== India ==

Perfume and perfumery also existed in [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus civilization]], which existed from 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE. One of the earliest distillation of [[Ittar]] was mentioned in the Hindu Ayurvedic text ''[[Charaka Samhita]]'' and ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Agriculture Diversification: Problems and Perspectives|author1=A.K. Sharma|author2= Seema Wahad|author3= Raśmī Śrīvāstava|page=140|publisher=I. K. International Pvt Ltd|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perfume references are part of a larger text called Brihat-Samhita written by [[Varāhamihira]], an Indian astronomer, mathematician, and astrologer living in the city of Ujjain. He was one of the ‘nine jewels’ in the court of the Maharaja of Malwa. The perfume portion mainly deals with the manufacture of perfumes to benefit ‘royal personages and inmates of harems’. The text is written as Sanskrit slokas with commentary by a 10th century Indian commentator Utpala.&lt;ref&gt;https://purplepaperplanes.wordpress.com/2013/08/30/perfume-from-ancient-indian-texts-brihat-samhita/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1975 report, archeologist Dr Paolo Rovesti found a terracotta distillation apparatus in the Indus valley together with oil containers made of the same material, carbon dated to 3000 BCE. The report also states that terracotta vessels with plugged orifices of woven materials were used so that when fragrant plant materials were covered with boiling water the vapours impregnated the material, which was subsequently wrung out to isolate the oil.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Cyprus ==

To date, the oldest perfumery was discovered on the island of [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael | last=Theodoulou | title=Archaeological dig sniffs out world's oldest perfumery | date=25 February 2005 | work =The Scotsman | url =http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=212432005&amp;format=print | accessdate = 19 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations in 2004-2005 under the initiative of an Italian archaeological team unearthed evidence of an enormous factory that existed 4,000 years ago during the [[Prehistory of Cyprus#Bronze Age|Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Tabitha | last=Morgan | title=Bronze Age perfume 'discovered' | date=19 March 2005 | publisher =[[BBC]]| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4364469.stm  | accessdate = 19 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This covered an estimated surface area of over 4,000m² indicating that perfume manufacturing was on an industrial scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Malcolm | last=Moore | title= Eau de BC: the oldest perfume in the world | date=21 March 2007 | work =[[The Daily Telegraph]]| url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/03/21/wperfume21.xml  | accessdate = 23 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The news of this discovery was reported extensively through the world press and many artifacts are already on display in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=John | last=Roach | title=Oldest Perfumes Found on "Aphrodite's Island" | date=29 March 2007 | work =National Geographic News | url =http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/03/070329-oldest-perfumes.html?source=rss | accessdate = 30 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Bible describes a sacred perfume (Exodus 30:22-33) consisting of liquid myrrh, fragrant cinnamon, fragrant cane, and cassia.  Its use was forbidden, except by the priests.
The women wore perfume to present their beauty.

== Islamic ==
{{see also|Alchemy and chemistry in Islam}}

[[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic cultures]] contributed significantly to the development of Western perfumery in two significant areas: perfecting the extraction of fragrances through steam distillation and introducing new raw materials. Both have greatly influenced Western perfumery and [[Science|scientific]] developments, particularly [[chemistry]].

With a rise of Islam, Muslims improved perfume production and continued to use perfumes in daily life and in practicing religion. They used musk, roses and amber, among other materials. As traders, Islamic cultures such as the Arabs and Persians had wider access to a wide array of spices, resins, herbs, precious woods, herbs and animal fragrance materials such as ambergris and musk. In addition to trading, many of the flowers and herbs used in perfumery were cultivated by the Muslims&amp;nbsp;— rose and jasmine were native to the region, and many other plants (i.e.: bitter orange and other citrus trees, all of which imported from China and southeast Asia) could be successfully cultivated in the Middle East, and are to this day key ingredients in perfumery.

In [[Islamic]] culture, perfume usage has been documented as far back as the 6th century and its usage is considered a religious duty. Muhammad said:

{{cquote|''The taking of a bath on Friday is compulsory for every male [[Muslim]] who has attained the age of puberty and (also) the cleaning of his teeth with [[Miswaak]] (type of twig used as a toothbrush), and the using of perfume if it is available.'' (Recorded in [[Sahih Bukhari]]).}}

They often used to blend extracts with the cement of which mosques were built.&lt;ref name="The History of Perfume"&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Perfume|url=http://www.everythinkaboutperfume.com/history.html|website=everythinkaboutperfume.com|accessdate=3 February 2015|language=en|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208043220/http://www.everythinkaboutperfume.com/history.html|archivedate=8 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such rituals gave incentives to scholars to search and develop a cheaper way to produce incenses and in mass production.

Many great discoveries originates from the region in 10th century, the time when the still was invented, and as a consequence of which the distill techniques considerably improved. Thanks to the hard work of two talented [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Arabian chemists]]: [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (Geber, born 722, Iraq), and [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus, born 801, Iraq) who established the perfume industry. Jabir developed many techniques, including distillation, evaporation and filtration, which enabled the collection of the odour of plants into a vapour that could be collected in the form of water or oil.&lt;ref name=Levey&gt;Levey, Martin (1973), "Early Arabic Pharmacology," ''E.J. Brill: Leiden'', {{ISBN|90-04-03796-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Kindi, however, was the real founder of perfume industry as he carried out extensive research and experiments in combining various plants and other sources to produce a variety of scent products. He elaborated a vast number of ‘recipes’ for a wide range of perfumes, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. His work in the laboratory is reported by a witness who said:

{{cquote|''I received the following description, or recipe, from Abu Yusuf Ya'qub b. Ishaq al-Kindi, and I saw him making it and giving it an addition in my presence''.}}

The writer goes on in the same section to speak of the preparation of a perfume called ''ghaliya'', which contained musk, amber and other ingredients; too long to quote here, but which reveals a long list of technical names of drugs and apparatus. Al-Kindi also wrote in the 9th century a book on perfumes which he named ‘''Book of the Chemistry of Perfume and Distillations''’. It contained more than a hundred recipes for fragrant oils, salves, aromatic waters and substitutes or imitations of costly drugs. The book also described one hundred and seven methods and recipes for perfume-making, and even the perfume making equipment, like the alembic, still bears its Arabic name.&lt;ref&gt;al-Hassani, Woodcok and Saoud (2006) 1001 Inventions; Muslim Heritage in Our World, FSTC, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Persian [[Islamic medicine|Muslim doctor]] and chemist [[Avicenna]] (also known as Ibn Sina) introduced the process of extracting oils from [[flowers]] by means of [[distillation]], the procedure most commonly used today. He first experimented with the rose. Until his discovery, liquid perfumes were mixtures of oil and crushed herbs, or petals which made a strong blend. Rose water was more delicate, and immediately became popular. Both of the raw ingredients and distillation technology significantly influenced western perfumery and [[Science|scientific]] developments, particularly [[chemistry]].

Eventually perfume arrived to European courts through [[Al-Andalus]] in the west, and on the other side, with the crusaders in the east. For instance, eggs and floral perfumes were brought to Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries from Arabia, by returning [[crusaders]], through trade with the Islamic world. Those who traded for these were most often also involved in trade for spices and dyestuffs. There are records of the Pepperers Guild of London, going back to 1179; which show them trading with Muslims in spices, perfume ingredients and dyes.&lt;ref name=Dunlop&gt;Dunlop, D.M. (1975), "Arab Civilization," ''Librairie du Liban''&lt;/ref&gt; Catharina de [[Medici]] initiated the perfume industry in Europe when she left Italy in the 16th century to marry the French crown prince.&lt;ref name="The History of Perfume"/&gt;

== Western ==

Knowledge of something perfumery came to [[Europe]] as early as the 14th century due partially to [[Arabic]] influences and knowledge. But it was the [[Hungarians]] who ultimately introduced the first modern perfume. The first modern perfume, made of scented oils blended in an alcohol solution, was made in 1370 at the command of [[Elisabeth of Poland|Queen Elizabeth of Hungary]] and was known throughout [[Europe]] as [[Hungary Water]]. The art of perfumery prospered in [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]], and in the 16th century, Italian refinements were taken to France by [[Catherine de' Medici]]'s personal perfumer, [[Rene le Florentin]]. His laboratory was connected with her apartments by a secret passageway, so that no formulas could be stolen en route.

===France===
[[France]] quickly became the European center of perfume and cosmetic manufacture.  Cultivation of flowers for their perfume essence, which had begun in the 14th century, grew into a major industry in the south of France mainly in [[Grasse]] now considered the world capital of perfume. During the [[Renaissance]] period, perfumes were used primarily by royalty and the wealthy to mask body odors resulting from the sanitary practices of the day. Partly due to this patronage, the western perfumery industry was created.
Perfume enjoyed huge success during the 17th century. [[Perfumed glove]]s became popular in France and in 1656, the guild of glove and perfume-makers was established. Perfumers were also known to create poisons; for instance, a French duchess was murdered when a perfume/poison was rubbed into her gloves and was slowly absorbed into her skin.

Perfume came into its own when [[Louis XV]] came to the throne in the 18th century. His court was called "la cour parfumée" (the perfumed court). [[Madame de Pompadour]] ordered generous supplies of perfume, and King Louis demanded a different fragrance for his apartment every day. The court of Louis XIV was even named due to the scents which were applied daily not only to the skin but also to clothing, fans and furniture. Perfume substituted for soap and water. The use of perfume in France grew steadily. By the 18th century, aromatic plants were being grown in the [[Grasse]] region of France to provide the growing perfume industry with raw materials. Even today, France remains the centre of the European perfume design and [[trade]].

After [[Napoleon]] came to power, exorbitant expenditures for perfume continued. Two quarts of violet cologne were delivered to him each week, and he is said to have used sixty bottles of double extract of [[jasmine]] every month. Josephine had stronger perfume preferences. She was partial to musk, and she used so much that sixty years after her death the scent still lingered in her boudoir.

=== England ===

Perfume use peaked in England during the reigns of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] (reigned 1509-1547) and Queen Elizabeth I (reigned 1558-1603). All public places were scented{{by whom|date=July 2015}} during Queen Elizabeth's rule, since she could not tolerate bad smells.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} It was said that the sharpness of her nose was equaled only by the slyness of her tongue. Ladies of the day took great pride in creating delightful fragrances and they displayed their skill in mixing scents.

As with industry and the arts, perfume underwent profound change in the 19th century. Changing tastes and the development of modern chemistry laid the foundations of modern perfumery as alchemy gave way to chemistry.

Perfume manufacture in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] grew after 1861 and became globally significant by the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;

| quote                 = Russia had begun to modernize its extremely backward economy after the abolition of serfdom in 1861. There was a heavy French presence in many of Russia's new industries [...] including perfume. In 1864 Henri Brocard, the son of a small Parisian perfumer, opened a soap and perfume business in Moscow [...] Brocard expanded a business which sold in the major cities in Russia, and its factory in Moscow made perfumes, soaps, powders, cosmetics, and even dental care products. [...] [T]here is evidence that the leading Russian houses may have been amongst the world's largest perfume companies by the 1900s. Brocard had sales of $500,000 in 1904. Rallet, which sold in the Balkans as well as in Asian countries surrounding Russia, achieved sales of 50 million francs, or nearly $10 million, by 1914.

'''Innovation''' can be simply defined as a "new idea, creative thoughts, new imaginations in form of device or method".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/innovation |title= Innovation  |publisher= Merriam-Webster |website= Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate= 2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better [[problem solving | solutions]] that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing[[market (economics) | market]] needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Maranville, S.|title=Entrepreneurship in the Business Curriculum|journal=Journal of Education for Business|volume=68|pages=27–31|doi=10.1080/08832323.1992.10117582|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such innovation takes place through the provision of more-effective [[product (business)|product]]s, [[Procedure (term)|processes]], [[Service (economics)|service]]s, [[technologies]], or [[business model]]s that are made available to [[Market (economics)|market]]s, [[government]]s and [[society]]. The term "innovation" can be defined{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that "breaks into" the market or society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.hitech.2009.02.002|title=Questioning two myths in innovation literature|journal=The Journal of High Technology Management Research|volume=20|pages=40–51|year=2009|last1=Frankelius|first1=Per}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innovations tend to be produced by outsiders and [[Founder CEO|founders]] in [[startups]], rather than existing organizations. Innovation is related to, but not the same as, [[invention]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/this-is-the-difference-between-invention-and-innovation-2012-4 | title = This Is The Difference Between 'Invention' And 'Innovation' | first = Kim | last = Bhasin | date = 2012-04-02 | work = Business Insider }}&lt;/ref&gt; as innovation is more apt to involve the practical implementation of an invention (i.e. new/improved ability) to make a meaningful impact in the market or society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/09/10/whats-the-difference-between-invention-and-innovation/ | title=What's the Difference Between Invention and Innovation?|publisher=Forbes|date=2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not all innovations require an invention. Innovation often{{quantify|date=April 2018}} manifests itself via the [[engineering]] process, when the problem being solved is of a technical or scientific nature. The opposite of innovation is [[exnovation]].

Pronunciation of the word has long been argued about due to the unusual sounding of the o becoming an i. The phonetic sound would suggest a spelling of inivative if taken at the word of a true scholar. 

While a novel device is often described{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} as an innovation, in economics, [[management science]], and other fields of practice and analysis, innovation is generally considered to be the result of a process that brings together various novel ideas in such a way that they affect society. In [[industrial economics]], innovations are created and found{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} empirically from services to meet growing [[consumer]] [[demand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/general/34749412.pdf Growth in Services].

==Definition==
A 2014 survey of literature on innovation found over 40 definitions. In an industrial survey of how the [[software industry]] defined innovation, the following definition given by Crossan and Apaydin was considered to be the most complete, which  builds on the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)]] manual's definition:&lt;ref name="Henry2014"&gt;Edison, H.,  Ali, N.B., &amp; Torkar, R. (2014). [http://www.torkar.se/resources/jss-edisonNT13.pdf Towards innovation measurement in the software industry]. ''Journal of Systems and Software'' 86(5), 1390–407.&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Innovation is production or adoption, assimilation, and exploitation of a value-added novelty in economic and social spheres; renewal and enlargement of products, services, and markets; development of new methods of production; and the establishment of new management systems. It is both a process and an outcome.}}

According to Kanter innovation includes original invention and creative use and defines innovation as a generation, admission and realization of new ideas, products, services and processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Innovation in American Government: Challenges, Opportunities, and Dilemmas|last=|first=|publisher=Brookings Inst Pr|isbn=9780815703587|location=|pages=|date=1997-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two main dimensions of innovation were degree of [[novelty (patent)]] (i.e. whether an innovation is new to the firm, new to the market, new to the industry, or new to the world) and kind of innovation (i.e. whether it is processor [[product-service system]] innovation).&lt;ref name="Henry2014" /&gt; In recent organizational scholarship, researchers of workplaces have also distinguished innovation to be separate from creativity, by providing an updated definition of these two related but distinct constructs:{{quote|Workplace creativity concerns the cognitive and behavioral processes applied when attempting to generate novel ideas. Workplace innovation concerns the processes applied when attempting to implement new ideas. Specifically, innovation involves some combination of problem/opportunity identification, the introduction, adoption or modification of new ideas germane to organizational needs, the promotion of these ideas, and the practical implementation of these ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=D.

==Inter-disciplinary views==

===Business and economics===
{{main|innovation economics}}
In [[commerce|business]] and in [[economics]], innovation can become a catalyst for growth. With rapid advancements in [[transportation]] and [[communications]] over the past few decades, the old-world concepts of [[factor endowment]]s and [[comparative advantage]] which focused on an area's unique inputs are outmoded for today's [[globalization|global economy]]. Economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1883–1950), who contributed greatly to the study of [[innovation economics]], argued that industries must incessantly revolutionize the economic structure from within, that is innovate with better or more effective processes and products, as well as market distribution, such as the connection from the craft shop to factory. He famously asserted that "[[creative destruction]] is the essential fact about [[capitalism]]".&lt;ref name=capsocdem&gt;{{cite book | author = Schumpeter, J. A. | authorlink = Joseph Schumpeter | year = 1943 | title = Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy | publisher = Routledge | edition = 6 | pages = 81–84 | isbn = 978-0-415-10762-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Entrepreneur]]s continuously look for better ways to satisfy their [[consumer demand|consumer base]] with improved quality, durability, service and price which come to fruition in innovation with advanced technologies and organizational strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Heyne, P., Boettke, P. J., and Prychitko, D. L. (2010). ''The Economic Way of Thinking''. Prentice Hall, 12th ed. pp. 163, 317–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

A prime example of innovation involved the explosive boom of [[Silicon Valley]] startups out of the [[Stanford Industrial Park]]. In 1957, dissatisfied employees of [[Shockley Semiconductor]], the company of [[Nobel laureate]] and co-inventor of the [[transistor]] [[William Shockley]], left to form an independent firm, [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]. After several years, Fairchild developed into a formidable presence in the sector. Eventually, these founders left to start their own companies based on their own, unique, latest ideas, and then leading employees started their own firms. Over the next 20 years, this snowball process launched the momentous [[startup company|startup-company]] explosion of [[information technology|information-technology]] firms. Essentially, Silicon Valley began as 65 new enterprises born out of Shockley's eight former employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url= http://www.netvalley.com/svhistory.html |title= Silicon Valley History &amp; Future |website= Netvalley.com |date= |accessdate= 2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, hubs of innovation have sprung up globally with similar [[metonym]]s, including [[Silicon Alley]] encompassing [[New York City]].

Another example involves [[business incubator]]s – a phenomenon nurtured by governments around the world, close to knowledge clusters (mostly research-based) like universities or other [[Government Excellence Centre]]s – which aim primarily to channel generated knowledge to applied innovation outcomes in order to stimulate regional or national [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizations===
In the organizational context, innovation may be linked to positive changes in [[efficiency]], [[productivity]], [[Quality (business)|quality]], [[Competition (companies)|competitiveness]], and [[market share]]. However, recent research findings highlight the complementary role of organizational culture in enabling organizations to translate innovative activity into tangible performance improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2012.02529.x|title=Benefiting from Public Sector Innovation: The Moderating Role of Customer and Learning Orientation|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=72|issue=4|pages=550–559|year=2012|last1=Salge|first1=Torsten Oliver|last2=Vera|first2=Antonio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations can also improve profits and performance by providing work groups opportunities and resources to innovate, in addition to employee's core job tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1464-0597.00951|title=Sparkling Fountains or Stagnant Ponds: An Integrative Model of Creativity and Innovation Implementation in Work Groups|journal=Applied Psychology|volume=51|issue=3|pages=355–387|year=2002|last1=West|first1=Michael A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Drucker]] wrote:
{{quote|Innovation is the specific function of entrepreneurship, whether in an existing business, a public service institution, or a new venture started by a lone individual in the family kitchen. It is the means by which the entrepreneur either creates new wealth-producing resources or endows existing resources with enhanced potential for creating wealth. –Drucker&lt;ref name="Drucker"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Discipline of Innovation |work=[[Harvard Business Review]] |url= http://hbr.org/2002/08/the-discipline-of-innovation/ar/1 |date=August 2002 |access-date=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Clayton Christensen, [[disruptive innovation]] is the key to future success in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Christensen, Clayton &amp; Overdorf, Michael|year=2000|title=Meeting the Challenge of Disruptive Change|url=https://hbr.org/2000/03/meeting-the-challenge-of-disruptive-change|journal=Harvard Business Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation requires a proper structure in order to retain competitive advantage. It is necessary to create and nurture an environment of innovation. Executives and managers need to break away from traditional ways of thinking and use change to their advantage. It is a time of risk but even greater opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;''MIT Sloan Management Review'' Spring 2002. "How to identify and build New Businesses"&lt;/ref&gt; The world of work is changing with the increase in the use of technology and both companies and businesses are becoming increasingly competitive. Companies will have to downsize and re-engineer their operations to remain competitive. This will affect employment as businesses will be forced to reduce the number of people employed while accomplishing the same amount of work if not more.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, Scott D.; Johnson, Mark W.; Sinfield, Joseph V.; Altman, Elizabeth J. (2008). ''Innovator's Guide to Growth''. "Putting Disruptive Innovation to Work". Harvard Business School Press. {{ISBN|978-1-59139-846-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While disruptive innovation will typically "attack a traditional business model with a lower-cost solution and overtake incumbent firms quickly,"&lt;ref name=hbr201701/&gt; foundational innovation is slower, and typically has the potential to create new foundations for global technology systems over the longer term. Foundational innovation tends to transform business [[operating model]]s as entirely new business models [[emergence|emerge]] over many years, with gradual and steady adoption of the innovation leading to waves of [[technological change|technological]] and [[institution]]al change that gain momentum more slowly.&lt;ref name=hbr201701&gt;

All organizations can innovate, including for example hospitals, universities, and local governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19104264|year=2009|last1=Salge|first1=T. O.|title=Hospital innovativeness and organizational performance: Evidence from English public acute care|journal=Health Care Management Review|volume=34|issue=1|pages=54–67|last2=Vera|first2=A.|doi=10.1097/01.HMR.0000342978.84307.80}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, former Mayor [[Martin O’Malley]] pushed the [[City of Baltimore]] to use [[CitiStat]], a [[Performance measurement|performance-measurement]] data and management system that allows city officials to maintain statistics on several areas from crime trends to the conditions of [[pothole]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. This system aids in better evaluation of policies and procedures with accountability and efficiency in terms of time and money. In its first year, CitiStat saved the city $13.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, T. and Rushing R. (2007). [https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/general/reports/2007/04/23/2911/the-citistat-model-how-data-driven-government-can-increase-efficiency-and-effectiveness/ "The CitiStat Model: How Data-Driven Government Can Increase Efficiency and Effectiveness"]. ''Center for American Progress Report''. pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[mass transit]] systems have innovated with [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] bus fleets to [[Real-time locating system|real-time tracking]] at bus stands. In addition, the growing use of [[mobile data terminal]]s in vehicles, that serve as communication hubs between vehicles and a control center, automatically send data on location, passenger counts, engine performance, mileage and other information. This tool helps to deliver and manage transportation systems.&lt;ref&gt;Transportation Research Board (2007). "Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) Synthesis 70: Mobile Data Terminals". pp. 1–5. [http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_syn_70.pdf TCRP (PDF)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Still other innovative strategies include [[hospital]]s digitizing medical information in [[electronic medical records]]. For example, the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]]'s [[HOPE VI]] initiatives turned severely distressed [[public housing]] in urban areas into [[Urban renewal|revitalized]], mixed-income environments; the [[Harlem Children’s Zone]] used a community-based approach to educate local area children; and the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[Brownfield regulation and development|brownfield grants]] facilitates turning over [[brownfield]]s for [[environmental protection]], [[Open space reserve|green spaces]], [[Community development|community]] and [[Commerce|commercial development]].

===Sources ===
There are several sources of innovation. It can occur as a result of a focus effort by a range of different agents, by chance, or as a result of a major system failure.

According to [[Peter F. Drucker]], the general sources of innovations are different changes in industry structure, in market structure, in local and global demographics, in human perception, mood and meaning, in the amount of already available scientific knowledge, etc.&lt;ref name=Drucker/&gt;

[[File:Technological Change.jpg|thumb|Original model of three phases of the process of Technological Change]]
In the simplest [[linear model of innovation]] the traditionally recognized source is ''manufacturer innovation''. This is where an agent (person or business) innovates in order to sell the innovation. Specifically, R&amp;D measurement is the commonly used input for innovation, in particular in the business sector, named Business Expenditure on R&amp;D (BERD) that grew over the years on the expenses of the declining R&amp;D invested by the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=H. Rubin|first=Tzameret|year=2015|title=The Achilles heel of a strong private knowledge sector: evidence from Israel|url=http://nimbusvault.net/publications/koala/inimpact/papers/inkt14-011.pdf|journal=The Journal of Innovation Impact|volume=7 |issue=1|pages=80–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source of innovation, only now becoming widely recognized, is ''end-user innovation''. This is where an agent (person or company) develops an innovation for their own (personal or in-house) use because existing products do not meet their needs. [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] economist [[Eric von Hippel]] has identified end-user innovation as, by far, the most important and critical in his classic book on the subject, ''The Sources of Innovation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/books/sources/SofI.pdf |title=The Sources of Innovation |last=Von Hippel |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric von Hippel |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1988 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012160410/http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/books/sources/SofI.pdf |archivedate=12 October 2006 |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The robotics engineer [[Joseph F. Engelberger]] asserts that innovations require only three things:
# A recognized need,
# Competent people with relevant technology, and
# Financial support.&lt;ref&gt;Engelberger, J. F. (1982). "Robotics in practice: Future capabilities". ''Electronic Servicing &amp; Technology'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, innovation processes usually involve: identifying customer needs, macro and meso trends, developing competences, and finding financial support.

The Kline [[chain-linked model]] of innovation&lt;ref&gt;Kline (1985). ''Research, Invention, Innovation and Production: Models and Reality, Report INN-1'', March 1985, Mechanical Engineering Department, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; places emphasis on potential market needs as drivers of the innovation process, and describes the complex and often iterative feedback loops between marketing, design, manufacturing, and R&amp;D.

Innovation by businesses is achieved in many ways, with much attention now given to formal [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) for "breakthrough innovations". R&amp;D help spur on patents and other scientific innovations that leads to productive growth in such areas as industry, medicine, engineering, and government.&lt;ref name="MetroPolicy"&gt;Mark, M., Katz, B., Rahman, S., and Warren, D. (2008) [https://www.brookings.edu/research/metropolicy-shaping-a-new-federal-partnership-for-a-metropolitan-nation/ ''MetroPolicy: Shaping A New Federal Partnership for a Metropolitan Nation'']. Brookings Institution: Metropolitan Policy Program Report. pp. 4–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, innovations can be developed by less formal on-the-job modifications of practice, through exchange and combination of professional experience and by many other routes. Investigation of relationship between the concepts of innovation and technology transfer revealed overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286542154 |title=Perspectives on Innovation and Technology Transfer |last=Dubickis, M. |first=Gaile-Sarkane, E. |publisher=[[ScienceDirect]] |year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The more radical and revolutionary innovations tend to emerge from R&amp;D, while more incremental innovations may emerge from practice – but there are many exceptions to each of these trends.

[[Information technology]] and changing business processes and management style can produce a work climate favorable to innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forbesindia.com/article/ie/new-trends-in-innovation-management/33905/1#ixzz2iiuuDxVq |publisher=Forbes India Magazine |title= New Trends in Innovation Management |website=Forbesindia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the software tool company [[Atlassian]] conducts quarterly "ShipIt Days" in which employees may work on anything related to the company's products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.atlassian.com/company/about/shipit |title=ShipIt Days |publisher=Atlassian |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Google employees work on self-directed projects for 20% of their time (known as [[Innovation Time Off]]). Both companies cite these bottom-up processes as major sources for new products and features.

An important innovation factor includes customers buying products or using services. As a result, firms may incorporate users in [[focus group]]s (user centred approach), work closely with so called [[lead users]] (lead user approach) or users might adapt their products themselves. The lead user method focuses on idea generation based on leading users to develop breakthrough innovations. U-STIR, a project to innovate [[Europe]]’s surface [[transportation]] system, employs such workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.u-stir.eu/index.phtml?id=2537&amp;ID1=2537&amp;sprache=en |title=U-STIR |publisher=U-stir.eu |date= |accessdate=7 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918055455/http://www.u-stir.eu/index.phtml?id=2537&amp;ID1=2537&amp;sprache=en |archivedate=18 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding this [[user innovation]], a great deal of innovation is done by those actually implementing and using technologies and products as part of their normal activities. Sometimes user-innovators may become [[entrepreneur]]s, selling their product, they may choose to trade their innovation in exchange for other innovations, or they may be adopted by their suppliers. Nowadays, they may also choose to freely reveal their innovations, using methods like [[open source]]. In such networks of innovation the users or communities of users can further develop technologies and reinvent their social meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Tuomi, I. (2002). ''Networks of Innovation''.

One technique for innovating a solution to an identified problem is to actually attempt an experiment with many possible solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/the-mission/forget-about-the-10-000-hour-rule-7b7a39343523 Forget The 10,000-Hour Rule; Edison, Bezos, &amp; Zuckerberg Follow The 10,000-Experiment Rule]. Medium.com (2017-10-26). Retrieved on 2018-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was famously used by Thomas Edison's laboratory to find a version of the [[incandescent light bulb]] economically viable for home use, which involved searching through thousands of possible [[electrical filament|filament]] designs before settling on carbonized bamboo.

This technique is sometimes used in pharmaceutical [[drug discovery]]. Thousands of chemical compounds are subjected to [[high-throughput screening]] to see if they have any activity against a target molecule which has been identified as biologically significant to a disease. Promising compounds can then be studied; modified to improve efficacy, reduce side effects, and reduce cost of manufacture; and if successful turned into treatments.

The related technique of [[A/B testing]] is often used to help optimize the design of [[web site]]s and [[mobile app]]s.  This is used by major sites such as [[amazon.com]], [[Facebook]], [[Google]], and [[Netflix]].&lt;ref name="fastcompany"&gt;[https://www.fastcompany.com/3063846/why-these-tech-companies-keep-running-thousands-of-failed Why These Tech Companies Keep Running Thousands Of Failed Experiments].

===Goals and failures===
Programs of organizational innovation are typically tightly linked to organizational goals and objectives, to the [[business plan]], and to [[Market (economics)|market]] [[Competition (companies)|competitive positioning]]. One driver for innovation programs in corporations is to achieve growth objectives. As Davila et al. (2006) notes, "Companies cannot grow through cost reduction and reengineering alone... Innovation is the key element in providing aggressive top-line growth, and for increasing bottom-line results".&lt;ref name="Making Innovation Work"&gt;Davila, T., Epstein, M. J., and Shelton, R. (2006). "Making Innovation Work: How to Manage It, Measure It, and Profit from It." Upper Saddle River: Wharton School Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

One survey across a large number of manufacturing and services organizations found, ranked in decreasing order of popularity, that systematic programs of organizational innovation are most frequently driven by: improved [[quality (business)|quality]], creation of new [[Market (economics)|market]]s, extension of the [[product (business)|product]] range, reduced [[labor cost]]s, improved [[production process]]es, reduced materials, reduced [[environmental damage]], replacement of [[product (business)|product]]s/[[Service (economics)|services]], reduced [[energy]] consumption, conformance to [[regulation]]s.&lt;ref name="Making Innovation Work"/&gt;

These goals vary between improvements to products, processes and services and dispel a popular myth that innovation deals mainly with new product development. Most of the goals could apply to any organisation be it a manufacturing facility, marketing firm, hospital or local government. Whether innovation goals are successfully achieved or otherwise depends greatly on the environment prevailing in the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1287/mnsc.35.5.597|title=Innovative and Noninnovative Small Firms: Types and Characteristics|journal=Management Science|volume=35|issue=5|pages=597–606|year=1989|last1=Khan|first1=Arshad M.|last2=Manopichetwattana|first2=V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, failure can develop in programs of innovations. The causes of failure have been widely researched and can vary considerably. Some causes will be external to the organization and outside its influence of control. Others will be internal and ultimately within the control of the organization. Internal causes of failure can be divided into causes associated with the cultural infrastructure and causes associated with the innovation process itself. Common causes of failure within the innovation process in most organizations can be distilled into five types: poor goal definition, poor alignment of actions to goals, poor participation in teams, poor monitoring of results, poor communication and access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=O'Sullivan, David |year=2002|title=Framework for Managing Development in the Networked Organisations|journal=Journal of Computers in Industry|volume= 47|issue=1|pages=77–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diffusion==
[[File:InnovationLifeCycle.jpg|thumb|right]]
{{main|Diffusion of innovations}}

Diffusion of innovation research was first started in 1903 by seminal researcher [[Gabriel Tarde]], who first plotted the S-shaped [[diffusion curve]]. Tarde defined the innovation-decision process as a series of steps that includes:&lt;ref&gt;Tarde, G.  (1903). ''The laws of imitation'' (E. Clews Parsons, Trans.). New York: H. Holt &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;
# First knowledge
# Forming an attitude
# A decision to adopt or reject
# Implementation and use
# Confirmation of the decision

Once innovation occurs, innovations may be spread from the innovator to other individuals and groups. This process has been proposed that the life cycle of innovations can be described using the '[[Sigmoid function|s-curve]]' or [[Diffusion of innovations|diffusion curve]]. The s-curve maps growth of revenue or productivity against time. In the early stage of a particular innovation, growth is relatively slow as the new product establishes itself. At some point, customers begin to demand and the product growth increases more rapidly. New incremental innovations or changes to the product allow growth to continue. Towards the end of its lifecycle, growth slows and may even begin to decline. In the later stages, no amount of new investment in that product will yield a normal rate of return

The s-curve derives from an assumption that new products are likely to have "product life" – i.e., a start-up phase, a rapid increase in revenue and eventual decline. In fact, the great majority of innovations never get off the bottom of the curve, and never produce normal returns.

Innovative companies will typically be working on new innovations that will eventually replace older ones. Successive s-curves will come along to replace older ones and continue to drive growth upwards. In the figure above the first curve shows a current technology. The second shows an [[emerging technologies|emerging technology]] that currently yields lower growth but will eventually overtake current technology and lead to even greater levels of growth. The length of life will depend on many factors.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E. M. (1962). ''Diffusion of Innovation''. New York, NY: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures==
Measuring innovation is inherently difficult as it implies commensurability so that comparisons can be made in quantitative terms. Innovation, however, is by definition novelty. Comparisons are thus often meaningless across products or service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford handbook of innovation|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Fagerberg, Jan., Mowery, David C., Nelson, Richard R.|isbn=9780199264551|location=Oxford|oclc=56655392}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Edison et al.&lt;ref name="Henry2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Edison, H.,  Ali, N.B., &amp; Torkar, R.|doi=10.1016/j.jss.2013.01.013|url=http://www.torkar.se/resources/jss-edisonNT13.pdf |title=Towards innovation measurement in the software industry|journal=Journal of Systems and Software|volume=86|issue=5|pages=1390–1407|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in their review of literature on [[innovation management]] found 232 innovation metrics. They categorized these measures along five dimensions i.e. inputs to the innovation process, output from the innovation process, effect of the innovation output, measures to access the activities in an innovation process and availability of factors that facilitate such a process.&lt;ref name="Henry2013" /&gt;

There are two different types of measures for innovation: the organizational level and the political level.

===Organizational level===
The measure of innovation at the organizational level relates to individuals, team-level assessments, and private companies from the smallest to the largest company. Measure of innovation for organizations can be conducted by surveys, workshops, consultants, or internal benchmarking. There is today no established general way to measure organizational innovation. Corporate measurements are generally structured around [[balanced scorecard]]s which cover several aspects of innovation such as business measures related to finances, innovation process efficiency, employees' contribution and motivation, as well benefits for customers. Measured values will vary widely between businesses, covering for example new product revenue, spending in R&amp;D, time to market, customer and employee perception &amp; satisfaction, number of patents, additional sales resulting from past innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Davila, Tony; Marc J. Epstein and Robert Shelton (2006). ''Making Innovation Work: How to Manage It, Measure It, and Profit from It''. Upper Saddle River: Wharton School Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political level===
For the political level, measures of innovation are more focused on a country or region [[competitive advantage]] through innovation. In this context, organizational capabilities can be evaluated through various evaluation frameworks, such as those of the European Foundation for Quality Management. The [[OECD]] Oslo Manual (1995) suggests standard guidelines on measuring technological product and process innovation. Some people consider the [[Oslo Manual]] complementary to the [[Frascati Manual]] from 1963. The new Oslo manual from 2005 takes a wider perspective to innovation, and includes marketing and organizational innovation. These standards are used for example in the European [[Community Innovation Survey]]s.&lt;ref&gt;OECD The Measurement of Scientific and Technological Activities. Proposed Guidelines for Collecting and Interpreting Technological Innovation Data. Oslo Manual. 2nd edition, DSTI, OECD / European Commission Eurostat, Paris 31 December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ways of measuring innovation have traditionally been expenditure, for example, investment in R&amp;D (Research and Development) as percentage of GNP (Gross National Product). Whether this is a good measurement of innovation has been widely discussed and the Oslo Manual has incorporated some of the critique against earlier methods of measuring. The traditional methods of measuring still inform many policy decisions. The EU [[Lisbon Strategy]] has set as a goal that their average expenditure on R&amp;D should be 3% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/ |title=Industrial innovation – Enterprise and Industry |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=7 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827125633/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/ |archivedate=27 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Level Down of Innovation in Silicon Valley ===
Innovation is starting to decline due to the newly introduced immigration policies. The new immigration policies have effects on the economy because 25% of the companies were created by foreign entrepreneurs. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/08/30/why-startups-are-leaving-silicon-valley|title=Why startups are leaving Silicon Valley|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indicators===
Many scholars claim that there is a great bias towards the "science and technology mode" (S&amp;T-mode or STI-mode), while the "learning by doing, using and interacting mode" (DUI-mode) is ignored and measurements and research about it rarely done. For example, an institution may be high tech with the latest equipment, but lacks crucial doing, using and interacting tasks important for innovation.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

A common industry view (unsupported by empirical evidence) is that comparative [[cost-effectiveness]] research is a form of [[price controls|price control]] which reduces returns to industry, and thus limits R&amp;D expenditure, stifles future innovation and compromises new products access to markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19523121|pmc=2881450|year=2009|last1=Chalkidou|first1=K.|title=Comparative effectiveness research and evidence-based health policy: Experience from four countries|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume=87|issue=2|pages=339–67|last2=Tunis|first2=S.|last3=Lopert|first3=R.|last4=Rochaix|first4=L.|last5=Sawicki|first5=P. T.|last6=Nasser|first6=M.|last7=Xerri|first7=B.|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2009.00560.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some academics claim cost-effectiveness research is a valuable value-based measure of innovation which accords "truly significant" therapeutic advances (i.e. providing "health gain") higher prices than free market mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roughead |first=E. |last2=Lopert |first2=R. |last3=Sansom |first3=L. |title=Prices for innovative pharmaceutical products that provide health gain: a comparison between Australia and the United States Value |journal=[[Health (journal)|Health]] |year=2007 |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=514–20 |doi=10.1111/j.1524-4733.2007.00206.x |pmid=17970935 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[value-based pricing]] has been viewed as a means of indicating to industry the type of innovation that should be rewarded from the public purse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hughes |first=B. |title=Payers Growing Influence on R&amp;D Decision Making |journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery |year=2008 |volume=7 |issue= 11|pages=876–78 |doi=10.1038/nrd2749 |pmid=18974741 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Australian]] academic developed the case that national comparative [[cost-effectiveness analysis]] systems should be viewed as measuring "health innovation" as an [[evidence-based policy]] concept for valuing innovation distinct from valuing through competitive markets, a method which requires strong [[anti-trust]] laws to be effective, on the basis that both methods of assessing [[pharmaceutical innovations]] are mentioned in annex 2C.1 of the [[AUSFTA|Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Faunce |first=T. |last2=Bai |first2=J. |last3=Nguyen |first3=D. |title=Impact of the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement on Australian medicines regulation and prices |journal=[[Journal of Generic Medicines]] |year=2010 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=18–29 |doi=10.1057/jgm.2009.40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Faunce TA|title=Global intellectual property protection of 'innovative' pharmaceuticals: Challenges for bioethics and health law in B Bennett and G Tomossy|publisher=Globalization and Health Springer|date=2006|url=http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-Ch%20Globalisation%20and%20Health%20Fau.pdf|format=PDF|website=Law.anu.edu.au|accessdate=18 June 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414040804/http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-Ch%20Globalisation%20and%20Health%20Fau.pdf|archivedate=14 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Faunce |first=T.

===Rankings===
Many research studies try to rank countries based on measures of innovation. Common areas of focus include: [[high-tech]] companies, [[manufacturing]], [[patent]]s, [[post secondary education]], [[research and development]],  and research personnel. The left ranking of the top 10 countries below is based on the 2016 [[Bloomberg Innovation Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-19/these-are-the-world-s-most-innovative-economies|title=These Are the World's Most Innovative Economies|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies may vary widely; for example the [[Global Innovation Index]] 2016 ranks [[Switzerland]] as number one wherein countries like [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]] do not even make the top ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://de.statista.com/infografik/5509/die-10-innovativsten-laender-weltweit-nach-dem-global-innovation-index/|title=Infografik: Schweiz bleibt globaler Innovationsführer|last=|first=|date=|website=Statista Infografiken|publisher=Statista (In German)|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future ===
In 2005 [[Jonathan Huebner]], a [[physicist]] working at the [[Pentagon Building|Pentagon]]'s [[Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake|Naval Air Warfare Center]], argued on the basis of both U.S. [[patent]]s and world technological breakthroughs, per capita, that the rate of human technological innovation peaked in 1873 and has been slowing ever since.&lt;ref name=Huebner&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Huebner | first1 = J. | title = A possible declining trend for worldwide innovation | doi = 10.1016/j.techfore.2005.01.003 | journal = [[Technological Forecasting and Social Change]] | volume = 72 | issue = 8 | pages = 980–986 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/050707/7inventor.htm|title=Science: Wanna be an inventor? Don't bother| last=Hayden|first=Thomas|date=7 July 2005|work=U.S. News &amp; World Report|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his article, he asked "Will the level of technology reach a maximum and then decline as in the Dark Ages?"&lt;ref name=Huebner/&gt; In later comments to ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine, Huebner clarified that while he believed that we will reach a rate of innovation in 2024 equivalent to that of the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], he was not predicting the reoccurrence of the Dark Ages themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adler|first=Robert|title=Entering a dark age of innovation|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7616-entering-a-dark-age-of-innovation.html|accessdate=30 May 2013|newspaper=New Scientist|date=2 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Smart]] criticized the claim and asserted that [[technological singularity]] researcher [[Ray Kurzweil]] and others showed a "clear trend of acceleration, not deceleration" when it came to innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smart | first1 = J. | title = Discussion of Huebner article | doi = 10.1016/j.techfore.2005.07.001 | journal = [[Technological Forecasting and Social Change]] | volume = 72 | issue = 8 | pages = 988–995 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation replied to Huebner the journal his article was published in, citing [[Second Life]] and [[eHarmony]] as proof of accelerating innovation; to which Huebner replied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huebner|first1=Jonathan|title=Response by the Authors|journal=[[Technological Forecasting and Social Change]]|volume=72|issue=8|pages=995–1000|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2005.05.008|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovation and Development===
The theme of innovation as a tool to disrupting patterns of poverty has gained momentum since the mid-2000s among major [[international development]] actors such as [[DFID]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dfid.blog.gov.uk/author/jonathan-wong-head-of-dfids-innovation-hub/ |title=Jonathan Wong, Head of DFID's Innovation Hub &amp;#124; DFID bloggers |website=Dfid.blog.gov.uk |date=2014-09-24 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gates Foundation]]'s use of the [[Grand Challenge]] funding model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2014/10/Gates-Foundation-Grand-Challenges-Breakthrough-Science |title=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and Grand Challenge Partners Commit to Innovation with New Investments in Breakthrough Science – Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation |website=Gatesfoundation.org |date=2014-10-07 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[USAID]]'s Global Development Lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/GlobalDevLab |title=Global Development Lab &amp;#124; U.S. Agency for International Development |website=Usaid.gov |date=2015-08-05 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Networks have been established to support innovation in development, such as D-Lab at [[MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d-lab.mit.edu/idin |title=International Development Innovation Network (IDIN) &amp;#124; D-Lab |website=D-lab.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investment funds have been established to identify and catalyze innovations in [[developing countries]], such as DFID's Global Innovation Fund,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/international-development-funding/global-innovation-fund |title=Global Innovation Fund International development funding |website=GOV.UK |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Development Innovation Fund]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hdif-tz.org |title=Human Development Innovation Fund (HDIF) |website=Hdif-tz.org |date=2015-08-14 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (in partnership with USAID) the Global Development Innovation Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/usaid-and-dfid-announce-global-development-innovation-ventures |title=USAID and DFID Announce Global Development Innovation Ventures to Invest in Breakthrough Solutions to World Poverty &amp;#124; U.S. Agency for International Development |website=Usaid.gov |date=2013-06-06 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government policies==
Given the noticeable effects on [[efficiency]], [[quality of life]], and [[productivity|productive growth]], innovation is a key factor in society and economy. Consequently, policymakers have long worked to develop environments that will foster innovation and its resulting positive benefits, from funding [[Research and Development]] to supporting regulatory change, funding the development of innovation clusters, and using public purchasing and standardisation to 'pull' innovation through.

For instance, experts are advocating that the U.S. federal government launch a National Infrastructure Foundation, a nimble, collaborative strategic intervention organization that will house innovations programs from fragmented silos under one entity, inform federal officials on innovation [[performance measurement|performance metrics]], strengthen industry-university partnerships, and support innovation [[economic development]] initiatives, especially to strengthen [[business cluster|regional clusters]]. Because clusters are the geographic incubators of innovative products and processes, a cluster development grant program would also be targeted for implementation. By focusing on innovating in such areas as precision [[manufacturing]], [[information technology]], and [[clean energy]], other areas of national concern would be tackled including [[government debt]], [[carbon footprint]], and [[oil dependence]].&lt;ref name="MetroPolicy"/&gt; The U.S. [[Economic Development Administration]] understand this reality in their continued Regional Innovation Clusters initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eda.gov/PDF/EDA_FY_2010_Annual_Report.pdf |format=PDF |title=U.S. Economic Development Administration : Fiscal Year 2010 Annual Report |website=Eda.gov |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, federal grants in R&amp;D, a crucial driver of innovation and productive growth, should be expanded to levels similar to [[Japan]], [[Finland]], [[South Korea]], and [[Switzerland]] in order to stay globally competitive. Also, such grants should be better procured to [[metropolitan economy|metropolitan areas]], the essential engines of the American economy.&lt;ref name="MetroPolicy"/&gt;

Many countries recognize the importance of research and development as well as innovation including Japan's [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mext.go.jp/english/a06.htm |title=Science and Technology |publisher=MEXT |date= |accessdate=7 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905171421/http://www.mext.go.jp/english/a06.htm |archivedate=5 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmbf.de/en/Ministry.php |title=BMBF " Ministry |publisher=Bmbf.de |date= |accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Science and Technology]] in the People's Republic of China. Furthermore, Russia's innovation programme is the [[Medvedev modernisation programme]] which aims at creating a diversified economy based on high technology and innovation. Also, the [[Government of Western Australia]] has established a number of innovation incentives for government departments. [[Landgate]] was the first Western Australian government agency to establish its Innovation Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landgate.wa.gov.au/innovation |title=Home  |publisher=Landgate Innovation Program |website=Landgate.wa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Regions]] have taken a more proactive role in supporting innovation. Many regional governments are setting up [[regional innovation agency]] to strengthen regional innovation capabilities. In [[Medellin]], [[Colombia]], the municipality of Medellin created in 2009 [[Ruta N]] to transform the city into a knowledge city.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23792949.2018.1538702?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Jesus: The Evidence''''' is a three-part television [[miniseries]] made by [[London Weekend Television]] (LWT) for [[Channel 4]], and transmitted in the UK in 1984 over the Easter period (Ep.1 - 8 April 1984; Ep.2 -15 April 1984; and Ep.3 - 22 April 1984). The series was one of the first television attempts to ‘demythologize’ the [[Gospel]] narratives.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}   The series suggests that the [[Jesus]] of the Bible was a [[myth]] created by the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]], and [[First Council of Nicaea|developed by the established Church]] in the fourth century.

== Production ==

The series was the first major religious commission by the UK’s newly established fourth channel, and signaled a major departure from the largely non-critical approach to religious subject-matter that had been established from the earliest days of the [[BBC]].  In setting itself up to be deliberately provocative, questioning and speculative, the series sparked a furore, and marked a significant moment in the deterioration in the relationship between the Christian churches, and the UK's broadcasting institutions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallis|first=Richard|date=2016-01-27|title=Channel 4 and the declining influence of organized religion on UK television. The case of Jesus: The Evidence|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01439685.2015.1132821|journal=Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television|language=en|volume=36|issue=4|pages=668–688|doi=10.1080/01439685.2015.1132821|issn=0143-9685}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The series's content referenced a range of popularized treatments of the search for the ‘real’ Jesus, including Hugh Schonfield’s ''[[The Passover Plot]]'', and Morton Smith’s ''[[Jesus the Magician]]''.

 The idea for the series was sparked by an article about ''The Gnostic Gospels'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/6346170|title=The gnostic Gospels|last=1943-|first=Pagels, Elaine H.,|date=1980, ©1979|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|isbn=0297777092|location=London|oclc=6346170}}&lt;/ref&gt; an award-winning book by the American scholar [[Elaine Pagels]], which was previewed in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in December 1979&lt;ref&gt;Whale, John ‘The Gospel of the Losers’, The Sunday Times, December 2, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; tweaking the interest of [[John Birt, Baron Birt|John Birt]] who at that time was Director of Programmes at LWT.  An accompanying book of the same name was produced with the series by author [[Ian Wilson (author)|Ian Wilson]] who also appeared as an interviewee.

The series featured a number of notable scholars, including [[Helmut Koester]], [[Werner Kümmel]], [[Dennis Nineham]], [[Morton Smith]], [[I. Howard Marshall|I Howard Marshall]], [[George Albert Wells|George A Wells]], and [[Géza Vermes|Geza Vermes]].

The show was narrated by actor, [[Jeremy Kemp]]; researched by [[imdbname:0103873|Jean-Claude Bragard]]; produced and directed by David W. Rolfe; Executive Produced by Jane Hewland; and Series Produced by Julian Norridge.

== Controversy ==

The series became the focus of a campaign of protest led by the Evangelical youth magazine, ''Buzz'', which drew wide support from across many sections of the churches (particularly the Evangelical and Catholic wings).  One leading commentator noted that what the series demonstrated was the way in which Channel 4 was ‘not so much the last of the main public service channels to arrive, as the first swallow heralding the broadcasting pluralism of cable and satellite’&lt;ref&gt;Longley, Clifford, 'Sceptics discount vital evidence' ''The Times'', 9 April 1984; p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; .  According to Bonner and Aston (2003):&lt;blockquote&gt;The producers did not help themselves either by including a statue of Christ that symbolically exploded in slow-motion.  Originally intended to illustrate a point made by Albert Schweitzer, it became a sort of visual punctuation mark used several times in the first and second programmes, causing genuine offence to some.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bonner|first=Paul|title=Cable and Satellite|date=2003|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/9780230287136_11|work=Independent Television in Britain|volume=|pages=169|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=9781349396207|access-date=2018-08-21|last2=Aston|first2=Lesley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]] then Regius Professor of Divinity at [[University of Cambridge]], commented that the programmes ‘juxtaposed perfectly sensible scholarly opinions with opinions so outré and hard to defend on rational grounds that disservice was done to the sensible people by the company they were portrayed as keeping’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Choruses are eligible to win any number of times but must sit out for two years after they win. The only non-U.S. choruses to win this championship were The Dukes Of Harmony (1977 &amp; 1980) and the Toronto Northern Lights (2013), both from Canada.  The Dallas-based Vocal Majority has won this competition a record 13 times.

[[File:Correggio_MadonnaSzentFerenccel.jpg|thumb|''Madonna and Child with St Francis'']]
'''''Madonna and Child with St Francis''''' or '''''Madonna of St Francis''''' is a 1514-1515 painting by [[Correggio]], now held in the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]] in [[Dresden]], Germany. It shows [[Francis of Assisi]], with the stigmata, prostrating himself before an enthroned Madonna and Child - the work's theme is the intercession of the Madonna, which was promoted by the [[Franciscans]] after the definition of the dogma of the [[Immaculate Conception]] in 1473. Francis is supported by [[Anthony of Padua]], whilst on the right are [[Catherine of Alexandria]] and [[John the Baptist]] and on the base of the Madonna's throne is a small [[grisaille]] image of [[Moses]] with the tablets of the law. Catherine's wheel bears the painter's signature "Antonivs de Alegri F.[ecit]".

==History==
The contract for the work (Correggio's first major commission) was signed by the artist on 30 August 1514, with the consent of his still-unmarried father, and of brother Girolamo Cattania, the guardian of the Franciscan convent in the town of [[Correggio, Emilia-Romagna]], whose church was dedicated to St Francis. The work was probably meant as the high altarpiece for the convent church - that altar was site of the Da Correggio family vault. He was paid for it on 4 April 1515, showing how fast he produced it - these two records provide the first documentary evidence of his career. 

Just before 1638 the painting was confiscated by [[Francesco I d'Este]] and taken to the [[Ducal Palace of Modena|Palazzo Ducale]] in [[Modena]], where it hung alongside five other Correggios seized from the duchy's territory. In 1746 the impoverished [[Francesco III d'Este]] tried to raise some money by selling the hundred most famous works in the [[Galleria Estense]], including the six Correggios, to [[Augustus III of Saxony]].

'''Melissa Sue Anderson''' (born September 26, 1962) is an American-Canadian actress. She began her career as a [[child actor|child actress]] after appearing in several commercials in [[Los Angeles]]. Anderson is known for her role as [[Mary Ingalls]] on the [[NBC]] drama series ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', on which she starred from 1974 until 1981. She is also known for her film roles, including Vivian in ''Midnight Offerings'' (1981), Ginny in the [[slasher film]] ''[[Happy Birthday to Me (film)|Happy Birthday to Me]]'' (1981), and Alex in the ''[[ABC Afterschool Special]]'', ''[[ABC Afterschool Special#Season Eight (1979-80)|Which Mother Is Mine?]]'' (1979).

Anderson became a naturalized citizen of Canada in 2007. In 2010, she published ''The Way I See It: A Look Back at My Life on Little House'', an autobiographical account of her years acting on ''Little House on the Prairie''.

==Early life==
Anderson was born September 26, 1962, in [[Berkeley, California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|p=321 |title=Screen World 2002|author=Lynch, Tom|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=2002 |isbn=978-1-557-83598-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second of two daughters, to James and Marion Anderson.&lt;ref name=gritten/&gt; Her sister, Maureen, is twelve years her senior.&lt;ref name=gritten&gt;{{cite web|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|url=http://people.com/archive/with-dates-like-sinatra-junior-melissa-sue-anderson-is-outgrowing-her-little-house-vol-15-no-21/|title=With Dates Like Sinatra Junior Melissa Sue Anderson Is Outgrowing Her 'little House'|author=Gritten, David|date=June 1, 1981|accessdate=February 11, 2018|volume=15|number=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she was seven years old, Anderson's family relocated from the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] to [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=gritten/&gt; Her parents divorced when she was thirteen years old, and she was raised [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] by her mother.&lt;ref name=gritten/&gt; As a young child, Anderson appeared in commercials for [[Mattel]] and [[Sears]].&lt;ref name=gritten/&gt;

==Career==
Anderson's show business career began when a dance teacher urged her parents to find an agent for her. After appearing in commercials, she was soon in demand for television roles. Her first came in a 1972 episode of ''[[Bewitched]]'' titled "Tabitha's First Day of School". Another memorable early role was as Millicent, a girl who kissed Bobby on ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''. She also appeared in an episode of ''[[Shaft (TV series)|Shaft]]'' the same year.&lt;ref name=gritten/&gt;

At the age of eleven, Anderson landed the role of Mary Ingalls on ''Little House on the Prairie''. She would go on to star on the series for eight seasons beginning in 1974, and leaving after season seven; later appearing in two episodes of season eight in late 1981.  The wig she wore in later episodes was made from Yak hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.instyle.co.uk/beauty/news/yak-hair-extensions|title=Yak Hair, Would You Dare? The Hair Extension That Is Taking Over The Internet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James at 15 Lance Kerwin Melissa Sue Anderson 1977.jpg|thumb|left|Anderson with Lance Kerwin in the television film, ''James at 15'' (1977)]]
In 1976, [[Michael Landon]] asked Anderson if she would appear in his autobiographical film ''[[The Loneliest Runner]]''. Anderson agreed to play Nancy Rizzi, the first girlfriend of John Curtis (based on Landon and played by [[Lance Kerwin]]), saying she was very thrilled to have been asked. In 1977, she once again co-starred as the love interest opposite Lance Kerwin in the television film ''[[James at 15]]''.

She was nominated for a 1978 Primetime [[Emmy Award]] for Best Leading Actress in a Drama Series for her work on ''Little House on the Prairie'' and won the Emmy Award for her performance in ''[[ABC Afterschool Special#Season Eight (1979-80)|Which Mother Is Mine?]]'', which aired as an ''[[ABC Afterschool Special]]'' in 1979. Also in 1979, she played the title role of Dana Lee Gilbert, a [[North Dakota]] [[Transfer credit|transfer student]] to [[Los Angeles]]' [[San Fernando Valley]] in [[CBS]]'s [[television film]] ''[[Survival of Dana]]''.

The '''''Mond Crucifixion''''' (or '''''Crocifissione Gavari'''''; both names are after former owners) is a [[painting]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]].

An early work influenced by [[Perugino]], it was originally an [[altarpiece]] in the church of [[San Domenico, Città di Castello]], near Raphael's hometown of [[Urbino]]. The painting shows [[Jesus]] on the cross, who is looking peaceful even though he is dying. There are two angels catching his blood in chalices. On Jesus' left kneels [[Mary Magdalene]], with [[John the Evangelist]] standing behind her. On his right [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] stands, and [[Jerome|St. Jerome]], to whom the altar was dedicated, is kneeling. At the foot of the cross is the inscription &lt;small&gt;RAPHAEL/ VRBIN / AS /.P.[INXIT]&lt;/small&gt; ("Raphael of Urbino painted this") in silver letters.

The painting was bequeathed to the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] by [[Ludwig Mond]].

The sun and moon at the top are present despite the [[First Council of Constantinople|Council of Constantinople]] prohibition of such symbology for its reference to other religions.{{dubious|date=July 2017}}

==Painting materials==
The painting was analyzed in the National Gallery London&lt;ref&gt;Roy, A., Spring, M., Plazzotta, C. ‘Raphael’s Early Work in the National Gallery: Paintings before Rome‘. National Gallery Technical Bulletin Vol 25, pp 4–35.&lt;/ref&gt; and the typical [[pigments]] of the [[Renaissance]] period were identified. He painted the Crucifixion among other pigments with natural [[ultramarine]], [[lead-tin-yellow]], [[verdigris]], [[vermilion]] and [[ochres]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/raphael-moon-crucifixion/ Raphael, The Mond Crucifixion], ColourLex&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Morticia Addams''' is a [[fictional character]] from ''[[The Addams Family]]'' television and film series. Created by [[cartoonist]] [[Charles Addams]], she was based on his first wife Barbara.

==Cartoons==

Morticia first appeared in Charles Addams' newspaper cartoons&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/a/addams_charles.htm|title=Charles Addams|website=lambiek.net|language=en|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the stern, aloof matriarch of the Family. She often appeared with the rest of the family, and was, along with Gomez and Grandmama, one of the few members to actually speak in the cartoons.

== Background ==

Morticia is the wife of [[Gomez Addams]] and mother of [[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]], [[Pugsley Addams|Pugsley]] and Pubert Addams. The character originated in the Charles Addams cartoons for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine in the 1930s. In the cartoons, none of the family members had names. When the characters were adapted to the 1964 [[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|television series]], Charles Addams' selection of her name was inspired by "[[mortician]]". Morticia's maiden name is "Frump" and she has an older sister named Ophelia (also played by [[Carolyn Jones]]). In the television series, her mother (Uncle Fester's sister) was named Hester Frump (played by [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]]). Her mother-in-law is [[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama Addams]]. In the 1990s Addams Family films, Grandmama is actually Morticia's mother, not Gomez's.

{{quote | The real head of the family&amp;nbsp;... low-voiced, incisive and subtle, smiles are rare...ruined beauty&amp;nbsp;... contemptuous and original and with fierce family loyalty&amp;nbsp;... even in disposition, muted, witty, sometimes deadly&amp;nbsp;... given to low-keyed rhapsodies about her garden of [[Atropa belladonna|deadly nightshade]], [[Hyoscyamus niger|henbane]] and [[Eleocharis acicularis|dwarf’s hair]]&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlesaddams.com/ Charles Addams official website]&lt;/ref&gt; | [[Charles Addams]] }}

Morticia is described as a witch; she is slim, with extremely pale skin and long flowing straight black hair. In one episode she is seen wearing a black pointed hat. She commonly wears black hobble dresses to match her hair, tightly form fitting, with a [[hobble skirt|hobble dress]], with fringe of octopus-like cloth "tentacles" at the lower hem. According to Wednesday, Morticia applies [[baking powder]] to her face instead of actual makeup. In each episode, she easily allures her husband Gomez by speaking [[French language|French]] (or any other foreign language for that matter). Morticia is musically inclined, and is often seen freely strumming a Japanese [[shamisen]]. She frequently enjoys cutting the buds off of roses, which she discards (keeping only the stems), likes cutting out paper dolls with three heads and making sweaters with three arms, collecting the mail from the hand-in-the-box [[Thing (The Addams Family)|Thing]], and cooking unusual concoctions for her husband, including eye of newt. Her personal pet is Cleopatra, a fictitious breed of [[carnivorous plant]] called an African Strangler, and to which she feeds hamburgers.

Morticia's family tree can be traced back to Salem, Massachusetts, and witchcraft is also implied at times in the television series.&lt;ref&gt;Season 1: Episode 5, "The Addams Family Tree"&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Morticia likes to "smoke," an activity that does not involve cigarettes or cigars (like her husband frequently enjoys), but smoke instead emanates from below her.&lt;ref&gt;Season 1: Episode 9, "The New Neighbors meet the Addams"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, she was included in [[Yahoo!]]'s Top 10 TV Moms from Six Decades of Television for the time period 1964–1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adair|first=Aly|title=Top 10 Favorite TV Moms|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/top-10-favorite-tv-moms-2778263.html?cat=25|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=June 17, 2012|date=February 27, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021092742/http://voices.yahoo.com/top-10-favorite-tv-moms-2778263.html?cat=25|archivedate=October 21, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AOL]] named her one of the 100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Potts|first=Kim|title=100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2011/03/02/100-most-memorable-female-tv-characters/|work=AOL TV|accessdate=July 16, 2012|date=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Morticia film.JPG|thumb|[[Anjelica Huston]] as Morticia in the 1991 film ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'']]
Morticia was portrayed by [[Carolyn Jones]] in the television series of the 1960s and by [[Anjelica Huston]] in ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'' ([[1991 in film|1991]]) and its sequel ''[[Addams Family Values]]'' ([[1993 in film|1993]]). Huston's portrayal of Morticia was always illuminated by a ghostly glow around the eyes, which became most noticeable when she was standing or lying in dim light.  [[Daryl Hannah]] played Morticia in the 1998 film ''[[Addams Family Reunion]]''. Canadian actress [[Ellie Harvie]] played Morticia in the revival series, ''[[The New Addams Family]]''. In the first animated series made in 1973, Morticia was voiced by [[Janet Waldo]]. Jones also voiced this character in an episode of ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' that featured the family. In the 1992 animated series, she was voiced by [[Nancy Linari]]. In the 2010 Broadway musical, Morticia was portrayed by [[Bebe Neuwirth]]. [[Brooke Shields]] replaced her in the role of Morticia on June 28, 2011.

Morticia was also one of the inspirations for the Walt Disney character [[Magica De Spell]], first designed and drawn by [[Carl Barks]].&lt;ref&gt;https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2013/08/27/creating-new-ducktales-art-with-mondo/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natasha Fatale]], a villain from the [[Rocky and Bullwinkle]] cartoons, was also based on Morticia's design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/interviews/anderson/home.asp|title=Alex Anderson interview|date=26 October 2010|work=Hogan's Alley |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026035438/http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/interviews/anderson/home.asp|archivedate=26 October 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Music Law''' refers to legal aspects of the music industry, and certain legal aspects in other sectors of the entertainment industry. The music industry includes [[record label]]s, music publishers, merchandisers, the live events sector and of course performers and artists.

The terms "music law" and "entertainment law", along with "business affairs", are used by the music and entertainment industry and should not be thought of as academic definitions. Indeed, music law covers a range of traditional legal subjects including [[intellectual property]] law ([[copyright]] law, [[trademark]]s, image publicity rights, design rights), [[competition law]], [[bankruptcy law]], [[contract law]], [[defamation]] and, for the live events industry, [[immigration law]], [[health and safety law]], and licensing.

==Definitions==
*A "compilation" refers to work formed from already existing materials in a way that forms its own original work, including collective works.
*"Copies" are physical objects that hold, fix, or embody a work such as a music tape, film, CD, statue, play, or printed sheet music.
*"Sound recordings" can refer to any audio recording including the sound accompanying motion pictures.
*"Copyright owner" is the entity that legally owns rights to a work.&lt;ref name="copyright.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/|title=Copyright Law of the United States - U.S. Copyright Office|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Performance" The copyright holder has the exclusive right to perform the work in public, or to license others to perform it. The right applies to “literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works.".&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 106(4)&lt;/ref&gt; Playing a CD in public, or showing a film in public is "performing" the work.

==Copyright==

{{main| copyright}}

==Publishing==

Publishing is the primary source of income for musicians writing their own music.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Money collected from the 'publishing' rights is ultimately destined for songwriters - the composers of works, whether or not they are the recording artist or performer. Often, [[songwriter]]s will work for a musical ensemble to help them with musical aspects of the composition, but here again, the writer of the song is the owner of it and will own the copyrights in the song and thus will be entitled to the publishing revenues.  Copyrights in compositions are not the same as [[sound recording]]s.  A recording artist can record a song and sell it to another band or company. As a result, that particular company will own the recording, but not the song. The original writer will always maintain the copyright for that particular song. The publishing money is connected to the copyright, so the owner will be the only one making money off of the song itself. All successful songwriters will join a collection society (such as ASCAP and BMI in the USA, SOCAN in Canada, JASRAC in Japan, GEMA in Germany and PRS for Music in the UK, etc.) and many will enter into agreements with music publishing companies who will exploit their works on the songwriters behalf for a share of ownership, although many of these deals involve the transfer (assignment) of copyright from the songwriter to the music publisher.

Both the recorded music sector and music publishing sector have their foundations in [[intellectual property]] law and all of the major recording labels and major music publishers and many independent record labels and publishers have dedicated "business and legal affairs" departments with in-house lawyers whose role is not only to secure intellectual property rights from recording artists, performers and songwriters but also to exploit those rights and protect those rights on a global basis. There are a number of specialist independent law firms around the world who advise on music and entertainment law whose clients include recording artists, performers, producers, songwriters, labels, music publishers, stage and set designers, choreographers, graphic artists, games designers, merchandisers, broadcasters, artist managers, distributors, collection societies and the live events sector (which further includes festivals, venues, promoters, booking agents and production service providers such as lighting and staging companies).

==Performance Licensing==
{{main|Music licensing}}

==Business==

The US Government views artists that give concerts and sell merchandise as a business. Bands that tour internationally will also face a plethora of legislation around the world including health and safety laws, immigration laws and tax legislation. Also, many relationships are governed by often complex contractual agreements.

In the US it is important for musicians to get legal business licenses. These can be obtained at a city hall or local government center. The business license will require the tracking of sales, wages, and gigs. A tax ID is also necessary for all businesses. Musicians that fail to comply with the tax ID process and do not report their profits and losses to the government can face serious consequences with the IRS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7463">A '''new media artist''' may use the following media to create works of art: the [[Internet]], [[computer hardware]], computer software-servers, [[Router (computing)|routers]], personal computers, [[database]] applications, [[Script (recorded media)|scripts]] and [[computer files]].  These artists use the aforementioned technologies in conjunction with video and computer games, surveillance cameras, wireless phones, hand-held computers, Apache Web server, Hypertext Markup Language and [[Global Positioning System]] devices (GPS).&lt;ref name=Tribe2007p7&gt;Tribe p.7&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Dada]] and [[Pop art]] movements greatly influence new media artists and provide a foundation from which to borrow and reinvent conceptual and aesthetic ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Tribe p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and influences==

[[Pop art]] and [[Dada]] influence the conceptual and aesthetic roots of New Media art. (Tribe2007 p.&amp;nbsp;7) The  [[photomontage]] and [[readymade]] occur multiple times throughout  various New Media  works.  

In the genres of corporate parody and [[hacktivism]], influences from  Pop artists play a highly influential role for New Media artists. [[Claes Oldenburg]] designed in a collaborative effort the [[Second American Revolution]] monument for Yale's school of architecture in the 1960s. A caterpillar tractor of painted steel, aluminum, and fiberglass tip which subverts the warlike reference by casting a large tube of lipstick in place of a missile, in protest of the [[Vietnam war]].&lt;ref&gt;Stockstad2005, p. 1104&lt;/ref&gt; both humor and critical approach were used to drive home a definitive anti-war statement and sentiment.  

New Media artists approach differs in that the audience must interact and come to find their own conclusion. The message is straightforward but arriving there requires thought and investigation into the deeper message.  An example of this is seen in CarnivorePE, a parody of [[FBI]] surveillance activity.  CarnivorePE was designed by the Radical Software Group, founded by [[Alexander R. Galloway]] in 2000 with a team of artists.   What comes into question is whether the use of  technologically sophisticated devices  on everyday citizens is reasonable, and what is the rationale behind the practice.   CarnivorePE  was in response to a digital wiretapping  software called [[Carnivore (software)|Carnivore]] which the [[FBI]] used to surveil internet traffic in the 1990s. Agents could listen into chat room conversations and emails.  The software uses an open source tool called a [[packet sniffer]] to listen in on the network on which it was installed. This detects the packets of data that make up emails sent and received, text and images posted online and websites browsed by individuals on the network.  The data harvested is then used to develop clients: which is raw material for artistic interfaces. These clients are produced by New Media artists who then used an animated [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] interface to create brightly hued translucent circles to represent each active user.  Each is represented with a different color; deep green, for example, represents someone using [[AOL]].&lt;ref&gt;Tribe2007,p.78&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of these artists is to observe the utilitarian definition of surveillance, examine the use of it, and then to construct an artistic spectacle which demonstrates perhaps that wiretapping on ordinary citizens can be a spectacle in of itself. Software is then transformed into a colorful work of art with moving images and a powerful message.

Pop artists' main goal was to expose the power of commercial culture, while both embracing and parodying popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Stockstad2005, p1104&lt;/ref&gt;   In contrast to Pop art,  New Media artists can employ a level of absurdity or purposeless.&lt;ref name=Tribe2007p38&gt;Tribe 2007, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; The debate is open between artists using technologies for producing amazing effects and those who consider that new media are new means to convey meaning and a form of social engagement. This is clearly expressed in certain form of hacking or what the artist and theorist [[Maurice Benayoun]] calls ''Critical Fusion'',&lt;ref&gt;Benayoun-Dump2011, p315&lt;/ref&gt; a critical approach of the "fusion of fiction and reality", built to unveil social and political issues at stake in the physical world. ''Critical Fusion'' is, according to Maurice Benayoun, a branch of ''Open Media Art''.&lt;ref&gt;Benayoun2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vuk Ćosić]], a Slovanian artist trained in archaeology, is among one of the pioneering New Media artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ljudmila.org/~vuk/ascii/film/ ASCII History of Moving Images], 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  He also coined the term ''net art''.&lt;ref name=Tribe2007p38/&gt;  For his piece, he uses ASCII characters to construct images. It is not a new practice for artists prior to the 90s to construct images using this method, and these images can be made manually or by using software that converts images into ASCII characters. Cosic then incorporates the use of films and television programs to convert these images into animation with a [[retro-futurism|retro-futuristic]] aesthetic.&lt;ref name=Tribe2007p38/&gt;

==History==

[[Vera Molnar]] a pioneer in computer art used geometric and mathematical abstraction to aid her artistic expression. In 1968 she began working with a computer to create images with the aid of a computer and terminals like a plotter and a cathode-ray tube screen.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Early works of computer art include ''(Des)orders'' (1969). 

[[Manfred Mohr]] influenced by German philosopher [[Max Bense]] and French composer [[Pierre Barbaud]], created [[hypercube]]s founded on a [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]], algorithmic aesthetic. In 1969 he  used a computer to superimpose multiple rules and found that this was the only way possible to superimpose multiple rules without losing track of the general concept. This strategy made the information become deeply buried and a certain participation is demanded from the viewer. Each work is based in a subset of a defined structure, ranging from cubes to 6-dimensional hypercubes.&lt;ref&gt;(Popper2007, p.68)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Music education|settings}}
An '''orchestra''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔːr|k|ɪ|s|t|r|ə}}; {{IPA-it|orˈkɛstra|lang}}) is a large [[Musical ensemble|instrumental ensemble]] typical of [[classical music]], which mixes instruments from different families, including bowed [[string instrument]]s such as [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], and [[double bass]], as well as [[Brass instrument|brass]], [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], and [[percussion instrument]]s, each grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the [[piano]] and [[celesta]] may sometimes appear in a fifth [[keyboard section]] or may stand alone, as may the [[concert harp]] and, for performances of some modern compositions, [[electronic musical instrument|electronic instruments]].

A full-size orchestra may sometimes be called a ''symphony orchestra'' or ''philharmonic orchestra''. The actual number of musicians employed in a given performance may vary from seventy to over one hundred musicians, depending on the work being played and the size of the venue. The term ''chamber orchestra'' (and sometimes ''concert orchestra'') usually refers to smaller-sized ensembles of about fifty musicians or fewer.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Orchestras that specialize in the [[Baroque music]] of, for example, [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]], or [[Classical music period|Classical]] repertoire, such as that of [[Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], tend to be smaller than orchestras performing a [[Romantic music]] repertoire,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} such as the [[symphonies]] of [[Johannes Brahms]]. The typical orchestra grew in size throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, reaching a peak with the large orchestras (of as many as 120 players) called for in the works of [[Richard Wagner]], and later, [[Gustav Mahler]].

Orchestras are usually led by a [[Conducting|conductor]] who directs the performance with movements of the hands and arms, often made easier for the musicians to see by use of a [[conductor's baton]]. The conductor unifies the orchestra, sets the [[tempo]] and shapes the sound of the ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|section=Conducting|title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music|authors=Michael Kennedy &amp; Joyce Bourne Kennedy|edition=Fifth|publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford|date=2007|isbn=978-0199203833}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conductor also prepares the orchestra by leading rehearsals before the public concert, in which the conductor provides instructions to the musicians on their interpretation of the music being performed.

The leader of the first violin section, commonly called the [[concertmaster]], also plays an important role in leading the musicians. In the [[Baroque music]] era (1600–1750), orchestras were often led by the concertmaster or by a chord-playing musician performing the [[basso continuo]] parts on a [[harpsichord]] or [[pipe organ]], a tradition that some 20th century and 21st century [[early music]] ensembles continue. Orchestras play a wide range of repertoire, including symphonies, [[opera]] and [[ballet]] [[overture]]s, [[concerto]]s for solo instruments, and as [[pit orchestra|pit ensembles]] for [[opera]]s, [[ballet]]s, and some types of [[musical theatre]] (e.g., [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] [[operetta]]s).

Amateur orchestras include those made up of students from an elementary school or a high school, [[youth orchestra]]s, and community orchestras; the latter two typically being made up of amateur musicians from a particular city or region.

The term ''orchestra'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ὀρχήστρα (''orchestra''), the name for the area in front of a stage in [[ancient Greek theatre]] reserved for the [[Greek chorus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%29rxh%2Fstra ὀρχήστρα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
[[File:Ancasta-LaViottiChamberOrchestraMozartKV136.ogv|thumb|upright=1.25|Viotti Chamber Orchestra performing the 3rd movement of [[Mozart]]'s ''Divertimento in [[D Major]]'' (K136)]]

The typical symphony orchestra consists of four groups of related [[musical instrument]]s called the [[woodwind section|woodwinds]], [[brass section|brass]], [[percussion section|percussion]], and [[string section|strings]] ([[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]] and [[double bass]]). Other instruments such as the [[piano]] and [[celesta]] may sometimes be grouped into a fifth section such as a [[keyboard section]] or may stand alone, as may the [[concert harp]] and [[electronic music|electric and electronic]] instruments. The orchestra, depending on the size, contains almost all of the standard instruments in each group.

In the history of the orchestra, its instrumentation has been expanded over time, often agreed to have been standardized by the classical period&lt;ref&gt;Jack Westrup, "Instrumentation and Orchestration: 3. 1750 to 1800", New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd ed., edited by Stanley Sadie (New York: Grove, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s influence on the classical model.&lt;ref&gt;D. Kern Holoman, "Instrumentation and Orchestration: 4. 19th Century", in ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th and 21st century, new repertory demands expanded the instrumentation of the orchestra, resulting in a flexible use of the classical-model instruments and newly developed [[electric instrument|electric]] and [[electronic instrument]]s in various combinations.

The terms ''symphony orchestra'' and ''philharmonic orchestra'' may be used to distinguish different ensembles from the same locality, such as the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]]. A symphony orchestra will usually have over eighty musicians on its roster, in some cases over a hundred, but the actual number of musicians employed in a particular performance may vary according to the work being played and the size of the venue.

''Chamber orchestra'' usually refers to smaller-sized ensembles; a major chamber orchestra might employ as many as fifty musicians; some are much smaller than that. The term ''concert orchestra'' may also be used, as in the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] and the [[RTÉ Concert Orchestra]].

===Beethoven's influence===
The so-called "standard complement" of doubled winds and brass in the orchestra from the first half of the 19th century is generally attributed to the forces called for by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The [[composer]]'s instrumentation almost always included paired [[Western concert flute|flutes]], [[oboe]]s, [[clarinet]]s, [[bassoon]]s, [[French horn|horns]] and [[trumpet]]s. The exceptions to this are his [[Symphony No. 4 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 4]], [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]], and [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Piano Concerto No. 4]], which each specify a single [[flute]]. Beethoven carefully calculated the expansion of this particular [[timbral]] "palette" in Symphonies 3, 5, 6, and 9 for an innovative effect. The third horn in the [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|"Eroica"]] Symphony arrives to provide not only some harmonic flexibility, but also the effect of "choral" brass in the Trio movement. [[Piccolo]], [[contrabassoon]], and [[trombone]]s add to the triumphal finale of his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]]. A piccolo and a pair of trombones help deliver the effect of storm and sunshine in the [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth]], also known as the ''Pastoral Symphony''. The [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth]] asks for a second pair of horns, for reasons similar to the "Eroica" (four horns has since become standard); Beethoven's use of piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and untuned [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]—plus [[choir|chorus]] and vocal soloists—in his finale, are his earliest suggestion that the timbral boundaries of symphony might be expanded. For several decades after his death, symphonic [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]] was faithful to Beethoven's well-established model, with few exceptions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Expanded instrumentation===
{{refimprove-section|date=November 2017}}
Apart from the core orchestral complement, various other instruments are called for occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Hopkins and Paul Griffiths, "Instrumentation and Orchestration: 5. Impression and Later Developments", in ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; These include the [[flugelhorn]] and [[cornet]]. [[Saxophone]]s and [[classical guitar]]s, for example, appear in some 19th- through 21st-century scores. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example [[Maurice Ravel]]'s orchestration of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]'', the saxophone is included in other works, such as Ravel's ''[[Boléro]]'', [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)#Orchestral suites extracted from Romeo and Juliet|Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2]], [[Vaughan Williams]]' Symphonies [[Symphony No. 6 (Vaughan Williams)|No.6]] and [[Symphony No. 9 (Vaughan Williams)|9]] and [[William Walton]]'s [[Belshazzar's Feast (Walton)|''Belshazzar's Feast'']], and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. The [[euphonium]] is featured in a few late [[Romantic music|Romantic]] and [[20th-century classical music|20th-century]] works, usually playing parts marked "tenor tuba", including [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', and [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]''. The [[Wagner tuba]], a modified member of the horn family, appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and several other works by Strauss, [[Béla Bartók]], and others; it has a prominent role in [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 7 in E Major]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wagner-tuba.com/ |title=The Wagner Tuba |publisher=The Wagner Tuba |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornets appear in [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'', [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[La Mer (Debussy)|La Mer]]'', and several orchestral works by [[Hector Berlioz]]. Unless these instruments are played by members "doubling" on another instrument (for example, a trombone player changing to euphonium or a bassoon player switching to [[contrabassoon]] for a certain passage), orchestras typically hire [[freelance]] musicians to augment their regular ensemble.

The 20th-century orchestra was far more flexible than its predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Hopkins and Paul Griffiths, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; In Beethoven's and [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s time, the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments, which was very rarely modified by composers. As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as Berlioz and Mahler; some composers used multiple harps and [[sound effect]] such as the [[wind machine]]. During the 20th century, the modern orchestra was generally standardized with the modern instrumentation listed below. Nevertheless, by the mid- to late 20th century, with the development of [[contemporary classical music]], instrumentation could practically be hand-picked by the composer (e.g., to add [[electric instrument]]s such as [[electric guitar]], [[electronic instrument]]s such as [[synthesizer]]s, non-Western instruments, or other instruments not traditionally used in orchestra).

With this history in mind, the orchestra can be analysed in five periods: the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]], the [[Classical music period]], early/mid-[[Romantic music]] era, late-Romantic/early [[20th century music]] and [[Contemporary classical music|21st century era]]. The first is a [[Baroque music|Baroque]] orchestra (i.e., [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]], [[Handel]], [[Vivaldi]]), which generally had a smaller number of performers, and in which one or more chord-playing instruments, the [[basso continuo]] group (e.g., [[harpsichord]] or [[pipe organ]] and assorted bass instruments to perform the [[bassline]]), played an important role; the second is a typical classical period orchestra (e.g., early [[Beethoven]] along with [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]), which used a smaller group of performers than a [[Romantic music]] orchestra and a fairly standardized instrumentation; the third is typical of an early/mid-Romantic era (e.g., [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]); the fourth is a late-Romantic/early 20th century orchestra (e.g., [[Wagner]], [[Brahms]], [[Mahler]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]), to the common complement of a 2010-era modern orchestra (e.g., [[John Adams (composer)|Adams]], [[Samuel Barber|Barber]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Philip Glass|Glass]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki|Penderecki]]).

==Organization==
[[File:Laredo Philharmonic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Conducting an orchestra]]
Among the instrument groups and within each group of instruments, there is a generally accepted hierarchy. Every instrumental group (or section) has a '''principal''' who is generally responsible for leading the group and playing orchestral solos. The violins are divided into two groups, first violin and second violin, with the second violins playing in lower registers than the first violins, playing an [[accompaniment]] part, or harmonizing the melody played by the first violins. The principal first violin is called the [[concertmaster]] (or "leader" in the UK) and is not only considered the leader of the string section, but the second-in-command of the entire orchestra, behind only the [[Conducting|conductor]].  The concertmaster leads the pre-concert [[musical tuning|tuning]] and handles musical aspects of orchestra management, such as determining the bowings for the violins or for all of the string section. The concertmaster usually sits to the conductor's left, closest to the audience. There is also a principal second violin, a principal viola, a principal cello and a principal bass.

The principal trombone is considered the leader of the low brass section, while the principal trumpet is generally considered the leader of the entire brass section. While the oboe often provides the tuning note for the orchestra (due to 300-year-old convention), no principal is the leader of the woodwind section though in woodwind ensembles, often the flute is leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pom.sagepub.com/content/31/1/53.short |title=An Investigation of Members' Roles in Wind Quintets |journal=Psychology of Music |volume=31 |pages=53–74 |date=2003-01-01 |accessdate=2014-06-04|doi=10.1177/0305735603031001323 |last1=Ford |first1=Luan |last2=Davidson |first2=Jane W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, each principal confers with the others as equals in the case of musical differences of opinion. Most sections also have an assistant principal (or co-principal or associate principal), or in the case of the first violins, an assistant concertmaster, who often plays a [[tutti]] part in addition to replacing the principal in his or her absence.

A section string player plays in [[unison]] with the rest of the section, except in the case of divided (''divisi'') parts, where upper and lower parts in the music are often assigned to "outside" (nearer the audience) and "inside" seated players. Where a solo part is called for in a string section, the section leader invariably plays that part. The section leader (or principal) of a string section is also responsible for determining the bowings, often based on the bowings set out by the concertmaster. In some cases, the principal of a string section may use a slightly different bowing than the concertmaster, to accommodate the requirements of playing their instrument (e.g., the double-bass section). Principals of a string section will also lead entrances for their section, typically by lifting the bow before the entrance, to ensure the section plays together. Tutti wind and brass players generally play a unique but non-solo part. Section percussionists play parts assigned to them by the principal percussionist.

In modern times, the musicians are usually directed by a [[Conducting|conductor]], although early orchestras did not have one, giving this role instead to the [[concertmaster]] or the [[harpsichord]]ist playing the [[Basso Continuo|continuo]]. Some modern orchestras also do [[Conductorless orchestra|without conductors]], particularly smaller orchestras and those specializing in historically accurate (so-called "period") performances of [[baroque music|baroque]] and earlier music.

The most frequently performed repertoire for a [[symphony]] orchestra is Western [[European classical music|classical music]] or [[opera]]. However, orchestras are used sometimes in [[popular music]] (e.g., to accompany a rock or pop band in a concert), extensively in [[film music]], and increasingly often in [[video game music]]. Orchestras are also used in the [[symphonic metal]] genre. The term "orchestra" can also be applied to a jazz ensemble, for example in the performance of [[big band|big-band]] music.

===Selection and appointment of members===
In the 2000s, all tenured members of a professional orchestra normally [[audition]] for positions in the ensemble.&lt;!--Personal friends of the conductor and pals of principal players are exempted from this rule :)--&gt; Performers typically play one or more solo pieces of the auditionee's choice, such as a movement of a [[concerto]], a solo [[J.S. Bach|Bach]] movement, and a variety of excerpts from the orchestral literature that are advertised in the audition poster (so the auditionees can prepare). The excerpts are typically the most technically challenging parts and solos from the orchestral literature. Orchestral auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the [[conductor (music)|conductor]], the [[concertmaster]], the principal player of the section for which the auditionee is applying and possibly other principal players and regular orchestra members.

The most promising candidates from the first round of auditions are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to [[sight read]] orchestral music. The final stage of the audition process in some orchestras is a ''test week'', in which the performer plays with the orchestra for a week or two, which allows the conductor and principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual rehearsal and performance setting.

There are a range of different employment arrangements. The most sought-after positions are permanent, [[tenure]]d positions in the orchestra. Orchestras also hire musicians on contracts, ranging in length from a single concert to a full season or more. Contract performers may be hired for individual concerts when the orchestra is doing an exceptionally large late-Romantic era orchestral work, or to substitute for a permanent member who is sick. A professional musician who is hired to perform for a single concert is sometimes called a "sub". Some contract musicians may be hired to replace permanent members for the period that the permanent member is on [[parental leave]] or [[disability]] leave.

====Sex of ensembles====
Historically, major professional orchestras have been mostly or entirely composed of male musicians. The first [[women in music|female members hired in professional orchestras]] have been [[harp]]ists. The [[Vienna Philharmonic]], for example, did not accept women to permanent membership until 1997, far later than comparable orchestras (the other orchestras ranked among the world’s top five by ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' in 2008).&lt;ref name="The world’s greatest orchestras"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/editorial/the-world%E2%80%99s-greatest-orchestras |title=The world's greatest orchestras |work=gramophone.co.uk |date= 2012-10-24|accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last major orchestra to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the [[Berlin Philharmonic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James R. Oestreich]], [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/berlin-in-lights-the-woman-question/ "Berlin in Lights: The Woman Question"], Arts Beat, ''The New York Times'', 16 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1996, the Vienna Philharmonic's principal flute, Dieter Flury, told ''[[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]]'' that accepting women would be "gambling with the emotional unity ({{Lang|de|emotionelle Geschlossenheit}}) that this organism currently has".&lt;ref name=WDR5&gt;Westdeutscher Rundfunk Radio 5, "Musikalische Misogynie", 13 February 1996, [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdrgerm.htm transcribed by Regina Himmelbauer]; [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdr.htm translation by William Osborne]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1996, the orchestra’s press secretary wrote that "compensating for the expected leaves of absence" of [[maternity leave]] would be a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/posts/schuster.htm |title=The Vienna Philharmonic's Letter of Response to the Gen-Mus List |work=Osborne-conant.org |date=1996-02-25 |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the Vienna Philharmonic was "facing protests during a [US] tour" by the [[National Organization for Women]] and the [[International Alliance for Women in Music]]. Finally, "after being held up to increasing ridicule even in socially conservative Austria, members of the orchestra gathered [on 28 February 1997] in an extraordinary meeting on the eve of their departure and agreed to admit a woman, Anna Lelkes, as harpist."&lt;ref name=JP&gt;Jane Perlez, [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/28/world/vienna-philharmonic-lets-women-join-in-harmony.html "Vienna Philharmonic Lets Women Join in Harmony”], ''The New York Times'', February 28, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the orchestra has six female members; one of them, violinist Albena Danailova, became one of the orchestra’s [[concertmaster]]s in 2008, the first woman to hold that position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france24.com/en/20080508-vienna-opera-albena-danailova-first-female-concertmaster-austria&amp;navi=CULTURE Vienna opera appoints first ever female concertmaster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028131919/http://www.france24.com/en/20080508-vienna-opera-albena-danailova-first-female-concertmaster-austria%26navi%3DCULTURE |date=2013-10-28 }}, [[France 24]]&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, women made up 6% of the orchestra's membership. VPO president Clemens Hellsberg said the VPO now uses completely screened [[blind audition]]s.&lt;ref name=Legends&gt;James R. Oestrich, [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/28/arts/even-legends-adjust-to-time-and-trend-even-the-vienna.html "Even Legends Adjust To Time and Trend, Even the Vienna Philharmonic"], ''The New York Times'', 28 February 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, an article in ''Mother Jones'' stated that while "[m]any prestigious orchestras have significant female membership—women outnumber men in the [[New York Philharmonic]]'s violin section—and several renowned ensembles, including the [[National Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Detroit Symphony]], and the Minnesota Symphony, are led by women violinists", the [[double bass]], brass, and percussion sections of major orchestras "...are still predominantly male."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hannah Levintova |url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/09/women-conductors-gap-charts-marin-alsop-proms |title=Here's Why You Seldom See Women Leading a Symphony |publisher=Mother Jones |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 BBC article stated that the "...introduction of [[Blind audition|‘blind’ auditions]], where a prospective instrumentalist performs behind a screen so that the judging panel can exercise no gender or racial prejudice, has seen the gender balance of traditionally male-dominated symphony orchestras gradually shift."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burton |first=Clemency |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20130821-why-so-few-women-conductors |title=Culture – Why aren't there more women conductors? |publisher=BBC |date=2014-10-21 |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amateur ensembles==
There are also a variety of amateur orchestras:
* School orchestras: These orchestras consist of students from an elementary or secondary school. They may be students from a music class or program or they may be drawn from the entire school body. School orchestras are typically led by a [[music teacher]].
* University or conservatory orchestras: These orchestras consist of students from a university or music conservatory. In some cases, university orchestras are open to all students from a university, from all programs. Larger universities may have two or more university orchestras: one or more orchestras made up of music majors (or, for major music programs, several tiers of music major orchestras, ranked by skill level) and a second orchestra open to university students from all academic programs (e.g., science, business, etc.) who have previous classical music experience on an orchestral instrument. University and conservatory orchestras are led by a conductor who is typically a [[professor]] or instructor at the university or conservatory.
* [[Youth orchestra]]s: These orchestras consist of teens and young adults drawn from an entire city or region. The age range in youth orchestras varies between different ensembles. In some cases, youth orchestras may consist of teens or young adults from an entire country (e.g., Canada's National Youth Orchestra).
* Community orchestras: These orchestras consist of amateur performers drawn from an entire city or region. Community orchestras typically consist mainly of adult amateur musicians. Community orchestras range in level from beginner-level orchestras which rehearse music without doing formal performances in front of an audience to intermediate-level ensembles to advanced amateur groups which play standard professional orchestra repertoire. In some cases, university or conservatory music students may also be members of community orchestras. While community orchestra members are mostly unpaid amateurs, in some orchestras, a small number of professionals may be hired to act as principal players and section leaders.

==Repertoire and performances==
Orchestras play a wide range of repertoire ranging from 17th-century [[Baroque music#Dance suite|dance suites]], 18th century [[divertimento]]s to 20th century [[film score]]s and 21st-century symphonies. Orchestras have become synonymous with the [[symphony]], an extended [[musical composition]] in Western [[classical music]] that typically contains multiple movements which provide contrasting keys and tempos. Symphonies are notated in a [[Full score|musical score]], which contains all the instrument parts. The [[conducting|conductor]] uses the score to study the symphony before rehearsals and decide on their interpretation (e.g., tempos, articulation, phrasing, etc.), and to follow the music during rehearsals and concerts, while leading the ensemble. Orchestral musicians play from parts containing just the notated music for their instrument. A small number of symphonies also contain vocal parts (e.g., [[Beethoven]]'s [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|Ninth Symphony]]).

Orchestras also perform [[overture]]s, a term originally applied to the instrumental introduction to an opera.&lt;ref name="Blom 1954"&gt;Blom 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; During the early Romantic era, composers such as [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] began to use the term to refer to independent, self-existing instrumental, programmatic works that presaged genres such as the [[symphonic poem]], a form devised by [[Franz Liszt]] in several works that began as dramatic overtures. These were "at first undoubtedly intended to be played at the head of a programme".&lt;ref name="Blom 1954"/&gt; In the 1850s the concert overture began to be supplanted by the symphonic poem.

Orchestras also play with instrumental soloists in [[concerto]]s. During concertos, the orchestra plays an [[accompaniment]] role to the soloist (e.g., a solo violinist or pianist) and, at times, introduces musical themes or interludes while the soloist is not playing. Orchestras also play during [[opera]]s, [[ballet]]s, some musical theatre works and some choral works (both sacred works such as Masses and secular works). In operas and ballets, the orchestra accompanies the singers and dancers, respectively, and plays overtures and interludes where the melodies played by the orchestra take centre stage.

===Performances===

In the Baroque era, orchestras performed in a range of venues, including at the fine houses of aristocrats, in opera halls and in churches. Some wealthy aristocrats had an orchestra in residence at their estate, to entertain them and their guests with performances. During the Classical era, as composers increasing sought out financial support from the general public, orchestra concerts were increasingly held in public concert halls, where music lovers could buy tickets to hear the orchestra. Of course, aristocratic patronage of orchestras continued during the Classical era, but this went on alongside public concerts. In the 20th and 21st century, orchestras found a new patron: governments. Many orchestras in North America and Europe receive part of their funding from national, regional level governments (e.g., state governments in the U.S.) or city governments. These government subsidies make up part of orchestra revenue, along with ticket sales, charitable donations (if the orchestra is a registered as a charity) and other fundraising activities. With the invention of successive technologies, including [[sound recording]], [[radio broadcasting]], [[television broadcasting]] and [[Internet]]-based [[Streaming video|streaming]] and downloading of concert videos, orchestras have been able to find new revenue sources.

===Issues in performance===
====Faking====
{{Main|Faking (Western classical music)}}
One of the "great unmentionable [topics] of orchestral playing" is "faking", the process by which an orchestral musician gives the "...impression of playing every note as written", typically for a very challenging passage that is very high or very fast, while not actually playing the notes that are in the printed music part.&lt;ref name="thestrad.com"&gt;McVeigh, Alice. "Faking it – the great unmentionable of orchestral playing" in ''The Strad'', June 2006. http://www.thestrad.com/faking-it-the-great-unmentionable-of-orchestral-playing/&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''[[The Strad]]'' states that all orchestral musicians, even those in the top orchestras, occasionally "fake" certain passages.&lt;ref name="thestrad.com"/&gt; One reason that musicians "fake" is because there are not enough rehearsals.&lt;ref name="thestrad.com"/&gt; Another factor is the extreme challenges in 20th century and 21st century contemporary pieces; professionals interviewed by the magazine said "faking" was "...necessary in anything from ten to almost ninety per cent of some modern works.&lt;ref name="thestrad.com"/&gt; Professional players who were interviewed were of a consensus that faking may be acceptable when a part is not written well for the instrument, but faking "just because you haven’t practised" the music is not acceptable.&lt;ref name="thestrad.com"/&gt;

==History==

===Instrumental technology===
[[File:Philadelphia Orchestra at American premiere of Mahler's 8th Symphony (1916).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Leopold Stokowski|Stokowski]] and the Philadelphia Orchestra at the March 2, 1916 American premiere of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s [[Symphony of a Thousand|8th Symphony]].]]
The invention of the piston and rotary valve by [[Heinrich Stölzel]] and [[Friedrich Blühmel]], both [[Silesians]], in 1815, was the first in a series of innovations which impacted the orchestra, including the development of modern keywork for the flute by [[Theobald Boehm]] and the innovations of [[Adolphe Sax]] in the woodwinds, notably the invention of the [[saxophone]]. These advances would lead [[Hector Berlioz]] to write a landmark book on [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], which was the first systematic treatise on the use of instrumental sound as an expressive element of music.&lt;ref&gt;Hector Berlioz. ''Traite d'instrumentation et d'orchestration'' (Paris: Lemoine, 1843).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wagner's influence===

The next major expansion of symphonic practice came from [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth]] orchestra, founded to accompany his musical dramas. Wagner's works for the stage were scored with unprecedented scope and complexity: indeed, his score to ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' calls for six [[harp]]s. Thus, Wagner envisioned an ever-more-demanding role for the conductor of the theatre orchestra, as he elaborated in his influential work ''On Conducting''.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wagner. ''On Conducting (Ueber das Dirigiren), a treatise on style in the execution of classical music'' (London: W. Reeves, 1887).&lt;/ref&gt; This brought about a revolution in orchestral [[Musical composition|composition]], and set the style for orchestral performance for the next eighty years. Wagner's theories re-examined the importance of [[tempo]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], bowing of string instruments and the role of principals in the orchestra. Conductors who studied his methods would go on to be influential themselves.{{Vague|date=December 2015}}&lt;!--Surely not every conductor who studied these methods became influential.--&gt;

===20th&amp;nbsp;century orchestra===
As the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century dawned, symphony orchestras were larger, better funded, and better trained than ever before; consequently, composers could compose larger and more ambitious works. The influence of [[Gustav Mahler]] was particularly innovational; in his later symphonies, such as the mammoth [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Symphony No.&amp;nbsp;8]], Mahler pushes the furthest boundaries of orchestral size, employing huge forces. By the late Romantic era, orchestras could support the most enormous forms of symphonic expression, with huge string sections, massive brass sections and an expanded range of percussion instruments. With the recording era beginning, the standards of performance were pushed to a new level, because a recorded symphony could be listened to closely and even minor errors in intonation or ensemble, which might not be noticeable in a live performance, could be heard by critics. As recording technologies improved over the 20th and 21st centuries, eventually small errors in a recording could be "fixed" by audio editing or [[overdubbing]]. Some older conductors and composers could remember a time when simply "getting through" the music as best as possible was the standard. Combined with the wider audience made possible by recording, this led to a renewed focus on particular star conductors and on a high standard of orchestral execution.&lt;ref&gt;See Lance W. Brunner. (1986). "The Orchestra and Recorded Sound", pp.&amp;nbsp;479–532 in Joan Peyser Ed. ''The Orchestra: Origins and Transformations'', New York: Scribner's Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counter-revolution===
With the advent of the early music movement, smaller orchestras where players worked on execution of works in styles derived from the study of older treatises on playing became common. These include the [[Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment]], the [[London Classical Players]] under the direction of Sir [[Roger Norrington]] and the [[Academy of Ancient Music]] under [[Christopher Hogwood]], among others.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Recent trends in the United States===
In the United States, the late 20th century saw a crisis of funding and support for orchestras. The size and cost of a symphony orchestra, compared to the size of the base of supporters, became an issue that struck at the core of the institution. Few orchestras could fill auditoriums, and the time-honored season-subscription system became increasingly anachronistic, as more and more listeners would buy tickets on an ad hoc basis for individual events. Orchestral endowments and—more centrally to the daily operation of American orchestras—orchestral donors have seen investment portfolios shrink or produce lower yields, reducing the ability of donors to contribute; further, there has been a trend toward donors finding other social causes more compelling. Also, while government funding is less central to American than European orchestras, cuts in such funding are still significant for American ensembles. Finally, the drastic falling-off of revenues from recording, tied to no small extent to changes in the recording industry itself, began a period of change that has yet to reach its conclusion.

U.S. orchestras that have gone into Chapter 11 bankruptcy include the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] (in April 2011), and the [[Louisville Orchestra]], in December 2010; orchestras that have gone into Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have ceased operations include the [[Northwest Chamber Orchestra]] in 2006, the [[Honolulu Orchestra]] in March 2011, the [[New Mexico Symphony Orchestra]] in April 2011, and the [[Syracuse Symphony]] in June 2011. The Festival of Orchestras in Orlando, Florida ceased operations at the end of March, 2011.

One source of financial difficulties that received notice and criticism was high salaries for music directors of US orchestras,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/arts/music/ronald-wilford-manager-of-legendary-maestros-dies-at-87.html | title=Ronald Wilford, Manager of Legendary Maestros, Dies at 87 | work=The New York Times | author=Michael Cooper | date=2015-06-13 | accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led several high-profile conductors to take pay cuts in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2009/03/cleveland_orchestra_plans_deep.html | title=Cleveland Orchestra plans 'deep' cuts; Welser-Most takes pay cut | work=Cleveland Plain Dealer | author=Zachary Lewis | date=2009-03-24 | accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/21/entertainment/la-ca-leonard-slatkin-20110821 | title=He conducts himself well through crises | work=Los Angeles Times | author=Donna Perlmutter | date=2011-08-21 | accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.startribune.com/april-25-osmo-vnsk-hires-on-to-rebuild-orchestra/256589871/ | title=Osmo Vänskä hires on to rebuild Minnesota Orchestra | work=Minneapolis Star-Tribune | author=Graydon Royce | date=2014-05-09 | accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Music administrators such as [[Michael Tilson Thomas]] and [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]] argued that new music, new means of presenting it, and a renewed relationship with the community could revitalize the symphony orchestra. The American critic [[Greg Sandow]] has argued in detail that orchestras must revise their approach to music, performance, the concert experience, marketing, public relations, community involvement, and presentation to bring them in line with the expectations of 21st-century audiences immersed in popular culture.

It is not uncommon for contemporary composers to use unconventional instruments, including various synthesizers, to achieve desired effects. Many, however, find more conventional orchestral configuration to provide better possibilities for color and depth. Composers like [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] often employ Romantic-size orchestras, as in Adams' opera ''[[Nixon in China (opera)|Nixon in China]]''; [[Philip Glass]] and others may be more free, yet still identify size-boundaries. Glass in particular has recently turned to conventional orchestras in works like the ''[[Cello Concerto No. 1 (Glass)|Concerto for Cello and Orchestra]]'' and the [[Violin Concerto No. 2 (Glass)|Violin Concerto No. 2]].

Along with a decrease in funding, some U.S. orchestras have reduced their overall personnel, as well as the number of players appearing in performances. The reduced numbers in performance are usually confined to the [[string section]], since the numbers here have traditionally been flexible (as multiple players typically play from the same part).

==Role of conductor==
{{Main|Conducting}}
[[File:Taipei.apo-hsu.altonthompson.jpg|thumb|[[Apo Hsu]], using a [[baton (conducting)|baton]], conducts the [[National Taiwan Normal University|NTNU Symphony Orchestra]] in Taipei, Taiwan]]

Conducting is the art of directing a [[music]]al performance, such as an orchestral or [[Choir|choral]] [[concert]]. The primary duties of the conductor are to set the [[tempo]], ensure correct entries by various members of the ensemble, and to "shape" the phrasing where appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote="Conducting"|title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music|authors=[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]] and Joyce Bourne Kennedy|edition=Fifth|publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford|date=2007|isbn=978-0199203833}}&lt;/ref&gt; To convey their ideas and interpretation, a conductor communicates with their musicians primarily through hand gestures, typically though not invariably with the aid of a [[Baton (conducting)|baton]], and may use other gestures or signals, such as eye contact with relevant performers.&lt;ref name=CambComp3&gt;Holden, Raymond: "The technique of conducting", p. 3 in ''The Cambridge Companion to Conducting" ed. José Antonio Bowen&lt;/ref&gt; A conductor's directions will almost invariably be supplemented or reinforced by verbal instructions or suggestions to their musicians in rehearsal prior to a performance.&lt;ref name=CambComp3/&gt;

The conductor typically stands on a raised podium with a large music stand for the [[full score]], which contains the [[musical notation]] for all the instruments and voices. Since the mid-18th century, most conductors have not played an instrument when conducting,{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} although in earlier periods of [[classical music]] history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. In [[Baroque music]] from the 1600s to the 1750s, the group would typically be led by the [[harpsichord]]ist or first violinist (see [[concertmaster]]), an approach that in modern times has been revived by several music directors for music from this period. Conducting while playing a [[piano]] or [[synthesizer]] may also be done with musical theatre [[pit orchestra]]s. Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in [[art music]], but in jazz big bands or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions, such as a "count in"). However, in [[rehearsal]]s, frequent interruptions allow the conductor to give verbal directions as to how the music should be played or sung.

Conductors act as guides to the orchestras or choirs they conduct. They choose the works to be performed and study their [[sheet music|scores]], to which they may make certain adjustments (e.g., regarding tempo, articulation, phrasing, repetitions of sections, and so on), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the performers. They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musiced.about.com/od/musiccareer1/p/theconductor.htm |title=About.com: The Conductor |accessdate=2016-08-30 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415012250/http://musiced.about.com/od/musiccareer1/p/theconductor.htm |archivedate=April 15, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; planning a concert season, hearing [[audition]]s and selecting members, and promoting their ensemble in the media. Orchestras, [[choir]]s, [[concert band]]s and other sizable [[musical ensemble]]s such as [[big band]]s are usually led by conductors.

===Conductorless orchestras===
{{Main article|Conductorless orchestra}}
In the [[Baroque music]] era (1600–1750), most orchestras were led by one of the musicians, typically the principal first violin, called the [[concertmaster]]. The concertmaster would lead the tempo of pieces by lifting his or her bow in a rhythmic manner. Leadership might also be provided by one of the chord-playing instrumentalists playing the [[basso continuo]] part which was the core of most Baroque instrumental ensemble pieces. Typically, this would be a [[harpsichord]] player, a [[pipe organ]]ist or a [[lute]]ist or [[theorbo]] player. A keyboard player could lead the ensemble with his or her head, or by taking one of the hands off the keyboard to lead a more difficult tempo change. A lutenist or theorbo player could lead by lifting the instrument neck up and down to indicate the tempo of a piece, or to lead a [[ritard]] during a cadence or ending. In some works which combined [[choir]]s and instrumental ensembles, two leaders were sometimes used: a concertmaster to lead the instrumentalists and a chord-playing performer to lead the singers. During the [[Classical music period]] (ca. 1720–1800), the practice of using chordal instruments to play basso continuo was gradually phased out, and it disappeared completely by 1800. Instead, ensembles began to use conductors to lead the orchestra's tempos and playing style, while the concertmaster played an additional leadership role for the musicians, especially the string players, who imitate the bowstroke and playing style of the concertmaster, to the degree that is feasible for the different stringed instruments.

In 1922, the idea of a conductor-less orchestra was revived in post-[[revolution]]ary [[Soviet Union]]. The symphony orchestra [[Persimfans]] was formed without a conductor, because the founders believed that the ensemble should be modeled on the ideal [[Marxism|Marxist]] state, in which all people are equal. As such, its members felt that there was no need to be led by the dictatorial baton of a conductor; instead they were led by a [[committee]], which determined tempos and playing styles. Although it was a partial success within the Soviet Union, the principal difficulty with the concept was in changing [[tempo]] during performances, because even if the committee had issued a decree about where a tempo change should take place, there was no leader in the ensemble to guide this tempo change. The orchestra survived for ten years before [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] cultural politics disbanded it by taking away its funding.&lt;ref&gt;John Eckhard, "Orchester ohne Dirigent", ''Neue Zeitschrift für Musik'' 158, no. 2 (1997): 40–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western nations, some ensembles, such as the [[Orpheus Chamber Orchestra]], based in New York City, have had more success with conductorless orchestras, although decisions are likely to be deferred to some sense of leadership within the ensemble (for example, the principal wind and string players, notably the concertmaster). Others have returned to the tradition of a principal player, usually a violinist, being the artistic director and running rehearsal and leading concerts. Examples include the [[Australian Chamber Orchestra]], Amsterdam Sinfonietta &amp; Candida Thompson and the [[New Century Chamber Orchestra]]. As well, as part of the [[early music]] movement, some 20th and 21st century orchestras have revived the Baroque practice of having no conductor on the podium for Baroque pieces, using the concertmaster or a chord-playing [[basso continuo]] performer (e.g., harpsichord or organ) to lead the group.

===Multiple conductors===
====Offstage instruments====
Some orchestral works specify that an [[offstage trumpet]] should be used or that other instruments from the orchestra should be positioned off-stage or behind the stage, to create a haunted, mystical effect. To ensure that the offstage instrumentalist(s) play in time, sometimes a sub-conductor will be stationed offstage with a clear view of the principal conductor. Examples include the ending of "[[Neptune]]" from [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]''. The principal conductor leads the large orchestra, and the sub-conductor relays the principal conductor's tempo and gestures to the offstage musician (or musicians). One of the challenges with using two conductors is that the second conductor may get out of synchronization with the main conductor, or may mis-convey (or misunderstand) the principal conductor's gestures, which can lead to the offstage instruments being out of time. In the late 20th century and early 21st century, some orchestras use a [[video camera]] pointed at the principal conductor and a [[closed-circuit TV]] set in front of the offstage performer(s), instead of using two conductors.

====Contemporary music====
The techniques of [[polystylism]] and polytempo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greschak.com/polytempo/ |title=Polytempo Music Articles |publisher=Greschak.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20020820130701/http://www.greschak.com/polytempo/ |archivedate=2002-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; music have led a few 20th and 21st century composers to write music where multiple orchestras or ensembles perform simultaneously.  These trends have brought about the phenomenon of polyconductor music, wherein separate sub-conductors conduct each group of musicians.  Usually, one principal conductor conducts the sub-conductors, thereby shaping the overall performance. In [[Percy Grainger]]'s "[[The Warriors (Grainger)|The Warriors]]" which includes three conductors: the primary conductor of the orchestra, a secondary conductor directing an off-stage [[brass ensemble]], and a tertiary conductor directing percussion and harp. One example in the late century orchestral music is [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]'s [[Gruppen (Stockhausen)|''Gruppen'']], for three orchestras, which are placed around the audience. This way, the "sound masses" could be spacialized, as in an [[electroacoustic work]]. ''Gruppen'' was premiered in Cologne, in 1958, conducted by Stockhausen, [[Bruno Maderna]] and [[Pierre Boulez]]. It has been{{When|date=December 2015}}&lt;!--Wasn't this almost twenty years ago?--&gt; performed by [[Simon Rattle]], John Carewe and [[Daniel Harding]].

==Biography==

Oscar has worked at Dunder Mifflin for over nine years in 2008. He is openly [[Homosexuality|gay]] (after being publicly [[Outing|outed]] by Michael) and previously lived with his partner, Gil. Originally, Oscar was in [[the closet]], and Gil was believed to be his roommate. In earlier seasons, he is seen driving a [[Saturn Ion]].  This is the same Saturn that Angela can later be seen driving, such as in the episode "Niagara".  However, he is seen in the third season driving a [[Lexus RX 400h]], a company car he was lent as a result of his unwanted outing by Michael.

Though Oscar is openly gay in later episodes, in the episode "[[The Fire (The Office)|The Fire]]", when asked by Jim "Who would you do?", Oscar offers the answer, "Pam"; also, in "[[The Client (The Office)|The Client]]", he makes an intentionally vague reference to a woman he previously dated.

In a deleted scene from "[[Gay Witch Hunt]]", Oscar explains that he in fact notified Michael of his being gay during his job interview. This caused Michael to laugh repeatedly, and he hired Oscar on the spot because he was "the funniest person that [Michael] had ever met". Oscar then hid his sexuality from his co-workers (until he was outed) for fear of losing his job.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Luis Aldama  Latinos and Narrative Media: Participation and Portrayal 2013 1137361786- Page 16  "There is the Latino accountant, Óscar Martínez, on NBC's The Office (2005–2012), who is outted by his boss, Michael."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seasons 1–2===
In the episode "[[Diversity Day (The Office)|Diversity Day]]", Michael makes an example of Oscar in a diversity training seminar for his being Mexican. Michael annoys Oscar by stating the word "Mexican" might be offensive because it has "certain connotations". In "[[The Alliance (The Office)|The Alliance]]", Oscar goes around the office asking for donations for his nephew's [[walkathon]] for [[cerebral palsy]]. In "[[Basketball (The Office)|Basketball]]", Oscar asks to be on Michael's team; however, Michael assumes he is good at baseball and boxing, but not basketball.&lt;ref&gt;Season 1&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Oscar's favorite pastimes at work is playing a paper football game dubbed "Hateball" (because Angela hates it) with [[Kevin Malone]] whenever Michael isn't around. He keeps a two-year running total of their scores. Oscar enjoys [[ice skating]], likes the office thermostat to be set to a chilly 66 degrees, and dressed up in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] on [[Halloween (The Office)|"Halloween"]]. He has a conflict with [[Angela Martin]] over her poster of babies dressed as [[jazz]] musicians and claims it offends him more than "hardcore pornography." In "[[The Secret (The Office)|The Secret]]," Oscar calls in sick, but Dwight discovers that Oscar spent the day shopping and ice skating with his "roommate" Gil, but Dwight's naivete stops him realizing the truth about Oscar's sexuality, which is here revealed to the viewers, and again indicated in the episode "[[Valentine's Day (The Office)|Valentine's Day]]", when Oscar receives a gift and unconvincingly tells Kevin it is from his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Season 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seasons 3–4===
In the first episode of the third season, "[[Gay Witch Hunt]]", Michael obliviously calls Oscar "[[Faggot (epithet)|faggy]]" for preferring the film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' to ''[[Die Hard]]''. Oscar is understandably upset and reports it to corporate. When Michael realizes Oscar is actually gay, he tries to make it up to him and embraces some [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|gay culture]]. Michael calls a meeting and announces that Oscar is gay in front of the entire staff, much to Oscar's shock and dismay. In the conference room, to show no hard feelings, Michael hugs Oscar then proceeds to try to kiss him. Oscar is both disgusted and horrified by Michael's actions and proclaims it has been "the worst, most backwards day of my life."

To prevent Oscar from suing the company for [[anti-gay discrimination]], the corporate manager, [[Jan Levinson]], gives him a three-month paid vacation to Europe and use of a company car, a silver [[Lexus RX 400h]], replacing his gold [[Saturn Ion]].  After going on his vacation with Gil, Oscar returns briefly in "[[A Benihana Christmas]]," but decides that it is too soon and leaves before anyone notices him. Oscar finally returns to the office in "[[The Return (The Office)|The Return]]" and Michael decides to throw a Mexican themed party for him. Angela, who had acted cold towards him when he came out, apologizes and invites him to be a part of the party planning committee. He is also shown in [[Business School (The Office)|"Business School"]] with his partner Gil at Pam's art show, agreeing with Gil that, although it's her first try, Pam's art lacks courage and honesty, which she overhears.

In "[[Beach Games]]", Michael announces that the winner of his ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]''-style game will get his job. In an interview, Oscar states that if Dwight gets the position, he will transfer to [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. He also mentions that he is trying to get out of his relationship with Gil and that he "might [[heterosexuality|try women]] for a while; Angela thinks I can cross over."&lt;ref&gt;Season 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Fun Run]]", Kevin tries to use Oscar to see if Jim and Pam are dating. In a deleted scene, he says that he was raised [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], but now identifies as an [[agnostic]] [[Secular humanism|Secular Humanist]]. In "[[Money (The Office)|Money]]", Oscar helps Michael deal with his financial problems by going over his current finances. Oscar does this after Michael follows through with some bad advice from Creed, who advises Michael to declare bankruptcy will give him a clean financial state. With Pam and Toby, Oscar is a founding member of the Finer Things Club, which he refers to as the "gayest thing" about him "besides [[men who have sex with men|having sex with men]]".&lt;ref&gt;"[[Money (The Office)|Money]]", Season 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seasons 5–6===
Besides ice skating, Oscar is revealed to have an interest in [[yoga]].  In "[[Weight Loss (The Office)|Weight Loss]]", he refers [[Holly Flax|Holly]] to his yoga teacher whom she later dates.  For Halloween, he dresses  as [[Uncle Sam]]. And in [[Business Ethics (The Office)|Business Ethics]], he comes the closest to congratulating Pam and Jim for their engagement, by commenting that he had assumed they were already engaged.

In "[[Business Trip (The Office)|Business Trip]]", he travels to [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]] with Michael and Andy, with whom he bonds when they drink [[Long Island iced tea]]s.  Drunk, he questions Andy's desire to marry Angela and they [[drunk dial]] her.  In the morning, Oscar has rebuilt his reserve, but does thank Andy for trying to hook him up with two men in the hotel bar the previous night; however, by "[[Lecture Circuit]]", Oscar has returned to being dismissive of Andy and refuses to listen when Andy wants advice on asking out an attractive female customer. Oscar also shows a liking for [[egg salad sandwich]]es.

In "[[Stress Relief (The Office)|Stress Relief]]", during Dwight's over-the-top attempt to teach the office employees about fire safety, Oscar and everyone else are locked in the building, while under the impression that there is a fire. Oscar then attempts to escape by climbing into the ceiling, and is at first successful. However, his legs eventually fall through. Later, during a [[Roast (comedy)|roast]] held by Michael, Oscar severely roasts Michael, yelling at him in Spanish with the intent to make him cry (his comments, in English, amount to Oscar screaming that he can't believe has to drive for hours every day to work for someone like Michael) which succeeds after Oscar and the branch humiliate Michael. Oscar later regrets it and apologizes to Michael. Michael accepts the apology, but not without roasting Oscar by pointing out "You're gay", which Oscar seems to accept.

Oscar also finds himself at odds with Pam during "[[The Surplus]]" when he reveals a $4,300 budget surplus to Michael that he suggests could be used to purchase a new copier. Jim sides with him over the issue and they take Michael out to lunch to further their agenda. But Oscar finally concedes to Pam and agrees to buying new chairs like she wanted, ruining Michael's plans to keep 15% of the surplus for himself when the sides remained deadlocked past a deadline for using the entire amount.

In "[[Blood Drive (The Office)|Blood Drive]]," Oscar opens up during Michael's "Lonely Hearts Party" at the office about being rejected by a man who claimed not to be gay, but was later spotted on a date at a gay nightclub in Kansas City. Along with the staff, a sympathetic Oscar walks out with Michael after the holiday party is over, showing he can empathize with anyone.

Oscar wears sandals without socks in the office on "[[Casual Friday (The Office)|Casual Friday]]", which disgusts Angela and she objects to it. Oscar however, refuses to back down on Toby's request that he wear socks.

During the [[Company Picnic|company picnic]] when Meredith suggests forfeiting their volleyball game against corporate, an insightful Oscar points out that they need to go through with it, saying "Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked." after upper management decides to shut down the Buffalo branch after corporate hid the news.&lt;ref&gt;Season 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode "[[Gossip (The Office)|Gossip]]", Michael spreads rumors about various people throughout the Office, he tells everyone that Oscar is the voice of the [[Taco Bell dog]]. Oscar also helps Andy cope when a rumor is spread that he is gay. In "[[The Meeting (The Office)|The Meeting]]", Michael calls Oscar to his office to seek advice about his upcoming [[colonoscopy]] due to Michael thinking that it's going to be a lot like [[anal intercourse]] and feels Oscar would be well versed in that field, this makes Oscar visibly uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;Season 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Niagara (The Office)|Niagara]]", Pam's sister mistakes [[Kevin Malone|Kevin]] as Gil, Oscar's boyfriend, which greatly offends Oscar; Kevin is in turn insulted, telling Oscar that "he would be honored to be his boyfriend". In "[[Mafia (The Office)|Mafia]]", Oscar's psyche begins to crumble when Jim and Pam go on their honeymoon (they help maintain the "Coalition for Reason" in the office) and Michael, Dwight, Andy and Ryan began to believe that an [[Italian-American]] insurance salesman is in the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]]. So much so that, much to their anger, he calls them on their honeymoon in desperate need to talk to someone normal. He is further annoyed when Kevin, fearing that he [Kevin] will go to jail for committing [[identity theft]] against Jim, suggests that Oscar, being a homosexual, would "love" prison (because of the occurrence of male on male [[prison rape]] ).

In "[[Murder (The Office)|Murder]]", Oscar does not take part in Michael's murder mystery game, preferring to keep working and keeping tabs on what's going on with Dunder-Mifflin in the wake of bankruptcy rumors. He hears that Corporate has ordered Accounting to stop payments to vendors and tries to interrupt the game to tell Michael, only to have Michael stay in character rather than allow the game to be disrupted. He tries to deliver the news in as someone who would inhabit the game's world but can't figure out a way to do so and just says it plainly. In [[Shareholder Meeting]], he visits the company conference with Michael due to his annoyance at how poorly and inefficiently the company is being run, but refuses the chance to tell the board what he really thinks.

In "[[Secret Santa (The Office)|Secret Santa]]", Pam tries to play matchmaker, introducing the newly-single Oscar to the new gay warehouse worker Matt (played by [[Sam Daly]]). Oscar dismisses a nosy Pam and doesn't correct Matt when he calls him by the wrong name, Victor.  Later, he acts aloof and calls Matt by the wrong name.

In a deleted scene from "[[Happy Hour (The Office)|Happy Hour]]", Michael acts surprised when he is told it was Oscar who came up with the idea to go out, not aware Oscar set up the happy hour plan so he could get to spend more time with Matt in a social setting. When Oscar asks why Michael is so surprised, Kevin responds by telling Oscar that he's [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] and a [[snob]]; a claim which Oscar then justifies by stating he hates the [[Philadelphia Opera]]. In the aired episode, Daryl initially picks up Oscar's interest in Matt, telling Oscar "You can be gay with him--just be straight with me", and later Daryl bluntly says that Matt is a dummy and not worth Oscar's time, before he watches with bemusement as Oscar quickly runs off when Matt invites him to play an arcade basketball game.

===Seasons 7–8===
In "[[Costume Contest]]", Oscar points out that the contest's coveted prize, a coupon catalog, only provides the thousands of dollars of savings promised if the person buys a lot of things they do not really need. He then puts on a bland "rational consumer" outfit to mock the contest, but is stunned to learn that he won (mainly because Kelly and others voted for him out of surety he would lose), Ryan wanted to shake things up a la his support for [[Ralph Nader]], and Creed says it was "the best [[Edward James Olmos]] costume I've ever seen".

In "[[China (The Office)|China]]", Oscar's know-it-all tendencies come to the fore when he is wrong about a fact related to urban population centers in China—and Michael was right about it. Oscar then wants to have Michael meet him for coffee, which Jim recognizes is a way for "Mr. Actually" (Oscar) to get to have the last word and show Michael up on the facts about China. However, while Oscar does make some points Michael can't rebut, Michael still wins over a number of watching co-workers when he makes an emotional argument about the U.S. and China that Oscar isn't able to counter.

In "[[Classy Christmas]]", Oscar, who was already annoyed at Angela for constantly talking about her State Senator boyfriend, meets him and immediately says in an interview that "he's gay". Later on at the party, Ryan walks away from their group to make a drink, and the Senator clearly watches Ryan's backside as he leaves. Oscar notices this and turns the camera with a shocked expression.

In "[[The Seminar]]", Oscar and Pam help Erin when she plays a scrabble game against Gabe on her phone so that she can pick the movie she wants to watch with him (''[[Wall-E]]''). Before Oscar can type in the final word, Pam suggests that Erin should be the one to do it. Oscar reluctantly gives her the phone and hints that she should type the word "apoplexy". Erin ends up typing "ape", and Oscar is left frustrated.

In "[[PDA (The Office)|PDA]]", Oscar strongly disapproves of Michael and Holly's public displays of affection. Later on, after the two announce that they are moving in together, Oscar comes around and tells them to kiss. The kiss causes Kevin to say, "Suck on that, Oscar", and Oscar frustratedly points out that he was the one who told them to kiss. In "[[Garage Sale (The Office)|Garage Sale]]", Oscar tries to sell a vast collection of ''Will and Grace'' memorabilia he has gathered over the years due to people mistakingly thinking he's a fan of the show. He is also part of the group that helps Michael think of a good way to propose to Holly.

In "[[Michael's Last Dundies]]", Oscar laughs at Michael's portrayal of Angela in the opening video of the award show. He tells the camera (when referring to the movie) "the analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content". Later, he has a brief solo in the employees' [[a cappella]] version of "[[Seasons of Love]]" (with altered lyrics) that they sing to Michael (who is soon departing). In it, he sings that he forgives Michael for kissing him (which previously happened in the [[The Office (U.S. season 3)|third season]] premiere episode "[[Gay Witch Hunt]]").

In "[[Goodbye, Michael]]", Michael gives Oscar a miniature scarecrow figurine that he clearly made on his own, to symbolize the "[[brain]]" that Oscar gave to Michael, just like in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. In an interview, it was clearly intended as a joke on Michael's part, but Oscar accepts it as a serious gift. Oscar listens in as Angela shows off pictures of her and her boyfriend together, shaking his head at the fact the pictures hint heavily at the boyfriend being gay but Angela continues not to see it. In the extended version of the episode, Oscar says in a talking-head interview that Michael once asked him if "gay guys squeeze each other's boobs", and gives a little laugh while citing that he will never forget that.

In "[[Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager]]", Dwight makes everybody recite the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]. The camera focuses on Oscar during [[Criticism of the Pledge of Allegiance|the phrase "under God" which he does not say]].

Oscar finds himself on the "winners" side of new boss [[Robert California]]'s ([[James Spader]]) "[[The List (The Office)|List]]". Along with Jim, Oscar appears visibly uncomfortable when he finds this out.

During "[[The Incentive]]", Andy manages to rouse the staff into doubling sales by promising to get a tattoo of their choice, on Andy's buttocks. With the rest of the staff, Oscar joins in on the bet and is witness to Andy's tattoo at the shop.

In "[[Garden Party (The Office)|Garden Party]]", Oscar, along with other staff, listens to Andy's father verbally browbeat his son on Jim and Pam's baby monitor. With Darryl, they cheer Andy up with a barbecue. The two later confide in a talking head interview that they understand why Andy has a need to prove himself to everyone.

===Season 9===

In "[[New Guys]]", Angela pleads with Oscar to adopt her cat, Comstock, to which Oscar refuses and insists he's a dog person.  But when he learns that the cat is a favorite of her husband's, Oscar changes his mind and adopts Comstock. It's later implied that Oscar is having an affair with Robert, judging by a secretive phone call he makes to let him know of adopting Comstock.  In "[[The Boat (The Office)|The Boat]]", the affair is confirmed after the cameras catch Oscar kissing Robert. When Oscar sees that Kevin saw them, he goes to great lengths to ensure that Kevin keeps the secret, which he does.

In "[[The Whale (The Office)|The Whale]]", Angela confides to Oscar that she suspects Robert is cheating on her and they follow Robert to his gym. When Angela sees Robert making a call, after asking "who is he calling," and Oscar's phone begins to ring, she finally suspects that Oscar may be the one having an affair with Robert. In "[[The Target (The Office)|The Target]]", Angela seeks revenge on Oscar and hires a hitman to attack him but is talked out of it by Dwight. Oscar allows her to kick him in the shin instead. In "[[Vandalism (The Office)|Vandalism]]", Oscar and Angela compete uncomfortably for the affections of Robert at Angela's son's birthday party, but Oscar later suspects that Robert may have invited him only to boost Latino representation for his political campaign. Later, Oscar and Angela reconcile after he invites her to move in with him when she and Robert break up and she is evicted from her apartment.

In "[[Finale (The Office)|Finale]]", one year after the airing of the documentary, Oscar is revealed to be running for [[Pennsylvania State Senate]] (it is possible, but not explicitly stated, that Robert's re-election bid failed after he was outed by the documentary, meaning Oscar may be running for Robert's old seat) and he is the godfather of Angela and Dwight's son. Oscar also brings some of his old condescension to events around Dwight's wedding; at the dinner for Dwight and his old friends, when he learns that Andy has gotten a job at Cornell's Office of Admissions he assumes that it is volunteer work or an internship, leading Andy to somewhat annoyedly say that the job is a full-time paid position.

The '''pilot episode''', also known as '''''Northwest Passage''''', of the [[Mystery (fiction)|mystery]] television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' premiered on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Network]] on Sunday, April 8, 1990. It was written by series creators [[Mark Frost]] and [[David Lynch]], and directed by Lynch.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tv.com/shows/twin-peaks/pilot-northwest-passage-43982/&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot follows the characters of [[Dale Cooper]] and [[Harry S. Truman (Twin Peaks)|Harry S. Truman]] as they investigate the death of popular high school student [[Laura Palmer]]; Cooper believes the murder has connections to a murder case that occurred a year earlier. In addition to setting the tone for the show, the episode sets up several character and story arcs and marked the appearance of several recurring characters. The episode received a strong [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen household rating]] compared to other season one episodes and was well received by fans and critics alike. The original title for the series was ''Northwest Passage'', but this was later changed.

==Plot overview==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Pilot (Twin Peaks).jpg|thumb|left|[[Dale Cooper]] and Detective [[Harry S. Truman (Twin Peaks)|Harry S. Truman]] in an autopsy bay with [[Laura Palmer]]'s dead body]] --&gt;
The small northwest town of Twin Peaks, Washington is shaken when the body of [[Laura Palmer]] is discovered washed up on a riverbank, wrapped in plastic. [[FBI Special Agent]] [[Dale Cooper]] is called in when Ronnette Pulaski, who attended the same high school as Palmer, is found wandering on a bridge before lapsing into a coma. Cooper believes there is a connection between Palmer's death and the death of another girl named Teresa Banks that happened a year earlier. Cooper discovers a small piece of paper with the letter "R" on it shoved under Laura's fingernail. He tells Sheriff [[Harry S. Truman (Twin Peaks)|Harry S. Truman]] that under Banks's nail he found a "T". Meanwhile, the Palmer family and friends struggle to come to terms with her death, and wonder how it might have come about.

Believing that this is the same killer who struck the previous year, Cooper starts an official investigation. Meanwhile, the rebellious [[Audrey Horne]] ruins a business deal for her father [[Benjamin Horne]] ([[Richard Beymer]]); Sheriff Truman arrests Palmer's boyfriend [[Bobby Briggs]] ([[Dana Ashbrook]]), who is secretly seeing a married waitress named Shelly; Palmer's best friend [[Donna Hayward]] ([[Lara Flynn Boyle]]) and Palmer's secret boyfriend [[James Hurley (Twin Peaks)|James Hurley]] discover a mutual attraction; and Laura's mother is terrified by a vision.

The episode has two different endings, depending on which version of the episode one is watching. The American version ends with the above events, concluded by Sarah Palmer's nightmare of a hand digging into the ground and grabbing James's half of a necklace that belonged to Laura.

The international version was filmed with 20 extra minutes of footage in case the series was not picked up by the networks, rather allowing them to release it as a Television movie. It contains scenes from episode one, where Sarah realises that there was a man hiding in Laura's room when she checked in it the previous day. It also contains the ending to episode two, when Cooper dreams of meeting Laura and a mysterious man who speaks to him in a disjointed voice. It also reveals who Laura's killers were.

==Production==
===Conception and writing===
[[David Lynch]] and [[Mark Frost]] pitched the idea to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] during the time of the [[Writers Guild of America, East]] strike in 1988 in a ten-minute meeting with the network's drama head, Chad Hoffman, with nothing more than this image and a concept. According to the director, the mystery of who killed Laura Palmer was initially going to be in the foreground, but would recede gradually as viewers got to know the other townsfolk and the problems they were having. Lynch and Frost wanted to mix a police investigation with a soap opera.&lt;ref name="Northwest_Passage"&gt;{{cite video |people=Frost, Mark; Latt, David; Ray, Johanna; Lee, Sheryl; Wise, Ray; Robertson, Kimmy; Chen, Joan; MacLachlan, Kyle; Hersheberger, Gary; E. Coulson, Catherine; Horse, Michael; Dunham, Duwayne | date = 2007 | title = Northwest Passage: Development of the pilot | medium = DVD | publisher = CBS Home Entertainment }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ABC liked the idea, and asked Lynch and Frost to write a screenplay for the pilot episode. Frost wrote more verbal characters, like [[Benjamin Horne]], while Lynch was responsible for Agent [[Dale Cooper]]. According to the director, "He says a lot of the things I say".&lt;ref name="woodward"&gt;{{cite news

===Improvised elements===
[[File:David Lynch -microphone -10Aug2007-2p (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Lynch, the co-writer of the episode as seen in 2007]]
At several points during the filming of the pilot episode, [[David Lynch]] improvised by incorporating on-set accidents into the story. The most notable of these occurred when set decorator [[Frank Silva]] was being told to be careful to not get stuck in a room while furniture was being moved around. Lynch heard this and he says that the image of Silva being stuck intrigued him. Lynch then shot some footage of Silva perching behind Laura Palmer's bed, but was unsure as to what he would do with it. Silva was then accidentally filmed in a mirror during [[Sarah Palmer (Twin Peaks)|Sarah Palmer]]'s vision at the end of the pilot. The camera operator insisted that Lynch do another take because of the mistake, but he liked it so much he kept it in the show, and cast Silva as [[Killer BOB]], the mysterious tormentor of [[Laura Palmer]].&lt;ref name="Commentary"&gt;{{cite video |people=Dunham, Duwayne | date = 2002 | title = Audio commentary for the pilot episode | medium = DVD | publisher = Universal Home Entertainment }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the filming of the scene in which [[Dale Cooper]] first examines Laura's body, a malfunctioning [[fluorescent light]] above the table flickered constantly, but Lynch decided not to replace it, since he liked the disconcerting effect that it created. Also, during the take, one of the minor actors misheard a line and, thinking he was being asked his name, he told Cooper his real name instead of saying his line, briefly throwing everyone off balance. Lynch was reportedly pleased with the lifelike, unscripted moment in dialogue, and kept the mistake in the final cut.&lt;ref&gt;"Secrets from Another Place", a featurette in the ''Twin Peaks Definitive Gold Box Edition'' DVD release of October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Previews==
The pilot was first shown in September 1989 at the [[Telluride Film Festival]]. That same month, ''Connoisseur'' magazine ran a cover story calling Twin Peaks "the series that will change TV forever." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/05/arts/television-welcome-to-twin-peaks-and-valleys.html?pagewanted=all]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vulture.com/2017/05/twin-peaks-a-look-back-at-how-it-was-received.html]&lt;/ref&gt; After viewing the episode, [[Tom Shales]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' wrote "Twin Peaks isn’t just a visit to another town; it’s a visit to another planet. Maybe it will go down in history as a brief and brave experiment. But as can be said of few other TV shows in the near or immediate future: This You Gotta See."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1989/09/07/the-new-heights-of-twin-peaks/3f70b5d6-58a1-4c8a-ba94-70478b16fe98/]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 10, 1990, it was shown as part of the [[Miami International Film Festival|Miami Film Festival]]. [[Sun-Sentinel]] writer Robert Hurlburt wrote "the Lynchian sense of impending danger and kinky sexual undercurrents, coupled with excellent music, makes the ''Twin Peaks'' pilot work almost too well.  You'll want to see the entire package in one sitting.  But the series may lay an egg on television because of its drawn-out and deliberate pacing, brutality, sex with violence and a hint of something else ... something deadly, yet unseen and probably repulsive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Tv Pilot A Gory Soaper | publisher= [[South Florida Sun-Sentinel|Sun-Sentinel]] | url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1990-02-10/features/9001240040_1_blue-velvet-twin-peaks-mark-frost | date= February 10, 1990 | first= Roger | last= Hurlburt | accessdate= 2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ratings and awards===
The two-hour pilot was the highest-rated movie for the [[1989–90 United States network television schedule|1989–1990 season]] with a 21.7 rating and was viewed by 34.6 million people. In [[Los Angeles]], ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' became the seventh most-watched show of the week earning 29% of viewers, the most-watched show being ''[[Married... with Children]]'' which gathered 34% of viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/60033146.html?dids=60033146:60033146&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+10%2C+1990&amp;author=RICK+DU+BROW&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=%60Twin+Peaks'+Bow+Garners+Lofty+Ratings&amp;pqatl=google |title=''Twin Peaks'' Bow Garners Lofty Ratings |first=Rick|last=DuBrow|date=April 10, 1990 |accessdate=October 19, 2009 |publisher=''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following episode, "[[Traces to Nowhere]]" would start with a significant drop in ratings with only 23.2 million people tuning in. Various media such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and local radio stations announced that the show had managed to grow a cult following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/26/arts/a-soap-noir-inspires-a-cult-and-questions.html |title='A 'Soap Noir' Inspires a Cult and Questions |first=Jeremy|last=Gerard |date=April 26, 1990 |accessdate=October 19, 2009 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[42nd Primetime Emmy Awards]], the pilot episode was nominated six times, including "[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series#1990s|Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series]]" for [[David Lynch]], "[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series#1990s|Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series]]" for [[Kyle MacLachlan]] as [[Dale Cooper]], and "[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series#1990s|Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series]]" for [[Mark Frost]] and Lynch.

The pilot's [[Twin Peaks media releases#International pilot|international release]] tells the story of the series in a self-contained manner, and includes 20 minutes of additional footage.

===Critical reception===
Initially, the show's Thursday night time slot was not a good one for soap operas as both ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' and its short-lived spin-off ''[[The Colbys]]'' did poorly.&lt;ref name="roush" /&gt; ''Twin Peaks'' was also up against the hugely successful sitcom ''[[Cheers]]''. Initially, the show received a positive response from TV critics. [[Tom Shales]], in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', wrote, "''Twin Peaks'' disorients you in ways that small-screen productions seldom attempt. It's a pleasurable sensation, the floor dropping out and leaving one dangling."&lt;ref name="shale"&gt;{{cite news

Many critics saw the pilot as "the movie that will change TV" history, according to Diana White from the ''[[Boston Globe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&amp;p_theme=bg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EADDECD23B85990&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=It's Not Just a Series, It's a Lifestyle|first=Diana|last=White| date=April 10, 1990 |accessdate= October 19, 2009 |publisher=''[[Boston Globe]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ken Tucker from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' was strongly positive about the episode, giving it a A+. While liking the story, and calling Lynch's directing beautiful, he said "[there is] not a chance in hell" the show could become a ratings hit, because of its "unsettling" story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,317112,00.html |title=''Twin Peaks'' |first=Ken |last=Tucker |date=April 6, 1990 |accessdate= October 19, 2009 |publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Zurawik]] from ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' compared the pilot to the work of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. He also said its cinematography was "about as close as prime-time television gets to art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=e3oVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=z-sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5522,1616620&amp;dq=twin+peaks&amp;hl=en |title=ABC's new ''Twin Peaks'' series dares to be different |first=David |last=Zurawik|date=April 7, 1990 |accessdate= 2011-01-16 |work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]| publisher= [[The Register-Guard]] via news.google.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jen Chaney from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the pilot "one of the most finely crafted series kick-offs in broadcast history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/artsandliving/movies/features/bonus-points/103007.html |title=Taking Another Trip to ''Twin Peaks'' |first=Jen|last=Chaney|date=October 30, 2007 |accessdate=October 19, 2009 |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[TV Guide]] ranked the pilot #25 on its list of the 100 Greatest Episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=1997 |title=Special Collector's Issue: 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time |journal=[[TV Guide]] |volume= |issue=June 28-July 4 |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home video release===
Due to rights issues, the American pilot (94 minutes long) was not released in the United States [[VHS|home video market]] until 2007. The European pilot (116 minutes) had been released on VHS and [[laser disc]] years earlier: this alternate version of the pilot was aired in Europe as a stand-alone television movie. The European version is identical to the United States-aired version up until the last several scenes, when the killer of [[Laura Palmer]] is revealed. Both versions of the pilot are included in the ''Twin Peaks: Definitive Gold Box Edition'' DVD set, released in the US on October 30, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.movieweb.com/dvd/news/18/21718.php |title=''Twin Peaks: The Definitive Gold Box Edition'' Debuts on DVD October 30 |first= |last= |date=August 7, 2007 |accessdate=October 19, 2009 |publisher=''Movieweb'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184353/http://www.movieweb.com/dvd/news/18/21718.php |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch was so pleased with the footage shot for the European ending that he later incorporated some of it into Cooper's dream sequences that aired in subsequent episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=|title=Twin Piques Who Did It?

[[File:Sa-potpourri.jpg|thumb|A potpourri.]]
[[File: Draper-Pot Pourri.jpg|thumb|Painting of a woman making potpourri by [[Herbert James Draper]], 1897.]]

'''Potpourri''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|oʊ|p|ʊ|ˈ|r|iː}} is a mixture of dried, naturally fragrant [[plant]] material, used to provide a gentle natural scent, commonly in residential settings. It is often placed in a decorative bowl or tied in small [[Sachet (scented bag)|sachet]] made from sheer fabric.

The word "potpourri" comes into English from the [[French language|French]]  word ''pot-pourri''. The French term has two connotations. It is the French name for a [[Spain|Spanish]] stew with a wide variety of ingredients called "''[[olla podrida]]''", a specialty of the town of [[Burgos]]. The word was taken and copied by the French military during the Napoleonic occupation of Burgos (1808-1813). The word ''pot'' in French has the same meaning as it does in Spanish and English, while the word ''pourri''  means rotten. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/the-putrid-origin-of-potpourri&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File: Sèvres Porcelain Manufactory - Potpourri Vase (Vase potpourri à vaisseau) - Walters 48559.jpg|thumb|[[Sèvres pot-pourri vase in the shape of a ship]], 1763, porcelain.]] 
[[File:Potpourri.jpg|thumb|A potpourri vase.]]
Dried scented plant material has been used in rooms since ancient times, in a variety of ways, including just scattering them on floors. In early 17th Century [[France]], fresh [[herbs]] and flowers were gathered—beginning in spring and continuing throughout the summer. The herbs were left for a day or two to become limp, then layered with coarse [[sea salt]]. The aging mixture was stirred occasionally as layers were added to it. Often the mixture would [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|ferment]] or even mold as the summer went by. In fall, spices would be added to the unsightly grey mix until a pleasant fragrance was achieved. Then, scent preserving fixatives (see below) were added. The finished potpourri was set out in special pots with perforated lids to perfume rooms. 

Much modern potpourri consists of any decoratively shaped dried plant material (not necessarily from scented plants) with strong natural and synthetic [[perfume]]s (and often colored [[dye]]s) added, with the scent often bearing no relation to the plant material used. Sometimes, items that do not originate from plants are mixed in with the potpourri, to give it bulk and to make it more aesthetically pleasing. It is possible to spray scents onto potpourri, however, a fixative is needed so that the scent is absorbed for slow release. Generally, [[orris root]] is used for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/herbs/hgen/creating-potpourri-herb-garden.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifespan==
Dried flowers can last anywhere from two months to 20 years, depending on the chosen blend. Properly made potpourri will last longer when stored in closed container.

==Containers==
In ceramics manufacturing, a potpourri vase is a specifically designed for holding potpourri. In the traditional designs, a potpourri container is provided with a pierced fitted lid, through which the scent may slowly diffuse.  The porcelain [[Sèvres pot-pourri vase in the shape of a ship]] is one of the most spectacular examples from the 1750s and 1760s; [[Madame de Pompadour]] owned three of the twelve examples made, ten of which survived.

==Plants used==

[[File:Dried rose.jpg|thumb|A dried rose. Dried flowers are a common component of potpourris.]]
There are many plant species that are used for potpourri. Researchers have identified 300 species from 95 families, including [[fungi]] and [[lichen]]s. A few toxic ingredients have been found in fruits such as ''[[Strychnos nux-vomica]]'', the strychnine tree. Naturally scented plants used in traditional potpourri include:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rose.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Arthur-Tucker-Best-Plants-for-Homemade-Potpourri.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[cloves]]
* [[Cupressaceae|cypress]] wood shavings (toxic, another moth repellent)
* [[fennel]] seed
* [[incense-cedar]] wood shavings
* [[jasmine]] flowers and oil

* [[lavender]] leaves and flowers
* [[lemon balm]] leaves and flowers
* [[lemon]] peel
* [[marjoram]] leaves and flowers

* [[orange (fruit)|orange]] peel
* [[pelargonium]] leaves from the scented varieties
* [[pinyon pine]] shavings and cones 
* [[rose]] flowers, hips, or oil
* [[rosemary]] leaves and flowers

'''Qene''' also known as '''Säm əna Wärq''' is a unique style of [[poetry]] from [[Ethiopia]] that is rich and deep in meaning, which demands critical thinking and analysis of the poetry to understand its meaning. It demands having not only a strong [[Amharic]], [[Tigrigna]], or [[Ge'ez language|Ge’ez]] vocabulary, but also familiarity with the culture from where the particular poem originates or the background against which it was written.&lt;ref name="kweschn"&gt;Yigzaw, Mariye. [http://kweschn.com/2011/09/01/qene-or-sem-enna-werq-wax-and-gold/ "Qene or Sem enná Werq"], ''[[kweschn]]'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Yared.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Yared]]]]
It is believed that  [[Yared|Saint Yared]] is the originator of Qəne.&lt;ref&gt;Yigzaw, Mariye. [http://www.qeneonnet.org/aboutqene.php?contentid=6 "Origin &amp; Source of Qəne Subject Matter"], ''[[QeneOnNet]]'', Addis Ababa, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Since most of Saint Yared’s works are based on the Bible, thus it can be assumed that the Bible is the original source of Qəne composition. Some parts of the Bible such as the Psalms and the [[Song of Songs]] ([[Song of Songs|Song of Solomon]])  are written in poetry form. Some books of the Bible such as the Song of Songs and the teachings (sermons) of Jesus use a lot of metaphorical and allegorical language similar to the Säm əna Wärq mode of Qəne.  Saint Yared’s non-sparing use of the content and style of the Bible helped in making his compositions acceptable and popular. Some of his compositions are still used as prayers in their original form.

Although Saint Yared was the earliest composer of Qəne, he does not appear to have set the forms and meters for the genre. There are, in fact, several possible candidates deemed responsible. One possibility lies with Qəne scholars during the reign of  [[Eskender|Emperor Eskender]] (1478-1494) - Hawira, Menkera, Eskendera, Poeskenedera and Abidira. Another explanation – commonly referred to as the Wadla claim – attributes it to an early 15th-century scholar from Wadla named Yohannəs Geblawi. And then there is the Gonj claim - attributing the deed to a certain Täwanäy who flourished after the 15th century. Täwanäy is alleged to have learned his Qəne alongside Wäldä Mariam from a certain Eliab, who in turn learned it from alongside Lehib from Sämrä Ab, who in turn learned it from Yohannəs Geblawi.

Oral traditions also mention a certain Däqä Est’ifa as the scholar responsible for setting the meters for Qəne. Däqä Est’ifa is alleged to have acquired seven crafts from Greece - six having to do with magic, and the seventh Qəne - and returned to Ethiopia during the reign of [[Bä'edä Mariam|Emperor Bä'edä Mariam]] (1468-1478). He is then said to have taught the seventh craft to Prince Eskinder, Hawira, Menkera, Behur, and another Eskinder.

Däqä Est’ifa was quite popular at his former pupil Emperor Eskinder's court. One tradition claims he seduced the Emperor's wife and used one of his other crafts to vanish with her. Shortly thereafter, the Emperor set fire to the house Däqä Est’ifa and the Empress were hiding in. However, Däqä Est’ifa allegedly used another of his crafts to again disappear with his lover - and is said to still roam the island.

Yohannəs Geblawi, in contrast to Däqä Est’ifa's worldly crafts, is said to have acquired his Qəne during a spiritual meditation. Yohannəs was born at Geblon in Wadla (Lasta), and flourished at the time of [[Zara Yaqob|Emperor Zar'a Yacob]] (1434-1468). He and is said to have taught near Mount Tabor at Amara Saynt. Yohannes taught Qəne to the monk Aba Wäldä Gabriel, who in turn taught Sämrä  Kristos (Sämrä  Ab). Sämrä  Kristos (Sämrä  Ab) is said to have given [[Bä'edä Mariam|Emperor Bä'edä Mariam]] (1468-1478) Qəne lessons. He also taught Lehib and Eliab, the latter of whom taught Qəne to Täwanäy and Dədəq Wäldä Mariam.

Emperor Be'ede Mariam was so taken by the art of Qəne that he is said, on the advice of his teacher Sämrä  Kristos, to have gone into a week-long meditation to determine its origin. The answer was revealed to him on the festival of the changing of water unto wine (Qana ZeGelila), when he composed the following Qəne by divine inspiration,

        ድህረ ተሰብረ አጽንኦ ለሰብእናን ንሁክት
        ለብሃዊ ክርስቶስ በማየ ሃዲስ ጥምቀት፡፡

        After man's strength was shattered with grief,
        Christ the potter remade him with baptism.

As Be'ede Mariam's Qəne was composed during a gathering (Gubae) at the festival of [[Qana ZeGelila]], its form and meter has been known as Gubaʾe Qana. Sämrä  Kristos was then said to have composed a Zäʾämlakəye Qəne, after which the Emperor composed a Mibäzhu Qəne - the tradition claims.

One tradition also claims Täwanäy as Däqä Est’ifa's student. However, Däqä Est’ifa flourished during the reign of [[Eskender|Emperor Eskender]] - a period when third generation disciples of Yohannes Geblawi also taught. This casts into doubt the alleged role of Däqä Est’ifa as the originator of Qəne - as the line of Yohannes Geblawi would have precedence. Furthermore, the more than fifty years that span between Däqä Est’ifa and Täwanäy would make it hard to take the latter as a disciple. Moreover, other accounts put Täwanäy's time at the early 18th century.

Accordingly, along the Qəne line of Yohannes Geblawi, Sämrä Ab taught Lehib and Eliab. Eliab, in turn, taught Dədəq Wäldä Mariam and Täwanäy. Tradition also holds that due to unfavorable conditions caused by the wars of Ahmad Gragn (mid-16th century), Dədəq Wäldä Mariam and Täwanäy formed two separate Qəne styles - the Wadla and the Gonj schools, respectively.

Another interesting tradition holds that both disciples made the trip to Däq Island to further their knowledge. While Dədəq Wäldä Mariam chanced upon mystical teachers that helped him further his Qəne, Täwanäy had no such luck. Instead, he fell into the carnal snares of mystical women who thwarted his many attempts to escape. When he turned into an eagle and tried to fly away, they would turn into pebbles and stone him. When he turned into a worm to wiggle his way off the island, they would turn into chickens and peck at him. He finally managed to escape by turning into a flea and attaching himself to a sack of Gesho leaves destined for sale on the mainland! Perhaps the notion of Täwanäy as the disciple of Däqä Est’ifa stems from his legendary exploits at Däq  Island.

The same tradition claims that by the time Täwanäy escaped from Däq, he had only retained a fraction of what Eliab had taught him. Hence, the Gonj school of Qəne associated with Täwanäy stresses Qəne composition, but only fleetingly covers Ge'ez verb conjugation and syntax - whereas the Wadla school associated with Dədəq Wäldä Mariam teaches all these elements. The Wadla school was led by a succession of seven teachers - all with the title Dədəq - the last of whom was also named Dədəq Wäldä Mariam. He was succeeded by Ma'ibel Wäldä Hiwot (MeCha), who was then succeeded by Aleka Getahun (Gete Amoraw). The other disciple of Sämrä  Kristos, Lehib, taught Qəne to Zetre Wengel - who was succeeded by Zikri. He was in turn succeeded by Bekuru, and followed by Yonathan, who taught ZeNebiyat and QaleAwadi. Qale Awadi was succeeded by Aleka Maru of Amhara Sayint, who then taught Aqabe Se'at Kabte of Gonder.

Nevertheless, the multiplicity of Qəne lines of transmission does not imply multiple origins for Qəne. Saint Yared remains to be held as the founder of Qəne. Moreover, the many schools of Qəne can be seen in parallel to the various types of musical notations (such as Bethleheme, Qome, WenChere, AChabre, Wadle and Tegulete schools) that developed out of Saint Yared's Deggwa.

==Qəne and Poetry==

Traditionally any metrical verse with a rhyming scheme is defined as a poem, and since Qəne fulfills these requirements it can be considered to be a poem. However, while most poems have literal meaning, Qəne has to have a literal as well as a symbolic meaning by using the mode of Säm əna Wärq. One can say that all Qəne are poems, but not all poems can be Qəne. Qəne is different in that a profound idea can be veiled underneath an every-day idea through the mode of Säm əna Wärq (i.e. metaphorical representation). 
Since Qəne is sung as a hymn at a church service, one has to adhere to a standard metrical pattern.  The different types of Qəne have their own metrical pattern. The measure for the types of Qəne is not only numbers of verse but the syllabic metrical pattern as well. Thus, even though a poem uses a mode of Säm əna Wärq, unless it follows a certain metrical pattern it can’t be classified as a Qəne.

     እናንተ ወጣቶች ቀን አለ መስሏችሁ፣
     ከገጠሩ ኑሮ ከተማ ገብታችሁ፣
     መሠረት የሌላት ጎጆ መሥርታችሁ፣
     ዘማለች አደራ እንዳትወድቅባችሁ፡፡

     Oh! Youth thinking it is your time
     You left the countryside to settle in the city
     But your house is without foundation
     So be alert before the leaning house / harlot falls and/destroys you.

The poem has two Wärq phrases, the former is about the harlot and the latter warns about being destroyed by promiscuity. Even with such complex mode of Säm əna Wärq, the author called it a poem and not a Qəne. Thus we can see that Qəne has a much complex character than a poem.

==Qəne Language==
Most Qənes are composed in [[Ge'ez language|Ge’ez]], and most students at Qəne school start their education by learning the basics of the Gəʾəz language. Most Qənes are composed in Gəʾəz since Qəne rules regarding the Säm əna Wärq mode and metrical pattern are set up for the Gəʾəz language.&lt;ref name="kweschn" /&gt; But once we follow the right metrical pattern and rules of metaphor, one can compose Qəne in other languages. For Example in [[Amharic]], [[Oromo language|Afaan Oromo]], English …etc. This is evident in the advent of Guramayle Qəne (a blend of Gəʾəz and Amharic) and Amharic Qənes starting from the Gondarine Period (17th to 19th century)
Example of Qene blending Gəʾəz, Amharic and English:
3፡ Mäwädəs

     ኦ ብራዘርስ ውሉደ ጥምቀት፣
     እንተ በጉጓዔ ንትጋባ ውስተ ታዕካ ዘቅድስና፣
     መና ቃለወንጌል ቅዱስ እስመ በዛቲ አለና፣
     ፎር ዘ ሴክ ኦፍ ሳቲስፋይንግ ኢንተረስተ ውሉድ በጥዑም መና፣
     ወይነ ምስጋና ዘመላእከት ውስቴታ ተቀድሃ ከመ ከመ ያስተፍስህ የሰው ልቡና፣
     ኸርትሂ የገበሬ እርሻ እንዳያገኛት ሙስና፣
     ይዝነም ቃለ ወንጌል በፍቅር ወበትህተና፣
     እስመ ዝናመ ጽድቅ ተርዕየ በዘጳውሎስ ደመና፣
     ወደቂቀ ጳውሎስ አእዋም አህመልመሉ በዳኅና፡፡

     Oh Brothers, children of Baptism
     Let us hurry and enter the hall of Holiness
     Because inside there is Manna / words of the Gospel
     And to satisfy the interest of the children with tasty Manna
     The Angels’ gratitude / wine was poured to satisfy man’s conscience.
     And so that the farm/heart is not corrupted
     Let the words of the Gospel trickle with love and humility
     Because the rain of righteousness was seen in the clouds of Paul
     And the children of Paul / trees blossomed well. 
   
Meanings:
For the Säm, it is normal for people to rush towards a banquet hall where good food and drinks are being served. Comparatively, the BaläQəne(Qene Poet) advises his brothers (members of the MahəBärä Qədusan(MQ) organization) to rush towards the gates of the church where one can find food for the soul – words from the gospel and angelic voices of gratitude. In the second half, the BaläQəne recounts that without rain the farmer will lose all that he has planted. But observing the presence of rain clouds, the farmer will plant his seeds and when it rains all the plants will blossom. For the Wärq, the BaläQəne advises the MQ members to listen to the words of the gospel with love and humility. And the members are overjoyed because Patriarch Paulos, disregarding those advising him to close down the MQ association, allowed the association to continue doing its work.

==Types of Qəne==
Most Qənes are differentiated by their metrical pattern and length of verse.  There are also different types of Qəne which are differentiated by the particular usage of the Säm əna Wärq mode.  Since Qəne is sung as a hymn at a church service, classifying Qənes according to the metrical pattern is commonplace. Accordingly, there are 9 major Qəne types. And since some of them have sub-types, we can say that there are 17 types of Qəne.

The Qəne type is determined by the quantity and length of the verses. Thus there are some Qənes which have the same quantity of verses but are classified as different types of Qəne because of the variation in the length of the verses. A student starts his Qəne education starting from the shorter Qənes and working up to the lengthy Qənes. Each Qəne stage uses the previous stage as a building block. When a student is able to compose all the different types of Qəne, he is said to ''Bet Molla''. When someone presents the full variety of Qənes he is said to have composed ''Mulu Bet''.

===Gubaʾe Qana===

Gubaʾe Qana consists of two verses and symbolizes the divine and human nature of God.  There are four types of Gubaʾe Qana differentiated by length of the verse (Short Gubaʾe Qana and long Gubaʾe Qana) and Zema mode ( Gəʾəz Gubaʾe Qana and ʾəzl Gubaʾe Qana). Some say that Gubaʾe Qana got its name by being presented on Tərr 12 – the commemoration of Qana zägälila (wedding in Cana of Galilee). Others say that it got its name by being presented at an assembly in a place called Qana in Showa. Still others say that the name is given to signify the flavor (Qana) of Qəne. The fact that there are only two verses makes it ideal for beginner students and all Qəne students take their first steps in the world of Qəne with the two verse Gubaʾe Qana.

===Zäʾämlakəye===
Zäʾämlakəye consists of three verses and the zema mode is ʾəzl . The second verse is called Mändärdärya. According to some Qəne experts, the three verses symbolize the mystery of the Trinity. The name Zäʾämlakəye is derived from the fact that this type of Qəne is composed using the first line of Psalm 62 (“አምላኪየ አምላኪየ እገይስ ሀቤከ).

===Mibäzhu===
Just like Zäʾämlakəye, Mibäzhu has three verses. The zema mode is ʾəzl and symbolizes the Trinity. The name Mibäzhu is derived from the fact that this type of Qəne is composed using the first line of Psalm 3  (እግዚኦ ሚበዝኁ እለ ይሳቅዩኒ).

===Wazema===
There are two types of Wazema: Long Wazema (five verses with Araray zema mode) and Short Wazema(two verses). Some say Wazema is named as such because it is composed on the eve (wazema) of a major church holiday. Others say that the name is derived from a line in St. Yared’s chant “ዋይ ዜማ ሰማእኩ እመላእክት ቅዱሳን’’ . The long wazema is always composed on the eve of major church holidays.

===Səllase===
Səllase has six verses and the zema mode is ʾəzl . This Qəne genre symbolizes the 6 commands of the New Testament. The name is derived from the prayer of the 3 children thanking the god of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob ይትባረክ እግዚአብሔር አምላከ አበዊነ አምላከ አብርሃም አምላከ ይስሃቅ አምላከ ያዕቆብ.

===Zäyəʾəze===
Zäyəʾəze Qəne is usually presented in honor of a sovereign.  The name is derived from the Psalm where it says “ይዕዜ ትስእሮ ለገብርከ”. There are two types of Zäyəʾəze: long Zäyəʾəze (five verses with Gəʾəz zema mode) and Short Zäyəʾəze  (three verses with Araray zema mode). The Short Zäyəʾəze is also called sahləkä because it is usually presented with the psalm “ተሰሃለኒ እግዚኦ በከመ እበየ ሳህልከ”.

===Mäwädəs===
The word Mäwädəs is derived from the verb ወደሰ and denotes gratefulness. There are two types of Mäwädəs: fətah litä (eight verses with Araray zema mode) and kuləkəmu  (nine verses). Fətah litä is so named because it is performed after Psalm 42 (“ፍታህ ሊተ እግዚኦ ወተበቀል በቀልየ”), while kuləkəmu is performed after Psalm 46 (ኩልክሙ አህዛብ ጥፍሁ እደዊክሙ).

===kəbər yəʾəti===
This four verse Qəne is usually composed about the subject of the Holy Cross. According to the Zema mode, kəbər yəʾəti is classified into two: Gəʾəz kəbər yəʾəti and ʾəzl kəbər yəʾəti. The name kəbər yəʾəti is derived because it is performed after Psalm 149:9 (“ክብር ይእቲ ዛቲ ለከሉ ፃድቃኑ”).

===ʾət’anä mogär===
There are two types of ʾət’anä mogär: Gəʾəz ʾət’anä mogär (seven verses) and ʾəzl ʾət’anä mogär (eleven verses). The first 4 verses of Gəʾəz ʾət’anä mogär and the first 6 verses of ʾəzl ʾət’anä mogär usually recount about the day’s festivity. The last 3 verses of Gəʾəz ʾət’anä mogär and the last 5 verses of ʾəzl ʾət’anä mogär are called ʿäsärä nəgus. The ʿäsärä nəgus is composed in honor of a sovereign or to praise or rebuke a public figure.

==Traditions of Qəne==
There are some well known traditions of Qəne such as Nät’äqa, Gəlbät’a, and Tämäst’o. The mastery of these Qəne traditions is the sign of the BaläQəne’s expertise of the genre and his placement at the summit of the Qəne world.

===Nät’äqa===
As the meaning of the term attests, this tradition signifies the taking away of verses but does not equate with stealing. Nät’äqa  involves finishing off the verses of a Qəne as another person is reciting the beginning verses. This shows that the one who is doing the Nät’äqa already knows what the other composer was going to recite.
Example: Emahoy Gälanäsh’s Nät’äqa of her father’s Qəne

When the father was reciting
   “በታቦርሂ አመ ቀነጸ ምልኮትከ ፈረስ፣” - When your divinity / horse galloped

And the daughter finished the Qəne by saying,
   “ኢክሂሉ ስብሖቶሙ ሙሴ ወኤልያስ፡፡” - Moses and Elijah could not restrain it.

The amazed father then said,
   “በከመ ሰማእኩኪ አነ ኢይሰማእኪ ጳውሎስ!” - I hope St Paul does not hear what I have heard.

Meaning:  When a strong horse gallops it is hard for the rider to restrain it.

Hidden Meaning:  When Jesus took Peter and John with him to the top of Mount Tabor and showed them his transfiguration amongst Moses and Elijah, the disciples were overwhelmed and fell on the ground. The part about St Paul is referring to the Paul’s edict barring women from teaching in public.

===Gəlbät’a===

Gəlbät’a involves taking someone’s Qəne creating a new Qəne by changing the message and rhyming scheme. For example, it is common to wish newlyweds to have a marriage like Abraham and Sarah. But another person can use Gəlbät’a and overturn the blessing by saying let your marriage be not like Abraham and Sarah.  When asked why, one can say may the bride not be mentally anguished as Sarah was when Abraham had a child from Sarah’s Servant Hagar. On the other hand, a fearful Abraham gave away his wife to King Abemelek saying she was his sister – and this is a good reason to overturn the first blessing.

Thus, likewise, one can overturn the message of a Qəne being recited and create a whole new Qəne.  Such practice will help open up new viewpoints of things we are accustomed to and help us list the advantages and disadvantages of a particular knowledge system.

===Tämäst’o===
When composing Qəne, one is usually immersed in deep contemplation (Tämäst’o) and becomes oblivious to one’s surrounding. A well known example of such a deep contemplation is the story of the BaläQəne Kəflä Yohannəs who was active during the reign of Emperor Iyassu I (1674 – 1698).  It is said that Kəflä Yohannəs lived a very humble life and was not popular among the luxury-seeking clergy of the court who were constantly at work to put a rift between him and the emperor.   On one occasion, Kəflä Yohannəs,  deep in contemplation, did not salute   as the Emperor entered the Däbrä Bərhan Səllase Church with his entourage.  The clergy were quick to point out  Kəflä Yohannəs’ faux pas to the Emperor. Knowing that Kəflä Yohannəs meant no malice, the Emperor threw at him a gold nugget to rouse him from his meditation. Kəflä Yohannəs then approached the Emperor and composed the following  Qəne:

    በእስጢፋኖስ አእባን እመ የኀልቁ፣
    ዘበጠኒ ኢያሱ በወርቁ፡፡

    Since all the stones were used on (the martyr) Stephen
    Iyassu stoned me with gold.

The clergy were further disgraced when the Emperor rewarded Kəflä Yohannəs the gold nugget.  Kəflä Yohannəs donated the gold nugget to the church.

'''''Rent''''' is a [[rock musical]] with music, lyrics, and book by [[Jonathan Larson]],&lt;ref name="Rent: Bible"&gt;{{cite book | title=Rent| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson |author2=McDonnell, Evelyn |author3=Silberger, Katherine |year=1997| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; loosely based on [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s [[opera]] ''[[La bohème]]''. It tells the story of a group of impoverished young artists struggling to survive and create a life in [[New York City]]'s [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] in the thriving days of [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] [[Alphabet City, Manhattan|Alphabet City]]&lt;!-- The exact time in which the story takes place is never mentioned but is generally considered to be the early 1990s--&gt;, under the shadow of [[HIV/AIDS]].

The musical was first seen in a [[workshop production]] at [[New York Theatre Workshop]] in 1993. This same [[Off-Broadway]] theatre was also the musical's initial home following its official 1996 opening. The show's creator, [[Jonathan Larson]], died suddenly of an [[aortic dissection]], believed to have been caused by undiagnosed [[Marfan syndrome]], the night before the Off-Broadway premiere. The musical moved to Broadway's larger [[Nederlander Theatre]] on April 29, 1996.&lt;ref name="Rent: Glory"&gt;{{cite book | title=Rent | last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson |author2=McDonnell, Evelyn |author3=Silberger, Katherine |year=1997| pages=54–64| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Broadway, ''Rent'' gained critical acclaim and won several awards. The Broadway production closed on September 7, 2008, after a 12-year run of 5,123 performances. On February 14, 2016, the musical ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' surpassed ''Rent''{{'}}s number of performances with a 2pm matinee, pushing ''Rent'' from the [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|tenth- to eleventh-longest-running Broadway show]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/WICKED-Passes-RENT-to-Become-10th-Longest-Running-Show-on-Broadway-Today-20160214]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/celebritybuzz/article/75222-Long-Runs-on-Broadway]&lt;/ref&gt; The production grossed over $280 million.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;[[Time Magazine]], March 10, 2008 issue, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the show led to several national tours and numerous foreign productions. In 2005, it was adapted into a [[Rent (film)|motion picture]] featuring most of the original cast members.

==Concept and genesis==
In 1988, playwright [[Billy Aronson]] wanted to create "a musical based on [[Puccini]]'s ''[[La Bohème]]'', in which the luscious splendor of Puccini's world would be replaced with the coarseness and noise of modern New York."&lt;ref name="Aronson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billyaronson.com/musicals.php#rent |title=Musicals|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Jonathan Larson, a 29-year-old composer, began collaborating with Aronson on this project, and the two composed together "Santa Fe", "Splatter" (later re-worked into the song "Rent"), and "I Should Tell You". Larson suggested setting the play "amid poverty, homelessness, spunky gay life, [[Drag queen|drag queens]] and [[Punk subculture|punk]]" in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], which happened to be down the street from his [[Greenwich Village]] apartment. He also came up with the show's ultimate title (a decision that Aronson was unhappy with, at least until Larson pointed out that "rent" also means torn apart). In 1991, he asked Aronson if he could use Aronson's original concept and make ''Rent'' his own. Larson had ambitious expectations for ''Rent''; his ultimate dream was to write a rock opera "to bring musical theater to the [[MTV Generation|MTV generation]]".&lt;ref name="Odyssey"&gt;{{cite news | last=Tommasini| first=Anthony| title=The Seven-Year Odyssey That Led to ''Rent''| work=The New York Times| date=1996-03-17| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E1D91639F934A25750C0A960958260| pages=Section 2 Page 7 | nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aronson and Larson made an agreement that if the show went to Broadway, Aronson would share in the proceeds and be given credit for "original concept &amp; additional lyrics".&lt;ref name="Odyssey"/&gt;

Jonathan Larson focused on composing ''Rent'' in the early 1990s, waiting tables at the [[Moondance Diner]] to support himself. Over the course of years, Larson wrote hundreds of songs and made many drastic changes to the show, which in its final incarnation contained 42 songs. In the fall of 1992, Larson approached James Nicola, artistic director of New York Theatre Workshop, with a tape and copy of ''Rent''{{'}}s script. When ''Rent'' had its first staged reading at [[New York Theatre Workshop]] in March 1993, it became evident that, despite its very promising material and moving musical numbers, many structural problems needed to be addressed, including its cumbersome length and overly complex plot.&lt;ref name="Odyssey"/&gt;

As of 1994, the New York Theatre Workshop version of ''Rent'' featured songs that never made it to the final version, such as:

* "You're a Fool"
* "Do a Little Business", the predecessor of "You'll See", featuring Benny, Mark, Roger, Collins and Angel
* "Female to Female A &amp; B", featuring Maureen and Joanne
* "He's a Fool"
* "He Says"

This workshop version of ''Rent'' starred [[Anthony Rapp]] as Mark and [[Daphne Rubin-Vega]] as Mimi. Larson continued to work on ''Rent'', gradually reworking its flaws and staging more workshop productions.&lt;ref name="Memoir"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rapp, Anthony|title=Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent|year=2006|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |ISBN=0-7432-6976-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 1996, after the musical's final dress rehearsal before its off-Broadway opening, Larson had his first (and only) newspaper interview with music critic [[Anthony Tommasini]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', attracted by the coincidence that the show was debuting exactly 100 years after Puccini's opera. Larson would not live to see ''Rent''{{'}}s success; he died from an undiagnosed [[aortic aneurysm]] (believed to have resulted from [[Marfan syndrome]]) in the early morning of January 25, 1996. Friends and family gathered at the New York Theatre Workshop, and the first preview of ''Rent'' became a sing-through of the musical in Larson's memory.&lt;ref name="Odyssey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RentEW"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Rent star tells story of show’s first preview, after Jonathan Larson died| date=April 11, 2017| url=http://ew.com/theater/2017/04/11/rent-jonathan-larson-wilson-jermaine-heredia/| pages=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show premiered as planned and quickly gained popularity fueled by enthusiastic reviews and the recent death of its composer. It proved extremely successful during its Off-Broadway run, selling out all its shows at the 150-seat New York Theater Workshop.&lt;ref name="Rent: Glory"/&gt;  Due to such overwhelming popularity and a need for a larger theater, ''Rent'' moved to Broadway's recently remodeled Nederlander Theatre on 41st Street on April 29, 1996.&lt;ref name="Rent: Glory"/&gt;

==Sources and inspiration==
Larson's inspiration for ''Rent''{{'}}s content came from several different sources. Many of the characters and plot elements are drawn directly from Giacomo Puccini's opera ''La Bohème'', the world premiere of which was in 1896, a century before ''Rent''{{'}}s premiere.&lt;ref name="Rent: Leap of Faith"&gt;{{cite book | title=Rent ("Leap of Faith")| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson |author2=McDonnell, Evelyn |author3=Silberger, Katherine |year=1997| pages=18–37| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Bohème'' was also about the lives of poor young artists. [[Tuberculosis]], the plague of Puccini's opera, is replaced by HIV/AIDS in ''Rent''; 1800s Paris is replaced by New York's East Village in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The names and identities of ''Rent''{{'}}s characters also heavily reflect Puccini's original characters, though they are not all direct adaptations. For example, Joanne in ''Rent'' represents the character of Alcindoro in ''Bohème'', but is also partially based on Marcello. Also, Joanne is the only ''Rent'' character whose predecessor in ''La Bohème'' is the opposite sex.

Other examples of parallels between Larson's and Puccini's work include Larson's song "Light My Candle", which draws melodic content directly from "Che gelida manina";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nisbet|first=Ian|title=Transposition in Jonathan Larson's RENT|journal=Studies in Musical Theatre|date=2012|volume=5|issue=3|page=237|doi=10.1386/smt.5.3.225_1|url=http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-Article,id=12998/|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Quando me'n vo'|Quando me'n vo]]'" ("Musetta's Waltz"), a melody taken directly from Puccini's opera; and "Goodbye Love", a long, painful piece that reflects a confrontation and parting between characters in both Puccini's and Larson's work.&lt;ref name="Libretto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impresario.ch/libretto/libpucboh_e.htm|title=La Bohème&amp;nbsp;—Libretto in English|accessdate=|publisher=Kernkonzepte: Impresario|author=Puccini, Giacomo|authorlink=Giacomo Puccini}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Quando me'n vo'" is paralleled in the first verse of "[[Take Me or Leave Me]]", when Maureen describes the way people stare when she walks in the street. It is also directly referred to in the scene where the characters are celebrating their bohemian life. Mark says, "Roger will attempt to write a bittersweet, evocative song..."  Roger plays a quick piece, and Mark adds, "...that  ''doesn't'' remind us of 'Musetta's Waltz'." This part of "Musetta's Waltz" is also later used in "Your Eyes", a song Roger writes.

''Rent'' is also a somewhat autobiographical work, as Larson incorporated many elements of his life into his show. Larson lived in New York for many years as a starving artist with an uncertain future. He sacrificed a life of stability for his art, and shared many of the same hopes and fears as his characters. Like his characters he endured poor living conditions, and some of these conditions (e.g. illegal wood-burning stove, bathtub in the middle of his kitchen, broken buzzer [his guests had to call from the pay phone across the street and he would throw down the keys, as in "Rent"]) made their way into the play.&lt;ref name="Beals"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beals, Gregory|title=The World of ''Rent''|journal=Newsweek|date=1996-05-13|volume=CXXVII|issue=20|pages=58–59}} ([http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-literary-criticism/larson-jonathan/gregory-beals-essay-date-13-may-1996 Abstract])&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the motivation behind the storyline in which Maureen leaves Mark for a woman (Joanne) is based on the fact that Larson's own girlfriend left him for a woman.  The Mark Cohen character is based on Larson's friends, cinematographer and producer Jonathan Burkhart and documentary filmmaker Eddie Rosenstein.

Playwright [[Sarah Schulman]] alleged that ''Rent'' bore striking similarities to her novel ''People in Trouble''.&lt;ref name="Schulman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2131017|accessdate=2011-03-03|title=Sarah Schulman: the writer Rent ripped off|date=November 23, 2005|first=June|last=Thomas|publisher=Slate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line, "I'm more of a man than you'll ever be... and more of a woman than you'll ever get!", attributed to Angel Dumott Schunard at her funeral, was previously used by the character Hollywood Montrose, who appeared in the films ''[[Mannequin (1987 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1987) and ''[[Mannequin Two: On the Move]]'' (1991). Like Angel, Hollywood performs a song and dance number and sometimes wears women's clothing. This line was originally in the film ''[[Car Wash (film)|Car Wash]]'' (1976), delivered by [[Antonio Fargas]] as a flamboyant homosexual cross dresser.

The earliest concepts of the characters differ largely from the finished products. Everyone except Mark had AIDS, including Maureen and Joanne; Maureen was a serious, angry character who played off [[Oedipus]] in her performance piece instead of [[Hey Diddle Diddle]]; Mark was, at one point, a painter instead of a filmmaker; Roger was named Ralph and wrote musical plays; Angel was a [[jazz]] [[philosopher]], while Collins was a street performer; Angel and Collins were both originally described as Caucasian; and Benny had a somewhat enlarged role in the story, taking part in songs like "Real Estate", which was later cut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siteforrent.com/intro.html SiteforRent.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406222216/http://www.siteforrent.com/intro.html |date=2007-04-06 }} accessed April 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WSTM Team Dustizeff 0098.jpg|thumb|Life Café]]

Many actual locations and events are included in, or are the inspiration for, elements of the musical. Life Café, where the "La Vie Bohème" numbers are set, was an actual restaurant (closed 2013) on 10th Street and Avenue B in the East Village of New York City.&lt;ref name="Life Cafe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifecafenyc.com/ls_press.shtml |title=Making Rent; A Spell for Alphabet City|accessdate=2007-01-05|publisher=Life Cafe|year=1998|author=Ben Lerman |author2=Andrew Jacobs |work=Life Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rent: Connection"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rent ("Connection")|last=Larson|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Larson |author2=McDonnell, Evelyn |author3=Silberger, Katherine |year=1997|pages=138–141|publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The riot at the end of the first act is based on the East Village [[Tompkins Square Park riot (1988)|riot in 1988]] that arose as a result of the city-imposed curfew in [[Tompkins Square Park]].&lt;ref name="Rent: Connection" /&gt;

"Will I?", a song which takes place during a Life Support meeting and expresses the pain and fear of living a life with [[AIDS]], was inspired by a real event. Larson attended a meeting of [[Friends in deed|Friends in Deed]], an organization that helps people deal with illness and grief, much like Life Support. After that first time, Larson attended the meetings regularly. During one meeting, a man stood up and said that he was not afraid of dying. He did say, however, that there was one thing of which he was afraid: Would he lose his dignity? From this question stemmed the first line of this song. The people present at the Life Support meeting in the show, such as Gordon, Ali and Pam, carry the names of Larson's friends who died. In the Broadway show, the names of the characters in that particular scene (they introduce themselves) were changed nightly to honor the friends of the cast members who were living with or have died from AIDS.&lt;ref name="Rent: Friends In Deed"&gt;{{cite book | title=Rent ("Leap of Faith: Friends in Deed")| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson |author2=McDonnell, Evelyn |author3=Silberger, Katherine |year=1997| page=21| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene and song "Life Support" were also based on Friends in Deed, as well as on Gordon, Pam, and Ali. Originally, the members of Life Support had a solid block of the "forget regret" refrain, and they talked about remembering love. When Jonathan's HIV positive friends heard this scene, they told him that having AIDS was not so easy to accept: it made you angry and resentful too, and the song did not match that. Jonathan then added a part where Gordon says that he has a problem with this "credo...my T-cells are low, I regret that news, okay?" Paul, the leader of the meeting, replies, "Okay...but, Gordon, how do you feel today?" Gordon admits that he is feeling the best that he has felt all year. Paul asks, "Then why choose fear?" Gordon says, "I'm a New Yorker. Fear's my life."

===Lynn Thomson lawsuit===
Lynn Thomson was a [[dramaturge|dramaturg]] who was hired by New York Theatre Workshop to help rework ''Rent''. She claimed that between early May and the end of October 1995, she and Larson co-wrote a "new version" of the musical. She sued the Larson estate for US$ 40 million and sought 16% of the show's royalties, claiming she had written a significant portion of the lyrics and the libretto of the "new version" of ''Rent''.&lt;ref name="dramaturgy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openjurist.org/147/f3d/195/thomson-v-s-larson|title=147 f3d 195 Thomson v. S Larson|accessdate=2014-07-07|publisher=OpenJurist.com|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, Thomson could not recall the lyrics to the songs that she allegedly wrote, nor the structures of the libretto she claimed to have created.&lt;ref name = Playbill97&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/rent-dramaturg-suit-dismissed-com-71067|title =Rent Dramaturg Suit Dismissed|last = Lefkowitz|first = David|website = [[Playbill]]|date = July 23, 1997|accessdate = July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge ruled against her and gave the Jonathan Larson Estate full credit and right to ''Rent''. A federal appellate court upheld the original ruling on appeal. In August 1998, the case was settled out of court. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/10/theater/family-of-rent-creator-settles-suit-over-authorship.html|title = Family of 'Rent' Creator Settles Suit Over Authorship|last = McKinley|first = Jesse|date = September 10, 1998|website = [[The New York Times]]|accessdate = July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[Image:Rentt.JPG|thumb|250px|right|''Rent'' at David Nederlander Theatre in Manhattan, New York City]]

===Act I===
On Christmas Eve in Manhattan's East Village, two roommates—Mark, a filmmaker, and Roger, a rock musician—struggle to stay warm and produce their art ("Tune Up #1"). Mark's mother leaves him a voicemail wishing him a merry Christmas and trying to comfort him since his ex-girlfriend Maureen dumped him ("Voice Mail #1"). Their friend Tom Collins, a gay anarchist professor at New York University, calls and plans to surprise them at their apartment, but is mugged before entering. At the same time, Mark and Roger's former roommate and friend Benny, who has since become their harsh new landlord, has reneged on an earlier agreement and now demands last year's rent, before shutting down their electrical power ("Tune Up #2"). However, Mark and Roger rebel and resolve not to pay the rent they cannot pay and which they were promised wouldn't be a problem ("Rent"). Meanwhile, Angel, a [[cross-dressing]] street drummer (presently out of drag), finds Collins wounded in an alley and tends to him ("You Okay Honey?") - the two are immediately attracted to each other, both learning that the other is [[HIV positive]]. It is revealed that Roger too has HIV which he contracted from his last girlfriend, who committed [[suicide]] after learning of her diagnosis, which has caused Roger to fall into depression. Mark goes to see one of Maureen's shows while Roger stays home ("Tune Up #3"), trying to compose on his guitar without success; he wishes desperately to write one last song to be remembered by before he dies ("One Song Glory"). An exotic dancer, junkie, and neighbor, Mimi, shows up at their apartment asking for help with lighting her candle, flirting with Roger in the process; however, he is clearly hesitant to return her affections ("Light My Candle"). Meanwhile, Joanne, a lawyer and Maureen's girlfriend, receives a voicemail from her parents ("Voice Mail #2").

At last, the missing Collins enters the apartment, presenting Angel, who is now in [[drag queen|full drag]] and shares the money she made and the amusing story of how she killed a dog to earn it ("Today 4 U"). Benny arrives, speaking of Maureen's upcoming protest against his plans to evict the [[homeless]] from a lot where he is hoping to build a cyber arts studio. Benny offers that, if they convince Maureen to cancel the protest, then Mark and Roger can officially remain rent-free tenants. However, the two rebuff Benny's offer and he leaves ("You'll See"). Mark leaves to fix Maureen's sound equipment for the protest, unexpectedly meeting Joanne at the stage. Initially hesitant with each other, the two eventually bond over their shared distrust of Maureen's promiscuous behaviors ("Tango: Maureen"). Mark joins Collins and Angel to film their HIV support group meeting ("Life Support"), while Mimi attempts to seduce Roger alone in his apartment ("Out Tonight"). Roger is extremely upset by Mimi's intrusion, demanding she leave him alone and resisting any romantic feelings he may harbor for her ("Another Day"). After Mimi leaves, Roger reflects on his fear of dying an undignified death from AIDS, while the Life Support group echoes his thoughts ("Will I").

Collins, Mark, and Angel protect a homeless woman from police harassment, but she chastises them ("On the Street"). To lighten the mood, Collins talks about his dream of escaping New York City to open a restaurant in Santa Fe ("Santa Fe"). Soon, Mark leaves to check up on Roger and while alone, Collins and Angel confess their love for each other ("I'll Cover You"). Joanne hectically prepares for Maureen's show, trying to balance all of the people calling her at once ("We're Okay"). Before the performance, Roger apologizes to Mimi, inviting her to come to the protest and the dinner party his friends are having afterwards. At the same time, police, vendors, and homeless people prepare for the protest ("Christmas Bells"). Maureen begins her avant-garde, if not over the top, performance based on "[[Hey Diddle Diddle]]" ("Over the Moon"). At the post-show party at the Life Café, Benny arrives, criticizing the protest and the group's [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle. In response, Mark and all the café's bohemian patrons defiantly rise up to celebrate their way of living ("[[La Vie Bohème]]"). Mimi and Roger each discover that the other is HIV-positive and hesitantly decide to move forward with their relationship ("I Should Tell You"). Joanne explains that Mark and Roger's building has been padlocked and a riot has broken out; Roger and Mimi, unaware, share their first kiss. The celebration continues ("La Vie Bohème B").

===Act II===
[[Image:Cast of Rent performing "Seasons of Love" at Broadway on Broadway, 2005.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Cast of ''Rent'' performing "Seasons of Love" at ''Broadway on Broadway'', 2005]]

The cast lines up to sing together before the plot of the second act begins, affirming that one should measure life "in love" ("[[Seasons of Love]]"). Afterwards, Mark and Roger gather to break back into their locked apartment with their friends ("Happy New Year"). A new voicemail reveals that Mark's footage of the riot has earned him a job offering at a [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] news company called Buzzline ("Voice Mail #3"). The others finally break through the door just as Benny arrives, saying he wants to call a truce and revealing that Mimi, a former girlfriend of his, convinced him to change his mind. Mimi denies rekindling her relationship with Benny, but Roger is upset, and although they apologize to each other, Mimi goes to her drug dealer for a fix ("Happy New Year B").

Around Valentine's Day, Mark tells the audience that Roger and Mimi have been living together, but they are tentative with each other. It is also told that Maureen and Joanne are preparing another protest, and during rehearsal, Maureen criticizes Joanne's [[controlling behavior]] and Joanne criticizes Maureen's promiscuous mannerisms. They break up dramatically following an ultimatum ("[[Take Me or Leave Me]]"). Time progresses to spring ("Seasons of Love B"), but Roger and Mimi's relationship is strained by Mimi's escalating [[heroin]] usage and Roger's lasting jealousy and suspicion of Benny. Each alone, Roger and Mimi sing of love and loneliness, telling each other how they feel, as they watch Collins nurse Angel, whose health is declining due to AIDS ("Without You"). By the end of the summer, Mark continues to receive calls offering a corporate job at Buzzline ("Voice Mail #4"). A dance is performed representing all the couples' sex lives ("Contact"). At the climax of the number, the two former couples break up, and Angel suddenly dies. At the funeral, the friends briefly come together to share their memories with Collins being the last to reminisce ("I'll Cover You [Reprise]"). Mark expresses his fear of being the only one left surviving when the rest of his friends die of AIDS, and he finally accepts the corporate job offer ("Halloween"). Roger reveals that he is leaving for Santa Fe, which sparks an argument about commitment between him and Mimi, and between Maureen and Joanne. Collins arrives and admonishes the entire group for fighting on the day of Angel's funeral, causing Maureen and Joanne to reconcile, but not Mimi and Roger. The group shares a sad moment, knowing that between deaths and leaving, their close-knit friendships will be breaking up. Everyone leaves except Mark and Roger, and so Mark tries to convince Roger to stay in New York. Roger, unable to handle Mimi's declining health, becomes angry with Mark and leaves. Mimi returns to say goodbye, overhears everything Roger says, and, terrified, agrees to go to rehab ("Goodbye Love"). Collins is forcibly removed from the church for being unable to pay for Angel's funeral; Benny shows compassion by paying and offering Mark and Collins drinks; Collins accepts, causing him and Collins to rekindle their old friendship, but Mark has to turn down the offer due to work commitments.

Some time later, both Mark and Roger simultaneously reach an artistic [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], as Roger finds his song in Mimi and Mark finds his film in Angel's memory; Roger decides to return to New York in time for Christmas, while Mark quits his job to devote his efforts to working on his own film ("What You Own"). The characters' parents, concerned and confused about their respective situations, leave several worried messages on their phones ("Voice Mail #5"). On Christmas Eve, exactly one year having passed, Mark prepares to screen his now-completed film to his friends. Roger has written his song, but no one can find Mimi for him to play it to. Benny's wife, discovering Benny's relationship with Mimi, has pulled Benny out of the East Village. The power suddenly blows and Collins enters with handfuls of cash, revealing that he reprogrammed an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] at a grocery store to provide money to anybody with the code 'ANGEL'. Maureen and Joanne abruptly enter carrying Mimi, who had been homeless and is now weak and close to death. She begins to fade, telling Roger that she loves him ("Finale"). Roger tells her to hold on as he plays her the song he wrote for her, revealing the depth of his feelings for her ("Your Eyes"). Mimi appears to die, but abruptly awakens, claiming to have been heading into a [[near-death experience|white light]] before a vision of Angel appeared, telling her to go back and stay with Roger. The remaining friends gather together in a final moment of shared happiness and resolve to enjoy whatever time they have left with each other, affirming that there is "no day but today" ("[[Finale B]]").&lt;ref name="Rent: No Day but Today"&gt;{{cite book | title=Rent (''no day but today'')| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson |author2=McDonnell, Evelyn |author3=Silberger, Katherine |year=1997| pages=188–189| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles==

===Main characters===
&lt;!--NOTE: DO NOT ADD SINGING RANGES. This is original research--&gt;
* '''Mark Cohen''' (Lead): A struggling Jewish-American documentary filmmaker and the [[narrator]] of the show. He is Roger's roommate; at the start of the show, he was recently dumped by Maureen.
* '''Roger Davis''' (Lead): A once-successful-but-now-struggling musician and ex-lead singer and rock guitarist who is HIV-positive and an ex-junkie. He hopes to write one last meaningful song before he dies.  He is having a hard time coping with the fact that he, along with many others around him, knows that he is going to die. His girlfriend, April, killed herself after finding out that she was HIV-positive. He is roommates with Mark.
* '''Mimi Márquez''' (Lead): A Hispanic-American S&amp;M club dancer and drug addict. She lives downstairs from Mark and Roger, is Roger's love interest, and, like him, is HIV-positive. She is also Benny's ex-lover.
* '''Tom Collins''' (Support): An [[Anarchism|anarchist]] professor with AIDS. He is described by Mark as a "computer genius, teacher, and vagabond anarchist who ran naked through the [[Parthenon]]." Collins dreams of opening a restaurant in Santa Fe, where the problems in New York will not affect him and his friends. He was formerly a roommate of Roger, Mark, Benny, and Maureen, then just Roger and Mark, until he moves out.
* '''Angel Dumott Schunard''' (Support): A young drag queen who uses both she/her pronouns when in drag and he/him pronouns when out of drag. Angel is a  street percussionist with a generous disposition, who has AIDS; Collins' love interest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtishows.com/full-cast-info/1157&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''{{visible anchor|Maureen Johnson}}''' (Support): A [[performance art]]ist who is Mark's ex-girlfriend and Joanne's current girlfriend.

== Reception ==
''Rent'' received several awards including a [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]] and four [[Tony Award|Tony Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/theater-arts/cast-rent-article-1.2478997|title=Where the cast of "Rent" is now|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical reception of ''Rent'' was positive not only for its acting and musical components, but for its representation of HIV-positive individuals. Many critics praised the portrayal of characters such as Angel and Collins as being happy, with positive outlooks on life, rather than being resigned to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prezi.com/rkee5nh4_woa/no-day-but-today-the-critical-reception-of-rent/|title=No Day But Today: The Critical Reception of RENT|website=prezi.com|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; While critics and theatre patrons had largely positive reviews of the show, criticism was given to the show for the stereotypically negative portrayal of lesbian characters and the "glamourization" of the East Village in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121331730861070229|title=Among the 'Rentheads'|last=Hymowitz|first=Kay S.|date=2008-06-13|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billy Aronson said, "For the record, although I was ambivalent about Jonathan’s ideas for ''Rent'' when we were working together on it, I have come to love the show. And as tragic as it is that he didn’t live to see his work become a huge success, I believe he knew it would be. In our last conversation I asked how the show was going and he said, with complete assurance, that it was incredible."&lt;ref name="Aronson"/&gt;

==Cultural impact and legacy==
The song "Seasons of Love" became a successful pop song and often is performed on its own. Because of its connection to [[New Years]] and looking back at times past, it is sometimes performed at graduations or school holiday programs.

===RENT-heads===
''Rent'' gathered a following of fans who refer to themselves as "RENT-heads."  The name originally referred to people who would camp out at the Nederlander Theater for hours in advance for the discounted $20 rush tickets to each show, though it generally refers to anyone who is obsessed with the show.&lt;ref name="Time for 'Rent'"&gt;Adams, Bob.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20021024083952/http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/Village/1432/phillynews8.html "Time for 'Rent'",] ''The Philadelphia Gay News'', August 14, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  These discounted tickets were for seats in the first two rows of the theater reserved for sale by lottery two hours prior to each show.&lt;ref name="Time for 'Rent'"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reidel Party"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Riedel, Michael|title=Every Day a 'Rent' Party: hardcore fans of the hit musical form a squatters camp at the box office|date=1997-03-03|page=27|location=New York |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Broadway shows have followed ''Rent''{{'}}s example and now also offer cheaper tickets in efforts to make Broadway theater accessible to people who would otherwise be unable to afford the ticket prices.

The term originated in ''Rent''{{'}}s first months on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. The show's producers offered 34 seats in the front two rows of the orchestra for $20 each, two hours before the performance. Fans and others interested in tickets would camp out for hours in front of the [[Nederlander Theater]] – which is on 41st Street, just outside [[Times Square]] – to buy these tickets.&lt;ref name="Reidel Party"/&gt;

==Productions==

===New York workshops and off-Broadway production===
''Rent'' had its first staged reading at New York Theatre Workshop in March 1993.&lt;ref name="Odyssey"/&gt;  A further two-week [[New York Theatre Workshop]] version was performed in 1994 starring Anthony Rapp as Mark and Daphne Rubin-Vega as Mimi, and more workshops followed. The show opened on 1996, again at New York Theatre Workshop, and quickly gained popularity off-Broadway, receiving enthusiastic reviews.  ''The New York Times'' theater critic [[Ben Brantley]] called it an "exhilarating, landmark rock opera" with a "glittering, inventive score" that "shimmers with hope for the future of the American musical."&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E7DC1239F937A25751C0A960958260 "Rock Opera A la 'Boheme' And 'Hair'",] ''The New York Times'', February 14, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  Another reviewer wrote, "''Rent'' speaks to [[Generation X]] the way that the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' spoke to the [[baby boomers]] or those who grew up in the 1960s," while the ''New York Times'' similarly called it "a rock opera for our time, a ''Hair'' for the 90s."&lt;ref name="Comet"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Birth of a Theatrical Comet|journal=The New York Times|date=1996-03-17|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60B10F83D5D0C748DDDAA0894DE494D81|pages=Section 2 page 1|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show proved extremely successful off-Broadway, selling out all of its performances at the 150-seat theatre.&lt;ref name="Rent: Glory"/&gt;

===Original Broadway production===
Due to its overwhelming popularity and the need for a larger theater, ''Rent'' moved to Broadway's previously derelict Nederlander Theatre on 41st Street on April 29, 1996.&lt;ref name="Rent: Glory"/&gt;  On Broadway, the show achieved critical acclaim and word-of-mouth popularity. The production's ethnically diverse principal cast originally included [[Taye Diggs]], [[Wilson Jermaine Heredia]], [[Jesse L. Martin]], [[Idina Menzel]], [[Adam Pascal]], [[Anthony Rapp]], [[Daphne Rubin-Vega]] and [[Fredi Walker]].

The production's controversial topics and innovative pricing, including same day-of-performance $20 tickets, helped to increase the popularity of musical theater amongst the younger generation.&lt;ref name="Marks"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Marks, Peter| title=Looking on Broadway For Ramshackle Home| journal=The New York Times| date=February 26, 1996| page=C9| url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20616FD3A5D0C758EDDAB0894DE494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fN%2fNew%20York%20Theater%20Workshop| access-date=February 12, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529083704/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20616FD3A5D0C758EDDAB0894DE494D81&amp;n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FOrganizations%2FN%2FNew%20York%20Theater%20Workshop| archive-date=May 29, 2007| dead-url=yes| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The production was nominated for ten [[Tony Awards]] in 1996 and won four: Best Musical, Best Book, Best Original Score and Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical (Heredia)&lt;ref name="Tonys Search"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyawards.com/p/tonys_search?year=1996&amp;show=Rent|title=Past Winners Search|accessdate=November 30, 2006 |publisher=IBM Corp., Tony Award Productions|work=The Official Website of the American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 24, 2006, the original Broadway cast reunited for a one-night performance of the musical at the Nederlander Theatre. This performance raised over $2,000,000 for the [[Jonathan Larson Performing Arts Foundation]], [[Friends In Deed]] and New York Theatre Workshop. Former cast members were invited, and many from prior tours and former Broadway casts appeared, performing an alternate version of "Seasons of Love" as the finale of the performance.&lt;ref name="Playbill 10th"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/98789.html|title=''Rent''{{'}}s 10th Anniversary Celebration Will Reunite Past Bohemians, for Three Good Causes|publisher=Playbill, Inc.|date=2006-03-30|author=Jones, Kenneth|accessdate=November 30, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061224123746/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/98789.html|archivedate=December 24, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Original cast [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] members Rodney Hicks and Gwen Stewart returned to the cast at the time of the Broadway closing. Hicks played Benny and Stewart played the role she created, the soloist in the song "Seasons of Love". In addition, actress [[Tracie Thoms]] joined the cast at the end of the run playing Joanne, the role she portrayed in the 2005 film version.&lt;ref name="AP0907" /&gt;  The last Broadway performance was filmed and screened in movie theaters as ''Rent: Filmed Live on Broadway'' in September 2008. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray formats on February 3, 2009.

===North American touring productions===
Successful United States national tours, the "Angel Tour" and the "Benny Tour", launched in the 1990s. Later, the non-[[Actors' Equity|Equity]] tour started its run. There was also a Canadian tour (often referred to as the "Collins Tour").

The Angel tour began in November 1996 in Boston. Anthony Rapp joined the cast for the Chicago run, and Daphne Rubin-Vega joined for the Los Angeles run. The tour finished in San Francisco in September 1999. Other members of the Angel Cast included [[Carrie Hamilton]], [[Amy Spanger]], [[Luther Creek]], [[Kristoffer Cusick]], [[Tony Vincent]].

The Benny Tour began in July 1997 in San Diego, CA at the LaJolla Playhouse. Michael Grief, the original director of the Broadway show was also the artistic director of the LaJolla Playhouse and was instrumental in arranging for the Benny tour to begin in the smaller city of San Diego rather than Los Angeles, CA. It originally featured [[Neil Patrick Harris]] in the role of Mark Cohen. The Benny tour generally played shorter stops and often-smaller markets than the Angel Tour did. Other cast members included [[Wilson Cruz]] and [[d'Monroe]].

Tours ran each season from 2005 to 2008. Cast members throughout the run included [[Aaron Tveit]], [[Ava Gaudet]], [[Declan Bennett]], [[Rebecca Naomi Jones]], [[Constantine Maroulis]], [[Dan Rosenbaum]], [[Heinz Winckler]], [[Anwar Robinson]] and [[Karen Olivo]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} In 2009, a national tour starring Adam Pascal and Anthony Rapp, reprising their original Broadway roles, launched in Cleveland, OH.

I'd dub it 'Rent Reduced', in that the late Jonathan Larson's reworking of La Bohème, while never a great musical, has been turned into a grisly, synthetic, pseudo pop concert with no particular roots or identity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/theatre/drama/reviews/story/0,,2192137,00.html Rent | Theatre story|Guardian Unlimited Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;  The production closed on February 2, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/113661.html|title=New  London Production of Rent to Close in February 2008|work=Playbill|accessdate=23 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229072708/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/113661.html|archivedate=29 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production radically altered elements of the musical including defining the characters of Mimi, Angel and Mark as British. Songs were reordered (including Maureen's first appearance as the Act I finale).  The rehaul of the score was masterminded by [[Steve Anderson (musician)|Steve Anderson]] and featured radically rearranged versions of Out Tonight, Today 4 U, Over the Moon and Happy New Year.

A one-off Rent - The 20th Anniversary Concert was held at the Blackpool Opera house   Monday November 11, 2013 
A 20th anniversary tour opened at [[Theatr Clwyd]] in October 2016 before playing a two-month run at the [[St James Theatre, London]]. The cast included [[Layton Williams]] as Angel and [[Lucie Jones]] as Maureen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/20th-anniversary-production-of-rent_40884.html|title=New production of Rent to tour UK|work=WhatsOnStage.com|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production then continued to tour the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lewisloves.com/rent-musical-20th-anniversary-tour-malvern-theatre/|title=Reviewed by LewisLoves: Rent The Musical at the Malvern Theatre|date=2017-03-26|work=Lewis Loves|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 an immersive production of RENT premiered at [[Frogmore Paper Mill]] in Apsley, Hemel Hempstead.&lt;ref name=bw&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/westend/article/BWW-TV-First-Look-at-RENT-at-the-Worlds-Oldest-Papermill-20180710|title=First look at RENT at the World's Oldest Papermill|work=Broadway World|date=10 July 2018|accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cast included Aran Macrae (Roger), Connor Dyer (Mark) and Lizzie Emery (Mimi).

===Off-Broadway revival===
The show was revived [[Off-Broadway]] at Stage 1 of [[New World Stages]] with previews starting July 14, 2011 and a scheduled opening of August 11, 2011. This was the first New York Revival of the show since the original production closed less than three years earlier. The production was directed by ''Rent'''s original director [[Michael Greif]].  Almost the entire show was different from the original yet the reinvention did not please the critics, who complained that the new actors did not have a feel for the characters they were playing and it made the show feel contrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2011/08/12/theater/reviews/rent-revival-at-new-world-stages-review.html?scp=1&amp;sq=rent&amp;st=cse |work=The New York Times|first=Ben|last=Brantley|title=‘Rent' Revival at New World Stages – Review|date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Off-Broadway production of RENT closed on September 9, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/169812-Off-Broadways-Rent-Closes-Sept-9 |title=Off-Broadway's Rent Closes Sept. 9 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913000902/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/169812-Off-Broadways-Rent-Closes-Sept-9 |archivedate=2012-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
{{Main article|Rent (film)}}

In 2005, ''Rent'' was adapted into a movie directed by [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] with a screenplay by [[Stephen Chbosky]]. With the exception of Daphne Rubin-Vega (who was pregnant at the time of filming) and Fredi Walker (who felt she was too old for her role), who played Mimi and Joanne respectively in the original Broadway cast, the original Broadway cast members reprised the principal roles. Released on November 23, 2005, the film remained in the box office top ten for three weeks, receiving mixed reviews. Several plot elements were changed slightly, and some songs were changed to spoken dialogue or cut entirely for the film. The soundtrack was produced by [[Rob Cavallo]], engineered by Doug McKean and features renowned session musicians [[Jamie Muhoberac]], [[Tim Pierce]] and [[Dorian Crozier]].

[[File:Ruth Brown Snyder mugshot.jpg|thumb|Mugshot for her transfer to Sing Sing Prison in 1927]]
'''Ruth Brown Snyder''' (March 27, 1895 – January 12, 1928) was an American [[murderer]]. Her [[death penalty|execution]] in the [[electric chair]] at [[Sing Sing Prison]] for the murder of her husband, Albert, was recorded in a well-publicized photograph.

==Crime==
In 1925, Snyder was a housewife from [[Queens Village, Queens]], [[New York City]] who began an affair with Henry Judd Gray, a married [[corset]] salesman. She then began to plan the murder of her husband, enlisting the help of her new lover, though he appeared to be very reluctant. Her distaste for her husband apparently began when he insisted on hanging a picture of his late [[fiancée]], Jessie Guischard, on the wall of their first home, and named his boat after her. Guischard, whom Albert described to Ruth as "the finest woman I have ever met," had been dead for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:93NhH52erasJ:http://www.trivia-library.com/a/the-snyder-gray-murder-case-part-2.htm+Ruth+Brown+Snyder+was+born&amp;hl=en&amp;strip=1|title=Snyder/Gray case details|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth Snyder first persuaded her husband to purchase insurance, and, with the assistance of an insurance agent (who was subsequently fired and sent to prison for [[forgery]]) "signed" a $48,000 [[life insurance]] policy that paid extra ("[[double indemnity]]") if an unexpected act of violence killed the victim. According to Henry Judd Gray, Ruth had made at least seven attempts to kill her husband, all of which he survived.&lt;ref name=murder/&gt;&lt;ref name=story&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1928/01/13/page/2/article/ruths-brother-and-mother-object-to-prison-post-mortem|title=Story of the Crime|date=January 13, 1928|publisher=Chicago Tribune|page=2|accessdate=May 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 20, 1927, the couple [[garrotte]]d Albert Snyder and stuffed his nose full of [[chloroform]]-soaked rags, then staged his death as part of a burglary.&lt;ref name=story/&gt; Detectives at the scene noted that the burglar left little evidence of breaking into the house. Moreover, the behavior of Mrs. Snyder was inconsistent with her story of a terrorized wife witnessing her husband being killed.&lt;ref name=murder&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1935/12/29/page/65/article/snyder-murder-husband-victim-of-wife-and-her-weakling-paramour|title=Snyder Murder|author=Murchie, Guy, Jr.|date=December 29, 1935|pages=9–10|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=May 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police then found the property that Ruth claimed had been stolen. It was still in the house, but hidden. A breakthrough came when a detective found a paper with the letters "J.G." on it (it was a memento Albert Snyder had kept from former lover Jessie Guischard), and asked Ruth about it. A flustered Ruth's mind immediately turned to her lover, whose initials were also "J.G.," and she asked the detective what Gray had to do with this. It was the first time Gray had been mentioned, and the police were instantly suspicious. Gray was found upstate, in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. He claimed he had been there all night, but eventually it turned out a friend of his had created an alibi, setting up Gray's room at a hotel. Gray proved far more forthcoming than Ruth about his actions. He was caught and returned to [[Jamaica, New York|Jamaica, Queens]] and charged along with Ruth Snyder.&lt;ref name=murder/&gt;&lt;ref name=story/&gt; [[Dorothy Parker]] told Oscar Levant, an American in Paris, that Gray tried to escape the police by taking a taxi from [[Long Island]] to Manhattan, New York, which Levant noted was "quite a long trip." According to Parker, in order "not to attract attention, he gave the driver a ten-cent tip."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levant|first=Oscar|title=The Memoirs of an Amnesiac|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|year=1965|location=New York|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The trial===
Snyder was imprisoned at [[Sing Sing]] in [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining, New York]], about 30 miles north of New York City. Her prison cell there would in the future also be used to hold Eva Coo and "Lonely Hearts killer" [[Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck|Martha Beck]].{{citation needed|date = March 2018}}

The trial at the [[Long Island City]] Courthouse was covered by such figures as [[Peggy Hopkins Joyce]], [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]], [[Aimee Semple McPherson]], [[D. W.

===Execution===
On January 12, 1928, Snyder became the first woman to be executed in Sing Sing since 1899. She went to the electric chair only moments before her former lover.&lt;ref name=murder/&gt;&lt;ref name=story/&gt; Her execution (by [[New York State Electrician]] [[Robert G. Elliott]]) was caught on film, by a photograph of her as the electricity was running through her body, with the aid of a miniature plate camera custom-strapped to the ankle of [[Tom Howard (photographer)|Tom Howard]], a ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' photographer working in cooperation with the ''Tribune''-owned ''[[New York Daily News]]''.&lt;ref name="siedu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historywired.si.edu/object.cfm?ID=472|title=HistoryWired: A Few of Our Favorite Things|website=National Museum of American History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard's camera was owned for a while by inventor [[Miller Reese Hutchison]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Owner of camera that took death cell pictures a recent visitor here|url=http://bplonline.cdmhost.com/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/p4017coll2&amp;CISOPTR=171&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=4|work=Clipping from [[The Birmingham News]]|publisher=[[Birmingham Public Library]]|date=February 9, 1938|accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later became part of the collections of the [[Smithsonian|Smithsonian's]] [[National Museum of American History]].&lt;ref name="siedu"/&gt;

Snyder was interred in the [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in The [[The Bronx|Bronx]], New York City.  Her gravestone simply reads "Brown".&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lorraine Snyder==
Albert and Ruth had one child, a daughter named Lorraine, who was nine at the time of her father's murder. Following the pronouncement of the death sentence on her mother in May 1927, legal disputes arose between the relatives of both Albert and Ruth Snyder regarding the care of Lorraine. Warren Schneider, &lt;!-- no explanation of why variation of brothers' surname spelling --&gt;brother of Albert Snyder, petitioned to be allowed to appoint a legal guardian who was not a member of Ruth Snyder's family. Josephine Brown, mother of Ruth Snyder, also petitioned for custody of the girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=To Seek Guardian for Lorraine Snyder|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Kq0gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fGkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=lorraine+snyder&amp;pg=4608,3431254|accessdate=4 July 2017|work=The Lewiston Daily Sun|date=May 12, 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorraine had been in the care of Mrs. Brown since the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruth Snyder's Family|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=supPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3lQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=josephine+brown&amp;pg=2323,5380779|accessdate=4 July 2017|work=The Evening Independent|date=January 10, 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorraine was formally placed by her maternal grandmother in the Catholic institution where she had been residing at the time of her mother's execution.

By May 1928, the insurance company made available $4,000 for the maintenance of Lorraine.

==Depiction in popular media==
* The drama ''[[Machinal]]'' (1928), by playwright Sophie Treadwell, is based on Snyder's trial.
* The movies ''[[Blessed Event]]'' (1932) and ''[[Picture Snatcher]]'' (1933) make references to Snyder's execution. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}
* A fictionalized version of the trial was the basis of scenes in ''[[State's Attorney (film)|State's Attorney]]'' (1932) with John Barrymore as the prosecutor.
* The case was the inspiration for the novel ''[[Double Indemnity (novel)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1943) by [[James M. Cain]],&lt;ref name="trutv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/cops_others/robert_elliott/6.html?print=yes|title=truTV Official Website - TV Show Full Episodes and Funny Video Clips|website=www.trutv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later [[Double Indemnity (film)|adapted for the screen]] (1944) by [[Billy Wilder]] and [[Raymond Chandler]].
* Cain also mentioned that his book ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (novel)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (1934) took inspiration from the crime &lt;ref name="The Art of Fiction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3474/the-art-of-fiction-no-69-james-m-cain|title=James M. Cain, The Art of Fiction No. 69|first=Interviewed by David|last=Zinsser|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Near the end of the 1951 film ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'', a reporter, Scotty, mentions that Snyder's execution was the first he ever covered. When another character asks Scotty if he was able to get a picture, Scotty answers, "No, they didn't allow cameras, but one guy . . . ." The approach of "The Thing" interrupts him, but Scotty is seemingly referring to Howard's photo of Snyder in the electric chair.
* In ''[[The Bad Seed]]'', [[William March]] based his depiction of Bessie Denker's execution upon that of Ruth Snyder.
* [[Guns N' Roses]]' 1991 ''[[Use Your Illusion]]'' albums feature, as part of their enclosed artwork, a photo of the band posing in front of an oversized reproduction of the ''Daily News''' headline/photograph announcing Ruth Snyder's execution.
* The novel ''A Wild Surge of Guilty Passion'' (2011), by [[Ron Hansen (novelist)|Ron Hansen]], is based on the murder case. &lt;!-- isbn neeeded --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

'''Sheaffer Pen Corporation''' (ʃeɪfɜː) is a manufacturer of [[writing instrument]]s, particularly luxury [[fountain pen]]s. The company was founded by [[Walter A. Sheaffer]] in [[Fort Madison, Iowa]], and incorporated in 1913 &lt;ref&gt;State of Iowa, Secretary of State April 21, 1913 Book I-5 page 380&lt;/ref&gt; to exploit his invention of a lever-filling fountain pen. The brand was sold by  [[France|French]] parent company [[Société Bic|Bic]] to [[A. T. Cross Company]] in August, 2014.

==History==
In 1912, Walter A. Sheaffer took his idea of a pen-filling apparatus that utilized a lever system and, with his life savings, founded the W.A. Sheaffer Pen Company in Fort Madison, Iowa.  The company was established in the backroom of Mr. Sheaffer's jewelry store with seven employees, and was incorporated a year later, in 1913.  By the 1930s, Sheaffer fountain pens were being advertised as the pen that "fills instantly from any ink-well, with one touch of a finger.  Cleans automatically when filling."

Sheaffer has manufactured fountain pens down to the present day. The original lever-filler mechanism remained in use through the end of the 1940s, though a sacless plunger design was introduced in the early 1930s.

In 1949 Sheaffer adopted the "Touchdown" pneumatic-filling mechanism for its top-line fountain pens. A development of the Touchdown design was the Snorkel, which added a small extendable tube underneath the nib to avoid the need to dip the nib into ink when operating the filler plunger.  The last Snorkel pen was the oversize "Pen For Men (PFM)," a fat-bodied model introduced in 1959 with the then-new "Inlaid Nib" which has since featured on all Sheaffer's high-end pens.

All Sheaffer pens after 1959 (excluding the PFM) were designed to accept either ink cartridges or a converter to allow the use of bottled ink.  The Targa was a popular high-end model which was introduced in 1976 and came in over 80 different finishes and two sizes (classic and slim). The still very popular Connoisseur was introduced in 1986 as an upgraded version of the low cost No-Nonsense line that paid homage to earlier Sheaffer flat-tops, and included the high end Grande series, and three series of Levenger Connoisseur's that were dual branded and sold by Levenger. Another popular Sheaffer fountain pen was the low-cost "School Pen".  Current high-end pens in the range include the Valor and the Legacy series, all of which retain the inlaid nib.

On July 31, 1997, Société Bic S.A., known for its Bic pens and lighters, agreed to buy Sheaffer for less than $50 million.  Bic, of France, bought Sheaffer from Gefinor S.A., a Geneva-based investment bank, according to Thierry Michels, communications director at Bic.  Michels said Bic paid less than the $50 million that Sheaffer had achieved in current annual sales.  At the time of the Bic purchase, Sheaffer had 550 employees, 450 of whom were based in North America.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 2003, corporate officials announced their intention of closing Sheaffer's Fort Madison, Iowa, plant after nearly a century of making pens in the southeastern Iowa city. At its peak, the company employed more than 1,000 people in [[Fort Madison, Iowa|Fort Madison]].  The shutdown of the factory was completed by the end of March 2008, affecting about 40 workers. Sheaffer's fountain pen point assembly department was moved to a third-party manufacturer in China.  Customer service, purchasing, information technology, warehousing and distribution operations, packaging, and quality control were relocated to Slovakia.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Bought by [[Société Bic|BIC]] in 1997, Sheaffer was sold in August 2014 to the [[A. T. Cross Company]] for $15 million (US).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.challenges.fr/entreprise/20140821.CHA6856/bic-dit-adieu-aux-stylos-sheaffer.html Bic dit adieu aux stylos Sheaffer], ''Challenges'', 21 août 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
Sheaffer currently manufactures thirteen models of luxury writing instruments, including: Taranis, Legacy Heritage, Prelude, Prelude Mini, Sagaris, Intensity, 500, 300, 200, 100, Stylus, Sentinel, and VFM.&lt;ref&gt;http://sheaffer.com/en/writing-instruments&lt;/ref&gt; As well as writing instruments, Sheaffer also manufactures leather pen pouches and tablet holders, two calligraphy sets, three types of pencil erasers, ballpoint and rollerball refills, stylus refills, Sheaffer converters, eight colors of Skrip bottled ink, Sheaffer Skrip cartridges, and Skrip universal cartridges.&lt;ref&gt;http://sheaffer.com/images/warranty/Sheaffer_Refill_Guide2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sheaffer.com/en/leather&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Sheaffer launched the [[Ferrari]] collection luxury writing instruments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9323">Indigenous Mexican art celebrates the skeleton and uses it as a regular motif.  The use of skulls and skeletons in art originated before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Conquest]]: The [[Aztecs]] excelled in stone sculptures and created striking carvings of their Gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2008/may/02/skullartisnotanewidea|title=Skull art is not a new idea|first=Jonathan|last=Jones|date=2 May 2008|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coatlicue]], the Goddess of earth and death, was portrayed with a necklace of human hearts, hands and a skull pendant. She was imbued with the drama and grandeur necessary to dazzle the subject people and to convey the image of an implacable state. The worship of death involved worship of life, while the skull – symbol of death – was a promise to resurrection. The Aztecs carved skulls in monoliths of lava, and made masks of [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] and jade. Furthermore, the skull motif was used in decoration. They were molded on pots, traced on scrolls, woven into garments, and formalized into hieroglyphs.

==Spanish invasion==
When the Spanish invaded and conquered [[Tenochtitlan]] in the sixteenth century, they imposed the  [[Catholic]] religion and Spanish folk-practices of the era. This included the pagan tradition of celebrating the dead with food-offerings and feasts. However, the Spanish priests were eager to discontinue these ancient traditions that found fertile ground in Mexico. The Spanish suppressed the Mexican skull art tradition because it was too ''Indito'' or pagan for their refined European tastes. Not until Mexico won its independence from Spain in 1821, did skull art begin to re-emerge as a symbol of ''Mexicanidad''.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Reign of Porfirio Díaz==
When [[Porfirio Díaz]] became president, he was burdened with a bankrupt economy. To help the economic situation in Mexico, Díaz encouraged foreign investments. Investors were pleased with Mexico's cheap labor force. The Mexican–Indian laborer worked under cruel conditions. [[José Guadalupe Posada]], Mexican engraver, with his drawing criticized the conditions in Mexico.
Jose Guadalupe Posada is probably the most important Mexican artist of our times. During his lifetime, Posada was a witness to the crucial social and political changes which shaped Mexico into a modern nation. Changes such as the downfall of a dictator, a wide – spread social revolution, and the struggle for a power combined with the birth of a democratic process, all these experiences deeply influenced him. Through his work, he documented these occurrences and became a pictorial historian.

==José Guadalupe Posada==
[[File:Posada1.Quijote.jpeg|thumb|Posada's Skull art was a chilling message]]
Posada's drawings brought an awakening to the common man. He made those who could not read to understand what was happening in their country. Although the use of skulls and skeletons in art had been suppressed by foreign influences, it was still recognized among the poor in their celebrations of the Day of the Dead.
Using skull art was Posada's way to make a connection with the popular audience. Reproduced on box lids is his most famous engraving – [[la Calavera Catrina]] – which shows a fashionable lady in the guise of a skeleton. [[Diego Rivera]] called José Guadalupe Posada the greatest Mexican people's artist. From this influence, Rivera painted common people living and working in their environment. His work also carried a social message.
Posada and Rivera deeply influenced the Jaliscano [[Jorge González Camarena]], who disregarded the traditional methods and embraced the popular art of Posada and Rivera. Recurring battle scenes appear in González Camarena's work where Revolutionary soldiers become part of the ancient Mexican history as their lifeless bodies change into skeletons.[[File:Gran calavera eléctrica2.jpg|thumb|José Guadalupe Posada's version of Skull art used as a political message to those who did not know how to read.]]

==Frida Kahlo==
[[Frida Kahlo]] was also the product of a bold and brilliant generation that looked back with devotion to its Mexican roots and valued the reality it found there, uncontaminated by foreign influence. She admitted having a great deal of admiration for her husband's work, as well as that of Jose Guadalupe Posada and she found great beauty in the highly developed pre-Conquest indigenous art.

==Surrealists==
Frida was claimed early on by [[André Breton]] and the Surrealists as one of their own, and for a time she did not mind to be caught up and identified with the chic vanguard movement. But, later she declared herself not one of them because she said "I painted dreams, I painted my own reality." In the 1940s she painted "The Dream," where a conscious skeleton floats above the sleeping Frida. The Mexican brujos say "to live is to sleep and to die is to awaken." For Frida, perhaps, death like dreams exists in parallel.
[[File:The Kid - Diego Rivera.jpg|thumb|[[Diego Rivera]]'s Skull art expression]]

==Chucho Reyes==
While Frida's work focused on ''Mexicanidad'', Chucho Reyes integrated European fine art styles with the essence of the popular Mexican skull art. Perhaps his art was politically unpopular for those who chose to disregard foreign influences. However, Reye's unconventional combination was most likely influenced by his eccentric father who, although devoutly Catholic, practiced [[brujeria]]. He slept in a bed where [[rooster]]s were tied to each bedpost and a large eye was painted above his bed on the ceiling. This mixture of European religious beliefs with Mexican witchcraft was what most likely inspired Reyes to combine different artistic styles. Art like this will take quite a while to master

==Superstitions and saints==
Although modernly the ancient Aztec religious traditions that have remained are called brujeria by those who practice European religions, in [[Oaxaca]] – superstitions and saints are spoken in the same breath.

==Rufino Tamayo &amp; the Oaxacan School==
[[Rufino Tamayo]] founded the Oaxacan school of painting on the principle that although painting must take place on the plastic level, it does not exclude the possibility that the work contain a profound consequence not altogether expressed. Tamayo seemed to strip away man's external self, found for instance in religion, in order to examine man's fundamental fears. His fear of nature, of the cosmos, and above everything else, man's fear of himself. The subtle and rich art of pre-Columbian times greatly inspired Tamayo. From this influence he painted man as a transparent flesh existing on a living skeleton.

==Francisco Toledo==
On the other hand, [[Francisco Toledo]] painted his subjects as if they were x-rays. Salacious curiosity with the inner being becomes almost pornographic as his erotic and irreverent resurgence of Skull Art comes forward.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image: La Muerte Agachada.jpg|thumb|Francisco Toledo's La Muerte Agachada (Falling over with laughter)]] --&gt;

==Rodolfo Nieto==
While Rufino Tamayo founded the Oaxacan School, it was [[Rodolfo Nieto]][http://www.RodolfoNieto.com] who defined it. Rodolfo added a dramatic tone to skull art. Using light colors fixed against dark hues, he showed the continual battle of life and death. With gaiety, humor, whimsies, and boyhood stories of [[Tarzan]] the Ape Man fighting the perils of the jungle, Rodolfo laughed at death while living in the shadows of his own deepening depression.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Flashes of light confused by color, juxtaposed against the stark black canvasses, he did not attempt to define human existence, but just to live it, knowing that the skull was always within him.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  His painter wife Nancy Nieto removed the fleshy mask of life in order to examine the basis of life, the skull and skeleton..... &lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image: Calavera de Monzo.jpg|thumb|Rodolfo Nieto's "Calavera de Monzo" preception of Skull Art, a way he laughed at his own approaching death]] --&gt;

==Chicano / Mexican – American==
Often Chicano or Mexican American artists turn to their history, recently and notably Nancy Nieto brings a bold resurgence to the ancient tradition of Mexican skull art.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:La Musica.jpg|thumb|Nancy Nieto's La Musica]]--&gt; Woven into a veil of rich colors and unconventional forms, adopted from the Oaxacan School, her work removes the veil of mystery the mystery of life only to reveal the mystery of death. She shows depths of mystery yet has a harmonious eurhythmic note of the epic origins of the chromatic [[Oaxaca]]. She struggles to re-address Francisco Toledo's erotic themes, and to step away from Rodolfo Nieto's dramatic tomes. Her work renews the Aztec view of death as a transitional cycle between the individual life and the ubiquitous "to be".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3228">'''The Society for the Arts, Religion, and Contemporary Culture''', or '''ARC''', was founded in October 1961 by three people, Alfred Barr, the art critic and founder of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the theologian [[Paul Tillich]], and Marvin Halverson an American Protestant theologian sometime of the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]] and the author of a 1951 booklet, ''Great Religious Paintings''.&lt;ref&gt;Halverson M., [http://lccn.loc.gov/54004313 ''Great Religious Paintings''], New York, H. N. Abrams, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its aims and program are based on the deep and complex relationship between religion and the arts.  Its first board of directors included these three as well as [[Unitarian Universalist]] theologian and parish minister, [[James Luther Adams]]; mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], principal developer of the merger forming the [[United Church of Christ]], [[Truman B. Douglass]]; Congregationalist parish minister and theologian [[Amos Wilder]], and [[Stanley Romaine Hopper]], theologian and co-founder of the first Theology and Literature program in the United States.

Among the more than 300 Fellows of the Society have been [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Denise Levertov]], [[Sallie McFague]], [[Cleanth Brooks]], [[Marianne Moore]], [[W. H. Auden]], and [[John Updike]].

During the late 1960s most of the individuals involved in the published discourse pertaining to the field of [[theopoetics]] were either fellows or members of SARCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keefe-Perry|first=L. B. C.|title=Christianity and Literature|journal=Christianity and Literature|year=2009|volume=58|issue=4|url=http://theopoetics.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Theopoetics-Process-and-Perspective1.pdf|accessdate=11/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another major focus of the Society has been the role of myth in culture resulting in two publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell (ed.)|first=Joseph|title=Myth, Dreams and Religion|year=1970|publisher=E. P. Dutton &amp; CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently SARCC sponsors public lectures and currently publishes a newsletter, Seedbed. Previously it has published a periodical entitled "ARC Directions."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4447">This article provides a list of [[fiction]]al stories in which [[Spiritualism]] features as an important [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] element.  The list omits passing mentions.

==Written works==
{{inc-lit}}
*[[William Dean Howells]], ''[[The Undiscovered Country (novel)|The Undiscovered Country]]'', an 1880 novel on [[Spiritualism]] and its dangers for the mental stability of its fanatical adherents.
*[[Henry James]], ''[[The Bostonians]]'' (1886), whose heroine is viewed as  having fallen under the spell of female trance lecturers such as Mrs. Ada T.P. Foat, modeled on the real-life [[Cora L. V. Scott]]. The novel illustrates how Spiritualism was adopted by persons involved in late-19th-century [[reform movement]]s. 
*[[Bolesław Prus]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)#Inspirations|Pharaoh]]'', an 1895 [[historical novel]] incorporating scenes inspired by [[Spiritualism]].
*[[H.G. Wells]], ''[[Love and Mr Lewisham|Love and Mr. Lewisham]]'', a novel published in 1900, in which the main character falls in love with a girl whose stepfather claims to be a spirit [[medium (spirituality)|medium]]. A large portion of the novel deals with the questionable ethics of some practitioners of the occult. (This novel marked one of the earliest departures from science fiction for Wells—and was a best-seller.) 
*[[Hamlin Garland]], ''[[Tyranny of the Dark (novel)|Tyranny of the Dark]]'', a 1905 novel  which follows the budding romance between a skeptical man of science and a beautiful young spirit [[medium (spirituality)|medium]]. (Much of the novel's material was based on the author's actual investigations.)
*[[Arthur Conan Doyle]], ''[[The Land of Mist]]'', a novel published in 1926. The third of Doyle's [[Professor Challenger]] stories, ''The Land of Mist'' deals with the conversion to Spiritualism of Challenger's friend Edward Malone, his daughter Enid, and finally Challenger himself. Doyle was a committed Spiritualist, and this book's presentation of Spiritualist ideals is somewhat more earnest than that in most books of its type, while the descriptions of [[séance]] phenomena are substantially more pedantic.
*[[George S. Kaufman]], [[Moss Hart]], ''[[You Can't Take It with You (play)|You Can't Take It with You]]'', a play which premiered on Broadway in 1936, where one of the characters, Mrs. Kirby, believes in [[Spiritualism]].
*[[A. S. Byatt]], [[Possession (Byatt novel)|''Possession: A Romance'']]. In the Victorian half of this 1990 novel, many preoccupations of the time are discussed and experienced by the characters. Spiritualism is treated as a fraud on the credulous.
*[[Sarah Waters]], ''[[Affinity (novel)|Affinity]]'' (1999): This [[historical novel]] is about a depressed young woman in turn-of-the-century England. She is depressed because she had been having a [[lesbian]] affair with a friend, who decided to cut off their relations and marry a man.  In an effort to lift her [[Depression (mood)|depression]], she volunteers at a women's [[prison]], where she meets a beautiful young [[Spiritualist]], Selena Dawes, to whom she feels romantically attracted.  The protagonist learns about [[Spiritualism]] as she falls deeper in love with Selena.
*[[Michelle Black]], "Sèance in Sepia" (2011): In this [[mystery novel]], real-life spiritualist [[Victoria Woodhull]] investigates the world of [[spirit photography]] and ends up solving a murder mystery in 1875 [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, Michelle, Sèance in Sepia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27743">'''Stage combat''' or '''fight choreography''' is a specialised technique in [[theatre]] designed to create the [[illusion]] of physical [[combat]] without causing harm to the performers. It is employed in live [[stage plays]] as well as [[operatic]] and [[ballet]] productions. With the advent of cinema and television the term has widened to also include the [[choreography]] of [[film]]ed fighting sequences, as opposed to the earlier live performances on stage. It is closely related to the practice of [[stunts]] and is a common field of study for [[actor]]s. Actors famous for their stage fighting skills frequently have backgrounds in [[dance]] or [[martial art]]s training.

==History==
===Ancient history===
The history of stage fighting and mock combat can be traced to antiquity, with [[Aristotle]] quoted as noting that tragedy is conflict between people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Poetics|last=Aristotle|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Chpt. 6, Sect. II. Line 16-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or indeed it may be traced to the [[origins of the human species]] and [[primate]] [[display behaviour]]. Display of martial aptitude is a natural occurrence in [[warrior|warrior societies]], and ritualized forms of mock combat often evolve into [[war dance]]s. Whether it is the struggle between the men and women of [[Aristophanes]]' [[Lysistrata]] in Ancient Greece or Ancient Egypt where [[Herodotus]] in his [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] talks about a religious festival in which they beat each other with staves but no one dies, staged combat has always existed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Histories|last=Herodotus|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Book II|location=|pages=Line 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As it doesn't make sense to sacrifice citizens in rituals, many ancient civilizations turned to symbolic gestures of combat through dancing or bringing a weapon to someone's throat or neck without actually touching them to symbolize death or an act of violence.

===Post-classical history===
Fights staged for entertainment may also be in earnest for the combatants, as was the case with the Roman [[gladiator]]s, and any public [[duel]], such as the [[judicial duel]] of the [[European Middle Ages]]. The [[medieval tournament]] and [[jousting|joust]] are a classical examples of competitive ritualised mock combat. The joust from the time of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] developed into a [[sport]] with enormous cost involved for each knight and correspondingly high prestige attached, comparable to contemporary [[Formula One]] races, while at the same time minimizing the danger of injury with highly specialized equipment.

In the [[Late Middle Ages]], staged fencing bouts, with or without choreography, became popular with [[fencing schools]]. Some German [[fechtbuch]] ("combat manuals", literally 'fight' or 'fence book') have sections dedicated to flamboyant techniques to be employed in such ''Klopffechten'' ("knockabout fighting"), which would be impractical in serious combat, and the Late Medieval German masters distinguish mock fights (''fechten zu schimpf'', 'rant fighting') and real combat (''fechten zu ernst'', 'earnest fighting').

The history of European theatrical combat has its roots in [[medieval theatre]], and becomes tangible in [[Elizabethan drama]]. [[Richard Tarlton|Richard Tarleton]], who was a member of both William [[Shakespeare]]'s acting company and of the London Masters of Defence weapons guild, was among the first fight directors in the modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stage Fights|last=Gordon|first=Gilbert|publisher=Theatre Art Books|year=1973|isbn=0-87830-131-3|location=New York|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sword duels depicted in plays showed how popular the pastime was in actual life. Before 1615 in England, many plays featured duels and the duels were regarded as highlights of the show. As opposed to after 1615, when dueling was publicly condemned by [[James VI and I|King James]] and the duels were used as a last resort in regards to the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waggoner|first=G. R.|date=1965|title=Timon of Athens and the Jacobean Duel|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2867659|journal=Shakespeare Quarterly|volume=16|pages=304-306|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern History===
During the late 17th and early 18th centuries, stylized stage combat has been a staple feature of traditional performing arts for centuries, such as in Japanese ''[[Kabuki]]'' theater (as ''tachimawari'' "fighting scenes"), Chinese [[Beijing Opera]] and Indian theater.

[[fencing (sport)|Fencing]] masters in Europe began to research and experiment with [[historical fencing]] techniques, with weapons such as the [[two-handed sword]], [[rapier]] and [[smallsword]], and to instruct actors in their use. Notable amongst these were George Dubois, a Parisian fight director and martial artist who created performance fencing styles based on [[gladiator]]ial combat as well as Renaissance [[rapier and dagger]] fencing. [[Egerton Castle]] and Captain [[Alfred Hutton]] of London were also involved both in reviving antique fencing systems and in teaching these styles to actors.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Tony.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, scenes of swordplay in touring theatrical productions throughout Europe, the British Commonwealth and the USA were typically created by combining several widely known, generic routines known as "standard combats", identified by names such as the "Round Eights" and the "Glasgow Tens".

[[Cinematic fencing]] has its roots in the 1920s, with the movies of [[Douglas Fairbanks]]. One of the more celebrated fight directors who emerged in this time was [[Paddy Crean]] who revolutionized stage combat, specifically sword play, for the silver screen and theater. Paddy created the flamboyant style of sword play that can be seen in [[Errol Flynn filmography|Errol Flynn movies]], among others. He promoted the use of safety above all things and then focused on story of the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Feryn|first=Elisabeth|title=The Fight Master: A Documentary about Paddy Crean|date=2008-03-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mW6P8bZADk&amp;t=330s|volume=|pages=|access-date=2018-11-17|last2=Walker-Fitzpatrick|first2=Lesley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[B. H. Barry]] and J. Allen Suddeth, students of Paddy Crean, are two fight masters who have continued developing Paddy's legacy.

Informal guilds of fight choreographers began to take shape in the 1970s with the establishment of The Society of British Fight Directors, 1969 to 1996. Training was established in the United States with the formation of the [https://www.safd.org/ Society of American Fight Directors] in 1977.

Following this, further academies and associations worldwide have been established to uphold the craft, training and quality of work in the art-form of stage combat nationally and internationally, including: The [[British Academy Of Stage &amp; Screen Combat (BASSC)]] and [http://www.fdc.ca/ Fight Directors Canada (FDC)] in 1993; the [https://safdi.org.au/ Society of Australian Fight Directors Inc. (SAFDi)] in 1994; the [http://nordicstagefight.com/ Nordic Stage Fight Society (NSFS)] and the New Zealand Stage Combat Society in 1995; the British Academy of Dramatic Combat (BADC) in 1996; [http://www.artofcombat.org/ Art of Combat] in 1997; [http://www.stage-combat.de/ Stage Combat Deutschland] in 2004; and the [https://www.australianstagecombat.org.au/ Australian Stage Combat Association (ASCA)] in 2010; [http://thebritishguildofstagecombat.blogspot.com/ The British Guild of Stage Combat] in 2015. As of 2005, [[East 15 Acting School]], [[London]] offered a [[B.A. (Hons)]] Degree in ''Acting &amp; Stage Combat.'' Many of the societies offer certification programs for different weapons, which is used as an indicator about how much training an actor has had.

==Techniques==
[[File:Sword parts no scabbard.PNG|alt=Diagram of a sword and it's parts.|thumb|The parts of a sword.]]
Stage combat training includes unarmed combat skills such as illusory slaps, punches, kicks, throwing and holding techniques;  theatrical adaptations of various forms of [[historical fencing|fencing]] such as [[rapier]] and [[dagger]], [[smallsword]] and [[broadsword]], as well as the use of other weapons, notably the [[quarterstaff]] and [[knives]]; and more specialized skills such as [[professional wrestling]] and different styles of [[martial arts]]. However, stage combat can include any form of choreographed violence and the options are limited only by safety concerns, and the ability of the participants involved. As a note, most of these techniques are drawn from actual fighting techniques, but modified to be safer for actors. For example, although there are a number of ways of creating the safe illusion of a slap to the face (which is obviously something that could really be done in combat), none of these involve making actual contact with the victim's face.

The over-riding concern is for the safety of the actors and audience. This requirement has led to the adaptation of many standard martial arts and fencing skills specifically for performance. For example, many basic sword attacks and parries must be modified to ensure that the actors do not bring the points of their weapons past their partner's face or otherwise inadvertently risk the other actor's health and well-being. Attacking actions in stage combat are extended past the performance partner's body, or aimed short of their apparent targets. Likewise, whereas their characters may be trying to violently twist each other's limbs, slap, or punch, or grapple, and engaging in vicious unarmed combat, the actors must operate at a high level of complicity and communication to ensure a safe, exciting fight scene. In many forms of stage combat, distance is a key factor in technique. Many attacks are performed 'out of distance' so that there is no possible chance of one performer accidentally striking the other. Considerable professional judgement is called upon to determine what technical level may be appropriate for a given performer, taking into account allotted rehearsal time, and the expectations of the director.

Another important element of stage combat is sound. Sound increases the believability of an action for the audience. There are two kinds of sounds that can be made. One is vocal reactions. By adding a gasp, groan, or grunt when struck, the combatants make the moves come to life. The other kind of sound is a knap or a percussive sound made by hitting a resonant part of the body.&lt;ref&gt;The Society of American Fight Directors. ''Glossary of Terms''. Updated 3/19/16. http://www.safd.org.&lt;/ref&gt; This is timed to the moment an impact would happen and is staged so it is hidden from the audience. This allows the audience to believe that an actual blow or slap has landed because they hear a corresponding sound and see a reaction. 

The combat phase of a play [[rehearsal]] is referred to as a ''fight rehearsal''. Choreography is typically learned step by step, and practiced at first very slowly before increasing to a speed that is both dramatically convincing and safe for the performers and their audience. Even stage combat is risky, and it is preferable for actors to have as much [[training]] and [[experience]] as possible. A "fight call" or a brief rehearsal before the show is performed each time, set aside for the actors to "mark" through the fight to increase their [[muscle memory]]. A show which involves fight choreography will typically be trained and supervised by a professional fight choreographer and may also include a ''fight captain'', who runs fight calls and ensures that actors are remaining safe throughout the duration of the show. 

The fighting styles in movies set in the Medieval or Renaissance period may be unrealistic and historically inaccurate. Most fight choreographers use a mix between Asian martial arts and sports fencing to re-enact fight scenes. This generally due to the look of the fighting asked for by the director. If the director wants the story to flow a certain way, then the fight director will choreograph the fights to fit that style and tell the story.

== Types of weapons used in stage combat ==
For stage combat, all edges should be dulled and points blunted so that there is no risk of severe injury if someone is accidentally stabbed. In addition, weapons that are used, and not just for show, should be certified as combat-ready, thereby preventing any accidents involving blades accidentally breaking off.
[[File:Quarterstaff line drawing - Project Gutenberg eText 14315.jpg|thumb|Quarterstaff fight]]

=== Quarterstaff ===
Used in shows that are performed in large playing spaces due to the large size of the weapon. Most popular [[quarterstaff]] fight is that between Robin Hood and Little John in the tale of [[Robin Hood]] from the 17th century ballad. Modern quarterstaff choreography has also integrated the techniques of the [[Bō|bō staff]] from the Japanese martial art [[Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū]] which originated around 1447. Examples of this style can be seen in the famous [[Kabuki]] play ''[[Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura]]'' written in 1748.

=== Broadsword ===
[[File:Rapier MET sfeah29.16.10 004.jpg|thumb|200x200px|Rapier sword.]]
A large sword commonly used in the early [[Middle Ages]] in Europe. The [[broadsword]] was notable for its large hilt which allowed it to be wielded with both hands due to its size and weight. Used for slashing rather than stabbing, this weapon is used in plays set in this period like Shakespeare's ''[[Macbeth]]'' and is also seen in fantasy epics like ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]''.

=== Rapier ===
First school instructing on the correct use of the [[rapier]] in England was started in 1576 by Rocco Bonetti from Italy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Weapons in the theatre|last=Wise|first=Arthur|publisher=Barnes and Noble|year=1968|isbn=|location=New York|pages=5, 123-124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonetti took over the lease from playwright [[John Lyly]] to open his school in [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Methods and Practice of Elizabethan Swordplay|last=Turner|first=Craig|last2=Soper|first2=Tony|publisher=Southern University Press|year=1990|isbn=|location=Carbondale, IL|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rapier has the advantage of the thrust over the slash which means it could be a much smaller and lighter weapon than the broadsword. It is popular in Shakespeare plays like ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Hamlet]]'' where duels are performed and can be used in combination with a dagger.
[[File:The art of fencing, or, the use of the small sword Fleuron T123392-15.png|thumb|Two men dueling using the smallsword.]]

=== Smallsword ===
The [[Small sword|smallsword]] came into fashion in England and France in the late seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was used as a thrusting weapon and so sword movements were kept minimal to find the opening that a thrust could land. Most men of the period carried smallswords as fashion accessories so most were elegantly ornamented. An example of a smallsword duel can be seen in ''[[Les Liaisons Dangereuses (Hampton play)|Les Liaisons Dangereuses]]'' by [[Christopher Hampton]] written in 1985, based on the 1782 [[Les Liaisons dangereuses|novel of the same name]].
[[File:Knife fighting practice. Training session led by Dmitry Dyomushkin – Photo 002.jpg|thumb|Two opponents face off in a knife fighting rehearsal.]]

=== Knife ===
There are many styles of knives from the [[Bowie knife]] to a [[switchblade]]. [[Knife fight|Knife fights]] tend to have quick sharp movements. A example of this can be seen in ''[[West Side Story]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s fight between Riff and Bernardo. Often in plays however, it is one actor with a knife against someone who is unarmed like in Act I of [[Georges Bizet]]'s opera ''[[Carmen]],'' written in 1875.

[[File:Arbo-Valkyrien 1864.jpg|thumb|Approximate size and shape of shield used in stage combat.]]

=== Sword and shield ===
The [[Shield|shields]] used in stage combat are commonly round and are strong enough that they can be used as a defensive and offensive weapon. An important element in using a shield is to hold the shield arm in an upper diagonal so the fist is higher than the elbow so the top of the shield does not move when struck, and the danger being hit in the face with the shield or the weapon using to strike it can be avoided. Sword and shields can be found in battle scenes like in Shakespeare's [[Wars of the Roses]] history plays.

=== Unarmed ===
This consists of hand to hand combat without weapon. Elements of unarmed combat include slaps, punches, kicks, grabs, chokes, falls, rolls, grappling, among others. Many fight directors rely on combinations of messy street fighting and martial arts such as [[aikido]] and [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] to create fights of this nature. Generally more common in modern contemporary plays, after swords have gone out of style but also seen in older plays such as Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' when Othello strangles Desdemona.

=== Found Objects ===
Found objects are objects that are not traditionally weapons but can be used so in the context of the scene. A classic example of this is breaking a bottle over someone's head. As with all stage combat, the objects are rigged so as not to actually pose any danger to the recipients. In the case of bottles or plates, [[sugar glass]] molds are used rather than actual glass bottles.
[[File:Katana moderne.JPG|thumb|Example of a katana.]]

=== Japanese weapons ===
Other weapons like a [[katana]], a Japanese style sword that is curved on one side, and [[Nunchaku|nunchuks]] can also be used onstage. These require more detailed study of Japanese martial arts. Stage combat versions of nunchuks can be purchased that are foam instead of wood, thereby reducing the danger to the actors.
[[File:Battle-axe (PSF).png|thumb|Example of a battle axe.]]

=== Melee weapons ===
[[Melee weapon|Melee weapons]] are used in large battle scenes and can include [[Spear|spears]], [[Axe|axes]], [[Mace (bludgeon)|maces]], [[Flail (weapon)|flails]], and more. These are other weapons that are best used in large playing spaces where there is room to work at a safe distance.

==Realism in fight choreography==
Fight choreography can vary widely from true [[Realism (arts)|realism]] to outright [[fantasy]] depending upon the requirements of a particular production. One of the biggest reasons that theatrical fight directors often do not aim for strict realism is that the live audience could not easily follow the 'story' of the action if bodies and blades were moving in the ways trained fighters would move them. For example, a production of [[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)]], by [[Edmond Rostand]], using 17th-Century rapiers, might show Cyrano making lots of circular cut attacks. But a more efficient, practical attack would be taking a quicker, more direct line to the opponent's body. But the fight director knows that the audience couldn't follow the action as well if the attacks were faster (the audience might hardly be able to see the thin blades whip through the air), so most fight choreographers would make choices to help the audience follow the story. Of course, this is dependent on the production, the director and other stylistic choices.

One school of fight choreographer thought says that an unusual aspect of live stage combat, such as in a play, is that audiences will react negatively to even simulated violence if they fear the actors are being harmed: for example, if an actor is really slapped in the face, the audience will stop thinking about the character and, instead, worry about the performer. Audiences may also fear for their own safety if large combat scenes seem to be out of control. Therefore, stage combat is not simply a safety technique but is also important for an audience to maintain uninterrupted [[suspension of disbelief]].

==Types of choreographed fights==

===In theater===
Having its roots in [[Medieval theatre]], stage combat enters classical theatre choreography with [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan drama]] ([[Shakespeare]]'s simple and oft seen stage direction, ''they fight'').

===On film===
{{main|Combat in film}}
[[File:The three musketeers fairbanks.jpg|thumb|Movie poster for [[The Three Musketeers (1921 film)|''The Three Musketeers'']] (1921) starring Douglas Fairbanks.]]

Cinema inherited the concept of choreographed fights directly from the theatrical fight. [[Douglas Fairbanks]] in 1920 was the first film director to ask a fencing master to assist the production of a fencing scene in cinema.&lt;ref&gt;2007 Britannica, s.v. fencing.&lt;/ref&gt; A second wave of swashbuckling films was triggered with [[Errol Flynn]] from 1935. Renewed interest in swashbuckling films arose in the 1970s, in  the wake of
''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' (1973). Directors at this stage aimed for a certain amount of historical accuracy, although, as the 2007 [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] puts it, "movie fencing remains a poor representation of actual fencing technique".
The ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, the fights for which are choreographed by [[Bob Anderson (fencer)|Bob Anderson]] &amp; Peter Diamond (Episodes IV, V &amp; VI) and Nick Gillard (Episodes I, II &amp; III), tend to portray its [[lightsaber combat]] using swordsmanship techniques drawn from existing martial arts, but performed with fantasy weapons such as [[lightsaber]]s or [[the Force]], whereas the action featured in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' also choreographed by Bob Anderson employed fantasy weapons and fighting styles, designed by [[Wolf System stage combat training|Tony Wolf]].

During the 1970s and 1980s, [[Sonny Chiba]], [[Bruce Lee]] and [[Jackie Chan]], who are famous for both choreographing and acting in martial arts action films, were influential in the development of stage combat on film. [[Hong Kong]]-based fight choreographer [[Yuen Woo-ping]] is known for his work on ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' and [[The Matrix series|the ''Matrix'' trilogy]], in which the often unrealistic fighting techniques are complemented by directorial techniques such as [[bullet time]]. [[Ching Siu-tung]] is particularly noted in the field of [[Hong Kong action cinema]] for his use of graceful [[wire fu]] techniques. By contrast, films such as ''[[The Duellists]]'', fight directed by William Hobbs, ''[[Once Were Warriors (film)|Once Were Warriors]]'', fight directed by Robert Bruce and ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'' &amp;  [[Ironclad (film)|Ironclad]], fight directed by Richard Ryan are widely famed for including gritty, realistic combat scenes. Ryan is also known for his creativity in devising styles such as Batman's in ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', Sherlock Holmes 'prevision' style in Guy Ritchie's two ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' movies.

===Combat reenactment===

'''''The Closing of the American Mind: How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today's Students''''' is a 1987 book by the philosopher [[Allan Bloom]]. In the book, Bloom criticizes the "openness" of [[relativism]], in academia and society in general, as leading [[paradox]]ically to the great "closing" referenced in the book's title. In Bloom's view, "openness" and absolute understanding undermine [[critical thinking]] and eliminate the "point of view" that defines cultures. Bloom's book became an unexpected best seller, eventually selling close to half a million copies in hardback, but drew divided reactions from reviewers.

==Summary==
Bloom critiques the contemporary [[higher education in the United States|American university]] and how he sees it as failing its students, criticizing modern movements in [[philosophy]] and the [[humanities]]. Throughout the book, he attacks the "moral relativism" that he claims has taken over American universities for the barrier it constructs to the notions of truth, critical thinking, and genuine knowledge. Bloom claims that students in the 1980s have prioritized the immediate, blind relegation of prejudice as inferiority of thought, and therefore have "closed" their mind, as the title suggests, to asking the right questions, so that prejudice may be eradicated through logic and critical thinking, as opposed to empty, baseless instinct.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Bloom writes, "Prejudices, strong prejudices, are visions about the way things are.&amp;nbsp;... Error is indeed our enemy, but it alone points to the truth and therefore deserves our respectful treatment. The mind that has no prejudices at the outset is empty."{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=43}}

==="Students"===

In part one, titled "Students",{{sfnm |1a1=Bloom |1y=1987 |1p=45 |2a1=Dixon |2y=1987 |2p=348}} Bloom details how the young American mindset, the books, music, relationships, and other aspects of American [[popular culture]] contribute to the sanctimony of what he perceives to be dull, lazy minds in American universities today.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Bloom contends that the "clean slate" with which students enter universities{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=47}} at first made them more susceptible to genuinely embracing the studies of philosophy and logic.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} But soon, because of "[t]he improved education of the vastly expanded middle class [that] weakened the family's authority",{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=59}} there came a "gradual stilling of the old political and religious echoes" in the students Bloom encountered later in his teaching career. He credits the narrowing and flattening of the American college experience to these phenomena.

Bloom then delves into what he believes is the "[[Great books|Great Books]]" dilemma. He believes that the "great books" of [[Western thought]] have been devalued as a source of wisdom—but more importantly, that "our students have lost the practice of and the taste of reading". Because of this, students are unable to derive their beliefs from evidence, from central texts, or any print source at all. Bloom contends that without an understanding of important older texts, such as [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' or [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'', modern students lack any reference point with which they can critically think about or address current events. Students are instead left with vague and abstract ideas of "good" and "evil".

Bloom notes that the "addiction to music" he observes in modern students is unparalleled, and has been for centuries.{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=68}} But even this, he says, contributes to the closing of the young American mind.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} He notes that fewer and fewer students have a surface level, let alone nuanced, understanding of [[classical music]], and that instead, "rock music is as unquestioned and un-problematic as the air the students breathe."{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=69}} [[Pop music]], he believes, employs sexual images and language to enthrall the young and to persuade them that their petty rebelliousness is authentic politics, when, in fact, they are being controlled by the money-managers whom successful performers like [[Mick Jagger]] quietly serve. He regards the ubiquity of overly sexual overtones in [[1980s in music#Rock|1980s rock music]] and what he perceives to be a subsequent corruption of young minds{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} as a signal of "parents' loss of control over the children's moral education at a time when no one else is seriously concerned with it."{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=76}} Bloom's conclusion about the effects of music on education is that its oversexualization in the late 20th century{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} makes it "very difficult for [students] to have a passionate relationship with the art and thought that are the substance of liberal education, [since] [i]t only artificially induces the exaltation attached to the completion of the greatest endeavors&amp;nbsp;... like discovery of the truth."{{sfn|Bloom|1987|pp=79–80}} Students no longer seek pleasure from the pursuit of learning.

Bloom concludes in "Students" that because of the relationships students have with popular culture, their family, and their peers, they no longer come to university asking questions, seeking instruction, or with imagination.

==="Nihilism, American Style"===

Bloom titles the second part of the book "Nihilism, American Style".{{sfnm |1a1=Bloom |1y=1987 |1p=140 |2a1=Dixon |2y=1987 |2p=348}} He introduces in further detail the concept of "value relativism", mentioned previously only in the introduction. Value [[relativism]], he says, plagues most elite institutions of higher learning. For Bloom, this dissolved into [[nihilism]]. He notices that students follow the path of least resistance when developing their values.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} For students, he writes, "values are not discovered by reason, and it is fruitless to seek them, to find the truth or the good life."{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=143}} Ironically, when travelling this path without reason, Bloom opines, students still "adopt strong poses and fanatic resolutions."{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=143}}

Philosophy professors involved in [[ordinary language philosophy|ordinary language analysis]] or [[logical positivism]] disregard important "humanizing" ethical and political issues and fail to pique the interest of students.{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=378}} Literature professors involved in [[deconstructionism]] promote irrationalism and skepticism of standards of truth and thereby dissolve the moral imperatives which are communicated through genuine philosophy and which elevate and broaden the intellects of those who engage with these imperatives.{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=379}}{{verification needed|date=July 2018}} To a great extent, Bloom's critique extends beyond the university to speak to the general crisis in American society.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} He draws analogies between the United States and the [[Weimar Republic]].{{sfn|Bloom|1987|pp=147–155}} The modern liberal philosophy, he says, enshrined in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought of [[John Locke]]—that a just society could be based upon self-interest alone, coupled by the emergence of relativism in American thought—had led to this crisis. Bloom cites [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s actions of telling "modern man that he was free-falling in the abyss of nihilism",{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=143}} and continues to espouse Nietzsche's commentary that nihilism in our contemporary democracy stems from value relativism.

For Bloom, this created a void in the souls of Americans, into which demagogic radicals as exemplified by 1960s student leaders could leap.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} (Bloom made the comparison to the [[Nazism|Nazi]] brownshirts,{{sfn|Littleford|1988|p=169}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Wolff |first=Robert Paul |author-link=Robert Paul Wolff |year=1987 |title=Review of ''The Closing of the American Mind'' by Allan Bloom |magazine=Academe |volume=73 |issue=5 |location=Washington |publisher=American Association of University Professors |page=65 |doi=10.2307/40250092 |issn=2162-5247}}&lt;/ref&gt; who once similarly filled the gap created in German society by the [[Weimar Republic]].) In the second instance, he argued, the higher calling of philosophy and reason understood as [[freedom of thought]], had been eclipsed by a pseudo-philosophy, or an [[ideology]] of thought. [[Relativism]] was one feature of [[modern liberalism in the United States#Philosophy|modern American liberal philosophy]] that had subverted the Platonic–Socratic teaching.

==="The University"===

Bloom contends that the failure of contemporary [[liberal education]] leads to the sterile social and sexual habits of modern students, and to their inability to fashion a life for themselves beyond the mundane offerings touted as success. Bloom argues that commercial pursuits had become more highly valued than love, the philosophic quest for truth, or the civilized pursuits of honor and glory. In "The University", he discusses how the environment in elite institutions has cultivated mere ambition over the search for truth. He says that proclaiming an affinity for reason does not alone define a university's worth, as the statement alone does not constitute true commitment to scholastic pursuits in the name of a greater truth.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} He contends that "the mere announcement of the rule of reason does not create the conditions for the full exercise of rationality".{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=251}} Universities serve as a reflection of the public and democracy at large.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Because of this, they are slave to public opinion (per [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]).{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=246}} The public opinion—which serves as the final gatekeeper and the final headsmen for any movements the university may actually try to implement to advance the pursuit of critical thinking.

Bloom also explains what he believes is the dichotomy between the "spirit of the university"{{sfn|Bloom|1987}}{{verification needed|date=July 2018}} and the university itself.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} "The philosophic life is not the university."{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=272}} He alludes to early philosophers, who, up until the nineteenth century, including [[Socrates]], who he firmly believes is "of the essence of the university", never once made use of such institutions at all.{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=272}} Bloom posits that maybe, after all, free thought and commitment to a greater truth need not exist within the metaphorical four walls of a university.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} What matters instead, he says, what is "uniquely human", is the "philosophic experience".{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=273}}

Bloom also notices a trend in which students notice the devaluing of free thought in universities. He writes about students at [[Cornell University]], that "these students discerned that their teachers did not really believe that freedom of thought was necessarily a good and useful thing, that they suspected that all this was ideology protecting the injustices of our 'system'".{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=315}} Bloom asserts that American professors in the sixties "were not aware of what they no longer believed"{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=315}} and that this notion gravely endangered any capacity for progress towards free thought.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Bloom insists that requiring from universities empty values like "greater openness", "less rigidity", and "freedom from authority" are only fashionable and do not have any substantive content.{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=320}} And in the face of growing civil rights conflicts, universities have a duty to instead actively pursue the task of "opening American minds". It is not enough, Bloom contends, for universities to "not want trouble".{{sfn|Bloom|1987}}{{verification needed|date=July 2018}} It is not enough for universities to only hold reputation paramount in the face of campus disruption, and only in name espouse free thought and truth. This "unfortunate mixture of cowardice and moralism"{{sfn|Bloom|1987}}{{verification needed|date=July 2018}} will unseat the spirit of the university. Bloom concludes by reminding readers that the love of wisdom and truth must be kept alive in universities, particularly in this moment of world history.

==Publication==
''The Closing of the American Mind'' was published in March 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Piereson |first=James |author-link=James Piereson |year=2007 |title='The Closing of the American Mind' at 20 |url=https://www.newcriterion.com/issues/2007/11/ldquothe-closing-of-the-american-mindrdquo-at-20 |url-access=subscription |magazine=The New Criterion |volume=26 |issue=3 |location=New York |pages=7–8 |access-date=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; five years after Bloom published an essay in the ''[[National Review]]''&lt;ref name="Atlas 1988"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Atlas |first=James |author-link=James Atlas |date=January 3, 1988 |title=Chicago's Grumpy Guru |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/03/magazine/chicago-s-grumpy-guru.html |magazine=The New York Times Magazine |access-date=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the failure of universities to serve the needs of students.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} With the encouragement of [[Saul Bellow]], his colleague at the [[University of Chicago]], he expanded his thoughts into a book "about a life, I've led"&lt;ref name="Atlas 1988"/&gt; that critically reflected on the current state of higher education in American universities. His friends and admirers imagined the work would be a modest success, as did Bloom, who recognized his publisher's modest advance to complete the project as a lack of sales confidence. Yet on the momentum of strong initial reviews,{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} including one by [[Christopher Lehmann-Haupt]] in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lehmann-Haupt |first=Christopher |author-link=Christopher Lehmann-Haupt |date=March 23, 1987 |title=Books of the Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/23/books/books-of-the-times-314187.html |newspaper=The New York Times |page=C18 |access-date=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an op-ed piece by syndicated [[conservatism|conservative]] commentator [[George Will]] entitled "A How-To Book for the Independent"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Will |first=George F. |author-link=George Will |date=July 30, 1987 |title=A How-To Book for the Independent |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1987/07/30/a-how-to-book-for-the-independent/5dd0f510-81cb-4d4b-a0ba-8fe599b1d41f/ |work=The Washington Post |access-date=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became an unexpected best seller, eventually selling close to half a million copies in hardback and remaining at number one on ''The New York Times'' Non-fiction Best Seller list for four months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Goldstein |first=William |date=June 3, 1987 |title=The Story behind the Best Seller: Allan Bloom's ''Closing of the American Mind'' |magazine=Publishers Weekly |issn=0000-0019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
''The Closing of the American Mind'' was met with mixed reviews from scholars and the general public alike.

===Positive===

The art critic [[Roger Kimball]], writing in ''The New York Times'', called ''The Closing of the American Mind'' "an unparalleled reflection on the whole question of what it means to be a student in today's intellectual and moral climate."&lt;ref name="Kimball 1987"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kimball |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Kimball |date=April 5, 1987 |title=The Groves of Ignorance |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/05/books/the-groves-of-ignorance.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimball argues that Bloom's work should not be diminished publicly simply because it is not optimistic. Instead, he writes, "'The Closing of the American Mind' is essential reading for anyone concerned with the state of liberal education in this society. Its pathos, erudition and penetrating insight make it an unparalleled reflection on the whole question of what it means to be a student in today's intellectual and moral climate."&lt;ref name="Kimball 1987"/&gt; He concludes that,
{{quote|Mr. Bloom paints a sobering if not, alas, entirely unfamiliar picture.&amp;nbsp;... [O]ne of the chief things to appreciate about "The Closing of the American Mind" is that its dominant stance is interrogative, not prescriptive. Everything problematic that the term modernity implies, all the doubts about the meaning of tradition, the legitimacy of inherited values, the point of preserving high culture—all this Mr. Bloom is perfectly cognizant of.&lt;ref name="Kimball 1987"/&gt;}}

Matt Feeney from ''[[The New Yorker]]'' also wrote in his article, "Allan Bloom's Guide to College", in 2012, that while Bloom's core arguments may have been diluted into trite conservative barbs directed at liberal educations, the essence of his argument remains true today, and his motives do too. He explains that by writing ''The Closing of the American Mind,'' "Bloom dangles the promise of an arousing and dangerous philosophical quest, which will take the student far from his (and his friends' and parents' and other professors') settled opinions about what is good and decent."&lt;ref name="Feeney 2012"&gt;{{cite news |last=Feeney |first=Matt |date=April 12, 2012 |title=Allan Bloom's Guide to College |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/allan-blooms-guide-to-college |work=The New Yorker |access-date=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for Bloom's impact on this era of politics, Feeney suggests a reframe in the way consumers perceive Bloom's work. Feeney writes,
{{quote|Bloom's light, urgent prose makes it easy to forget how audacious this chapter is in its depth, breadth, and seriousness, and how defiant it is in its defense of liberal education. Bloom's knee-jerk opponents tend to be leftists, but these people are merely symptoms of a deeper modern distrust of liberal learning. It might be better, then, to reframe Bloom's project, from a secretly erotic quest for sublime knowledge to an existentially urgent battle for nonconformity; real weirdness in a world that wants to co-opt everything, make everything productive for and comprehensible to everyone.&lt;ref name="Feeney 2012"/&gt;}}

The [[neoconservatism|neoconservative]] writer [[Norman Podhoretz]] embraced Bloom's argument, noting that the closed-mindedness in his title refers to the paradoxical consequence of the academic "open mind" found in liberal political thought—namely "the narrow and intolerant dogmatism" that dismisses any attempt, by Plato or the [[Hebrew Bible]] for example, to provide a rational basis for moral judgments. Podhoretz continued, "Bloom goes on to charge liberalism with vulgarizing the noble ideals of freedom and equality, and he offers brilliantly acerbic descriptions of the sexual revolution and the feminist movement, which he sees as products of this process of vulgarization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Podhoretz |first=Norman |author-link=Norman Podhoretz |year=1987 |title=Conservative Book Becomes a Best-Seller |work=Human Events |volume=47 |issue=28 |location=Washington |pages=5–6 |issn=0018-7194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloom's work was also supported by a larger conservative movement. In 2005, [[Jim Sleeper]] wrote for ''The New York Times'' that "nothing prepared [conservatives'] movement, or the academic and publishing worlds, for the wildfire success of [the book].&amp;nbsp;... Conservatives championed Bloom then, of course, and they invoke him still."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sleeper |first=Jim |author-link=Jim Sleeper |date=September 4, 2005 |title=Allan Bloom and the Conservative Mind |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/04/books/review/allan-bloom-and-the-conservative-mind.html |url-access=limited |work=The New York Times |access-date=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1989 article, Ann Clark Fehn discussed the critical reception of the book, noting that it had eclipsed other titles that year dealing with higher education (''College'' by [[Ernest L. Boyer]] and ''Cultural Literacy'' by [[E.&amp;nbsp;D. Hirsch]]), and quoting ''Publishers Weekly'', which had described Bloom's book as a "bestseller made by reviews".{{sfn|Fehn|1989|p=384}} The poet [[Frederick Turner (poet)|Frederick Turner]] described ''The Closing of the American Mind'' as, "The most thoughtful conservative analysis of the nation's cultural sickness."{{sfn|Turner|1995|p=277}}

The critic [[Camille Paglia]] called ''The Closing of the American Mind'' "the first shot in the culture wars", writing of Bloom that she was "confident that in the long run he will be vindicated and his critics swallowed in obscurity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Paglia |first=Camille |author-link=Camille Paglia |date=July 22, 1997 |title=Ask Camille |url=http://www.salon.com/july97/columnists/paglia2970722.html |work=Salon.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991128143344/http://www.salon.com/july97/columnists/paglia2970722.html |archive-date=November 28, 1999 |access-date=May 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative===

In her review, [[Martha Nussbaum]] questioned whether Bloom deserved to be considered a philosopher.{{sfn|Nussbaum|2012|p=45}} The criticism of the book was continued by impassioned reviews by [[Benjamin Barber]] in ''[[Harper's]]'';&lt;ref name="Atlas 1988"/&gt; by the [[Nietzschean]] scholar {{citation needed span |date=July 2018 |text=of ancient philosophy}} [[Alexander Nehamas]] in the ''[[London Review of Books]]'';&lt;ref name="Atlas 1988"/&gt;{{sfn|Thompson|2010|p=181}} and by [[David Rieff]] in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''.&lt;ref name="Atlas 1988"/&gt; [[David Rieff]] called Bloom "an academic version of Lieut. Col. [[Oliver North|Oliver L. North]]: vengeful, reactionary, antidemocratic."&lt;ref name="Atlas 1988"/&gt; The book, he said, was one that "decent people would be ashamed of having written."&lt;ref name="Atlas 1988"/&gt; The tone of these reviews led [[James Atlas]] in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' to conclude "the responses to Bloom's book have been charged with a hostility that transcends the usual mean-spiritedness of reviewers."&lt;ref name="Atlas 1988"/&gt;

[[William Greider]] wrote for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that there were two main reasons for the roaring commercial success of Bloom's work. The first, he says, is purely due to the "impassioned quality of Bloom's prose. The professor's rhetoric is laced with high-blown discourses on his great-books heroes and his enemies list&amp;nbsp;... The average reader is undoubtedly flattered by Bloom's intellectual name-dropping; it's always fun to be high-minded about someone else's ignorance."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Greider |first=William |author-link=William Greider |date=October 8, 1987 |title=Bloom and Doom: 'The Closing of the American Mind' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/bloom-and-doom-19871008 |work=Rolling Stone |location=New York |issn=0035-791X |access-date=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second reason Greider credits Bloom's success to is simply timing. He writes that "the book's appearance coincides with a surge of national concern about the disappearance of traditional education. Another current best seller, ''Cultural Literacy'', by E.D. Hirsch Jr., also taps the same anxieties."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ultimately, Greider concludes that Bloom's agenda is simply vicious attack on the values of young America. He writes,
{{quote|Bloom's real agenda is much darker—to launch a nasty, reactionary attack on the values of young people and everyone else under forty. His multi-count indictment is a laundry list of cheap slanders made to sound vaguely authoritative, because, after all, Bloom is a teacher who supposedly hangs out with students. In fact, Bloom sounds bewildered by young people—and strangely out of touch with them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;}}
For Greider, it is unfathomable how Bloom could devile the decline in prejudice and relegate that decline to a lack of imagination. He concludes, "Bloom apparently detests the young."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The linguist and philosopher [[Noam Chomsky]] dismissed Bloom's book as "mind-bogglingly stupid" for "basically saying&amp;nbsp;... you just march the students through a canon of 'great thoughts' that are picked out for everybody" when "the effect of that is that students will end up knowing and understanding virtually nothing."{{sfn|Chomsky|2002|p=233}}

===Legacy===

The jurist [[Richard Posner]] compared Bloom's book to Paglia's ''[[Sexual Personae]]'' (1990), finding both books to be examples of "difficult academic works that mysteriously strike a chord with a broad public."{{sfn|Posner|2001|p=103}} Thus, since publication, ''The Closing of the American Mind'', fueled many impassioned debates about the state of culture in America. One prominent retaliation{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} came from the American historian [[Lawrence W. Levine]], whose book was titled ''The Opening of the American Mind''.{{sfn|Levine|1996}} According to ''The New York Times''{{'}} [[Edward Rothstein]], Levine's work, published ten full years later, still found it relevant to "praise what Bloom condemned and condemn what he praised."&lt;ref name="Rothstein 1997"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rothstein |first=Edward |author-link=Edward Rothstein |date=May 27, 1997 |title=As Culture Wars Go on, Battle Lines Blur a Bit |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/27/arts/as-culture-wars-go-on-battle-lines-blur-a-bit.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; But where, initially, political conservatives espoused Bloom's theories and liberals disavowed it, things seemed to be changing. According to Rothstein, ten years later, in 1997, the lines between supporter and opponent were no longer so clear. He found that, "many conservatives have no problem with diversity if it is accompanied by rigor; many liberals have no problem with rigor if it is accompanied by diversity. And the view that something is amiss in contemporary culture is becoming increasingly widespread."&lt;ref name="Rothstein 1997"/&gt; Ultimately, Rothstein concludes, Bloom's work has very little to do "with current political demarcations."&lt;ref name="Rothstein 1997"/&gt;

Jerry Aaron Snyder of ''[[The New Republic]]'', however, argues that the [[culture war]]s, which Bloom's work clearly helped spark a conversation about, will consistently be relevant. While it may be argued that ''The Closing of the American Mind'' may not resign itself to a political party, this does not preclude it from the impact it had on the culture wars, and how those culture wars shape life today. Snyder argues that books like Bloom's have inspired further conversations and controversies alike, such as controversy surrounding how history is taught in high schools, or the effectiveness of [[affirmative action]] or [[identity politics]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news |last=Snyder |first=Jeffrey Aaron |date=April 23, 2015 |title=America Will Never Move beyond the Culture Wars |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/121627/war-soul-america-history-culture-wars-review |work=The New Republic |location=New York |access-date=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Snyder, the discussions spawned by the initial culture wars in the 1980s because of books like Bloom's, "'the soul of America' is a bottomless well. For better or worse, it will never run dry."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''''The Hatchet Man''''' (1932) is a [[Pre-Code Hollywood|pre-Code film]] directed by [[William A. Wellman]] and starring [[Edward G. Robinson]]. [[Warner Bros.]] had purchased the [[David Belasco]]/[[Achmed Abdullah]] play ''The Honorable Mr. Wong'' about the [[Tong (organization)|Tong]] gang wars. Made during the few years before strict enforcement of the [[Production Code]], ''The Hatchet Man'' has elements that would not be allowed later, such as adultery, [[narcotics]], and a somewhat graphic use of a flying hatchet.

==Plot summary==
Wong Low Get (Edward G. Robinson) is the most highly respected hatchet man of his [[Tong (organization)|Tong]]. Having sworn total allegiance, he cannot turn down an order, even one to kill his best friend Sun Yat Ming ([[J. Carrol Naish]]). His friend forgives him in advance of his execution, begging only that Wong raise his daughter Toya San (Loretta Young) as his own. Wong does as he has sworn, but as she grows up, he falls in love with her. She marries him out of a sense of obligation, but a handsome younger gangster, Harry En Hai (Leslie Fenton), gets her to leave Wong, disgracing him and leading to a shocking turn of events.

==Cast (in credits order)==

As was typical of the time, almost no Asian actors appear in the cast of a film set completely among Chinese characters. Makeup artists had noticed that audiences were more likely to reject Western actors in Asian disguise if the faces of actual Asians were in near proximity. Rather than cast the film with all Asian actors, which would have then meant no star names to attract American audiences, studios simply eliminated most of the Asian actors from the cast. That said, this film contains a number of Asian actors in minor roles, including [[Toshia Mori]] and [[Willie Fung]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C03E6D91E3FE633A25757C0A9649C946394D6CF Movie Review, The Greeks Had a Word for Them (1932) - Edward G.

'''United States Artists''' ('''USA''') is an independent nonprofit and nongovernmental [[philanthropic organization]] based in Chicago and dedicated to supporting the work of living American artists by the granting of cash awards, called [[List of United States Artists (USA) Fellowship recipients|USA Fellowships]].&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, "[http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2006/09/25/art_for_our_sake/ Art for our sake]," ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', September 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 2005 with initial funding from the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], The [[Prudential Foundation]], and the Rasmuson Foundation, and the first set of 50 fellowships were announced in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Cole, [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aV4ZXOmY4AXM "Seminole Filmmaker, Guitarist Awarded $50,000 Grants" (Update1)], [[Bloomberg.com]], December 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is governed by a Board of Directors and receives additional funding from several major American foundations, corporate partners, and private citizens.

== Mission ==

The organization's stated mission is "to invest in America's finest artists and illuminate the value of artists to society."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/about/|title=United States Artists}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the organization asserts that "[[List of United States Artists (USA) Fellowship recipients|USA Fellowships]] honor and award an artist’s unique vision as a whole rather than funding a particular project. Artists at different career levels, from emerging to established, are eligible."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/connect#faq|title=United States Artists  » Connect|website=www.unitedstatesartists.org|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selection process ==

Prerequisites for consideration include that the artist be 21 or older, a [[US citizen]] or [[legal resident]]. In addition, nominees must be accomplished artists, must have acquired art training, formal or informal, must have tried to derive income from those skills, and must have been "actively engaged in creating artwork and presenting it to the public." To be considered for a grant, an artist must first be nominated by at least one of a group of "nominators" chosen by the organization. This is an anonymous group of arts scholars, critics, and artists from various disciplines; they operate independently of one another. The nominators submit names of artists they believe should be considered for an award.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Once nominated artists have been notified of their nomination, they are then directed to apply for the grant in order to be considered. The awards are announced once a year. The Fellows announcement is made in December of each year.

==Grants==

Grants are awarded annually to artists working in nine disciplines:

{{Refimprove|date=October 2016}}
[[File:Cratère de Vix 0023.jpg|thumb|400px|The Vix [[Krater]], an imported Greek wine-mixing vessel found in the famous grave of the "Lady of Vix"]]
The '''Vix Grave''' is a [[tumulus|burial mound]] near the village of [[Vix, Côte-d'Or|Vix]] ({{IPA-fr|vi}}) in northern [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. The broader site is a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] [[Celts|Celtic]] complex from the Late [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and Early [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] periods, consisting of a fortified settlement and several burial mounds.

The grave of the ''Lady of Vix'', dating to circa 500 BC, had never been disturbed and thus contained remarkably rich grave offerings.  Known in French as the ''Trésor de Vix'', these included a great deal of jewellery and the "Vix [[krater]]", the largest known metal vessel from Western [[classical antiquity]], being 1.63 m (5'4") in height.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-vix.fr/fr/ Vix-Musée-du-Pays-Châtillonnais: Trésor-de-Vix]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
The sites are located near the village of Vix, about 6 km north of [[Châtillon-sur-Seine]], in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Côte-d'Or]], in northeastern Burgundy. The complex is centred on Mont Lassois, a steep flat-topped hill that dominates the area. It was the site of a fortified Celtic settlement, or [[oppidum]]. To the southeast of the hill, there was a 42-hectare [[necropolis]] with graves ranging from the Late [[Bronze Age]] via the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] Culture to Late [[La Tène culture|La Tène]]. Other finds indicate activity up to [[Late Antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuerstensitze.de/1117_Mont_Lassois.html Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft "Early centralization and urbanization processes - On the Genesis and Development 'Early Celtic Princely Seats' : Mont Lassois]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the sixth and fifth centuries BC, the Vix (or Mont Lassois) settlement appears to have controlled a major trading node, where the [[Seine]], an important riverine transport route linking eastern and western France, crossed the land route leading from the [[Mediterranean]] to northern Europe. Additionally, Vix is at the centre of an agriculturally rich plain.

== History of discovery ==
[[File:Cratère de Vix 0016.jpg|thumb|300px|Vix krater: Frieze of hoplites and four-horse chariots on the rim]]
Discovery of archaeological material in the area, originally by a locally based amateur, began in April 1930. Increasingly systematic work throughout the following decades revealed thousands of [[pottery]] sherds, [[Fibula, or ancient brooch|fibulae]], jewellery, and other bronze and iron finds. The famous burial mound with the [[krater]] was excavated in early 1953 by René Jouffroi. In 1991 new archaeological research on and around Mont Lassois began under the direction of Bruno Chaume. Since 2001 a programme of research titled “Vix et son environnement” began, uniting the resources of several universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.musee-vix.fr/fr/_upload/26c2729367f62a9eadcfc6e1005e88eb.pdf |title=Archéologie en Bourgogne: Vix (CÔTE-D’OR), Une Résidence Princière Au Temps De La Splendeur D’Athènes 2011 |access-date=2014-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714135846/http://www.musee-vix.fr/fr/_upload/26c2729367f62a9eadcfc6e1005e88eb.pdf |archive-date=2014-07-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The oppidum of Mont Lassois ==
===Fortifications and architecture===
[[File:Vix palace late 6th century B.C..jpg|thumb|300px|Vix palace, late 6th century B.C.]]
[[File:Vix palace France, late 6th century B.C..jpg|thumb|300px|Vix palace, late 6th century B.C.]]
Excavation of the settlement on the summit of Mont Lassois revealed extensive fortifications, with ditches and walls up to 8 m thick. The walls were built in the ''[[Pfostenschlitzmauer]]'' technique, but also yielded nails of the type common in ''[[murus gallicus]]'' walls. Excavation inside the enclosure revealed a variety of buildings, including post houses, [[Grubenhaus|pit dwellings]], hearths, and storage units built on stilts. [[Geophysics|Geophysical]] work shows a large planned settlement, with a central, north–south axis and several phases of buildings.

===The "Palace of the Lady of Vix"===
In 2006, a remarkable architectural unit was discovered at the centre of the site. It is a large complex of two or three buildings, the main one measuring 35 by 21 m, with an estimated height of 12 m: the dimensions of a modern church. The large hall had an [[apse]] at the back and a front porch ''[[in antis]]''. Overall, the central unit resembles the [[megaron]] complex of early [[Greek architecture]]. Such a find is unprecedented in early Celtic Europe. Finds suggested domestic use or feasting uses. The structure has been described as the "Palace" of the Lady of Vix (''Palais de la Dame de Vix'').

===Finds===
The many individual finds from the Lassois oppidum clearly demonstrate the settlement's long and wide-ranging trade contacts, as well as its own role as an economic centre. The most common finds are shards of pottery, with more than 40,000 recorded to date. Many are local products, decorated with simple geometric motifs (checkerboard patterns) and occasional depictions of animals. There also have been finds of imported [[Attic]] [[black figure]] vases from Greece. Many [[amphorae]] and bowls could be identified as coming from the contemporary Greek-settled areas of southern France. The amphorae had been used for transporting wine.

Jewellery included [[fibula, or ancient brooch|fibulae]], commonly decorated with [[amber]] or [[coral]], earrings, beads, slate bracelets, and rings. Glass ornaments also were found. Some small bronze figurines found are probably of Mediterranean origin. Little weaponry has been found as yet, the majority of it [[projectiles]] and axes.

===Status===
Mont Lassois has all the features of a high-status settlement: large fortifications, the presence of a [[citadel]] and a lower town, rare and fine imported materials, as well as numerous rich burial mounds in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.musee-vix.fr/fr/_upload/26c2729367f62a9eadcfc6e1005e88eb.pdf |title=Archéologie en Bourgogne: Vix (CÔTE-D’OR), Une Résidence Princière Au Temps De La Splendeur D’Athènes 2011 |access-date=2014-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714135846/http://www.musee-vix.fr/fr/_upload/26c2729367f62a9eadcfc6e1005e88eb.pdf |archive-date=2014-07-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The burial mounds==
=== The 1953 Vix Grave ===
[[File:Cratère de Vix 0009.jpg|thumb|250px|One of the krater's volute handles, each were supported by a rampant [[lion|lioness]]]]
The burial of "the Lady of Vix" took place around [[500 B.C.]] Although decomposition of the organic contents of the grave was nearly total, the gender of the individual buried has been interpreted as female: she is accompanied by many items of jewellery, but no weaponry. Her social status is not clear and other than "Lady," names such as, ''Queen'', ''Princess'', or ''Priestess of Vix'' have all been used in various articles involving conjecture. There can be no doubt of her high status, as indicated by the large amounts of jewellery. She was between 30 years and 35 years old at the time of her death.

====Burial and grave goods====
[[File:Gold_torque_1.jpg|thumb|300px|A unique 24 carat Celtic [[torc]], whose ends are adorned with winged horses on intricate [[filigree]] pedestals and lion paws, inspired by Etruscan, Scythian or Middle Eastern bestiary]]
The [[inhumation]] burial was placed in a 4m x 4m rectangular wooden chamber underneath a mound or [[tumulus]] of earth and stone which originally measured 42m in diameter and 5m in height.

Her body was laid in the freestanding box of a cart, or [[chariot]], the wheels of which had been detached and placed beside it. Only its metal parts have survived. Her jewellery included a 480&amp;nbsp;gram 24-carat gold [[torc]], a bronze torc, six fibulae, six slate bracelets, plus a seventh bracelet made of [[amber]] beads.

The grave also contained an assemblage of imported objects from [[Italy]] and the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] world, all of them associated with the preparation of wine. They included the famous krater (see below), a silver [[phiale (libation vessel)|phiale]] (shallow bowl, sometimes seen as a local product), an [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] bronze [[oinochoe]] (wine jug), and several drinking cups from [[Etruria]] and [[Attica]]. One of the latter was dated as c. 525 BC and represents the latest firmly dated find in the grave. It thus provides the best evidence, a ''[[terminus post quem]]'' for its date. The vessels probably were placed on wooden tables or benches that did not survive.

====The Vix krater====
[[File:Vix krater.jpg|thumb|300px|Châtillon-sur-Seine |A [[Gorgon]] head is on the outside of each of the krater's two handles ]]
The largest and most famous of the finds from the burial is an elaborately decorated bronze [[volute]] [[krater]] of 1.63m (5'4") height and over 200kg (450lbs) weight. [[Krater]]s were vessels for mixing wine and water, common in the Greek world, and usually made of clay. The Vix krater has become an iconic object representing both the wealth of early Celtic burials and the art of Late [[Archaic Greece|Archaic Greek]] bronze work.

*The krater was made of seven or more individual pieces with [[Greek alphabet|alphabetical]] markings&lt;ref&gt;Cook, R. M. 1979. Three Conjectures. ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'' 99. 152-155.&lt;/ref&gt;, indicating that it probably was transported to Burgundy in pieces and assembled ''in situ''.
*The vase proper, made of a single sheet of hammered [[bronze]], weighs about 60kg. Its bottom is rounded, its maximum diameter is 1.27m, and its capacity is 1,100&amp;nbsp;litres. Its walls are only 1mm to 1.3mm thick. The krater was found crushed by the weight of the tumulus material above it. It had telescoped completely: the handles were found at the same level as the base. It was restored after excavation.
*Its foot is made of a single moulded piece, its diameter is 74cm, its weight 20.2kg. It received the rounded bottom of the main vase and ensured its stability. It is decorated with stylised plant motifs.
*The three handles, supported by rampant [[lion|lioness]]es, weighed about 46kg each. Each is a 55cm high [[volute]], each is elaborately decorated with a grimacing [[gorgoneion|gorgon]], a common motif on contemporary Greek bronzes.
*A frieze of [[hoplites]] decorates the neck of the vessel, which is made of a bronze ring inserted into the main vase and supporting the handles. It depicts eight chariots, each drawn by four horses and conducted by a charioteer (depicted smaller than the hoplites for reasons of space), each is followed by a single fully armed hoplite on foot. The frieze is an important example of early Greek bronze [[relief]] art, which has rarely survived.
*The lid was a hammered bronze sheet, weighing 13.8kg and shaped to fit the krater's opening. It is concave and perforated by multiple holes, probably because it also served as a strainer for purifying wine. A protrusion at its centre supports a 19cm statuette of moulded bronze, depicting a woman with one outstretched arm, which once may have held some object such as a [[Kottabos|plastinx]]. She wears a [[peplos]], the body-length [[Ancient Greek]] garment worn by women, and her head is covered by a veil. The statuette appears of a somewhat older style than figures on the rest of the vessel.

====Significance====
The enormous variety of apparently Mediterranean imports indicates wide-ranging trade connections; in particular, the Mediterranean material might have come to Vix with Greek or Etruscan traders. The wealth of imported luxury goods at Vix is, so far, unique in La Tène Europe. It has been suggested that the krater, the largest known Greek bronze vessel, should be seen in a context of high-status gift exchange connected with the trade of wine from the Mediterranean for raw materials from northern Europe.

====Exhibition and reconstruction====
A reconstruction of the grave and the original finds are on display in the museum at [[Châtillon-sur-Seine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-vix.fr/fr/ Vix-Musée-du-Pays-Châtillonnais: Trésor-de-Vix]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further tumuli ===
Apart from this woman's grave (mound I), there are five further known large burial mounds in the area. Three of them have been excavated so far. 
*Mound II had a diameter of 33 m; its central chamber contained an urn with cremated human remains, dated by accompanying finds to c. 850 BC.
*The mound of [[La Butte (Vix)|La Butte]] probably dates to the mid-sixth century. As in its famous neighbouring grave, it contained a woman laid in a cart, or chariot, accompanied by two iron [[axe]]s and a gold bracelet.
*A third mound, at [[La Garenne (Vix)|La Garenne]], was destroyed in 1846. It, too, contained a cart, as well as an Etruscan bronze bowl with four [[griffin]] or [[lion|lioness]] handles. It is not known whether it contained skeletal remains.

===Statues===
In 1994, fragments of two stone statues, a warrior, and a figure of a woman, were discovered in a small enclosure.

==Significance==
[[File:Vix crater hoplite circa 500 BCE.jpg|thumb|A [[Hoplite]] (probably Spartan), on the Vix Crater.]]
In the area, as elsewhere in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Western Europe]], the early [[Iron Age]] led to changes in social organisation, including a marked tendency toward the development of social [[hierarchy|hierarchies]]. It seems that at the top of these hierarchies was an aristocracy that had developed in the context of the increasingly important trade in [[iron ore]] and [[iron]]. Whether they really were "princesses" or "princes" in a modern sense (i.e., a noble or religious aristocracy) or simply represented an economic or mercantile elite is still the subject of much discussion.

Evidence for these changed social conditions is seen in the richly equipped graves of this period, which stand in sharp contrast to the preceding habit of uniform simple urn burials. It is also seen in the changing settlement patterns of the region. Whereas large open settlements had previously served as central places, smaller enclosed settlements developed, often in locally prominent locations (so called [[Manorialism|manor]]s or ''princely sites''). Several of these sites are known from Late Hallstatt and Early La Tène Europe, for example, the burials at [[Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave|Hochdorf]] and [[Magdalenenberg]], the [[Heuneburg]] settlement and the [[Glauberg]] settlement and burial complex. 

Iron ores were far more widespread than the rarer materials needed to produce the previously dominant [[bronze]]: [[copper]], but especially, [[tin]]. Thus, economic success ceased to be determined simply by access to the raw materials, but started to depend on infrastructure and trade. The increasing economic surplus in well-situated places was invested in representative settlements (and fortifications), jewellery, and expensive imported luxury materials, a differentiation not previously possible.

'''Welfare State International''' was a [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British]] [[experimental theatre]] group formed in 1968 by John Fox&lt;ref name=dggjf/&gt; and Sue Gill&lt;ref name=dggsg/&gt;, Roger Coleman&lt;ref name=WSIArch/&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nuttall|first=Jeff|title=Performance Art Memoirs|volume=1|year=1979|publisher=John Calder|isbn=0714537888|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became "A collective of radical artists and thinkers who explored ideas of celebratory art and spectacle between 1968 and 2006."&lt;ref name=WSIArch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welfare-state.org/pages/aboutwsi.htm|title=Welfare State International - About WSI|work=welfare-state.org|accessdate = 26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The company's name was originally 'The Welfare State', based on the concept of offering art for all on the same basis as education and health.&lt;ref name=WSIArch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1970sproject.co.uk/events/papers/gillian-whiteley.pdf|title=‘New Age’ radicalism and the social imagination: Welfare State International in the Seventies  |work=1970sproject.co.uk|first=Gillian |last=Whiteley }}{{Deadlink | date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/12293/3/Whiteley-Final%20accepted%20paper.pdf |title=‘New Age’ radicalism and the social imagination: Welfare State International in the Seventies |first=Gillian |last=Whiteley |work=dspace.lboro.ac.uk |accessdate = 30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welfare State International was initially known for staging large-scale outdoor spectacular events. At this time (the late 1960s), forsaking theatres and galleries for the street was unusual.

In November 2001, Welfare State International was described by the [[The Guardian|Guardian]] Guide as "Britain's foremost arts and installations collective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welfare-state.org/pages/john.htm|title=Welfare State International - John Fox|work=welfare-state.org|accessdate = 26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welfare State International's 'The Raising of the Titanic' (Limehouse Basin, London, 1983) has been listed among "Productions that transformed theatre".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/apr/01/experimental-theatre-spill-festival|title=Guardian article (2009/apr/01) ''Experimental theatre to spill into the mainstream'' |work=theguardian.com |accessdate = 26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welfare State International ceased operating on April Fools' Day 2006 after a performance at [[Ulverston]].&lt;ref name=dggjf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadgoodguides.co.uk/?page_id=2250|title=Dead Good Guides page for John Fox |work=deadgoodguides.com|accessdate = 26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dggsg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadgoodguides.co.uk/?page_id=2254 |title=Dead Good Guides page for Sue Gill |work=deadgoodguides.com|accessdate = 26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
